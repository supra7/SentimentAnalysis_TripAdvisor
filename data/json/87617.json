Stayed int the West tower and had a lovely corner room on the 21st floor with a view down the street and into the Pritzker Pavillion and the Art Institute. Room was spacious and minibar was fully stocked... Bed was extremely comfy, TV was a new LED flatscreen and the bathroom was extremely spacious and modern. The good bar is in the East tower and is always great for (expensive) cocktails. Bell staff and Front Desk were very friendly.

It was my second time staying at this hotel, but this stay was just as pleasant as 3 summers ago. The location is right on the Chicago River which on St. Paddy's Day weekend just happens to be a glowing bright green. If you haven't seen that before, you really need to check it out! I like that the rooms have 2 Queen beds instead of 2 Doubles like most hotels in the city. The bathroom is very nice and the bed was very comfy. This was a quick girls' weekend trip and we spent most of our time out exploring but when we were in the room we didn't feel like there wasn't enough space. If you can get the side with river views, that's even better, but like I said we didn't spend time in the room besides getting ready and sleeping so that wasn't a big deal for us. Another bonus was the ipod dock so we could have some tunes in the room, nice touch. We were in the last room at the end of the hall and even with a packed hotel and all the St. Paddy's Day revelry going on, our room was quiet once we were finally ready to sleep. This is a small detail but there is a desk as well as a wide tv console/dresser which meant lots of available space for us to have all our stuff lying around. We girls tend to bring too much haha ;-) One thing to keep in mind is there are ice machines on every floor but not vending. So if you want a canned/bottled soft drink or water, you need to go to the lobby to get it (a kiosk open 24 hrs).

I can not say anything bad about the hotel.

Now, for my detailed review: First, I must say that this review builds upon prior review of this property -- for further information and some more details on this property, please see my prior review: -November 2010, entitled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A truly AMAZING Hyatt!! A perfect location with stellar service!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (posted November 8, 2010) Having stayed at this property before, my wife and I were expecting similarly excellent service, and we were most definitely not let down. The Hyatt Regency Chicago provided us with the perfect place to stay in Downtown Chicago. We arrived very late at night, due to a late flight from Florida. Upon arrival at Chicago O'Hare, we were met by a driver that had been arranged for us by the Concierge at this excellent property -- if you need to get to this property from either of the Chicago area airports, I highly recommend contacting the hotel concierge prior to your arrival as he or she will be able to arrange a very skilled driver for an extremely reasonable price! Our driver arrived right on time to pick us up, and he was extremely professional and courteous, quickly getting us to the entrance to the Hyatt Regency Chicago. Upon arrival in the lobby, we we met by an excellent bellman who assisted us with our luggage, and who directed us to the Hyatt Gold Passport Check-in Desk. This property has excellent front desk service, with a very large and separate area dedicated solely to the needs of Hyatt Gold Passport Members. Check-in was extremely quick and efficient at this dedicated Hyatt Gold Passport Desk -- we were welcomed by name and thanked for being repeat guests and loyal Diamond Level Gold Passport Members. And, within a matter of moments, we were on our way up to our Suite, room 3614. All-in-all, a very quick and efficient check-in offering excellent customer service. Upon arrival at our room, we were very excited to see that we were once again in an excellent suite -- the suites at this property are extremely nice, and I highly recommend splurging and booking a suite at this newly renovated property. As we walked into our room through the double doors, we entered into a beautiful tiled entryway, with a wet bar directly to our left and a large and freshly entered bathroom to our right. The bathroom had clearly been recently renovated, offering a beautiful vanity, plush towels, a very large shower and a toilet. This bathroom had a separate entry into the bedroom portion of the room as well. Going back into the entry way, directly in front of us, we had an extremely comfortable couch with a coffee table, and a large HD-television. To the left of this living area was a dining area, complete with a large dining table and a nicely sized computer desk. And, all the way across both the dining area and the living area there were wonderful floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a beautiful view of the Chicago Skyline and slight view of the Chicago River. Then, as for the bedroom, it was equipped with an extremely soft and comfortable Hyatt Grand Bed, a computer desk, a large HD-television and similar floor-to-ceiling windows. All-in-all, an excellent and freshly renovated room that provided for a truly wonderful stay! In addition to the excellent room, this property has some truly top-notch dining experiences. For breakfast, I highly recommend \"The Bistro at 151.\" This restaurant offers an excellent buffet at a reasonable rate. However, we opted to order off of the menu instead -- and, we were extremely happy with our selections ... I highly recommend the Eggs Benedict! Breakfast was truly one of the best hotel breakfasts that we have ever experienced. Additionally, for drinks at light appetizers, the \"BIG Bar\" is wonderful! Offering up beautiful city views, excellent appetizers and truly tasty strong drinks. \"BIG Bar\" should not be missed for anyone who enjoys a good drink. Furthermore, for anyone like us that enjoys a truly amazing steak, \"Stetson's Chop House\" should not be missed. As the property description indicates, this is truly one of the finest steakhouses in Chicago. Offering an excellent wine selection, AMAZING service and truly succulent steaks, you should not miss \"Stetson's.\" In addition to the excellent dining, this property truly is in the perfect location -- just across the Chicago River from the \"Magnificent Mile\" aka \"Michigan Avenue\" which offers very excellent shopping and dining. It is also a very quick cab ride to all of the area museums -- and, if you want to visit Chicago's excellent museums, make sure to speak with the hotel concierge, as this property often has specials and discounts which can save you a lot of money. All-in-all, the Hyatt Regency Chicago is a truly wonderful and newly renovated property that offers excellent service in a prime location. This property should not be missed by anyone traveling to Chicago!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNever Again Will I Stay Here - Horrible Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "Consultant2468", "ReviewID": "UR126254584", "Content": "I should have learned my lesson. Every year in March I attend a meeting held here. I usually stay around the corner at the Fairmont or just up the street at the Swiss Hotel. For some reason this year I forgot how horrible this Hyatt is. Here is a summary: 1. Failure to honor a reservation. Even though a special room was requested at time of reservation and even though i called the afternoon I was to arrive to verify that special room request, when I arrived at 6:30 pm, the room was not available. \"There is nothing we can do, we are full.\" 2. When I arrived in the room (6th floor West Tower) the room reeked of cigarette smoke -- really?? Yes, really, even in 2012. And those f you who have had this know that nothing can be done. I did call -- I told my story and then was sent to a second person to tell the entire story a second time -- the first offer was, \"we will have housekeeping come and spray.\" Of course those of us who travel frequently know this will not work. Then \"if you can leave the room for a couple of hours, we can put a machine in there.\" Leave the room? Not possible then - certainly the next day. \"Well, we could buy you dinner and then you could return to the room. Again, I had work to do, not time to sit alone for two hours in a restaurant waiting for the room to be de-odorized. And of course, they were full. NOTHING could be done. 3. Room service -- the first night -- to begin with, I was on hold for 15 minutes -- at 9 pm and then I ordered tomato soup, a reuben with fruit as the side choice and a glass of chianti. Ten minutes later i was called and told they did not serve the tomato soup any more and it should not have been on the menu. I was offered tortilla soup. Five minutes later called to be told they were out of tortilla soup (it was St Patrick's Day and they offered me Irish stew) - I chose the chicken soup. And yes, there was one more call. 15 minutes later I was called and told that I had an old menu and that they did not serve the chianti by the glass any more. Well, that was quite an experience. 4. Bell service - simply put, when they have a large convention, do not expect any bell service unless you are willing to wait 30-40 minutes for it. Enough said. I could go further but this is already too long. I stayed at the Fairmont for the rest of my stay. Thank goodness.

My only criticism is that some of the rooms are directly overlooked by neighbouring office blocks which make those rooms very dark and obviously no view whatsoever.

The purpose of our trip: two blowout dinners and some scintillating Chicago theater. We were fortunate (thanks to our Hyatt Diamond status) to be able to use one of our four confirmed suite upgrade certificates on this visit. Our West Tower junior suite (reportedly the biggest room on the 19th floor) overlooks the Chicago River, affording a view of the Marilyn Monroe statue and the gorgeous WGN and Wrigley Buildings. CHECK-IN: Cordial, helpful, and efficient. The fruit-infused drinking water is a refreshing touch. AMENITIES: Upon arrival, the room lacked robes, a corkscrew, and wine glasses. And oddly, there were no pens or paper, so the impulse to do some note-taking was hindered by a roomwide search. And finally, though the sleek, modern shower enclosure contains some nifty cubby holes for towels (meaning you don't have to open the shower door and reach to some distant towel rack) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly impossible to avoid getting yourself wet when reaching in to turn on the shower. We wish we hadn't been placed on a floor where the elevator landing was half blocked off for repairs. LOUNGE: The entrance opens into a smallish seating area and the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own concierge desk. The breakfast room feels cramped, and the sound from the single TV inhibits conversation. The selection of breakfast items is modest: mainstream yogurt (and some high-quality plain Greek yogurt), bagels (with an inviting array of capers, onions, and cured salmon), underripe melon, and a small selection of cereals. Nothing artisanal, but a decent selection if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not overly picky. (On the subject of melon: why do so many hotels in the north bother to serve it in winter? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive to truck in from a thousand miles away, and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ripen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in southern states and Mexico \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until at least late spring.) The coffee, from highly regarded Torrefazione, would have been brilliant if brewed strong, but it was watery and thin. Also on hand are several varieties of Tazo tea. Minor rant: We wish the hotel wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t electric-vacuum after breakfast, while the lounge, which is offered as a place for respite and relaxation. On our second morning, we arrived after breakfast, and while we appreciate the need to clean up, it was jarring to be taking our first cup of coffee while the staff was vacuuming (and pushing chairs) around us. Perhaps a silent push-broom vacuum would be fine. We urge management to hold off on loud vacuuming until after the lounge is closed each day. STAFF: Again, we found everyone to be efficient, friendly, and competent, from the front door to the front desk, and everywhere in between. We understand that this is a huge hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest in the Hyatt family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we wish housekeeping and room service would have been a little quicker to clean items left in the hallways by other guests. It seems like more than half a day went by before the unsightly pile of pizza boxes and beer bottles were cleaned from in front of a nearby room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the end of the world to have to sidestep such piles on the way to the elevator, but we think Hyatt would want to shore up that little service step, perhaps with periodic, regular rounds through the hallways with the express purpose of whisking away such unsightliness. THE BIG BAR: Mixed reviews. On one night, we stopped in for a nightcap, and we decided to go old school. We ordered a B-52, up, expecting a cocktail, shaken and strained, rather than on the rocks. What the bartender put in front of us was a room-temperature (\"warm\" would be a better way to describe it, since many of the bottles sit on lighted shelves) layering of the ingredients in a cordial glass. The concoction was sadly unappealing. Rather than remake it, our bartender just brought us some ice cubes to pour into the tiny glasses. That was a letdown. However, on our previous stay at the hotel (in mid January), the Big Bar staff went above and beyond. We ordered room service at 2:05 a.m., a mere five minutes after liquor laws kicked in that prohibited the kitchen from sending us up a bottle of wine. I hustled down to the Big Bar to order a bottle, but \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bound by the same laws \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they demurred. The manager, however, was thinking on his feet, and offered us a creative solution: we were invited to open the half bottle in our minibar that evening, and the staff would send up a bottle of our choice from the room service menu the next evening as a gesture of goodwill. Both bottles were comped, and without complication, which was further evidence that the notes made the previous night were handed on to the staff on duty the following day. That kind of creative thinking is exactly the kind of goodwill that would keep us coming back to the property on future stays. IN THE END: Despite the cumulative weight of all the little things that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite right [being located on a floor undergoing elevator maintenance; the lack of in-room amenities upon our arrival; strange sounds in plumbing near our room; the less-than-stellar soundproofing (being in a room with an adjoining door meant being able to hear the TV and conversations next door)], we were impressed with the overall courteousness of the staff, and of course we were pleased at how management stepped up to the plate on our behalf. [POSTSCRIPT: A further nod to management -- I mentioned the vacuuming, elevator, and Big Bar issues in an online survey Hyatt sent me after our stay was completed. I received a courteous e-mail reply within 24 hours from one of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managers, who agreed with our sentiments, said he would consider changing the vacuuming schedule, and asked how he could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make it right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for us on our next stay in Chicago.

On 2/24/12 we checked into the room a little after 9pm and every thing was fine until about 1:00 am when hotel security came to the room and said I HAVE TO BREAK MY PARTY UP because I cant have more than 4 people in my room after 10:00pm none of this was disclosed to me at any point in time.

Yes this is not a typo....So after all harrassment we received hotel security just wanted to come in and get a lap dance.If I would have known that I would have let them in for a while so they could have so fun to. so at this point Hotel security and the CPD got a free show from the strippers I paid for in the room I booked.And i was still kicked out the room at about 2:30am. I would not advise any young African Americans stay at this hotel because of stereotypes made against us and pure racism by their staff. One more thing I would like to add I called corporate and complained and some lady in charge of the rooms said that the Hyatt regency Chicago does not allow bachelor parties in their hotels not for blacks anyway and she said that I would not get any of my money back because they had tp pay other guest back because of the noise from my party.

It has consistently remained one of the better hotels on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe magnificent mile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in terms of value and the reliable quality of its accommodations. To this day, management has done a good job of sustaining its upkeep and modernizing its amenities. Despite its being a bit off of the shopping district (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll walk around \u00c2\u00bd of a mile to reach the Shops at North Bridge), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remained our first preference. The lobby is fantastically contemporary; albeit small and not well suited to large conventions (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to three separate conventions in this hotel, and despite adequate ballroom space, the arrangement of the lobby proved to be a hindrance). The steakhouse here, Stetson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, is very nice. The rooms are generous and aesthetically pleasing. The Chicago pedway (an underground, climate controlled network of tunnels and shops), which connects directly to the hotel, traverses the distance between many points of interest. There are multiple parking garages located within walking distance (some also connected to the hotel via the pedway). Unfortunately, there is a new aspect brewing in the underbelly of this fine hotel that, as far as I can see, defies logic. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to be bold, as well as presumptuous, and say that the hotel staff is harboring a distinct lack of pride in this establishment. On my most recent stay here, their service reeked of apathy. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see clumps of inexcusably overstaffed bellman and valet parkers, WITH their bell captains present, just standing around on downtime; refusing to greet guests, not even faking attempts to open doors for them, or directing traffic in a discernible manner. Good luck getting a bellman to help you with your luggage; I observed an old man being told to wait after asking for help directly from the bell captain, and when he received none from either of the three unoccupied bellmen he ended up lugging his bags in himself through a door that was held open for him (not by any of the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been bothered to work for a tip, let alone as a courtesy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but by another guest). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked at a medium-sized, family-owned hotel throughout my undergraduate degree, as a bellman and valet parker, and no matter how busy or understaffed we were we would make it a point to greet our guest warmly and without fail. We understood that the reception started and ended with us, and we had enough pride to make sure it was warm. Why that energy escapes the bellstaff here is beyond me, but I think the start of the solution is firing the bell captains point blank. Sadly, the less than mediocre service emanated in many other facets of this hotel on our most recent stay: everything was superficially cleaned by housekeeping, and you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to dig deep (or at all) to find the layers of dust, coffee was served cold to us at the small caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the 1st floor, one of the front desk staff was too impatient to help us resolve an issue we had. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real shame to have seen service so consistently bad (on this trip) for a hotel that has previously been so consistently good. I have no evidence to conclude that this is anything more than an exempt clause, so I do still recommend this hotel as a good option if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning a trip to Chicago downtown. In the meantime, I hope that the general manager is able to get to the root of the problem and come up with a way to re-inspire the staff.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old Forge, New York", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "Tekinidiver", "ReviewID": "UR124678929", "Content": "Great location, nicely appointed rooms and fabulous \"Big Bar\"", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSurprise for Jessy!\u201d", "Author": "Valdes63", "ReviewID": "UR124589968", "Content": "Excellent location and close to blue line.

I choose a room on a higher floor for $5 so the kids could enjoy the view. It was available and we were upgraded to a room on a higher floor for only $5 total (even though we had two rooms). Class act all the way. The check in and check out process was smooth. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. The rooms weren't large, but they were big enough and recently remodeled. Everyone was professional and helpful. The facilities were beautiful. As one of the kids put it when we pulled in, \"This place is FANCY!\".

And if I were staying here for a night or three, I'd give the Hyatt a solid 4 stars for comfort, staff and location, so that's what I'm going with -- what the average traveler might experience -- although I'll expand on longer stay dilemmas in the body of this review. The Hyatt automatically loses a point because there's really nothing \"extra\" in an average (non-suite) stay that might make a guest feel particularly wowed or welcomed. Here, I feel the Hyatt could take something from the Hilton or the Westin (free brewed coffee in the lobby, real cream instead of powdered in the room, warm bathrobes, etc. Sometimes one or two little things like this make quite a difference in perception.) The price of everything in the hotel is also quite high. For instance, it's $16 for a hamburger and fries. (If you want it delivered to your room, there's an additional 3.50 delivery charge, plus a 15% service/gratuity charge. With state and city taxes, that's over $23--for a burger). High prices may be okay for a weekend of planned splurging, but over the long-term, they can be daunting. There's no laundry room on site for guests and when I tallied the cost to use the Hyatt's laundry service for one load of clothes, it was $70. Ouch! On the positive side, the bed is very comfortable, the staff is friendly, and housekeeping does a good job. Towels, linens, accessible plug-ins and workspace were all appreciated. I give special kudos to Chris, a supervisor who did what he could to make my stay easier, including having a small refrigerator delivered to my room (normally $25/day) and comping the internet ($13.63/day). I think an important part of customer service is to leave people feeling like they were \"heard\" and Chris excelled in this. I was impressed. For those staying for more than a couple of days, I would recommend Bockwinkel's market, (a very short walk away) for simple food, beverage and sundries. GrubHub is an internet food delivery service for local restaurants and if you want to dine-in they'll deliver to the lobby and the prices are reasonable. In warmer weather, there are several other restaurants within walking distance and for espresso addicts like me, there's an excellent local coffee shop, Descartes, around the corner on Michigan. I called the very friendly @ChicagoCabbie (you can find them on Twitter) for a ride to the Sudz Laundry on Ashland. Twenty dollars there and back, plus 2.50 for a load of clothes (free drying!) still saved me about $50 over the cost of the Hyatt's laundry service. In short, I would recommend the Hyatt Regency for short stays.

It was our first time in Chicago, so we spent a lot of time researching hotels and eventually decided to stay there. Turned out to be a HUGE MISTAKE. During our last night there, I realized that a brand new dress I purchased during our trip was missing. I specifically remembered leaving it next to the desk in a shopping bag - but while packing up, I noticed the shopping bag and my dress were both gone. I called the front desk and the unapologetic woman on the line said she would report my missing item to the Lost and Found office and someone would call me back. Upon checking out the next morning, I inquired about the status of my missing dress, and they said the L/F office still had not gotten back to them. As soon as the plane touched down back home, I called the Hyatt Regency Chicago and asked them to transfer me directly to the L/F office. The man I spoke with told me there was no record of my lost dress, so I had to explain the situation and describe my dress for the third time. He said he would call me back with an update - which he never did. Surprise, surprise. I finally heard back from him a week later after I called multiple times and all he told me was, \"We didn't find it.\" No offer to continue to follow up, no offer to comp me with something (after all, it was a very expensive dress) - NOTHING. Fast forward to the present - my boyfriend and I are going back to Chicago this April for a wedding and we are definitely NOT even considering going back to the Hyatt Regency Chicago. For such a large hotel and an abundance of staff, not ONE PERSON took accountability for my dress disappearing from my hotel room. Such a shame.

This Hyatt is very nice, our room (a jr. suite actually) was extremely nice with an unbeatable view of the river and straight up Michigan Ave. I loved the chaise right in front of the floor length windows. Bathroom was marble, shower was walk-in and huge, white ginger amenities smelled like gardenia to me. As always, the \"Hyatt Bed\" was the greatest...I keep threatening to suck it up and buy one of their branded pillow-top mattresses. Can't say enough about how delightful the bed is. The workout facility was also quite nice, with more treadmills and ellipticals than some gyms, and a cooler of frosty towels. Check-in and out was speedy, and while we were offered help with our bags, we weren't pushed into it. (Sometimes the super-swank hotels get on my nerves with the all the people grabbing my luggage.) Lots of cabs available at all hours, although we wound up walking to and from both the nearby subway (state and lake i think) and our restaurants (naha and frontera grill). It was a short jog to fantastic Millineum park and equally fantastic Intelligensia for coffee. So...great location. All in all, i think we had the best of both worlds here...the conveniences of a large business/conference oriented hotel combined with the luxury and service of botique hotels (but without the high price).

It is the largest Hyatt Regency in the world but manages to personally interact with guests in a welcoming way that would be more expected from a much smaller establishment. There are a few negatives: the wooden corners of our bed were pointed and protruding, so my shins got dinged up every time I forgot to give them a wider berth; there were no toiletries in the room upon check-in, but that was quickly remedied by a phone call; there was no tub; the concierges don't seem to be able to magically get reservations at high-end restaurants the way concierges in other major cities often can; and you can't store items in the minifridge. That last issue is relevant because you will be bringing back leftovers from the incredible Giovanni's stuffed pizza place about 3 blocks away. (Do not miss this Chicago-style pizza!) Other positives: the view from the west tower toward the water is wonderful day & night, especially if you are lucky enough to wake up to a snowy morning. There were individual reading lights on the headboard. The shower was hot and had perfect pressure. The word of the week on Facebook will get you free internet, a reduced parking fee, and possibly also another surprise...be sure to visit this hotel on social media! There is a well-stocked grocery store just behind the hotel. I had drinks at the Irish pub and Big Bar on the premises; both were fine. The Art Institute is just a 15 minute walk away on Michigan Ave, as is the seasonal public ice skating rink. And the hotel is easy to reach on the blue line from ORD...just take it to the Clark/Lake station for $2.25 and walk approximately seven blocks east and one block north. One more thing...if you love the blues, I recommend both Buddy Guy's Legends and Kingston Mines. The latter has two stages with music until about 4 a.m., which made me aware of yet another hotel positive: it was quiet enough to sleep in late on Sunday morning. ;~D", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niles, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cOnly place to stay in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "Nancy H", "ReviewID": "UR121901395", "Content": "Love this hotel, centrally located, walking distance to Magnificent Mile, Theatre District, Milleneum Park, Navy Pier.

The bed and pillows were just ok, wasnt too pleased with that. Everything else we enjoyed. The hotel itself is off the mag mile, close to everything! Walking distance to Navy Pier, Lucky Strikes bowling and AMC theater, and tons of restaurants and shopping. We had a nice walk to Ruth's Chris steakhouse and Michael Jordans. If you are looking for food courts, head to the West tower and go to the bronze level(lower level). That is a pedway to the Illinois center next door, which has tons of restaurants in the adjacent building. Houlihans restaurant next door has a breakfast buffet I think every morning, so that can be an inexpensive way to get that start in the morning. On a nice day, the river walk across the street is a scenic view of the river and beautiful skyline. While you are on Michigan Ave take a pic with the huge Marilyn Monroe statue. Keep in mind, as with the rest of downtown, there is no parking(free anyway.) Either walking or taxi is your best option. Parking at Hyatt is $50 per nite, the other lot is $35 per nite. So get dropped off by a friend or take a taxi there, otherwise get ready to spend $$$$$ for parking. BTW, in the lobby of the east tower is J's express, which serves Starbucks coffee and other snacks and ice cream and open 24hrs.

Larry, who worked at the valet was great as was everyone else who took care of our parking needs for the week. Andy at the bell desk was awesome.

Check-in is at the 2nd/mezzanine floor via escalator ... with a very nice welcome, and warm smiles at the front desk. We stayed 2 different times at this hotel within a span of a week, so we gave it a good test-run. Both times requesting King size bed, getting 2 different views. We liked both rooms, each slightly different in set-up and views (see attached pics). The Good: As we said, warm welcome checking in each time, but maybe given we are Platinum members of their loyalty program (hopefully, true for all guests). We stayed in the \"West tower\" each time, which offered high-floor, wonderful views from our rooms... first stay was facing the river below, tour boats, the Navy Pier and Lake Michigan, and the second stay, faced North with beautiful views of the river below and Wrigley building & others, up Michigan Ave. Rooms were modern, simple, comfortable, and most importantly, very clean. One stay, we had a glass-enclosed walk-in shower, and the other stay was standard tub/shower. They arranged one room differently than other, but same basic amenities & furniture. Bathrooms were clean throughout our stay, which included basic toiletries. The rooms were uber-quiet, with no hint of neighbors (and we knew there were people next door, and on our floor). We did not try the restaurants or room service in the hotel, given so many options in Chicago. There is an ample fitness center, with all expected equipment, but no pool. Even with its size, the hotel was very comfortable and nice. Internet was included as complimentary, but if not loyalty member, chargeable. Service beyond the check-in was adequate, especially given the size of this hotel. The hotel is right off Michigan Ave, right by (2) bridges that cross over the Chicago River. It's very convenient to walk North to Michigan Ave shopping, or East toward Navy Pier, or South toward the wonderful Millennium Park (Bean sculpture), Art Institute of Chicago, though a maybe for some, a little far (for walking) for all the other museums (Field, Shedd, Adler, etc) clustered further South. We found it very, very convenient, as there are tons of buses on Michigan Ave to take you anywhere, the EL subway somewhat close also, and plenty of taxis if preferred. Park the car for this city ... unless going to further outreaches! The bad: it's a busy atrium, with busy entrance of taxis, cars, and people going in/out. This is normal for a large sized hotel like this one. Gratefully, the West tower where we were, has its own entrance, and sped us to our rooms without having to go through the main lobby, and a bridge that connects the East tower (where lobby is) to our West tower. Do expect conventions to occur during your visit. The hotel has large meeting rooms, banquet halls, and ballrooms, to accommodate many activities, so it could be busy with people, loud (with music), and cordoned off areas. It was not a big deal for us, as we did not encounter any problems. Summary: It's a good, large convention oriented hotel, but suitable for all kinds of visitors, families, couples, etc.. It is a very clean, efficient, comfortable, modern hotel, with enough warmth for those who travel enough and do not need full service/hand-holding by staff. They were fine. Stay in the West tower if possible, as it is closer to the river, and offers great views of the Lake and city.

The hotel is huge and a great spot for a conference. I've traveled to Chicago more times than I can count but this was my first time here. I'm not entirely sure I'd recommend it for family travelers or those not traveling for business to Chicago. Your feet will hurt just walking from one part of the hotel to the other! The conference rooms and exhibit areas were very large and modern; I will say that the layout is confusing despite the multiple signs and color coded levels at the hotel. I stayed in \"floating king\" room with a great view of the river and water. I highly recommend that room set up, because it is different and good use of the space. The room was small, but if you don't spend a ton of time in there, it shouldn't matter. I thought the layout was really cool and sort of unexpected; something different and fun for my stay here. I was on the 30th floor. We ate at the main restaurant and cafe twice and the buffet was good quality and lots of options. I liked the quesadillas very much. Big Bar upstairs was really loud and fun, everyone has a good time up there. Prices at both places are to be expected. The room service for breakfast was very very expensive. I had toast, fruit and coffee and it was $30. Recommend eating downstairs and grabbing a quick bit of fruit, Starbucks, and something else to save some cash. Location is good but not next to 'everything' - you are within walking distance of Milennium Park and a bit farther to Michigan Avenue shopping. Otherwise a $6 cabride to the shops. The river area is really cool to be near, and views of the cool architecture was nice to have as well. I've said it is more of a business location versus vacation location for that reason. I'd recommended going closer to the shopping and train lines if you're coming to Chicago on vacation. I think the closest train stop was Lake/Clark and it was about 1-mile. So I took the El from O'Hare and then taxi to the hotel (total cost $8). All of the people I came in touch with - room service, wait staff, concierge, check-in desk, folks answering the phone, etc - were very professional and helpful. I did not have a bad experience at any staff. Only other Chicago tip I can share: beware of the cab drivers and ask before you climb inside the car whether they take credit cards. We had a ton of weird and unfortunate experiences with the drivers who would only take cash EVEN THOUGH it is passengers' rights and city law that they take credit cards.

Food was good, hash browns a bit heavy, but I could have left some on the plate. Prices are a little steep, but we found that all over Chicago. 151 has a beautiful sun filled atrium atmosphere that is excellent for a morning meal. There is a Starbucks in the lobby as well a small, expensive snack stand. Our room was beautiful, clean and the beds comfortable. A plus included internet in our room with no additional charges. Nice and roomy bathroom stocked with \"white ginger\" based products - they were good, but a bit too clashy with any other scent you may be applying.

The doormen greet you, the bellmen are right there, the front desk personnel are efficient, patient and cheerful, the concierge folks knew the neighborhood and assisted with some decisions. The Hyatt people all seemed to be happy to be at work. This hotel has a lot of rooms. When the meeting ended for the day, there was an elevator traffic jam for the six East Tower cars going up the 28+ floors. I don't know if the West Tower has similar log jams. Hyatt employees were managing the hordes during the times when the elevator traffic jams were occurring. [Truly appreciated] It is a bit confusing that the registration is on the 2nd floor - but you only have to register once. The room was comfortable and quiet. I slept well. I didn't have any complaints about the beds - colleagues in other rooms on other floors found the beds too soft and some with squeaks. Lots of pillows per bed. The desk, television and modern easy chair were all fine. There really wasn't a water view from the 28th floor. The Lake is blocked by the other high rises and the river is just north, but below street level. However, depending on what side of the building you are on - you can see some famous Chicago building tops. I ate at Daddyo's [late night dessert] and at Bistro 151 [lunch]. The food was good and the prices reasonable for hotel based restaurants. The service in Daddyo's was very good but the service at Bistro 151 was indifferent. However, if you go down to the Bronze level and head west out of the West Tower, you will find an underground food court that includes a grocery store, dentist and bank. The usual fast food suspects and other options for grab and go or sit down for those meals you don't want to spend too much money on or need to overeat due to huge portions. Venture south past the fast food places and you can get to a real restaurant without going out in the cold. I've been in this hotel a few times before - always for professional or work related meetings. The underground convention center is under both towers, 2 floors deep and quite expansive. It takes about a day to maintain orientation between towers, level colors and the names of the meeting rooms and ballrooms. The fitness center is also underground and tucked away. If the weather is acceptable, you can get a fine workout walking or running to the museums, the Miracle Mile, or along the Lake front. You can pay to go to the next door athletic center that has a pool and classes. Don't put anything in the not a refrigerator refrigerator. The hot beverage maker is just fine for a tea drinker [coffee is also provided]. So, this was a fine hotel.

However I stayed here in November and have stayed here at least 20 times in the past 4-5 years. To start out, this is not my favorite hotel in Chicago. That said, the Hyatt can be a great experience. It starts with check-in. I have had the standard room where I thought I was in a 3 star hotel wannabe. I have also stayed in a Jr. Suite. Do your best to inquire at the desk and demand a clean room and a quiet floor. Next is your dining experience. The big bar, if you are alone, is just not that comfortable. Stetsons is a steakhouse and is OK. remember this is Chicago and there are at least 7 prime steakhouses within a 10.00 cab ride. If you want quiet, a drink and comfort without leaving the hotel your only real choice is stetsons, your room or DaddyO's pub. If you feel like walking for 5 minutes I recommend the Palm restaurant next door and also the South Water Kitchen on Water street. If you walk there in the winter, be sure to go out the west tower entrance. Both locations handle single patrons just fine There is always foot traffic and hustle/bustle in and around the Hyatt and towards Michigan avenue even at night. So if it is a nice Winter night and you feel like a walk it is safe. Usually you will see others walking the same direction. That is one of the charms of downtown Chicago for a single traveler. Also, cabs are cheap in Chicago. You can go from the Hyatt to the Water Tower place on North Michigan ave for shopping/dining for 7.00 with tip. Then walk back down Michigan ave and stop in all the shops. My only suggestion back at the Hyatt is they need to add a smaller more intimate bar area serving small plates or extensive appetizers and cater more to the single traveler. This is why I gravitate to the smaller boutique type hotels. That said, if you are booked at the Hyatt, enjoy yourself and by all means get out and enjoy downtown Chicago.

Check in was fast using the new quick check in kiosks. I never spoke to a front desk person. The service throughout my stay was excellent from the staff helping with the conference (very helpful and friendly) to the room service people who brought things right on time. The room was average. Unfortunately my positive experience was offset when I checked out via the quick check out kiosks and discovered in the cab ride on the way to the airport that I had been charged two different \"eStandby Guestroom upgrade\" fees for each day I stayed there. I was completely puzzled by this so when I returned home I called the billing questions number listed on the Hyatt website. I was connected to an agent who explained that these charges were for the \"cozy room\" upgrades- one daily charge was for the \"free\" movie and the other was for a higher floor (I was on floor 15 which in my opinion is not an upper floor given that the hotel has 36 floors). I explained had never requested or approved any upgrade to my room, that I had booked the room for a conference, and checked in by kiosk. The agent asked me to hold while she contacted the front desk in Chicago. She came back on the line and said she spoke to a person named Chris who said that I had approved these charges at check in. First of all, I never met someone named Chris and its ridiculous that he would remember me any way so I was a little peeved that the implication from the agent was that this person clearly remembered me approving the charges, I never spoke to a human being at the front desk. I informed her that this was incorrect and that Id like the charges removed to which she replied that she would have to initiate a request to the \"controller\" to see if they would remove the charges and that this process can take up to two weeks. She kindly informed me that there was no guarentee that the charges would be removed. At this point I was quite unhappy since I never approved the charges, never spoke with someone who even asked if I wanted these upgrades, and needed to submit my receipt to my company to be reimbursed. I indicated that this was unacceptable and she will need to connect me to a supervisor. After a VERY long hold time, she came back on the line and indicated she had spoken to her supervisor and whe would remove the charges. Anyway, it was resolved but the whole experience left me wondering how many guests dont question these kind of charges.

A pumpkin-carving contest was an added, fun component to the campaign and I represented DFW in the carving of my pumpkin. The Media Relations team led by Jennifer Kedinger, made all of the contestants feel comfortable and relaxed by their attentiveness, generosity, and attention to detail. Everyone we met from the Hyatt provided excellent service. The facility was very nice, including the Bar on the second level which was fabulous with a great view of the city and impeccable service. The location is excellent in walking to the Loop or the Magnificent Mile.

I was there with my boyfriend on vacation for the weekend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary together. It was his first time to Chicago and I had been there multiple times before. I gave a 4 star rating mainly for the staff and location of this hotel. The location can't be beat with some of the most spectacular views of the river and lake. We could see the draw bridge going up with the sailboats coming in for Winter storage. Navy Pier is also visible. We were in the West Tower on the 31st floor in room 3114 a deluxe King Room. Very simple clean room with the floating king bed and a desk area with a great bathroom. Some of the cons were thin walls, you could hear people in rooms next door, no tub in the bathroom and I didn't like the bed it was a little firm, but that is a personal preference my boyfriend likes a firm bed and he didn't have a problem with it. Things to take note. This Hotel is HUGE, multiple towers with 36 floors in all towers. It is a haven for conventions,weddings and other celebrations. It was a weekend and it was really busy. The elevators were not a problem for us but at peek times expect a little bit of a wait, really people just be patient! The location can't be beat, its close to everything. Walking distance to the river front, Chicago cultural center, Michigan Ave, Millennium Park, Marilyn Monroe, and much more! we didn't eat at any of the restaurants or bars because there are simply so many other options for value around the Hotel and we didn't come to Chicago to hang out at the Hotel, we wanted to explore the city. The staff was just great! Like mentioned before friend them on Facebook and they will give you great upgrades and little surprises. Ours was Champagne and Chocolate covered Strawberries upon return on our first night, with a note telling us Happy Anniversary and to enjoy our stay. It was a pleasant surprise and after a long day of driving, a warranted surprise at that! The only con we had was upon checking out, being a busy Hotel they were swamped at valet parking and we had to drag our luggage down to the level of parking underneath and wait over a half an hour for our car. This was not a pleasant experience. Overall, I do understand and was patient but it was a lot of people with luggage and you had no place to wait and inhaling exhaust fumes for a half an hour was not pleasant. It was just simply really busy, I don't know what else they could have done. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay to explore the city. Upon our return we would stay here again.

We did manage to use our government or state-rate affiliation to get the room for half of what everyone else was paying. Normally an average room in a 4 star hotel downtown Chicago will be less than $200. The hotel sits right on the river and acquiring an upper floor room provides exceptional views of the city and the river. The hotel is within walking distance of Michigan Ave. and the magnificent mile. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Big Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the hotel is big... and pricey\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 paid $28.00 for two long-island-iced teas and they were in 8 ounce glasses at that. WOW!. Should have just sprung for the Big Margarita for two (actually big enough for four) for the same price. When they say big, they mean big! I hate the rip of for the $50 parking. There are public garages within walking distance to the hotel and if you are not there with a bunch of kids and luggage, you can park next door at 111 Wacker where there is a public parking garage for $35.00. I used the hotel parking because the wife is a wimp but made them go and get my car three or four times while there that one day to try and get my money's worth. But the whole thing is a ripe off as far as forcing clients to use their valet parking when you pull up to the entrance. But their staff are extremely nice and friendly. Every single one of them went out of their way to be nice to us. When in the bar which gets really crowded at night, one of the floor managers came up to my wife and I at the bar where we were trying to get a drink to take back to the room but the tenders were really busy and weren't noticing us. He intervened and got the bartender's attention and ordered for us....\"good looking out!\" While you are there, walk down Michigan to the Grand Lux for a meal and then hit the stores. The newly decorated rooms reminded me of the d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel line. They have incorporated modern, subdued color schemes, with interesting textures and wall treatments. We had started seeking accommodations in other newer hotels because they were showing signs of aging. Now, we will have to start going back to our old (new) spot for experiencing Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings. And, man, they have a lot to offer. You have to try Zed451 at 739 N. Clark. Brazilian style offering in a really nice setting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Excellent food and staff. Valet parking was only $12.00. Normally anywhere you go they charge you $17 to $18 in a parking lot downtown for just an hour. This felt like a bargain. I am from Springfield, Illinois the land of Lincoln. Parking is free after 4:00pm and free all weekend. So, it is a shock to pay for every little bitty thing when you go to Chicago. There are more and more experienced beggars positioned on the streets... some with signs others just with props like one who used a young sad-faced child in tow asking for something, anything to help.

I had a great stay at this hotel! I joined the facebook page before I went, and was able to get answers to so many questions I had before even coming to Chicago. That was a big plus for me. When we arrived, we were able to check in WAY before we were supposed to (our flight arrived at 945am and we got there around 1030). Jordy was the guy who was at the desk, and he seemed very pleased to be able to offer us an early check in. The room was very nice, and very clean. The view wasn't the best, but we could see a sliver of the lake from our window. It wasn't a big deal because we didn't really come to Chicago to look out a window anyway. So after we checked in, we headed out the the aquarium... After a long day of flying and exploring we came back to our hotel room to find some Chicago style toffee that had been sent to us from the social media manager. I thought that was a really nice touch, really classy, it had me smiling for the rest of the trip. The bed was the best i've ever slept on, and those blackout shades will ensure you don't wake up before you have to. It is true what people have said about the television stations available being not so great, but again... why go on vacation to watch tv? I would also like to say that, yes, the internet is outrageously priced per day. We thought we wouldn't have a need to use it, but we were wrong, and it ended up being a small annoyance (until we found other solutions)... you can join the facebook group, and give them the word of the week at check in for a free day, or if you have an iphone, just go to starbucks and use the free wifi there. $14 for internet is only expensive for average vacationers here on a deal... I don't think the business types worry about it, and therefor think that while it seemed outrageous to me, it might not to others. The housekeeping staff was great, we were only woken up by them once on our trip (check out day) but that was fine. This hotel is close to everything. you can walk, transit, cab, bike... whatever... to anywhere from here. On our check out, we noticed we were charged for some long distance phone calls which we didn't make... We went to the desk, and it was Jordy again. Let me tell you, this guy is so great! He looked into it for us, and realized there was a guest staying on our floor with an almost identical name. So, he RIPPED the bill to shreds and printed us a new copy with a nice ZERO on it. I thought it would also be important to note that although you may have to check out before your flight leaves, you're not comitted to carrying around your luggage for hours... you can leave it with the bell desk!

It was an okay stay: The room/bathroom was very clean and modern looking, and the staff was very friendly. However, the hotel has quite a few flaws: 1. The Internet situation here is awful. $14 per day for wireless access? That's such a rip off, and put a really bad taste in my mouth. This hotel, it seemed, catered to a lot of business people. Wifi should be free and accessible to every guest staying at the hotel. We didn't pay for the Internet because of the price out of principle. 2. The TV channels sucked. We had better channels and options on our TV when we stayed in Mexico. There were only a handful of channels, and the remote looked like it was from the 80s. 3. Walls were pretty thin - you could hear a lot of noise outside your door when guests walked by. 4. I booked through Priceline, and a week before our stay, I called to ask when I could request early check-in/late check-out/King size bed and a possible upgrade (it was my husband's birthday). I know when you book through Priceline, you can't expect any of these things. We were able to check in around 1:45 p.m., and I got a late check out of 1 p.m. but they couldn't get a King-sized bed even though I requested one (two double beds for a romantic birthday weekend kind of sucked) and they didn't offer anything for our special occasion. I thought maybe vouchers for a free drink at the bar or something would have been appreciated. Oh well.* *Again, I know these things shouldn't be expected, but usually more upscale hotels (not even just those sometimes) will try to do something to make your stay more special for an occasion you're celebrating). Overall, I'd recommend the hotel for people looking for a basic, clean conveniently-located hotel when you plan not to spend a lot of time in the room.

Great location if you want to experience shopping, dining, and night life. Was a little shocked that hotel parking was an additional $50 per night. I couldn't find this info when we booked online. Next time will do more research to see if cheaper parking nearby, or pick a hotel with parking included. Also - be prepared, drinks & food are very expensive downtown.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201c\"Liked Hotel a Lot\"\u201d", "Author": "Traveling_Lady_2004", "ReviewID": "UR118691725", "Content": "Stayed at the Hyatt for business.

The rooms seem to have been recently remodeled. They have a very modern look and clean lines, with an earth-tone color scheme. No hideous floral bedspreads, carpet or curtains! The linens are nice, crisp and white, and they use duvets. I've eaten breakfast at the BISTRO at 151, had drinks at the BAR at 151, and I've had room service. All the food and drinks were just fine and reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet at the bistro is an excellent value -- loads of choices (many with a European flair), and all yummy. Even the minibar items are reasonably priced! The location can't be beat. You're a five minute walk from Millennium Park, Michigan Avenue shopping, Navy Pier, the boat tours, the theaters and more. Although the hotel has a fitness center, I got up early and ran around downtown, because the hotel was so close to so many attractions. It was a great way to see the sights without battling the crowds! And it's also convenient to many of the big office buildings and business-related destinations. My favorite part, though, is the service. This hotel is huge, with tons of convention space. Despite this, I felt like I was one of the only guests there. Service was prompt, and I never waited in a line or waited too long for room service or an elevator (my pet peeve). Every single staff member was friendly and smiling. They always offered a warm greeting, from the person who checked me in to the housekeepers in the hallways. And any time I needed someone, they were handy, whether I needed unexpected help with a bag, or a taxi, or help selecting a souvenir in the gift shop. I was not expecting this level of service from a large chain property. Some things to note: Public areas can get very crowded when there are lots of conventions, which may be a bit annoying to some. Not all rooms have a great view. Some look out to adjacent office buildings. But some have fantastic views of the river/lake. If a view is important to you, note this when booking. Likewise, some rooms are noisier than others. My first room was soundproof, but on my second stay, I had a connector room, and I could hear my neighbors at times. And of course, they charge for internet use. I know to expect that from this type of hotel, but I wish the industry as a whole would get over it and start offering complimentary wi-fi.

I would recommend avoiding these rooms (corner ones with queen bed) unless noise isn't a problem to you! My other comment on this hotel is probably general to a lot of hotels in Chicago- it is huge beyond belief!! The hotel foyer reminded me of a train station and was often very busy and congested with several conferences taking place in the hotel. Also, despite the notice in the room saying towels would only be changed at the end of the stay unless you request otherwise, my towels were changed daily- a massive environmental waste in my opinion!

For example, the bathroom sink was incredibly small and shallow. More the size of a sink in an RV than a full bathroom. Instead of installing ADA-compliant towel racks, there were simply no towels in the bathroom. It really was unpleasant to step out of the shower and realize that you have to walk out into the bedroom and into the closet to get a bath towel.

Overall, a good experience. But, my preference for smaller, less expensive hotels definitely colored the view of my stay here. The pros: - Excellent customer service. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect knowing the staff was on strike. ALL of the staff were extremely courteous and helpful, from the front desk to the coffee shop to the housekeeping. Please remember to tip the maids, bell boys, and others. Doesn't sound like Hyatt employees are treated very well. - Comfortable beds. You can just sink into the mattress and rest peacefully. Pillows could use an upgrade. - Fairly quiet. I didn't hear anyone's TV, the elevator, or anything like that. Occasionally I thought I heard someone dropping something in their bathroom, but who knows what that was. - Location. Close to several restaurants, bars, and shopping. I highly recommend walking 1/2 block down Stetson St. (in between the towers) to Bowinkles(?), a deli with reasonably priced made-to-order sandwiches, baked goods, sodas, coffee, and a full grocery (also sells wine and beer). The Cons: - Expensive. Everything from the coffee shop to using a refrigerator, it's pricey. I would much prefer to stay in a hotel with free wireless, a refrigerator for your use, somewhat drinkable in room coffee, and a simple TV channel guide. The room feels like a set-up- every time you turn on the TV, look at the fridge, open your computer- they are trying to get your money. Wireless was free with the conference hotel rate but still... A coffee and fruit cup costs $9 at J's express. - No pool. Not sure how a pricey, massive place like this could not have a pool, but they don't, and they should. - Employees on strike. Just not a good feeling knowing you're supporting a corporation that treats its employees like second class citizens. I only stayed here because I generally like staying at the conference hotel (you can go rest when there's a short break), and I wanted to support my professional organization. Now I see there are plenty of cheaper options a hop skip and jump away. Try the Club Quarter, Hotel Monaco (where there's a free happy hour!), or one of the many other hotels within a 4 block radius.

In any city hotel, I always expect a small room and am happy if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anything larger than tiny. My room in the East Tower, however, was generously sized with a king bed, long desk unit holding a flat-screen TV, two (sort of) comfortable easy chairs, and a small table--and still plenty of open space! The room faced north with a nice view of the river. Desk space was plentiful and allowed me to spread my work out. Internet was free (a charge showed when I connected each day, but the staff said it would be credited on the bill and it was), though the connection was slow. There were plenty of power outlets, but I wish the ones at the bedside were easier to access. Drawer space was very limited and probably would be insufficient for two persons who prefer to unpack their suitcases. Reading light was good at the desk, chairs, and bed. The mattress sagged in several spots and it was a bit difficult to get comfortable. The bathroom was also a good size, but with minimal counter space and only two hooks (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to reuse my towel, but never know what to do with it nor how it will dry between uses). Water pressure was acceptable and the hot water was steady. The room was clean upon arrival, and housekeeping did a good job each day. The only major concern I had with the room was noise. I could hear some street noise from the exterior, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. It was the noise from the interior hallways that awakened me many times during my first two nights. After that, I wised up and used earplugs so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if the noisiness those first nights was largely a weekend phenomenon or if it continued on weekdays. I do know that the sound-proofing of the interior corridors is poor. The staff were generally pleasant and helpful. Check-in and check-out were uneventful. I had a minor concern about the luggage storage process. Huge amounts of luggage were stored (in a cordoned-off area of a corridor), but there was only one worker at this station even though a) a large conference seemed to be ending (with many folks therefore retrieving luggage at the same time), and b) several bellmen were milling around nearby. It was very slow. The public areas of the hotel are fine though rather noisy. Elevators are numerous, but sometimes, the wait was long. The location of the Hyatt is great, right by the river, the Magnificent Mile, and Millennium Park. Restaurant choices are almost endless. I found it convenient to take the CTA from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare and then a taxi from Clark/Lake station to the hotel, but the walk from the station is not far (just too far for me with luggage!).

My sense too is that she is wonderful on her own and wonderful as a result of a good service attitude at the Hotel.

It mattered. One of the doormen remembered me each day and knew what kind (non-smoking, air conditioned, non-van) cab I wanted. I noticed this with many staff who remembered guests. That takes a positive attitude and good training. Special praise to the housekeepers who were so pleasant and welcoming. It's the toughest job in the hotel; remember to tip daily! - room service breakfast - timely and good. The fresh fruit was really that! Things on which they can improve: - Free wifi would be really nice. - Package intake and shipping are costly just for handling and the process, because it's outsourced, is annoying. (I pre-print my own labels; I still had to deal w/ this.) - Ramp access to the Bistro from the elevator side. One has to walk all the way around the area to get to the ramp. Seems an easy fix. - See above \"likes\" re unscented bathroom products. - Better bedside lighting needed. There is a 'reading light' but the height of it is not great for reading in bed.

We are from Iowa so we don't know much about the hotels in the area and didn't want to be stuck in a hotel we didn't like for more than one night. But we found ourselves wishing we could stay longer! We got a room discounted on Expedia and paid 20 dollars to upgrade to a river-view room on the 19th floor. It was absolutely beautiful, especially at night. If you do stay in this hotel and they offer to upgrade you to a room with a view, it is worth the 20 bucks. There was a lot of people and boat watching from our room alone, and at night there was a fireworks display we could see perfectly from our room. It is also very close to lots of shops and places to eat, as well as a grocery store right next to the steakhouse. Since hotel food is so pricey we just walked to the store and brought back snacks and drinks for the night. This is a great hotel if you just want to explore the streets of Chicago, we actually skipped a trip to the zoo so we could just walk around. Now for the downsides. The parking is so expensive, it is 50 bucks. When I called they stated they had self-parking, but it took us over an hour to even find the hotel, and we had no idea where the self-parking was. When we pulled into the service entrance we didn't even know where the front entrance was so we just ended up having to pay for valet parking, which we didn't even use since we walked everywhere. My advice is to call and get directions, because I had them all written down from Google Maps, but they were useless due to construction. We also tried using our gps on our phones, but because of the tall buildings it did not work right. So if you get lost call and the staff will give you good directions.

When we arrived at the hotel, we checked in at the Gold Passport desk and really felt as though they went out of their way to get us excited about our stay. We were in a junior suite on the 30th floor with a great view of the river and the city. The view of the city lights at night was just breathtaking! The room was well-appointed, with a sitting area with a coffee table, two couches, and a few end tables. Behind that was a desk. The other end of the room had the bed, night stands, etc. The bathroom was standard, and we thought the shower was a bit small, but definitely worked for us. In the entryway to our room was a nice \"prep\" area with a mini fridge and a counter-top, perfect for those on more than a 1-2 night stay. The only negative was that we could very clearly hear the party people in the room next door, but they must have spent most of their time out of the room, because it only woke us up once in the middle of the night. We ate both at in-room dining an at Daddy-O's, the \"Irish Pub\" on-site. Room service was very prompt, especially considering that the hotel was at capacity, no small feat for the largest Hyatt in the world! The food was good - burgers were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. Daddy-O's has a pretty decent selection of beers on draft and in bottles, and the food we tried was good and reasonably priced for hotel bar food. Since this hotel was recently renovated, everything was clean and modern. We really liked the decor and the sleek lines of the furniture and the artwork on the walls. Thumbs up to the designer! The one thing, though, that we couldn't get over was how friendly and helpful the staff were. We had some contact with Jenn K. from the hotel prior to our trip, and she went out of her way to make sure that it was amazing (we were also celebrating our 8th anniversary). The front desk representative who checked us in made us feel special and took her time with us despite the fact that there was a line in the lobby for check-in. We never felt rushed, and the concierge/front desk staff were always positive, nice, and completely accommodating every time we called or stopped down. This is a HUGE hotel, so if you're not into walking, it may not be the best for you. The elevators, though, are quick and plentiful. The gym was also much larger than many I've seen, and I had no problem using a treadmill in the morning even though the hotel was full. The hotel is also connected to shopping by underground pedways, which really came in handy during some of the crazy rainstorms we had! Overall, we had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The rooms are nice and newly renovated, there are several dining options on-site and hundreds more in the general area, it's within walking distance to almost everything you'd want to do or see in downtown Chicago, and the staff are ultra-friendly and accommodating.

This facility, conveniently located just east of Michigan Avenue on Whacker, appears to do a high volume of conference business, but the staff is obviously well-trained and highly efficient. The level of customer service, from check-in to the bell stand to housekeeping, more than met the needs of a steady stream of visitors. Conference visitors congregating in the lobby area seemed focused on accomplishing business rather than worried about ancillary details. I didn't spot one disgruntled customer during our three days in the hotel. I had no problem getting an early check-in, and in fact, was switched into an exceptionally nice room to accommodate my request. Our view on the 27th floor included the river and Navy Pier. The large bathroom was very clean (and I'm picky about that) and included high quality toiletries. This is a full service facility with a well equipped gym (and many other services including on-site tailoring) and multiple restaurants. We found members of the staff to be pleasant and eager to help throughout our stay, whether they were behind a desk or riding an elevator with us. We were asked often if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our stay. Refreshing! I'd like to highlight the bell stand tasked with the hefty job of storing what looked to be truckloads of luggage. Their system seemed to work well, and we really appreciated being able to safely store our baggage -which left us free to explore the city both before our check-in and after our check-out.

To be perfectly honest, I thought the Hyatt, while very nice, was just ok for me and I probably would not stay there again unless I snagged a fantastic rate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very large hotel (with 2 separated wings) more suited for conventions/business than for leisure travelers although that should not deter you from booking if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying for vacation, as the hotel is in a great location to Millennium Park, Navy Pier, theater district, etc. The hotel graciously put us on the very top floor, I suspect they did so since it was our anniversary during our stay and they upgraded us. However, the room did not have much of a view, so unless you are going to be guaranteed a great view, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother paying extra money for the higher floor. This can be an issue if the hotel is crowded with a convention, as the wait for the elevators can be a real drag. Also, the room is decorated with lots of rich browns and chrome which was nice by design but way too dark for my tastes. By comparison, we stayed at the Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel next door on a previous trip, and our room was far brighter and felt much more expansive (and we had a much better view). Another plus for the Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel is that they offered dispensers of ice cold water or lemonade in the lobby (I think coffee in the morning too) which was a small but very nice and hospitable touch. There is a Corner Bakery caf\u00c3\u00a9 within a few minutes walking distance and a small grocery store literally footsteps away (if you are taking side entrance). As I was traveling w/my family, it was far less expensive to eat out for breakfast rather than at the hotel. The hotel concierge recommended Emerald Loop which was less than a 10 min walk as well and we enjoyed that as well. The hotel offers a coupon there for a free appetizer which conveniently served as a kids meal for my son.

Getting to the hotel lobby/check in desk from the adjacent parking garage was a little confusing as we had followed the signs to the \"Hyatt\" but arrived at the convention center side of the Hyatt...not realising this wasn't where we were meant to be! However we managed to find a member of staff who was going towards the front lobby who showed us the way, which was great. At check in we were assisted by a member of staff called Avi. He gave us a truly fantastic room on the 24th floor with the most amazing view I've ever seen from a city hotel. We could see the river, the Hancock Tower, the Tribune Tower and the Wriggly Building to mention but a few things, without leaving our room! It was a complete \"pinch me\" feeling waking up in our room each day and returning to it each evening because the view was amazing. The room was huge! It may have been a suite...not that we'd booked one. The trade off was that we were on a Murphy bed but that was just as comfortable as a \"normal\" bed so wasn't an issue for us at all. Avi, if you ever read this, thank you so much! :-) Now for the negatives such as they are. There was a dental conference at the hotel whilst we were there and on our first night there we encountered so many drunk people walking around...spilling drinks that we began to wonder if we'd made a huge mistake by booking here. The elevators took a tad longer than normal due to the high volume of use but nothing to cause us too much of an inconvenience really. The negative which bothered me the most was that room service never came on our first full day there (we'd checked in the previous night) and I'm not sure they'd have come the following day either, if we hadn't sought them out on our way to the elevators and requested that they stopped by our room to change the sheets and towels. We got back to our hotel at the end of the day and noted that they had been but I was upset that out of the 3 bath towels they'd left for us, one had a huge hole in it and the other had a nasty looking stain on it. As it was our last night, I didn't want to complain or get the room service staff in trouble but it did upset me a little. Other than the above negatives, it was an absolutely amazing stay and I'd definitely stay there again. The view and size of our room was something I guess you'd have to see, to believe! :-) The location was amazing and I felt perfectly safe returning to our hotel on foot late into the evening too.

Quick walking access to both Millennium Park (and things south of the River) and the Magnificent Mile (and things north of the River). The view from our 24th floor room was beautiful as we could see the other buildings, the river, Navy Pier, and the lake. Absolutely beautiful at night. - Check-in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Check-in was quick and easy, even though there was apparently a problem with our reservation. Con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: - Getting Around\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6At the risk of making myself sound like an idiot, we had a hard time understanding the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the hotel, even with the map provided after asking. Trying to get to the 111 Wacker Dr. self park parking garage from inside the Hyatt was downright comical (I guess you just had to be there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6felt a bit like the Grisswold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from the Vacation movies). This all could have been taken care of if we would have just paid for the Hyatt to park us, but we were wanting to save money. - Cleanliness\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6as soon as I walked into the room, there was a plastic cable tie laying on the floor. Odd thing to find on a hotel floor, especially given that it was so noticeable (I would have thought a cleaner would have noticed for sure). The carpet was nice, just littered with fuzz and noticeable items (a quick hit with the vacuum would have cleared it all up). There was food, yes, food, slapped onto the wall between the TV and the full length mirror (at least 5 spots). We did call about this item, asking if it could be cleaned while we went out to dinner. By the time we returned, it was spotless\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but how did the staff miss food slapped on the wall? The bathroom was spotless, and the beds were fine. We needed a few more towels, so we called down and asked for a few more, including a foot towel for the shower. We were told that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have foot towels. Odd, but ok\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we could deal with that. The next day though (Saturday), a foot towel appeared after the room was cleaned. There was another one of those plastic cable tie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the cabinet below the TV, locking the two cabinet doors together. I found this strange, so I pulled the door open far enough to see what was in there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6snacks? A Refrigerator? At least that is what it looked like. Was there a reason this was cabled off? If so, that was odd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they want us to purchase these items? If there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a reason, is it not odd that when the room was cleaned Friday or Saturday, the cleaning staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it and cut it off or whatever? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure we would have purchased from it anyhow, but made for an oddity in the room. In conclusion, I cannot get past the cleanliness thing. We have stayed at other Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and have not had like issues with cleanliness. I can put up with a lot, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put up with a dirty room.

We used Priceline and got the Hyatt for just over $90. For this price we thought this hotel was excellent. As most of the prior reviews have said this is a large hotel that has a lot of conventions so it can be quite busy in the lobby areas at times. We only had experience at the front desk but it looked like there were always hotel people around to help. The first day or two there was a dental convention there which did cause a small issue for us (which I will mention later) but for the most part was not a problem. Front Desk - we arrived around noon or so on Thur and there were several people working. We were able to walk right up and checked-in. The young women working the desk was very personable. I always forget to request a King bed, and hotels rarely seem to ask a preference, but she did ask to my surprise. We told her we would prefer a King and she said he had a King near the elevator or she had 2 queens. We thought a second and said we'll take the King and after looking in her computer again she said she had another King room open up away from the elevator that we gladly took. You could also check-in using airport-like kiosks too but I wasn't sure what the bed request situation would have been so we opted for a live person. Room: Our room was on the 33rd floor which was the \"Board of Directors\" floor. I am not sure what the difference was from the other floors since our friends had one of the top floors too, but in the West tower, and from their description of their room it seemed to be identical. The room was modern, very nicely decorated, a decent size, and spotless. You could tell they were recently updated and I could find no show of wear anywhere. The King bed was located in the middle of the room which was different but worked. The head of the bed was toward the window and the foot of the bed was toward the TV. Just on the other side of the head of the bed was a large desk and floor to ceiling window. The view was nothing special, it just looked out on another apartment/condo. The TV was a flatscreen but the TV reception was lousy, however, I have found this to be a problem at a couple hotels I have stayed at lately. Hopefully one day hotels will upgrade to HD service instead of sticking with whatever they had before they got flatsceens. The air conditioning worked very well and was extremely quiet except for a short hiss every so often. It sounded liked it was venting or something but other than that you would barely know when it was on. The bathroom was equally as nice, modern, and spotless. A couple of other nice touches were individual reading lights attached to the headboard, iPod dock alarm clock, and the provided travel size toothpaste. Elevator: This was our biggest \"issue\" with this hotel. There were 6 elevators and depending on the day and, if there is a convention, the elevator could take forever or filled up quickly. We were coming down at one point and it stopped about 10 times and was filled by about the third stop. We also waited for it on the second floor (front desk level) and the elevator went from floor 1 to 9 without stopping at 2. We saw this happen a couple times at that particular time. While this wasn't a huge issue it was annoying at times. When the convention people left on Friday we only had it happened once, maybe twice, and our friends in the other building said they never had an issue. Location: The location was very good but we did find ourself doing a lot of walking (which wasn't really a bad thing with all the good food Chicago as to offer but it was also really hot) We spent most of our time on the other side of the river on Michigan Ave and each day we found ourselves up near E. Ontario, Grand, or State St for one thing or another. These streets were about 5-6 blocks just to get to them and then most things we went to were several streets down. Millennium Park and the theater district were a little closer in the opposite direction. So this hotel is a really good central location but if I could choose the ideal spot for this trip, based on what we did, it would have been a few more blocks up Michigan Ave. BIG bar and Snack Shop: The only other things we visited in the hotel were the BIG bar and the small coffee/snack shop. I really liked the BIG bar for a hotel bar. They serve some good cocktails and you can get them in BIG sizes. It is also very cool in that it has 2-3 story windows that look out on Chicago. We only had 1 drink there, and it was pricey, but it was one of the cooler hotel bars I have been in. The snack bar was handy, and 24hrs, but again it was pricey...which I always expect in a hotel. They also sold Starbucks there as well which would be handy for those people on business or in a hurry. We did not have a car but I would avoid having a car if possible since parking was $50. I didn't have a need for the WIFI although WIFI would have been nice to have it if were free. Check-out: The TV check-out didn't work so I used the kiosk in the lobby. Within a couple minutes we were checked out and it was just as easy as the TV So overall we liked the hotel and I would recommend it for the great room, good location, and if you can get a great price like we did. I would definitely stay here again if I got the same rate or a little higher but if I got their site rate I probably could have found something similar a couple blocks up Michigan Ave that would have suited our itinerary better.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cFor $50 to park I would expect them not to lose my keys\u201d", "Author": "zack876", "ReviewID": "UR116109870", "Content": "The only option to park at the hyatt, is $50 for valet parking.

The room was lovely and the bed was WONDERFUL! I slept more soundly the two nights we stayed than I do in my bed at home. The TV was nice, the bathroom was nice, and the room was quiet as well. All our interactions with the staff were very helpful and friendly, from the concierge staff to the bell-man, to the valet workers. The hotel was in a fantastic location! We ended up walking everywhere, except the Shedd Aquarium and Navy Pier. We were a short walk from Giordano's pizza (DELICIOUS Chicago deep-dish), several bakeries/coffee shops, and right next to Michigan Avenue shopping! Sunday brunch at Houlihan's was the best meal we had all week--it's literally a 2-minute walk from the Hyatt and the selection and taste was excellent! The hotel also has lots of different food and dining options available. We loved taking the water taxi, very close to the hotel on the river, and the river walk was just delightful. We were smart to take advantage of the hotel's facebook page, which offered multiple discounts on parking, dining, and other activities. They really do keep up with their fans on facebook and are prompt in answering questions their guests may have, as well as offering suggestions of places to see and eat. The thing that impressed me was that when we came back from dinner the first night, we had a tray of delicious gourmet toffee waiting for us with a hand-written note thanking us for choosing the Hyatt and being a part of their networking on facebook.

Before we arrived I did a little research and stumbled upon the Hyatt Regency Chicago facebook page. Their page is full of local events, things to do, as well as promotions where you can save on rates, parking, etc. You also have the ability to leave a wall post regarding your trip and someone will usually get back to you pretty quicky. I did this prior to my trip and had wondeful conversations with Jennifer who went out of her way to satisfy all my requests i.e. quiet rooms as well she made my 40th birthday extra special...ask her to sing for you if you ever get a chance to meet her :) We had arranged our own transporation and reached the hotel in no time from the airport. When you first walk in it is pretty daunting as it is a large hotel and there is a lot of activity going on however there were a number of staff at the front desk and the lines moved fairly quickly. Upon check-in, the concierge (I believe his name was Michael) welcomed me with a smile, and was very personable. He quickly got my friends and I set up in 3 rooms and we were ready to begin our vacation. The rooms were amazing. I was travelling with a friend who has travelled to Chicago many times and she commented that the room size was very generous compared to some of the other hotel rooms in the downtown area. I found the bed comfortable and there was very little hallway/elevator noise during the night. The location is pefect - a lot of things are within walking distance. The Navy Pier, Millenium Park as well as shopping on State Street and the Magnificant Mile. The river cruises depart from across the street so that was very convenient. For times when we did not want to walk we found the buses easy to use. My friends and I would definitely stay there again - in fact we've talked about making it an annual trip.

I had a room with a king size bed. The room was very spacious and nicely furnished. As I indicated this is a very large hotel and there were about 1200 people at the conference I attended. Needless to say, this caused a few minor challenges. For example, I arrived at the hotel at about 5:30 pm and my room wasn't ready. Apparently this was the case for numerous other folks who arrived later in the afternoon. Fortunately my wait for the room was not that long (about 20 minutes). The elevators were also a problem. When the conference broke for breaks, etc. you ended up with hundreds of people trying to access the elevators at the same time. My room was in the West Tower on the 11th floor ( there were 36 floors in total). Unfortunately, the elevators are not separated in groups by floors like you would normally see in other high rises. As a result the wait for an elevator as well as the rides up and down could be long at times. All of the staff I encountered were very pleasant and friendly.

For this business trip, I was precluded from staying anywhere else by my employer, and so did not choose this hotel myself. That said, I would heartily choose to stay (and also would recommend to others) at this Hyatt again. The hotel is perfectly located at the heart of the city along the river. The area abounds in eateries and drinkeries with much happening nearby. However, one doesn't really need to venture from the hotel to partake in these things, since the hotel has an abundant variety of these within its premises. From the lively and entertaining to the mellow and subdued, a guest can find a restaurant / bar that suits their style/mood. The hotel is spread out into two towers and does not at all feel cramped even though it accomodates many people for conferences. The hotel has an energizing atrium area that is the hub that connects the two towers with several other access walkways between the two above/below ground. Like most hotels that cater the business set, the hotel restaurants were pricey--a price for the convenience. The room I stayed in was reasonably sized, had a great view of the river, and was well appointed. The mattress was firm but not hard; TV large and clear; bath/shower adequately sized; and a bar refridge for those who wanted to pay for the convenience. The room had a safe abut I was surprised by it's smallness, hardly big enough to place a very small (10-12 inch??) laptop. [It could not accomodate my 17 inch laptop]. My room was adjoining the bank of elevators that server the tower I was staying in and as a result I could hear the whirr of the elevators as they went up/down. One evening my rest was less than restful because of my ablility to hear them. The hotel is definitely setup to be a conference hotel and I give it exceptionally high marks on this front. Nice business center; excellent conference space; concierge, front desk staff; quick check-in procedure; valet/bellhop; conference food service, etc. etc.etc.. That said, on two separate occasions I experienced poor (unprofessional) service from the wait staff. Carafes of hot coffee dumped a few feet from where I was sitting; tray full of food dropped onto the floor; coffee cups dropped. I am not sure what was happening -- there was a lot of people with a lot of things going on all around, but a little more care should be taken in these situations. Luckily no one was hurt from these accidents, other than our table had a bit of anxiety during each meal because of this. This was probably just an outlier events or the \"bad-day\" of one or two people. Overall, I felt the staff to be highly professional and courteous and attentive to guests.

However, when you connect to the internet, you still have to register and agree to a daily fee (which does not end up on the final bill). As the billing procedure was unclear to me, I asked the staff in the lobby. The first person I asked advised me to call the central tech support of the hotel, which was not what I wanted. Later, however, I found another member of the staff that could help me. The directions and procedure regarding internet access could be made clearer, and the staff better educated in this matter. - The breakfast buffet is rather focused on fat and sweet things. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy choices. The same billing confusion applies to the breakfast as the internet access. - The closet in my room had only one small shelf and no drawers. - The AC unit in my room was rather loud, and I had to sleep with ear plugs not to be woken by it. - The room was rather dark with only a few small lamps. - There were five big pillows in the bed, but they were actually too big for me to sleep comfortably with.

We booked the hotel via phone with Hyatt central reservations. We usually stay at a Marriott or Hilton but, despite several negative reviews online, thought we would try this hotel due to its location and price. To begin, central reservations listed our AAA rate as having complimentary internet (on the email confirmation). Based on several complaints about this very charge on TA, we called to confirm this. Central reservations said we did not have it despite the email, but that we did have comp. breakfast. We though this was agreeable and did not pursue the internet issue. We also noted that our confirmation via email has two adults and two children listed as guests. When we arrived we again checked with property desk staff about the breakfast because our in house self check-in receipt listed only two guests. We were told via phone (front desk) that four breakfasts would be complementary. The second day, in good faith, we checked to see if breakfast was complementary for one or two days. The manager said that we never had complimentary breakfast and if that was a component of our rate there would be only two. He further said that he would do us a great favor and take off the price of two of the four and also offer us two free the second day (which required us to purchase two more unless we let our kids watch us eat). Despite this, he would not comp all four for the first day. His attitude, as I perceived it, was not service oriented (unless the \"I am gong to make you a great deal\" [that costs you money] attitude is service), and he repeatedly said, only what is in writing matters. Essentially he was justifying lack of consistent verbal communication across Hyatt employees (though notably he would not admit our room came with comped internet, which we chose not to use based on the conversation with central reservations). The breakfast was not a small charge--$95 for four. It was nice but not that nice and we would have never purchased it if central reservations had not told us it was included (along with the local employee that said we would get four). This too, the manager simply did not understand (by his own words). The short story is the negative reviews you read on TA are accurate. Hyatt (or at least this Hyatt) will gauge you such that you should have stayed elsewhere for a slightly higher rate and avoided the hassle (the Embassy Suites breakfast is comparable and all guests receive it). Also, the hotel may be technically a four star property but three stars would be more accurate so that should be considered when comparing rates. One bright spot was the excellent housekeeping. In sum, based on miscommunication, we were stuck with ~47.00 charge (half was comped) that was represented to us a free. Hopefully Hyatt will get their employees across offices/properties and email confirmations in sync for future guests.

Considering the size of the conference (30,000+ attendees annually) and the distances being traveled by said attendees, it's not surprising that the Hyatt is one of the sponsoring hotels. However, to all the travelers considering Chicago's Hyatt Regency as a non-conference hotel (i.e. simply for leisure or personal travel), I would not recommend this hotel. The hotel is your typical over-sized, cavernous space -- complete with multiple towers of rooms/elevator banks/etc. It's a confusing space to navigate. It took three trips up and down various elevators and escalators to get to the ONE gym located on hotel grounds. If you are the type of traveler who enjoys luxurious comfort, privacy, excellent room service, and unobtrusive housekeeping, the Hyatt is NOT your hotel. For that in Chicago, I recommend the Peninsula or the Four Seasons. For a work trip in Chicago, Hyatt makes a lot of logistical sense; it's in a great location very close to the Loop downtown, and there are plenty of cabs always waiting by the front. My last point about the Hyatt -- the breakfast omelette of goat cheese and spinach, coffee, and fresh fruit w/yogurt was the worst room service meal I have ever consumed. The omelette, in particular, was atrocious. The only reason I force fed myself the food was because I had paid so much money for the breakfast. I would not recommend the Hyatt to a friend who is visiting Chicago for a personal/fun trip. Perhaps a work conference being held AT the hotel might be the only reason to justify the need to tolerate this type of second rate accommodation. There are better value and luxury/comfort options in Chicago.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in the best city in the world!\u201d", "Author": "Traveler2009", "ReviewID": "UR115019698", "Content": "We stayed at Hyatt Regency for 3 nights, June 30th to July 3rd. It is a great hotel in a great location and we got the room at a very good price for Chicago; we used Booking.com to make the reservation. Spotless room, king size bed with and amazing mattress and we also had great views of the Navy Pier, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6yes from the bed\u00ef\ufffd\u0160. Mind you, most rooms do not have such a great view as the hotel is huge and the East tower view of the pier is blocked by an apartment building. You can always ask for the view and maybe it works; that is exactly what we did. The first less than perfect thing I can bring up about our stay was the fact that we tried to contact the concierge and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been transferred back and forth for several minutes. We eventually gave up and found a restaurant on our own. If you ever been to Chicago, you should know that it is almost impossible not to find a good restaurant anyway\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. The second thing that was less then desirable, and this should be a serious concern for most; is parking. Downtown Chicago is bad for parking period. The hotel offers parking with In and Out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for 50$.... that is ridiculously expensive, but pretty much in line with what other hotels charge. Street parking in the area is time limited and it cost 5$ per hour during the day and 5$ for 2 hours at night. Options? There is really no good reason to bring your car if you only stay downtown Chicago and this would be your best option. CTA offers great service all over Chicago area. However if you have to have your car and if you have more time than money, here are some options: - Sundays and holydays you get free parking on Wacker dr. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not in front of the hotel but not far from it either (past Michigan towards Illinois, on both sides of Wacker). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been able to find a spot. - On La Salle, close to North St. Some sections are free Saturday and Sunday all day. Time restriction Monday to Friday. Cab back to the hotel 12 USD - Park further away, close to some of the L lines. Pay attention to permit and / or time restrictions. Sometimes it is 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 blocks away from the L stations before you can park, sometime just 50 yards. - You can also park at Navy Piers, 24$ / day. Not sure about in an out. - On the N side of the river, on the lower levels there is also parking for 28$, in a sea of 40$ lots. No in and out and the area looks questionable. There is a convenience store, open to midnight, about 50 yards from the hotel, on the east side of N Lower Stetson Ave. Wifi is available for 14.95/day through out the hotel, or if you can wait, go to the Corner Bakery on Wacker Dr. and its free. They have good food there as well.

My stay was a rare opportunity to experience my own town, the great city of Chicago, as a visitor. It actually made me envious of the many people who get to come here often on business. My base . . . the Hyatt Regency. As I always do, I am breaking my review down to the GREAT, GOOD, BAD, and UGLY with some bottom line-type comments. Ready? Let's do this . . . GREAT * The 'Backdrop': This is bold, beautiful, dynamic Chicago we're talking about here and the Hyatt Regency (referred to here henceforth as 'HR') is a great setting. On any level much higher than a standard ferris wheel, you will be treated to awesome views of the city, river, and Lake Michigan (I was on the 25th floor and really enjoyed the view). The hotel ITSELF offers a very impressive lobby area with one of the very best bars I have ever had the pleasure tipping a few back in. Seat yourself at the bar of the HR and enjoy a dramatic elevated backdrop of the Chicago River and city beyond - this is especially nice at night (see pic included). GOOD * Location: The HR is situated at a nice location for a visitor - just off the river and close to city-center and Navy Pier. When you stay at the HR you are in close proximity to the main shopping, dining, and party areas a little further north (and the more interesting areas even further northwest). Yet, you are also a short walk away from the many city-center attractions just south - like Millenium Park, the museums, Grant Park, etc. * Service: In a lot of other reviews here, the HR is referred to as 'impersonal' and 'not charming'. Well . . . duh! Folks, this is one of the largest non-gaming hotels in the WORLD (I think it might still be THE largest in room capacity). Complaining about this hotel lacking charm is like visiting a quaint boutique lakeside bed & breakfast and complaining about their 'terrible business center'. That said; I found the HR staff to be very friendly and helpful in limited interactions and I found the service to be highly efficient. When I arrived at registration I cringed at the long line but I was checked-in in no time and . . . I never had to wait long for my food or another Blue Moon at the beautiful bar. * Room temperature and 'comfort': I loved the room temperature control system - you just set the desired temperature and the system does the rest - very easy. And I found the room to be comfortable and very 'new' feeling but . . . BAD ('room' for improvement) * This is defintely the type of hotel you will remember years after your stay but . . . aside from the view, you will likely NOT remember the room itself. For such an otherwise great hotel, the rooms feature the standard cookie-cutter hotel room design with a bathroom being the first thing you encounter (either on the left or right) and the room beyond that. This is a minor knock but . . . I felt like they dropped the ball in not making even more use of the spectacular city backdrop with a more interesting room design. Then again, I had a lower priced room - perhaps that is the case if you upgrade. UGLY * I would have loved to have had my car during this stay (Chicago is a great convertible city) but . . . I could not have expensed the exorbant parking charges to my company in good conscious. I know its downtown and all but . . . $50 / night to park? That's 'how do you sleep with yourself?' expensive. BOTTOM LINE COMMENTS / RECOMMENDATIONS * You will not regret using the HR as your base when you visit the great city of Chicago. * DO request a high-level room * DO NOT bring a car if you can help it. Chicago is a very 'walkable' city with good public transportation (be sure to know where you are though) * If attending a trade show at McCormick - no prob. DO NOT stay at the McCormick Hyatt as your nighttime options will involve having to have a car or spending a fortune on cabs. Stay at the HR and use the show shuttle (there will most likely be a show shuttle) or pub trans from the nearby Millenium Station (there is a red line stop at McCormick).

Let me begin by saying that the Hyatt Regency Chicago did NOT disappoint me. I was pleasantly surprised, given the size of this 2000+ room hotel, at the level of personalized service we received. Maybe it was because we were there on a short getaway and not really in a hurry to get anywhere, but it seemed that everyone we encountered went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Due to a late checkout, part of our suite was not ready but Kari at the front desk went ahead and made up keys for our connector so we could freshen up (it was almost 100 degrees when we arrived!) and made sure we had access to the regency club where we could wait for the rest of our room to be ready. The main reason for our stay was a birthday trip for our two kids who have very close birthdays and boy did the Hyatt come through on the birthday. Jennifer, one of the managers, arranged for a beautiful birthday cake to be delivered to our room about 10 minutes after we arrived! This was totally unprompted and was VERY well received. I mentioned in my thank you letter to the hotel that my kids felt like big time VIP's! The only downside, and warrants mentioning, is that unless your count the fountain in the lobby, the hotel does not have a pool. Though my kids may disagree, spending time in a pool when you are in a city like Chicago is a waste of time. Overall we had a great 4 days in Chicago due in no small part to the Hyatt Regency Chicago! Additional tips: Either fly in or take the train, but leave the car at home; parking is $50/night. Parking is expensive but not unrealistic considering the value of real estate in downtown Chicago. If you are going to visit the museums, look into the Chicago CityPass. Best meal bang for the buck - hands down, Market Bistro in the Fox and Obel market. Three words: market price wine. Last but not least fireworks at Navy Pier on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

When we checked in they said all the Regency Club rooms had been booked. They offered to upgrade us to a suite. When we looked at the room it had a pull down bed. It was like a meeting room.

This hotel faces onto the river in the downtown area, a good spot for access to the bars and restaurants of the Near North Side (across the river), and Millenium Park & the Art Institute of Chicago a few blocks South. It is huge, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing (I once found the Hyatt in Xian, China to be a virtual island of sanity in a difficult town) and all staff are unfailingly polite and efficient. But it is awful. Turn on the TV (the most ridiculously large plasma screen) and instead of going to the last channel viewed it defaults to a series of screens offering pay-per-view services.Eventually I navigated to the TV channels (very limited in number for such an establishment), but every time I changed channels the TV reverted to the start-up pay-per-view menus. I am fairly sure that had I inadvertantly selected one of these services I would have been charged without recourse to a refund. How can I be so sure? Because it fits the pattern. Do you like to leave a bottle of water or the chocolates you've bought as a present in the minibar fridge? Forget it. Any food, drink or (get this) medication left in the refrigerated mini-bar (which is apparently \"not a fridge\") gets removed and binned each morning - there's a warning to this extent, together with the generous offer to store all your perishables in the hotel fridge, for a very reasonable $25. I tried to be clever - storing some milk in the minibar overnight and removing it in the morning - but there is clearly some sort of weight monitor, and I was fined $6 for \"mini-bar infringement.\" So to the bed. I gave up sleeping on a foam mattress when I was 8, but in this hotel there is no choice. Not the place to stay if you like a firm bed. Internet: of course the place is wi-fi'd. Many hotels in Chicago seem to offer free wi-fi for residents. I started to log-on and there didn't seem to be any indication that there was a charge: residents are just asked to enter their name and room number. Before doing this I went to the Frequenty Asked Questions, pretty sure that many people would ask \"am I being charged for this?\" Apparently not, since it didn't feature. So I called down to the front desk. Just as well - I saved myself $15/day. This place exemplifies all that is worst in corporate American hotels. The grasping need to extract every single cent from guests whose rooms (often payed for by other corporate giants) are priced way over their actual value.

Rooms. The rooms are very nice. They were spacious, had a large bathroom, nice beds, pillows, etc. Very quiet too, considering it's prime location. Negatives: The parking at the hotel is $50 a night, which I think is a little ridiculous. We did not have to park a car, but if we had I would have parked in one of the nearby common parking areas, as they were much cheaper. Also, we booked our room on a discount online retailer and got it for right around $100 with tax. I tried to add another night to our stay and all of the discount sites said it was sold out. I checked the hotel website and the price was $225! It was a great hotel for $100, but I personally would not have paid $225, even for such a nice place.

The Hyatt Regency Chicago has a good location on the river, far enough from the raucous crowds but close enough to walk almost anywhere in the loop and river north. This is a very large property, with separate East and West towers (you have to take the elevator down to concourse to get from one to the other) and many conference facilities. The rooms are well-furnished and modern. Lighting is good, the TV screens are large, and there's been a full-length mirror in every room I've tried. Unfortunately, with the exception of the hypo-allergenic \"PURE\" rooms, room surfaces can be very dusty and unappealing. The in-room furniture (desk chair and day chair) are reasonable but not extremely comfortable. The staff is generally friendly but can be overwhelmed at peak times. The common areas are well-staffed with people to help you with your luggage and get you on your way. As I mentioned in my title, the one problem that spoils this otherwise decent hotel is the in-room \"high-speed\" internet service. The past few times I've stayed here, I've consistently been unable to maintain a connection with enough speed to adequately read web pages, load email, and chat on instant messenger. I can't even dream about getting on VPN for work, video chat with family, or stream any videos -- it just doesn't work! One night, in-room internet at the entire property wasn't working. For a hotel that caters to many business travelers, I honestly don't know how they get away with it.

The Hyatt rooms have always been spacious by downtown Chicago standards, but the makeover makes them seem even more so. The new rooms have an elegant modern minimalist look, without taking it to annoying extremes like some boutique hotels. The room furniture is sleekly elegant, and the flat-screen TVs are nice. The bathrooms too have gotten the mod makeover, with cool sinks. (My only gripe is the awkward placement of the toilet paper spool.) My big king bed was a tad bit firm but overall very comfortable, and the Hyatt thankfully has taken away a few of the pillows they tossed on the bed in the older rooms. (There were way too many). The public areas are as busy as they ever were, but for such a big hotel check-in is a relative breeze and service is about as efficient as it can be. I didn't eat at any of the in-house restaurants (I never do) but there are plenty of them. Location wise, the hotel is in a prime spot about a block from Michigan Avenue on the south side of the Chicago River. It's connected to the Illinois Center and its ersatz collection of fast-food outlets and offices. If you're smart and taking transit, the CTA Jackson bus (no. 6) and several rush hour-only buses stop right across from the hotel entrance at Wacker & Stetson.

We stayed on the 30th floor of the new/updated east towers and really liked the room. It was medium-sized, nice view, and the bathroom was clean and decent size. We couldn't hear the other rooms but could hear loud people walking down the hallway during the day and at night - for this reason I would recommend that you request a room as far away from the elevator banks as possible.

Also if you want a real \"view\" of the city then you'll be charged an extra $20/night as well but since we didn't plan on spending much time in the room we opted not to have that added.

Check-In was quick and pleasant...the doormen, parking valets and desk clerks did their job in a professional manner. Luckily we booked a package with complimentary valet for only $20 over the discount room rate, so we got a break on the $50 dollar a day parking charge (wow!). The room itself was comfortable, but not remarkable. The beds were nice, the linens were nice quality, and the room featured a nice desk work area and a large Panasonic flat screen television. With that being said, the room could've used a little deep cleaning. The area behind the nightstand obviously hadn't been tended to in awhile, and on our final night we found a disgusting brownish substance on the wall behind a curtain. The bathroom was large and very clean...and was the best part of the room. The bathroom felt very modern, and the standard amenities were provided. Overall, the room was quiet with hallway noise barely discernable. We dined one night in Bistro 151. The food was good, if typically high priced. The service was well intended, but spotty. We frequently had to remind our server to bring requested condiments, utensils and drinks that were ordered. Sincere apologies followed, but at some point getting it right the first time would've been more appreciated. I love the location of the Hyatt....convenient to the Magnificent Mile, Theater District and Navy Pier. With that being said, there are several other \"big hotels\" located in the same vicinity, that offer essentially the same lodging experience and levels of service. My advice would be check the Hyatt, the Westins, Swissotel, Intercontinental, even the Hotel Sax and shop for the best deal.

Check-in was fast and easy, and the room was a very good size and well-appointed. They even provide complimentary brand-name toothpaste in the room, which in my experience is rare. The initial problem was that they put us in a room with a connecting door to the adjacent room, which happened to host a screaming baby. I went down that evening to ask for a room change, but they were full that night and offered to move all our bags into a new room the next day while we were out as long as we had all our stuff packed. They also gave us $50 hotel credit on any food and beverages. The baby had stopped crying when we returned to the room to go to sleep, so no problem. In the morning we packed all our stuff and before leaving the hotel I went by the desk to double check that the move was in order. Yep, our new room would be set up with all our stuff after 3pm. We return at 6pm, and they haven't gotten us a new room or moved our stuff. I got quite angry as I had even double-checked the move. They were extremely apologetic, got a manager right on it, upgraded us to a deluxe room on the top floor, and gave us access to the Regency Club. They really bent backwards to make up for their mistake. To tell you the truth, it was really worth the 15 minutes it took at the desk and to move to the new room. So for $199 for 3 nights including taxes, we got great service (after the initial mistakes), a deluxe room, $50 hotel credit, and access to the Regency Club.

This is a must-stay if you are in Chicago! Now, for my detailed review: My wife and I arrived extremely late on Thursday, having an 11pm arrival into Midway. I was worried that service might be lacking due to the late hour, but I was very happy to find that it was not. Check-in service was top-notch, with the Front Desk Agent repeatedly thanking me for my loyalty as a Hyatt Diamond Gold Passport Member. He quickly and efficiently checked us in, providing us with our Diamond Amenity Card and suggesting that we have our Diamond Amenity delivered just before dinner on Friday since it was so late. He also informed us that we had been Upgraded to a very nice \"Junior Suite.\" Overall, it was an extremely pleasant check-in experience despite the late hour. Upon arrival at our room, I had no idea what to expect. Having used one of my Diamond Suite Upgrade Certificates to Confirm a Suite prior to arrival, I assumed that I would merely be given a standard, Connector Suite -- that assumption was completely incorrect! As soon as my wife and I stepped into the Suite, we were extremely surprised and happy ... the \"Junior Suite\" was anything but \"Junior.\" We were given Room 3027, on the 30th Floor of the West Tower, right on the Riverwalk. We had a truly beautiful view of the River, as well as the City Skyline. We were looking directly at the beautiful architecture of the Tribune Building, as well as the Wrigley Building and Michigan Avenue. And, in the distance, Lake Michigan was visible. It was a truly amazing view -- one of the best City View Rooms that I have ever experienced. In addition to the View, all other aspects of the room were amazing as well. It was not merely a small parlor connected to a standard bedroom but was instead a truly large Suite. As you walk in, you have a small hallway leading to a dining table that could seat eight. In front of that dining table was a very nice large computer-style work desk and a very large floor-to-ceiling window with the excellent view I have mentioned above. To the left of the dining and work area of the room was a rather large sitting area, complete with a sectional couch and a large Murphy Bed, plus a very comfortable chair and ottoman. There was the usual large flat screen television, and a very nice bathroom with large glass shower, double sink/vanity, and all of the Deluxe VIP Portico Bath Products. To the right of the dining and work area of the room was the connecting bedroom -- Room 3026. This was a very nice, typical Hyatt bedroom, with one of the most comfortable Hyatt King Beds that I have ever had. This bedroom had all of the typical amenities, including a mini-bar, large flat screen television, and decent sized work desk and chair with the same amazing view and floor-to-ceiling windows as the Suite. As for the bathroom, it was a typical bathroom -- smaller than the Suite bathroom with just one sink/vanity, but it had an equally nice shower with the Deluxe VIP Portico Bath Products. A perfect place to sleep after a long day of shopping on Michigan Avenue! As for the dining and service, both were top-notch at this property, and we had a chance to experience many different venues. On Thursday night, after checking in, we had a drink at the \"Big Bar\" located near the Main Lobby Atrium. It was a very nice bar -- but it was just far too crowded on that Thursday night, as there was a large convention at the hotel. But, the drinks were well prepared and the service was decent considering the huge crowd. All-in-all, a very nice bar that I would definitely love to frequent on less crowded evenings. On Friday morning, we opted for Breakfast in the Regency Club. The Regency Club was a very well-appointed large area on the 35th Floor of the West Tower, complete with nice views of the City. Although we did not sample the evening fare, we did enjoy the continental style breakfast. My only complaint would be lack of a hot entree option, as I am not a huge fan of salmon with my bagels. But, definitely a very well appointed Regency Club -- had we had more time, I would have liked to try the evening fare and the \"honor bar.\" Hopefully on another trip soon! Friday evening, we did not eat a full meal, as we were absolutely stuffed from our meal in the City -- off topic, but I highly recommend the Weber Grill Restaurant, located at the Hilton Garden Inn for an amazing lunch -- so instead, we snacked on our Diamond Amenity. I had chosen the Cabernet combined with the Fruit and Cheese Platter. It was a very unique assortment of cheeses and flat breads. Definitely a very tasty and filling Diamond Amenity, which put us in the perfect mood for our night at the Theater. As we left for the Theater on Friday night, we saw another example of exceptional Hyatt customer service -- the taxi line. Normally in a big city, one might have to wait for a cab. But, at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, the cab line was very well staffed, with a constant flow of cabs. The Bellman made every effort to get people out of the cold and into a cab as quickly and efficiently as possible. I also note that he screened the cabs, to make sure that cab drivers who the hotel has had issues with are not loaded -- we saw such stellar service first hand! We were next in the cab line and the next cab pulled forward -- but, the Bellman refused to load us into that cab, and instead ushered us into the next waiting cab, explaining to that original cab driver that he was not welcome at the Hyatt. Truly great customer service with the Bellman always looking out for his guests! On Saturday morning, we tried Room Service for Breakfast. We figured that we had such a beautiful view of the City, combined with such a nice dining table that a Room Service Breakfast would be perfect -- and it was! The food quality was superb, and arrived piping hot. Definitely very top-notch room service ... I would highly recommend it! Then, Saturday afternoon, we tried one of the other bars, \"The Bar at 151\" -- located on the lower level of the East Tower, just below the Main Lobby. The service there was also very good, and the drinks were quite a strong pour. This was definitely a very nice, relaxing bar atmosphere, compared to the packed \"Big Bar\" feel from earlier in the trip. Definitely a very nice bar that I would highly recommend. Finally, on Saturday evening, we had a truly AMAZING dinner at Stetson's Chop House. My wife has eaten there several times with her family, and I have been there once before with them. Saturday's service equaled if not excelled our prior experiences at Stetson's. This is probably the all-time best steakhouse that I have ever been to -- if you are in Chicago, you absolutely must try this amazing place! We had 5:30pm reservations, which is when it opened. As we arrived, we were offered a seat at the bar to wait for seating to begin. I'd never experienced the bar at Stetson's before, but the bar service was equally good. We all had a round of very nicely poured drinks, along with some cashews to snack on before being ushered to our table. Service was truly amazing, and the foods were to die for with extremely generous portion sizes. This is definitely one dinner not to miss while at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. All-in-all, it was a truly amazing long weekend at the Hyatt Regency Chicago for my wife and I. We will definitely be back soon, and we would highly recommend this property to anyone staying in Chicago on business or pleasure!", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayzata, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at Hyatt Regency Chicago\u201d", "Author": "mrfargo2", "ReviewID": "UR86212783", "Content": "Was here just one night on a business trip.

When will hotels learn that, if they have rooms with connecting doors, these should at least be insulated properly when not in use eg with padding or a sound-proof cover.

One room was upgraded to a state suite which allowed us more room for my husband, son and me. The room wasn't located in the West Tower, but I was afraid to ask for too much since we had been given the suite. Probably should have but we were pleased with the East Tower. The suite had a beautiful view of the river and Michigan Ave. My daughter and son in law were on a different floor but were pleased with their room as well-- view wasn't so great though. Heard about the wait on the elevators,but we only had difficulty in the mornings when everyone was heading out for the day. The hotel is about a 5 min. walk from the train. At first we were a little turned around when exiting the Orange Line from Midway. A very nice man directed us to the hotel -- I guess we looked a little lost standing on the street with our suitcases and confused looks on our face. : ) After getting our bearings, we found the hotel to be a great location.

Their excuse, \" toliets are green to save water and don't flush as strong\" 2. Big sign in the room bar/refridge \"if put anything even medications in here, we will charge you $25.oo each time we see it. Of course you can order a refridg for $25 per day. 3. Want a newspaper at your door. Sorry, they are green...Take will be part of a deluxe package with the internet for $20-30 a day. 4. I got offered a nice view for guess what? $50.00 5. They did tell me I could get the newpaper deliverd on-line for free. All I had to do was pay $13.85 per day for the internet. Why because they are now \"green\" have to save that paper. However, the papers are in the lobby for free. In other words it is just done to day them from paying for service to your room! 6. Expecting a bill under your door for fast checkout? Not at this hotel! It's green! you have to go to the desk to get one. Once again just to save them the labor charge. 7. This was a tax forum conference with about 3000 people in attendance and the bathrooms in the conference area were ALWAYS filthy. Guess it was more \"green\" to let people throw the paper on the floor and leave filthy toilets then to hire help to clean them. 8. Need to use your cell phone or PDA while at a conference. NO way. Not here. No reception. Does not matter who your carrier is. But of course staying \"green\" there are terminals downstairs where you can pay $25.oo to connect to their computer that surprisingly gets service!

We arrived the day of the Blackhawks victory parade, around 10am. I had requested early check-in and was promptly provided a room on the 14th floor of the main tower. I was unimpressed with this room--it was dark and the view was largely obstructed. I asked the desk if they could perhaps switch me to a renovated room in the West tower, and they were extremely accommodating in doing so. This was a very positive experience to me, as I know the variations large hotels have between rooms. Having stayed in the Trump, Ritz, 4 Seasons, and Park Hyatt in Chicago, I was delightfully surprised by the room. We had an 8th floor room with a prime view of the River and the Michigan Avenue bridge. The bed was luxurious, the desk area nicely appointed and well-laid out, and the window-side chair and ottoman comfortable. The large flat-screen TV was a nice touch. Overall, it was a large, modern hotel room with typical Hyatt Regency amenities and a view that hands-down beat anything I've had at the Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, or Ritz-Carlton. The bathroom was less than stellar, with an older shower-bath and poor water pressure. The sink was newly redesigned and was fine. Being in the West Tower, we never experienced the crowds that lingered in the lobby of the main building, and had a more intimate experience than I was expecting from such a large hotel.

Pretty much a conference hotel - rooms are comfortable with great beds like you expect from Hyatt. Its the small details here that you would expect from a Hyatt Regency that I missed. No TV channel guide - so had to keep surfing to try and find channels. No room information of any kind other than room service menu. No waste basket in room, so had to use the one in the bathroom when working at the desk (or move it from the bathroom - only to be returned each day by the maid). Huge backlit mirror in the bathroom is very stylish, but very little shelf space for personal items - except a very narrow shelf above the toilet - so don't put anything that can 'fall in'. No bathmat on half the days. Work surface on desk area is again very stylish - but so smooth and reflective that you can't use an optical mouse. Few electric outlets - so you have to unplug something to use more than one or two plugs (most business travelers will need more than the one desktop outlet). Wifi overpriced like most business hotels - cheaper hotels all give this for free which is a pet peeve... at the rate I paid, you'd think they could through this into the rate. Bars/Restaurants nice, but overpriced enough to make you want to walk a block or two for a more reasonable meal or drink. Minibars are new 'if you even touch anything you bought it' - again overpriced and you can't move anything around to put your own water, etc. Minibar service person seemed to always interrupt at the most inopportune time even though she always said 'I know you didn't use anything' - so why does she have to check? Good things: Reading lights at bed, very nice. Great bed like all Hyatts. Nice views from most rooms. Overall, this hotel seems dedicated to business travelers who need to be here for a conference and where the company will pay for the high rates just to stay within the confines of the venue.

One of the reasons that I stayed at this hotel was because I received a GREAT rate from Priceline.com for a stay on Magnificent Mile in Chicago.

Not only was the rate accepted by the Hyatt Regency great , but so was the experience of staying at the hotel. The check in service was quick and friendly, I was given clean and inviting room, the staff was friendly and attentive, and I enjoyed my 2 day weekend leisurely stay . The Hyatt Regency on Wacker Drive is centrally located on Magnificent Mile and is within walking distance to many of Chicago's sight-seeing venues, including Millenium Park and the Chicago Art Institute. Shopping is also within walking distance of the hotel, right along N. Michigan (Magnificent Mile) or the Loop district of downtown Chicago, where Macy's Department Store is located. There are plenty of fantastic restaurants within walking distance including one that I would recommend called \"Quartinos\" (N.State/Ontario) (Italian - with thin crust pizza and gourmet toppings - gourmet pastas and other savory cuisine ) A gourmet topping thin crust pizza and a 1/4 bottle of merlot cost me $20 plus tip ... a reasonable price for a good meal and pleasant service. When I arrived at around 5:30 p.m. the restaurant was full, however the staff was quick to accommodate me with a table for one, which most restaurants don't normally do. So 'Quartino's' receives a a very strong approval rating from me on its food, service and menu pricing.

Since my wife was not terribly keen on the idea of taking a cab alone if she needed to go somewhere when I was in my meeting, we decided to go ahead and book at the Hyatt at that rate. Looking back, and knowing what people are bidding on these rooms, I would NOT pay $139 again. The hotel's location is decent; our room looked out over the river, and we were able to walk to all the places we wanted to go (except the Willis tower--that's a bit of a hike.) Cab from Union Station was roughly 6 bucks. We were greeted by a doorman who directed us to the 2nd floor of the East Tower for check in. He unloaded our luggage from the trunk of the taxi. In through the automatic revolving door, up the escalator, and to check-in. There was a bit of a line, but there were 6 or 7 people working the desk, and it took no longer than 5 minutes to get checked in. The lady made sure to let us know about needing our hotel key to operate the elevators at night, and that there were sensors in the snack/mini bar. If you pick something up from there, you are charged immediately. Our room was 2362, and I can echo the sentiment of a previous reviewer who had a xx62 room--you can hear the rumble of the elevators all the time, as you're the second door down from the bank of elevators. It sounds like a distant rumbling--exactly as described, like you're too close to the el. My wife and I are medium sleepers, and it did not keep us awake or anything; if you sleep light, get a room farther away. Our next door neighbor cranked up the radio when he/she took a shower one afternoon, and we could hear every word of the music, but once the shower was over, we could hear nothing else from any nearby rooms. One night a group of college students yelled down the hall outside, but that was a one-off. Otherwise, it was quiet. We had a king room, and it was fine. Maybe a little on the small side, but not too bad. The desk and office chair were helpful for typing on the laptop. One note--while there is WiFi at the hotel, and an ethernet cord in your room, the internet isn't free. We didn't need it, since we carry smartphones. The \"J's Express\" coffee/snack shop in the lobby offers good stuff at decent prices, and the baristas there serve very good Starbuck's products. The gift shop next door is a bit overpriced. I know cigarettes are expensive in Chicago, but they charge $10.98 per pack. If you're a smoker, you can probably get a better deal at a Walgreens within walking distance. Eating at the lobby coffee shop is too expensive. We paid $51 for a lunch of two sandwiches, two salads, and two teas. Walk to a nearby restaurant. Our food was decent, but bland and nothing to write home about. For much less, we ate a lot better at Pizano's Pizza. One note--this hotel will lock you out of your room if there is a problem with your credit card. For some reason, mine was rejected the first time they tried to run it (on check-out morning) and when I came back upstairs with coffee, my key no longer worked. The maid's master key didn't, either. We went to the front desk, where the clerk cheerfully fixed the problem and issued 2 new keys--she also checked us out at that time. However, when we got back up to the 23rd floor, the new keys didn't work. A call to the front desk resulted in my being transferred twice, with clerks saying that we were already checked out, before they sent a security lady to unlock our door. On the plus side, the security lady arrived within 5 minutes and was very sweet. For smokers: rather than going out the front door for a cigarette, there's a much better smokers nook on the side of the building; go to the 1st floor, and from the elevators take the first door to the left, just after Stetson's. Also, if you want an immediate cab, there's a taxi stand right outside that door. Nice place overall, but I agree with others that they try to nickle and dime you too much. That's probably okay if you're traveling on a company expense account, but for the casual traveler or vacation, hit one of the bidding websites, and do NOT plan on getting anything from inside the hotel.

My family-which includes myself, husband and 14 year old son-chose this hotel because of its close proximity to attractions (walking distance to Michigan Avenue) and the AAA Breakfast Rate-$151.01 tax included) for a lake view room and full breakfast buffet for two- was unbeatable! The fact that my best friend gave us a $50 Hyatt gift card for Christmas certainly influenced our decision as well. When we checked in, we could not have asked for better service than what we received from Maria. She was friendly, helpful and answered all our questions concerning how to find particular restaurants and shops in Chicago. She also was kind enough to give us an extra breakfast voucher for our son, so we would not have to pay for his meal! What impressed me about the room was the size of the two double beds. Normally we get a king bed with a rollaway when we travel, but since we were staying one night only we agreed to make the best of it so we would not have to pay for a rollaway. We were pleasantly surprised to find they were queen sized beds, which were the most comfortable hotel beds we ever slept in! We were also upgraded at no charge to a renovated room in the West Tower, which was immaculate. As requested, our room overlooked the Chicago River, Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. The breakfast buffet was excellent (it costs $22 per person if you don't have a breakfast package) and included some of the best oven-roasted potatoes I have ever eaten. Other foods on the breakfast menu were bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, omelets to order, Eggs Benedict, turkey ham, pancakes, bagels, cereals, muffins and fruit. Our servers, Punkaj and Alberto, were very accommodating and professional. I also like the fact that taxis are in front of the hotel constantly. That certainly came in handy when we decided to go to Navy Pier. You could walk to Navy Pier from the hotel but you have to cross a highway. Even the hotel recommends you take a taxi there, which ran us about $7.00 each way. The hotel definitely caters to a business clientele, as there are no pools or game rooms for kids. But we were so tired from sightseeing in Chicago all day that those amenities were irrelevant to us. To be perfectly honest, I have nothing negative to say about this place, and I am a very particular traveler, as anyone who has read my past reviews can attest to. My family agrees on two things-1.

Trust me, its not easy to find. There were 40 people in line and only 2 people working the front desk. After 45 minutes, we were finally able to check in.

J's Express was supposed to be 24 hours, but when I arrived at 5:45am for an early flight, there was no one there. The trip to the airport is 30 minutes and I was disappointed to not have any food. $13+ a day seemed a bit much for internet access (and it wasn't that accessible - I had to plug in), the elevators were incredibly slow & it didn't seem like they were all functioning. The only other disappointing piece was the food for room service. I ordered 2 dinners and they were both mediocre and a bit pricey for the quality. I did not try the restaurants on site.

I took the \"Go Airport Express\" from O'Hare which cost me $50 for a roundtrip ticket and arrived in about 30 minutes to the hotel. There is a main reservation desk in the main lobby, but the van dropped me off at the West tower and I just checked in at the small desk there. The West tower is in the middle of being renovated, so there is construction going on if that is a concern before you stay here. When I saw my room, I couldn't have been more pleased. I had a great view of the river and it was just renovated so everything looked brand new. It is right near Michigan Avenue and awesome restaurants. I'm not sure why another reviewer said not to walk around the neighborhood at night. It seemed perfectly safe to me with lots of people walking around. Anyway, the bathroom was clean with a mirror which was backlit, so putting on my makeup was like being at the makeup counter at a department store. However, my pleasure soon turned to displeasure at about midnight when I was awoken by my neighbor's TV. My room had two adjoining doors to the neighboring rooms. By the way, why do hotels do this? Most people don't need to share rooms. Anyway, I could hear every word of his program he was watching. The TV wasn't loud, it was because of those adjoining doors which offer no soundproofing! This was proven again the next morning when I heard my other neighbor on the phone. I could hear every word she was saying, including her full phone number when she left someone a message! I asked the front desk to move me, but they didn't have any rooms available. So it continued for 3 days. I heard my neighbor's TV at night, blowing his nose, the other neighbor on her phone...it was a complete nightmare. This next example will show you how poor the soundproofing is: I was awoken at 5am by my phone vibrating on the nightstand (or so I thought was my phone). I went to go turn it off, and it wasn't my phone vibrating- it was my neighbor's!! Then I heard him walk to the bathroom...urinate...then let out a big fart. It sounded like he was in my bathroom, not in another room! Now.....If I can hear all this, it tells you how BAD the soundproofing is between the rooms. If other people who have stayed here have adjoining rooms like this and don't hear anything...its either because they had no neighbors, or they were very quiet. If you do choose to stay here, make sure to ask for a room without the connecting doors. I couldn't sleep well, because I was kept up late by one neighbor...then awoken early by another. Oh, and my sink started backing up also, but I asked them to come fix it after I checked out since I didn't want to deal with it. The whole experience was just terrible. Adding to the nightmare, the last morning I decided to splurge for room service for breakfast because I was in a rush. I ordered a bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese. Imagine my surprise when my bagel turned out to be blueberry. Since when is a blueberry bagel eaten with smoked salmon?!? Glad that set me back $25. Although the room was clean and the hotel was in a convenient location, hearing every movement by my neighbors at all hours completely negates anything positve about this hotel. I asked my colleague how her stay was. Her shower knob broke off the first time she tried to use it, and she couldn't access her coffee maker because it was built into an alcove. The cord was too short so she couldn't pull it out of the alcove to open the top to put water in it. She also said she didn't even have any counter space in the bathroom to put her things. I showed her the pictures of my bathroom, and she said hers didn't look like that at all. She was in the West tower also. Parking here is about $53 a day, so if you have a rental car, just beware of that. The breakfast buffet was $22, so its not a cheap either. I was very disappointed in my stay, but again, if you do stay here, ask for a room that doesn't have adjoining doors, and maybe in the main tower you'll have better luck not the West tower.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice convention hotel\u201d", "Author": "buttons78", "ReviewID": "UR56306638", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while I was in Chicago to attend the 2010 Annual Symposium.

There are also several very convenient bus routes on Michigan that can take you up to Lincoln Park or to Union Station. The concierge was very friendly and extremely knowlegable. The best part about the visit was the extra service. I accidentally left my !wallet! at the coffee kiosk on the lower level. It took me about a half hour to realize this by which time I was about a mile away from the hotel. I called the hotel and explained the situation and it turned out that the staff had found my wallet and were keeping it in security for me to pick up. It was such a huge relief.

Here are the lowlights: Got to the room and noticed that there was some black stuff in the caulking around the tub. (See photos). I mentioned it to the front desk staffer, who apologized profusely. She said the housekeeping manager would get right on it while we were out at dinner. We got back from dinner and...still had the black stuff in the tub. So, the next morning, I brought it to the attention of the new front desk staffer on duty, and she, too, apologized profusely. (Using almost identical wording as the first woman. As if there were a script she was following...) We asked her to have the housekeeping team address it while we were out at breakfast, so that we could have a clean tub for the rest of our stay. Shockingly, there was no change in our tub after breakfast. Went back to the counter, spoke with the same staffer from earlier in the morning. She asked if we'd like to move to a new room, which, while inconvenient, sounded like a good idea. To her credit, she did offer to give us some sort of freebie for our trouble. But since I didn't need free internet or food vouchers, there was apparently nothing else she could offer me. I asked if they could comp my $48 parking bill (yes, that's a daily rate!) Sorry, no dice. So, we went to look at the new room. Unfortunately it had gunk in the tub too! (See photo.) What's This Foolishness? Making matters worse, when we returned from breakfast, we found that our sheets actually had multiple rips and tears in them! It was impossible to miss them, which tells me that the housekeeping staff either didn't care or wasn't given the guidance that, you know, ripped sheets don't really enhance the Hyatt brand. So, I pulled the ripped sheets off the bed and went back to the front desk. We told the desk agent we'd stay in our original room since the new one wasn't much better.

To their credit they provided us with a complimentary nights stay should we return, which we did last week. When we checked in this time we reminded them of the problem we had last year and asked them to locate us into a room that would hopefully be very quiet this time around. All was going great until approximately 1:30 am when we heard a man scream very loudly from the room next door. This was followed by deep moans, groans,and screams from a women and it was obvious there was some very intense business going on . Now this was not just any ordinary session taking place-it was right out of the movies and went on for what seemed to be an eternity. I am not criticizing what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own room but the walls of this hotel are paper thin and what should have been private was anything but-and I mean this was REALLY LOUD.

While I agree that the walls are thin, I went to bed early (by chicago standards) at midnight and had absolutely no problem with noise. Elevators are very quick, too. I read in a previous review not to park here (because of a $48/day fee) so instead I drove to Midway Airport and parked economy for $14/day with a free shuttle to the terminal where I then took the Orange Line CTA into the loop for the hotel. Train rides are $2.25 one way and very easy to figure out. The Hyatt was only 3 quick blocks from the train stop. Bell desk kept my bag after checkout for me, coffee was available in my room, a/c worked great, beds comfy and the pillows were incredible! Contemporary updated design, small room was plenty large enough for 2 people. Since I was traveling alone I gave the front desk the freedom to put me in a room with any kind of bed. I received a room with a queen bed and a magnificent view (all for $62/night!) There are several restaurants in this hotel from Bistro 151, to Stetsons (steakhouse), to an Irish pub, and another sandwich place. Also, the bar called BIG also serves food until midnight, which I was happy to see as not many restaurants were open at midnight on Michigan Ave. I ordered the \"pizza of the day\" which was a pepperoni and sausage.

The problem with that from the Hyatt's perspective is that Westin is much more contemporary, stylish, price effective, and the staff are friendlier. So on the comparison, Hyatt would have been better to keep me for the whole five nights as I had originally booked! Anyway, the Hyatt Regency has a few problems. The rooms look and feel as though they are from the 1970's. The shower head in my room was water and grime stained where it had been in use for so long. The toilet was also stained from years of use. Another problem was an over-zealous group of cleaners. They were desperately trying to kick you out of your room every morning so they could clean, and seemingly didn't understand when you told them to come back later on. Unless you stay on the top floors, you also need to be prepared to wait for long periods of time for the lifts, as they are almost certain to be full by the time they reach you. This can honestly result in a 10 minute wait. The staff weren't as friendly as at Westin either, and the selection of foods in the restaurant weren't as nice.

The Hyatt has to be one of the biggest hotels in Chicago with 2 separate towers each over 35 stories tall. This is not a boutique or personal-service hotel. The hotel lobby is a two-story atrium that seems to be busy at all hours, more like an airport terminal than anything. Despite the size, the place seems to run pretty well. There were no problems with check-in or baggage. We were offered a newly-remodled room with less of a view or an older room with a better view. We took the newer and made a good choice. The furnishings were fresh and modern with dark woods, leather chair, flat panel TV, modern art and new carpet. The entire floor was airy and bright, not the sort of maroon carpet and cookie-cutter paintings you might expect. On the down side, the walls are a little thin and the hallways can be loud. We were stationed at the end of one of the H-shaped hallways, so noise wasn't a problem. It might be if you get a room on the main hallway or near the elevators. The elevators are what you expect in a hotel of this size: crowded and slow. There wasn't any real down side, but nothing spectacular either. We didn't really stay in the hotel other than to sleep, but we did have a drink at the \"Big Bar\" in the second floor atrium. It is, indeed, big. We were on one of the concierge floors, which entitled you to access to the 35th floor lounge. This had snacks and light meals during the day. We visited several times, and mainly refueled with soft drinks or juice. The snacks and meals weren't our speed since the place was crowded and we didn't go to Chicago to eat bagels in the hotel. One suprise plus was the view (even though our room wasn't supposed to have much of a view). We looked out onto the Michigan Ave. bridge and the Wrigley Building across the river. It was great to look out the window at all hours. That's really the best part of this property: It's steps away from both the Michigan Ave. shopping areas as well as the Loop and Millennium Park. You really don't need a car to get to either area.

Got to the check-in counter at about 9PM on a Tuesday and after a couple of minutes of \"I have to check something\", I was told that they were overbooked and they would send me to another hotel for the night and give me my rooms the following day. Of course I did not accept that arrangement, specially since they had already charged me for the rooms. After about half an hour of discussion, asking for the manager (which very conveniently the clerck told me she was the manager) they would simply not give me any rooms, so I relented and asked where would the put me for the night, only to be told that they would send me to the Hyatt in O'HARE????? What???? There must be some crazy manager running that place. I vehemently oppsosed and told them I would not go anywhere until they gave me my rooms that were already paid for. After some 15 more minutes of talking \"in the back\" they decided to give me one room with 2 full beds for 4 adults. I'm 6'2\" and my son is 6'. I don't know how they expected us to fit in there. I finally arranged for the kids (both 18) to sleep over at a relative's living room. They also offered free internet during my stay (never happened) and a $75 credit towards food or drinks in the hotel (never happened either). At 7AM the next morning I was at the counter to get my 2 rooms and I was told that if someone checked out they would let me know...what???? I took a deep breath and went up to the regency club (I had reserved regency club rooms) for some coffee only that the key card would not allow me in. Went down again and another lady told me this time that they would give me 2 rooms on the east tower (not regency club), so I felt a little better. She changed my key and I got access to the regency club. After we got back to the hotel the gave us our rooms one of which was a suite the other a regular dbl bedroom. I will not exagerate when I tell you that I went through at least 20 different key cards. The would re-program them but they would not work, so they ended up sending security up with me to see if I didn't know how to open the door, I guess. And when they also couldn't, they would let me in te room. After they finally got it working for one room only (for the other it never worked, the kids had to enter through my room) then it would not work for the regency club, and so the cycle began all over again. The rooms are nothing special, not even the suite. It was big but that's about it. If you plan to be on vacation and sleep late, forget it. The hallways are so loud that you won't go to sleep early or sleep in late. You will hear absolutely everything happening in the hallways including the housekeeping calls at 8AM in every single room that does not have a privacy sign on it. The slit under the doors is so huge that you have to block the from your sight if light bothers you. I can go on about the rooms because a lot of things weren't up to par but I think you get the picture. On checkout, I was charged $10 more per night on the dbl bedroom. When I requested they fix it (I had my original reservation with me) they came up \"in the back room\" with the excuse that it was for the suite upgrade, although I knew and they knew that it was not the case.

One of the confusing things about that area of town is that below street-level is a whole nother street level where some buses run and where you have to go down to cross the bridge to the north side if you don't want to walk to Michigan. Had breakfast every morning at the Corner Bakery on Michigan and Wacker as cheaper than the hotel restaurant (although in the hotel lobby is a counter service coffee bar if all you want is a pastry and coffee). We didn't eat at any of the restaurants or called for room service. If you already have a reservation, self-service check-in is possible (which speeded up our check-in process quite a bit). Unfortunately, you can't specify additional criteria than what is in your original reservation, so we ended up in a non-smoking room on the 12th floor facing an office building. View rooms are more expensive. The rooms are decently appointed but with two full-size beds, a little tight for two people (with a person sitting at the desk, the other person can't get around the bed). Only two dresser draws and night stand drawer (as the other under counter space was taken up by mini-fridge and computer/keyboard). If you're the kind of person that unpacks into the dresser, you won't have a lot of drawer space. Lots of pillows (including a relatively thin bolster). Wi-fi access is available for $13+/day (completely outrageous). The bathroom is good-sized and yes, there is a public restroom toilet (another reviewer noted that as a negative...I just found it a little unusual). Water pressure was OK, not great, but the shower curtain was on one of those bent rods, so plenty of room to take a shower. Housekeeping was generally good, but a little inconsistent. Glasses were taken and not replaced twice (but when called, housekeeing brought replacement glasses within 5 minutes). Each day the bed was made slightly differently with a different number and location of pillows. First night we were there, we noticed one of the headboard lights didn't work. Electrician was in the room 30 minutes after I called and then figured it might be a circuit breaker. Light came on about 20 minutes after he left to check the breaker. Other than that, everything worked as expected. Good AC. We had several questions for the concierge over the course of our stay. All were answered accurately but with various degrees of helpful attitude. When we asked a bus question of the desk staff one night (as the concierge closes at 5), we were given a wrong answer that made for extra walking the next day. Self-service checkout was easy and although the system was a little pokey, still much quicker than waiting in line to check out in person. Altogether a pleasant stay in a very convenient location.

A number of people have complained about the location of the hotel. There is no perfect Chicago location for a hotel. It really depends on what you want to do while you are in Chicago. The hotel is not actually located on the Magnificient Mile but is very close to the south end of it, where Wacker Dr hits Michigan. It is literally a five minute walk from the hotel to the start of the Magnificient Mile. As is typical for any hotel in the Magnificient Mile area, it is not very convenient to the El. You will have to walk several blocks to any El station. If this is important to you, you should stay in the Loop area. It is one of the closest hotels to Navy Pier and within walking distance (about 10 minutes) unlike some hotels located on the north end of the Magnificient Mile area. My advice is to figure out what you want to do while you are in Chicago and then pick your hotel. The room itself is a typical chain hotel room. It was clean but nothing special and not extremely large or small. There was a nice flat screen tv in the room. The bathroom had a curved shower curtain bar and a nice water massage shower head. The toilet could have used an update. It looked like a toilet you would find in a high school bathroom. One other drawback is parking is $48 per night, unless you want to find a close by garage, park it yourself, and save a few bucks.

So we spent the whole trip worried that a rather large charge (we were staying many nights) would end up charging twice to our card. We were also given a discount on valet through AAA, the hotel at first knew about it, then had no idea, then knew again, then ended up charging us the full rate.

We had dinner reservations which is why there was a little more urgency in obtaining the towels. I ended up having to call 3 times and waited 50 minutes before they finally arrived. It wasn't the end of the world, but it did put me off for awhile. Overall, I loved the location of this hotel and the friendliness of the staff we encountered. We had breakfast in the restaurant 3 of 4 days and found very good. For the price we paid this was an absolute steal of a deal. If we paid twice as much I would still say it's a great hotel and I definitely recommend it to anyone. If I had to pay 3x as much, then I would say it may be a little to pricey.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Champaign, IL", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced, airport like hotel\u201d", "Author": "cubbieblue10", "ReviewID": "UR30531853", "Content": "I am stunned that this hotel is rated as four stars on Trip Advisor. Simply because a hotel charges an arm and a leg for a room does not make it four stars. I stayed here for two nights, not because of my decision but those who were traveling with me. To start, we spent 45 minutes in the lobby waiting to check in. The lobby is a very expansive atrium that reminds me of an airport ticketing hall. Guests were corralled through roped lines to check in at one of 3 open stations out of about 20 that were at the desk. The room is loud and packed with people - not a good way to start a \"relaxing\" trip. We stayed in the West tower. I cannot complain about the room, but also don't have anything great to say about it. It was about the size one would expect in a Chicago hotel, but I have seen better quality of furniture and materials in a HI Express. For the price you can do much better in the city. I had no issues during my stay until leaving. We called ahead to have our car (which was parked valet) brought around to the front. We were told it would be about 20 minutes. This was fine, as I understand they have a lot of people in the hotel and a lot of cars to move. However, after going downstairs 20 minutes later and not finding our car we were a bit miffed. We asked the valet if it was coming and he said yes, they were just behind. After waiting another 20 minutes we asked again and he had no record of the car being requested. They managed to get the car about 15 minutes later - more than an hour after being initially called. I think the valet service speaks to a lack of staffing at an enormous hotel (biggest in Chicago). If you are looking for a hotel where you feel like herded cattle - this is it. If you want a relaxing trip I would suggest looking elsewhere.

The rooms are completely removed from the lobby, so there was no noise in the bedroom from the atrium. For check-in, I only had to wait for 2 people ahead of me to complete their check-ins.

It was clear that it had not been laundered since the last child used it and urinated on it. The baby crib sheets also smelled of urine, so we got replacements. We disinfected the urine-stained baby crib mattress ourselves. - No hot water in our room -- We complained. A nice, helpful guy from \"engineering' came by and fixed it....for the night. By the next morning there was no hot water again. We had to run the water for 15 minutes for hot water to come through. - Mini-fridge didn't work -- They were nice enough to give a complimentary mini-fridge since we had a baby. Unfortunately it didn't cool very well; probably not lower than 50F, which isn't good enough for storing milk. I asked for a replacement mini-fridge but didn't let them take away the first because -- based on my experience thus far in the hotel -- I doubted the second one would work. Of course, the second one didn't work at all. Good thing we kept the semi-working first one. - Dilapidated facilities and room -- Regarding the sorry state of the hotel's facilities shown in other reviewers' photos, we experienced this too. There isn't a lot of care in this hotel, and it really shows. The hotel is aware of all of the problems -- the front desk fielded all of our complaints. However, they never did anything to compensate for them. They said they would 'take care of it right away' but any attempt to 'fix' an issue didn't work -- replacing one broken fridge with another broken fridge isn't helpful. Neither is fixing the hot water for just one night. I don't understand why the Hyatt would allow their brand to be associated with this hotel. Are they repositioning the brand to be a 2-star class? We got the room for a bid of $57/night on a well-known bidding site, but after all the issues I wouldn't consider this much of a \"deal\". If you can afford to stay at another hotel, I would strongly recommend that you do so. I wouldn't even stay here if I were attending a conference in this hotel. The Swissotel is connected by underground passageway; the Hotel Monaco and The Fairmont are close by. There are many hotels within walking distance that would be better places to stay.

It is within a few blocks of the elevated trains serving ORD and MDW, and is one block from several CTA bus stops. (The CTA transit passes and route map are great for tourists, and even include airport trains). The rooms are nicely decorated and the bedding is top quality. The bathroom is efficient. Even numbers above 16 in the west tower should give you a nice view of the river. What makes this hotel outstanding is the staff -- the best trained I have encountered anywhere, even better than at most 5 star hotels. First impressions are important, and the staff makes sure that one feels welcome from the moment one arrives. Granted the check-in may be scripted, but it is so pleasant that four weeks and two international trips later, I still remember the names of our receptionists (I booked several rooms as a gift for my wife and her girlfriends for a five day shopping and sightseeing trip, and our check-in was flawless). There are only two caveats when staying at this hotel: First, the climate control may be a problem. Most of our rooms were comfortable, but mine (on a separate floor) was quite chilly. When turned up, my thermostat made noise but no heat. Bring an indoor sweater or jacket in cool seasons. Second, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surcharges are unnecessarily high. For example, including taxes, parking is $50 per night (double the city parking rate at the nearby Randolph Street Millennium Park underground garage, and some guests even park at the airports or in the suburbs and take the train into the city); there is a $25 per night fee if you put any personal items in the mini-fridge; and internet usage is $15 per day extra. To me these rates seem hostile, and undo much of the good will the staff creates. However, any savvy traveler can avoid them. For example, Bockwinkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grocery is only half a block south of the hotel (on the street between the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two towers). There one can purchase an entire hot rotisserie chicken, a baguette, fresh fruit, and a bottle of basic wine for less than the Hyatt charges for two glasses of its ordinary house wine ($10 each). Perhaps the best part of our stay was the price. Because the hotel has a huge inventory of rooms, we were able to obtain a rate of $60 per room per night (plus taxes and fees) through bidding on Priceline. That rate makes this Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best hotel deal ever. Enjoy the Hyatt Regency Chicago, but watch out for those surcharges.

The 2nd floor has the bell desk, check-in, and concierge. If you have a room in the West Tower, there's a bridge to the right of the check in area. On the first floor of the East tower, there's a gift shop and a coffee/express shop for coffee, breakfast food, and snacks.

I would have jumped at the chance, but my schedule was hectic and I couldn't afford the time to unpack and repack and schlep back to the Hyatt for the second night. Because of their over-sold position, they had to put me in a smoking room (I didn't realize those still existed) for the first night. It reeked. My clothes still smell. As compensation they gave me a $100 Hyatt gift card which is probably fair, but all things considered, I would have much preferred to have gotten the non-smoking room I booked, and for which I prepaid, for 2 nights.

The walls are paper thin, but they put us at the end of a hallway, so there was less noise. We had a view overlooking Whacker Street and the Chicago River. Very nice! Didn't use the internet because it was $14 per day. Bed is large and comfy with LOTS of extra pillows. TV really sucked. Being in a town like Chicago didn't warrant a lot of time for T.V., but when we did want to use it, it was grainy and very user unfriendly. Prices - this is where they get you! Hotel parking was $48 per day. Wine at the bar was $9 per glass. Our lunch - salad and wine for me; half sandwich, soup, and 2 beers for hubby - was $55, not including tip! But, everything in Chicago is pricey, so you end up just sucking it up... Big Bar - super friendly. Never had an issue getting a cocktail. Daddy O's - once again, super friendly. I don't know how people can review that the hotel staff is unfriendly - we never experienced anything negative! Layout - took me a full day (and many wrong turns) to get to my conference rooms on time. There are 2 towers and multiple floors for conferences, so this was confusing. Some things we did that are worth mentioning: Bubba Gump Shrimp Company - fun and tasty! Walk along Navy Pier (cold in March, but neat) Cheesecake Factory - Yum, yum, yum!! Dublin's pub on Rush Street - found wonderful Hoegaarden beer. Field Museum - Sue, the largest T-Rex , is there Sears Tower - just a great view Shedd Aquarium - the Oceanarium was closed, but good place to visit overall (if you're a teacher, you can get in free!!!)

We booked on Hotwire and from my research I actually thought we would be in another property. I think we paid a good price but could have saved some more using Priceline. Hyatt Regency hotels are not designed for the budget traveler. Everything except the room itself costs extra and is grossly overpriced. For instance, internet access costs almost $14 for a day and parking is almost as much as the room. We got into trouble for using the minbar fridge for some of our own food and when we tried to access it in the morning, it had been locked remotely. We did get them to open it though. The staff are used to dealing with corporate travelers spending other people's money who don't care how much stuff costs, so any recommendations from the Concierge desk are suspect. The room itself was very nice with a great view up Michigan Avenue. The bed was comfortable; the sheets were good quality; the pillows were plump and the towels were thick and large. The bathroom could have been cleaner but I didn't notice it so I'm reporting what my wife said. The location is central as it sits right between the loop and the Magnificent Mile but if you don't like walking, you may feel that it is isolated. We lived well all weekend and did not spend an extra penny in the hotel. Here is how we did it. Some of the things we were prepared for; others we discovered by trial and error. For free internet access, there is a Corner Cafe at the intersection of Michigan and Whacker. There is also a Dominicks grocery store two blocks to the north on Columbus. If you are looking for it, you have to go down some stairs at the front of the hotels, drop-off area to access the street level below. They advertize Wifi there and I think it is free. They stay open until 1:00 am and have an excellent deli and lots of great bargains on wine if you sign up for their shopper card. We found these places on our own. The Concierge had no clue about budget travelling. We parked at Midway airport and took the CTA train to State and Lake, about four blocks from the hotel. If you had a lot of luggage, a cab would only be a few dollars but we walked it. You can get an online coupon from Parksavers for $9.00 a day and the CTA costs $2.25 or you can buy a 24-hour pass for $5.65 which we did on Saturday and it got us back to the car. Parksavers is right across the street from the CTA station. If you have been to Chicago before and done the downtown shopping and architecture admiration, we recommend getting on the CTA and exploring the neighborhoods. Lincoln Park, Wrigleyville are great. We especially loved wWcker Park which is on it's way up and still a little bit funky. You can also buy half price theater tickets online or at a booth downtown. We had a great time at an off-off broadway production. So, the Hyatt is a luxury hotel with great views and if you know how to work it, you can have a great weekend on a budget.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin , Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a great price\u201d", "Author": "IrishGirl15", "ReviewID": "UR26627896", "Content": "I booked this hotel via priceline.com and got a great deal for about $70 per night.

The location can't be beat, right next to the river and one block from Michigan Ave, perfect area. Although we got a great deal on the hotel, I would choose the Swissotel again, if the rates were similar. The beds in the Hyatt were extremely hard, so much so that my hips hurt in the mornings. The blankets on the bed consisted of one sheet and another thin blanket, I missed the down comforters that I'm used to in a hotel of this type. The walls were so thin that you could hear everything going on in the hallways, and even though we were on the 34th floor, we could hear traffic noise. The view we had was horrible, looked directly into an office building next door, so our curtains stayed completely closed whenever we were in the room. Breakfast buffet at Bistro 151 was good - great, even better because it was included in our rate. I loved the \"Big Bar\" a great place to meet friends, people everywhere, very bustling and fun, with good service. Friends of ours had an issue with check in, but our check in was speedy and friendly, although we had to ask for the breakfast buffet coupons, it didn't automatically show up on our ressie. Our friends issue was resolved to their satisfaction. The staff around the hotel were always very friendly stopping to say \"hello\" and ask if we needed help. Elevators were usually pretty quick, never had to wait for one, but being on the higher floor it made alot of stops while going down. High Speed internet cost $13 per day. I'd stay here again if the rate was as good, but I'd be certain to request better bedding and maybe a fan for the room to help block out some of the noise.

I was able to book the junior suite for $129 with a coupon found on www.travelzoo.com which included two free buffet breakfasts ($22 value each). The room was not as promising as it seemed via hotel research. The shower in the bathroom had drainage problems and flooded our floor. The ceiling had also been replaced which brings me to the conclusion that this wasn't just a problem in our room. To add to this, the craftsmanship of the replaced ceiling was not to hotel standard, seeing as it was a giant piece of drywall screwed into the top with the edges left visible. The vanity mirror looked as if it had once been ripped out of the wall and then screwed in above its original spot, seeing as there were several screws and holes below it that were painted over. The Hyatt Grand Bed was rock hard. The couch felt like it had been purchased from the clearance rack at Ikea. The hallway carpet needs to be revamped. Internet was $13.95 +tax per night. Outside of the room and wait staff, the hotel bar, \"The Big Bar\", was at mediocre at best. They serve 44oz martinis and 103oz beer towers, which sound intriguing, but expect to wait an hour, literally, to be served. Drinks were overpriced which is to be expected for a hotel bar, but you'd think that they'd have a wait staff that cared enough to come to your table instead of gossiping with others. After stating our case to the waitress, we were giving a free tower and more free breakfast vouchers. This set us a ease for the night, but still the wait was not acceptable.

In any case I went on a weekend (Feb. 19 -22 '09) shopping getaway with my mother (I'm in my mid 20's, she's in her mid 50's). We thought the location was indeed superb. Cab rides to Navy Pier or the Magnificent Mile cost us under 5 bucks and we walked when it wasn't too cold. The first room we got had a partial view of the lake up on the 21st floor but it was moldy and my mother couldn't handle it. The staff was very accomodating and moved us to another room. The next room was better in regards to smell and view but as I sat my purse down I noticed that the coffee table was filthy. It looked like someone spilled something on it and they only cleaned the glass so underneath the glass the residue was caked on - so gross. As far as the bathroom aesthetically speaking upon first glance it was nice. Upon closer inspection the counter/vanity although marble/granite was stained and so was the floor. The SINK oh goodness...washing our faces and brushing our teeth was an experience. The drain did not allow the water to go down properly so there was always residue - icky. Regarding the bed linen - I found a stain. Oh and the remote for the tv was sooooooo dirty. One more thing, for some reason it looked like the door had been forced open. It had evidence of forcible entry ( I don't know what that was about but I thought I'd add it to my comentary). There's more but my mother isn't around to speak on her observations. Wait, wait, wait...how could I forget the paper thin walls. I heard everything outside and the tv/conversations of the room beside us and everytime their toilet flush. WOW. The beds were pretty comfy. One thing we found strange was that I had a nice, warm duvet while my mother had a regular blacket on her bed. Overall though stay was fine. I would not give this place a four star rating. There might been other rooms that deserve the 4 stars but certainly not ours. There needs to be greater detail payed to cleaning the rooms. Seriously, people have to live in these rooms for a period of time so they need to be sanitary ( house keeping can help tremendously in that area). Other than my issue with the cleanliness which concerns the HK I think the staff was very nice, helpful and efficient. I can't say anything bad about them. About Hyatt corporate however I will say this...please, please, please invest some money into the adequate upkeep of this place. I know everyone is facing financial hardships but you have a reputation to maintain. Honestly, I don't think I would stay here again.

Nearby I was able to find a lot for $35/24 hours. I'm sure there are cheaper options if one is willing to walk further.

Modern, clean for the most part, and comfortable. Huge flat screen TV, two beds, one easy chair, one additional chair and a desk chair with wheels. The bathroom was spacious; however the counter space was somewhat limited. My only complaint about the room was the hot/cold water situation. Often there was no sufficient hot water in the morning for showers. In the evening there was no cold water, hot water came out of both taps, even the cold. The fix for this was to run the bath tub on cold and let the extreme hot water drain off. Even the toilet pipes were piping hot during the evenings. Strange situation. The hot water in the morning was adequate, but not as hot as I would have liked. The hotel itself is huge with over 2000 rooms, countless meeting rooms and several massive conference/convention rooms. The hotel is divided into east & west towers with indoor connecting a connecting bridge on floor 2 and tunnel on floor -1. Check-in is located on the second level with several food options on the lower level. Nothing at this hotel is inexpensive. The coffee bar, second floor bar, steak house, lobby restaurant are all very expensive. There is not a lot in the immediate area, but lots of options if one is willing to walk 10 minutes away. There is a good convience store/market behind the hotel. Prices there are reasonable for water, alcohol, snacks. The business center charges offensive rates for internet use: $7.50 per 15 minutes and $0.75 per page if one wishes to print. That said, free airline check-in and boarding pass printing is available at the conceirge desk on the second level. There are also internet terminals across from the lobby coffee shop on the first level which may be a cheaper option. As other reviewers have stated, there is a lot of noise that can be heard.

Even with the ear plugs in that I brought, I was awoken the first day by noise in the hall: a first for me when traveling. Usually in northern hotels in the winter I find the hotel rooms very, very dry. Somehow this hotel has solved this problem. The air was always very moist. I'm not sure how they do this on such a massive scale, but I certainly appreciated it. The air always smelt 'fresh' and always had a pleasant smell. I can't say enough about the staff at this hotel. They are trained well. Everyone I encountered went out of their way to be pleasant, say \"hi\", and ask if there was anything they could do. I saw one employee walking by an open elevator door stop and place their arm in the closing doors so a couple could make it on before the doors closed.

All in all, the walls are a little thin, but we had a corner room so it was not that bad. The staff was very nice and helpful. I was impressed with the computers at the concierge which are able to print your boarding passes. That was a nice treat. Also, they have really good Starbucks hot cocoa for a good price as well. :)Enjoy your stay!

And I asked to be up high, so they put me on the 25th floor with a lake view. The staff was really nice. But I was disappointed in the hotel itself. My room was artsy and attractive, but the walls were extremely thin. I could hear normal conversations in the rooms on either side and also in the hallway quite loudly. In fact the entire hotel is very loud. Usually in a 4-star place there are options for quiet, like at least one classy upscale restaurant in which to have a fine meal. Not here. The finest on-site restaurant is the Chop House, which had a noisy crowd. The atrium has another restaurant, a bistro, and a bar, but the cavernous space makes everything sound like Disneyland. The only other small restaurant is Pronto Mama's, where the deli cases and fridges hum at a frighteningly high volume and the loud overhead music can't be turned down (I asked, the waiter was helpful but apparently the volume is fixed). So the meal was accompanied by Volare and Frank Sinatra blasting overhead. But then let's talk about the food. I ordered grilled salmon on a bed of pesto pasta. The pasta, instead of being lightly tossed with pesto was drenched in it, with cheese so thick the pasta glommed together, all swimming in an olive oil soup. The salmon was so coated in pepper that my mouth burned -- there was no warning on the menu that this dish would be spicy or \"picante,\" plus it's pretty hard to mess up salmon -- but that's what they did. Note that they also nickle and dime you at this hotel with extra charges such as high-speed internet for the exhorbitant rate of $16 per day. If you want a room that's *visually* attractive but you don't mind paper thin walls and you plan to eat elsewhere, this hotel would be fine. But I wouldn't call it 4-star, and I don't think the price is worth what you get.

I was able to get unusually cheap rate ($95 per night) for the downtown area by booking the hyatt.com non-refundable internet rate. Once I booked the hotel, I came to this site and read the reviews and immediately became concerned from all the negative comments. I have stayed at this hotel once before but about five years ago after the renovation. I called the hotel and told them I was concerned about the quality of my stay after reading multiple negative reviews on various sites. At that time, the gentleman I spoke to upgraded me to a Deluxe King room with a view. Upon arriving, I didn't have any problem with check-in at the hotel as it went fairly quickly and without a hitch. As far as the room it was spacious and clean. The bathroom was clean but not that large and there was nothing fancy about it. Also on our second evening there, we got ready to shower and head out for the night only to find there was no hot water. The highlight of this room was the upgraded room. We we on the 26th floor with an awesome view of the Chicago River and Michigan Avenue. After getting over the cold water obstacle on our second night, we headed downstairs to hit the town. I already had the address in hand but needed directions. The concierge desk was closed but I figured it would be no big deal to either use one of the computers in the business center or ask one of the front desk clerks to mapquest directions for me (Other hotels have done this before). The business center was closed and the front desk clerk told me they didn't have access to the internet to look up directions for me. I went outside and asked one of the valets for directions and none of them could provide any either. That was quite a bit irritating. You would think at minimum the hotel could provide a 24-hour business center or free wifi services in the rooms. I didn't bother bringing my laptop with me because of the ridiculous daily rate they charge for internet service. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Regency. However, this is a 4-star hotel and the average rate is around $250 per night. I would never pay that rate to stay at this hotel. I can name at least ten others in the downtown vicinity that offer a better rate and better accomodations. While the room was clean, it was a bit dull and drab and you can tell that this hotel is in need of some updating and renovations. The walls were also paper thin. You could hear everything from your next door neighbors conversation to late night party-goers ending their nights loudly in the hallways. Next issue is with parking, I understand that I am downtown and a lot of the hotels charge a similar rate but to me $48 per night is so ridiculous especially when you add this on to the average rate for these hotels. To sum things up. Positives: - If you are lucky enough to get a room with a view - If you are lucky enough to find a decent internet rate. Negatives: - Rooms need renovations - Bathroom are not up to par - For the price internet service should be free - No refrigerators/microwaves in the rooms - No soda machines in the hallways, you are forced to pay $5.00 for a soda or water out of the mini-bar - Paper thin walls. We were constantly interrupted/awakened by outside noise - Trouble with hot water For a hotel of this calibur I would expect a whole lot more. Again, I wouldn't stay unless I got a good internet rate or booked on Priceline.

Most of the reviews of this hotel are spot on - it is exactly like staying at the airport and I don't mean like staying at an airport hotel, it is like staying in the middle of the terminal! The lobby is really crowded and noisy no matter what time you pass through. The service is very impersonal and when we complained about not getting the room we reserved and about our less than clean room, they responded as if they were reading from a script and could have cared less that we were unhappy. It was like they had heard it all before. The other reviews were also correct about the noise - you can hear everything in this hotel including your neighbors potty flushing in the middle of the night. Thankfully, we were at the end of the hall so we didn't have to hear people passing by our room to go to the elevator but I can only imagine what others must have heard. If you stay in the East Tower on the backside (as we did) be aware - there is a fire station across the street and they literally had calls in the wee hours of the morning every night we were there. There are not enough restaurants in the hotel to handle the number of people staying there. The lines are long, the food is expensive and not great. Hope that your conference is feeding you lunch (mine did not) or you won't have time to eat and get back to the afternoon sessions if you try to eat at the hotel due to the long lines and slow service. There was only one real restaurant serving lunch. There also are not enough elevators - we spent many times waiting 10 minutes for an elevator or having to pass up two or three elevators in a row because they were too full by the time they got to our floor.

There was a large group of us going to Chicago for a work event and I found a great rate through Travel Zoo. I believe we booked 8 rooms. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt a few years back during the Christmas holidays and had a so so stay so I was hoping for a better stay this time. Upon check in my husband opted for a nicer suite and paid $20/more per night. I think the bonus was the view out the window and going up to the hospitality room which wasn't really all that great since you had to pay for liquor (honor bar). I think juices and coffee/tea was free. The room was fine. Nothing to blog/brag about. I will say that the lobby area can be a crazy zoo. I think on the weekend nights it turns into a night club. I didn't experience it but that's what people told me. I will say what was horrible was all the Philly fans who were staying at the hotel. My husband is born and bred Chicagoan and was wearing a Bears jersey. He walked by the bar and had 500 people booing him. It was all fun though b/c we didn't care. Must have sucked for all those people to come out to Chicago and lose. Oh well for them. Anyways what made the stay horrible: $48 valet. If you stay overnight at the hotel, you have to pay $48. There is no self park. There is a parking lot close by for $30 but you have to walk a distance and what's the point. It's not really the cost that kills me. It does kill me but when you have horrible service and are paying that much, it's a real dupe. At that price I would expect the customer service to be outstanding. It wasn't. My husband had called down one morning to get the car because he had to be somewhere for work. He called about 15 minutes ahead. Once he got to the valet stand, it took another 20 minutes on top of his 15 minutes warning to pull up the car for the car to come. He ran late for his work event. Horrible. Then they mixed up our tickets when we were leaving for the airport to leave Chicago for home. 2nd really horrible thing: On the Saturday evening, my husband went out with his coworkers. I decided to stay in and just watch some tv. At about 11pm I heard a lot of noise in the hallway but didn't think much of it. It wasn't crazy but it was loud. At about 11:30pm I realized I hadn't put on the do not disturb sign. So I opened up my door to put the sign on the handle and a water bottle that was leaning on my door tipped over into my room spilling liquid on the carpet. The liquid hit my feet and I was startled being half asleep. I picked up the water bottle and felt that it was a bit warm and then looked at the liquid and it was yellow. Someone had urinated in a water bottle and left it leaning on my door. I called the manager on duty and they apologized and then sent up security to clean up the mess. Security came and cleaned up but they didn't even put any effort into cleaning up the spill. They took the bottle and then wiped the carpet using their shoes and sprayed some cleaning agent all around the area. The room smelled like chemicals. I can't believe that all I got was a sorry and some chemicals. Obviously the Hyatt doesn't care about repeat customers. I told my husband and he was furious. He complained at front desk. They said they could not find out who did it because there were no surveillance cameras up there. They said it was an invasion of privacy. Somehow I don't believe it. I am just going to say that the 2 times at the Hyatt it has not been great stays. We've stayed at so many hotels in downtown Chicago.

Our taxi dropped us off at the east tower. Inside, the lobby was immensely busy. The reviewers that likened this to an airport terminal are right on. We rode the escalator up to the 2nd level, where fortunately there were no lines wating for registration. They offered we could upgrade to a river view room with king bed. Neither were available when I reserved a room before our trip. The special conference rates were booked up so we paid $300/night for the river view room. Our room was located across the street in the west tower, which we accessed through the skywalk. Although a bit tired looking, the room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, riverwalk, etc. The bathtub/shower combo didn't have any mold but a few tiles needed to be regrouted. The toilet was quite unexpected for this grade of hotel. It's nothing more than the standard tankless industrial toilet with metal flush lever. (think airport restroom - I guess it matches the hotel airport lobby!) While the toilet was certainly functional, the real problem is that the flush lever is back behind the toilet, hidden beneath and behind the built in facial tissue bin - forcing you to become a bit of a contortionist to simply try and flush the thing. The bathroom also has no exhaust fan, which creates a hot sauna after your shower. The air conditioning / heating system is radiant and was covered by the built in valance over the window. We never got the temperature right for us in the room and wished there would have been a whooshing noise from a fan to mask the noise from the room next door and the hallway. The air circulation from a fan would have been nice also. Another problem was there was a big gap underneath the room door, making it impossible to keep out the cigarette smoke on our \"nonsmoking\" floor. The person in the room next to us smoked worse than a chimney. It was disgusting but they were allowed to continue. We had plenty of hot water but they were quite skimpy with toiletries and amenities. We were given only one small bar of bath soap to last 3 nights; no shower cap, mending kit or any of the little extras even some cheap hotels provide. None of the hotel restaurants were open for dinner our first two nights there. Breakfast buffet in the lobby bistro was $22, food was very good. For something quick 24/7, there's an express market in the lobby where you can buy snacks, drinks, prepared food, etc., with a microwave and toaster to prepare what you buy. We ordered room service for breakfast one morning. the food was okay - mind you - breakfast is served only in the east lobby restaurant so by the time they got it across the street and up to our room, it was only lukewarm. We do not have subways and such where we live and are not used to walking in tunnels underneath buildings. It would have been greatly helpful if the Hyatt had maps or brochures in the rooms explaining their tunnel system. There is a skywalk connecting the east and west hotel towers. Once you're in the west tower you can go down to the Bronze level (take elevator to 1st floor, escalator down to Bronze) and walk through that tunnel to the Illinois Center. You'll find a small grocery store, shops and restaurants. We ate at Houlihan's, accessed through the tunnel or Wacker street, since the hotel restaurants were closed. There is also a great little grocery store called Brookwinkles, just one block south of the hotel on Stetson (the street separating the east and west towers). Hotel parking is $48/night. Internet is $14/day. If you use the computer in their Cyber Cafe, be prepared to pay $28/hour. The hotel is located near the south end of the Miracle Mile, so it's a bit of a walk to all the shopping. Tiffany's and Macy's is about two miles walk roundtrip. The hotel has a courtesy shuttle from the east Tower/Lobby to the Navy Pier. Their customer service was outstanding. One nice feature was being able to print our boarding tickets from their special courtesy terminals (located in the concierge area in the east lobby). I might stay here again on a business trip, especially if the conference is in the same hotel. Otherwise, for a personal trip, I'd probably opt for a quieter hotel elsewhere.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cOkay\u201d", "Author": "Shaytmg", "ReviewID": "UR20372490", "Content": "I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago and our stay at the Hyatt was just ok after three separate rooms.

Unfortunately our room was not ready, but the person behind the desk said that we were going to be put in a room with a lake view. Within a half hour they called me to say the room was ready, but we did not come back to the hotel until mid afternoon. We assumed that a room was reserved for us, but unfortunately there were no lake view rooms left. We were given three different rooms, one with a view of the lobby, one which backed on to the service elevator shaft and was very loud, and a suite with the same elevator problem. Luckily the service elevators don't run at night. We ended up staying in the suite they gave us which was large and had a nice sitting area and wet bar. Although, listening to the elevator woosh by every minute or two was very annoying. The layout is very strange and it looks like the building was converted to a hotel at some time. Our large suite had only a stall shower and the closet was in the bathroom. The location was great though. It was right on the river and near the Miracle Mile.

I had stayed here several years before and I loved it but this time, not so much. The room was strange because it had been updated but still looked old, it's hard to explain it. I think it was because even with all the lights on it was still on the darkish side. The floor was not flat - it had a few large bumps and dips under the carpet, which was surprising and strange. And there was a large enough gap under my door into the hallway that I could clearly see daylight and shadows when people passed by. I would guess I could have fit my whole hand (flat) out the gap up to my wrist. These things made me wonder if there was a structural concern. As I like my room cool, I went immediately to the thermostat to crank it down low, and I looked around and could not see any vents - there was though a large duct that went across the ceiling in front of the window (they backlit the duct which was smart, otherwise it would have been unsightly, but even backlit, it's pushing it), and I have to say I had low expectations here but the room did cool off. If you are someone who likes \"white noise\" or the whirr of an AC unit, don't expect that here...I have to say the climate unit was silent. Speaking of noise though, you hear EVERYTHING here - doors slamming, toilets flushing, etc. I had to quickly shower and run out to a dinner, and when I went into the bathroom, that is where the problems began. The toilet was one of those industrial ones with no tank and just a lever. I don't care about that but I was surprised, for a Hyatt Regency. Next, there was no hot water. I let it run for a good 5 minutes and then since I was in a hurry, I called the front desk and they seemed unconcerned, they asked me if I had \"let the water run 10-15 minutes\" and I said no, I was hoping for immediate hot water. The lady was apologetic and said they could send someone up, and I said fine but that I had to leave, so they could come in and take a look in my absence (wasn't crazy about that but what choice did I have?). Then I went to grab a towel and take my luke warm (at best) shower. Well...the towel had a long black hair going down it's entire length and I cringed. So I threw that one on the floor and grabbed another one and this one had part of a fake eyelash on it. I was beginning to freak out now, being a germaphobe as it is. The last towel seemed acceptable and I had to use it, but trust me, I used it sparingly. I promptly called the front desk back (this is SO unlike me but that was the last straw) and the lady said they would have 2 sets of clean towels sent up, she was very apologetic. If I had more time I would have just asked her to please get me a new room. Once those things were ironed out, my stay was fine, nothing great, but no more issues arose. The water was hot the rest of my stay and I have to say the staff was very receptive and nice, from check-in to the above-mentioned issues. The only other thing is that I would have liked more outlets...I needed to iron each day and the only plug that I could find that was in easy reach was in the bathroom and it was very awkward ironing in the little foyer outside the bathroom. Beautiful flat screen TV - loved it. The beds were average - coworkers of mine also staying in the hotel said the sheets were not big enough for the bed and their feet were against mattress, and hence they had to remake their beds. Luckily mine was not short-sheeted. I did not use any of the amenities of the hotel. The multi-story lobby was OK. Overall, I would say this hotel is in a great location but needs to be upgraded in a few major ways including bathrooms, bedding, and just general upkeep. I would stay again on business travel I suppose, but certainly not on personal travel, as it is pricey and I would certainly expect more for my money.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cUnnecessarily unaccomodating\u201d", "Author": "brcor8", "ReviewID": "UR20270928", "Content": "I have had a stressful experience at this hotel.

OK, so they want to have shops and restaurant on the floor where you arrive, but we had a room in the West Tower and every time we returned to the hotel it was to have to go up the escalator, through the crowd at reception, and then take the walkway to the West Tower. In the room the poor design continued - just two 18\" x 18\" drawers for my wife and I to unpack our belongings for a four day stay - I object to living out of my suitcase at the price they charge.... - the bathroom has a small shelf round the sink which does not have enough space for 2 washkits and a make-up bag. It gets worse! The toilet has a small shelf above it with the flush handle set back under the shelf - if you have a bad back as I do then expect to have to drop to your knees every time you want to flush.... And worse still! The container for the bathroom tissues is set into the side of the shelf above the toilet bowl so when the lid or seat is lifted they lean against the tissue box - obviously the bathroom designer was lacking in basic hygiene knowledge!

Check in at 4pm on a Friday, in the busiest lobby we've ever seen, was quick and efficient, although a long wait for an elevator. Our initial King room, at the end of a hallway, was strangely shaped (like a squished trapezoid) with the bed squeezed in at an odd angle. We're not terribly picky but it was not a happy space or a relaxing room. Since we booked through Priceline, I wasn't sure we'd be able to switch, but a call to the front desk offered a new room on the same floor, this one with two double beds, but with the caveat that they had no bellman to move us. A trip down and back up landed us a room across from a very loud malfunctioning ice machine -- but the room's size muted the noise (and we had a Priceline rate so we knew we were not going to get a choice room). We are sound sleepers so the noise wasn't a big deal but, man, it was LOUD, especially with the late night tipplers staggering back to their rooms in the wee hours. If the Hyatt can afford 36\" plasma TVs, surely they could afford a 2\" strip at the bottom of the door to block some of the noise that comes through the large space between bottom of door and floor. Our room was standard Hyatt decor: pretty, yet it had clearly had seen a lot of traffic. We were greeted by name in every phone call and desk encounter, and a room service clerk was especially courteous and observed all standard gender protocol (requesting permission to enter the room, opening the deadbolt so the door did not fully close/latch when he was in the room) when the female member of our couple ordered room service alone in the room one evening. Some may think this old-fashioned, but it was appreciated. We expect expensive room service, but at $25 for a veggie wrap and a soda, it was disappointing the sandwich was tough and unpleasant and did not taste fresh. We've typically had much higher quality room service meals at other Hyatts. The Fitness Center is located inconveniently in a tunnel connecting the two wings of the buildings, in a passageway it shares with an Indian restaurant. The hallway outside the fitness center reeked of cigar smoke to the extent that we didn't bother going in.

Then someone used it and it really made noise. I asked to be moved because of the ice machine and street noise. I lugged my luggage back to the lobby, across the hotel to the other tower to my new upgraded room on the quiet \"club\" level. They left out the part that club amenities were extra (which I can understand but at least inform the customer when you are playing up the \"club level\" part). This upgraded room was missing a remote control for the tv, no pen on the desk, no paper. Since I heard turn-down service going from door to door I waited patiently and then realized \"no turn-down service\" for us upgraded people. So I had to call the desk to bring these items. Then I heard room service pounding on someone's door at 12:30am. I have gotten room service that late myself but they are usually quiet about it as some people might be sleeping (but not in this hotel!)

I told them it was security making all the noise yelling in the hall at 1:30 am. I never heard anyone but security and their radios turned way up making noise. The next day the manager asked what he could do to make it up to me. I said that club level amenities would be nice and he seemed to agree. You guessed it - never got anything!

It was one of six \"official\" hotels for the convention. I paid way too much per night for what I got and I am not happy about that. I most likely won't stay there again. The lobby was busy from the jump, but I expected that so that was no problem. There were other conventions/conferences in town so that was cool. A woman who worked there helped me check into our room via the express check-in kiosk, which was very efficient. I appreciated her help. Check-out was efficient, too, using that kiosk. Before I even entered my room, however, I noticed chipped paint on the door, which signaled a place in need of repair. I wasn't prepared for that since the pics on the Web site showed an updated, maintained room. My suspicions about the room were confirmed upon walking in. Just want you to know that the rooms are old with feeble attempts to make them look modern. The view wasn't great and I wasn't feeling a number of things, including the dim lighting in the bathroom (which remained, even after I complained to the front desk about it), the lack of real counter space in the bathroom, a lack of an exhaust fan in the bathroom, a coffee maker that allows you to make a single cup of coffee or tea one at a time, paper cups for the coffee or tea, and the fact that you can hear way more noise from your neighbors than you really want to. My roommate complained that she heard way too much of a conversation between two women who were in their hotel room. So much for privacy. The lamp shades were awful. One nightstand lamp was scratched up and paint was missing. The alarm clock held up the lamp shade before I moved it. And the lamp shade of the floor lamp near my roommate's bed was old and caved in. It didn't even give off a good light. The drawer space was awful, so don't bring a lot of clothes unless you plan on putting some of them on the floor or leaving them in your suitcase. The hair dryer was on the closet shelf, as if it was an afterthought. Why wasn't it in the bathroom where it belonged is beyond me. The cable stations seriously lack variety, which I didn't expect. I should be able to at least watch HGTV and Bravo. Yes, I expected that for what I paid to stay there. Truly, the highlights of the room were the iHome alarm clock that allowed me to dock my iPod, the very comfortable beds and a nice, powerful shower. I also enjoyed the coffee downstairs that I bought at J's. One good thing is that the hotel is close to many good restaurants, Magnificent Mile, the Navy Pier and so much more. Just a warning: Avoid ordering room service if you can. I paid $43 dollars for two orders of wings and an order of fries. If you do order in, count on paying taxes, gratuity and a delivery service charge. My $30 or so order skyrocketed in no time with all those charges added. I don't have a problem with paying taxes or gratuity. But when folks start adding a service charge on top of the gratuity, it's just suspect. Case in point: Eat out whenever you can and bring it back to your room. This place is ok if you want a good shower, a comfortable bed and access to the best that Chicago has to offer. But keep in mind that you're paying for all that, perhaps more than you may want to. They aren't doing you any favors. If this were the Motel 6, it would have been great.

Bad Qualities: The most glaring issue is the extensive mold in the tub/shower. In fact, it was so disgusting that I didn't want to put the soap down in the bathroom. There was an outlet cover in the bathroom that was hanging on by a thread which immediately fell down when I closed the door. Spider webs covered the sprinklers. Multiple holes were in the wall. The beds were rather hard and uncomfortable. The toiletries were cheap. And the most annoying issue with the hotel was that we could not cool down the room!

This seems to be a growing cost saving trend with high end hotels these days which in my opinion is deceptive. Good Qualities: There were tons of pillows! The food was reasonably priced.

The location is decent, between the park and the shopping district. While this hotel is not horrible, I don't plan on staying here again unless they considerable improve their attention to detail.

As stated this is a very big and very busy convention hotel, and I suspect the main lobby is seldom quiet. However, we found the hotel to be pleasant overall. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning as our flight arrived early. The nice young man at the desk attempted to find us a room (this was at 8:45am) that was ready but was unable to do so. He advised that our cell phone would be called as soon as one was ready so we checked our bags with the bell stand and went out to have breakfast. Later in the morning, about 1100, our room was ready. As we were waiting on the elevator in the lobby the same desk clerk walked by, remembered our names, and asked which room we had been assigned. We told him our room and he was very pleased and said he had wanted to get us in that room, which was a corner view room. Nice service and gave a food first impression of the hotel. Our room was in the west tower on a high floor and had a great view of the river and downtown Chicago. The room had a king sized bed and was in good shape and seemed to be very clean. The housekeeping staff kept it that way our whole visit. The only thing I would fault the room for was the lack of a fridge we could use for own things. There is a mini-bar but we were warned that if we moved anything to make room for our own items we would be charged for it (electronic monitor of the goods). So we just left the mini-bar alone and used ice from ice machine to ice down things. The room also had an electronic safe which is a nice touch. Overall we happy with the room, the location, and the housekeeping. Location of the hotel is good for access to all the attractions of downtown Chicago. We did not have a car so no parking fee issues for us, but I would hate to pay the rates they wanted. We only had one meal in the hotel, lunch one day at Bistro 151.

The front desk service was friendly but a couple of times we were steered in the wrong direction for services by the bell desk and whoever was manning the phones. The hotel decor looks cheap and is poorly designed, both aesthetically and ergonomically. Our room wasn't very clean to start with (dust on the radio and woodwork), but the daily maid service wasn't the greatest either - our beds were haphazardly thrown together with a pillow left on the floor. And the beds are doubles rather than queens. One of the beds' linens had holes in it. Valet parking is really expensive at $48 a day, especially for a hotel of this caliber. Another annoyance is that you can't park your own car, so you feel obligated to tip in addition to paying the daily rate. They nickle and dime you with internet charges and mini-bar usage charges, as other reviewers have noted. On the plus side, the location is really convenient and the view from our room was beautiful, overlooking the river with views to Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. I can think of no other reasons why I would want to stay at this hotel ever again. There are so many other lovely hotels in the area.

I commute to Chicago every week and have done so for the past year and a half. I've stayed in dozens of different hotels. My room was a queen and very small. The staff person who helped me use the kiosk check-in devices knew that and mentionned it to me as soon as he saw the room number. \"Yes, it's not the king you were hoping for and the room is smaller than most, it does have a great view.\" The view was decent - a partial shot of the Chicago River and many other high rises - but not great. I guess I shouldn't complain though. I booked through Hotwire and got a very reasonable price, so it's not unexpected that I wouldn't get an \"A\" room. On other trips I received rooms that were quite spectacular. I guess it depends on the occupancy. The room was comfortable and clean. Only a stand up shower, so if you are a bath person, make sure you ask when you check in. I do not eat or drink in any of the restaurants at the Hyatt. They are very expensive and the food is only average at best. There are many close by restaurants that guests can walk to that have better food and are more reasonably priced. I was only there for one night this trip so I didn't use any of the other ammenities. The new check in kiosks actually took longer to use then stepping up to the counter, but that could have been \"user error\". I'm guessing when the lines are long the kiosks will be a welcome opportunity to check in, and as I get more proficcient, the processing will be faster. As mentionned, there was a staff person there assisting. he was very helpful and knowledgeable. Two pet peeves about this hotel - no free wifi and they won't let you use your frequent stay number if you book through Hotwire. I get why they do that and don't expect credit for a discounted room, but at least by using your number, you could get a free paper in the morning and at least be recognized as a Gold Passport member.

We were travelling with work and the costs did not come out of our pocket. If they had, we would have found some prices high. Wireless internet is $14/day; room service is $3.50 delivery fee plus 15% mandatory gratuity plus inflated meal prices. If you are travelling for pleasure and can forego internet and room service, I recommend the Hyatt Regency. Here's why: 1. Fabulous location. It is right in between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. Easy walk to Navy Pier, Millenium Park, Art Institute, Macy's, waterfront, river tours, and TONS of restaurants. 2. Comfortable and clean beds, linens, and rooms (pictures already posted by others reflect our room and bathroom very well). 3. Free gym. The gym is rather small but it has bikes, ellipticals, weights (free and machine) televisions, and treadmills. 4. Great concierge service - always friendly, always available. TIPS FOR TRAVELLERS: 1. Ask for an upper floor room - you will get a good view of either downtown, the Mag Mile, the river, or the lake. 2. Ask for a fridge.

We were in the East Tower (the main one) on the 33rd floor with a view of the Chicago River and a peak at the lake. It was gorgeous, and we enjoyed coming back to our room each night to enjoy the view when it was all lit up. We had a king room and, while it was not very big, it was certainly adequate for what we needed. The bathroom was a nice size with lovely amenities. There's a coffee bar in the lobby that serves Starbucks, and you can get pastry, fruit, etc. is you're on the run. If you walk out of the hotel and turn left and go about a block and a half straight, there's a Corner Bakery that is great and inexpensive for breakfast. Anything from pastries to full breakfasts. The Hyatt Regency is in an excellent location for sightseeing. We were only about 2 blocks from the Mag Mile, and we walked to the Art Institute, Millenium Park and several other places. Cabs are easy to find, so for $5.00 or so, you can cab it if it's too far to walk. My only criticism of the Hyatt is that there is virtually no drawer space in the room. They stuck a makeshift, small chest in the closet, but if you have a lot of clothes that you want to unpack, there's almost no place to put them unless you hang them in the closet.

We have our meetings at the site of our upcoming (October) annual conference. Therefore, we were designated as \"VIP's\", which may mean that the overwhelmingly attentive customer service I received may not reflect the experience of the average guest. October will tell the tale; I'm sure that we won't be VIP status, since our group will number about 3,500 or so...we'll just be regular guests. All the same, I was really ambivalent about my stay based on the TA reviews I had read. My experiece was a good one. Our room was really nice--very comfortable bed, and I enjoyed having an LCD TV to watch. We were on the 30th floor with wonderful view of the river, the Hancock Tower, etc. We thought the water pressure might be an issue, given the way the sink flowed, but the shower turned out to be just fine. Internet access was plenty fast, but too pricey (almost $14/day...but I had it free for this visit). Customer service was very good---but keep in mind the VIP thing. When they called to tell us our second room was ready (we were given an adjoining suite/living/dining room w/bar, couches, etc), my wife went down to get the key. Because the reservation was made by my organization, she wasn't listed....so they wouldn't give her the key. However, the customer-service agent in the lobby came up with her to verify that she was my wife. Everytime I called someone on the phone, they used my name. So, overall, very good customer service. It's a little thing, but I really liked being able to print my boarding pass--no charge--at the concierge's desk. Prices at the coffee shop, etc.---forget it. Outrageous ripoff. Location--can't beat it. Easy walking access to both ends of the Maginificent Mile, the Pier, etc. Only a few blocks from the State/Lake CTA stop, from which you can catch the Orange Line straight to Midway...for $2.00.

We requested a king room when booking, but we were told they could not guarantee one would be available. When we got there, we were told they were out of king rooms and we could request one in the morning and move. I called late morning and was told they still did not have one available, but probably would later in the day. I was told the request for a king room was noted on my account and they would call and leave a message later in the day when one was available. When I returned to the room later that day, there was no message, so I called the front desk again. She put me through to an asst. manager and I wanted to know the status of my request. He told me he did not see a request on my account. I told him I had talked to 2 different people about this and was told it was on my account. He asked who I had talked to, and that irritates me. I do not think it should be my responsibility to document my conversations with staff and I also feel like you think I'm making this up when you ask me to document my conversations. I do not expect this kind of \"service\" from a hotel of this caliber. They did have a king room available, but I should not have had to go through this to get one. If you want to park at the hotel, it is up to $45 per night, so keep that in mind when booking the room. There is other parking available for about $20 a night, but it is 5 blocks away. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. They have 40\" flat TV's in the room, but the picture is not in HD. Again, for the price, couldn't we have HD TV?

Too much work the night before. We look for the shuttle. It cost twice as much tas a cab but after the BS from the night before, we were glad to get the hell away from this place.

The good news on the hotel is that it has a large variety of well appointed rooms. Bad news is that you have no idea what room type you are going to get until you get there. This is fine if you get there early in the day and are flexible in the room type you can use, however if you are particular this can drive you nuts. For us this was painful since we were there as a family and we really needed to have a room which we could have a roll away in. Last year everything went well and we actually got a king size bed wih a sleeper sofa (the front desk didn't know that it was a sleeper sofa, however what we found out from maid service is that most of the sofas are sleeper sofas even though the front desk doesn't know this). This year we arrived later and they offered us either a queen size bed or a king size bed without sleeper sofa. They suggested that we get the queen size bed since it would have more room for the roll away so we tried this. Unfortunately when we got up to the room we found a square table next to the bed which while nice if I was by myself, completely blocked access for a roll away. After many conversations with the front desk and the assistant manager I was able to get this corrected (and actually got a upgrade to a really nice room), however it took forever and frankly I think we just got lucky. Others in our group didn't get this lucky. So.... if room type matters definately get there early in the day or book at a different hotel which lets you select the room type. Other big issue at this hotel is the elevators. Especially when the hotel is full, getting a elevator is extremely painful!! Best advise is always give yourself 10 to 20 minutes to get a elevator; press both the up and down arrows; be willing to crush yourself into the elevator; and if you are on a lower floor be ready to walk down the stairs.

The 2nd time, I was expecting the same spacious room, and was offered a Queen sized bed. Room turned out to be smaller than any other Hyatt room I've stayed at.... I guess since they gave me a room with an excellent view, they may have felt justified in reducing the size of the room.

I was pleased to be given a deluxe King on the 29th floor of the West Tower with an absolutely stunning view of the river and the lake. The room-size is what one would expect for an urban hotel, but I must admit the designers were quite clever in making this room \"workable\". The headboard served as a low room divider with a nice desk area behind it near the window. I very much enjoyed sitting at this desk and watching the traffic along the river. There is a small table on coasters that slides beneath the desk allowing for additional work space. I also wheeled this table around and near the bed to hold room service while watching television. There is a nice comfortable easy chair with ottoman, an additional table, and two very small extensions of the headboard that serve as bedside \"tables\". The small round table by the easy chair held a living bamboo plant. The in-room safe had problems and I complained to the front desk who connected me to security. A young man came up immediately and worked for a long time to fix the problem, without success. He told me that someone would be up the next day and asked me for a convenient time. When no one had arrived a half hour after the desginated time I called again and someone immediately responded who worked a long while before calling for his supervisor. It was determinied that a new faceplate was needed. The repair was made and both gentlemen were extremely apologetic. I was able to store items in the safe. It is a bit small for storing an average-size laptop, however. I had two breakfast meals and one late night dinner via room service. Each time the meals were delivered within the time promised (20 minutes, 35 minutes and 40 minutes were times given, but two meals arrived in 20 minutes and one 35). The meals were all very good. I also used the express take out coffee and pastry place and found the food fresh and convenient there. As another author has mentioned, there are a lot of choices for food near the hotel. In-room dining is always expensive with the added fees that come with it, but there are times when the convenience is worth the cost. The in-room coffee maker would have allowed me to avoid the cost of the large pot of coffee I ordered with breakfast had I chosen to do that, but I agree with the others who complained about the mini-bar. I appreciated the fact that the front desk notified me that the mini-bar was weight sensitive. Knowing that, I did not even open the door. Normally, I really enjoy having the bar and often do purchase items. Having had a weight sensitive fridge charge me for items I did not use which resulted in my having to argue with the front desk at another property--I avoided the bar. I think Hyatt would be better served replacing the mini-bars than dealing with the ill will of so many. There are likely others like me who would welcome the bar and use it if they were not concerned about touching something and causing unwanted charges to be added to their bill. And speaking of charges....I was charged a fee of $5 plus for receiving a fax at the hotel. It was listed as \"Business Services\". i was told it was there upon check-in and that I should go four flights down to pick it up. Before I got around to doing that it was slipped under my door so I don't know if the charge was for delivery or for receiving the fax, but I did not attempt to argue over it upon check-out. I have stayed at other urban hotels where I have not been charged for receiving faxes or packages and where free internet has been available. At the Hyatt, one can purchase a Business Plan, but the plan packages Internet service and a continental breakfast and newspaper as part of the plan. I did not purchase the plan but the newspaper arrived daily anyway and as far as I can tell I was not charged for it. I wish they would remove the breakfast from this plan. Actually, what i wish is that they would provide free wi-fi. I find myself frequenting coffee shops and other places that do provide this service and avoiding those who do not. It is increasingly difficult to find free internet connectivity at large hotels and is becoming much more easy to find it at budget properties. I woud rather buy my morning newspaper (as I do at budget hotels) and have free wi-fi. Perhaps we can all collectively say this loudly and eventually be heard. I was at the hotel for four nights and there were at least two different large convention groups at the hotel during my stay. The hotel is large, but that fact did not interfere with my having a very pleasant stay at the hotel. The fact that this hotel is a convention destination really did not impact me at all. The employees were all friendly and I found the location to be excellent. I have traveled to Chicago many times in the past both for work and pleasure. I often stay at the Marriott on Michigan and it has long been my favorite property in Chicago. This visit to the Hyatt is making me re-think that, though. The view from my room was just so wonderful--the Navy Pier lights and fireworks at night--the river and lake blues and greens of the day--that view really made this room stand out. There was a robe in the room, typical Hyatt amenities--Portico soaps, etc. I guess my only complaints would be the lack of drawer space and plumbing noise. There were a lot of hangers in the closet and there was a shallow and a deep drawer in the closet, as well as the one by the bed--but, I could have used another drawer. I was traveling lightly, but I still would have liked one more drawer. Also the toilet flushed nosily and whenever the person in the room above flushed the toilet or used the shower the noise could he heard in my room. I heard noise in the hallway several times. If you can get a reservation at the North Pond, a restaurant located in Lincoln Park, I highly recommend that while you are in Chicago. Lots of wonderful places to eat, but North Pond is among the best.", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois City, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable!\u201d", "Author": "muttluvr", "ReviewID": "UR10037127", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency and enjoyed myself very much.

And if your destination is too far to walk, there exists a multitude of options nearby, including cabs, buses, and, for the thrifty (i.e. me), the \"El\" train can be boarded mere blocks away. (Tip: Not only is the El the cheapest option, it is also the easiest and most convenient if your destination is near one of the many available lines). The hotel rooms were very clean and tidy, the beds were fabulous, the TV pretty good, and the view magnificent. The front desk accomodated a couple of our \"special requests\" pertaining to check-in and check-out with no complaint whatsoever. BAD: Prior reviews made note that the hotel is not terribly suited to children. That advice is correct. This is not to say that children would be unwelcome, but the hotel seemed geared toward business travelers, conventioneers, younger childless couples, and people seeking entertainment (I concede those four categories may be redundant). The gargantuan street level lobby, which melds into the second level mezzanine, is a constant hub of noisy activity, not a place to relax or unwind. While I like activity and liveliness in a hotel, I found the lobby area to be obnoxious and off-putting. It is not a \"warm\" setting by any means, being moslty painted white beams, glass, and an odd array of decorations. One of life's pleasures is to sit, perhaps with a cup of coffee or a drink, in a comfortable hotel lobby and watch people come and go. Unfortunately, the Hyatt Regency's lobby discourages such lingering. That may be fine for some, but not for me. Also a quibble: the bathroom is insufficiently lit. Please add an overhead light. UGLY: When one stays at a hotel, particularly for vacation travel, one does not want to have to worry about getting charged, especially at exhorbitant prices, for, well, everything. For a hotel at this level, I would expect an \"included\" breakfast, if only Continental. Not so here. In fact the breakfast offered is very expensive. (Tip: Step outside and head a couple of blocks west, just across Michigan Ave, to the Corner Bakery restaurant - very nice breakfasts, great value, nice setting - especially the outdoor tables). I also chafe at being warned by the front desk of the \"weight sensitive\" mini-bar refrigerator in the room, in which one would find oneself sorely penalized for using it to cool your own water bottle (or to keep a baby's bottle cold). Apparently some Big Brother mechanism would recognize this transgression and bill you for it. Good grief. And why can't we make local calls for free? Give me a break. Finally, I refuse to pay $3 for a bottle of water in the hotel lobby. Do you really need the money that bad?

Food-wise I was not disappointed. First, the hotel. Located in downtown Chicago, the Hyatt is a pretty good hotel. I had a problem with my check-in, as my room with a queen bed had been sold and only double beds were available. I 'complained' to one of the front desk managers and was able to accomodate my original reservation. This was a pretty big deal to me, because we had travelled with friends also staying at the hotel. Not only was Keith able to accomodate us, but was able to put us up very near our friends. Thanks for that! The room was clean, spacious and had a fantastic view of the street below, the canal, and Lake Michigan. Service was definitely above-average. The food was nothing spectacular however. We had cocktails on several occasions, and I am still reeling at the prices! I have travelled extensively, and these are by far the most expensive cocktails I've consumed! $15 for Crown Royal or Ketel One. Not including gratuity. The breakfast at Bistro 151 was good not great. $22 bucks for a decent buffet breakfast, but you can order ala carte from a breakfast menu as well. Nice presentation, as my wife ordered from the menu. Room service was prompt and professional. Again pretty expensive. Danish, coffee, and OJ for 2 ran about $45 bucks. The concierge station was very helpful and was a source of some great local information. Be prepared for large functions, however. This is a hotel that hosts some pretty extravagant and large weddings/meetings. There were numerous events gong on while we were there. Still, it is what it is and I kind of knew what we were getting into when we made the reservation. Be prepared to leave the area after dark if you want to do anything. Downtown becomes a ghost town after 7 o'clock or so. It was difficult to find any locals in the area, much less local restaurants/bars. However, Chicago is one of the great food towns of the world, so try to take advantage. Frontera Grill, Rick Bayless's seminal dining establishment, was as good as I've heard; Pizzeria Uno, a Chicago mainstay, was incredible... The Chicago Dog I had at Wrigley Field was amazing!

Eat there or get it to go and grab a spot to sit on the river....beautiful! On Saturday nights in the summer they there is a river cruise ($20 per adult, kids were less) where you get a tour AND a prime spot on the Lake to view fireworks. We did not do this (because I only found out about it on Sunday), but I think it would have been great! We DID use the water taxi, which goes to Navy Pier and then connects to a water taxi to the Aquarium. The adults and the kids enjoyed the water taxi. $20 for 2 kids, 2 adults from the Hyatt, stop at Navy Pier, then to the Aquarium.

They of course return any amount not used by you. This policy encourages you to use bar and food services more than you might normally consider doing. The breakfast prices are above what is reasonable for what is offered, but service is excellent. One aside: If you wish to go to their main bar at night get there early because it draws a large crowd every night.

(Room 1255). Overall: I would return if I got my same room. Even though I received a conference rate of $180 per night, there are additional charges for a refrigerator and internet that can raise the cost of your stay. Work-out facility was free. The Location is awesome with all the touristy things and cheap food/personal supplies close by. Check-in: Very impersonal. There are kiosks so you don't have to speak to anyone. I checked in at the assistant manager's desk. She didn't smile much and had this stressed business look on her face. When you get your room card, there is no opportunity for change as the hotel was booked. I called the day before and reviewed my request with them..quiet sleeping place. The person could not guarantee anything but just acknowledged my request were noted. I was in the Hotel Towers (Not the West Tower where the convention center is below). The 6 elevators were fast, only waited slightly longer than normal, once during the time people are checking out about 10AM. Room: Spacious, king size bed (comfortable, able to sleep well), Desk, Flat Screen TV (Movies $13+), Leather chair and two sitting chairs. Air conditioner, worked fine, sounded like a small fan that just became white noise when I slept. It didn't make loud noises when it came on or shut off. (newer). Bathroom, spacious with passive vent (quiet), toiletries by Portico (soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion), shower cap. Noise: Yes, the walls are thin. The first night, heard children giggling but they quieted down by 10PM. I only heard people didn't hear bathroom noises. I could even hear the howl of the elevator go up on down. By 11PM to 6AM, all was quiet and I slept well. I have stayed in condos, just north of the Hyatt and I always heard sirens all night long. I think where the Hyatt is located there are not lots of people typically crossing in front of the Hyatt like the shopping district where there are people and cars everywhere. East Wacker is also a strange street which is raised above the other streets which makes going there difficult in a car. Internet is not free ~$13 per day. Refrigerator under TV (quiet) but it was filled with Hotel Snacks. A sign covered the door warning you if you stored any of your personal items, there will be a onetime $25 charge. If you would like your personal refrigerator for that fee, the hotel will bring one to your room. If you want to save money, I would bring a soft-sided cooler and fill it with ice. If you want your sheets cleaned you have to call to alert them to change them rather than leaving a card on the bed. Workout Facility: ~8 Treadmills, Elipticals, ~6 machines, free wts (lowest 8lbs, they need smaller wts for junior lifters). Does the job while traveling. Lobby: Calm during the day, noisy at night from the Bar. They allow smoking, so it spoils the lobby when just one person is smoking. There is a snack bar with espresso (automated machines with Starbucks Coffee, $2 for a banana). I would go through the tunnels (in the same shopping area of Houlahans), there is a deli with fresh fruit by the pound and cheaper food by far. (Cosi, McDonalds, Potbelly Sandwiches, Mexican, Japanese, Fresh Choice). If you're on a budget, go explore and don't just accept the hotel snack bar. Stenson's: Nice jazz singer, ate a Rib-eye (fair), but the sea bass was excellent. Parking: Outrageous! >$40 for over-night, day ~$16? reasonable to allow people to attend conventions at the Hotel. Convention Center: The conference rooms are freezing you will need a sweater even if it is hot outside. There is a FedEx Kinkos in the Houlahan shopping area if you need copies. There is a business center. Location of Hotel: After I walked the city for the week, I have found this to be the best location. 20 minutes south (Millennium Park), 40 min (Shed Aquarium, Planetarium), 40 min southwest (Union Train Station), 2 blocks (Boat Tour, Corner Bakery), 15 min Northwest-Michigan St Shopping. 20 Northeast (Navy Pier). Overall, I felt safe around the hotel and walking on Upper Wacker. My husband I drop off a rental on Lake St, southeast of the Hyatt and walked back at 12:30 AM. Lake ST was a little dark but once on Wacker we were fine. (runs along the river). Other restaurants: Houlahans for breakfast buffet $10 without the beverage (eggs, sausage, biscuits, hash, omelets, fruit etc). Italian Village: (50 min wait, they seem to let those who had tickets to plays/shows in faster) make a reservation. Food was amazing (veal with polenta and seafood ravioli). Deal: If you are an educator bring your ID. I work for the state preschool system and I got into the museums for free. (Shed/Planetarium). Others provide a significant discount. The walking times are based on temperatures of 85 degrees. When it got to 95 plus humidity, I barely could walk 3 blocks without jumping into a hotel to cool down to continue my trek. Bring a water bottle. Side note: People in Chicago smoke without concern. In Seattle, smoking is not allowed in public places and 25 ft from an entrance. So at restaurants with outdoor eating you might have someone smoking next to you which spoils the event. Just be prepared. The Free Trolley service runs along side the Hyatt. You might have to transfer to different lines to get to the museum area but it may help the weary traveler. There bellpersons are awesome as they are always trying to get you a cab. Shuttle from Airport: Continental Shuttle runs every half hour to Midway and O'Hare. For O'Hare, try to get on a shuttle 1/2 earlier than you would. There are always tons of people waiting for O'Hare.", "Date": "August 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gaithersburg, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for downtown Chicago.\u201d", "Author": "JoeKH", "ReviewID": "UR8363575", "Content": "The Hyatt Regency is a very large property located on the Chicago River just south of the shopping district and close to Navy Pier and the Museum District - obviously a great central location.

The instruction on the controls read to the effect \"this heating sytem is silent & works on a radiant system, you will not hear a fan\". Whoever wrote that was stone deaf. As soon as it was switched on the roar was like being in an aircraft. It would have been impossible to sleep with it on and apart from anything else it didn't work. Any schoolboy knows that hot air rises, so why would you put the heating system at ceiling level. No wonder it took 6 hours to go up a degree. The maintenance man sent to look at it agreed the whole system was a disaster. The touch sensitive mini-bar is technology a step too far & to charge $25 for a room fridge when you are paying $300-400 per night is outrageous.

Our view was great, looking out from the front of the building onto the Chicago skyline. Nights were beautiful. The location is great. I did find it off-putting to be greated at the front desk with a stern warning about the minibar. I was told it was motion sensitive and that I would be charged a $25 fine for putting my refreshments in there. I never go near minibars myself - way too pricey. The thought of setting off an alarm kept me well away. Staff routinely knocked on our door every day to inspect the minibar. Do these things make that much money that there needs to be this much fuss over them??? It just wasn't a warm and friendly welcome that one expects to get. It seems it's all about money, not about customer service. We asked for a non-smoking room, but there were aromatic signs that prior guests had definately been smoking. There's a $250 fine for that. The guests on one side of us started loud conversation at 4 am, in tones one might hear at a ballpark. Their son had an incredibly penetrating voice. The metal door connecting our two rooms was a great conductor of noise. I endured this, thinking they had to get up early to catch a plane, but after two hours, I figured they weren't going any where, not even to bed. I got up, stuck my head out to check the room number and called the Front Desk. About 25 minutes later Security knocked on their door. The noise was so loud, they couldn't even hear the man knocking. But we finally got that matter resolved. Lastly the hotel offers wireless Internet in the rooms for only $13.63 /day. (ouch) There is a tasteful embossed ivory card that says to look in the In-Room Directory for information about connecting. The In-Room Directory says instructions are on the desk. Ok, so after this verbal volleyball that goes nowhere, I just dove in, not knowing what the network was. My computer displayed about 5 wireless networks, and I quickly assumed GuestTek was what I needed. Unfortunately, I could not keep a connection. Despite the fact that there was no information on the little card or in the In-Room Directory, I had noted a phone number in the Terms of Agreement which I'm sure no one reads. I called the number and found it was no longer in use, but I was given the new number. Now how hard is it for GuestTek to change that number??? I finally did get through to a patient technician who decided he needed to reboot on his end. But the connection was problematic for two days. I had to drag my laptop down to the lobby to get my work done. And for this I'm paying $13.63/day!!!

There was no fan in the bath, and although it was possible to regulate our heat, the fan in the room was insufficient to ever clear out the humidity from showers so the room constantly felt damp. Our view was fine, but it was obscured by condensation on the inside of the window because of the humidity.

The weekend we went, every negative review on Tripadvisor turned out to be perfectly accurate. As other reviewers had experienced, I too was informed that no rooms were available when I checked in upon arrival. This was despite the fact that I had called earlier to confirm my reservation. Because no rooms were available, I was offered a \"parlor room,\" which was described as a \"standard room with no bed.\" Because the parlor room had no bed, a rollaway bed would be provided instead. Furthermore, because this parlor room option was being offered, Hyatt claimed not to be obligated to offer alternate accomodations at a different hotel. I am fairly certain this is a scam Hyatt has planned in advance. Hyatt very likely overbooks their hotel whenever possible while keeping one or two of these parlor rooms on hand. When customers arrive and no rooms are available, they offer a parlor room. Predictably, very few customers are willing to accept this arrangement. Thus, the parlor rooms remain available for any customers that arrive even later, and Hyatt is never obligated to offer alternate accomodations. On top of this, the hotel was ridiculously loud and crowded. The ground floor of the hotel is essentially a nightclub, complete with the thundering bass and shady clientele.

I was able to call and check in over the phone at 11:30 the day of arrival. I was specifically looking for a room with a view of the Magnificent mile fireworks on Saturday night. The woman I talked to knew excatly which rooms would be great for that, but none were available yet. She took my cell phone number and called me back about a half hour later when one of those rooms became available. Talk about excellent service! Additionally, when I called, I asked if breakfast was included. The woman told me that it normally is not, but that she would include vouchers for 2 at the breakfast buffet for each morning. That was a $22/person value! The buffet was excellent. There was cereal, dried and fresh fruit, muffins, pastries, hash, sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes, and made to order omelots. We arrived about 8:40 at night and check in went smoothly. Our room was on the 20th floor of the East Tower. We had a King room with a great view of the river and the Wrigley building. It was clean and average in size. The floor to ceiling windows were great for watching the fireworks. Toiletries were nice and replenished/replaced every day. Cleaning was also thorough. My girlfriend forgot her toothbrush, and the front desk was happy to provide one for her. There was a digital thermostat on the wall which was fairly quick to react to changes. The location was excellent. 3 blocks to the El, walking distance to museums, Navy Pier and the Magnificent mile. Millenium park is a 2 block walk as well. There is a small grocery store on Stetson St. less than a block away which sells wine, and other necessary items. THE CONS: Parking is expensive at $41/day, so we parked in the millenium park garage for $18/day, which is only 2 blocks away. There is little to no drawer space for clothing if you are the type to transfer your clothes from your suitcase to the dresser. There is no fan in the bathroom, so it fogs up easily. The lighting in the bathroom is also kind of dim. The doors are thin and hallway noise was easily heard. I do not know if the walls were equally thin, because we did not hear anyone through them. Sunday morning the hotel was very busy (as is expected), so elevators took quite a while and were sometimes full when they arrived.

The staff and managers were pleasant when we voiced our issues, but we will never stay here again. We travel to Chicago at least 8+ times/year for pleasure, so we've stayed almost everywhere downtown. If you are traveling to Chicago it is a known fact you will pay A LOT to park your car (owned or rented). The valet parking at the Hyatt was an absolute NIGHTMARE when we checked out after a three day stay. We called down for our car and was told we had to go to the garage to pick up our car. When I went into the garage there must have been 200+ people either in line, or sitting on the floor of the reception area wondering if or when they would ever see their vehicle. Some people told me they'd been there an hour waiting for their car. Picture an airport that has canceled all of their flights, and that is what this lobby looked like. The hotel told us that they were just busy and everyone was checking out at once. I was also told this is a regular situation. My advice to the hotel is that you need MORE STAFF if you are making people wait an hour to get their car. If you know Sundays are your busiest day, HIRE MORE PEOPLE! There were other issues with our room, but I would end up writing a small essay listing those things. On a positive note the hotel is in a great location, but there are other hotels we've stayed at in Chicago for the same price and offering a much better experience.

The Lakeshore Athletic Club next door is one of the nicest and largest workout facilities I've been to. The hotel itselt is a large convention hotel and lobby is busy and buzzing with lots of people and activity. Both towers are shaped like the letter H, and the hallways are well light. Late at night, there security was checking for keys before entering the elevator banks and a key was needed to call elevator. There is a medium sized workout room with a large variety of weights and machines, but no locker facilities, showers, or pool.

The phone number is on their website. When we called, we requested a queen or king size bed and a room with a view, and they delivered. We had a beautiful view of the river and Navy Pier (and Lake Michigan of course). The parking was $41/ 24 hours, but we were only charged $41 total for some reason (and we were there from Friday-Sunday). That was a definite plus. Internet was $13.63/24 hours which we felt was somewhat reasonable. The hotel room was very nice and very clean. There was a large work desk and an additional table with four chairs, as well as a sofa bed, an alarm clock which also serves as an iPod dock and an Oreck XL air purifier. There were extra towels, toilet paper, a blanket, and pillows in our closet. We were very impressed with the hotel for what we paid. There were only a few very minor things that bothered us, but they were resolved quickly. On our second night, our \"neighbors\" had very loud music and we could hear them talking (still) at about midnight. We called the front desk and were then transferred to security. About ten minutes later, I heard a knock on their door and the music was turned down. The walls seemed to be paper thin, but it was ok since we ultimately slept very well in the comfortable bed. Also, because we didn't have our room number when we first arrived to check in, the valet just took our name and said they would bill the parking to our room. This was fine untiil we went to retrieve our car the next day and we were told we had to come pay for parking in the parking garage. Instead, we just went to the front desk and asked that they charge the parking to our room. It was taken care of, and we called the valet and our car arrived shortly thereafter. Overall I think the hotel was GREAT and very accommodating. I wish I would have known a little more about the location before I booked it (it's South of the river), since there are not a lot of restaurants within walking distance, but we would stay there again if we got the same great rate.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, WI", "Title": "\u201cA great experience\u201d", "Author": "Zgibson", "ReviewID": "UR6803491", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt Regency during the week, Tuesday - Friday, after getting the room for $69/night on Hotwire.

We'd called ahead and requested a room with a king size bed and that's what we got. It was clean, modern, and spacious; the bed and pillows were heavenly; and the bathroom was very nice and roomy. My only wish was for more drawer space for our clothing and more hangers in the closet. The mini-bar is weight sensitive, if you remove anything the scale senses it and the item is charged to your room, so we never touched the bar. There is a grocery store literally a minute walk away, so we got snacks and such there. The room was right off of the elevators, and we were not disturbed by noise. Likewise, we never encountered a problem with bar or band noise or crowds as we came and left the hotel. When we checked out, we called ahead for valet to bring the car. They said it'd be a 15-20 minute wait but the car was there in 10 minutes. I'll admit that parking is pricey at $41 a night, and there are several ramps nearby that are much cheaper, but we chose to splurge on the valet parking.

Pass arrived within a few days of purchase and makes using the subways and buses easy. Front desk staff was quick to check us in and gave us exactly the room that we requested. We were able to check in very early and were treated very professionally by Megan at the desk. Room was on a higher floor corner facing the Chicago Tribune. Room was extremely clean and I didn't see any food trays etc. as noted on other reviews. Room appeared updated with an extremely clean bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows and extra towels and blanket in closet. Not a great deal of drawer space. Didn't wait more than a few minutes for the concierge which were extremely helpful. The location is okay, steps from Michigan Avenue right near transportation. We walked the 10-15 minute walk to the Chicago Art Museum which is free until Feb. 21. The hotel is huge with two towers and holds more than 1800 rooms. It has a convention type setting but we knew this and for what we paid were extremely happy. We took the Gray Line tour which picked us up on time right in front of the hotel. Didn't eat the food but lines in the morning appeared long. There is a Houlihans right next door. Had drinks at the Martini bar and loved the setting. If I was planning a family trip with kids in tow I might look for another hotel considering that there is no pool. Dined at Maggiano's for great Italian family style food with huge portions at inexpensive prices, had a huge portion of meatballs and rigatoni for 11.95. Went to the Chicago Chop House and had a great steak for a fair price. Both places need a reservation and I would make them online on their websites.

While this frustrated me, it probably wouldn't have been as bad if the valet service wasn't as poorly run as it is. There is a bottle neck of cars in front of the hotel, unorganized and rude valet staff and a considerable amount of wait time for the car retrieval (my wait time ranged from 15-30 mins each time easily). It was faster and easier to call for my car to be brought up front, but I was not informed of this service until the final time I retrieved my car. Sigh.

When I initially entered my room, I was impressed by the design and concept. It had an Oriental feel to it and reminded me of some of the boutique type hotels I have stayed in the past. I noticed on the surface that the room was rather dirty. When I sat down at the desk, the leather placemat was very sticky. On the bathroom vanity, there were numerous soap type stains. I was able to easy rub them off with a damp washcloth. The walls were dirty, both in the bathroom and bedroom. Both the carpet and the bedspread on my bed had cigarette burns on them. This was rather surprising since I was in a non-smoking room. The carpet was more understandable, but I was surprised that a bedspread with two burns on it would be used. I also noticed that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plush bathrobes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd promised by the check-in staff was not in the room. I called to have a robe delivered and when I put it on the next morning, it had a big rip in the front of it. I had dinner out, came back to the room and put on my pajamas. I was a bit disappointed that we did not get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn down service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we were promised. It something I enjoy while traveling and makes me feel a bit pampered. I pulled back the bedspread and noticed much debris on the sheet. Initially, I tried to brush the sheet off, but on further inspection, I noticed there were at least five hairs on the sheets. It was really disgusting. I did contact housekeeping and the sheets were changed by a very nice woman named Sarah. She did have much difficulty finding sheets that were not torn. After 20 minutes, I told her I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if they were torn; I just wanted them to be clean. She did replace the burnt bedspread and apologized that it was used. I also did not receive the daily newspaper. I did call and re-request the turndown service the next night; I received it on night #2, but not #3. I suppose overall I was very disappointed by the room that I received. I did call to complain several times (robe, turn down service, dirty sheets) but no one seemed too concerned about me. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I should have pursued it more while I was there, I felt like I was being too picky, but when I got home, my husband thought the room sounded terrible.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat price for the location\u201d", "Author": "thirdromechild", "ReviewID": "UR6085947", "Content": "Great location, great price (got it off hotwire for 90 bucks a night).

The second story of the all glass atrium is where the front desk and the Big Bar are located. Im not sure how to describe the lobby---other than I would've exepcted a nicer lobby for a hyatt hotel.

We got our room at three and were not all that impressed with it. The view was wonderful. We had a clear view of the river, marina and lake from the 31st floor of the east tower. The room itself left A LOT lot to be desired. The carpet was stained and the furniture seemed out of place and uncomfortable. The bed was rock hard and the bathroom was old and begging to be remodeled. The staff were friendly for the most part, however we didnt really feel the love when we went to seek out the concierge for assistance. The other thing I should mention is that the hotel, in my opinion, isnt really a great place for families. In the west tower there is a nightclub called Hard Drive in the middle of the lobby on friday and saturday nights. It is smack dab in the middle of the lobby and blasts throbbing music with flashing strobe lights. I dont mind nightclubs, but I didnt really appreciate watching drunk people bumping and grinding on each other when I was trying to quietly unwind with a drink after a long day. I guess I perfer my hotel to be a bit more mello and classy. We ordered room service in the morning, but theres no where to really eat in the room aside from the bed or desk. I tried to get a coffee from the coffee shop in the west tower, but the line was literally out the door. All in all I wasnt that impressed.

I checked the reviews quickly on TA and thought for the amount of time we were planning to be in the room, it was worth the 60USD a night. Location seemed ok. When we arrived we had no trouble with the type of room requested and had checked in earlier on their 1-800 #. Got a king room, no smoking, on 20th floor. Yes, we looked into an office building(west tower) but it was the weekend, so no worries of peeping Toms. We could see Soldier Field from our room which my husband liked. The room was exactly like the pics on the Hyatt website. As described by other travellers, the lighting was not great, and the room was worn, but in good shape. Everything was clean, but could use some sprucing up. Bed was no problem. DONT use the room fridge to store YOUR drinks, as the hotel will charge you by weight (what is up with that?) and if you even take a drink or item from the fridge to look at consider it sold as again, it will recognize the diff weight. This sounded crazy to me but then again, I wasn;t going to pay 8usd for a bottle of water. This could be a problem with young kids who like to look in the fridge or if you would like to keep stuff in your room. Location was great, 2 min walk to MM, 10-15 walk or quick free shuttle to Navy Pier. 1 min walk to Millenium Park etc. The lobby bar (Hardrive) can get pretty loud at night, but the BIG lounge is a good place to stop at the end of a busy day. Overall, no complaints, just suggestions. Don't assume that the fancy name Hyatt Regency means it will be top notch. If I had my children with me, I probably would not have stayed here. If you are looking for a good hotel to stop by and shower, sleep etc. this hotel will be fine. If we were going to be in our room a little more I probably would have stuck with the other hotel.

We were booked on the 34th floor - Suites. If our suite was as small and boring as it was, what must a regular room be like?!! The layout was \"different\" with the bed facing the entrance not the window. There was little room to put a suitcase for unpacking that you were constantly walking into. The bathroom had very little counter space and didn't appear to be cleaned very well each day. Water spots remained on the floor from day to day. The shower was okay with the extended shower curtain I had read about in a review. Only redeeming thing about the bathroom with the \"industrial\" toilet. Our view was of an appartment building and the street below. Nothing special - like I said - not my idea of a suite. The colors in the room were not my favorite either.

This hotel is always full and enormously profitable consequently the management is, at best, indifferent to complaints. Where does one begin? To start with the individuals behind the front desk are always new and inexperienced. It takes them an inordinately long time to check you in, and it will take at least 30 min for your luggage to be delivered to your room from their luggage staging area. I knew their attitude to guest services (and guests in general) was a problem when I first called about our luggage (after waiting 30 min and when reached a live body ---- which took considerable effort and another 5 min) instead of apologizing the individual rudely indicated \u00e2\u20ac\u201cprior to hanging up -- that it had only been 20 min since the luggage reached the staging area from the front desk. Since we were staying for a convention and needed a hospitality suite we had a bedroom with an adjacent suite living room \u00e2\u20ac\u201cmeeting room. This was the shabbiest suite I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve even had the misfortune of having to use. The couch was missing two back pillows. It lacked an adequate sink and fortunately I rented a SUV because I had to go to Costco and buy a small standard bar refrigerator ($150.00) for the only fridge is the hospitality suite was a most inadequate mini-bar model. When I inquired of management they offered to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a charge of $30.00 a day additional min-bar units. The A/C is fundamentally defective in design. In our bedroom there is no circulating air. The a/c is provided (I use that word most liberally since there is none) via chilled water circulating through a pipe located close to the ceiling behind the cove lightning and near the window. After numerous complaints when the head engineer and her assistant visited they advised me to buy fans and strategically place them so that they force air across the pipe. UNBELEIVABLE! Relative to hot water for showers (and all other guest services) this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motto seems to be spare no effort to lower our operating cost and increase profits: comfort of guests be dammed! No matter when you want a shower you will have to wait for hot water. They have evidentially calculated the projected demand at all hours and make sure to never produce any more than the minimum they can get away with. During our stay I showered at 5:00AM, 6:00AM, 7:15AM, 8:00AM and 9:00AM as well as evenings before bed. ON ALL OCCASIONS I HAD TO WAIT FOR HOT WATER OR \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ENJOY\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A LUKE WARM OR COOLER SHOWER! Needless to say room service was always a 40 min or longer wait. But then again the eggs were not edible so why bother. If you want clean linen you need to actually call housekeeping and demand it. Finally you can forget about complaining to a live body the phone system seems to connect only with individuals \u00e2\u20ac\u0153voice mail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

They offer \"deluxe\" rooms for an extra $15 per night, and those have things that a Hyatt hotel should have as part of every room. As for my room, the fridge threatens me with a $25 fine if I put something in it. Nice. Paying $10 per night for internet seems absurd at this price point as well. At least with the Westin if you belong to their frequent traveller program it is free... but not here. I went to the \"Big Bar\" something they are very proud of. The service was glacially slow. I asked about premium liqours and the waitress said they had everything. I named a few bourbons that I would like, and they didn't have them. So I settled for a glass of Maker's Mark and some wings. When my bill finally came I paid over $30 for a single glass of bourbon and some chicken wings! Needless to say I was not even remotely impressed.

Maybe the other rooms were nice, but I never saw them so I can not comment on them. At check out they have electronic machines (think the self check in at the airport). Because we had the room service voucher we needed to check out with a human. This was handled smoothly and well taken care of. The room service was fabulous!!!!

The bell guy never said thank you for the 6 dollar tip, which made me mad. Also, if you're driving, get directions right to the parking garage because you'll be stuck in a cluster at the other tower with taxis. Pull right into the garage, which is in the West Tower, and they will call you a bellman from there, if you need one.

The room was adequate. The bathroom was old fashioned and the tub drained slowly. The temperature in the room was uncomfortable as it was sooo moist in there, like, old heating and air conditioning system. I hand washed a pair of undies and they stayed wet for two entire days. I also thought the location was just okay. If we ever go back, we will use our military rate of 149 given at numerous hotels and pay the extra and stay where we want next time. I would not stay at the Hyatt again. I wanted to use the Internet and it was 7 bucks for 15 minutes. We actually like Marriott courtyards and Hilton Garden Inns better. Who cares if a hotel has a bar and a full service restaurant -- we don't! Go eat pizza at Giordanos closeby. It was really good. City is great and I would go visit the city again. Great military discounts everywhere, just ask. We got in the Sears Tower for free and an architectural tour for free on Shoreline. I didn't, but my hubby did, active duty. Big savings for two things!

First things first - our room (booked on Hotwire for $85/night) was clean, roomy, comfortable and nicely decorated. I loved how the Hyatt manages to make a normal-sized shower seem so much larger by just having an arched shower curtain rod. The effect (my arms NOT brushing against a shower curtain while washing) was definitely appreciated. The location, as others have mentioned, is great - right off Wacker and near Michigan. It's a central location...close to Loop area attractions as well as shopping on Magnificent Mile. I have to say this, though. This hotel is HUGE. If you don't like riding in a packed elevator or feeling like you're staying in a city within a city, this place is not for you. Tons of people everywhere. Lots of groups - we were unlucky enough to stay in the room next to a large group of young men who were very, very loud. And I'm in my 20s; not a finicky old woman. We had a hard time sleeping our first night because of all the commotion these guys caused - at 3:30 am, nonetheless. Someone else on our floor must've called security, because a hotel employee thankfully paid a visit to our obnoxious neighbors. The following night, they were quiet and we were able to sleep peacefully. Luckily, we didn't spend any time in any of the hotel's common areas or restaurants, as Chicago itself offers so many better options. Keep in mind that this is one of the biggest hotels in the city - it is NOT a boutique hotel with extremely personal service. We waited about 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car around - but then again, it was Mother's Day and the hotel was packed with brunch attendees. The valet mentioned that the hotel had 3,000 cars they were trying to manage, so that might give you an idea of the scale of this place. The hotel staff were very pleasant and efficient, which was also nice. The valets were also energetic and full of smiles. So I would recommend this hotel if you can get a room on the cheap, meaning less than $90/night for a weekend night in the city. I would've felt a little cheated if I had paid more than $90/night, honestly, and I've traveled around the world (staying at some very nice and not-so-nice hotels). I prefer smaller hotels, personally, but the price was right. If you end up staying here...make sure to ask for a room away from the elevator bank - you can hear a LOT of noise in these rooms. Every time a toilet flushed upstairs, we heard it, so I imagine you'd definitely hear those six (or eight - I can't remember) elevators shuttling about all night. All in all, not the best place I've stayed in Chicago, but it was a good deal for the price. Again, the room was very nice and comfortable - I had no problem with the room itself, just the amount of noise we heard at night.

Maybe smokers, former smokers, and people who live or work with smokers won't smell it, but it was very noticeable. It definitely smelled like a place that recently disallowed smoking. For my nose, the air purification unit wasn't working hard enough. Otherwise, the room was about average for a Hyatt. There were not enough drawers in my room to put my clothes away. The television unit that usually doubles as one only had about 3 drawers -- big enough for a yellow pages book. Bathroom was clean.

Our room was nice and we were happy with it until cigarette smoke started rolling in through our vents. Since we were on a non-smoking floor, it was pretty irritating. When we called to inquire about where the smoke could be coming from, the woman suggested that it was coming from outside and offered to \"spray\" our room. We were 14 floors up and it was obvious that it was coming from one of the other rooms on our floor. But that wasn't the worst of the smells.

The female receptionist was pleasant and most informative as to what the hotel had to offer, and gave me a warm welcome. The room was clean and nicely appointed. The only part of the room that seemed a bit cheap was the lounge chair, it looked like it had been purchased at a flea market or a second hand store.I am sure the Hyatt could do better. The bed was fanctastic. The bath room was immaculant and had all the amenities that one would need. I did not eat at the Hyatt, as I found the prices too high for my budget. I had asked for a late check-out, they were accomodating for an extra hour at no charge but then the price jumped, too expensive for a few extra hours. The hotel is excellently maintained.

For example, I asked about the fireworks on Saturday night and requested a room with a view of the show. I paid extra for a room with a city view and the room did have a great view. The first person I spoke with did not guarantee that I would be able to see the show. The second person I spoke with assured me that I would not be able to see the show. At 6:30 pm, I heard the fireworks and decided to look out the window on the off-chance that I would be able to see something. It turned out that the fireworks were directly below my window. I had a terrific view. However, the staff had no idea. More importantly, the guests across the hall spent most of the night yelling and swearing and being generally obnoxious. I called the concierge at 1:00 am to report the noise and I was assured that someone would come up to deal with the problem. I watched to see if anyone came for half an hour (the noise continued), but no one showed up. The noise continued through the night.

We got a great deal on Hotwire. I was alittle wary on the reviews I had read, but didn't want to pass on the price. Here are my specifics: Location: Downtown on the Chicago River, one block from Michigan Ave. We walked to all our sights and shopping. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Great views from the upper floors. Hotel: The hotel is very spread out, there are two towers. Very busy with conventions and lots of visitors. The atrium was loud but very nice. There were lots of things to do in the hotel, many top-rated restaurants, and you must go to the BIG bar. The drinks are pricey but you'll see why they call it the BIG bar. We had one margarita, expect to pay $20 for house and even more for top-shelf. It was fun though and we got to watch the playoffs on their big screen. Rooms: I was very disappointed in this category. The room itself was very nicely appointed, but one of the smallest rooms I've every stayed in. We had a queen room on the 14th floor. Nice view, but cramped. Luckily we didn't stay much in the room. When you can see the bed from the bathroom, that's small. There was also no hot water pressure and water seemed to be brown. But after I ran it awhile it cleared up. Other: We didn't eat at the hotel, but there were many restarants to choose from. I would recommend Houlihan's down the street for breakfast, $9.99 buffet. We also ate at Pizzerio Uno on Wabash, arrive early or call ahead, the wait on the weekends can be long. Worth the wait though, the pizza was awesome. Checkout the Sears Tower Skydeck for a unforgettable view of Chicago skyline and nearby states. Again, can be a long wait on the weekends, we waited about an hour.

I was apprehensive about staying at this place after reading some of the reviews. Got a rate of $99 a night through Travelzoo. Paid $15 extra per night for a deluxe room. I was not exactly blown away, but I was not disappointed either. The Lobby: Turns into a very loud and busy nightclub at night. The bar one floor up was not much better. This was really not a problem because we were up there for a girls weekend. The bar was way too crowded for my taste. We went to another club. If travelling with a family, or a couple wanting to get away, I would recommend staying in the West Tower. You can enter through the unimpressive lobby there and avoid the whole club scene. Another reviewer referred to the West Tower as shabby etc. The rooms are identical to the ones in the east tower. I think the West Tower is actually much quieter. The front desk workers were very professional and personnable. We arrived at 11 am and had no problem checking in. Our rooms were ready. The concierge was very helpful and gave some great tips. The front desk printed up our boarding passes the night before we departed. I found the staff to be far more helpful and friendly than I encountered at Le Meridian. Check out was done over the phone and I picked up my receipt via video machine in the lobby. Took less than one minute. The Room: Deluxe room had rather odd layout. Bed was smack in the middle of the room. Attached the the back of the headboard was the desk area. So when at your desk your back is toward the window and you look into the back of the headboard. Roomy desk area. The view was excellent. The reading lights were attached to both sides of the king bed. The look was meant to be sleek and modern, I found them to be a nuissance. I was always worring about smacking my head into them when sitting up. The room was decent sized. I think it would have appeared larger and more functional if it had a different layout. The bed was new and very comfortable. I like the idea of duvet covers. I did not hear any noise from neighboring rooms and street noise was minimal, but the noise from the hallway could be annoying. The doors are extremely thin and there were large gaps at the bottom and one of the sides. Rolling up towels and placing them at the bottom of the door helped buffer out some of the noise. The bathroom: Average. Not much counter space. Okay shower pressure. Never had a problem with getting hot water. The towels were paper thin and scratchy and the toilet paper was atrocious. Remember the TP when you were in elementary school? This was worse than those jagged little squares. Dermabrasion where and when I did not want it. Overall, this hotel was better than I expected. I found the staff to be very well trained and professional. They did not blink or roll their eyes at my requests i.e. non smoking, king bed, away from elevator and high up with a view.

I had some trouble initially connecting to the Internet, but finally got it to work after calling the help desk. There were also not enough hangers. Housekeeping was sometimes a little tardy; I had to call one day when they hadn't cleaned by 1 pm (not a major issue, except I had several coworkers joining me in the room for a client conference call and the room was still not tidied). Noise level was good; we could hear a few sounds, but it was generally quiet because we were the last room at the end of the hallway (although one of our empty neighbor rooms had an alarm set for 7:30 am that went off every morning). We called for laundry to pick up a bag of shirts to be cleaned and pressed and left everything in a bag by the door. A couple hours later, we received a voicemail that said they tried to pick up but the laundry wasn't ready. Finally we realized they had gone to the wrong room (they mentioned the room they checked had been cleaned, but ours wasn't). I found it ironic that they have eco-friendly notices, but the hot water problem (mentioned in other reviews) requires you to run the water for several minutes in both the shower and sink to get the right temp. Water pressure was poor. Service was generally good at the front desk, bell desk, restaurant staff, and doormen. One of the doormen arranged for a limo to drive us to evening destinations over several days. The concierge was fairly successful in getting us dinner reservations (we tried Keefers on their recommendation, but changed our minds on the second night's reservation at some French restaurant). We ate the first night at Stetsons, which was quite good but very expensive. Without alcohol, dinner for two came to $150 including tip. We also tried the breakfast at Networks in the main lobby area, which wasn't bad. Food served at the conference was standard hotel fare, nothing special. The hotel is very spread out. I'm glad we were staying in the East tower; the one time I ventured into the West tower, I got lost and was unimpressed with the shabbier decor and elevators.

Every 3 days is just laziness on the Hyatt's part. Every other day or every two is reasonable. If the hotel is indeed eco friendly, then why aren't there recyling bins in guest rooms or in other prominent areas.

We called the front desk after 5 minutes and they said to just continue to let it run and call back in a few minutes and if it still isn't working they will send someone up. It did eventually get hot, but it threw us off by 15 minutes. Big Bar in the hotel was a really fun place. You can't beat the view and the 48oz. martinis, margaritas, beers, and drinks are very fun. They are pretty reasonable at under 20 for all of the Big drinks. Most of the clientele looked like they were guests of the hotel stopping in to get a drink before dinner or clubs. It would be a great place to go for the start of bachelorette party or girls night out with the big fun drinks and Big appetizers. There were a lot of groups like that there. The location is fantastic, the valet is expensive but very courteous and quick with your car, and the 16.95 breakfast buffet was above average. The service in the hotel was good but not fantastic. All of the waiters, bellhops, and front desk people just were a little off in service. It seems as if the Hyatt is trying to improve this because with literally every time you interact with an employee you get handed a survey.

We showed up late on the evening of our stay due to our late flight in to O'Hare (thus the reason we confirmed). The first thing I encounter when walking into the hotel was some disco with music so loud I had to put my fingers in my ears. It looked like they were throwing some sort of dance party in open area lounge at the main entrance. When I got to the front desk, the woman's face turned white when I told her I was checking in. She took my license and went in the back room (to speak to a manager I presume). She returned 5 minutes later to tell me they GAVE OUR ROOM AWAY! She offered me a voucher for another hotel 5 miles away for that night and then told me we would have to come back the next day to the Hyatt to get a room! We chose that hotel because of its proximity to Grant Park, Navy Pier and all the other attractions in the area. Since we already paid (in full) through Expedia, she was binding me to stay in their hotel even though they did not hold a confirmed reservation. I explained (Yelling over the music) that I had 15 bags, a wife and two sleeping toddlers in the car (it was 11:45pm by then) and I was not about to tote them from hotel to hotel just to satisfy Hyatt. She offered no explanation, no alternatives and no apologies. As I was leaving, another couple that had just driven 17 hours tried to check in and were left roomless as well! We were left with no choice but to leave. We drove by their Voucher hotel - it was a zero-star roach motel unfit for anyone. Certainly not the 4-star hotel I already paid for. We were unable to find another room in Chicago and had to drive around for two more hours just to find a room. We finally found a room 45 miles away at 2:30am. Since we were so far away from Chicago, we missed all of our vacation plans and the vacation was ruined. After contacting Hyatt with this mess, they offered no remuneration and little in the way of an apology. I will NEVER stay in another Hyatt after this HUGE disappointment. Be Warned!

The walls weren't as paper-thin as other hotels I've been to, but in the mornings we couldn't tell if housekeeping was knocking on our door or on the doors of other rooms on the hall -- sound definitely travels well down the hallway. Our room was *dark*, too -- especially in the bathroom, which had only one dim light for the whole room. Speaking of the bathroom, the water pressure seemed low. Not low enough to complain about, but low enough for us to miss our showers at home... Other things to note -- as has been mentioned before, you can't store food in your fridge -- they'll nail you with a $25 charge if you try. You can request another food fridge if you're taking home leftovers from restaurants, but that will cost you $25. (Not sure if that is a flat fee or per night... we didn't bother trying.) Additionally, housekeeping came very early in the morning -- before 9AM every day we were there.

For anyone else reading this review you take the blue line to the Clark/Lake stop (about 40 minute ride fare is $1.75) and than a taxi to the hotel about another 5 minutes. Ok, so when we arrived at the hotel it was big as all the reviews said, but, we did not encounter any lines at the check in stand. The ladies that checked us in were very pleasant. After reading reviews on this site I requested a Delux room in the west tower. At first they said this is an additional $15 per night charge, but we asked if there was anything they could do to wave the fee the lady was more than accomadating. So, kudo's to them (I am sorry I cant remember her name). As many of the other reviews have said, the lobby can be a noisy place with the Big Bar and the dance floor (I think it is called Harddrive or something along those line) but, from our room on the 25th floor you would have never known those places existed. Our room was quite nice, this was also a consern of mine after reading some of the reviews. The room temperature was very comfortable, if for some reason we needed to change the temp there was a thermostat on the wall. The beds were great not your typical hard hotel bed, my friend even said she wasnt used to such a soft bed. Each bed had 4 pillows, a down comforter, and a light blanket if we opted for that. Another review said it was hard to watch TV from their bed, I am not sure if that person knew it or not or if this is specific to the deluxe rooms, but, the stand the tv is on swivles to face either bed or the chair in the room, so neither of us had any issue with the boob tube. The delux room also had plenty of towles and a bathrobe in the bathroom. This hotel has a very central location, most of the local attractions are within a mile of the hotel, but, wear comfortable shoes because you will do alot of walking. As for the food, we had a hot soup and dessert in the steak house down stairs. The soup was ok but the cheescake was amazing. Also, the wine guy really knows his stuff. We had one drink in the big bar because it was there, nothing amazing and I had ordered on of the special drinks (Big Blue). After going out to dinner in Chicago, the prices for drinks there were just about average, but, we got the normal size drinks. Yes, I must say this hotel is geared more to a business travler, the morning we left I wanted to print out my boarding pass before going to the airport, just to find out there is a $7 fee for using the computer in the business office and $1 per page charge for a print out (I took a pass). Also, If you rent a car, you dont need one, there is a steap parking charge, but, there are garages around the corner you can use for 1/2 the price. All in all I enjoyed this hotel.

The windows were bolted shut, too, so opening them was not an option.

Yes the check-in lines can be that long. I stayed at this hotel this President's day weekend, first time in Chicago, and I have to say the only way I tolerated the chaos there was because of the good deal I got on Travelocity. It's a huge hotel, the most visible feature is their bar called 'BIG' which serves 20 oz. martinis to middle-aged conventioneers and 19 year olds for $20 to $30 bucks. It's a cool place if you're traveling alone, it's amusing and disturbing in a Super-sized American kind of way...feels like Disneyland inside, way too much going on, fat people with fanny packs left and right, drunk soccer moms and their bored children, overly-made up teenagers in tafetta and cheap polyester roaming about the ballrooms with Coronas in their hands, and IT nerds convening in the lobby with their laptops... it's a freakin' madhouse...

Since I saw a 4-star Hotel available in the Hotwire for $53 (total $70 including service charge), I thought it was pretty good deal. Therefore, I paid for it and I got this hotel. So far, these are the negative experience I seldomly have had in a 4-star hotel: - The lobby likes a central terminal It seemed that there was a conference meeting during the period I stayed in this hotel. A lot of people stayed in the lobby. They spoke very loud and noisy. More than 30 people smoked in the lobby, surprisingly, nobody stopped them. (Usually, smoking is not allowed in the indoor in USA.) I can't believe that it happened in a 4-star hotel. - The wall is too thin I can hear the conversation from the people in the next door completely and clearly. Also, if someone knock the next door, I can hear it too. The wall is just too thin that can't block any sound at all. - TV is in a wrong position The TV is on the right side of the bed. It is hard to watch the TV on the bed. - Running water in the bathroom After flushing the toilet, the water will keep throwing. This sound is so annoyed and I have to close the door before going to sleep. - Fair River View When I checked in, I was told that my room came with a full city and river view. However, half of the river view is blocked by the other buildings. If you are a photographer and you need a good river view, I suggest you go to Hotel 71. It is few blocks away from Hyatt and it is on the same street. Their view is excellent. - The comforter is not comfortable The comforter was not clean and it made my body itchy. Well, there are serveral advantages: - Excellent Bell service. Since the check out time is 12pm and I have to leave Chicago at 6pm, it is not convenient to carry my luggage around. Therefore, I stored my luggages through their Bell service. They handled my luggage carefully. Their service is excellent and helpful. - Excellent Check-in and Check-out service. The service is fast and the persons are very friendly and helpful. - Excellent room service Last time when I stayed in Hotel 71, the room service was at 9am while I was sleeping. This time, no body disturb me. It's good. - Excellent Location It is just 5 minutes walk to the River Bridge on the Michigan Ave. It is about 10 minutes walk to the Grand and Lake Subway stations.

There was a chair with ottoman in the room, which was nice. By far the worst thing about the stay was it cost $39 a night to park. (I've paid less for hotel rooms.) My advice on parking: leave your car at the Millennium Park Garage for between $12 and $15.75 a day. Millennium is the massive city owned lot designed for downtown events and offers clean, well-marked, underground parking. Thanks to the hotel's central location, it is just 2 blocks away. The garage is accessible from Columbus Drive between Randolph and Monroe streets. In addition to the actual price of parking, the Hyatt systematically over bills as well: first, charging for multiple days, even if you check your car out after the first, and second assessing for 48 hours of parking even if you use 30 hours or less, so watch out. Hyatt knows the practice is wrong, but has chosen not to change it. They will however adjust incorrect charges at your request, but it's a hassle, especially when you are checking out. The room upgrades offered totaled $30. Hyatt said they would provide a slightly upgraded room for this with a somewhat better view out of the window. We declined, and our standard room turned out just fine. The hotel also has lots of bellhops. My daughter got a kick out of their presence. The downside, of course, is that they can drive the cost of your stay up. That said, they are a lot cheaper than the parking, and fun for the kids. By the way, I stayed here about 10 years ago in my only other visit to this hotel. Back then the cabbies became upset enough that they were getting hit up for kickbacks for higher end (O'Hare) fares that they drove around the hotel all night with their horns blaring trying to wake up the guests.

Like many others, I used Priceline paid $70 and with all other charges from Priceline paid $100 total. When I got my priceline choice and went on Expedia to see how I did, the hotel was at $113.00. The comments about modern decor are true....the decor is fine. The people were very nice and if you called down for your car, you did not have to wait long. Chicago is a very expensive city and I usually spend at least $200 a night or more. It was nice to save money........but having to clean the bathroom and wonder what was on the bed...made one thing for sure: I will never book at the Hyatt Regency again.

We purchased our room off of Priceline for $75 and we inquired about an upgrade to a suite when we checked in. The upgrade would have been an additional $150 so we opted not to do the upgrade. We had requested a refrigerator for our room and they waived the $25 fee for that since we had an infant with us. The room that we got had an awesome view of Navy Pier and we enjoyed the fireworks from our window on Wednesday night. The bed was VERY comfortable. The only downfall was the paper-thin walls and the connecting doors between the rooms. On the first night, I could hear the guy next to us snoring throughout the night. Needless to say, our infant heard him too so mom and baby didn't sleep good the first night. Thank goodness he checked out and we had a better night's sleep the next night. After we checked out, we came back to the hotel to pick up our luggage (after shopping all day) and Angie at the Assistant Manager's desk was VERY helpful with giving us a temporary suite to use so that I could privately breastfeed our infant.

After reading other reviews, we were a little concerned, but kept the reservation because of the good rates. We are Gold Passport members and had no trouble or wait checking in, but we were not offered an upgrade. We had standard rooms on the 21st floor. We did not encounter any problems with noise, but the rooms did have limited drawer space and counter space in the bathroom. My father's room was clean, but our bedspread had an unidentifiable stain on it and one of the pillowcases had black marks. We switched the pillow with a spare in the closet (clean) and my husband called the front desk to request a clean spread. We then went down to have dinner in the hotel restaurant and the bedspread was replaced when we returned. We also received a follow up call to make sure the clean bedspread had been sent up. Our biggest complaint with the hotel was the elevators. We stayed in the west tower, and waited, at times, up to 20 minutes to get from our floor to the lobby. When the hotel is at high capacity, the best thing to do is get on any elevator that has room, even if it is going up and you want to go down. We heard many other people complaining about this as well. We only ate at the All Seasons Cafe which I highly recommend. The food is very good, especially breakfast, and the prices were reasonable.

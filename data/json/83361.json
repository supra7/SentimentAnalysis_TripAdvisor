It is a great spot if you are looking to enjoy the beach and what San Diego has to offer. The hotel has amazing gardens and a private beach. We took our children age 3 and 6 with us and this hotel make it stress free. They suite we had was bran spanking new and I think we were the first one to ever use the kitchen in it. The kitchen area had a full size fridge and that was amazing to find in a hotel today. Everything was new from the bed to the TV. It looks like they are almost finished with all the rooms being renovated. Our suite had a huge balcony that over looked the bay. We would end our day with a glass of wine relaxing and watching an amazing sunset. They have a cocktail boat that is free for the guest and if you bring kids you have to go early because at some point they restrict it to just 21 and up. Another great thing about this resort is that you can drive up to your room so hauling all the beach toys and luggage was easy. We love that the parking is free, especially since we are at the beach. The also do not charge for the internet and that was great. While we were their we asked about the summer rates and they were a bit higher but when we called their reservations line they told us about their face book page and if you become a fan on it you can save 15% using their link off the page. We booked our summer and saved a bunch. We are already looking forward to our July trip.

This place is like the beach cabin your parents rented when you were a kid (if you were a kid in the 70s or early 80s). Why I love it: I got a huge studio with an econo-kitchen for a great price. My kids had their own bed (family of 4) that wasn't a pull-out sofa. Our room was right on the edge of the resort, which is surrounded by sandy, quiet beaches. You can almost always find a side that isn't windy. The staff was irreverant and great. I lived in San Diego for long enough to know that you don't go to San Diego without renting a car. The hotel is close to everything, when you are talking about Southern California close. There's a freeway everywhere you drive and very few things are walkable. Also, cabs are super expensive.

The Bahia is also conveniently located to all major beaches and attractions in San Diego which makes family trips there very conveniant and enjoyable for all ages. I have and would definately recommend the Bahia to friends and family members looking to spend some time away in San Diego.

It is close to Sea World and other family oriented attractions. My taxi from the airport was $25 including tip. There is also a shuttle from the airport that makes multiple stops and is $12 per head. If you drive your own car, you will be able to part for free near your room. While there is no taxi queue, the hotel has an agreement with the local Yellow Cab to dispatch cabs on call. When I checked out to got to the airport, the cab was there in about three minutes. The hotel also has an agreement with Yellow Cab for a flat $20 fare to the airport. While some of the family attractions are within walking distance, the hotel will arrange shuttles or taxis to others or to shopping. My taxi dropped me under a port corcher and I entered a small neat reception area. This intimate area, along with the cafe and lounge, comprise the interior public spaces of the hotel. There was no real gathering spaces in which to meet other guests. I did find the guests open and welcoming in the cafe and lounge. Check-in was OK. I did not have to wait. I was surprised that my credit card was put in an imprinter, rather than just scanned, and that I had to fill out my name and address. While it was not yet the \"check-in time\" and while there were a few people waiting for their rooms, my room was ready. They offered help with my luggage but I did not use it. Directions to my room were offered and clear. Rooms open to the outside and the walk-ways were not covered. I happened to arrive on one of the 20 days a year where that matters in southern California. The design and decor are north African but not too cutesy. The furnishings were ample and sturdy but not terribly creative. I had a parlor suite with a very large living and dining space and a small bedroom. There was a fully equipped kitchenette. There was a small range with oven. a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and Toaster. There was even a garbage disposal. There was a sliding door to a full-size deck with two lounges. My room overlooked a small beach, a small marina accomodating boats up to forty feet, and beyond that the harbor. Closet space was adequate for two for a few days but might have been tight for a family of four for a week. Drawer space, on the other hand, was very good. The lavatory offered two bowls and a large mirror. There was a private room for the tub and the toilet. The shower was in-tub and offered the curved shower curtain bar that some of us have come to like. Plumbing is modern, hot water is ready, and flow was good. There was a hair-dryer, ironing board, and iron. There was a telephone and a large flat-screen TV in both rooms. In addition to about 30 TV channels both offered current-in-theater movies. The one in the living room had a keyboard and joy-stick for internet access and games. The hotel offers free Wifi Internet access in rooms, conference rooms, and public spaces. The access code was on my check-in sheet and was pointed our to me on check-in. It was difficult to guess but easy to remember. Access, coverage, and speed were good I never saw a housekeeper but every time that I returned to the room everything was freshened and in its place. Food was excellent, portions, generous, and prices moderate. I ordered the Wedge and Rock Shrimp Macaroni and Cheese. They offered to box what I left and I got a great lunch the next day. For families, order family style. They serve in the Bahia Cafe with al fresco dining, and the Tangier Lounge. I ate breakfast in the Cafe (a little chilly and damp for al fresco that day) and dinner at the bar in the Tangier. Service was informal and personal. Guests were gentile, friendly, and in resort attire. Incidentally the Tangier has antique belt-driven ceiling fans; a nice touch. There are guest washers and dryers and an outside valet offering one-day service but no on-premise laundry or dry cleaning. Other amenities include spa, swimming pool, fitness center, video arcade, playground, tennis, shuffle board, gift shop, ATM, and business center. There is also a marina adjacent to be property that offers sailboats and powerboats for rental. The hotel operates a 2-deck paddle-wheel boat for dinner and harbor cruises. There is no charge but space is limited so ask for a ticket. For groups, the catering was very good. We got everything we asked for promptly and unobtrusively. In addition to our four hour meeting We had a sit-down dinner for 15 people. I had the prime rib, served with salad, potatoes, carrots, asparagus, and dessert; excellent. One last word. There was adequate staff and active management. I enjoyed the gardens and the lighting. On one stroll I noticed that a ground light had been smashed.

Our first impression of the property was that it seemed very lush with mature tropical plants, giving us the feeling that we were visiting an exotic tropical resort. Upon entering our room, we found it to be clean, but the furniture seemed to be somewhat worn. Thankfully, my girlfriend isn't the type to act like a princess, so it didn't seem to matter. The bed was nice, and the proximity to the beach was fantastic. Our breakfasts were included in the 3 night reservation (thanks to Allegiant Vacations) and we were very happy with the service and quality of food. The prices on the a la carte menu were very reasonable, so we were not restricted to eating from the buffet. Upon checkout, we made our way to the airport and with less than an hour to go for our flight back to Bellingham, we realized that I'd forgotten to take our passports out of the hiding spot in the drawer in our room. Frantically, I phoned the front desk of the hotel and asked if they could find them for us and send it in a cab to the airport terminal, as we had no time to come and go. This is where the service gets very impressive: - the bellman Cody, offered to drive our passports himself to us so that we could make the flight and not have us worry about a cab driver potentially messing up the situation. 20 minutes later, he showed up with our passports, just in time for us to make the flight :) So all in all, I'd say with all the positives that we'd experienced during our stay, we found that the dated furniture was very insignificant and probably allows the Bahia resort to be as affordable as it is. We will definitely stay there again soon.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "AprilAnnLV", "ReviewID": "UR118570037", "Content": "I will admit, I read the reviews on here after I booked our trip and was very disappointed as to what I might find when I arrived at the Bahia. For the duration of our vacation I was actually looking for something to complain about the Bahia so I could justify the reviews, but it never happened. Our check-in was smooth and we got a fantastic Bay View Room. Our big balcony overlooked the bay right outside our room. The room was large and clean, and had a kitchenette with full-size fridge and sink, microwave, coffee-maker, stove, and cupboards supplied with pots, pans, cups, and silverware. The bathroom was very clean and had an outside vanity area. Our king-size bed was comfortable. The room also had a sofa sleeper (which we did not use), 2 bar stools, 3 chairs and a table. We had asked the hotel for a crib for our toddler and when we went up to our room the crib was already there waiting for us. The hotel grounds are gorgeous! Lush landscaping everywhere! There is a large pond spread throughout all the foilage and trees and it has acquired a few resident ducks. There is also a seal pond where the resort holds their rescued seals. We watched the daily feedings several times~such a nice perk to a resort. The gift shop was tidy and held a variety of souvenirs. We ate breakfast at the cafe almost every morning and the food was fantastic. I would say the pricing is average for a resort cafe ($8/meal for breakfast). I'm not sure what people expect when they are on vacation? There are a few fast food places around that have cheap food, but we were on vacation and wanted nice meals. We ordered room service and it was promptly delivered and the order accurate. My husband accidentally left his wallet on the tray after we were done eating our food. We put the tray outside our room and left it for room service to pick up. We heard a knock on our door about an hour later and an honest hotel employee returned my husband's wallet to us...with everything in it! We visited Sea World (2 mile walk) and walked Bay Side a few times to surrounding restaurants and stores. There is a store just up towards the pier that you can stock up on necessaties and food. We wanted to check out Belmont Park, but when we arrived they were closing at 5PM. Their hours posted were that they were open till 8PM but we were told their hours are subject are to change. I am glad we did not purchase tickets beforhand online and I would strongly recommend not doing that since the appear to be open and closed on their own schedule. The hotel staff were always friendly and accomadating to us. The only thing that we were disappointed about was that when we booked our vacation through Sea World Parks we were told the hotel had airport transportation. They do NOT have airport transportation, so this misinformation messed up our travel plans just a little. But this information was given through Sea World, and not the hotel itself.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay and mini vacation near MCRD\u201d", "Author": "kkhoas", "ReviewID": "UR118493330", "Content": "I found the front desk to be very kind and helpful.

Having read all the negative reviews, as discerning and regular travellers, we were filled with great trepidation and so emailed the hotel ahead of time to ensure that the requests we had made to Travelrepublic had been noted; quiet location, bay view and non-smoking. We had a very helpful & reassuring response and even free breakfast for 2 up to the value of $35/day - probably as we were staying for 15 nights which is longer than most. We flew into LA and had a 2\u00c2\u00bd hour drive to the Bahia. Stunning location along the coast, set back from the main road. It had a lovely driveway with exquisitely maintained gardens throughout. Our check in was very smooth with Scott, who was both courteous & charming. We were also delighted with our free upgrade to a suite! Our room was in a 4 storey high block right at the end of the hotel grounds, overlooking the bay. Parking was easy, we always found a space to park near our block. We were absolutely delighted with our suite which was massive & had everything we could possibly need. The firm bed was so comfortable and there were numerous good quality pillows.There was ample storage, large TV, lounge area, well equiped kitchen - we only used the fridge, separate area with a dressing table with plenty of plug sockets and a good sized bathroom with plentiful towels. The balcony overlooked Mission Bay and the marina. As many birds also wanted to enjoy the view, the ground covered with the plastic grass was not as clean as it might have been and the one lounger was rather tatty; no worries we didn't use the balcony apart from to enjoy the view. The air conditioning was effective. The walk from our block to reception was about 3 minutes - perfect as it meant we were well away from the regular weddings that took place. There was a visitor information desk with staff on hand to help you plan trips and print out routes. The hotel had preprinted lists of the main tourist attractions with 'spot on' directions of how to get there - so useful. There was also free high speed high internet access for guests. The inside dining area was pleasant but far more beautiful was outside with lovely large parasols. The choice for breakfast (6.30am - 10.30am, very good timings) was excellent, either a buffet for $14.99 or \u00c3\u00a0 la carte. We opted for the latter and could particularly recommend the American breakfast with delicious bacon and potatoes saut\u00c3\u00a9ed in lemon, the eggs benedict, eggs florentine and granola. Service was sometimes slow, but when you're on holiday does this really matter? We had 3 evening meals there and were less impressed ($9.99 - $15.99 for an entr\u00c3\u00a9e, reasonable but not great food) . One evening there was an outage which affected the whole of California! The hotel supplied us with fluorescent wands and then as we were advised not to drive because the traffic lights weren't working, they cashed in on the opportunity to provide a BBQ at a very steep $15.99 pp. This was very overpriced, the quality of the food poor and there were numerous complaints. There was a small gift shop, the Tangier bar and a lovely landscaped pool for 2 seals who had been rescued by the hotel. The hotel's pool was spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds; occasionally all were occupied but there was always the beach instead. There was a charming, friendly lady who worked at the bar. Bit of a palava though with towels, signing a paper each day to take towels, return the towels then the paper was returned to you. The gym was well kitted out, but we didn't see anyone using it! We loved the beach, a few steps from our block and it was always deserted, so there was no pressure to get there early for beds. The beach was raked daily, the beds were very comfortable and views breathtaking. The hotel was a popular venue for weddings and they took place with great regularity often on the beach, mainly at weekends. Guests would often then transfer to one of the hotel's two paddle steamers for the dinner. For the other, reception desk had free tickets for hotel guests to enjoy a short trip leaving daily from 6.30pm and thereafter an hour later to take you across for the 20 minute ride to one of the sister hotels; The Catamaran Resort Hotel. During the short passage you have time to enjoy the views, have a drink and the live music. Having seen this other hotel which was much more expensive and formal and along a very busy, noisy high road, we were so pleased to be at the Bahia. The Bahia was well situated to visit so many places. We would particularly recommend the Gas Lamp Quarter (eat in Rock Bottom) and Little Italy (eat at Zia's Bistro), less impressed with Sea Port Village. We ate 3 times at Tony Roma's, famous for its amazing ribs, 5 minutes away along Mission Boulevard. We loved the Old Town, really buzzing, the old historic houses to visit, lots of bars and restaurants playing live music. We had been told about Rocking Baja (mexican food) which was outstanding - live band playing Eagles, Beatles etc - wonderful! We visited Coronado Island and walked round the famous Coronado Hotel - beautiful. The upmarket La Jolla is also a must, 15 minute drive. La Jolla Cove with the seals basking on the beach was delightful and take a look at the historic hotel La Valencia. Del Mar, about 20 minutes drive is stunning, the town is pretty and the beach magnificent. Balboa Park, is also 20 minutes away and packed with many interesting museums and galleries to visit. Very good shopping at Fashion Valley, a 10 minute drive away. Ate in two of our favourite restaurants; California Pizza Kitchen and The Cheesescake Factory. There were two good outlets about 30-40 minutes from the hotel; Carlsbad was the better. We loved our day at the Wild Animal Safari Park, about an hour's drive; worth paying the $80 to do the Asia & Africa tours - look for coupons in the magazines, got $7 off pp. As we had done Seaworld, 5 minutes form the hotel and other places on other trips, this holiday was more relaxed and less frenetic. Our stay was made all the more perfect by the hotel ... we can't wait to go back.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cStay Away - unless you like noise and bad service!\u201d", "Author": "jarayner", "ReviewID": "UR118169935", "Content": "Where do I start?

This time, my wife and I were accompanied only by our daughter. Previously, we had stayed at the Paradise Point resort, which is very nice generally, but on our last visit , the beach was a mess and we found ourselves irritated by the extra charges, like parking and internet access, tacked on our bill. Surprise! So, this year, we decided to give another resort a try. After some internet research, we settled on the Bahia. All in all, I would describe the experience as . . . okay. It wasn't as expensive as Paradise Point,and there were no surprise charges. However, our room was a typical mid-range hotel room, not a bungalow as we had at Paradise Point. Bungalows are available, we just didn't get one. The Bahia is old, built with a Moroccan theme that must have been very cool when the Rat Pack was still around. The place is frayed around the edges. One of the couch cushions was torn, and the curtains were a bit ragged. Everything was clean, though, and was kept that way. The staff is friendly, but quite young, and seemed a bit inexperienced. The amenities were not terrible, but did not live up to my expectations, which, admittedly, I had built up in my imagination. The fitness center, which I had imagined as rows of gleaming dumbbells and the latest machines, turned out to be a small room with four treadmills and a home gym. The free arcade, which I unrealistically thought would be a veritable Dave and Buster's, was a small, dark, chilly room with about ten machines of ancient vintage. My daughter liked it, though.The grounds, advertised as lush and tropical, were just that, but were only about twice the size of my front lawn. The private beach was a narrow strip, clean enough, but not ideal for swimming. We did not rent paddle boards or boats, though they were available. The lounge chairs on the beach were elderly, but comfortable. The pool was good, and though the area filled up in the afternoons, it was still possible to get in a decent swim. The tennis courts could host two games at once, but were under some kind of renovation. The cafe was a little pricey, but good for breakfast, and the service was attentive and friendly. Possibly the best thing about our room was the view, morning, afternoon, and night, beautiful. All in all, it was not a bad experience, but neither was it one that will fill me with fond memories in years to come. Whatever inadequacies the resort held were made up for by the city of San Diego, where the weather was beautiful, the food good, and entertainment easy to find, as usual. I would visit San Diego again, I will stay in a resort again, but I don't think I'll go back to the Bahia.

One of the reasons we had chosen this hotel is that it is not on the online bed bug alert list and since we were there only one night we decided to stay because the beds were comfortable and clean and we were only sleeping there. The grounds were lovely, with a small pool in the centre and a nice restaurant to enjoy. It is located on a little jut out peninsula into Mission Bay so you could walk around the hotel too or up the road about 5-10 minutes to the beach which has restaurants, a small amusement park and shops.

Or maybe a lot nervous LOL. Been there. Depending on how many opinions you have read, you are probably staring at the pictures on the website, and looking for the more positive reviews - especially those that tell you not to pay attention to all the bad ones and that the place is actually quite charming and wonderful and that you will have a great time. I understand. I was you. I read all the same reviews; chose to believe the ones I wanted to, looked at the pictures and convinced myself it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that bad. I booked a four night stay in a Bay Front Suite. The location of this property gets this review two stars - and this is generous, very generous. Again, if you have been reading other reviews then you are already worried about the smelly military-bunker quality of many of the rooms here - especially the ones closest to the water. Apparently some of the rooms facing parking lots have been \"upgraded\" but I took a look inside a few of these and was not at all impressed. Our room was old, smelly, dingy, and just gross. The bathroom was nasty with mildew we could see and smell on the shower curtain. We found clumps of dirt on the carpet and actually found a few nuggets of weed on the floor. Not entirely a bad thing, but not with a toddler finding it first. So, assuming you are going to book anyway, LOL, let me at least give you some important advice. Make sure you CALL your reservation in. DO NOT book through Bahia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, or Expedia, or any other method. We booked our stay using the Bahia website, and from that moment we were treated like second class citizens. Not knowing or understanding this of course, I figured that booking through the website was a good idea - it is 2011 after all. I also made a simple request on the reservation for a ground floor room. I also called the reservation desk a few times leading up to our visit with the same request. On our way down to San Diego I called the front desk directly and asked again. Now, I have worked in hotels and I know it is tough to guarantee anything until you are standing in the lobby and the desk clerk checks what is available. I get it. So when after all of this, I was actually booked in to a nice ground floor room I was excited and was prepared to overlook lots of other issues that may have cropped up. The room was not ready when we were checked in since we showed up two hours before check in time - no problem - I expected that. So, we drove around for awhile checking out the area. About a half hour later I got a call from a \"manager\" at the front desk telling me that there was a mistake and that I could NOT have the room we were already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153checked in\" to and that there was no other option or suggestion. This was very disappointing, but again, I am reasonable to a point. When I questioned this further I was told point blank that my reservation was booked online and therefore I was being bumped from the room in favor of a guest with the same request who just showed up but who had CALLED in their reservation instead. Again, I booked this reservation using Bahia's own website - NOT Expedia or some other bargain hunting website. I paid the posted rate of nearly $400 per night, but alas, my money, my request, and my family were somehow not as important because I had the nerve to use their website to book. Huh? Seriously, huh? I was floored. I mean, at least make something up that is a little more reasonable than that. Hell, I talked to the Bahia reservation desk several times too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I just booked through the website. I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get this at all. Further attempts throughout our stay to fulfill various requests were all met with a level of disdain and contempt one might expect asking a cranky night clerk at 2:00 a.m. at a roadside Super 8 for three wake-up calls, extra towels, and to come up and fix the TV. To sum, this is definitely not the place for us, and I would strongly caution anyone with expectations higher than a dirty surf shack or your kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tree house to skip it all together.

Not relaxing if you like to sleep - either in the morning or throughout the night.

Very few people were brave enough to get in the water so if you're expecting a beach getaway - don't bother going here. You won't get a beach experience in San Diego.

We were on the Bay side with a main floor suite- pull out couch bed in living area (even though our reservation said 2 queen beds...), and a room with a queen bed. The room was old, the mattress on the bed was very uncomfortable, the pull out couch bed wasn't bad though. We had an infestation of little sugar ants- no big deal, other than that the room was clean and not moldy or musty. The bedroom window has shutter windows so that the sound from the parking lot- right outside the room was very loud. Also when room 140 was shutting their door- they slam- it felt like they were in our bed with us. Our room was next to the housekeepers closet room, so not ideal for sleeping in. I'm told 131 is the concierge's favorite room, although old- it does not have noisy feet above it (like ours did) and is on the corner- so neighbor only on one side. I'm also told that the 300 level rooms are the best right on the water. Their view is obstructed though by the two large \"paddle\" style ships that are moored there and it is on the boardwalk that you would take to go to Mission Blvd- so lots of eyes outside your sliding door. I liked the location of our room because it was more private. You walked out the slider and right onto a patio, then grass, then sand, then water- NICE! The bay was perfect for floating, renting boats, sailing and laying out on the loungers that they have. There is a public beach right on the other side, but lots of vegetation make it difficult to walk through on the beach side. The towers have been remodeled, they look like they have great views, but they overlook the public beach which had lots of people, parties, hangers out. The people at the resort were very nice and the pizza in the restaurants was very good. The breakfast we had at the resort was good too. The pool was awesome (not large, no slides or anything like that- just a nice hotel style pool with a hot tub.) They have a nice workout room with treadmills- good air conditioning in there and next to that is the video game room- all the games are free!! Very popular with our family- Golden Tee and car race games. My understanding is that they are remodeling the resort one section at a time. Although the tower rooms are better, I don't like their location as well and we wanted to be right on the sand. The weather on the bay was better than the beach- not as windy and cloudy.

I could not find a speck of dirt anywhere in the kitchen or bath. The daily cleaning staff did even more than I expected, which included washing our dishes. I couldn't find a note to let housekeeping know we didn't require fresh linens every day, (to conserve energy), but I couldn't find such a note that is found in most hotels these days. First night we strolled their extensive and mature gardens and marveled at the sheer quantity of lush palms, flowering trees and pond and fountains. We said hello to the blind harbor seals, now safe in a habitat at the Bahia. Checked out their nice giftshop and bought discount tickets to San Diego Zoo there, as well as some snacks and drinks. The lounge at the Bahia is really fun. Walk through a Morroccan door and you feel like you are in a movie set with crazy fan contraption overhead.

We continued the walk ten minutes to Belmont Park (amusement park) and California party beach, Mission Beach.

We saw an entire wing of the resort is being renovated. They were putting in new rugs and furniture while we were there.

It was only going to be for four days, with us doing a lot of sightseeing during the day, so whatever we got we could deal with. What a wonderful surprise! We had a kitchenette suite near the beach. It was large, clean, and inviting. And quiet, too! We met many people in the hall during our stay, but nothing interrupted the peace of our room. Did the TV have a lot of channels? No, but who comes to San Diego to watch TV anyway? And to the guy complaining about where the TP holder was placed, how come my 5 yr old could reach it and you couldn't? Get a grip. Every morning, we would leave our room to go to the dining room. It was a beautiful walk with flowers and friendly people. Every person, from the gift shop, to the groundskeepers wished us a good morning, and were extremely helpful when asked questions. In the dining room, we were offered a delicious and affordable buffet, with the most helpful waitresses ever. Thanks, Jean, for making us feel at home, teasing my girls, and getting us the weather forecast every moring so we could plan our day. When walking out to the beach for the free boat trip around Mission Bay, I couldn't help noticing how clean the beach was kept. My girls enjoyed the small playground and the sand (I wasn't afraid of them taking off their shoes). The trip around the bay at dusk was beautiful, and the boat crew were very good about answering questions about the area. Normally, when visiting hotels, I refrain from using the pool and hot tub, as I usually find them dirty, but here, there was a large pool that was in very good condition. The staff also went so far as to stretch lane ropes across the pool where the depth changed so that children wouldn't be taken by surprise. The hot tub, as well, was taken care of very well. Both pools were clean, well lighted, well maintained, with safety devices in place. As a former lifeguard, I have very high standards, and was very impressed. The location of this resort is perfect. We came for SeaWorld (5 minutes away) and the San Diego Zoo (20 minutes away), but found that it was fast and easy to get over to Ocean Beach for dinner too. It is close to the airport, the train station, and the car rental places (all of which we used). The pictures on the website do not lie when they show the beautiful surroundings and gardens here. Is this a 5 star resort? No, and it doesn't profess to be. But, did we get treated like 5 star guests? Absolutely, and I can hardly wait to visit the Bahia again.

The most important issue is that this hotel was unsafe for children. The balcony on our second floor room had rails that were spaced easily a foot apart; we were terrified that our daughter would get out there and climb right through them to a fall in the concrete below. Secondly, even when bolted, the doors open from the inside simply by pulling our the door handle. Our child could easily have exited the room and run into the parking lot behind. The second issue was the noise level. The hotel has virtually no soundproofing. The windows facing the public beach are single paned which provided no sound insulation for the party that was happening on the adjacent public beach. Worse still, the bedroom windows are louvered, and certainly have never been replaced since the 1960's or 70's. This provided no sound proofing from the constant foot traffic at all hours of the night passing as we were trying to sleep. Worse still, security made no efforts to eliminate noise of rambunctious guest which occurred all through the night. There was a very loud party in the room below us which went on until 11;00 Pm before we finally had to call security ourselves as they were obviously not patrolling the area. Although the loud guest did leave temporarily, they returned at 2 am when the bars closed. I perhaps got two hours sleep the night we stayed here. Finally, the hotel vastly over-represented the quality of the hotel. Our room looked like a 1970's museum. I'm sure nothing from the bedding to the lighting to the flooring has ever been replaced. Worse, the old plumbing creates unbearable noise. When our neighbor turned on the shower at 5:00 in the morning, we were sure a poltergeist was shaking the walls. The outrageous price that is charged for this room is for location only.

We booked with this hotel because it was recommended by several friends familiar with the San Diego area. We're so glad we went with this hotel. The location on Mission Bay was perfect for all of our activities. We were within close driving distance of La Jolla, downtown San Diego, and Coronado, without having to pay an arm and a leg for parking. It was one of the few hotels we found in our preferred areas that offered free parking...and plenty of it! We were also able to walk from the hotel to Belmont Park and Mission Beach, which was nice. We stayed in room 491, on the fourth floor of the tower all the way at the end of the road. While it's a longer walk to get from that building to the pool and the restaurant, we had no issues with noise from the reception areas, as I've seen other people complain about on here. We booked a Bay View Studio, which had a king size bed, a sofa and arm chair around a coffee table, a small dining table with two chairs, and a kitchen with microwave, toaster, stove and oven, full-size refrigerator, sink with garbage disposal, and a pass-through with a breakfast bar and two stools. We also had a balcony with a great view of the bay and a lounge chair. The accommodations were clean and comfortable for the two of us. Housekeeping always kept the towels, tissues, toilet paper, and bath products refilled, which is something we've had problems with in other hotels. The amenities at the property were great, too. They have two lighted tennis courts (which we did not use), a heated pool and jacuzzi (LOVED that jacuzzi!), an exercise area and arcade, an indoor/outdoor restaurant and bar, and shaded lounge chairs on their private bay beach. They also offer bicycle and water sport rentals. On Friday and Saturday nights, they offer hotel guests free cruises on the bay on their Bahia Belle boat. (This is offered nightly in the summer, but we stayed in November.) Non-guests can pay $10 and enjoy trips back and forth the bay to the Catamaran Hotel. There are family hours and over-21 hours, a bar, and live entertainment. We spent an hour on the boat on Saturday night and had a really great time. Our favorite part of the Bahia is the seal pool. They've rescued two blind harbor seals and they live in a pool near the lobby. You can watch their feedings twice a day, and they were a treat to see as we came and went from the hotel. As adults, we found them so entertaining. If you're traveling with kids, they will love this added bonus. The only real negative we experienced was noise from our neighbors. I've read complaints about noise at the Bahia, but I don't blame the hotel for what we heard. I blame the parents. There was a family staying next door with at least two young children and every day from 6-8 am, we were treated to high-pitched screaming. This wasn't an issue of a fussy baby, these were young children playing. When they weren't yelling inside, they were yelling outside and the noise from the balcony was even worse. We had no noise issues with any other neighbors...reasonable volumes can't be heard between the walls. But if you're unfortunate enough to be next to a room with parents who can't or won't discipline their children and remind them that they aren't at home, then you might have a problem. Even with that, I would return to the Bahia.

The carpet was filthy and I was uncomfortable setting my belongings near the floor. The staff was very good and upgraded all of us (for more money). We all ended up in a modernized wing but my room was still too dark for my liking. While we were upgrading, a couple of newlyweds came back into front desk after seeing their room.

There was a wedding (or weddings?) going on so lots of doors slamming and people talking in the parking lot behind our room (which was where the bedroom was located). Even louder parties the following night. To me it was a minor annoyance and thankfully it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep my 4 yr old awake. The Bahia Caf\u00c3\u00a9 had decent food and great service.

There was also a small kitchen that was stocked with dishes, mugs and pots & pans (no silverware; I assume you need to request it). The showers did not have the best water pressure. The full-size bed was really too small and not comfortable to sleep on. Housekeeping wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the ball; we left our room for 4.5 hours and they did not visit during that time. Instead they called us at 4pm and asked if they could clean the room but we had to decline since our son was napping.

The full kitchen is great and saved us a ton of money. Room was large and held our lots of our stuff. A few hundred feet from our room was a choice of a public or private beach. We mainly stayed at the private beach. Water was shallow and calm. Shaded and cushioned chairs were provided. Sand was very clean and soft. Hotel is acrosss the street from the ocean and Belmont Park. Our children, ages 2-11, had a wonderful time. Easy commute to Sea World and the Zoo as well as downtown. Friday and Sat night offered a free cruise on the Riverboat Bahia Belle. It was a beautiful 1 hour journey between the Bahia and the Catamaran resort. Again, fun for kids and free!

We love the vintage look and style of the hotel -- it's definitely not a cookie-cutter motel like similarly priced options. You can't beat the location -- a private beach on Mission Bay, 5 minutes from Sea World, a few blocks from Mission Beach and Belmont Park, and a quick drive from hundreds of dining options in the Pacific Beach area. The lush grounds are immaculately landscaped, the rooms are private and most have a stunning view. The patio of our room was shaded by a canopy of ancient knarled trees and was just steps away from the private beach. Each morning our 4-year-old daughter delighted in feeding the flock of ducks that made their rounds around the resort. The hotel also houses two blind harbor seals that are a joy to watch. The hotel has a great pool with a large heated spa and free pool towels. We swam every night. For older kids, there is a free arcade located off the pool area. The fitness center looked nice, although we didn't use it. The restaurant is okay. The service is fine and it is very kid-friendly. The food is not bad and is fairly affordable. The breakfast buffet is a convenient stop before a busy day of fun and sight-seeing. There are a lot of great restaurants to the northeast in the Pacific Beach neighborhood just a short drive away. The rooms are acceptable. Ours have always been clean and comfortable. (My husband is an exterminator and always inspects every room we stay in for bedbugs -- nothing ever noted here at the Bahia.) The furnishings are not luxurious, but are usable and comfortable. We particularly enjoy the privacy afforded by the layout of the rooms. We have never had a problem with finding parking close to our room. In response to the many bad reviews on this site: This is definitely not a 5-star luxury resort. It is a clean, comfortable, friendly place that is conveniently located to all the fun that San Diego offers. I would not consider it a \"destination resort\", although it does offer a lot for the price we pay for our rooms. Speaking of price, I would not advise booking a room directly from the resort, as their \"rack rates\" are pretty high for what the hotel is. Book through a tour company like Get Away Today and you will save a lot of money and will definitely get your money's worth. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a comfortable, clean room with a private beach, a nice pool, a great location and beautiful vintage surroundings.

Read this !!\u201d", "Author": "chowdahead76", "ReviewID": "UR65824261", "Content": "Just got back in town from a 4 day 3 night stay at the Bahia . Before I start with this review allow me to tell you that I am your average 40 hour a week worker . Not rich , not poor . Just middle class family man . So if you fall into this category then this review is perfect for you ......... You ( like I did ) probably read all these reviews about the Bahia , and probably had your head spinning trying to figure out what to believe . I will put all the questions to rest . The staff seemed fairly friendly . In all honesty other than checking in/out you never see them again . We paid $118 a night for 3 nights to stay in a garden view suite with a kitchen room 480 . The Room itself .......... Met all my expectations and then some . Very very clean . Nothing wrong with it at all . Very good sized . In fact you can spend more money on a Bay view suite ( which is on the other side of the hallway facing the bay ) , but to be honest with you its not necessary . From our room you could see a long stretch of the beach anyway . So not really feasable to pay for the upgrade unless you MUST see nothing but water . If there is one thing that one could argue its the size of the bathroom . You literally have room to stand in the bathroom , or jump in the shower . They chose to make the living space larger and a smaller bathroom instead which didnt really bother me , but some people may be annoyed with it . The shower was a bit odd cause the shower head was literally at neck level . I am only 5-9 so I know its not because I am tall . lol I had to duck down a bit to wash my hair . Again not really a deal breaker when judging a room to me . I care more about size , and cleanliness which this room far exceeded my expectations after reading all those reviews . One thing I will say is that you will see a lot of reviews that claim an \"odor\" . I cannot pinpoint it , but when you first walk into your room there is a odor . Not a good smell , but not a bad smell either . The best I can explain is that I have stayed in beach front hotels in Maine , and N.H. before , and it honestly just seems to be a smell that comes with an ocean front hotel . So anyone familiar with the beach can probably relate to what I mean . If it was a terrible smell I would have said something , but it just smelled beachy ! The Grounds ...... Pretty darn good I must say . Now I dont want to say flawless like the Hawaii resort I once stayed at , but very nice surrounding features without a doubt . Lots of tropical plants , palms , flowers etc..... And everything from what I saw was well maintained and clean . The Beach .......... The beach was great . You are a 10 minute walk or a 2 minute car drive to the main beach with the waves , stores , shops etc... or if you just stay on site you are on a nice secluded sandy beach where the peninsula ends . We took the kids for a walk every morning and evening , and saw maybe 5 people total . The water is also a tad bit warmer there than the main beach . The Bahia was a great stay for us . I would rate it a 8 star of out 10 . Again its not Maui , but considering the fact that we have stayed at hotels in hotel circle for $150 a night . I would take the Bahia over those places at the price we paid in a heartbeat . Definitely above average stay . Great food , very nice room , and pretty cool beach too . If you have any questions about this resort , or the surrounding area please feel free to email me at Chowdahead76@yahoo.com We were here for a vacation with the kids that included the beach , Disneyland , California Adventure Park , and Seaworld . So we are familiar with the area if you have any questions .", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThis is no resort\u201d", "Author": "Jack71311", "ReviewID": "UR65777615", "Content": "This is not a resort on the beach.

I was staying with my youngster, so upgraded in advance to a suite so I wouldn't have to go to bed too early. The room was sadly disappointing for the high price (did not look like the website) because everything was old and grungy. Carpet was threadbare and falling apart, ancient astroturf on the balconies, 70's furniture and weird room layout, was supposed to have a full sized fridge but it was still a bar fridge. The bathroom had splatters of old toothpaste on the tile by the sink and no where to put your toiletries, no fan to control the humidity. The bedroom beds were comfortable, furniture dinged and a rubby gruncy gas fireplace (unsealed! can you say CO2, not that we used it - but ick). I checked every morning for bedbug bites, and appeared to have maybe one. We would come back from Seaworld to let my boy nap and at 2pm the room was not 'cleaned' - and then they would finally come around but I didn't want my boy to be disturbed, but even on the days when they did come around it appears that cleaning consists of replacing towels. In 7 nights, my room was 'cleaned' 3 times. Location is great as it is walking distance to the beach and Seaworld, but that's about it. Bus service is right outside, easy to get anywhere on a couple of bucks and 10 minute bus to Old Town transit centre. Staff was friendly enough. Never ate at the hotel. Boat cruise was nice, and we could see the fireworks from our balcony. Annoying school bus showed up and idled outside our room for 20 minutes at 6:30am then shut off then start up at 8:30 again!, and then again in the evening at 9pm - it would arrive and idle and then finally shut off, not sure why you need to pre-warm a bus up 2 hours before you are going anywhere and I certainly did not need to wake at 6:30 on my vacation! Bus should have had to park out by the highway! With my 'upgrade' (ha ha), I paid probably $200/night - way too much for this dump.

The friendly front desk clerk moved us (for $35 more per night) to a studio in the (very ugly) tower at rear of complex.

This room is a marked improvement over the first as far as decor and cleanliness, but I still feel so icky from that first room I'm reluctant to sit down.

The bathroom featured white tile floors and walls and became very steamed up after a quick shower. The tiles were slightly dirty and a few were even cracked and needed replaced. I did not dine in the restaurant at all during the course of my stay. The pool and work out area were quite nice for a hotel in its price category. One of the amenities the hotel features is a free boat cruise of the surrounding harbor. The hotel's boat cruises hourly during the day for family cruises. At night, the boat becomes a floating bar were you must be twenty one to be on the boat. Overall, a nice hotel with a great hotel.

No one knew and no one offered to find out (even though the shop ended up being practically next door). I told them about the urine smell on the couch and the response was a tepid \"oh really?\" The desk clerk said she'd send a maid in to see about the couch but, as we were checking out, that didn't help us.

Other pluses include free parking, internet service and room service. I also heard that the Bahia Belle at the pier takes hotel guests on free bay cruises during certain months. In any event, I stayed at the Bahia with some family members in December and a couple of them received the fourth night free. They have some other fantastic packages on their website where you have the opportunity to save even more; for example, there are discounted rates for an extended stay (2 nights or more), plus other packages or discounts to local attractions. They will even arrange for a spa treatment at Catamaran. Currently, winter rates are about $99, but at the time we stayed the minimum was about $119 for a garden view. In December, we stayed at a bayfront double room at $159, which was still a good deal considering the views and amenities. The room was contemporary and comfortable. It had a kitchenette, sofa bed, patio, and even had its own ipod docking pad! The staff was wonderful as well; they were accommodating and friendly. If you don't like your room, do request another one. We had a breakfast buffet one morning at the cafe and drinks another night at the bar, but there are also plenty of choices to eat nearby. Other nearby attractions (besides Sea World) include Belmont Park - inexpensive fun for the whole family - and don't miss free sunsets at Mission Beach; or you can just relax at the hotel's bayfront beach.

'Bay View Suite', is large suite type room with two queen beds and a convert couch.

It is close to Mission Bay, Belmont Park, Sea World and a host of other area attractions. Secondly, there is a bit of quaint-ness associated with the hotel that make it interesting...a small lagoon with rescued harbor seals and a small private beach (with a completely blocked view due to bloats in the slips) add a certain charm. That is where the luxuries end. We stayed in a bay view suite. The room had an ok layout, but was tighter than I imagined from looking at the photos online. The curtains, beddings and other tapestries were at least 20 years old. The carpet was shameful, stained, ratty and in worse condition than any place I've EVER stayed (rental apartments included). The room included a small kitchen, I considered this to be a plus...until I entered the room. The hotel is next to a small bay where one might rise early to fish; apparantly the previous guest had done just that and proceeded to clean those fish right in the kitchen. Upon opening the doors the first time I was met with an offensive odor that seemed to permeate the entire suite. I believe that the fisherman may have cleaned fish in the sink and then garbage disposal-ed the remains and guts. The smell lasted the entire stay. Next, we had intended to eat dinner at the hotel restaurant but missed the serviing hours due to traffic. We ordered room service and were truly disappointed. We were served leftovers from that morning's lunch buffet. The salad was limp and nothing resembled anything fresh. The house champagne shared by my husband and I was more like Squirt soda. In addition, we were told our food would arrive within 40 minutes. Over an hour later it finally arrived. With three small children in tow, waiting that long for food is not acceptable. After dinner I planned to get the kids settled down by purchasing a movie from the television system...at a price of close to $15.00 per movie we decided against it and we drifted off to sleep while watching the local news. There were other things that led to our disappointment as well: a lack of supervision in the pool area, where a large team of teenage soccer players took over the hot tub and proceeded to \"dive\" into the spa, splash and worst of all...wipe their runny noses on their hands and them rinse them in the water (this is where we got up and left). In addition, as spa owners, we were very concerned that the spa did not appear to be heated properly...as it was several degrees too low. The worst part of our stay happened four days after we checked out. I looked at my online banking statement and found that the hotel had overcharged me by $438.00! I phoned the front desk and was told that it was a system error. The woman didn't seemed surprised at all, and stated that it was happening to a lot of people. That I should call my bank. She then gave me a number to an accounting department to call in the morning to have the charge reversed...I just phoned and that number has been disconnected. I can understand a billing error...but considering the fact that she knew and was aware of this problem I should expect that a \"resort\" would CALL ME immediately and my bank to explain THEIR ERROR. I now have to give up my time to repair their flub. I went to the Bahia for two reasons...they were listed on the Sea World web site and they claimed to be a world class resort.

We booked through a travel service and pre-paid for 5 nights. We only stayed 3. We booked a kitchenette room. We were in the fourt story building at the end of the property. When we entered the room, we noticed a musty smell. We then discovered that the toilet was plugged. The closet doors were not on their tracks, but were leaning against the closet. The sofa had holes in the cushions and you could see the padding. We asked to be placed in another room. We were moved to a room on another floor. This room had a working toilet and the closet doors were connected. However, the sofa was also worn through with stuffing poking out. The carpet was old and threadbare. My wife was afraid to walk on the carpet in bare feet. We had two double beds. These double beds are not large enough to sleep two people, so my son and I tried the pull out bed in the sofa. The pullout bed was worn so that we both rolled to the middle. We could not sleep. The kitchenette had a good woring refrigerator. We did not try the stove. The cupboards were just bare boards when opened. Our first day there we woke up and went to Sea World. We retruned to our room at around 5:00 p.m. and our room had not been visited by the maid yet so we wandered around grounds by the bay for awhile. The second day we were there we were awakened early in the morning by strange noises. We later found out that the building had plumbing problems and they were using a snake to try and clear the sewer lines from the building. The day after the third night there, our toilet plugged. When I called the front desk I was informed that the sewer lines from the building again had problems. sure enough, the snake was again employed. Because we could not sleep, the plumbing prolbems, the run down furnishings and the general disrepair of the room, we left and checked into a different hotel. When we left I spoke to the peson at the front desk who acted if this was not the first time this had happened. The only bright spot was the cruise around Mission Bay on the hotel ship. It is a short \"cruise\" but my family enjoyed it, except for the fact that we are non-smokers and there was no designated smoking area so it was hard to escape smoke. We would never again stay at this hotel.

I was really looking forward to being able to sit and enjoy the view. Parked in the street outside our room were three large motor homes. They were there the whole time of our visit, so we did not see the sea from our room at all. I understand that it is a public road outside, but I doubt very much if it is legal for motor homes to stay there night and day. The reception staff were indifferent to my complaints and not sympathetic at all. From my point of view I did not get what I paid for, so should not have been charged the full amount. I would have been better off having a room near the pool at a lower tariff. If it is common practice for motor homes to park day and night in the street outside then the Bahia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website cannot offer Bay View Deluxe Suites should there not be any Bay Views.

Close to the beach, and Seaworld, only a couple blocks away. Con's: there was a tiny sink with mini-counter with dim lighting, so not great for getting ready. The carpets were very old, dirty, and could stand a cleaning. The bed was very swayed, like with a big dent in the middle, so you couldn't lay flat, which made for a sore back in the mornings. The patio doors were very hard to open/close/lock and didn't come with screens or sheers, only blackout curtains, so if you wanted light you had to rely on very old yellowish lightbulbs, or be open to everyone walking past to view your room.

We did. The main things we were looking for was privacy on the beach, and close to attractions. We stayed in a marina suite at the bahia. As for ratings cleanliness; The room was clean, modern, and well furnished. The grounds were clean, well manicured, and spacious. The restaurant was clean, well staffed, had a great atmosphere ( live music for dinner, aesthetically pleasing ), and very affordable. I have a teenage son so having an buffett bar is very helpful. As for service: whether it was housekeeping, grounds staff, restaurant, or the front desk. Everyone was friendly and acommidating. As for location: hard to get better we had the benefit of a private stretch of beach on mission bay, yet we were only 1 1/2 blocks from the ocean. Close to seworld and an oceanside amusement park. Everything was close,yet we still had privacy. As for value: this is probably the greatest thing that we found out about the Bahia. Unlike some of the other resorts in the area the Bahia doesn't niclke and dime you to death. Other places would have a descent room rate, but then you pay for parking, to use the gym, ect... ect.. At the Bahia parking is free, the gym is free,they have a free arcade, they show movies at the pool at night with free popcorn and soda, you get a free cruise on the paddle boat around mission bay, ect..

The place was quite quiet while we were there and we generally didn't have any issues with noise from the adjacent rooms. The rooms are not what I would describe as gloriously elegant, but they're typical of other resort hotels and were more than adequately furnished. The room was clean and we had everything we needed. The hotel has several rental boats, including kayaks and a little electric boat that held all 3 of us. We had a great time cruising slowly around the bay and we got lots of good pictures. The water in the bay is very calm and there's no surf on the beach -- it's almost like a lake shore. Our 2 year-old loved waking up and going straight out to play on the beach every morning. The beach was very close to our porch, and several families let their kids play on the beach while they sat on the porch.

The kitchenette was just OK as well as the bathroom. Whilst the room was quite large by hotel standards we just felt it was very old and dingy.

I also could not believe that people staying there had dogs in their rooms - absolutely not acceptable in my book and we felt disgusted after realising that animals had slept in our room (sorry if i have offended people but I believe dogs should live outside). We paid just over $800 AUD for our 3 nights and felt ripped off. We walked around the establishment to see if we would upgrade but they all seemed old and dated and I felt we would be wasting our money, so we stuck with our room.

I am the trip-planner of my family and i ALWAYS check out tripadvisor.com before booking any hotels! I truly do not know how this hotel has the rating it has on here! FIRST of all, the pictures on the website for this hotel are extremely deceiving! This is NOT a resort, it is not even an hotel, i would call it a MOTEL...you motor in and park and walk to your rooms. The pool is much smaller than pictured, the \"private beach\" is a bay/marina filled with ships, rental boats, dinner-cruise ships, etc. It's a bay, so this is expected, given, but it is very crowded with vessels up on the beach. (Please be aware, your kids cannot get in this water! Its nasty, like any harbor would be. AND the sand is dirty, muddy.) While we were waiting for our room to be ready (4pm checkin with kids is horrific) we tried to go to the little outside bar/restaurant, but noone greeted us, asked us if we even wanted anything, we sat ourselves and after a few minutes got up and left. Outside the bar they have this little sad \"pen\" with a little bit of water in it where they keep two sealions. They looked miserable. When we finally checked into our \"Bay Front Suite\" on the first floor on the \"private beach\" I walked in and immediately told my husband, \"I am not staying here!\". Call me a hotel snob, but this room was reminiscent of the cheap hotels my dad used to make us stay in after a long day's drive in our stationwagon on our way from Ohio to Oklahoma to see my grandparents. This room's walls were completely bare, exposed cinderblocks painted white, one small tv sitting on stand on a wall opposite two Full sized beds, both covered in those nasty old quilted bedspreads that are sewn to fit the bed like a slipcover. The room did seem clean, but i would NOT have let my kids sit on that bedspread just for the sheer fact that it was probably 25 years old. I honestly did not even look in the bathroom, i just turned back towards the sliding glass door that led to the little patio, and walked out. Once we made our way back to the lobby to refuse staying here at all, we noticed several cars full of teenage boys, maybe college kids checking in, and it totally dawned on me that this was the equivelant to the beach motel that i stayed in my senior year of high school with girlfriends for spring break in Daytona Beach. NOT the scene for family with small kids. This place should have cost about $69 a night, that is the most i would have paid to stay here (if i was 18 and on my first trip w/o the 'rents). At $189 a night it was a total ripoff!! The girl at the reservation desk didnt bat an eye when we said we werent staying. She checked us out and didnt even say goodbye.

During our stay, I had been looking at the Bahia through a perspective of perhaps coming back with our grandchildren (ages 5 and 7) for a family vacation. The place, on the outset, seems ideally suited for a family vacation, but given the rowdies that we had for neighbors, and the late night noisy crowds on the grounds, I think not. It would be hit or miss with the comfort level. It is also a conference center and set up for large parties and weddings, so you can expect almost anything not conducive with a family vacation.

We arrived at about 3:30 in the afternoon, 1/2 before check-in time. There was a problem with the reservation, which took them 45 minutes to figure out. The entire time, we were listening to the concierge desk staff offer arriving guests their choice of rooms. When our turn came, they did not give us a choice, and did not give us the type of room we had requested (and paid for a month previously) on Orbitz. To their credit, they did give us $25 in food/drink credit. When we arrived at the room, the accommodations were not suitable for habitation. The mold/mildew smell was so strong that I was concerned that I would have allergy problems, let alone my more allergy-prone boyfriend. There was also flood damage and stains on the carpet. I asked for a room change, and we were taken to a room in a more recently renovated area of the hotel. This room was much more acceptable, but there were a lot of little issues, such as the cheap towel racks continually falling off the walls, the shampoo/conditioner not matching, and the suspicious wet cleaner spot about a foot across right in front of the bathroom door. I really didn't want to know what might have been there. Once, when we asked for a change of sheets, the maid came to the room and merely made the bed, rather than change the sheets. We had to call again, and waited quite a while before anything was amended. The fitness center was not in great condition, although the pool and the hot tub were fine.

We had to call the front desk and finally speak to a manager before we got more chips to have with our day old guacamole. The Kitchenette did NOT have a microwave which we though was odd. There is a full Stove w/ oven, but it's not easy to re-heat leftovers as we planned.

They told us about the discounts that were available for Bahia guests to different local attractions (Sea World, San Diego Zoo, etc). They also gave us complimentary tickets for a cruise around Mission Bay that we could use anytime before the end of the year. The room that we stayed in was not your typical hotel room. It stood on its own with no rooms above or below it. There was a parking space right in front of our room which was very convenient. The room was much bigger than what I expected. The bed was comfortable, the wireless internet was great, and there were plenty of towels and pillows! My favorite part of our room was the sliding glass door with the Mission Bay view. At night, we even got to watch the Sea World fireworks that were right across the bay. It was absolutely gorgeous. There were plenty of things to do near the hotel and lots of eating establishments nearby as well. We were able to go kayaking, walk around Balboa Park, shop at Fashion Valley Mall, and eat fresh sea food without doing a lot of driving. The location of the Bahia Resort was excellent! Unfortunately I did not have time to visit the many of the amenities the Bahia has to offer such as the pool, spa, tennis courts, and fitness center but all of the information about these bonuses were available in the pamphlet that was in our room.

My wife had won the stay in a contest and we were truly amazed on how nice it was. We travel worldwide including Europe, Asia, South America, and all over the US. Using TripAdvisor, we were somewhat skeptical with the prior reviews (We had several hotels to choose from the contest). We checked in and the staff was professional and got us our room in short order. We did ask for directions to a local steak house but the person that evening had limited knowledge of restaurants. On our way to the room we noticed that the place seemed completely full on this Holiday weekend. We got to the room and it was gorgeous and spacious. We think they had recently redone the room with tile in the bathrooms, furniture drapes and all. The bathroom was neat and the shower was good (a value point for us!). That night we found the Embers Bar and Grill, just over the freeway, on Mission Bay road and we had a fine inexpensive dinner. Next morning, my wife and I walked in the rain while our daughter slept, to see the birds on the beach just outside of our room. It was very peaceful and picturesque. Sandpipers, gulls, and mud hens were everywhere. We checked out the pool and workout room. The pool was a bit chilly for November but the large spa was very inviting. We got our daughter up, went to a breakfast up the street and then went and spend the day at Sea World. That evening we had our Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel restaurant that had a great staff and very accommodating. After a full Thanksgiving Day of marine animals and walking, we got back to the hotel putting together our Christmas cards on the large nice table in the room.

Before I go further, it should absolutely be noted that the best asset for the facility is the staff working there. Polite, courteous, and helpful are understatements. Granted it was almost 6 months ago we stayed there, I still remember how helpful Patrick at the front desk was for any of our questions (where to eat, where to get surf lessons, etc.), the breakfast server who translated in french for us so we could send a post card out, and the older maintenance man who fixed our many personal things (bike spoke, backpack, and others nothing to do with the hotel). Location - Wonderful. Walking distance to the beach. So many activities within the immediate area. If you have a rental car, that's great but we could make due without one if need be. If you are a walker, this is a perfect spot. Dining - Again, wonderful. Never had a bad meal at the cafe. There are a ton of restaurants to try in the immediate area and around San Diego but the quality made it difficult to really venture out. Bar was great. Only wish was that there was more brands of beer on tap but we could make due. Rooms - Perfect, but again, we had the never renovated rooms.

Loved the fact that there were no bugs so we could leave the sliding door open and have fresh air at night. Pool and hot tub - Fantastic. I believe the water is heated but very clean. Lots of room, even if there are a lot of people there. Love the tiki bar there as well. The Bahia is an outstanding resort as long as you are educated about the place.

Our trip was primarily a family visit, but we were looking forward to enjoying the usual amenities that an establishment with similar prices would offer. Unfortunately, this was not the case at the Bahia. While the room itself was comfortable and provided lots of options for making one's own meals, the grounds are very outdated and need to be completely overhauled. It is virtually impossible to get anywhere without walking through a very crowded parking lot. I understand that the Bahia must do a lot of business, as my first night there I almost did not get a parking spot anywhere remotely close to my building, but they need to figure out something else (anything else, really) to do with the parking situation. I arrived late at night and realized the next day that some other lucky guest had likely checked into (and then immediately out of) my room. My mother, aunt, husband and I had requested adjacent rooms. Somehow my mom and aunt ended up in a king sized bed on the 4th floor, the room next to them had the two doubles they'd requested, and my husband and I ended up in a room that really should become an office - 1st floor, right by the entrance to the building. The room was like a fishbowl; if we kept the drapes open, anyone who wanted a Pepsi or some ice or had to work on the property saw completely into the room (not to mention that the Pepsi machine was actually broken for two days). I had to change in the bathroom area. If we closed the drapes... well, I'd rather not pay over $200 for a cave that could be on I-95 in any state. With a full itinerary of family visits, I ignored the first night's spectacle of one (understandably) very angry man parked directly outside of my room, headlights on, ranting about being screwed out of HIS room (the place was supposedly booked solid). I ignored the constant stream of cars pulling up to my window to drop off their luggage (since the parking spaces were potentially a 10 to 15 minute walk from the building). I ignored the really fun hammock right outside my window that every kid understandably had to scream and run to, then struggle with parents trying to pull them away from it. But once I had a second to breathe, I was pretty ticked off about my room. The Bahia's fix? Take $75 off my bill (which totaled over $800). On top of that, they \"forgot\" to take that pitiful deduction off of my bill, thereby delaying my early-morning rush to catch a plane for another family event. I just returned home today (almost two weeks later) and am hoping that the Bahia's management will make a better decision in terms of customer service now that I have time to deal with the issue. Perhaps the most disappointing thing of all was the pool area. On my last day, after getting nowhere with a reasonable fee adjustment, I figured, \"Hey, enjoy some California sunshine before getting on another plane.\" The tide was rather low and I wanted a swim so I went to the pool. The pool, which is pitifully small for a resort of that size, had a rug around much of it. The rug smelled like you'd expect it to, I suppose; at first, it smelled like sausage, then mildew, then feet, then I went back to my fishbowl, ordered a bottle of wine, and waited to get out of there. My waitresses were extremely gracious and helpful and the seals are really cute. My TV was broken and the repairman came immediately and was very pleasant and efficient. The bed was comfortable. Other than that, I would not recommend this to anyone unless you plan on needing a place to crash and not much more, in which case, save your money and go to a motel.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Fiber-Tech", "ReviewID": "UR19394856", "Content": "This was our 4th trip to San Diego and the Bahia as well.

This is was our second trip to the Bahia in the past year. If you chose the Bahia you wont be disappointed, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a 5 star place. We would stay again. Plenty of activities, and clean fun environment for everyone, the rooms while tired were big and adequate. The pool was great and overall the place was good for the price. Price was competitive and reasonable during the summer months ($225 per night height of summer) given the average San Diego rates for all hotels (1-2-3 star) were $185. The resort is situated on the Bay with great views and access to the beach area and water. The grounds are well kept and groomed. Access to water sports, boating, and sailing are all right on the property and can be rented for a reasonable price. The pool was always at the perfect temperature, and clean. On the weekends they play live music. The front desk staff was always happy to help out and try to make your stay comfortable and address our needs. While it is true the lobby is smallish, it really depends on when you arrive as the amount of crowd you should expect, we arrived and were able to check in at 3:45pm and had no lines or waiting. Free rides on the Riverboat to their sister property is always fun. The kids loved Gracie and the seals on the property. Proximity to all the attractions (SeaWorld, Zoo, Legoland ect) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. Our room was a double bed garden which incidentally is the same size as the Bay View Suite. We had 2 beds, and the couch folded out into a queen-size bed, was perfect for us. The room also had a small kitchen and full sized fridge. This was perfect after a stocking your own food to cut costs. The negatives: It is true that the rooms are outdated for the most part, but we really only spent sleeping ours in the room. I would add that this should not be a distraction, but it should be noted. Our room just happened to be in the tower just near the front entrance and on the 1st floor. This did cause some concern as it is true that the bay side of the resort shares a public road for a public park. The park opens at 7:00am and closes at 9:00pm, so there are parking spaces and access issues if you choose to park out in this area. My advice, you can find parking inside the resort area if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind walking at times, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the beach area on this public side of the resort. Three quarters of beach access is located on the resort property so you should just walk over to the north side where the boats and main beach access is. Gardeners always fired up their leaf blowers at 8am so if you plan to sleep in forget it.

As it turned out, the Bahia was that hotel. After checking out their website and the reviews here on tripadvisor, I developed a pretty good impression of the resort. The pictures are appealing, the location seemed ideal, and the fact that the resort features tennis courts was a nice bonus. Seeing as how there would be five of us on the trip, we decided to book another room through orbitz. Be advised that if you print out directions to the resort from google or mapquest, or what have you, it may still be a bit tricky reaching your destination. The signage in San Diego (and California, in general) leaves much to be desired. Once we finally made it to the resort, we learned that only one of our two rooms was ready. Which wasn't a big deal, considering we arrived before check-in time and could just as easily unload the car into the one room for now. The room, we discovered, was the one provided via the contest, the one with the kitchenette. This was the room in which I stayed. You could tell that there had been some improvements made but, yes, it was still a bit dated. Nothing that would break my trip. But I'd say it definitely had its own charm. My only real complaint about the room would be the layout. The TV was off to the side of the beds, positioned more for viewing from the couch and table. Not what you're accustomed to in a typical hotel room. When we returned from Sea World (which was only a few minute drive) that night, we picked up the key to our bay view room. I had requested that our rooms be close to one another, and they seemed to do their best to accommodate that request. Being that they were different types of rooms, though, they were located in adjacent buildings. This is the room with the cinder block walls. I did not sleep in this room, but the members of our party who did did say that they could clearly hear their neighbor's conversations through the wall. I guess cinder block isn't a good insulator. It didn't seem to be much of an issue, though. And, on the plus side, the patio off of this room did provide a nice view of Sea World's fireworks across the bay. While we did check out the pool one night during out stay, the chilly weather precluded us from actually making use of it. We did, however, take advantage of the tennis courts. Surprisingly, the equipment provided was in pretty good shape, as was the court. It was nice to be able to play at night, under the lights. During our stay, we ate at both the bar and hotel restaurant. No complaints about the food on either occasion. There were a few things we did not have time to take advantage of, including the cruise across the bay and, as previously stated, the pool. Maybe next time. All in all, I thought the grounds were well maintained, the rooms clean (if a bit dated), and the amenities more than you can ask for. I would certainly consider staying here again for the resort itself, and for its location on the bay and near the attractions.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "hobo_ent", "ReviewID": "UR15542855", "Content": "The Bahia is a nice moderately priced resort in a great location on Mission Bay.

I should have taken my friend's advice and stayed at a namebrand hotel (the Hyatt is accross the street - a little more expensive, but at least you know what you're going to get). For the price per room/night you can get a much nicer hotel Downtown. A few suggestions: any of the Hilton's, Marriott's and Hyatt's in San Diego; if you must have the beach, pick the Hyatt, the Catamaran (same family owns this hotel that owns the Bahia so be careful), the Hyatt, or Paradise Point.

The bathroom smelled bad so I left the bathroom fan on most of the time with the door closed. I couldn't take it so I called the front desk to have someone sanitize the bathroom and give it a good clean. Someone finally came late in the evening and he poured something down the drains to kill the odor and 'cleaned' the bathroom. It helped because now all you could smell are all the chemicals. But now I can really differentiate the bathroom smell and the old carpet. The carpet, especially outside the bathroom area, smelled nasty. The bathroom door sticks like it was too big for the opening, so every time someone would open it, it would wake the other person up. The newer furniture do not compensate for the old smelly room. 50 years old I was told. By the way, I reserved a room with a garden view. What a joke!

Putting in a new faucet or sink is not going to make a difference. It's just old and in need of a renovation. I am perplexed by those who rated this place a 4 or 5. Don't let the pictures fool you.

We especially applaud the wonderful and friendly service from the many service people who work at the Bahia such as the groundskeepers, waiters, waitresses, and the housekeeping people!!! Each one, in their own job description capacity, made our stay even more enjoyable. It's location was perfect for visiting local attractions. Be sure and rent a car though, as the motel offers no courtesy vans to the local attractions or to downtown San Diego; however, we saw that different cab companys were available (we were told it was $18 one way to use a cab and that can get expensive if you have a lot of places to visit). The Bahia Resort is quite a huge complex with different types of rooms. If a person reads the word \"resort\" and expects an updated, granite counter tops, luxurious spa-like resort, they will be disappointed. The Bahia is an older motel, with cinder block walls in the two rooms we stayed that were both located on one of two bay sides (outside the doorwalls in our rooms was a public road with public access to that side of the bay's beach but we never heard any road or other noise - on the opposite side of the Bahia complex are rooms that exit directly onto the beach with no public access road to cross). Our two bayside rooms were clean. The bathroom had an older style, one basin sink and just outside the bathroom was an older style refrigerator. The second room we rented had a new refrigerator. The Bahia has a convenient on-site restaurant and separate bar that we thought had very good food and wasn't overpriced. In addition, finding close-by restaurant alternatives was a bit difficult (parking at such off-site restuarants can be challenging because finding parking space in that area is at a premium), so, the on-site restuarant availability was convenient and had better tasting food than a couple of more local, off-site restuarants that we tried. Going to downtown San Diego or into Old Town, provided exceptional restuarant options!!! Mmmm! Those restaurants were amazingly good!!! The Bahia is also the only motel we have ever stayed at where the video arcade room is completely free! There are not a lot of arcade games and the arcade games are bit more geared for the youth but, in our many years of traveling, we have never seen arcade games offered for free before! The grounds of the Bahia are relaxing and well kept, thanks to the attentive service people. The pool area and exercise room are clean and attended to also.

We booked it the day before we arrived so there were very few rooms left and for 5 nights, none of the ocean view were available. My first impression of the front desk was bad (old furniture and carpet, you expect more for a \"Deluxe\" resort\", especially after staying in Delta Chelsea in Toronto and one of the renovated rooms in Excalibur in Las Vegas. The room was bad too: musty smell, terrible bathroom, with floor tiles that were so old that the glaze was gone, rusty bathroom door frame and rotten door. We were given a room facing the tennis court, which was quite roomy, but there are nicer views from the ocean view rooms and the rooms with view on the little courtyard. For $158 a night, plus taxes, I was expecting much better. The staff was just OK, not terribly friendly. Our cleaner kept forgeting putting new toilletrie items, so we ran out of shampoo on a number of times. But the location is great, the pool large with a little kiddie section (2'), a very deep section, and over all a perfect temperature, my kids (5.5 & 3.5) did two Mad Science camps for $3 each for about 45 min, which they loved, the beach was fine, just enough sand and water to keep the little ones happy, we did the Luau party at the Catamaran resort (their sister resort), and for $35 per adult and $15 for my 5 year old (the younger did not pay), we had a nice trip on a sternwheeler to the other resort, a decent polynesian buffet and a great show with warriors and dancers. We also enjoyed the movie at the pool (Narnya, not the latest movie but it was still fun) with free sodas and popcorn (pop corn was out of a bag though and a bit stale, but it was free). Plus the location is great for sea World and downtown San Diego, but you need a car. So overall I rated 3 because the rooms are so old and musty, which I think is unacceptable for a such a resort. Our $70 Comfort Inn in Anaheim was more luxiourious! But the resort is great, and if you travel with kids and want to alternate a day of parks and a day of resting, the resort has plenty to offer. My kids never got enough of the pool and beach, where you can also rent pedal boat and kayaks. We also tried the Bahia Cafe for breakfast and dinner and it was OK.

I booked a Bay View Suite several months in advance. What a disappointment. One of the reasons for booking this location was that it was on the bay and offered rooms with bay views, as in the name of the room. What they fail to mention is that you have to look through two rows of parked cars and then the bay is beyond that. They need to call it a Parking Lot View suite with maybe a small glimpse of the bay. (When looking at the aerial view of the grounds, notice Gleason road. No cars in the picture. They must have photoshopped them out or closed the road down in order to take the picture.) We called to complain and were told that they would see what they could do. They said that some of their rooms were like this. I asked to have one of the ones not like this. They were nice enough to \"upgrade\" us to the Bay View Deluxe suite. The only thing better was that the trees outside of our \"Bay View\" room blocked some of the parked cars that blocked the view of the bay. We decided to stay in this room but we still made it known that we were not happy. Again they said they would see what they would do but we did not hear back and we decided to just deal with it and enjoy our vacation. The view was not the only problem. The room was very dated. The furniture was very old and uncomfortable and the room was sort of musty; nothing cheery about it. The bathroom was tiny. No place to set any of your toiletries on the pedistal sink. We had one bedroom with a queen bed. The sofa in the living area folded out to a bed which is where our kids slept. The better thing about the first room was that there were two queen beds in a separate room from the living area. We wanted a place with a kitchenette....fridge, microwave, etc. so that we could do breakfasts in the room. The kitchen was fine but nothing special. In our upgraded room we did also have a stove but it looked like it was from the 50's or 60's....sort of like the rest of the decor. The hotel itself was fine. The staff was very friendly. We did have dinner at the Bahia Cafe several nights after being too tired to go out after Sea World, the Zoo, etc. It had a good selection for kids (we have 3 year old twins) and they did fine with the meals. They were very friendly to my kids and always gave colors and coloring books. We also ate breakfast in the cafe 2 mornings. The buffet was good and reasonable and it was free for kids 3 and under. The pool was nice. We swam one afternoon after having gone to the beach. They did have a bar and served some foods but they were not there all the time. We asked about it and were told they only served food on the weekends however we swam on Thursday and they were serving food and drinks that day. On Friday we went to Legoland and were planning to come back and swim and just get a quick dinner at the pool but we got back a little late and thought it would be too cold to swim. And, when we got back, they did not have the pool bar/grill open (on Friday night). Glad we didn't set our sights on that too high. We did not swim on the private beach at Bahia. We drove down the street to the beach. That was more fun for the kids with the waves crashing, etc. The beach at Bahia had a slide, swings which my kids enjoyed. We also rode the Bahia Belle (boat) the first night we were there. My kids enjoyed that and it was a nice ride and something easy to do. The seal pond was neat to see but there was only one seal in it. I thought there would have been more but it was for rescued seals which was very nice to learn about. This was another thing my kids enjoyed. Our vacation started us off in bad moods with the disappointment in the hotel but we got over it and had a good time. Some of the other reviews I have read said something about being in recently refurbished rooms. Had we had one of these, maybe things would have been better. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone and would be a little embarrassed to do so. One nice \"surprise\" when we checked out was that they did knock off $100/night on our rate. That made things a little better. We thought it would have been nice for them to let us know about that at the beginning of our week.

Theres also a gazebo they use for weddings i believe, with a really cool looking rainforest type setting around it. Great place to relax. Also, as seen in the photos, the resort is surrounded by a beach on their own private little penninsula. The beach itself is a nice setting, but there ARE better beaches in San Diego. I dont think they have a lifeguard on duty there, at least not while we were there. But if the weather permits, its also a nice place to just relax. We also decided to go the the Bahia Cafe located on-property, and while a little pricey, the food was excellent, and the service was fast and friendly. After eating, and after checking out, we walked by the seal exhibit, and even though other reviews say they have 2 seals, there is currently only on there. It seems that they use this enclosure as a means to rescue seals, and eventually release them back into the ocean, which i thought to be very cool. So, i would definitly recommend the Bahia to anyone reading this.

The idea was that I could leave the beach anytime to go change clothes or get more drinks from the room, or do my own thing while my boyfriend continued surfing. We called the front desk to confirm these features before booking and the staff said the surf beach was right across the street and that yes, all massage services were available at the spa. Calling back a month later to book a massage, having reserved the room, I was informed that there is no spa unless I want to go to their \"sister hotel\" a mile or more away. And it turned out that the ocean beach is actually down the street and around the corner...walkable, but we're glad we had rented a car because it would be an uncomfortable walk with wetsuits, etc. However, the hotel is directly on the water of the bay, with boats parked right there and a beach to sit on and relax. Very picturesque and serene. The hotel came off to me as somewhat of a business person's/family hotel...the one large hot tub is shared with other hotel guests. You must enjoy looking at other people's children, as there are a lot of them, or at least there were when we were there. We were in a room in the main building across the drive from the front desk...the decor/general feeling I thought was a bit on the cheesy, dated side but it is what made it unique, also. It could also be thought of as 'exotic', with kind of a wood/olive green/rainforest type motif or feel. It was all clean and the housekeeper did a great job. The hotel staff is fairly professional. The environment in general makes for a nice getaway, and cool things to do are walkable--the ocean beach, shopping, restaurants. But I would suggest having a car or utilizing the city bus system which is what we did once we had walked our way into \"town\" and needed to get back to the hotel. Sea World is just a convenient few minutes away by car--or, as I overheard another guest saying, a $5 taxi ride each way. Which is the same as the $10 parking fee.

Lots of air traffic too - having the San Diego International airport in the middle of the city is convenient but noisy. Helicoptor tours buzz the bay & beach several times a day. We didn't really use the kitchen since we were only there for 3 days but the fridge was nice to keep water bottles handy. The grounds were nicely manicured & well kept. The restaurant & lounge were nice as well. It was fun watching the little kids splash & play at the shallow end of the pool leaving the deep end for adults to swim. The hotel requires kids under 5 to wear a swim diaper available for free at the adjoining fitness center so kids in the huge hot tub were actually okay too. We rented a convertible & loved cruising the Mission & Pacific beach areas & La Jolla with the top down! Belmont Park & the boardwalk along the beach are just a couple blocks away. It's great for people watching & soaking up the sun & beach scene. All you Nor Cal people who love Santa Cruz will appreciate the same kind of vibe here - just a larger area with more people (my heart still belongs to Santa Cruz). Many beach shops & interesting restaurants along the boardwalk. Joe's Crabshack was great for dinner - loud in a fun, energetic way & a lot of totaly random things on the wall to look at. We had dinner at Croce's in the Gaslamp district - nice area but the beach & boardwalk area is more our speed. I used this site to research many of the hotels on the boardwalk but decided on the Bahia because I wanted a nicer hotel where we could relax rather than a hole in the wall with a view. The hotels on beach in our budget range were just that - a building on the boardwalk. The nicer hotels were just too expensive.

We had read many reviews and were a little leary about the property. I would recommend this property to anyone with kids. When we arrived at the Bahia we thought the grounds were beautiful. The front desk people were very helpful. The room was not ready yet, becuase it was only 12pm, as our flight arrived early in the day. They gave us a pool key and a place to change into our suits and told us to enjoy the pool until the room was ready. The pool, whirlpool and workout areas were nice. Nothing special, but very nice to have. Our son enjoyed the pool & we never had any problems finding a place to sit in the sun. The person that we spoke with while making reservations was very helpful also! I think he actually upgraded our room, because we had requested the lowest price room, which is a garden view (basically two beds and a bathroom) - we were upgraded to a newer Garden View Studio with a kitchenette and living room! It was nice to have our own fridge and stock up on some food/drinks for the week. This room should have cost us about $200 more for the week that we were there! Our room was great. It was facing the front desk area, on the third floor - room 642. It was high enough that we could see the bay & it overlooked the Harbor Seals! We would sit on our deck and watch them swim. This was a treat for our 6 year old son. The room was very clean and did not smell at all. Housekeeping did an excellent job keeping our rooms clean & towels well stocked! The only complaint that we did have was that the patio doors are single pane glass, so they did not keep out the sound very good. We never had any problem sleeping though, as we were pretty much on central time zone & went to bed early & up early every day. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was good. We didn't think it was that expensive, considering the menu items were limited & about the same price as the buffet. We ate the buffet almost every morning. We had the Easter Brunch on Sunday & this was excellent. Alot of food & very well done! The egg hunt for the kids was great, as well as the ride on the boat to the Catamaran (sister hotel). We had dinner only one night at the hotel & their evening menu was also very good. Be aware that this is a family hotel so there will be alot of kids in the dining area. I liked the location of the hotel because it is so close to alot of areas. We did not rent a car because my husband did not feel comfortable driving in San Diego. We didn't have any trouble finding taxis and it was probably less expensive for us to take taxis than renting a car for the week. We taxied to Sea World - $6 each way.... the Zoo - approx. $20 each way....Pacific Beach area (Mission Blvd/Grand Ave/Pacific Beach Drive) was about $5 each way. We found ourselves going to this area alot in the evening as there were many great restaurants on or by the beach! We never felt restricted by not having a car. We found a little market near Pacific Beach to buy our groceries too. This is definitely a great hotel for families. We are not too picky, but do like to have a nice hotel room. Our family loved this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is also a great place if you have teenagers, as it is only two blocks to Belmont Park! I noticed alot of teenagers in groups heading over there in the evenings. I felt that this was a very safe area of town for our family too.

Below are some hints on what to expect and some advice in booking a room. Good Stuff: ************ **The location is the Bahia's greatest attribute, and that is why they can charge what they do. You are very close to Mission Beach and the Pacific. You are still only 10-15 minutes from downtown. **The rooms are ok if you get the right type of room. The best are the studios in the '400' building which are good size and have a kitchen. If you can afford the extra cost to view the bay, this is a plus. Try not to stay on the first floor. **The breakfast buffet is good value. **The pool is beautiful, but if it is crowded ... get there early. See my comment on the obnoxious music below though. **There are 2 tennis courts (with lighting) and the tennis pro is great. **The front desk staff are generally helpful and efficient. **Room service has good food and service. **Enjoy San Diego - it is one of the very best in the USA with so much to do and with a great climate ! **The Bahia Belle is a Steam Wheeler ship that is quite fun to take at night and to dance to the music and have a drink while cruising between Bahia and Catamaran hotels. **The grounds are well maintained. Bad Stuff - Warning ! *********************** **As mentioned in other reviews - most certainly avoid the rooms in the building across from the Lobby !!! In particular on weekends, there is loud music at night from the parties held on the top floor. This has been a problem for many years, that the hotel has not addressed. On some of my early trips here, this kept me up many nights. I do not stay in these rooms any more. **The plumbing and rooms are old and in great need of updating. A high percent of the rooms do have a moldy smell. Also, the A/C and heating can be quite loud at times. **Do not believe the sales pitch (pictures) on the Bahia web site. This is a sales job that makes the hotel appear to be a 4-5 star hotel. It is only a 3 star hotel due to the conditions of its rooms, at best. **For some reason, the hotel continues with music at the pool that really takes away from a quiet experience and a chance to relax. This has been routinely mentioned in other reviews, and it is true. I have sat in a lounge chair many times wishing the music would just go away !!! **Be careful in booking your room rates, as they very often go up on the weekends significantly. The hotel could be so much more, if the owners would invest further in some improvements. The location is great and I continue to stay there happily if I get the right deal and room.

The hotel grounds are immaculate with a gorgeous seal pool at the front. The ground staff we constantly keeping the grounds neat and tidy. The check in was easy with friendly staff and we recieved 4 complementry tickets for the lovely harbour cruise. When we got to our room I was very surprised. They was no smell WHATSOEVER. The bathroom was very clean - mainly white tiled with a powerful shower. The only problem was that the shower was positioned very low, and being 5ft 10 that turned out to be a bit of a nightmare when i tryed to wash my hair every morning. The room, to my surprise also had a small kitchen in the corner which we loved. It meant we didn't have to eat out every lunch and dinner time. There was a big fridge/freezer so we bought drinks and snacks in bulk and kept them for the duration of our stay. The room also had a table and chairs and a comfy settee so it was sorf of self catering (much cheeper). We found it really good when we were just lying round the beach and we just had to nip back to the room for food. The only problem I really had about the room was that we were on the ground floor and facing the car park. Being on the ground meant that we didn't really have a private space outside as anyone could walk on/off it. A balcony would have been nice but we were out and about the majority of the time so it wasn't really that much of an issue. Also by being on the ground floor we had to constantly leave our curtains closed so no-one could see in. They was no nets/blinds so anyone passing would be able to see your posessions. There are parking spaces right around the hotel and we always found it easy to get a space near to our room. At night they lock the back gates at the hotel so its totally private which was re-assuring as our room was near to this area. No-one could walk through that wasn't meant to. The private beach was lovely. We bathed on this a few times and really loved it. Its such a beautiful setting and very clean. It was never very busy either. I think the most people i ever saw on there was about 10. The sun loungers weren't the cleanest so you would need your towels to cover them. Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again (but maybe ask for a room with a balcony and a bit of a view). The decor was slightly oldfashioned and the carpets were a tad shabby but if you can look past this, this is an excellent hotel in a beautiful location.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLooks Like a Well Kept City Housing Project\u201d", "Author": "pradancer", "ReviewID": "UR5726079", "Content": "When we pulled up, my nine year old asked \"is this an apartment building?\" I believe, many years ago, perhaps this was a nice place.

I was able to enjoy my entire weekend without having to drive anywhere. There is a lot of great restaurants within walking distance, and we LOVED Cafe Bahia... so delicious.

I had known that my chances were iffy staying at the Bahia as the reviews are mixed, but I thought I would check it out myself as I am usually not as negatively opinionated as others. This is the 1st time I have left a review of any hotel I have stayed at, let alone wrote the very day arriving home. Let me tell you of my stay. My girlfriend and I had booked this room for her elderly mom and my teenage son. We requested a room that was wheelchair accessible. We called several times to confirm, each time getting a different story as to whether we would be able to get a wheelchair to our room or not. Upon entering bay view suite #196, the room smelled musty. The carpet is worn and looks dirty. The loveseat & sofa has torn upholstery. The sofabed is miserably uncomfortable with a very thin mattress. It was so old & worn that you could feel the bar poking you in the back. We actually rigged it by placing the sofa & loveseat cushions under the mattress so we could sleep on it. I open the patio door at night to let in some fresh air-no screen and ended up letting in bugs. That 1st night we want to order roomservice from the Bahia Cafe but the menu is missing from our hotel book. Call the desk around 8:00 pm and ask for a menu to be brought. Was told by employee it would be brought right over, it wasn't ,so we walked to the desk, got it ourselves, walked back to the room for everyone to see what they wanted & ordered only soup & 2 burgers around 8:45. We were told it would take 35-40 minutes. It arrived in 50 minutes and the food was terrible. But, hey, we had a great day at Sea World and spending some time together, so I'm overlooking those \"little\" things. I noticed that the ugly instituational looking brick walls do come in handy as it appears very quiet-can't hear the neighbors above or to the sides. Sleeping was difficult on the makeshift cushions on the sofabed and also the sheet that they use for the mattress doesn't fit so it kept coming off the mattress the entire night and bunching up. Not fun. Next day notice the mold on the shower cutain, the bathroom vent fan doesn't work, and when making the sofa bed notice some black flecks around the mattress. Things that make you go \"hhhmmmm\".... We spend the day at Balboa Park-have a great time, eat dinner in Old Town-wonderful Italian place. Back at the room we order room service again, thinking that the chocolate weekender & german chocolate cake sounded good. Didn't think it would take an hour to get dessert though, and again, the food is not very good. Tonight I don't get fresh air & let in the bugs, because even though the air conditioner is loud it's not as loud as the swarm of what appears to be underage drinkers & party goers that starts approximately 100 feet outside our ground level room at the PUBLIC beach around 9:30 pm. Unfortunately those previously mentioned soundproof brick walls don't come into play as this party is right behind our room. Called security directly about this around 10:30ish, was told that since it is a public beach, even though they are playing very loud music and disturbing resort patrons, they really can't do anything about it. When told I paid alot of money for this room, security then told me he \"could go out there and ask for them to turn down the music\" but that's all. That's pretty much all I wanted. Around 11:15 my girlfriend calls the front desk and complains again. Front desk says they will call the police. A police cruiser drives by on the public beach street behind my room . The underage drinkers scatter, but the car the loud music is coming from stays along with a few other cars . Minutes after the cruiser leaves, the party & loud thumping start again. It's around midnight I call the police myself. However, I can't find the number as the list of important phone numbers are missing from the resort book. I use my cell phone and get the non emergency SD police phone #. Then, attempt to use the hotel phone, following the directions. The hotel phone doesn't allow me to call the police directly-it states that number is \"unavailable\" from that phone. I have to use my cell phone to call the SD PD directly. KUDOS to the PD. The dispatcher was very helpful & also the officer who re-responded. And not a minute too soon...4 large ticked off men from the room next door were approaching the party-goers just as 3 police cruisers were literally chasing the crowd off. Hope this long review gave you a feel for this resort, specifically room #196. One more thing, upon checkout-the guy beside me was an \"unscheduled\" check out.

My only complaint was that upon entering our room, there was a dresser immediately to the left and it felt a bit cramped going in and out of the bathroom.The pool area was great, although crowded. There was a band of sorts playing caribbean music poolside and drinks could be ordered at the pool along with food such as nachos and hamburgers. Everything could be charged to the room which was great because I didn't have to worry about bringing (and losing) money.

Also, the pool is heated and the jacuzzi is huge. The only bad thing about our room was that the room never really got that cool. But the tempertures we dealt with, it wasn't bad. Also, locals have weddings and graduations there, so that should tell you the place is not bad. Also, the hotel offers a cruise around the bay for free for residents, so take advantage.

Our family of four (children ages 3 and 6) spent five nights there during the busy spring break season at the end of March. We stayed in one of the much maligned (by other reviewers) ground floor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153motel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd style rooms that open out to the beach on Mission Bay. It was pleasant and comfortable, but not fancy. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything wrong with the room or the beds. The weather could have been warmer, but as it turns out, that is not controlled by the Bahia. SERVICE: Overall, the service in all aspects of this hotel, including the restaurant, was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more professional and friendly than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced at the major chain hotels. The only drawbacks to this hotel stem from the fact that it was probably designed and built 40-50 years ago. OUR ROOM: We could watch our kids play on the beach from our room. After the kids went to bed, we enjoyed drinks while taking in the view of the bay from our back porch. Our room was old, but recently redecorated and equipped with a small fridge and microwaive. We did not notice any bad smell. The rooms are several yards from a natural, salt water bay. I suspect reviewers who complained about a smell were overly sensitive to the smell of the ocean during hot weather. We rented kayaks right outside our door and paddled around the placid Mission Bay. Sailboats and other small craft are also available for rent AMENITIES: The grounds of the hotel are beautifully landscaped, including a pool with two rescued harbor seals, which intrigued our children. The swimming pool is also terrific for families \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an bar for grownups, occasional live music, and a large 2-foot deep wading area the little ones. It has a large hot tub, small exercise room, and small video game room. While we were there, the management kindly made all video games free in honor of spring break! RESTAURANT: The caf\u00c3\u00a9-style restaurant had decent food, relatively reasonable prices, and good service. The outdoor seating is especially pleasant, but the weather didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cooperate for us. We ended up starting our days with the breakfast buffet, which was a better alternative to driving to an IHOP or Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and probably just a few dollars more. The coffee was certainly better at the Bahia cafe. LOCATION: The hotel is conveniently located to most tourist activities at the southern end of Mission Beach, although somewhat isolated from other hotels and shopping. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to ocean beaches, the paved ocean walk, and the Belmont Park amusement park. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long walk or a short drive to Seaworld and the eclectic Pacific Beach neighborhood. Try picking up snacks, wine or liquor at Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Garnet Ave in Pacific Beach. If you want to dispense with the rental car, a city bus across the street runs every 15 minutes to the Old Town transit center. From there, you can peruse the shops and restaurants of Old Town, or take the San Diego Trolley (lightrail) to Tijuana, Mexico. The zoo is also a short drive or bus hop. CONCLUSION: This hotel is quite nice but not a fancy hotel, mostly owing to its age and design. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go here looking for luxury on your honeymoon.

The service was mediocre, our meals took a very long time to come out and it was the most expensive meal for our 7 day stay in San Diego. The manager asked how our meal was and when we responded, he just kind of smiled. The smaller Tangier restaurant was fine for a quick bite.

One bad thing I will agree with based on our first stay (but not the 2nd time around) is the musty smell of the room, but we didn't think it was overpowering or that big of a deal. The staff have always been nice and helpful to us. The rooms and furniture are outdated, yes, but again if you want something more lavish and right on the beach in San Diego, you'd likely pay more. But our rooms have alwasy been neat and clean, so it's a good value overall. We don't care to spend much time in our room anyway. Kitchenettes help alot with being able to keep $$$ down so you don't have to eat all of your meals out. The grounds are beautiful as are the hot tub/pool area. Decent fitness center and arcade. Nice private beach with water sport rentals, free evening cruise for hotel guests, restaurant looks good (although we always go out or eat in our room, so can't vouch for the food.)

House keeping is slow to respond. The staff is young, and while seemingly pleasant, are somewhat typical when it comes to service from teenagers. Shady price dealings as well. The Ugly- The Bahia is a complex made up of various types of rooms. We looked at them all and came up with only one that was acceptable. Yes, believe all the reviewers, most of the rooms DO SMELL. The ground floor \"suites\" are akin to staying in a basement - cinder block walls, musty smell and outrageously hideous and abused furniture included. This theme is repeated throughout the complex, though getting slightly less offensive as the room style changes. If they spent an eighth of the money and time they do on the grounds tending to the rooms, the Bahia would benefit greatly. Conclusion- Our room was in the tower directly across from the lobby. We stayed here for the week. No smell. Updated decor. Typical \"hotel\" style. Good view. It is located under the ballroom however and we did experience very loud noise one evening when a private party was underway (we were not notified) and drums from the band shook our room for hours.

We were initially put in one of the \"garden view\" rooms looking out onto Gleason Road public car park. The room was very basic, dark dirty, and the smell of damp was overpowering. For some strange reason there is no light switch by the door so you have to feel your way over to the bed to switch on the light. We asked to get moved and were moved into a room in the tower. This room was only slightly better in that it did not smell as bad. The Bahia is very isolated, you are close to Seaworld, a japanese restaurant, and a run down amusement park. The shops and restaurants on Mission Beach Blvd are 2 miles away. When we asked Front Desk to recommend a restaurent they directed us to Mission Center Shopping Mall which was a 15 min drive away. Our tour brochure described the Bahia as being on a private peninsula. This is not the case, the better of the two beaches is a public beach and there is a large car park down one side of the peninsula serving this beach. The Bahia has a private beach of dulld dirty sand with a large step half down it. The waterfront is not very attractive and there is a large jetty in front of the beach with boats berthed. Front Desk Service assured us that we would be able to get milk for our infant whenever we needed it. When I went down to Front Desk 10 mins before the restaurant opened for breakfast I was told that as the restaurant was closed I would have to drive to Walgreens to get milk. After it was pointed out that deliveries were going into the kitchen and that I could not see how there would not be anyone in the kitchen preparing for opening the assistant agreed to go and see if there was anyone in the kitchen.

There is a nice beach you can walk to on the other side of the hotel that is decent and clean. It's only about a foot deep for as far as I could see, and no waves, which made it nice for our two-year-old. The pool is decent and the jacuzzi looked nice (although we didn't use it).

The room was spacious and clean, but didn't appear to have been updated for a good 20+ years.

We did have two expereiences that are in line with the others here: 1) the maid came the first day around 8AM; a bit early I thought. We had to ask her to come back. 2) Our third and last day, the maid came before check-out time. She cleaned most of the room. We used the room significantly before checkout. Also, we had brought an old pillow we use for travel (quite nasty, I must admit) that the maid must have tucked under the sheets with the other hotel's pillows.

You can walk to Mission Beach (about a 8 minute walk to the sand). While it is crowded with tourists, you can walk down the way to get away from the big crowds pretty easily. There is a cool wave machine at an open air bar/restuarant called the WaveHouse at Mission Beach which is neat to watch. The drinks there are horrible though - don't waste your money. The pool at the Bahia is great - it is large with a 10 feet deep section, as well as a roped off shallow area for kids. There is a large hot tub too. There are science \"camps\" you can sign the kids up for at the pool. There is a small bar there during the day and musicians all over the place playing fun music. There is a small \"seal\" pool you can walk around and view two rescued seals (kids love that). The majority of the grounds are beautiful - especially a walking path that has a very tropical feel to it. Food at the restaurant was reasonable and good. One note: many jelly fish were present at Mission Beach - saw several kids get stung. May just be the time of year, but the lifeguards have vinegar they can spray on the sting to help with the pain.

We upgraded to a studio room that has a kitchenette for only $25 more per night. We checked in a were given a room in the dreaded \"tower\", and what made me more nervous was that it was on the 4th floor, directly under their main convention/party room. These were things that I read horrible reviews on the net about, and I thought my worst fears were about to come true. On our way over to the \"tower\" we noticed the beautiful grounds and pool. The landscaping was so well done, we felt like we were entering an oasis. The whole resort is enclosed by gates and the walls of the hotel. The gates are closed and locked at night, so the only way to enter is by going directly by the lobby. We got up to our room and opened the door, expecting to see mold covered walls and expecting to be knocked over by the smell of mildew, but thankfully nothing like that was to be seen. Our room was very clean, no funky smell, larger than I expected and had a beautiful view of the bay. The king sized bed was firm yet comfortable--no lumps or bows. The kitchen was even fully stocked with dishes, pots, and pans--even a tea kettle! The tower at Sea World was directly across the bay from us, we could see it lit up every night. One night we even got to enjoy fireworks as we sat on the balcony. The room had all the standard amenities-cable TV with HBO and a couple other premium free movie channels, balcony, etc... The bathroom was very clean too, I saw no mildew--and I looked!! The showerhead didn't seem to be too low like others have said. The maid service was excellent, they even washed our dirty dishes every day! My daughter had stuffed some little plastic lizards and other toys in the bed without us knowing and the maids piled them on the table in a nice little pile for her. The heated pool was gorgeous with painted murals and a 32 person hot tub!!! Very family friendly. The garden at the Bahia was beautiful too, definately worth taking a few minutes to stroll through. And don't miss the sea lions next to the restaurant. Pacific beach was within walking distance, with a couple small playgrounds on it. There is a street with a public parking lot between our building and the bay, but it is closed and locked down at night so that no one can enter after 10:00 pm., cutting down on noise. We actually parked there most of the time. Only a couple complaints: *There was a party in the convention room above us on Saturday night (which happened to be the day we chose to rest). The music was very loud with bass thumping, but the front desk did call to warn us that there was going to be an event and to call if there were any problems. It was all over by midnight. *We had booked the hotel and airfare through Travelocity and prepaid the trip. When we checked out, I asked if there was an incidental charge on the room for a phone call we had made (they do charge $0.75 per local call). She said no, there was just the charge for the room and taxes. She showed me the breakdown for 5 nights and that $450 was due. I told here we had prepaid everything throught Travelocity. She punched some buttons on the computer and said \"Oh, okay, you're good to go.\" So, probaby just a small mistake on their part, but it makes me wonder if my card would have been charged if I hadn't took the time to officially check out. So, overall the Bahia made our San Diego trip great! It wouldn't have been the same in a small, generic hotel room on the strip.

In stark contrast to a very slick and inviting website, the Bahia is an ugly, old motor court, unconvincingly spruced up and run on the cheap. Although the wind-sheltered pool and the Latino service staff were delightful, the accommodations were strictly motel and very pricey at that. We stayed in their top of the line Mission Bay Suite, ghastly, and horribly cramped for our family of 5 (double beds only were available). We would have been far, far better off to get two adjoining rooms, if for nothing else than two bathrooms. Our single kept plugging, sigh. And the use of ill fitting mattress covers and too-small flat sheets meant the bed unmade itself as soon as you got into it. We fought sliding sheets all night. If you do decide that the Bahia's pool and 3 block proximity to Mission Beach are for you, DO NOT STAY in the east side of the hotel, on which all the rooms in the low blocks and half the tower rooms face Gleason Road, a public road frequented by local park goers which is also used by the Bahia as a service road for all suppliers. A steady stream of traffic roared by our shabby patio all day (a nightmare if you have small kids), and motor homes parked illegally there all night (shame on the municipality AND the Bahia for not insisting on enforced parking regs there). For less noise stay on the side facing Santa Barbara Cove, and request distance from the tower rooms at the end. The hotel beaches are NOT good for swimming. Because the Bahia is a motor court style hotel, and because all the low rise units have their bedrooms facing the motor court, and all the beds are positioned under the windows, we found the noise began early (with the 5 am squeaky wheeled newspaper cart, sigh) and often ended late with Spring Break partyers returning loudly to their rooms. The fact that the cheap unit doors cannot be shut quietly meant door slamming 24 hours a day. In our opinion, this is not a hotel for you if you have toddlers.

We did not notice any noise from the cars in the street below although on our first night only we heard a few doors slam. The hotel is definiteley much busier at the weekends. We had room service a couple of times and the food was good. The sealion, although not very active was nice to watch, and my son was allowed to feed her once. Her pool was always clean. The staff were pleasant to deal with, and the consierge extremely knowledgeable It is ideally located to many attractions - Seawold just 5 minutes away, 30 mins drive to the Zoo and an hour or so from the Wild Animal Park. Mission beach is a short walk. The pool was lovely and not busy at all during the week and close to our room. On the down side, it is true about the shower heads - they are too low, although I managed perfectly well washing my hair and am 5'8\" tall. A six footer with lots of hair may struggle. The bathroom itself, although spotlessly clean, was in need of a makeover. The fan did not work and my husband had to tighten the screws on the bath tap each night to enable us to adjust the temperature. We found the beds uncomfortable. Despite these small nuisances we had a fantastic holiday and would certainly visit San Diego again.", "Date": "August 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cupertino, CA", "Title": "\u201cStay here only for Location, but pay a lot for it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2462379", "Content": "Like the other reviewers, I was apprehensive in staying at this hotel. And after staying in this hotel, it's not what you call a hotel worthy of the amount you pay for the kind of room you get, but maybe worthy of paying for LOCATION. We stayed in the Cabrillo Suites next to the public parking lot, and every single night we got the chance to see the fireworks from Seaworld. And on most nights we also got the chance to listen to the noise from the parking lot from a sundry of people playing music to driving up and down the parking lot lane with their suped up engines. As for inside the room, the carpets were really dirty! The bathroom also needed a good scrubbing and the tiles in the bathtub were broken with mold growing in the cracks. The bed in our room was a king sized bed with a huge sump in the middle where two people would fall naturally into it. No smell except for lingering cigarette smoke in our room. The sliding glass door latch was broken so it was mandatory to use the bolt on the floor to keep the door close as we were on the ground floor level. If you have little kids, forget about them taking a bath, there's no way to stop up the drain. Housekeeping is spotty, sometimes you get clean glasses, sometimes your garbage sits for an extra day, and sometimes the kitchen is cleaned. This is not a place we'll be staying again in the future. We'll go stay at a Courtyard by Marriott or a Residence Inn.", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Man", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel - Great Pool\u201d", "Author": "Amandamanx", "ReviewID": "UR2459489", "Content": "I stayed at the Bahia Christmas 2003 with my family.

The room was large(studio suite bayside). The kitchen was ok. Stove/oven half normal size, no microwave, full size fridge. The closet really did smell awful. The whole room is outdated. The bay is a great place for early risers to collect seashells. The so called private beach is only 1/4 of the resort. The rest is public beach. That is where our room was. I was shocked by how many R.V.'s were parked and camping tents and all an the bahia parking lot. They even blocked the view for some of the guests. You do have the ocean 2-3 blocks away. and the Bahia Belle boat was fun. Not worth the cost not even close. You are paying for location. We were able to see the seaworld fireworks everynight from our suite. Stay there for great location. Don't have ANY expectations of a nice hotel. It just needs a lot of work.

This summer we took our two kids for a few days. The kids loved it - great pool, playground on the beach, lots of boats and birds to look at, etc. Easy walk to Belmont amusement park.

We all enjoyed that. Hubby and I were majorly disappointed with our suite. It was in need of a major renovation - bathroom was \"icky\", permanent wet spot on the carpet from a toilet leak, smelled of mildew throughout, no screen on patio door so I couldn't keep it open at night (hello - heard of West Nile virus?), furnishings and beds needed to be replaced, poor lighting, overall dorm room decor.

One of the kids got sick and housekeeping came right away to help with mess. I now see why so many of the reviews speak to room location on the property-we were in top floor -rooms 191 and 193 which is on the Mission Bay side and view is boring and acess to beach inconvient. BUT rooms on the Santa Barbara Cove side, called private beach, have tons of ambiance-walk right out of room to grass and clean beach and interesting view.

The weekday rate during summertime is $400 per night plus. This puts the room cost up with some of the best hotels in the world. While the location is very nice, and the grounds are decent, the room (suite, ha) is a grade below a typical motel 6. This is not a criticism of Motel 6, it is a criticism of the ridiculous rate for the room, and service you receive in return. The rooms are dark, the carpet is the quality of indoor outdoor carpet, the bed is your typical cheap hard bed, the sheets are course and they do not even bother with a fitted sheet on the bottom. The bathroom is not connected to the bedroom directly so you cannot access it without going into the main area. . The room is dated but fairly clean. A two night stay, after the roll away cost ($20 per night) and tax, was roughly $1000 dollars. While that would be fine for a top quality resort, it was far from appropriate for this place The last room I stayed in that compared to this one had shag carpet, a vibrating bed, and ran $29.00 a night. Actually it was probably a bit nicer than the Bahia. Boy do I feel stupid :) Room service is very slow and the coffee on our visit was cold. Not a big deal but worth the mention. Overall the location is great, but do not expect a suite that reflects the price in any way. If you can get a beachfront suite for $99 a night then it would be okay (only due to the location). At four times that amount is outright theft. Hope that helps someone.

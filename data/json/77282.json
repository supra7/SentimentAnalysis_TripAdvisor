Location: In the Hollywood area, about 10 minutes (drive) from the Kodak Theatre, 15 minutes from the Griffiths Observatory and Universal Studios. We had a car so found it easy to get around, there are buses nearby, but cannkt comment on good / easy they are to use. The hotel is next to two hospitals so you can get ambulance noise, but it's not too bad. There are a couple of fast-food joints nearby which are walkable. Room: A decent size, with enough space for us and two suitcases. There is also a small fridge and a coffee maker. The bathroom is also a decent size. Note, there was no lift so we had to take our suitcases up the stairs... please bear this in mind when booking this motel. Cleanliness: Room and bathroom was nice and clean. The corridor / walkways are outdoor are a bit worn but fine, and still clean. Breakfast: There is a basic breakfast of fruits and cereal available at reception. Hot drinks available too. Internet: Free wireless is available... the connection is reliable and speedy.

We visited Vegas, and then drove from there to Los Angeles, California, and spent 4 days here. After rigorous researching as always for hotel rooms, we decided to go with this one. The price is extremely descent and the location is Great! with this being said, the rooms are average, I am not a complainer, I am very flexible, but I do have these 4 points that bothered me: 1- THE NOISE!!! i have never slept in a more noisy hotel room before!!!! noises woke me up every single day!!!! there was people up super early in the morning hammering stuff, like working on construction or something! it was horrible! when it wasn't the noise of this, it was some other super loud noise, I don't know what's up with this place, but there had to be some loud noise waking us up super early in the morning every day and that did really set me off!! I have stayed at hotels right next to airports before and not even there the noise has been this horrible!!! 2- THE TUB CLOGGED: Ok, so we came back from sunset strip and decided to swing by the hotel room and change outfits and freshen up for a bit, I wanted to take a shower, and after a minute of two of being in the shower i noticed that the water was not draining away, the drain was clogged or something for some weird reason cause the day before we showered with no problem, but for some reason, the second day the tub clogged and it was disgusting to be standing in the tub trying to shower with all this dirty disgusting water stuck not draining out! UGH! i was sooo annoyed!!! the next morning we mentioned the incident to the guy in the reception, and they fixed it immediately! Kudos for that!! 3- THE \"FREE PARKING\"....Yes, it does have free parking, but their parking space is tiny!! and so it gets full soon and easily, and if that's the case your screwed! you gotta go around the block and try and find where to park next to some houses! it was a huge pain in the neck for us, as we went partying every night, and every night when we came back to the hotel at about 2 am or so, all the parking spaces were full, so we had to go around the block, cold, tired, and me still tipsy (he drove) and try to find parking. This same process happened EVERY DAY! pretty annoying and inconvenient! 4- SCARE OUTLETS: I have never stayed at a place with so little outlets!! are you kidding me!! we had to pretty much disconnect everything in that room to be able to free the outlets to connect all our crap! we almost had to even unplug the tv to be able to plug our laptop! it was pretty ridiculous, not a major situation, but if you are like us, who travel with lop top, and two digital cameras which batteries need to be recharged, and cellphones which need to be charge and blow drier and hair straightener, then you are in little of a pickle like us! I rather not write bad reviews if i can help it, but I had to mention these things!...now, with all the bad things already mentioned, the place was very clean, they have a super comfortable bed I think california king cause the thing was HUGE!, We inspected for bedbugs and found none, the whole time we were there we didn't find any trace of them, and it's been already 2 weeks since we came back home and apparently we didn't bring any unwanted visitors with us, so I think it is safe to say the place is free of bedbugs, or well, at least the room we stayed at. They also offer: Free breakfast, Free Internet, Excellent location and Excellent room service! I AM DEF. STAYING HERE AGAIN IF I EVER GO BACK TO L.A.

We knew going into it that it would be a no frills motel that would serve as a place to sleep after long days of sight-seeing and a place for a nice hot shower. It is definitely nothing fancy and what we termed \"bare bones\" - a term that my 7 year old learned on the trip. But it was fine for us and our needs. We wanted to spend our money elsewhere. The location was good - it was a 1/2 block from a Metro stop so that was a plus. And it was an easy drive to Griffith Park - which is literally down the street and up the hill. We were not bothered by the sounds from the hospital across the street. The area isn't the greatest and I wouldn't have walked around at night, but further down the road toward the park you could tell the area was getting a little nicer and had trendier restaurants. The continental breakfast was nothing fancy, but it offered two kinds of cereal, fresh fruit, toast, prepackaged muffins, coffee and juice. What impressed me was that there was a worker who's one and only job was refilling the breakfast items. My experience has been that everything is put out early and if you arrive later in the morning chances are you won't get anything. This wasn't the case, as the worker constantly restocked everything, even right up until the very end. We also enjoyed the free internet service available in the lobby. Granted only 10 minutes were free, but that's all we needed to check directions or print out tickets. We did have to pay $1.00 per print out, which I thought was a bit much. As for cons, our beds didn't have blankets on them when we arrived, even though it was after the check-in time and about 5:00 p.m. Housecleaning did come by with fresh blankets before I had a chance to call the desk, though, so that was nice. Otherwise the showers were hot, we enjoyed the fridge and the microwave available to us. The parking lot did get crowded at night, but that comes with staying over the weekend. One disappointment was that the pool was empty. It had been advertised I thought as a heated pool and we had been hoping to use it. But we got a great price on the room, had a free breakfast and it was in a good location so we couldn't complain.

The room was fine, a little small, but fine TV, reasonable bed, bathroom and shower fine. Also had fridge. safe and microwave. Breakfast also absolutely fine, ie what I'd expect for the price, fruit, cereals, toast, coffee, pastries, served for a decent length of time. Service also fine, when we arrived we were offered advice on where to go etc, plus when we complained about noisy people outside our room late one night, the night clerk promptly came up and asked them to keep it down, so all fine. The main issues were to do with the location, and the general sorts of problems you get with hotels of this design. We're always struck by how quickly American streets can go from nice to dodgy in a very small distance and this neighbour hood is no different. Hotel premises, fine and well lit, but as soon as you walk out you've got homeless people all over the place, Thai \"massage\" etc, but then also other nice hotels and reasonable premises too. It's not really Travelodge's fault, but we weren't often keen on going for a stroll around in the evening. That said, there are a number of places to eat nearby, mostly junk though. The second problem is to do with the motel style design of the hotel, ie all of the room's doors opening to a central, open area. It meant that the noise of sirens from the nearby hospital, general car noise, and the noise of some inconsiderate fellow guests often disturbed us, especially in the evenings. None of this would have been so bad if not for the two-inch gap under our door! Even after trying to block it with coats, noise and often, smoke, from outside would come in, and this wasn't terribly pleasant. Again, not 100% the hotel's fault, but not something you'd get with interior corridors and a better door. I don't know if all of the doors had this gap. That said, I'd still recommend the place as it was economical, in a very useful location for getting to things by car or Metro, and the breakfasts were fine.

It offers a very basic motel room, but is one of the few places this far east that is a \"normal\" motel. It certainly has its flaws--arrive back past 11pm and you'll have to park wherever you can find on their undersized lot--usually including no parking zones. No elevator and few stairways mean that lugging bags upstairs is a necessary chore. They also cut off breakfast way too early on weekends. But the breakfast is free and relatively nutritious (i.e., not just a prepackaged sugary danish as in similar motels). Coffee is horrible--next time I'll bring my own. I'm from LA, so I don't find the neighborhood as sketchy as some others do. It is down the block from some large hospital complexes, so not particularly isolated. It is also within an easy walk of great LA restaurant/lounges like the Dresden (see the movie \"Swingers\" if you don't know it.) So you can stay out late without worrying about driving--a rare LA treat. Between Vermont Ave. and downtown LA is a no-man's land for clean, safe, economical lodging, so this place is great if you want to be near Hollywood, downtown, Silver Lake. Los Feliz or the other nearby areas but don't want to pay downtown or central Hollywood prices. There is a charm-free pool in the middle of the parking lot but I've never used it.

Griffith Observatory is walking distance but a bit of a hike! The view of the Los Angeles basin from the top and the Hollywood sign makes it more than worth the effort.

This is the only place that refused a cash deposit. The room was what we expected. We stayed three nights and were given two very small bars of soap for three of us! And the cleaners removed the soap we had brought with us, without providing any more! So definitely could do with providing a bit more soap, especially if the old soap is removed! Our bath/shower drain was completely blocked, so dont want to think about what our feet were sitting in when showering. Toilet seat was broken. And we arrived to a blocked toilet, which I heard others complaining about also, but which was fixed within 5 minutes of us reporting it and did not block again. Oh and we were downstairs, can hear everything going on above us - TV, walking around etc The staff tried very hard to push a particular LA tour on us. We decided not to use it, and instead asked about public transport and they would not tell us anything. Extremely unhelpful in that area. The metro station is just up the road but they wouldn't tell us anything about it. Getting to the beaches is difficult. We tried the buses, took a VERY long time, public transport is not great in LA.

There's a small free breakfast and coffee-making facilities in the room (no decaf) But it's the situation which mostly recommends it for a visit to LA without a car (though at reception they will probably tell you that you need a car to get around but that is LA). I always stay in this area because, although it dosen't look anything very special, there is a nice row of shops, caf\u00c3\u00a9s and restaurants higher up the street north of both Sunset and Hollywood Blvds(in Los Feliz village). There is a supermarket and a couple of fast food places between Sunset and Hollywood Bloulevards. So there's something to come back to in the evenings. For getting around buy a day pass from the ticket machines in the Red Line Metro station which is a couple of hundred yards away and use it for both buses and metro. The Rapid buses (numbers 700 and above) only stop at the main places and are as fast as using a car. You can easily visit: Universal Studios and UniversalCity (Red Line direct to Universal City) ;Hollywood (Red Line direct to Hollywood/Highland or Hollywood/Vine); downtown (Red Line to any of the stations - lunch time is best when the streets are full of workers on their break); Long Beach (Red Line to 7th/Metro Center) then Blue Line; Santa Monica (Bus 704 from Vermont/Santa Monica which is five minutes walk down Vermont from the hotel); Beverly Hills smart shoping, Westwood Village and UCLA (Red Line to Vermont/Wilshire) then bus 720 to the appropriate stop. From Westwood you can catch the 761 to the Getty Center; Glendale (for the Galleria and the amazing Americana Brand shopping centres) is 15 minutes away on the 180, 181 or 780 from Vermont/Hollywood Blvd. The same buses (the 780 is much faster) continue to Pasadena and stop at the Simon Norton Museum as well as the plesant downtown. You can even get to the hotel from the airport, even without a day pass or a TAP card. Catch the free airport G Line shuttle to Aviation station on the Green Line and buy a $1.50 single ride ticket to Vermont Avenue Station (three stops). Go out of the exit at the front of the train and catch the rapid 754 bus north on Vermont (frequent until mid-eveing, after which you'll have to use the slower 204). You'll need the exact $1.50 fare. Stay on it until the last stop (it takes 50 minutes to an hour) and you'll see the Travelodge on the left, just before the bus turns the corner from Vermont onto Sunset. It's a hundred yards or so to walk back. Much cheaper than an airport shuttle bus or taxi.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cGANG TERRITORY-NOT REALLY 'HOLLYWOOD'\u201d", "Author": "egnoir", "ReviewID": "UR85812779", "Content": "Whoever writes positive reviews must work for the hotel...

The place comes across as old, kind of run down but for under $100 for a night, what can you expect? There was just a shower stall in the bathroom which \"looked\" clean - reminded me of a swim-club shower actually. When we first arrived I was taken back by the sign posted on the building stating something to the effect that the state of CA has them inform you that the building is made of materials that may be hazardous to your health and can cause birth defects. I've never seen that posted on a building before - maybe it's just a CA law (who knows how many buildings have asbestos or other things elsewhere??). I just found it unnerving. There was a run-down restaurant (closed??) next door with lots and lots of flies buzzing around. We didn't have time for the pool so I can't comment on it but from a distance it looked clean. Breakfast was \"grab and go\" which is fine - Otis Spunkmeyer (sp?) muffins and danish and coffee and juice. The coffee only had powder creamer (I'll admit, I'm picky and like a liquid creamer) but again, for under $100 I really have no right to complain.

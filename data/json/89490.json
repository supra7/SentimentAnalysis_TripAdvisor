This was a suite and was very large. I had stayed there about 5 years ago, and was surprised with how everything has been allowed to become run down. I think the web site stated that the hotel had been renovated. Well, not the room we were in! The first thing that greets you was a large mashed-in vent in the hallway. Our bedroom had decent carpet in it--the beds were okay, but the pillows were terrible. On our balcony (the one off the bedroom), the screen was half torn off and never could have been used in case you wanted to leave the door open. The sofa bed in the bedroom was the most uncomfortable thing I ever sat on. When we first arrived, the room was blazing hot and we could not get the thermostat to work--called the front desk, was told that \"maintenance would come check it out\". They never showed up, but, on our own, we got it working. Since we had a suite, we also had our own private (and very large) porch that you could enter thru the atrium/living room. However, it appeared to be locked, and we could not get it opened. This also was reported to the front desk, and I saw the clerk write the request on a piece of paper for maintenance. Once, again, no one showed up, so this could never be used. The two sofas in the atrium were dirty and frayed on the edges. Just like other people have written, the indoor pool is not heated--in fact, it was very cold and also was not very clean. Didn't really have any problems with the clerks at the front desk. With the Quality Inn being a national chain, I expected more with this visit. Hotel rooms are not cheap, and I was dissapointed with my visit. I didn't pay for a worn out room.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morgantown, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel.

We booked 2 oceanfront rooms. The rooms were on the 8th and 4th floors. We had one king room and one double room. We had an awesome view of the ocean and the balconies were private. The rooms were very clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable and everything in the rooms was working properly. I'm not sure why so many people complain about the parking garage only going to the 4th floor because you can access the elevators from every floor. I felt it worked out just fine. At least you don't have to park 2 blocks away. Although this hotel is in desperate need of an update, it was clean and I would take clean over fancy any day.

The room was large enough for us during our stay and had a private balcony. There are no safes in the room but rather at the front desk. Upon check in, we were never greeted warmly by the clerk. I would at least expect a \"Welcome to the Quality Inn, blah, blah, blah.\" I believe all I got was a \"Hello, how can I help you?\" First impressions are everything in my opinion. While the mattresses were comfortable to me, the pillows were absolutely horrible. No support whatsoever. Your head just sank right down in the middle and given that we didn't sleep well on them. The room was clean enough for us. We had an issue with the a/c not cooling the room but maintenance came right up and tripped the circuit breaker and all was well after that until check out morning and the same problem occurred. My main concerns with the hotel is that the indoor pool does NOT get cleaned out on a daily basis and it is NOT heated. For 4 days straight, sand sat in the corners of the pool and just accumulated each day. I noticed on the day we checked out that it was finally vacuumed. The water also looked very murky each day. We complained to the front desk that the pool was not heated, even though the hotel claims it is and the temp was 80 degrees. We chose, instead, to use the outdoor pool. The other issue I have with this hotel is that the parking garage only goes to the 4th floor. The hotel has 8 floors. We always parked on the first or second level so that it made it easier to haul our gear to the beach each day. Our stay was better than most of the reviews you may read here.

Our room (a suite) was not ready until 3:50pm (also other angry customers waiting to check in), making us wait around the entire day while getting charged for it! During the check-in, it seemed as if they cared MORE about the customers getting the regular rooms than the customers who are paying more for suites. The suites are TINY. I wouldn't even call them a suite. The towels were DISGUSTING. Most of them had stains on them which grossed me out to even touch. Housekeeping was friendly. They have 3 poors, two outdoors one indoors. The HUGE outdoor pool wasn't even filled and the other outdoor pool on the 4th floor was TINY; didn't even bother to go into the indoor pool. The kitchen in the suite was terrible; small oven, small sink (could hardly do dishes). Air conditioners were loud. They don't even give full sized pillows on the bed.

The chlorination equipment at the outside pool malfunctioned (exploded) and we were evacuated for 2 hours. That could have been an accident but you have to wonder if it was taken care of as it seems as nothing else in the hotel has been. The inside pool was disgusting and had a film on the water. The staff at the front desk were very inattentive and not very friendly. They acted like interrupting them from their personal conversations was a problem. The maid service was excellent. The maintenance men were excellent. I can only imagine the calls they get about having to fix things. This hotel is not worth the price at all. At that cost, things could be upgraded and renovated.

It is a efficiencycenicy unit that would be fine but this looked like they had had it forever. The burners didn't sit flat, and the drip pans were gross. The oven interior was dirty. The sliding glass door inside trim was about to fall off. Didn't hit the indoor pool but it looked pretty nice. The exercise room was REALLY lacking.

On the plus side, the price was fair, the location was good (end of the boardwalk), and there was a large, inviting indoor pool and hot tub. The room was very large and seemed even larger because the ceilings were extremely high (I'm guessing 15 feet in our room). It had a king sized bed that seemed overly soft, but I must admit I slept very well. The TV was a current wide screen LCD with an adequate number of stations. There was a good sized fridge with icemaker and microwave and even a skinny oven in the room, although we only used the freezer to chill a bottle of wine we bought. There was a good sized balcony where we could see the ocean, although it was too cold to go out there. On the negative side, the room was in need of a general makeover. The green carpet was stained and a few years past its expiration date - there was a slight funny smell in the room, undoubtedly caused by the carpet. The shower drain was clogged and the showerhead needed replacing badly. The worst part is that as we opened the door to our non-smoking room, there was always an odd rush of cigarette smoke that dissipated after we walked in, so I'm not sure where it was coming from. There were some fairly noisy things going in the room (various motors and fans, but I'm not sure) which woke my wife up at times. In terms of amenities, there was a fitness room that had some old cardio pieces, three of the four seemed to work but it was inadequate even for a hotel fitness room. There was a restaurant that served breakfast (not included with room), but we didn't try it as it didn't look too inviting. As I mentioned, the pool looked great, and it was constantly crowded. There was a game room that had some pinball and arcade games that looked to be in the neighborhood of 20+ years old. There was free wi-fi, although in our room, it wasn't really faster than 3G on my phone. I would recommend this hotel to others, with the caveat that there are better choices.

I was promised wireless internet (like stated on their very own webpage), we arrive and are placed in a room OUTSIDE.. yes it was december/january. NOT in the hotel itself. Not that big of a deal, just a little chilly to walk in the OUTSIDE hallways. That was my first issue. Second, the wireless. I immediately tried connecting, no server available. I called to the front desk, they informed me their wireless has been down and it may not work, but it may not work because of how far AWAY our room was from the wireless router in the INSIDE of the hotel. The lady suggested we decide RIGHT now if we want to switch rooms to attempt to get wireless, or deal and basically hung up on me. Ok, so we went to the front office to check to see if the wifi worked there, indeed it did but was VERY slow, couldn't even load up the internet. So, we did not switch rooms afterall. So, we are checking out our room after this wifi nonsense, cracks all over the walls, high ceilings with spiderwebs and dust HANGING down from it. The kitchenette area was very old, made me feel dirty looking at it. Note, I am a 23 year old who LIVED in college dormitories and houses with people, I am not the pickiest, so if you have children, I would suggest away from this place. The bathroom, gross. the shower floor was BLACK/BROWN, no mat down. FOUL! The light fixture had dust hanging down from it. The only plus to this place was the balcony, which was a wrap around since we were on the corner/outside of the building.

The room had a sleeping area w/TV and a separate living/dining area with TV. As most reviewers have noted, the hotel is dated in it's decor. The rugs in the halls were stained/dirty.

There is a VERY small loading area in front of the lobby and if there is another car in front of you parked in just a way that you can't get around it, then you must wait until that person moves their car. Luckily, by the time we dropped our bags off in our room, the car in front of us had moved and we were able to park our car in the garage. The indoor pool is not heated as the hotel claims. For the 5 days we stayed here, not once was the indoor pool or the jacuzzi vacuumed out. The same sand sat at the bottom of both pool and spa for our duration. Also, the indoor pool's water was so very cloudy during our stay that I have to wonder if it was just too much chlorine or the lack of it being cleaned daily. The outdoor shower/faucet to rinse your feet off after leaving the beach had broken handles so the water could only trickle at ALL times and wasn't effective at rinsing sand off your feet. We ended up using the bathrooms in the indoor pool area because those showers had much better water pressure. We also had an issue with our shower drain not draining. We called maintenance twice, can only assume they came while we were out, but the shower water continued to pool at our feet during our showers. Overall, just an okay stay.

Here, it is a seperate door you have to go through, in order to get to the rooms that face the ocean. Gee, thanks for NOT marking that door so people like my wife and I would know. The room was clean. But the wallpaper had that light pastels abstract art design to it, that seemed to have been more popular in the 1980s. It reminded me of Miami Vice, and was expecting Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas to come barging into the room. I loved that our room had a balcony and faced the ocean, and had a kitchen. But, we as avid coffee drinkers were not happy to discover that our coffee maker did not work, and we wasted some good Starbucks ground coffee, when it did not filter, and we had a mess to clean up. Luckily, the Hilton next door sold Starbucks coffee, which took care of that problem. They did replace the coffee maker, though. We cooked breakfast the next morning, which was nice. There is a small grocery store called Anthony's, practically in front of the hotel, on the main road there. But for the stove, one of the four coil burners was not working. The one other concern I had was the door to the room. At the very bottom corner, there was a chunk missing, and you could see sunlight coming through it. This is a door that leads to the outside, and not an indoor hallway. If this was winter time, cold air would have been seeping in.

We had to hunt staff down for our little bottles of shampoo and even for towels one day! You walk away with the sense that staff really don't care at all, hate their jobs, and feel secure in not doing their jobs. This is no way to run a service business. And, to top it off, housecleaning stole doughnuts out of our fridge..... does that not speak volumes of the morale of hotel staff when they take to raiding our fridge and eating our doughnuts?

At the time, it was one of the few upscale hotels in OC, offering amenities not available at many others - like an indoor, heated pool and rooms with 1.5 bathrooms. Through the years, we saw the same staff at the front desk and they were all friendly, kind and helpful - and the service was personalized. The years have passed and they are still one of the nicer properties, but with the addition of a number of new hotels that were built on the sites of older hotels (that were torn down) - such as the Hilton Suites - that is where the Stardust was next door - Courtyard by Marriott (where the Santa Maria once was), the Holiday Inn & Suites, etc., they fall more into the category of upper level moderate or low level upscale. Overall, the Oceanfront rooms are very spacious, which is unusual in Ocean City. Other nice features in our room that you don't often find in OC were a full refrigerator and a stove/oven, as well as a microwave. The mattress was nice and firm and we loved the 2 person jaccuzi. The room was maintained in fairly good condition except for the woodwork at the bottom of the door, which was damaged and had a small opening to the outside (which was actually outside, due to the unusual location of our room). Our only real disappointment was that the service from the person who we first encountered at the front desk was one of those briskly officious types that are strictly by the book and not a square inch more. You all know the type - you can spot them by the look on their face. Since we were staying over the Memorial Day weekend and traffic from our area to the beach can be wicked, we'd left extremely early and had breakfast in Ocean City. Parking at the pay by hour lots were all full, so we had no choice but to see if we could register early to get a parking pass, planning to then go out on the beach until our room was ready. In the past, the great front desk people would take your cell phone number and call you when your room was available. We typically arrive early and the hotel wherever we've stayed would register us and then it would simply be a matter of giving us the room keys whenever the room was ready. During this process, they'd check to see if maybe the room WAS ready. Usually it wouldn't be, but most hotels will offer to take your cell phone # and will call you IF it's ready before check in time. Not this time. We were advised check-in is at 4:00 and there was no effort made to see if the room was ready. To her credit, she very efficiently and professionally issued us a parking pass and very accommodatingly provided us with a day pass that allowed us access to the indoor pool and the bathrooms located in that area. In fairness, it was Memorial Day weekend and they were most likely busy and it probably takes time to take the next step to calling the guest assigned to each room as the housekeepers relay the information on the rooms they finish. We left, went to lunch and returned to the hotel. On our way through to the beach, I noticed she wasn't at the front desk, so I stopped and asked another employee if he could check to see if by chance our room might be ready. He said he'd be happy to and we were delighted to learn it was, so we were able to check in and go to our room, change and go to the beach. I am very appreciative of professionalism and efficiently, but attitude is everything to me. I was fully prepared for our room not to be ready when we arrived, but I could tell the first gal I encountered was going to hold to the 4:00 check-in time even if every room in the hotel was ready - just because that's the policy. While this is such a small aspect of the overall stay, how you're treated at the front desk sets the tone for your whole stay. However, she was only one of several people working the front desk during our stay and the others were lovely. There's always one, isn't there? However, another experience with a different front desk person more than made up for any petty disappointment I had. On the second day of our stay, we had a death in the family and had to make an early departure. We were totally prepared to be charged for all 3 nights, even though we'd stayed only 1.5 days. As we checked out, my husband told the gentleman at the front desk that we had a family emergency and were checking out. He very kindly offered his sympathy and regret we had to cut short our visit and apologized that he had to charge us for two nights - as that was the minimum stay - but didn't charge us for the third night. We were totally surprised by this act of kindness, which will earn them our future business and recommendation of their hotel to all our friends and family. This was a classy act and we were touched and grateful for the courtesy extended to us at a difficult time. I wish I'd gotten his name, as he was extremely kind. In between our check in and departure, we had an embarassing moment. We returned from breakfast the second morning to hear the fire alarm sounding in our room. I quickly called the front desk to see if we needed to evacuate (we hadn't seen or smelled any smoke - and hotels will often have fire alarms go off) and were told they didn't see anything on their console, but she could hear it on the phone and they'd send someone right up. No kidding, but someone was there in less than 5 minutes. He walked right in, over to the clock radio - and turned off the alarm. We hadn't set the alarm, but apparently the prior guests had. Holy moly, but it was LOUD - and the very, very nice maintenance/engineer said it happens all the time. How humiliating, but what great service. Overall, I feel the hotel is a good value. You get a lot of nice amenities for a very reasonable price. The hotel may not have the very latest in decor, but it's been nicely maintained. It's also a few blocks up above the end of the boardwalk, so the location is quiet and we heard no noise from rooms on either side. Ideal for a family - nice for a couple.

Last year we stayed at the Holiday Inn which was fabulous, but we were looking for a little less pricey alternative. Pros: Location - Amusement park only a couple of blocks away. There is a little deli on the same block that the kids could get to quickly. Also a McDonalds and Burger King just across the street. Two blocks to Higgins Crab House and only a couple of blocks to walk to tram that will take you down to the heart of the boardwalk. (Note - the kids missed being right on the boardwalk but this was a great alternative that they ended up quite happy with.) People - For as many issues that we had, the staff was quick to take care of each and every one and did so with a smile. One night desk employee didn't seem to know much about anything at all, but he sure was nice telling us how sorry he was. Parking - Ample parking in the 3 or 4 level garage. On site restaurant - Only open for breakfast. The omlettes were beautiful and service was great. Indoor Pool - Very roomy and clean. 3 separate showers to rinse off sand before entering the pool. Very nice hot tub, though often filled with children and a couple of the jets were borderline painful. Cons: Cleanliness - I really think this is one of the dirtiest hotels I've ever stayed in. The common areas were beautiful and very clean, but my room left a LOT to be desired. I couldn't even use the dish towels provided because of the dirt sticking to it from the drawer. The small in room coffee pot had mold growing around the top - stick to the free coffee provided in the lobby each morning. Age - The room just seemed run down. The sink was rotting out of the counter. The burners on the stove would not sit down flat. There isn't a SINGLE additional towel rack in the room. (They encourage reuse of towels but don't provide a place to hang them to dry. Odd.) Exposed carpet tacks brought blood to the heels of 3 of the 5 of us. These were fixed immediately. The hair dryer was literally cracked down the middle and threw sparks every 20 seconds or so. This, too, was replaced immediately. Room layout - Every suite I've ever stayed in has had two TVs. This is the first that had only one. The beds and the foldout couch are in one large living area. There is a strange accordian door that separated the fold out couch from the beds, but without a dedicated TV, I'm not really sure what the use of that might be. (Oh - and despite checking in with 5 people, there were no sheets, blankets or extra pillows for the fold out couch. That was ANOTHER call to the front desk.) Outdoor Pool - The outdoor pool is ocean view and on the 4th floor. There is an odd stone wall that sits in the middle of the deck that doesn't really appear to have a purpose. I'm sure it does - it's just very weird and blocks some of the view. There was only ONE table with a sun umbrella and the pool restroom was out of order. The manager, Matthew, was very apologetic about my experience here and handled my issues appropriately.

Black hideous 1980's wallpaper everywhere, cruddy corroded faucets in bathrrom and especially the kitchen. The whirlpool jets in the tub were disgusting. The furniture was sticky to touch, and the room was supposed to be non smoking and it reaked with smoke.

EXPERIENCED WITH THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "VacationReviewer999", "ReviewID": "UR36635991", "Content": "This hotel review will answer most of your convictions about this hotel. The first thing you need to know when booking at this hotel is that there are two parts to this hotel, one is much cleaner and all around better than the other. You can probably see that people have left bad reviews, mostly because they got stuck with the poor rooms. This is the third time in the last four years that my family has stayed at this hotel. Here is what I recommend for booking the hotel: 1. Call into the hotel early. You don't want to be stuck with limited choices. 2. Ask for a room on the inside third or fourth floors. You dollar goes furthest on these two floors. I specify inside because there is a portion of the hotel where you would have to go up the elevator and then walk outdoors to get to your room. The rooms here are in much worse shape. We were stuck with room 402 two years ago. 3. If you have a whole family of 4 with you, try to get a corner room. We got room 410 four years ago and loved it so much that we called this year to reserve that very room. The corner rooms are significantly larger that the average room, have two toilets and two sinks, along with a cozy breakfast nook. Okay, now it's time for the review. For a two-star hotel, it's rather nice. Again, our room review comes from #410, so please be aware of this. From the broad perspective, the room is pleasant. Upon the entrance is the breakfast nook that is next to the kitchen, which is situated against the wall opposite the door. Across from the kitchen is that bathroom sink with the toilet and full bath on either side of it. Down further are the beds, which seem fresh and clean. At the very end of the room is the living area with a decent tv. If you're used to HD flat screen, this will seem like the stone age, but for me, it worked fine. The balcony has a great view of the ocean, and circles around the room for a view of the bay side. If you weren't looking for flaws, then you probably wouldn't find them. But a closer look, one would noticed the out-dated appliance of the 1980-90's era. The wallpaper has scuff markings on it, and the bathroom door is chipped at the bottom. These things are nitpicky, but remember that you can't be too critical with a hotel. The staff seems to be friendly. The maids do an acceptable job. It upsets me to see the stuff they have to deal with. During our stay, someone had dropped dead hermit crabs all over the hallways. However, the hotel responded quickly by bringing in Stanley Steamer to clean the carpets. The hotel has two pools, one indoor, one outdoor. The indoor pool is probably the nicest in ocean city, with depths starting at 3' and going down to 8'. The indoor area also has a hot tub and sauna. The outdoor pool is much more kid-friendly, with depths of 3' to 4'. Other features of the hotel is an arcade, which has about ten different arcade-style games, and a pay-to-play pool table. The fitness room is disappointing, with only stairmasters and a treadmill. A useful feature of this hotel is the laundry room, so you won't have to do as much laundry when you go home. The hotel has a restaurant with a la carte menus. Hope this helps.

The railing appeared as if it was previously damaged: it appears as if it is pushed outward and bent. The photo reveals its appearance and there appear to be repaired cracks in the concrete. This presented another safety hazard to anyone caught leaning to see the ocean. Hence, the porch was unusable. The fixtures in the rooms were opulent until one looked into the details. The beds were too small and the fold open sofa was uncomfortable. Glass tubed television sets were present as was a kitchenette with a defective stove. There is bedding for four in the suite but the coffee maker drips out only four cups at a time. The bathroom is also opulent but the commode\u2019s pull chain broke necessitating a visit from maintenance. Internet was offered as free wireless but rarely worked. We had to contact \u201cethostream\u201d to learn that there was a router error in the building causing the system to fail to connect to the internet. A low signal back up worked but caused internet connections to be unreliable. This is a decent place catering to up scale clientele. The core is solid but it is clear that the recession has taken its toll. It\u2019s a Quality Inn with de minimus outlay for expenses and the price was too high for the overall accommodation.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cdont stay here\u201d", "Author": "brucef1960", "ReviewID": "UR33617109", "Content": "spent four nights here..room was dirty found soda can under bed first day left it there to see what would hapen still there day 4 poor house keeping.. stayed on third floor hallway smelled and room smelled..vanity in bathroom was moldy and rotted. dried food on wall and around stove in kitchen..furniture looked like it was bought at flea market..rooms need updated i asked the house keeper if all the rooms were like this..all she said was' 'you need room clean.''.other words she did not understand english..would have asked for another room but figured they were all the same..if you have ever stayed in a hotel with any class you will not like it here. not worth $1100.00 for four nights", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cWORST HOTEL EVER!!!

Wanted to escape for the Christmas holiday and got a rate of $43.00 per night for a standard King room by booking through an airline for the 250 mile bonus. We called the hotel twice before we booked and found the gentleman we talked to to be very helpful, and pleasant in answering our questions. Since we were staying during Christmas, we knew that dining in the area would be limited. When we arrived, the gentleman at the desk had hand written the hours of some local restaurants on paper and had it copied for the guests. He was just as pleasant in person greeting us upon our arrival. There were no area maps available, so on Christmas day the woman at the front desk wrote directions to Assateague Island for us. Being that the hotel was empty, check-in was a breeze. Our king room was on the 6th floor facing the street, with a partial view of the ocean and good view of the bay. The room had a refridge, coffee machine, dishwasher, hair dryer, small table w/2 chairs, stove and one upholstered chair in the corner. Also a balcony w/table and chairs. Big TV with plenty of basic cable channels. The bed was comfy, but the pillows were not. If you're a two pillow person, better stick to one in this hotel or face a stiff neck in the morning. Had a problem with the heat not working, and as we discussed calling the front desk, a maintenance worker arrived at our door and had it working in 2 minutes. Seemed that it was hooked up to a central system which detected faults. Although we didn't partake, the indoor pool and area seemed very clean. It was located in an atrium area with plenty of daylight. The games room had a few pinball machines, among other games, and a pool table. Would have enjoyed shooting a game of pool, but the cues were missing tips and there was no chalk. I think it was $1 per game, but could be wrong. The exercise room was fine, and also had a TV. There was a small business area also, and free wifi throughout the hotel. Left the laptop home with the rest of my business affairs for this trip, so didn't get to checkout the speed or signal reception.

I was a bit trepidatious about choosing a hotel. After much research (and reading some negative reviews regarding cleanliness), I settled on this facility because the price was right and it was on the ocean. I figured what the heck, I never clean my own house much so how bad could it be in comparison? I was in for a pleasant surprise. Immaculate. Large rooms. No one else around (imagine it might get a bit noisy in season). Balcony on the ocean (yes, it was worth paying more to have the waves lull us to sleep). Loved the jacuzzi bath tub. Sadly, the pool was only open some of the time but we were too in thrall with our ocean view to care much. In October, not much is open but we didn't mind at all. If you are an older couple on a limited budget, I highly recommend staying here during the fall/winter months when you will be basically by yourselves if you book during the week. I can see where Ocean City might get very noisy in the summer - which younger couples might not mind. I'm 53 and I don't need the headaches. No headaches here in October.

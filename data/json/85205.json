I understand they were at full capacity this week it being during spring break, however, I was disappointed to receive a handicap room when checking in Sunday-Friday for such a long stay. By the time I got to my room late that evening I did not feel like moving my heavy bags to another room so did not approach the front desk. There was no counter space at all in my bathroom and no color of art on the far wall of my room making it for a dull experience. My colleague's bathroom was much better other than her hole in the shower ceiling. I spent many evenings in my room and this did not feel like a home away from home. I travel frequently for work and this is something I anticipate. The beds were very comfortable, but did not offer a sheet. I woke up many times very warm at night. The rooms were a little outdated and could use some work. I could also easily hear my neighbors next to my room. Would I stay at your hotel again?

The hotel is nice, but what it is not is French in the least - some French phrases and marketing excepted. Nor are the beds, but the beds are very nice and a highlight. Free wifi is a plus, and not as common as one might think. I had a corner room with view of both lagoon/airport and city; the airport is practically inaudible. (Contrary to a Sweet Sixteen party at the pool the night we came, which really wrooomed through all the walls, but mercifully ended at a decent time - still, not nice if you would want to sleep after a long flight.) We did some work at the lobby and lounge, which as the entire hotel is a bit tired and worn, but still servicable.

The concierge arranged a one day car rental for us, and what was supposed to be a 15 minute wait for the shuttle to take us to our car ended up being an hour, which was annoying. As others have reported, the airport shuttle was also a little loose in terms of its schedule - it was supposed to come every 30 minutes, but that seems more like an aspiration. And given how many people and bags they jam onto each van, it's more like an hourly shuttle. We ended up taking a cab for $15- money well spent in my mind, and definitely eased the stress of transitioning to the airport.

It very much exceeded our expectations for an airport hotel, and more than made up for the issues I mentioned above.

Over the years their shuttle has downgraded and the rooms are getting close to being in need of an upgrade. There are not many shops/restaurants in the vicinity and eating/drinking in the hotel can quickly add up to more than your room. They are very good about accommodating late check out requests. The worst change has been in their loyalty program, the old program was great, they knew I was a frequent visitor, provided quick check-in at the concierge, frequent room upgrades, and a free drink coupon.

We flew into Miami and spent one night at this hotel before our flight to Antigua the next day. We contacted the hotel prior to retrieving our bags to ask the shuttle to pick us up. Once we had our bags we did have to wait for the shuttle but he got there and off we went to the hotel. The hotel is literally about 2 miles from the airport. Once we got to the hotel, it was very impressive and so were the staff. Everyone was very friendly and wanted to ensure we had an enjoyable stay. We had a room on a upper level floor that looked toward downtown Miami. The room was very nice and the bed was really comfortable. There isn't much right around the hotel (restaurants etc) but a taxi is easy enough to get. We liked that it had a bar and restaurant as well as a Starbucks right at the hotel. On our return from Antigua we stayed another night at this hotel. Since we came back in the International terminal and the shuttle picks up at the domestic terminal, we decided to get a cab instead of trying to figure out how to find the shuttle etc. Our flight back to Phoenix wasn't until 5:00 p.m. the next day so we decided we wanted to get some beers instead of paying hotel bar prices. We asked the concierge and instead of getting us a taxi, he took us to the grocery store. It was short walk back to the hotel, but we didn't mind. On our return trip, we had a similar room and again the bed is very comfortable. Again the staff was very friendly and helpful as we were trying to plan what to do before our flight home. The hotel was too far to take a cab to South Beach as it would have been around $40 + tip one way and we didn't have that much time. We decided to go to the outlet mall and shop! So much fun! We took a cab there and back and I think it was $40 total. The hotel stored our bags and since we knew the shuttle ran every 1/2 hour to the airport we could plan accordingly to get back in time to get our bags and get on the shuttle. Once we got back to the hotel, we grabbed our bags, they gave us a bottle of water and off to the airport we went.

The main difference was the exceptional customer service we received at the Sofitel compared to the Sheraton. The shuttle drivers were fast and friendly both directions, the check-in was quick and easy, the concierge was enthusiastically helpful, and the bartender was very personable. All of this is in complete contrast to our experience at the Sheraton.

The room was OK- not quite as nice as we expected, but, it's an airport hotel, so there you are. We went down to the bar and I ordered a glass of house wine. The bartender was very friendly, and we paid the bill as we wanted to take our drinks out by the pool and watch the sunset. The glass of house wine was $16! With no alternative in sight, we stayed put, stuck to the plan and had dinner as well. The food was pricey as you would expect with drink prices like that, but it was good. At the end of the evening, we realized that we had spent more on the drinks and the meal than we had for two days worth of eating and drinking in Costa Rica. The most negative part of the visit to this hotel was that when we got up to catch the first shuttle in the morning to the airport so we could make our flight home, the shuttle driver didn't appear until almost 20 minutes after the shuttle was supposed to leave. By the time he warmed up the vehicle, etc. it was almost 1/2 an hour late. There were a lot of unhappy people standing around waiting, by the time we left the hotel property.

Shuttle was full, had to wait an extra 30mins. When we get there people at the front desk were extremely nice and helpful. No complaints about staff. Check in was just a matter of mins, very happy with that. Although when we walked into the room we were hoping to see a really nice, remodeled room. Negative, rooms are old, outdated, bathroom literally had hairs everywhere, toilet wouldn't flush properly. The bed was amazing though, very comfortable. La Riviera is awfully expensive for the food they serve. Went down to a Denny's, my wife and I ate two plates filled to the top for $15 , what one meal not even half of a plate costs. There's no free internet, they have only 4 computers which are old and 2 aren't even connected to printer. Parking is charged $9.00+ tax per NIGHT. Stayed at Holiday Inn at Orlando few days before and it was free being a regular hotel. And what the hell is up with those hats staff wear at parking gate? That doesn't give it any \"french feel\" whatsoever. Wife couldn't stop laughing at that, beyond ridiculous. Short drive to airport, close to convenience stores, ate some yummy cuban food at a restaurant called Poyo Tropical, would definitely recommend it. Really cheap and close by for those late night munchies. Overall for the total $$ we spent it wasn't what we expected. Don't let the pictures online fool you. Don't understand why such a big hotel, with so many people staying (day the we checked in there was a couple in front of us trying to get a room and they were full, old lady told us it was like that most of the times) hasn't been updated. Needs a lot of things, has the potential to be a 5 star hotel but if they don't want to spend money on fixing it, their loss. Staying at Sunny Isles hotel next time.

There's no refrigerator in the room, but you can request one for no charge; but I don't know how many the hotel has available to spare. Checking out was interesting, there was only one elevator working and almost everyone was trying to make check out time at the same time. We were on a higher floor so we were not going to walk down stairs with our luggage. It was ridiculous how they tried to squeeze so much luggage and people into the elevator; it was very claustrophobic. But when we finally made it down to the lobby it was an easy and fast check out; no problems. PROS: Location to Airport for short business trips and one night stay before/after a cruise. CONS: Dated bathrooms, elevator service, restaurant prices, and hair all over bathroom walls and doors (they were literally stuck onto the wall).

Large t.v with plenty of channels to choose from, and the bathroom was very modern with a good shower. The room was on the top floor so consequently we has an amazing view of all the hundreds of different firework displays in Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Reception staff were very helpful but have this French vibe going on which I didn't quite understand. The reception is nicely decorated, but the elevators are ancient, and it was sometimes frustrating having to wait up to 10 minutes for one to come. The bar was overpriced so we only used it twice, the same food served in the bar is available on room service which we has a couple of times. Food again was expensive but very good. The pool area to the rear was really nicely kept and is a real sun trap. The hotel is very near to the airport (quite interesting to watch the planes take off and land) but we didn't really notice any noise. There is a supermarket and a laundry nearby as well as some fast food places. If you hire a car it's very easy to get to the main roads from the hotel. The hotel does a free shuttle to and from the airport ( flag the sofitel bus down outside the Entrance to 'Departures'), and also a pay shuttle to Dolphin Mall and Miami Port. Don't understand why the parking is so expensive. Don't know the wifi is so expensive either.

It is not in the same league: it's more along the lines of a Holiday Inn Express or a freeway motor hotel. First, the room (a mini-suite with a living room and separate bedroom). The decoration is very stark and not at all \"nice\" or \"elegant\" (I usually don't even pay attention to these things, but this room stood out). The room we were given had a picture on the floor that had fallen off, which immediately demonstrated that we were in a low-caliber establishment). For a suite, this room was very small. Second, the bathtub filler didn't work and kept bouncing back to shower mode (we wanted a bath for our child, not a shower). Third, the phones didn't really work correctly in that after 15 minutes of calling room service and getting a busy signal, I finally called the front desk to ask what was wrong, and they simply connected me right away. I guess they do this to slow down people's use of room service? No idea. It was super-annoying. Next, when I did order room service, the food finally came after about 30 minutes and part of my order was wrong. I called room service (again, using the front desk as a switchboard, not the little button on the phone) and explained. 30 later minutes and I had the last entree. It was luke-warm. The food was \"decent\" but not great. The prices were typically high for a high-end hotel which this is not. The location is close to the airport, although still a 15 minute jaunt around it. The noise from the airport is bad as the property is not far enough away from the runway yet is not \"super-insulated\" like some hotels right on the tarmac. It's the worst of both worlds--you hear low rumbling all night long. If you don't pay very much (viz. get some kind of discount) and don't expect anything fancy, this hotel might work for you, but it's certainly not a Sofitel like others I've visited.

I prepaid for this room months ago and got a very good price. However, upon our arrival, we were given a room on the second floor that had a totally obstructed view of the lagoon. There was a huge, white colored enclosed tent/canopy extending the entire length of this side of the building. So, all we got to see when we pulled the drapes open was this monstrosity. No view whatsoever. So, naturally we didn't want to look at this tent/canopy, so we never had the drapes open. I also requested a smoking room, so I guess this room is where we evil smokers get relegated to - to the second floor room with no view. (I have stayed in other hotels that allow smoking and have NEVER been put in such a room as this one.) Additionally, the interior of this room was anything but luxurious and the carpet needed replacing a long time ago. I also noted there was not a top sheet on either bed. Bottom line - I am not sure if I got this room because I reserved it at a prepaid, special internet rate or because I am a smoker. But either way, the room was sub-par. If it was because of the special internet rate, then when I called the hotel they should have told me the room would be substandard due to the rate I paid. If I was given this room because I am a smoker, then if the hotel does not want smokers as guests then they should not offer rooms to smokers. To give an inferior room to a guest for possibly either one of these reasons is wrong because my money is as good as any other guest who stays there. And if it wasn't for either of these reasons, then this hotel needs to stop touting itself as a \"luxury\" property in Miami as I experienced firsthand anything but \"luxury.\" I also inquired about the business center as I needed to print out my airline tickets. I was told there was a computer and printer I could use for this task.

They have nice flat screen tv's and even a bose soundwave in the room but they stuck out as the furnishings and fittings, especially in the bathroom were worse than that in a motel 6. The room just didnt feel clean, maybe it was the stale smell but i could hardly sleep as i thought the bed was probably riddled with bugs. I couldnt wait to get up in the morning and move on in our travels Im sorry, i wouldnt recommend this hotel, its a bit of a dump to be honest that they have tried to tart up with fancy tv's & radios", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cSimply wonderful\u201d", "Author": "apperley17", "ReviewID": "UR65371226", "Content": "After a 10 hour flight to Miami, we were taken to the Sofitel for one night before we joined a cruise ship.

There was a newsagent and a couple of other small shops nearby, but you will be lucky if you can get anything other than essentials. We couldn't find anywhere to eat, so we went back to the hotel where they were running a wine and buffet evening. We choose to have a pizza and burger, both which were freshly made and very tasty, before lounging by the pool for a couple of hours with a beer. It was a small pool, but kept clean and relatively warm. There was a great view over a lake. Towels were available and employees kept coming round tidying up glasses / sun loungers / ashtrays. Couldn't fault it. Breakfast was perhaps the highlight. My husband ordered pastries and I had blueberry pancakes. All of a sudden 2 waitresses approached with fresh fruit, pastries, syrups, jams, juice, coffee. It was amazing. All fresh too. Check in and checkout was quick and easy. The staff were all very polite and eager to help. I suppose the only downside is that it is outside of Miami (about 15 minute drive). Reception were happy to order taxis, but it isn't the most convenient place to stay if you want the hustle and bustle of Miami. Given that we were just there for one night, this didn't bother us.

I had an amazing experience, from start to finish. I was travelling to South Beach daily, and even with the costs of cabs, this hotel was STILL cheaper than anything in South Beach, and it was like an oasis away from the hustle of the city. I am typically a picky traveller, and usually stay Hyatt, Fairmont, W - 4 star minimum. This hotel was in that calibre, and had a welcoming European feel. LOCATION The Sofitel is located close to the airport ($12 cab ride) however the hotel offers a free and convenient shuttle. There is also a $10 (round trip) shuttle to a local outlet mall. It is a 15-20 minute ride, but luckily Sofitel is the last pick up, and the first drop off. Otherwise, there is not much around the hotel. Miami Beach/South Beach is approx. a 20 minute cab ride away, and this costs $38-$40 with tip, per way. HOTEL The hotel is clean, and modern, and nicely laid out. The elevators are right in the centre of the lobby, as is some seating. There is a small gift shop, and a great Starbucks for breakfast/coffees. The hotel is located on a lagoon, which affords beautiful views and a nice setting for their pool. The pool is clean, and offers thick cushioned loungers, with plenty of towels, and lots of shaded or sun areas. The pool area is small, but you feel like you are at a resort. There is also a free internet cafe/business area, which was a nice touch. Wireless service is provided at a small fee $7.99, but it was worth it, as it works anywhere in the hotel. RESTAURANTS You can choose from dining room, sitting at the bar, or sitting in the bar/lounge area. All food was TERRIFIC, as were the drinks (and the tasty complimentary bar snacks). Breakfast can be selected from the restaurant, Starbucks, or room service. Lots of great options at any price. ROOMS The rooms were clean, modern, and comfortable. The bathroom is a typical marble bath, but nice and clean, and well maintained. The bed has a thick fluffy white duvet - which to me is the standard for a 4+ hotel! It is changed as often as you like, and the bed and pillows were super comfortable. The only complaint might be the noise of the planes. As far as hotels go, it was quiet, however you do get a gentle wake up call at 6:00 a.m. when the planes start departing. As I said, even with the planes it was no noiser than a typical hotel, and this did not bother me. SERVICE The service at this hotel was OUTSTANDING, from the bellman, to the concierge, to front desk, to restaurant staff. It was just amazing. Everyone was helpful, and friendly, and had a smile on their face. Bottom line - a great experience!

We were in South Beach but decided to stay closer to the airport. Since we've stayed at Sofitels in other cities, we figured it would be the same. Did not book through third party, but with hotel directly, so we paid more for the room, but I'm learning that hotels often treat customers who use third party systems differently - so this was kind of an experiment. Reservations person on the phone was extremely nice and when I asked a nice room for the night and a late check out (since we were going to have to spend the day there) and she assured us we would get that. She also extended a 10% discount even though we didn't have a AAA card with us, no questions asked. We arrived by taxi, so parking wasn't an issue. The bellhop whisked our bags into the lobby with a smile and it didn't seem as though he was angling for a large tip at all - in fact, he walked away and we followed to compensate him appropriately. We checked in and I reminded the front desk about my phone conversation regarding nice room and late check out. All was fine and we were given a corner room on the 14th floor. and again, service with a smile. I might add here that we were dressed very casually as we had just spent the day tooling around South Beach in a gocar and we were not profiled in any way. The hotel lobby is separated in that the upper lobby is check in and a coffee spot, the lower lobby is the bar, restaurant and seating , which I liked. It's very open, airy and nicely decorated. Our room was lovely with a great view of the lagoons on one side and the city on the other with the pool below. Seemed quite clean, although there was a long hair along the rim in the sink. The shower pressure was quite weak, but the bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels and nice amenities. The bed was very comfortable and you can see in the pics that my husband lay down as soon as we got into the room and promptly fell asleep. Yes, there is airplane noise but not terrible and the hotel is situated near the airport so what the heck do you expect? The pool area was nice even though the red, white and blue colors are a little weird. It was too chilly to use the pool but I could see it being quite pleasant on a nice day. We decided to just hang out in the hotel for the next day (there really isn't anywhere to walk to as far as I could tell, so one wouldn't want to come here for the surrounding area). We relaxed in the lower lobby most of the day and the wait service was great. Polite, pleasant and helpful. We had a light lunch and a few cocktails. A stroll around the pool, watched some TV and other people. The food was very good. The restaurant was beautiful but we didn't eat there, we opted to just hang in the lobby. All in all, a very nice stay although it all kind of fell apart when we got on the shuttle to the airport. The driver was a bit clueless and kept forgetting where everyone was getting off. We had to remind him to stop at one of the terminals for a couple going to the UK. He was picking up people as well as dropping off, so it was getting a bit crowded. He actually told us to get off and walk to the other end of the terminal so there could be a few more seats on the shuttle for pickups! We refused. Unbelievable! It was as if he didn't know where any of the airline drop offs were.

Upon driving up to the hotel, I was shocked. Not only is the building painted a terrible red and blue, it is also very dirty and looked like it was falling apart. When we pulled up to the gate, we were told we had to pay $12/day to park ( normally I don't mind, but then again I normally stay in 4 star hotels that actually are 4 stars). While walking from the parking lot to the lobby, I realized that I had to walk up a flight of stairs with all of my luggage. There was no ramp to walk up. Not for me and my associates carrying all of our luggage, and not for any handicapped people. The lobby decor was ok, but it's starting date itself. The pool was so small, I didn't even think about going in. The Sleeping Room - Small. Very outdated. Ant infested. Low lighting in the bathroom. Everything in the bathroom was very short. I had to bend over to use the sink and dry my hands on the little towel hanger - and I'm only 5'4\"!!! When ever I had to use the toilet, I felt like I was sitting on the ground! There was also hair on the floor when I checked in. No coffee maker anywhere in the room. They have those at every hotel, even the $35 a night ones! No refrigerator. And strangest of all - no sheet to cover up with on the bed. Just a fitted sheet to lay on, and a heavy comforter to cover up with. Very strange, and hard to keep comortable at night. Also didn't help that the bed was hard as a rock. Everytime the air conditioning kicked on, it made a VERY loud knocking sound. The walls are paper thin. I could hear my neighbors' TV and their conversations. I stayed for 4 days, and my room key broke every single one. I had to stop and get a new key, every day. Location - Terrible. I guess it is somewhat convenient due to the close proximity to the airport, but I would rather drive 10 more minutes down the road and not hear airplanes all night while I'm trying to sleep. My room shook when some of them took off. That is too close to the airport. Also, not a good neighborhood. Meeting Space - Small, but adequate. Staff interupted the meeting constantly to check in us. It was very distracting. They also cleared out the snack/coffee area during our meetings instead of during our breaks. We had boxed lunches everyday for lunch, and none of the sandwhiches were labeled as to what kind they were. It was a guessing game every day. The convention bathrooms were disgusting. Dirty, cracked tile floors with holes in it. The ceiling also had holes in it and had large water stains all over the place. Overall, I was very dissappointed. I am very glad that my company paid for my stay, otherwise I would have left after the first night. Don't waste your time here.

My husband and I arrived on a Wednesday night after many hours of travel from Barbados. We were dressed casually, which is an absolute no-no for this hotel, apparently. From the moment we walked in the door, we were assessed by the staff as people who did not belong. The hotel shuttle driver was incredibly rude and practically ripped the bags out of our hands though we insisted that we could handle the small carry ons. If you don't feel it's appropriate to leave a $20 tip for the person who opens the door for you, find a better hotel. We decided to eat elsewhere because we were exhausted and the hotel restaurant is anything but casual - I'm sure it's fine, but it was late and we had to be up at 4am the next morning. We were told about a great restaurant a 10 minute walk away by the concierge, and they offered to take us in the hotel's towncar. When we got to the concierge desk, the driver, the concierge and one other individual took one look at our casual clothes and began talking in Spanish about how much we might tip, saying \"do you think it's 5 or 10?\" \"make sure you have change\" and a few other rude things. To the Sofitel: You're in Miami. Don't assume that your drivers are the only people who speak Spanish, okay? Despite this, we tipped the driver generously because that was the expectation. It was a 3 minute drive. He promised us that he would return as soon as we had the restaurant call the hotel. We finished our meal, our waiter told us that he had contacted the driver who would arrive in 5 minutes, and 15 minutes later we decided to take the 10 minute walk back to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel 20 minutes after we should have been picked up, the driver was walking out of the door toward the car. He pretended that no one had called, that he wasn't walking toward the car to come get us very late, but it was very clear that he was lying and that the folks dressed in casual clothes don't deserve prompt attention, even though our money was just as green as the guests on business trips. The rooms are small. They're nothing special. I'm so glad we received this hotel free, or we would've walked across the street to a hotel with staff that treats people with respect, regardless of how they are dressed.

We called the manager about it and he told us that they could not guarantee the type of room when you make a reservation with them. We were so exhausted that we didn't do anything about it. The manager gave us a voucher for breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel to make up for all the inconvenience. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and left the hotel the next morning for our cruise.

He was talking to a girl in the gift shop. I checked in. That was ok, very fast. Ran out to my car again, and it was the same thing. No doorman to greet or assist. Now he was gossiping with the concierge. The upgraded room, which was $289, and an additonal $10.00 for Internet, was small, outdated. The 22\" TV didn't work. For what I was paying, I was expecting a large flat screen, something modern, as you seem to find in most hotels today. The couch had stains. There were M&M's under the bed and Dorito crumbs under the love seat. In other words, the room wasn't clean. When you shut the bedroom door, you have to hold back the curtains, as they obstruct you from closing the door completey. At 11:30 that night, housekeeping had to bring me up sheets as there weren't any on the bed. I called down stairs to ask about soda, vending machines. I was told on every floor there were ice machines, but no soda or vending machines. Wrong. Most of the floors don't have ice machines and those that do, they don't work. If you want ice, you have to go to the downstairs bar. If you want a bottle of water, you'll pay $7.00. If you want a tiny bottle of free water, you have to track down the concierge, who's usually talking to the doorman, and when you do get it's at best, room temp. Two small bottles of diet coke cost me $9.00. The bathroom floor had hair on it. I stayed there 5 days ago. My final charges were $333.00. But they charged $333.00, $339.00 and $339.47 to my card. I am still trying to get them to fix this. When I call the hotel and ask for accounting, all I get is a voice mail. Yesterday the desk manager told me that somebody would call me by days end.

We were on a family cruise and the Sofitel was our post cruise hotel. It was a convenient location, free shuttle to the airport. the next morning for our flight back home. We got off the cruise ship and headed to the hotel in our rental car. The first thing we noticed was that you had to pay for parking! I did not think that was necessary in a hotel where there wasn't much around anyways, mostly office buildings and parking did not look like it was at a premium. We were early checking in and wanted to drop our bags off first because we were planning on spending our day at Sawgrass Outlet Mall (which is amazing!). It was around 12 and no rooms were available so we put all of our luggage/bags on one cart and asked the bellhop to store our stuff and when our room was ready, just to put all of the luggage/bags into one room and we would deal with it when we got back. We did tip him and he did put all of our stuff in one room which was great. We shopped all day and by the time we got back at the hotel after dinner, it was late. We decided to return the rental car instead and that way we did not have to pay for the parking. We were all so tired by the end of this and we still had to pack/re-arrange our luggage to make room for our purchases from Sawgrass. When I walked into the room, what a surprise. The room looked very old/worn, nothing like the pictures! The red door to our room looked like it was from the beginning of time! The carpet looked gross and dirty, the walls needed a paint job, the washroom did not even look that clean! There was actually a used q-tip on the floor under the sink! My brother took a shower and he said there was no water pressure and it was not draining properly, he was in 3inches of water while showering! I did not bother to even shower. We had 2 queen beds that looked very nice, presentation wise. I was looking so forward to just getting some sleep but it was the worst bed I have ever slept in! It must have been 20 years old! I was afraid to pull the beds sheets off the bed just to look at the mattress. It was so soft/un-supporting that I just sunk in. I woke-up with a sore back of course.

Also, I wanted a pair of slippers (not already in the room) to go to the swimming pool but getting the message across to the spanish-speaking maids proved VERY difficult.

I loved this hotel. On arrival at the hotel, we were checked in and in a lift up to our room literally within 5 minutes of walking through the front door! The check in agent was friendly and helpful, and the whole process trouble free. The room was lovely. There were two double beds, with really comfy matress toppers and lovely fluffy pillows. The TV had loads of channels, and there was a massive wardrobe with plenty of coathangers (although I didn't use this as only overnight). There was also a chez longe (no, I have no idea how to spell that), and a large desk and chair, with stationery. The bathroom was really clean, and quite luxurious. The water pressure and temperature was perfect for showering, and there were lovely toiletries and shoe shines. The rooms were nice and quiet, and I heard no traffic or airport noise. The bar was well stocked, and the bar staff friendly. In the bar area there were 5 (I think) computers with internet access, totally free to use. These kept the kids occupied while we had a drink. There is an outside pool, although I would never have gone in it because it was quite cold, the kids, who don't feel the cold, were in like a shot! There were tables and chairs, and sun loungers around the pool, and pool towels provided. The hotel has a free shuttle bus between the airport and hotel. Stand outside airport arrivals, and when you see a bus with Sofitel Miami on it, hail it down and jump in. The transfer took us about 10 minutes. When you want to get back to the airport, just wait outside the lobby and jump in the next bus. It's all very easy, and free. Overall, I loved this hotel, and if I ever need an overnight at Miami airport again, I will definately choose this hotel.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "milton keynes", "Title": "\u201cgreat stopover\u201d", "Author": "chip1784", "ReviewID": "UR12803627", "Content": "Having one night stopover in miami between flights it could not of worked better.

Since we didn't have a rental car, they provided a driver to drive us to a local restaurant at no charge. The one downside about the hotel that I can mention is the menu prices. I checked the restaurant menu and the entree's were very pricey, all $20+. So we ordered room service for a light meal. Two panini bread sandwichs with fries and a liter bottle of water: $42.00!

When we arrived at the airport we got a taxi rather than wait for the shuttle - we were tired and also there are 4 of us. It was only a few minutes away anyway. Arriving at the property was initially a little disappointing - the hotel have made (in my opinion) a mistake by having a little shop right inside the entrance which serves to rob the hotel of an impressive atrium entrance that I like in these sort of hotels. There was a further disappointment - we had two rooms. When we arrived in one there was a sink full of recent ice and empty beer bottles in the bathroom so we had to move and ended up on different floors (7 and 9)! I also found the planning of the light switches in the room to be odd - we arrived in the dark and spent several minutes feeling the walls looking for non-existent switches - they are all on the wall and floor lights. Also, as someone else said, there is only one robe in each wardrobe? Please do read on because, after a slighty faltering start, it just got better and better. Good points - The public rooms are truly lovely - classy, art-deco style. The pool area is great - plentiful towels and never busy. The view from the rooms over the lagoon is lovely and restful even though the airplanes are landing just behind it. In fact we quite enjoyed watching the planes - you could just hear them but it was not a problem. The beds were absolutely gorgeous - featherbeds to lie on and top-quality linen. The concierge was very helpful - as we left for the football he handed us four bottles of ice-cold water telling us to take care in the heat. I thought the restaurant was very good indeed. Others have said that it was expensive - maybe by US standards but by European, not so much so. Besides, it was worth it. The room was a very stylish white with touches of red glassware and the like. You might need to cover shoulders - the air-conditioning was pretty 'full on'. The breakfast in particular was lovely - I had a continental which consisted of a basket of lovely bread and pastries made by the resident French chef. My family had cooked plates that were also great. We were also presented with complimentary strawberry smoothies. We ate two breakfasts and a dinner there and everything was good - I would have preferred my apple pie served hot however. There was also a little cafe situated behing the restaurant - many people bought breakfast there and then walked back through the restaurant to the bar / lounge situated overlooking the pool area.

I went back to see if they were still there and the girl told me she would check and see if they were in lost and found.

I went back down the stairs to ask the girl about it and she said she would check into it and call me up in the room. I waited and waited and finally I got a call.

So as to avoid giving my details again and chance them losing it I said I would pay when I got there which he agreed. Now I secretly hoped that for the cock up that they would maybe upgrade me or at least offer me something. Nope! I ended up getting a cab because I waited so long at the airport for the shuttle that I didn't think the shuttle was going to turn up. When I got out of the cab there wasn't any bellman, just an elderly security guard who ended up having to bring my bags in for me. I felt awful as this man shouldn't have been lifting heavy bags (but he was sweet and insisted) I think the bellman turned up slightly later when I had finished checking in. Checking in wasn't great. I gave the girl my credit card and asked if it was going through as I'd been having problems on my holiday with the card going through sometimes and then other times not. She said it was fine and then five minutes later she asked me to pay in cash and pay extra cash if I thought I was going to charge anything to the room. When I enquired again about my card she just replied \"oh yeah that hasn't gone through so will you pay in cash now\". It's stupid but that really annoyed me. I had other cards to give her and I specifically asked her and explained the problem. It also didn't help that another girl came out from the room behind laughing and then then the two of them decided to have a conversation and giggle and laugh in front of me as if I suddenly wasn't there. Not really what I expected from a decent hotel. Anyway, going to the room I thought that the coridors felt really grotty and old. It felt as if I was walking through a 1 or 2 star hotel and I expected to see bit padlocks on the doors. The room was nice but it was old. Everything felt just a bit grotty although I couldn't specifically point out one thing. I felt nervous as well there for some reason and double locked the room. I had a flight in the morning and had asked for wake up call and fortunately I woke up early with a headache as I never received the wake up call. Good thing I was up as I could have easily missed my flight. You would think that an airport hotel would make wake up calls a priority point for them as their main customers are people who stay whilst in transit. I felt disappointed with this hotel.

However, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at this Sofitel, try to ask for a room far from the ice machine because it can be very noisy. Breakfast at their restaurant was good enough. Even though the hotel is very near the airport you can hardly hear the airplanes so I imagine they have some kind of sound insulation (or I simply passed out and did not hear any noise at all...). The only setback was that at first we were given a room which was already taken by someone else because when we entered the room we found bags and glasses over the beds. So I imagine that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better be careful with your belongings but in fact I believe this can happen to anyone.... All in all I think it was a nice stay and I believe it is a good hotel for those who want to be near the airport, but of course there are hotels in Miami that are much nicer than this Sofitel.

Our only big complaint was that the pool was very dirty and the guests partying around the pool were very offensive and used very offensive language, I was appalled that management did not address this, we had our young son with us so we did not spend much time around the pool because of this.

We had stayed a few days earlier at The Hyatt Maimi (my review on this was poor) before heading down to Key West for a few nights then back to Miaimi. We wished we had stayed in this hotel for the earlier nights. Whilst not centrally located, its only about 10-15 minutes drive to downtown Maimi, we would recommend it. Check in was great - we also got upgraded to a suite, the suite was wonderful, very large separate bathroom, huge separate lounge area and quite a spacious bathrom. The bar area looked pleasant and we took drinks out by the pool and relaxed for an hour or so which was pleasant. This hotel that night had a lot of English people staying in it before leaving for Caribean Cruises so a lot of cheeful conversation with other guests which added to the ambience. . We had dinner in their main restaurant which was superb, the service was very good and the food was excellent. We decided to have coffee in the bar area and this is where it all fell apart. The Bar area is quite large and people were also eating snacks. After about 10 minutes of trying to get a waiters attention my husband gave up and went and found one. He was quite rude and we explained we only wanted coffee and a liquor told us we would have a big wait as they were more concerned about serving the food people. We then left immediately. Fortunately for us the Manager of the Restaurant was passing as we left and could see we were not happy, he took us back into his Restaurant and organised our coffee straight away. ( It was not complimentary ) but he did at least seemed concerned re our plight. Would recommend this restaurant for business travellers or couples and tourists if you dont mind staying near the airport.

We paid $65/night for each stay, thanks to Priceline. The Sofitel has a free shuttle to/from the airport. It leaves the hotel every half-hour on the hour. We landed in Miami around 11pm (our flight was delayed). We didn't feel like waiting for the shuttle (we had our 4-year-old with us and it had been a long day), so we took a taxi. Cost: $16 (not including tip). There was one gentleman at the front desk and no line. He was on the phone with what sounded to me like a hotel customer. He said he'd help me in a bit. Meantime, another couple arrived and the concierge said she would check them in. I internally debated whether I should say we were here first but decided to just let it go. I believe that because I chose not to make a big deal about it and said it was okay when the guy apologized for the delay, he upgraded us to a suite on the 5th floor, King bed and non-smoking. He really didn't have to do that and I certainly was not expecting him to, so that was a really nice surprise. We've stayed in a standard room at this hotel in the past and the suite was definitely an improvement, although at the end of the day this is still just an airport hotel. The suite has a sitting room with 2 sofas, table, tv, desk and 2 chairs. The bedroom was a bit on the small side. The bathroom is what you'd find in any standard room. The suite looked a bit worn. The carpet and sofas had a few stains. The wooden furniture had a few dings to it. We ordered room service before going to bed: buffalo wings and a grilled turkey breast sandwich. Our food was really good, or maybe we just were really hungry?? :-) Those 2 meals with a bottled water came to $50 (19% gratuity included). We ordered room service for breakfast as well. 2 American breakfasts (scrambled eggs, bacon, 2 juices), 1 bottled water and another juice totaled $33 (19% gratuity included). On the way back from the Caribbean, we got a standard room. We asked for a King bed and non-smoking. We got that no problem. The bed in that room was AWFUL. Both my husband and I did not sleep well and our backs hurt in the morning. Also in this room, there was no separate sheet to cover ourselves, just a heavy comforter and we'd get hot after a while. Why would they not have a cover sheet is beyond me. We think it's an okay hotel for a one-night stay and on a Priceline win.

Every employee seemed well-versed in good customer service. The hotel shuttle to/from the airport runs every half hour. It would have been nice for the hotel website to mention that this runs regularly to avoid having to call on arrival. The Miami airport can be a zoo in the pickup/dropoff zone and it is helpful to know exactly where you should be (up on the 2nd level where the \"Departures\" come, NOT on the ground level for \"Pick-up\") and when to expect a shuttle. The staff was very helpful in locating the shuttle and providing an ETA when I called, though. The hotel public areas are lovely. The rooms seemed a bit more average, but very clean. The VERY fluffy down bed things are wonderful. Rooms have internet connections (wired, about $10 per day), and I believe I heard someone say there was wireless capability in at least some areas of the hotel (though the colleagues who said this were not having success in making this work, so unsure what the details are). Clearly heard the TV in the room next door (seemingly through the closed connecting door). No coffee in room. USA Today available in lobby. Late check-out was available on the date I was there with Sofitel guest membership (free, sign-up online). The restaurant on site is also lovely and food is prepared in a reasonable amount of time. Menu is not extensive, but seemd to include a decent variety. Approximate prices=sandwiches/hamburger around $12-14 with fries or salad, entrees more around $20, soups/salads around $8-10. More wines on the menu than food. Would be willing to stay here again for business if needed.

I had booked the hotel around 3 months in advance of our trip and was able to get it for $122 per night by booking thru their website. It was more than I wanted to pay, but was very happy with the hotel. It is too depressing for me to get off of a cruise ship (the most comfortable bed and pillows EVER) and end our vacation, so I know must stay one night post cruise. Little did I know that this hotel would make me feel like I was still on the ship!! We debarked around noon and we were to the hotel by 12:30 and checked in. The lobby was beautiful and the doorman/bellman very helpful. The room was gorgeous and shockingly, the bed was just as comfortable as the one we had just left on the ship. There is a telephone in the bathroom and the sound from the television is piped into the bathroom so you dont miss a moment of your favorite show, news or music. .You can hook up to the internet at the desk in room for $9.95. Being outside on the deck by the pool and the water was heaven as I sipped on a Mojito ($8)....I didnt even have sealegs as my body was still on ship time. Felt like I was still on vacation. Views very nice outside and there is also a garden-patio area. A couple of guys were fixing the \"crocodile fence\" on the other side of the pool near the ocean. Apparently part of the fence had come down during one of the hurricanes and they were closing it up the day we were there to keep the crocs out! We did not see any nearby or anywhere. Menu prices were high for food, but they had huge servings. They serve you a medley of olives and little baked cheese type crackers that are baked on premises. Grounds are very nice; hotel inside and outside is just stunning and pleasing to they eye. Staff friendly and helpful and they treat you sooo good. Only downside is that there is not anything nearby that you can walk to (like Bayside) but overall, it was a very pleasant stay. I may stay there again someday, but next time will look for a hotel that is closer to some action (restaurants, beaches etc) as I found $13 for a bagel, salmon and red onion a little too high priced for breakfast!! They do have a nice menu and although not on it, I heard the bartender take orders for chicken fingers and burgers (not on menu). My Mojito was made from scratch and was the best I have ever had....maybe not worth $8, but must have been good since I had ALMOST 2 1/2 drinks!! Our morning pot of coffee was almost $15 delivered to our room !! Granted it was beautifully presented, but worth that much?? It included gratuity, but we still gave the girl $2. So total was $17!!!

To summarize, I would NOT recommend planning a small event at this hotel, especially when there is a larger event occurring, the service level suffers. I have no complaints about the hotel or meeting rooms, only felt that the service was sub-standard. The rest of the review will focus on the service issues I experienced which led me to that conclusion. 1) Beginning with my arrival--no parking, had to valet park because ALL THE WAY AROUND this massive building there were no parking spaces. (I later learned that there is a shared parking garage, but the signage wasn't apparent to me from where I entered.) 2) I arrived before the posted check-in time and they were not able to give me a room (the front desk attendant had a \"so what\" attitude, which bothered me much more than waiting for a room to be ready!) I gave my luggage to the bellman and went to the hotel restaurant. When I returned at 3:00 (check-in time) they STILL had difficulty assigning me a room and again with the attitude(different front desk attendant, same attitude.) 3) When I asked about obtaining my luggage, I was told \"Oh, we don't have a bellman on duty.\" At check-in time?? When the hotel is clearly full of people? I had to go with a manager to the storage area, identify my own bags and \"borrow\" a luggage cart. 4)The next morning, our meeting was scheduled to start and we needed to make a last minute run across the freeway for computer speakers (A/V team only had full sound boards at a cost of $300+.) There was NO OTHER GUEST at the valet station and I asked if my car was nearby because I was in a hurry and would take a cab if that was the better option. The valet assured me, \"it's right around the corner, we'll be right back.\" 15 minutes later, my business associate pulls in (to attend the meeting) and we take HER car because the valet still hadn't returned with my car. 5) No signage directing attendees to our smaller meeting--a number of our participants commented on parking problems and difficulty finding the room. I'm sure the experience of larger groups is very different, but for a smaller meeting (20 people) we paid a premium for less than ideal service.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cWould return if required\u201d", "Author": "LivetoTravelNicely", "ReviewID": "UR126836989", "Content": "We recently completed a stay at the InterContinental Dallas for a convention+extended weekend visit. There were many features about this hotel that I liked, but in the end, there were several things that first brought it to a four rating, and then finally landing at the three rating that I have decided to bestow upon it. Comparing to its own hotel class (which is typically how we travel), I would rank it average, at best. Compared to all hotels, I might give it a four, but only because 3.5 or 3.75 aren't available options. The PROS: Staff were friendly and helpful each time Housekeeping was good Restaurant food was pretty good (this is the sit-down restaurant) Bed was comfortable; Sheets were 'ok' Good area of town, but at least a 5-10 minute walk to anything not at the hotel The CONS: Towels sucked...they were the tiny little white towels that I would expect at a motel. Further, they were very thin/worn and had multiple and noticable stains on them. Water pressure. I noticed this was mentioned in a recent post. It was \"manageable\" in the shower, but the toilet stool was kind of a problem. It took multiple flushes and it took a good 5 minutes for the tank to refill for the next flush. Outside entry doors next to the Starbucks. It had blue duct-tape on them covering some key holes. This is not acceptable for a classy hotel...get new doors. They can pay for them with the all of the profits from the Starbucks and gift shop. Cafe that sold Starbucks and gift shop. Way overpriced. I normally don't complain about prices because I know that hotels routinely up the price on everything. But, a small container of TUMS (8 tums in the roll) was $3.99 and a Snickers was $1.59, for example! Cafe that sold Starbucks. Old food. They had yogurt for sale that was 2 weeks over the expiration date. Not acceptable. This made me stay away from the sandwiches because if they are willing to sell two week past the date yogurt, how old are the sandwiches!? Channel selection on the TV sucked...that is unless you like Fox News and CNN or re-runs of old sitcoms. Besides local channels, you got Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, ESPN, TBS, TNT, and The Weather Channel. Also HBO. I'd rather have a broader selection of channels and no HBO. \"Free HBO\" is about a 20 year old marketing technique that worked, well about 20 years ago. Not such a hot amenity in 2012. (But that is a personal preference.) Air Conditioner wasn't keeping up, and we were there in March! I had the stupid thing on 65 but was sweating in bed on top of the covers. I didn't have a thermometer, but upon returning home, I had the A/C on 72 (and it is accurate) and I had to use a blanket...no sweating either at home....so it had to have been at least 78 or hotter in the room. General Thoughts: This hotel is a business hotel that caters to Conference Attendees. It is adequate for a few nights while at a conference. Further, if you are looking for a nice bed to sleep for a night or two and the other hotels in Dallas are full, I'd certainly stay at the InterContinental for that. Just remember my Pros, because they were absolutely Pros....great staff including housekeeping. Just an older building and a poorly run Coffee Shop.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cShows its age; awful toilet flush; Concierge gave wrong information\u201d", "Author": "snod73", "ReviewID": "UR126688121", "Content": "The property is located conveniently; Safe area; Rooms show their age; Pillows had nothing in them = neck pain Sheets gave us allergies.

So, you can imagine how many flushes were needed for one day!! The concierge lacks knowledge to provide recommendations for restaurants. He sent our group (of 8 people) to Chamberlain's fishmarket....when we clearly mentioned that 2 in our group were vegetarian. He swore that the restaurant had vegetarian dishes. Of course, the restaurant had nothing for the veggies and so the group split to two restaurants. No thanks to the concierge. This made for some very uncomfortable times during a big meeting. I would suggest that the concierge say \"I dont know\" if they dont know what they are talking about. Of course, our group was also to blame for listening to the concierge.

They would disappear out of sight leaving us with no service for long periods. It was as if the waiters were helping out in the kitchen??? Where else would they have gone? When the food eventually did come, it was cold. Had it been ready for some time just waiting for someone to bring it out? Will never eat there again.

After opening the ridiculously outdated heavy doors (for my wife, remember the valet guy has his hands full) we entered the lobby. Though the entrance to the hotel was not so great, the lobby looked fantastic. Clean, good ambiance, busy bar. Our check-in was simple; the gentleman was very professional and made us laugh and smile. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask about internet connection at the time, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get into that in a bit. There was a crowd at the elevator at which two or three elevators were broken. After about fifteen minutes of waiting, we arrived at our room; it was tidy and clean thought the hallways carpet leading to it were dirty and stained. My wife wanted to switch on her iPad and video call our daughter to let her know we have arrived safely. This is where the nightmare begins. Let me inform you that our stay was for three nights, October of 2011. Two-Thousand-Eleven. This hotel has no in-room wifi. In fact no free internet anywhere. The in-room charge was $10 for a day, but if you disconnect your computer or turn it off, guess what, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another ten dollars. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all wired, (Ethernet cable) ya know, the ones from the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and 90\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.. so no iPad connection at all. I was able to get my phone to use as a hotspot, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly convenient. Around dinner time we headed down to get some recommendations from the hotel concierge. Let me say this now, through out all the miseries of this outdated property, the concierge, Kural, was simply sunshine to my wife and I. He suggested amazing restaurants around the hotel every night of our stay and my wife spoke of him at our dinners excited to give him the feedback. He also made the arrangements for us to attend the State Fair. The State Fair was incredible, fun, and the food as well. Kural gave us information on how to get there using Dallas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bus and train system. From the hotel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 20 miles away, but round trip it was only $4. Talk about a man who knows how to find you a deal, this young man was just fantastic. We did eat breakfast once at the hotel, nothing special, but the service was good. We also sat down for drinks in the lounge / lobby. My wife and I waited for over 15 minutes to be served. We were surrounded by young people enjoying their night and drinks, but the waitress just seemed to ignore us and would rather chat with the other wait staff. After we were served our overflowing drinks we walked to the drive to use the hotel shuttle to Gloria's. We waited to be acknowledged staring at the same valet man hunched over his desk texting. The Shuttle is a great service, being hinted that we need to tip the driver (our texting friend) is not so classy. The shuttle was not so quick to pick us back up. When I questioned the driver he apologized and said the shuttle was being used to buy groceries for the gift shop. Groceries?! Are you kidding me? We were not the only ones delayed by a shopping run the hotel decided to do in the middle of what seemed to be a chaotic night for the shuttle. Talk about time management, I owned a restaurant in my days and all our food was delivered. And that was the 70's for god sakes. The day we departed our check out was quick and easy, no horrendous charges, and we like it that way. We did not utilize Room Service or have any problems with Housekeeping. We could have ended on a good note with just that, but no, this property cuts corners again. My wife and I ordered 2 cups of coffee from the Starbucks in the lobby, and paid for Starbucks coffee. I know coffee, I brew it now for a living. When I asked the cashier what it really was.. guess what, the house coffee is FOLGERS and they sell it as Starbucks. That is just plain embarrassing..", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "helenmarie166", "ReviewID": "UR119877579", "Content": "I was worried due to the negative reviews but I was very surprised at what a beautiful hotel this is and the excellent service we received from the staff.

The design, appearance and general look and feel of the interior is modern and appealing. It was a nice place to stay. But, as a business traveler, I think the ball is dropped in a few areas. 1) No Free WiFi. I travel a lot with my laptop and rarely have trouble connecting. At IC Dallas, the room connection for internet is not free, and it's a hard wired setup that you have to plug in. Mine didn't work. I spent 15 minutes on the phone with the support line. They told me to ask for a new cable cord. I did, Still didn't work. Finally, they replaced the power supply for the modem and that did the trick. Internet was fast and reliable thereafter for the duration. But that still left just a wired connection, so use of the laptop was restricted sitting at the desk and staying plugged in. That's ok for me, but if you like sitting in a chair or on the bed with your laptop, you'll not be able to do so. No free WiFi in the lobby either, I was told. This isn't important to everyone, but if you're like me, it is. I like to get out of the room sometimes, and get some work done in a less confined space and I appreciate having the option of grabbing a table in a coffee shop downstairs, or in the lobby area. Can't do that at IC. 2) Isolated location. Way up the freeway in Addison. There are a couple of chain restaurants within a 10 minute walk, but otherwise, during my stay in Dallas, I had to drive anywhere I wanted to go when not doing convention stuff in the hotel, and traffic sucked. I would not use this as a \"home base\" for an extended trip or vacation to Dallas visit but would instead find something downtown with walkable entertainment and dining options so you can leave the vehicle parked if you'd prefer. Those were my main two gripes. I didn't use room service, maid service or any of facilities other than the room, restaurant and convention happenings. The convention workshop rooms were too small. That's the fault of my organization for not planning better for the attendance, but the rooms were not expandable and we had overflow capacity. The lounge is a cool place to hang out with friends and relax. The breakfast buffet was ok, not spectacular, but good enough. If you are a Priority Club member, you'll get some perks. I was given free breakfast every morning, a $20 buffet each day, was was ok for free but I would not have paid $20 to eat there otherwise.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hanover, IN", "Title": "\u201cReally?\u201d", "Author": "David H", "ReviewID": "UR119676544", "Content": "One of the worst hotel experiences I have had in a long time!

First the building itself is an older building. They have updated the rooms so they were decorated nicely. However, the windows were filthy. All you saw was dirt when you looked outside. The pillows were too large and stiff. My neck hurt after sleeping on them. Also, bathroom hooks were missing (there were nail holes on the door and walls) and there was a strange odor to the rooms and hallways. The lobby area was nice but also looked out-dated despite some of the renovations. They did have a very nice, relaxing lobby bar however the service was nonexistent. Twice we tried to order drinks/food from the waitress. Each time she said she'd be right back. Half an hour later, we ended up having to get up and order directly from the bar. The waitress never did come by our table. The pool was nothing spectacular. I've seen nicer pools in people's backyards. I know some people commented otherwise but I received some of the worst service I've ever had at this hotel. First, someone had left us a package at the front desk. We were willing to go pick it up but the person at the front desk nicely assured us that they would be able to deliver it to our room. An hour later, no package. When we called, they just rudely said they'll get it to us when they can. Later when we were checking out, we asked for a bellhop to send a cart since we had a lot of luggage. Again, nearly half an hour later (and with a plane to catch), there was still no bellhop or cart. We ended up lugging everything (with an infant child) by ourselves. Then as we are loading everything in our car, we were struggling a bit with all of our luggage and were taking several minutes longer than usual for loading. One of the staff rudely came to us and said this area was for loading/unloading only as my husband was actively trying to get a suitcase into the trunk. There were no other cars there and no cars were waiting for our spot so we didn't know what the issue was. We pointed and said we are loading and she only replied, please hurry. She didn't even bother to offer assistance. We stayed at this hotel because of a wedding held there.

A good health club should always have excellent ventilation, but this was subpar. Also, there was no drinking water anywhere. There was an empty water bottle fridge, and trying to find a water fountain or a bottle of water took some effort. The check-in counter apologized and said they would have housekeeping refill the water bottles, but the next day the mini fridge was missing altogether and I had to again go through some hoops to find drinking water during my 45 minute workout. So service wasn't quite up to par for what I expect in a 4-star establishment. (2) Internet is still wired. I understand Wifi is in the works, but for a 4-star establishment that is primarily a business hotel, this should've happened years ago. (3) For some reason the air seemed quite humid throughout the hotel, especially in our hotel room, and even with the A/C on full blast. The A/C did work and the room did cool off, but there was always a \"damp\" feeling that gave the air a stuffy feel. If I was staying there any longer I'd feel the need to purchase a dehumidifier.

Another mom and I were in the lobby waiting for our team to return from a game and we had two coolers with us to pass out Gatorade and water to our team. Nabila saw us there and told us we can't stand in the lobby as there were two weddings coming. I explained what we were doing and she said we cannot be there, we had to move.

It was a decent experience. We mostly travel and stay in 5 star hotels but we were only in town 3 nights/4 days before heading to Lake Tahoe and San Francisco for vacation. We mainly came to go shopping and had a successful trip. We flew all night from Buenos Aires, Argentina where we lived and our flight got in very early. Fortunately they allowed us to enter one of the 2 suites that we booked. We booked 2 adjoining rooms so our young kids could sleep in there and it worked out perfectly. We were on the 8th floor and it was very quiet and we had a decent view. The basics: Valet parking is $18 and you can come and go as often as you want. I always tipped the valet guys a few bucks each time they got the car. They were very courteous and prompt in bringing my car. I called down each time before and it was always ready. Check-in was fast and courteous. I appreciated that even though both of our rooms weren't ready so early in the morning the check-in agent allowed us to enter one of the rooms as we flew 12 hours and didn't sleep on the plane. The rooms are decent. The only thing we really didn't like were the pillows which we found uncomfortable. The TV's are old and not nicer LCD tvs. Only one of the 2 rooms internet was working. They have a router that you plug in and one of them took some messing around with but worked. A real bargain at $10 a day and it's very fast. There are 6 fast elevators in the lobby so there is always one ready to go up to the rooms. We selected this hotel because of the location. Our main purpose was to do a lot of shopping so we were very close to the Galleria shopping mall, Stonebriar Mall in Frisco and our favorite Northpark was just a quick zip down the Tollway. They brought up a crib that we requested immediately after check-in and everyone was friendly. We didn't eat in the hotel at all nor get room service here as we were so busy and out and about.

While the bathroom did leave a bit to be desired, the rest of the room was great--modern, clean and recently refurbished. Flat-panel TV, nice furniture. The bed was very comfortable. The internet was speedy and affordable ($9.95/day, when I'm used to paying sometimes double at other 'premium' hotels). The executive lounge had great evening snacks, albeit a small spread, but delicious hot appetizers, cheeses, fruits and veggies plus beer and wine. Breakfast was typical continental...But not bad for a no-cost upgrade at check-in. What set the Intercontinental above the rest was the staff...Everyone was so helpful and friendly. The concierge made a great dinner suggestion (Chamberlain's Seafood Market)...Great dining experience. The hotel offers a free shuttle ANYWHERE within a 3-mile radius, but I swear our restaurant the second night was further than that. We had 2 different drivers during our stay and both were SUPER guys--friendly, helpful and prompt on the pick-up after we finished at the restaurant...One night they even stopped at a bank for me to hit an ATM. I tipped them very well. The evening doorman (older gentleman) was super nice and helpful. The hotel is in a phenomenal location--tons of restaurants and shopping nearby, the shuttle isn't even necessary for some places. Our only meal in the hotel was lunch in the main restaurant, called Monte Carlo...It was pretty good. Service was good, food was fair, price was okay--not a great value, but again, not bad for a hotel. We'll definitely look at this place again when returning to Dallas.

If free parking is full, consider springing for the $18 valet because the garage isn't come-and-go. If you leave even one time during the day, the valet option just paid for itself.

I was also skeptical because I have read in the past that priceline's customers may get the crappy rooms in a hotel, but this was quite the opposite. I will start from the beginning: 1. Parking- Outside parking was not a big deal for us. We always seemed to find a spot. Even though we may have had to drive around once or twice. There is garage parking available but it costs either $10 or $15 so I did the free parking 2. Lobby- Usual 4 star lobby with all the marble and granite. Very nice but the ballrooms were showing its age a little bit. 3.Elevators-Kinda small for such a big hotel and some of them smelled like feet. Good thing it was a short ride! On the plus side, there was a lot of elevators so the wait time was very short if any wait time at all. 4. Room- Very clean and adequately equipped for business and pleasure. The one thing that ticks me off with these 4 star hotels are the TV's. The room would be so much nicer with a 32\" LCD instead of the customary 27\" bubble screen. We stayed on the 12th floor so at night the city was lit and it was kinda nice. There was also a minibar, but beware...the prices are downright crazy! they have regular size kit-kats for $2.50. The beds were also kinda hard...usually hotel beds should be plush....but it was okay. Room service was great! We had pizza and tortilla soup. The food was excellent but the prices were ridiculous!. It was $28! They add in their own 15% gratutity. Also if you look online, the rooms look the exact way so it was good there were no surprises. 5.Bathroom- Kinda small but had nice counter space. The shower head was kinda weak, but it still did its job. 6. Area attractions-Was near to all types of restaurants and shopping, movie theatre etc..only a five minute drive. Overall I would give this hotel a 3.5. They would get a 4 if the beds were softer and they had better tv's. I checked online and the regular rate is $199. I think that they are stretching it a lot.

Overall, not the service and quality I normally get at Intercontinental Hotels. You can get some cheap rates here, but there is a reason.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenixville, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice safe business hotel\u201d", "Author": "tsl1965", "ReviewID": "UR6650504", "Content": "I stayed here for a business meeting. I have no idea about the location, except that it was about $45 by taxi to the airport. This is a very nice business hotel. My room was large and comfortable, and the bed was as nice as anything else I have slept on in similar hotels. The decor was blandly modern - not my taste - it was pretty ugly. I arrived late in pouring rain and was forced to use room service. To my pleasant surprise, the $10 burger was amazing - 12 oz, cooked really well, with great fries and all the condiments. Probably the best and fairest priced hotel meal I have ever had. Also, there is free internet in the lobby to check your return flight - a nice touch, since most hotels in this range ask $10 for the same privilege. In all, a nice pleasant business hotel, with adequate meeting facilites.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "stainged04", "ReviewID": "UR6605940", "Content": "My wife and I are local to the area, and decided to stay at this hotel for a romantic evening on the town. I was able to book through Priceline, and received an excellent rate of $69 for a Saturday night. Our room was ready upon out arrival at around 2:30 PM, and we were able to upgrade to one of the newly renovated rooms without any additional charge. I was very pleased with the room. It looked pretty much exactly like the photos on the Intercontinental website. The bed was very comfortable, and had plenty of pillows. All other in-room amenities were pretty much as advertised. I do have a couple of small negatives to note about the room. First, there was no hair dryer which I found to be a little strange. However, one was promptly brought to us upon contacting the front desk. Second, there was not an in room safe which I have become rather accustomed to in this grade of lodging. Other than that we had a very pleasant stay. They have a great gym which includes cardio, machines, free weights, and racket ball courts. The pool and hot tub (outdoor) are available, but we didn't venture out since it was about 30 degrees. Free parking was sufficient on the weekend, but might become crowded during the week. The parking structure is $10 with no in and out. We were not able to try the Brunch, but understand from other guests that it is very nice. I would gladly stay at this hotel again......especially if I could get a repeat of the great rate.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNot a Bad Choice But Read Carefully\u201d", "Author": "Profotog", "ReviewID": "UR6055735", "Content": "This is a nice hotel staffed by very nice people. It is typical of a hotel geared for the conference business. The upgraded rooms are nice and mine was carefully cleaned every day. The bed is fairly comfortable and there is a good, big working desk. There is wired internet in the room (charge) but you must pay separately for wireless in the common areas and this wireless won't work in the room. Parking is a mess. The only parking dedicated to the hotel is the valet parking which is $12.50 per day for guests and very limited.. The lots surrounding the hotel are public parking and fill during the day with workers from neighboring buildings. If you use their parking garage (also public and frequently filled) it costs $5.00 every time you move your car. You must feed $5.00 bills into a machine to get your car out. It is unattended so don't forget change. Very inconvenient. The room-service prices are absurd as in all hotels now. Their restaurant is expensive (hamburger over $10.00 on the lunch menu) but decent for hotel food. Expect a very expensive dinner there. There are so many good restaurants in the area that this is not a problem. You can walk to any number. The rooms can be cold (which I absolutely love) but the individual heater in my room worked like a champ. One wierd comment. This hotel had the best and fastest elevators I have ever seen. Though the hotel seemed to be full I never waited for an elevator for more than a few seconds and I was on the 12th floor. Do not expect a five star experience here. It is a good utilitarian hotel with excellent conference facilities and a very nice staff. I paid $100.00 per day with a conference which is about average. If you are a business traveler you will find better values with more perks in the area. If you are visiting the neighboring office buildings this might be a good choice. If you are looking for a good place for a conference this might be the one. Their conference staff was as good as I have ever seen. Just make sure your folks can find a place to park. I spent 6 days at the hotel and was comfortable. If not for parking and the food prices I would have rated it above average.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "InterContinental Dallas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109412-Reviews-InterContinental_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$133 - $222*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">15201 Dallas Parkway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75001</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "109412", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b7/73/b4/premier-guestroom.jpg"}}

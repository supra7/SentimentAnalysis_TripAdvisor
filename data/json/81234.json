The second time (April 2012) we stayed in the main \"Historical\" building. The room in the H building was very nice. It had a gorgeous spacious layout, hardwood floors, a very nice king size bed, a fireplace, a claw tub and a huge walk-in shower big enough for two people. My only complaint with the historical room was the noise. The walls were very thin and unfortunately we could hear our neighbors in room 204...the bed was squeaking if you know what I mean! 2 nights in a row we had to knock on the bathroom wall. We could also hear cars and trucks driving by from our little window. Otherwise the hotel is very nice and the people at the front desk were always nice and accommodating.

The breakfasts from Sweetie Pie's were delightful with a nice selection to choose from, and both mornings they were delivered on time by a very friendly and gracious staff member. My only disappointment was with the yogurt parfait which I ordered on the side. The yogurt was standard Greek yogurt and the granola had very little sweetness, making it a rather bland and very tart parfait. But all of our other choices were well prepared and tasty. We were able to walk to the downtown Napa areas where we enjoyed meals at Norman Rose Tavern and Ristorante Allegria. It was nice to feel vitality from some segments of the downtown area as Napa continues to build on their renaissance and restoration. It would be nice to have more shops open, but the lovely wine and craft fair on Saturday was a pure delight! I found several treasures on Saturday and everyone was very pleasant and helpful.

The A/C unit was positioned 17\" from the head of the bed, good luck sleeping in those conditions! In order to use the bathroom, you had to open doors that prevented your spouse from using the sink. The pillows were flat and I suspect purchased on low bid with no regard to quality. The window blinds required multiple efforts just to raise and lower them, one was broken. Lets talk food. They had a nice little bakery that served 4-5 choices for breakfast. The quality of the food was at best very average.

I first set up a time to go around my birthday but at the last minute had to change plans. The phone call to the hotel followed and spoke to reservations. They were easy to work with in changing the date and took the offer at the time to upgrade to a larger room with a great view of the river. Since I needed to bring along a four legged furry friend to stay during the visit I called back to the hotel to get some information on Pet Sitters. Spoke to Linda the conceirge who quickly answered my questions about pet sitters. I gave her the information that I was looking for and the budget and she quickly took care of setting up the pet sitter so that a great night out for dinner could be enjoyed. En-route hotel was the trip from hell. Two accidents on the way. One was a major detour as Hiway 12 was closed. I again called the hotel and Linda again took great care to help me rearrange a massage appointment that was pending. I will tell you that the people at Le Pelle Spa were fantastic. Not only did the honor the stay open late to accomidate our late arrival but they honored the whole 90 minute session. Thank you very much to the staff at Le Pelle. Linda also was great in working with us on arranging that late arrival for the massage. I have never seen in all my years going to Napa seen a person go out of her way to help arrange for a late arrival. Check in was great. Heather had everything ready to go and took care of getting someone to help me with my bags to the room. Mathew found me as I was out walking the dog and worked with me while the last bit of business was taken care of. The room #215 was a corner room. Nice view of the river the only knock is the plants growing on the balcony make it hard for two people to sit out on the small patio. Also the doors to the patio need to have a way to keep them open easier. Wedging a chair was not the ideal method to do that. Bathroom was spacious and the separate tub and shower are spacious. The pet sitter went off without a hitch and a short walk up the street to Fish Story was fantastic. The next morning the breakfast arrived at the set time on the dot. The only knock was the coffee was cold. I would think a single carafe of coffee would have been nicer but hey I can not complain about free food showing up in the room on the dot. If you are traveling with a four legged friend the steps that the Inn went through for them was fantastic. The bowls that were there were perfect the spill mat great and the doggie blanket was fantastic. Even the bag of treats was great too. The pet sitter that was set up for by Linda was fantastic. Bekka arrived on time and took great care of our pet for the three hours we were gone. Great job. Lastly check out was smooth and simple. The Inn is close to downtown and some great restaurants.

It was fresh, delicious, and delivered on time! I can't say enough good things about our experience. From the sweet smells of the fresh flowers outside off our balcony to the evening stroll along the riverwalk, the great comfortable room to the fantastic meals and super attentive staff members - a memorable birthday experience for years to come!!! I will have my work cut out for me trying to top this birthday next year.

The modern annex is of the soul-less variety, the decor remains characterless despite being overblown (impossibly high narrow beds, heavily wooden furniture taking up much needed space, floral curtains), and the carpets looked worn - there is nothing 'boutique' about most of the accommodation in this hotel and it is misleading that it calls itself a boutique hotel. There are no staff in the annex and I worried about security - although the door to it requires a room key to enter, it was left propped open during part of the day. Our room was small (far smaller than rooms of the same price that we stayed in elsewhere in San Francisco), had no view, and the 'balcony' could hold one person standing only. We rang reception when we got to the room to ask whether the beds were in fact single beds because they were so small and were told they were not single and not queen and so yes they were double beds. My husband and I slept badly here, there was literally no room to turn over. We had breakfast both days but you are required to have it in your room, an odd arrangement given that there is no table, just a narrow desk, and not enough chairs. The 'workout' room is just the size of a small hotel room itself and has two or three treadmills etc in it and was overly warm when we were there.

We had one night to spend and were looking for something a little different than a downtown Berkeley hotel or a night in SF (which, admittedly, would also have been nice). We found a terrific deal online for the Napa River Inn, did the math on the drive to Cal from Napa (not bad at all - 35 minutes), and made what turned out to be a great decision to stay at the Napa River Inn. After lunch at the Oxbow Market and a quick walk down First Street and up Main to get our bearings, we checked in a little early at the Inn. No problem. Our guest relations representative was a lovely person and helped explain the Historic Napa Mill complex of which the Napa River Inn is a part, and its amenities. We were given a second floor Deluxe Embarcadero room, which came with a balcony, fireplace, comfy king bed, large bathroom, Keurig coffee maker, flat panel tv, in other words - the works. The balcony overlooked the lazy flow of the Napa River and the train station across the river. The Embarcadero Building, as well as the Hatt Building, are a seamless mix of turn of the century charm with modern amenities, with clean and posh decor and fixtures. We've seen the concept tried in many places elsewhere, but rarely if ever so successfully. Especially since the southern tip of Main Street is full of new, upscale buildings and establishments, e.g., Morimoto Napa, Tyler Florence, it's impressive that the Napa River Inn has been able to maintain the overall Old World feel for the complex. Given our limited timing, we had decided to limit ourselves to one wine tasting before dinner. We had a great time at the Vintner's Collective on Main and Clinton, and then made our way back to dinner at Angele, which is located in the old boathouse in between the Hatt Building and the Embarcadero Building. Dinner on the patio overlooked the river and was covered by the gift certificate we had received as part of the mid-week special package. The next morning, we were served our 'breakfast in bed' from Sweeties, which also was complimentary. We actually ate out on the balcony, and were treated to some colorful hot air balloons taking off across the river.

We were from Japan and did not have any ideas about how far the each location is from the hotel. As a result we walked to the Napa Outlet Mall and took us more than 30 min. As you can imagine, we were too tired to go back again so we requested a support to the hotel and they actually sent us a car to pick us up (was free of charge). It was great and saved our night there! Front desk and Concierge, they all were friendly and very helpful. I had organized the wine tour on the second day through them and it was great. The tour took us to private Wineries around Napa and had great time. I mean you can spend more cash for high end hotels but I think Napa River Inn is the place to stay if you want to enjoy your time at Napa and make the most out of it!", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Inn\u201d", "Author": "Chitownboy", "ReviewID": "UR106987502", "Content": "The Napa River Inn was one of the best places we have stayed.

After reserving the room, I received a welcome email and another one shortly after, asking if we needed help making a reservation for dinner. My fiancee and I checked in on a Thursday night - the lobby was completely charming, and the front desk staff welcomed us with a smile. She gave us all the information we needed (as well as our dining gift certificate) and offered to help with anything we needed while we were at the hotel. Parking was plentiful and nearby. Our room was on the second floor... and it was pretty grand. Huge room, great red walls and an inviting king bed. Had a sitting area with a gas fireplace with a large flat screen TV above. The bathroom was just as generous... with a claw foot tub, bathrobes, large vanity, great toiletries, and a two person shower! We headed over to Morimoto Napa, where we had a reservation waiting. Great drinks and appetizers! The included breakfast delivery from Sweetie Pie's next door from the hotel in the morning was fabulous.

Hearing that he viewed his life as near perfect, getting to ride his bike to work everyday, drink great wine, and listen to live music, it was difficult to argue otherwise. On our second night after disembarking the wine train and walking back to the Inn and past Silo's, the owner saw us, and ushered us into Silo's, ushered us to a table, and told us to enjoy the music never mentioning the cover charge and even telling us to \"never mind' the two item/drink minimum.

The one small window let in just a bit of light, so the room remained fairly dark throughout the day--but I appreciated the fact that the original windows were retained in this historic bldg.

The very spacious tiled bath had a slipper tub for soaking and a BIG walk-in shower with 2 shower heads and fold-down seat (the room was handicapped accessible). The only \"complaints/suggestions\" would be to add towel racks since there were few places to hang our towels, and to include a small table in the room where we could eat breakfast.

Also, my cup of coffee wasn't very hot when it arrived (an individual carafe would keep it hot), and my breakfast sandwich was a bit soggy.

The \"river\" is only a river at night when the tides come in, otherwise during the day it is simply a mud hole with no water in it at all. Really. The cafe is of course noisy during the morning and at other times, so you cannot enjoy the miniscule balcony at any time. Other rooms also overlook the restaurent located adjacent to the hotel, which is a great restaurent but not meant to be looked on from your hotel room.

As always from past experience, the room was immaculate. Everything was just so. One of my favorite parts of staying at Napa River Inn is the breakfast that is brought up to your room each morning. The breakfast is included and is prepared by Sweetie Pies Bakery which is in the same building. You get a pastry, choice between a breakfast sandwich, granola parfait or the quiche du jour, and you also get freshly squeezed juice or fresh fruit. You just tell them what time to bring it and they bring it right up. And it's all included in your room fees! The location is great too, it's right on the Riverfront and walking distance to downtown restaurants like ZuZu, Downtown Joe's. Morimoto Napa, etc. This is the only place that I will stay in Napa.

A second level room would provide at least more privacy although I would guess you can still hear the conversations outside - and those rooms cost another $50 for the priviledge. On the plus side, the bed was terrific with nice quality bedding, the room was very clean and had all the amenities you might need including bottles of water so great care was given to making sure guest are comfortable. The service at the front desk was friendly and efficient. The bakery next door provided great baked goods for the breakfast that comes with the room. We chose to stay at this hotel because it was located near downtown Napa, thinking we would like to take advantage of walking to stores and restaurants however Napa seems to be going through a downturn and many stores were empty and there really wasn't much to see. So as long as you know what you are getting into by choosing this location, it's a nice hotel and you might opt to pay more for a room to get a quieter and more private location.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cComfort and Elegance in the wine country\u201d", "Author": "Phineas55", "ReviewID": "UR64499191", "Content": "We booked a room in the historic building: king bed, fireplace, large bath with footed tub.

Although part of me like to experience the \"historic\" side of this hotel, I was also worried it would be old` smelly.... and my allergy would be so bad that's gonna ruin the trip. Not to mention, later on, I found out ppl were saying 2 rooms in this hotel were haunted.... @.@ But it has received so many good reviews, and I've never stayed in a \"haunted\" hotel before..... I decided to give it a try, and made a last minute reservation -- the night before our trip to Napa. And I am glad we stayed in Napa River Inn, the experience was great! Although the check-in time is 4pm, we were able to check in to our room when we arrived the hotel shortly after 2pm, and we were automatically upgraded from standard room to executive room with a king size bed, that's just perfect for me & my 6Y & 4Y kids. The front desk staff was very nice & detailed. Our room was at the corner of the 2nd floor at Embarcadero building. The room was roomy enough for my 2 girls to play in the room. One thing I especially love about Napa River Inn was we were able to leave the window opened during the stay to enjoy the fresh cool breeze in the room. Although the drawback of that was also hearing the noise of loud music from the drive-by cars... and the clinking sound from pushing the cart w/ glass bottles... that's probably from the hotel restaurant .... Luckily these noises quiet down quickly around 9 or 10pm without disturbing our sleep. The location of this hotel is another plus. The reason I wanted to stay in downtown Napa was so that I could experience the place by walking, but wouldn't tire my 2 young kids too much. There was a riverfront trail just behind Napa river inn, the girls loved walking up & down the stairs, and going thru the \"tunnels\"..... and seeing the 2 ducks/geese (I couldn't remember) near the hotel's restaurant patio. With being so concerned about the pet odor in the room prior to our stay.... I found myself over worried.... The reason I didn't give a 5 stars is the location of the a/c in the room -- yes, I am picky. Although we did not use it at all, thanks to the window & the spring breeze in April, I didn't like it's right next to the bed..... imagine I had to turn it on if staying during hot summer or cold winter... the air from the a/c would almost directly blow on my head when laying down on the bed.... it's just not a comfortable feeling.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N J", "Title": "\u201cnice\u201d", "Author": "EstelleNJ", "ReviewID": "UR61112357", "Content": "Your staff is wonderful - you should give them all a raise!

Second, it's a very nice hotel that's stumbling distance from many restaurants in downtown Napa -- an important consideration after a long day of wine tasting. PROS Spend the extra few bucks to upgrade from their standard room and you'll get a fireplace, balcony, or both. Their rooms are very comfortable and well-appointed. The best part is the included breakfast from Sweetie Pies Bakery (delivery to your room included) and the nightly wine tasting coupons! We opt to go out to Sweetie Pies (it's in the complex) because locals stop in there, so it's a great place to meet a few people and get the local scoop. And, Silo's Wine and Jazz club is outstanding! Keith, the manager, is always happy to make a winery recommendation so you just might find yourself modifying your wine tasting plans for the next day! CONS The room decor is a bit dated for our taste. Of course, it's all in good condition and they've recently upgraded the bedding, so it's not bad.

The parking was free and they give you a ticket to pop in the front of your vehicle window with your departure date on. With a cafe and nice restuarant on your doorstep it was a great place to stay. We walked 5mins down the road to a bar called 'Downtown Joes' which was a great bar, very welcoming and friendly. When we arrived on Friday we had no plans for a guided wine tour and were going to attempt it to do it ourselves. We went down to concierge and spoke with the friendly lady on the desk, we ended up booking a next day limo tour with Beau wine tours $125pp. It was such a great recommendation. We enjoyed it sooo much. And would recommend it to anyone else. Our driver Gary was a brilliant chap and knew everything about wines, without making you feel stupid.

The Napa River Inn was the first of three hotels that we stayed in during our five nights in wine country, and we left wishing we had spent the whole week there! We selected it for the first two nights of our trip because of great proximity to the vineyards, and many downtown locations as well. The rate ($224 when I booked) was also incredibly reasonable for the area (a not-so-pleasant surprise when we started looking!) But this hotel was worth every penny. There is construction going on next door, which we were wary of at first but turned out not to be a big deal. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The bathroom featured a separate tub and tiled shower that I could have spent all day in. There was also a great coffee maker- one of those Keurig (sp?) ones that make coffee from the individual pods- which was AWESOME. We're big coffee drinkers so we really appreciated not having to buy great coffee each morning, and the hotel thoughtfully provided both mugs and to-go cups with lids. The breakfast in bed was fantastic! A choice of quiche or breakfast sandwhich with fruit and a choice of pastry- more than enough food and all excellent. The second morning, the man who brought it thoughtfully suggest we eat outside on the patio since we didn't have a balcony and there was no one there, and we enjoyed an awesome breakfast on the river. The staff was awesome. The recommendations of the staff were spot-on; I asked for a \"cheap burger place\" for dinner the one night after splurging at Celadon (which is amazing, by the way!), and was directed down the road to Taylor's Refresher for fantastic burgers and milkshakes! They included a coupon for a free wine tasting for two at the Bountry Hunter which was also a nice touch. In all, we had an awesome stay, and we ended up getting a great rate to boot- I noticed the week before I left that the rate on the website had dropped (to $189).

We made our way up to the room (Room 205) and on the way noticed how victorian the hotel seemed. Everything was plush, and red, and stunning! we entered our room to find a tiny window overlooking a construction site, the fireplace didnt work but the bathroom was beautiful! we called down to the front desk and were told that there were no other rooms available but they would send someone immediatley to fix the fireplace. We then left to visit some wineries. Upon returning to the hotel, we took a quick shower and relaxed with the champagne that was part of the romance package. it was then things got scary. we felt like something was watching us. we looked around the room and noticed a picture of a young girl overlooking the bed. she had powerful eyes that watched you wherever you would go. her hand was up to her mouth almost like she was saying \"shhhh\". we tried to ignore it but there was a very weird aura in the room. i started to feel very uncomfortable so told my boyfriend to take down the painting and put it in the hallway. he did but even then we both couldnt shake this terrifying feeling. 45 minutes we checked out of the hotel. Feeling badly and a little foolish we went down to the lobby and told the front desk that we were checking out. we told the girl that we felt really stupid but we felt weird in the room - like there was something else there...thats when she casually said \"yeah, its haunted\". she went on to tell us about how the hotel is haunted and some of the stories that she had heard. although it was shocking to hear, it made me feel better that i wasn't crazy! She refunded our room (full cost) and we left.

The pictures of the rooms on the hotel web site looked a little fussy and claustrophobic, but our room was very nicely designed and included a fireplace, a sitting area and a balcony overlooking the Napa River. We booked it on their site as part of their \"mustard package,\" which was $270 a night and included coupons for things like 10% discounts at the General Store and Sweetie Pies, coupons to a wine tasting, etc. The free breakfast was nice! They give you a room service tag to hang on your door by midnight, and in addition to pastries and things you can order things like a bacon/egg sandwich. This hotel worked out perfectly for us, and we'd stay again if we had plans in Napa. I wouldn't, however, consider this a \"destination,\" hotel--in other words I wouldn't drive up to Napa just to stay there for the weekend. Although the staff and hotel itself are nice, the immediate area is not what I would call 'scenic.' As others mentioned, there's a lot of construction going on, and although it was nice to have a balcony, the view of the Napa river from the hotel with a busy highway beyond and industrial buildings is not exactly breathtaking. Also, when we arrived we went out to our balcony to have a drink before going to dinner, there was a group of what appeared to be homeless men sitting on the ground below us on the river bank drinking liquor from brown bags and being pretty loud.

We don't splurge much on hotels, but for us, this was a step up. It's easy to see that the hotel itself has gone through a major renovation recently. There is definitely a bit of a quaint, intimate feeling about the hotel, but I would not call it a \"bed and breakfast\" feel, which I read about on another posting on this site. Our room had an HD TV on the wall, a fireplace, a towel warmer and was plenty big for the two of us. The parking lot was big enough (we never had to troll around for a spot) and the staff was very nice. Even though it was Labor Day weekend and the hotel was nearly full, we didn't hear any noise from other rooms. If you get a package with the breakfast in the morning, it is well worth it! Sweetie Pie's food was fantastic and they gave us more than enough to keep us full through most of the day. (We'd eat a small lunch and then have a big dinner.) While I'm on the subject of dinner, there are a lot of options from the hotel right within walking distance. (This was important to us as we didn't want to have to drive back after splitting a bottle of wine at dinner or going out afterwards.) We walked to a different restaurant each night and stopped by a few pubs/bars on the way back. (Our favorite dinner by far was a local Italian restaurant called Uva.) It's an extremely safe area and a quick walk to any number of great restaurants. Here is the only downside that kept the Napa River Inn from an \"excellent\" rating. There is construction all around the property that no one had told us about. This doesn't really hamper the experience in the rooms or restaurants at night, but in the morning, the crews get going and are quite loud. The \"river view\" is not as romantic or charming as it could have been and our balcony was a bit loud and dustry for hanging out there much. I think the construction is scheduled to be finished sometime in late 2008 or 2009, so it's going to be a hinderance for awhile at least. If you're considering a trip to Napa in the near future, I would still recommend the Napa River Inn. The construction didn't deter too much from the experience and the hotel is really centralized to a lot of what's going on at night.

After being very dissatisfied with our room, we were upgraded at no charge. The room was a little larger (not much) and had a fireplace, balcony and river view. Still, not that impressive considering the price and that it was an upgraded room! Not to mention, there was construction all along the river and it was not in good shape! Also, very thin walls made it a little noisy. I would probably stay here again because of the location and convenience, but the room was just average.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "boise, ID", "Title": "\u201cAsk more questions\u201d", "Author": "cjulie", "ReviewID": "UR7435269", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Inn on a trip to the wine country.

My room had a small balcony, fireplace and river view. I was very happy w/the view, but it wasn't anything special (river isn't too pretty). My brother-in-law got upgraded to the Cpt. Hatt Suite, which was very nice. We would've had it, but I figured he was turning 40, so they could have it - and they loved it. I did hear one couple complain of construction noise (I never heard). They are building a very neat riverwalk type area around the hotel. It should be wonderful in a year or two. I'm sure the noise will get rather bad for some of the rooms. Before the trip I contacted concierge w/a few questions. The were promptly answered, along with some dinner reservations made and some winery suggestions. Celadon is in the hotel and the food was fair. Restaurante Allegrio (sp?) was nearby and was wonderful! As for wineries, we did the Jarvis tour (the grapes go into their cave/winery and don't come out until they are ready to sell as wine) which was pretty neat. You need reservations ($30). We also did Frog's Leap, which was a free tour. This was more fun - not for the serious type. Wine was ok, tour was somewhat informative, but they have a great winery and tour that also includes picking from their garden and how they try to be organic (but not totally). Our final tour was at Pine Ridge. Our favorite! Joined their club. Going online to buy more today. Joe led us on a very informative tour. Loved everything about this one ($20 tour/tasting). Finally, we stopped in Elizabeth Spencer (small brick place near the Rutherford Grill) because 29 was going so slow around 5:15. We were very impressed w/their wines. There wasn't one we didn't like.

There was a coffee maker with coffee and tea service provided, along with 2 bottles of water provided each day in the mini fridge in the armoire. The bathroom was well supplied with towels and toiletries. We weren't thrilled with the showerhead - it was the type used to conserve water and the spray seemed to be more air than water. It was, however, adequate. Parking was plentiful and it was a short walk into the center of town. We paid $225 a night, which included a scrumptious breakfast at Sweetie Pies bakery just downstairs. You could order breakfast to your room, but we preferred to meet our friends at the bakery, which seemed to be quite a gathering place for locals each morning. By going to the bakery, we had a larger selection of baked goods and could choose from a variety of coffees and teas that would not have been available through the room service. We all agreed that the portions were huge! Choices included an egg and ham or bacon croissant or bagel, fresh OJ, a tasty selection of baked goods (the Ana rolls and the scones were delicious) and coffee or tea as well as fresh fruit or a yogurt and granola parfait. Both days we ended up bagging the baked goods and snacking on them as we traveled throughout the beautiful Napa Valley visiting various winieries. One evening we dined at Celadon, one of the restaurants in the Napa Mill complex. We stopped by during the afternoon to request a table on their patio for dinner and had a most enjoyable light meal. As the evening was cool, there were heat lamp poles and a beautiful fireplace on the patio for our comfort. We had been lucky enough to reserve a table at the French Laundry our second evening and decided that we would like to engage a car and driver for the trip to Yountville (all the better to enjoy ourselves!) A gentleman at the front desk we spoke with made the arrangements for us, but, unfortunately,there must have been a miscommunication and no car was ordered. Instead, the bellman drove us to the restaurant in the hotel town car. He was a bit confused about the restaurant's location and because we were a bit late, the hotel didn't charge us for the trip. When we were finished with dinner, the hotel sent a cab service, again a town car, for which we paid $40, including tip. I researched many accomodations in the Napa Valley for this trip.

Boy were we surprised! The beds were so comfortable, the rooms had character, bathrobes hanging in the gorgeous marble-tiled bathrooms, and the most amazing complimentary breakfast I've ever had. Just to give you a feel: The breakfast was catered by Sweetie Pies, a local bakery/coffee shop downstairs (which has also received some good reviews on this site). The breakfast included a choice of juices, a choice of bagel or croissant sandwiches, and a choice of scones/rolls/danishes. Each person in the room got to make their own selections, and the breakfast was promptly delivered at whatever time you select. I had never seen anything like it. Absolutely amazing. Such a nice way to end our stay in Napa. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was right along the river. All the restaurants were within walking distance to the hotel. All around, this was a great experience. I highly recommend it and plan on staying there again the next time I'm in Napa.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFabulous...Sweetie Pies Fantastic Bonus!\u201d", "Author": "AmyTampa_Florida", "ReviewID": "UR3536337", "Content": "My husband and I took a four day trip to CA to celebrate our anniversary.

At first, we were alittle unsure about the breakfast in bed, when you fill out the breakfast card, it doesn't make it sound like anything special, but when breakfast arrived from Sweetie Pies, on a wicker tray, we were more than pleasantly suprised. The croissant egg sandwich, pasteries, and yogurt, granola and fruit cup were all out of this world! A great way to start before a day filled with wine tastings! Our room was very spacious and comfortable, we had a lovely balcony over looking the Napa River, and althought the river isn't much the views behind it of the rolling hills are beautiful!

My husband and I had a short 3 day weekend getaway to Napa. The service was wonderful throughout! After our bellman asked and we told him we were celebrating our anniversary, he came back to give us two champagne flutes, a bottle of sparkling wine and a box of decadent truffles. Napa River Inn staff are among the best I've seen. The location of the inn being very close to the highway, the COPIA which is a must-see in Napa, the Wine Train and one block away from the free downtown trolley (which includes a stop at Copia) is a major plus. I'd say the only downside is that the views aren't spectacular from any angle. I wasn't sure what to expect with the photos showing a grain silo-type structure in the middle of the inn. The room itself was clean and nicely decorated with tasteful art depicting Napa vineyards. We had turn down service and chocolate mints on our pillows waiting for us each night. The bathroom walls and floors looked like marble and the sink was actually marble top. The history of the mill adds a lot to the Napa River Inn. Yes, they used to store feed in the buildings a long, long time ago, but the government also used it to store wines and other alcoholic drinks. There are lots of photos, plaques, memorials, and memorabilia on the grounds that explain the interesting history. It's a pet-friendly inn and I saw several guests had their little well-groomed toy dogs with them, the concierge looked like she was informally doggie-sitting when I checked in. I'm allergic and thought that might be a problem but it was not. However, I was sneezing each time I visited a winery, so was glad I brought the antihistamines along. I was worried when our toilet backed up as soon as we arrived but when we called maintenance, they arrived very promptly, fixed it and it was never a problem again! For an extremely quiet and peaceful getaway I would stay elsewhere but for the fairly quiet but centrally located inn with various amenities located nearby, I would definitely recommend the Napa River Inn. The Greenhaus European Spa is across the parking lot and is small but has some good massage therapists and estheticians use Decleor-the best facial product around! The inn is on the same lot as two very popular and bustling restaurants: Angele and Celadon. People will come from other parts of town to dine at these restaurants-and they will crowd the parking lots at night. There is also an art gallery which doubled as a small jazz/blues dance club ($7 cover) on Friday night, a spa supply store and a General Store which sold snacks and unique gift items--however the service of those running the General store (I don't think it's managed by the Inn) was horrendous! There is also a new candy shop on the grounds which has lots of chocolates, etc. to choose from. Many restaurants, wine bars and hangouts are within blocks and Zuzus is one block away for good tapas and sangria. We were willing to do some driving to take in a couple of wineries. Our best find for dining was Rutherford Grille in Rutherford--fantastic! REcommended by the fantastic winery and deli next door (V Sattui). Also, I'd recommend Bistro Jeanty in Yountville for a relaxed and unpretentious but spectacular French menu. Domaine Chandon is a must. And Julia's Kitchen at Copia was great! At the Napa River Inn, we stayed in one of the \"superior\" room with a terrace facing Southeast, a fireplace we didn't use and a river view. There was NO construction going on at all while we were there but the riverbank did look muddy and unattractive. I was surprised there was no greenery other than a few wildflowers across the river; however that is not Napa River Inn's property. I heard and saw a few ducks and geese along the river right outside our terrace and saw the sunrise over the hills and trees in the far distance but there is also a view of a major street and car lot in the distance too--I could barely hear the cars at night but it was still audible. The room itself was neither large nor small. Free bottled Calistoga water in the fridge and Fiji bottled water on the table for $4.50 a bottle. The breakfast in bed which was included with our room rate was superb! We had to choose from danish, bun or scone AND egg/ham or egg/bacon or just egg sandwich on bagel or croissant OR granola and yogurt OR something else AND a choice of juices or tea or coffee. First morning I ordered the scone and the egg/ham bagel sandwich with regular (free) coffee. Second morning, the same but for an extra $4 I ordered a delicious 16 oz. mocha coffee. All of it was piping hot when delivered--you tell them the night before what 30 minute time slot you want it delivered. One morning I changed my mind and wanted it earlier and they gladly obliged by bringing it within 10 minutes. All the breakfast is made at Sweetie Pies which is a delightful bakery that has a large selection of beautifully made gourmet pastries, cakes, cookies, berry crumbles, you name it-they have it all! Hope this helps--be sure you know which direction your room will be facing. I would have hated a room in the plaza building that faces the lobby building and the restaurant outdoor seating area. Basically your window would face another building. But a room with river view although not a breathtaking view will likely be much more enjoyable.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rocklin, California", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed by details\u201d", "Author": "WendyDemy", "ReviewID": "UR3477500", "Content": "Just returned from a one-night stay at the Napa River Inn. We were so excited to be going there because of all the wonderful reviews. Previous to arriving at the Inn, I was informed the type of room I requested would not be available. Because my friend and I (two middle-aged women) wanted separate beds, we were not able to get the balcony or river view we would have preferred. Instead, we had a fireplace (too hot in May) overlooking the parking lot. The room was very pleasant but small, as was the bathroom. We were looking forward to the breakfast in bed from Sweetie Pie's, which is actually just a tray plunked down on the bed. One of us chose the AM Bun, which was certainly nothing special. My friend chose the Danish, which was downright inedible - hard and dry. My quiche was delicious as was her egg croissant. Coffee is made yourself in your room, which I've done many times in other hotels. However, this was the weirdest tasting coffee! We added the cream supplied in our mini-fridge and sugar substitute, as this is the way we usually have our coffee, but could not stand the strange flavor. One more thing that was most unusual for a nice hotel was the lack of water pressure in the shower - practically nonexistent. All in all, I'd have to say that this hotel is way overpriced for what you get although I understand that in the wine country everything's pretty pricey.

Hotel's location was ideal. Staff helpful with offering hotel shuttle to get us to a restaurant on outskirts of town--particularly helpful since I was hobbling around in a cast from a broken ankle. Wine tasting at Bounty Hunter several blocks away was a nice touch. We went back a second night. Hotel itself is a well designed renovation of an old mill and warehouse. Renovations appear to be ongoing and there was construction noise. Also noise from the construction on the 3rd Street/Avenue? bridge over the river. That isn't the hotel's fault, but if you want to sleep in I suggest asking for a room away from the construction. Although promised a room that looked out on a garden, ours (in the historic section) actually looked out on an unimproved lot across the street. Room was lovely with king bed, nice partial canopy and wonderful appointments and amenities in the bathroom. However, price even with AAA discount was $315. for a weeknight--well above the range listed on Trip Advisor. The Sweeties Pies bakery deserves all the kudos it has received in other reviews, but our second day the hotel didn't have enough people to get all the breakfast baskets delivered in a timely way. My husband finally went down to the bakery and picked ours up. Not a big deal, but not breakfast in bed, either. Historic section of the hotel was nice because there weren't very many rooms and there was a wonderful sitting room adjacent to the elevator where one could sit and relax. We had no problem with noise between rooms as has been mentioned. The restaurant Celedon, one of two full-service restaurants in the complex, had outstanding food which was well-priced, I thought. One nice touch--large plate and small plate entrees and no hassle about how one ordered. There is both inside and semi-covered courtyard seating. My husband preferred inside, which is what we did, but next time--the courtyard for sure. One thing about the river--it looks more like a canal. I wouldn't worry if you can't get a room with a view. I would certainly stay at this hotel again, and my husband loved it--particularly the historic feel--but I might try to see if I couldn't get a better rate.", "Date": "August 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Santa Margarita, CA", "Title": "\u201cCute rooms, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2423140", "Content": "I already read the other reviews of the Napa River Inn on Tripadvisor.com, so I arrived there with tempered expectations.

Quite honestly, I was absolutely nervous staying here---the price seemed too good to be true. However, once my partner and I settled in, we recieved wonderful customer service at the front desk! We actually felt welcome, which is a great feeling for our first time in a new city. The rooms are standard, but definitely clean. I'd only recommend making an advance reservation for a microwave if that is a need; but it is not guaranteed. Honestly though that wasn't much of an issue because there are so many hole-in-the-wall restaraunts, we hardly found ourselves carrying any left overs back to the room! Also, many people compalin about the club behind the hotel. Its really not an obscure area, and in fact the hotel itself is right across the street from the Westin---a very high star rated hotel. This confirmed to my partner and I that the area was a safe area, and we found ourselves walking back around 9:00 at night after visiting tourist attractions---and experienced no troubles at all. Its a very safe neighborhood, and I am guaranteed that we will be staying here every chance we get to come to Seattle. Absolutely beautiful city, and beautiful people. California needs to learn a thing or two from this city about composting! Hahaha. Overall though, definitely worth the money---especially if you have AAA. Besides, you're staying for the city, not the room! Did I mention how Google Maps over-exaggerates the distance from Pikes Place Public Market and Space Needle, and other attractions? 6th Avenue is actually one of the main streets that runs through the city, so you're always going to be surrounded by people and no sketchy alleyways. The only place I'd recommend to stay out of is on the weekends (including Friday nights) near the malls. We were seeing a concert on the last night of our stay, and were walking home at around 11-12 pm at night; there were a lot of sketchy fellows out and by the time we reached the Mc Donalds that is neighboring to the Sixth Avenue Inn, we felt secure. I'd say the best time to stay is during the week, so you can enjoy the town for what it is and not get caught in crowds on the weekends. Anyways, GREAT place to stay! AND AFFORDABLE! Disregard those negative comments, people are way too picky about hotels. Again, you're staying for the city, not the hotel! And there is no weird smell to the hotel----people are way overdramatic. And there is not \"a lot of construction\" going on that would disrupt your stay. Its a city for crying out loud, there's always things being torn down and rebuilt.

The hotel is very loud all night long. On the back side of the hotel is strip club so you hear the music til very late in the night. (If I would of know this we wouldnt of stayed because of the strip club due to small children) We went to buy a fan to keep the noise down because of the kids. People were in and out of the rooms and hall way on our floor so that made the noise louder. We paid $212 for both nights with $15 parking each night, which is crazy because we are already paying to stay in the hotel. I wasnt happy.

The Show is at the Washington State Convention & Trade Center, about six blocks from the hotel, so location is great in that regard-don't have to drive in downtown Seattle! They have (some) covered, but not secure parking-it's open to the street, but I never had any trouble with my vehicle. This year they charged $15 a day for parking (which is not unusual in a big city) but last year not. Apparently there was a promo for free parking but our boss didn't get in on that-so check if there's any specials if you're going to an event. Westlake Avenue in on one side of the building and a strip joint on the other, but we never observed anything offensive. Just keep that in mind if you have kids! Room was clean, basic. We didn't know to request a microwave in advance, so make sure you do so when making the reservation. They have a very nice bar & grill in the hotel, but if you're working a trade show for a week you probably don't have the energy for that. One young man at the front dest snotily offered that we could move our room rather than move a microwave in, but another kind gentleman (observing my jaw on the floor) assured us they could manage to move a small appliance in. Thank you James! Biggest problem was the maids apparently don't know how to count towels and don't know about the \"hang your towel up if you want to re-use it\" program. First night I requested an extra bath towel (girls with long hair need two!) We hung them up, but that night found the maid had taken our three towels and left only two clean ones. The \"houseman\" Carlos promptly brought another; I got to know Carlos quite well as we went through this a few nights in a row. I got to be known as the Towel Lady. Best part of this place is the staff. I forgot my personal pillow when packing up. Called the next day and they promptly returned my call having found it.

I felt some pressure bc I did all the planning and research for this trip, also we were traveling with another couple and they decided to stay at this hotel as well; Sixth Ave Inn did not let me down one bit! To start off, for a 3 star hotel, it was more towards 4 star in my book bc I have stayed at a lot of 4 and 5 star hotels. The rooms are clean and remodeled, and it came with a flat screen TV that always gives the room a more modern feel. The staff is very friendly and efficient, checking in and out was a breeze. Parking is only $15 per night, which is cheap compared to the rest of the hotels in Seattle. Some hotels have parking fees of up to $50 per night. Parking spaces are plentiful as well. I always \"liked\" Sixth Ave Inn on Facebook and booked my reservations through Facebook, and got an $80/night rate! My total for 3 nights was about $330 (taxes and parking). For the best part, besides the rate I got, was the location. I couldn't have asked for a better location, it was in the middle of everything. Staying at Sixth Ave Inn is kind of like staying in Union Square for those who have ever been to San Francisco. You can walk a block or two, and you are in a big shopping district. A few short blocks the other way is the Seattle Center, where the Space Needle is located; you can also see the Space Needle from your hotel by the way. Then, for my favorite part of the trip, you walk about 6 short blocks down, and you will arrive at the water, where the Public Market is. The Public Market has some nice restaurants around it, along with many bakeries. The first Starbucks is also here as well. It was about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. When I search for hotels, cleanliness and location matters the most; that convenience factor is very important to me. We barely drove on this trip bc we were able to simply walk! Some places we drove to were Bruce Lee's gravesite at Lakeview Cemetery; we drove to the International District to go to Seattle's first Japanese restaurant known as Maneki, they had great prices btw, and everything we had was super fresh! Other than that, we mainly walked everywhere, which is a huge plus bc we were also able to drink and not have to drive. One night, we partied at Pink Lounge several short blocks away, and we were able to walk, which was a huge plus. Tom Douglas is also a famous chef in Seattle, and there was 3-4 restaurants all in a one or two block radius of the hotel. We dressed up and fine dined one night at Dahlia's Lounge (look up reviews on Yelp, get the duck btw!), and Dahlia's Lounge was only a block and a half away. Serious Pie is right next to Dahlia's Lounge; across the street fro Dahlia's Lounge is Lola's. Palace Kitchen is also a block from Sixth Ave Inn. All these restaurants I mentioned are all Tom Douglas restaurants. There are several other fancier hotels next to the Sixth Ave Inn, such as the Westin, but honestly, I wouldn't choose any other hotel other than the Sixth Ave Inn. The rate I got (80/night), as well as the parking fee (15/night), and the convenience factor are unbeatable. My gf as well as my other two friends were also very satisfied w/ this hotel simply bc we were in the middle over everything.

I'm an extremely light sleeper and they were able to fulfill my request for a higher-floor room, so we weren't right above the bar/grill on the first floor. The bed was comfy, the TV was a flat-screen and the shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion in the bathroom were in adorable containers hung against the wall. Also, I love how they had a recycling bin in the room. Gotta love the Northwest for being so environmentally conscious! The hotel is walking distance to the Space Needle. Seriously, you walk out the main entrance and voila -- there it is! I'd say it's a 10-minute walk at the most. It's also walking distance to Downtown Seattle (Pacific Center, tons of shopping and restaurants) and Pike Place Market. I'd say a 10-15 minute walk, but you don't even realize it because you're walking by all the shops and restaurants. The only thing I didn't like was that the Wi-Fi was shotty. It took us forever to log in and the connection was really slow. It made me wonder if they only have one router on the first floor for the entire hotel because we were barely getting a signal.

Then the maintenance guy told me that front desk guys really just didn't code my key right. Whatever. The workout room is a brutally uninspiring room with a total of three machines (bike, treadmill, and stairclimber). There is a pay-per laundry, which is convenient. I found the bed very comfortable and there is a small desk in the room, but it is not well outfitted for business. For example, I found only one outlet within reach of the desk. When I plugged my phone charger in a wall socket, it would fall out due to the weight of the plug. The place as been around for awhile. There's an on-site restaurant and bar, which is cozy and convenient. Don't expect fine cuisine. This is food that likely comes from some sort of premade service.

The person in the frontdesk wasn't impressed either, but there was nothing they could/would do about it. He tried to convince us that we might have left the \"do not disturb\" sign at the door, which wasn't the case.

For $10-$20 more though on Hotwire you can stay at a 3-4star such as Westin etc. would recommend that. But where the bad takes place is the hospitality; I have traveled all over the world with my bikes for twenty years so when I was checking in I asked if I could leave my case here (which is the size of a suite case airline regulation size) and another suite case while I travel around for a week and I will book a room right now for my return day at whatever the rack rate was which I think was $98. The front desk guy told me they really only store luggage for 24hrs. but I can ask the manager tomorrow. The next day waited to speak and caught up with him and he informed they cannot store my suite cases for a week that they do not have the room. Even though when I was speaking with him they have shelves half empty with suite cases and I seen their laundry maintenance area next to the elevators with plenty of room. I completely understand that no hotel has room if every guest wanted to store stuff for a week. But come on throw it in a corner somewhere and make me sign something that your not liable if that is the issue. Now for where my trip got good again and you see the true hospitality of Seattle people and and other hotel chains why their so successful.

Cons: Paper thin walls, so thin, we were kept awake by our neighbours talking (not yelling, but talking) 'til the wee hours of the morning (5AM). The water pressure in the shower is not the greatest. I think the windows were NOT double glazed, so there was not much insulation from the noise outside, but this did not really bother us as we are used to city noise (in fact, it seemed quieter than what we are used to living in downtown Vancouver). Would I stay here again? Probably not, especially if I can get a 4* hotel on Priceline for approximately the same price.

The hotel is also surrounded by coffee shops, a salon, McDonalds, Westin Hotel, and office buildings. I am sorry, but I really think too big of a deal is made of the Strip Club being around.

The first time I stayed at the Red Lion and loved it; great views, good room, well located. And it had the price to go with all of that. So when I had to go back two weeks later I wanted to stay someplace that was much less expensive. After checking the reviews I selected the Sixth Ave. Inn and was happy with my choice. First, be clear that this hotel is exactly what is described, a budget hotel. It's a good budget hotel but it's not more than that. The front desk staff was great, no one with attitude there! The rooms were not large and are not modern, at least by my standards. However, the two rooms I rented were very clean. I also have to hand it to the hotel for being responsive to guest's concerns. I emailed the hotel when I made the reservations and asked that my rooms be as quiet as possible as this is important to me. Our rooms were reasonably quiet (for a downtown location). I can see that some rooms might get street noise so if this is of concern to you then let the hotel know ahead of time. I was also concerned about the \"gentlemen's club\" that is mentioned in several reviews, as I was booking one of the rooms for a relative that I was meeting in Seattle. Our rooms didn't look that direction but I have to say that it wouldn't have bothered me if they had. The \"club\" is in the next building but it isn't like it's right against the hotel, there is a bit of separation. Things that may raise eyebrows: first, the outside of the building is painted concrete block (at least that's what it appears to be). The building is well maintained generally (there were a few missing tiles in my bathroom but it appears that repair work had recently been done and the tiles not yet re-installed). One thing that I didn't particularly care for were the wall dispensers for the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc. That's personal preference and for the money I was saving I could live with it. In the two rooms that I rented there were no bathtubs, only showers (fine by me). I will also have to say that the air conditioning in our rooms worked great. I happen to hit Seattle during hot spells both times. The a/c at the Red Lion was okay but the a/c at the 6th Ave. could really chill a room. Bottom line: it's a very well run budget hotel. The location is great and I do mean great; we walked everywhere except for the brief ride on the monorail. The staff all seem to have an interest in their guests.

We've booked via companies like Priceline, Expedia, Travelocity and hotwire for 10 years and have never had this excuse given to us; besides, when the invoice specifically stated that we had selected a room with two-queen beds as opposed to one, it really is not supposed to be the customer's problem to deal with.

It was also across the street from an Airporter stop, so we were able to easily get to and from the airport. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We never once passed by the front desk on our way in without being greeted, or on our way out without a \"have a nice day\". And we were in and out a lot! The front desk staff was also very helpful with directions and recommendations on where to eat or sites to see. We didn't use the internet in our room, but we did use the computers in the lobby. It especially came in handy when it came time to print our boarding passes for our trip home. We knew we wouldn't spend much time at the hotel so we weren't looking to spend much money on one. But our time spent there was always pleasant. If you're looking for an inexpensive hotel walking distance to just about everything, we'd highly recommend this place. We're planning to return to Seattle next summer, and we'll definitely be staying at Sixth Avenue Inn again. Oh one more thing. I remember reading negative reviews here first complaining about the strip club across the street. But decided to take a chance and stay here anyway. Our room faced the club and my husband didn't even realize it was there until I pointed it out on our last night. There was no loud noise and with our curtains closed there was no problem with the neon signs. And the club is actually on the back side of the hotel, not in front, so you'd never even have to walk passed the place. And the area was NOT \"shady\".

They're clean, but old... and small. * The overall hotel is, old. * The overall hotel and my \"nonsmoking\" room just smelled... a mixture of smoke and various bodily odors that apparently mixed into the establishment over the years. * The bed / mattress--> old and soft. * The bottomline--> Motel 6 is a better quality motel / rooms at a cheaper price. The problem is, there are no Motel 6s in the downtown area. It's one of the dilemmas, if you want to be in a decent location and want a nice room, you'll have to pay the extra 100.0-150.00 / night.

I would stay at this hotel again, but I would bring earplugs.", "Date": "January 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4138454", "Content": "Be sure to verify reservations before arrival, fortunately we did. Even though we made ours on their website and were given a confirmation number, they had no record. When we first entered our room there was a very musty smell. Then we were surprised at how stained the carpet was. The furniture was all chipped and worn, the walls definitely needed painted. When we entered the little bathroom the paint peeling from the ceiling was quite obvious. I sprayed perfume in the room so we could stand to stay there. The one bed was apparent that most people slept on the left side, you rolled that way. I did bring it to the attention of the front desk and he said we could move the next day. The next morning while my husband was showering, he came out very unhappy. The obvious peeling paint was from the tub above our room, as it drained cold water on his head. We were then transfered to another room that wasn't much cleaner. When you opened the bathroom door it only opened half way as it got caught on the floor. Big tripping hazard. Will never stay there again. Spend a little more on another place, it will be well worth it. This place is WAY over priced and very unkept. Erga in the lounge was great though.", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cPleasant but not luxury - will return\u201d", "Author": "mojave_ben", "ReviewID": "UR4102703", "Content": "Twice I have stayed here as a cheap alternative to the Westin, where I was at a conference. For $100 less per night, you get a perfectly adequate room. They may have done some work in the two years since I was last there. I found the room fine, though it and the bath were a bit small. Iron, coffee maker, hair dryer, lights and TV fine. The food is OK but the restaurant a bit on the dark side. I really liked my little room, except the windows are single pane and daytime traffic noise is a bit loud (get a room on the upper floor, or at the back). This is a budget hotel, but it is not a dive. Definitely a step up from Motel 6 style places. Lots of food in the places - just blocks from Westlake Center. Bed and linens were just fine. I have always found the staff to be pleasant.

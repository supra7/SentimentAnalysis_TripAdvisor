Purchased a king non-smoking room at hotels.com for $79. We arrived about 10 AM due to an early flight from MDW and the dest clerk said our room hadn't been cleaned yet but if we wanted to check in early he had either a king smoking or a double queen we could have. We opted for the king smoking, as it's been our experience in other hotels that it's not been a problem, especially as I used to smoke and the smell doesn't bother me. The desk clerk also commented that they usually charge additional money for early check-in but that he wouldn't charge us this time but he wanted us to be aware that they might not extend this courtesy the next time we stay there.. We were assigned room 127, first floor, with a view of the pool. Opening the door, the overpowering smell of stale cigarrette smoke was obvious. My fault, I know , because I ok'd the room. I just have never smelled such a stench in any hotel I've ever stayed at. We immediately opened the windows and turned on the fan, and several hours later the smell was gone. The room was good sized, king bed, a mini fridge, tv, a couple of chairs, desk with free wi-fi. I noted the stains on the arms of the upholstered chair and on the carpet. Hard to tell if these were permanent stains or if they were just dirty. We also noticed a lot of cobwebs in the corners near the floor. The king bed came with two postage stamp sized fiberfill pillows, which were about as pleasant to sleep on as a bag of potato chips. The continental breakfast was free, probably because they would have been embarrassed to charge for it. I drank a cup of coffee and then went to the restaurant next door to eat. My husband noticed his shirt was wrinkled from being in the suitcase and we couldn't find an iron in the room, even though the hotel brochure said they had them, so we decided to follow the time honored practice of steaming it in the shower. The water was extremely hot, and we had a nice steam going in minutes. When we opened the bathroom door to remove the shirt the steam set off the smoke detector. Funny thing, though, no one ever came to our room or called to see why. Good thing there wasn't a fire. . .

I didn't feel this was a time to argue the point. I took a room that was currently clean and we settled in. The free wireless internet was nice. We went out to eat and then came back for a good night sleep... or though we thought. In the wee morning hours (around 1am) there was yelling outside of our room door. Men were screaming at each other that they were going to beat each other up. It went on for a couple of minutes then silence. I then went back to sleep. An hour later it happened again. This time it only lasted about 30 seconds then silence again. There were no more incidents that night. We awoke in the morning to a wonderful day... or so we thought. We got up and I went in to take a nice shower. Well, it would have been nice if there were hot water. No matter which direction I turned the handle or how long I let it run it was pure cold.

Nothing was mentioned about the rooms. I then asked the front desk about it. I was advised that since there were no clean rooms left (see maid problem above) that they might be able to find me a dirty room to shower in that was close to me. I declined.

Let us start with parking, there is none. There are signs all over the place warning you that if you park at Grinder's, the establishment next door, you will be towed. There is a guy in a car monitoring the lot just for that purpose. The hotel is old, we stayed on the 3rd floor with renevations in progress. They will have to work on the place for a long time. The rugs throughout are dirty and musty smelling. We kept the windows open with the air on to help with the smell. I rode the elevator once, and that was it for me! Servicing??? Needs replacement. There is a notice posted in the room that inventory of the towels will be taken each day and anything missing will be charged to your room. Who would want those towels??????? The bath towel is the size of the hand towel and the quality is that of the ones I would use for cleaning. You would never see such a notice at the most upscale hotels who use towels most people couldn't even dream of affording. Internet service is advertised, there is none. Couldn't even hook up to the phone line, it wasn't working. The only positive aspects, are the close proximity to the port (walking distance) and the bedding was clean (no stains or hair) and the toilet was clean. Even with those positives, I would not stay there again.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3654929", "Content": "I was very pleased with the service we received when checking in early after a cruise. We arrived at 11:30 am. Sunrise had our rooms available and they were very gracious in checking us in early. It is an older hotel, but the room we had was very large (compared to newer hotels). Our wing of the hotel was very quiet although I heard another guest complain about the noise in their wing. A wedding party was staying there. We had a great breakfast by the pool. My one concern was the elevator. It was noisy and made a strange clang. I kept wondering if it was in need of service. Also another bright spot was the restaurant next door - Grinders. We had lunch there the next day and had the best service we've had in a long time. I wish I could remember the waitress's name. My husband and I both commented on the service after leaving the restaurant, so it wasn't just me.", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cBreakfast was awesome. Just missing some bacon...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3558372", "Content": "Hi all, My husband and I were going on a cruise and decided to go a day early to San Pedro so we could do some sightseeing, so we booked at this hotel. It's very close to the port of LA as well as the port o' call villages so that's the main reason we stayed here. The shuttle service to the port is free with the 'fly & cruise' package so you just have to tip the driver and as far as the hotel staff goes, we had some mixed service but overall they're very sweet and accomodating. We got there early before check-in and they held our luggage so we could go sightseeing asap, but they led us to a side room to leave them in. Now this room had a lot of other junk in it (old beds, lamps that needed repair) so that was a bit of a shock. But hey, it was locked and they were watching it so that wasn't a biggie. After we walked around for a few hours, we went back to the hotel to get our luggage from the side room and then our room keys from the front desk. Now, the lobby area has a small kisok. We didn't think anything of it until the morning that we were leaving but we should have checked it sooner! It has a listing of eateries and sights in San Pedro, and how to get around with the trolley. You can also print out maps from this kiosk. So you reading this - don't forget to check out the kiosk. We did it but it was too late by then - we found out there was a classic car convention the day we came in. Oh well! Ohhhh and breakfast the next day was SO good, we were full like we were at a buffet! The only thing missing was meat- sausages or bacon or something, but otherwise they had everything else. There was a belgian waffle station, the juice station (oj, guava juice), there was a cereal station, a mini-bagel station with cream cheese and jam, and a toast and fruit station. Not to mention the coffee and the tea. Needless to say, we were very full and happy. We also grabbed some fruit (bananas, apples & oranges) to take back to our room to snack on. Now the piece de resistance. The room: Overall, it was great. It was well-kept and clean. The decor was outdated but we would rather have a clean room than up-to-date furniture. The AC was super-strong (and boy did we need it cuz it was a hot weekend) and the internet connection was fast and cheap. The tv had most channels (mtv, cnn) and there was a little fridge at the bottom of the tv cabinet. The bathroom was kinda small but it didn't bother us at all and the water from the shower was wonderful - strong pressure too. We stayed on the 2nd floor by the way. So hey, it's a great bargain for the price just for the breakfast alone. Other things: There's a restaurant next door but we don't recommend it. They had kind of bland food. Instead go to the Beach City Grill about 4 blocks up in the 'downtown' area. They have all kinds of meat and seafood dishes like plantain cakes and crab cakes and pasta and cinnamon iced tea.", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ca", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3275180", "Content": "Stayed here prior to Feb. 17, 2005 cruise.

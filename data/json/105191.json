All of the exterior doors were locked and not even able to be opened from the inside in case of a fire. The north stairway was obstructed with furniture and storage items like breakfast boxes, microwaves, and small efficiency refrigerators, like a closet. Hello!? Ever heard of emergency exits for fires? I spoke to the manager, and he told me in his broken English that they locked the doors to keep out prostitutes and other criminals. Nice! EVEN THE LOBBY DOOR WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE DURING THE LATE HOURS, WHEN I VENTURED OUT TO MY VEHICLE! Once I raised holy Cain about this to get out, I saw why. There were prostitutes working the parking lot and they were of the most dreadful variety. I say this as a truck driver who has seem my share of true \"Lot Lizards.\" The sleep was fine, the shower was pleasant. In the morning, I went to iron a shirt and it was ruined with the rust that poured out of the iron. The manager did not care when I explained the concerns. The Memphis Fire Department, however, sent an inspector IMMEDIATELY when I called. Look out for the hidden $1.50 charge for insurance and safe use, if you do not use it. This is a B.S. charge and I have to dispute it at check out at most hotels any more... If you'd like to die in a fire so your family can legitimately receive your life insurance and maybe some wrongful death suit income, stay here for a few days and hope for the best!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "rick v", "ReviewID": "UR122686186", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel last weekend.

The sink did not drain well, as the pull rod was not connected. Also at checkout, which was very early in the morning, the night clerk would not or could not comply with my request to remove the fee for the in room safe that I did not use. Dummy me, I guess when checking in (tired, after a long day) I should have read the fine print concerning initialing something I did not want. I don't think he understood English.

I must say the room was surprisingly nice; however, during my last night there I lost my $1200.00 Movado watch in the room. I advised the front desk of my lost. I had pulled the watch off in the room that evening to take a shower and discovered the next morning while I was getting dressed for church that I could not find my watch. I didn't make a big fuss about it because we were in a hurry and I thought maybe in my haste I may have placed it in my personal belongings. I did let the attendant at the front desk know to check the room thoroughly for my watch because I knew really in my heart of hearts it was in the room and may have fallen behind the night stand or just fell somewhere out of my eye sight. It wasn't possible for it to fall under the bed. Once I got back to Illinois and cleaned out my suitcase and personal affects, my watch was no where to be found. Just like I thought it was still in the room. I called back since no one bothered to call me and the guy at the front desk really didn't believe I had lost my watch in the room and he had a very nasty attitude and got very loud with me. The watch was very sentimental to me and I have had the watch for over 8 years. I cannot believe that it wasn't returned to me. Someone at this Sleep Inn hotel on American Way has my watch. I want to say to this person that found my watch, honesty is the best policy and nothing good will come to them.

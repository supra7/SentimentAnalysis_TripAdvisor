Overall, it is a good hotel, but it has some significant cons in my view. It has a pretty good location, close to freeway and La Jolla Village square shopping center. It is in atrim style architecture. The room is spacious and clean including a small frig and microwave. The bathroom is clean. We were on the 12th floor and were nicely surprised we did not hear much noise from outside the room given the style it is. Breakfast time was pretty crowded, but it seems good. Now the cons: Internet is about $10/day in the room. There is no free wifi in the lobby which many hotels do have it free in the lobby. The parking is about the worst I have seen. It has a few parking spaces to one side of the hotel, and a 3 storey parking structure. The parking slot for each car is very narrow, and the drive through path is narrow too. When a car goes out and while a car comes in, one of them has to back out in order for the other to go through. And you'd have to make a u-turn to drive out as the structure does not have a drive out path from the top parking storey. It is difficult if a car parked there for you to make a u-turn. And there are big block columns as well as cars parked right there at the turns so you are always afraid to hit either the block or the car. When I complained about the parking, the front desk gave me a designated parking space by the side of the hotel which is not that big either. So we end up still using the structure. They need to redesign and build a new parking structure. Another minor point is if someone is afraid of height, do not take a room on high floors due to the atrim open style architecture. It takes some getting used to. And there were a lot of kids running around in the hotel perhaps due to the weekend when we stayed. The pool was crowded with kids. So overall, the hotel room itself is good but amenities are not up to par. Its parking brought down its scores for me. If you don't have to worry about parking, then it is not a bad choice.

My wife and I had a suite on the 12th (top) floor, and we discovered a drip coming from the ceiling in the corner of the sitting area -- either a leak in the roof or the plumbing had obviously been there for a while, since the ceiling was heavily stained and bits of the ceiling had fallen off at some time in the past. We reported this to the front desk, and they were very apologetic and offered to move us to a different suite. We didn't feel like repacking all our stuff, though, and the drip wasn't really bothering us that much.

It's an atrium-style layout with 11 floors. I had a 1 bedroom suite (true suite, not divider walled) that was spacious and well appointed. The hotel was completed renovated 5 years ago and further fitted with flat screen TVs a year ago. In addition to the usual coffee maker there is also a small fridge and microwave. Internet is about $10 and self-parking is $20. Everyone was friendly--I had to go to the nearby Hyatt for dinner and the bellman was happy to drive me over in the van. The fitness room is a little small for the size of the hotel, just three treadmills, a couple of elliptical trainers, and that's about it. It wasn't too busy when I was in there at 8 am but it wouldn't take much to fill it up. The indoor pool looked nice but too small for laps. There is a hot tub outside. The free breakfast buffet has a good selection of hot and cold items. It ends at 9 am so I stopped by after my workout, loaded some things onto a tray and ate in my room later, which worked out well. It did seem to get a little crowded and there were several people waiting in line for the omelet station. The Embassy Suites is not as nice as the Hyatt 5 minutes down the road, and you can't beat the Hyatt's beautiful lap pool and nextdoor enormous health club which Hyatt guests can use (for $13 I think).

When you factor in these perks, you can justify the price being somewhat higher than other accommodations. In this case, some of those perks were cancelled out by the $20 daily parking fee, but that seems typical for the San Diego area. Hard to find lodging without some form of parking that tends to be from $15 to $35 daily, so the Embassy Suites is right there. Although their parking garage is poorly laid out and because of the single lane entrance/exit, if the garage is full then someone will have to back up if you find yourself in a situation where someone is traveling in the opposite direction from you; i.e., coming in while you're trying to exit. Because parking is scarce, you may also find yourself playing that awkward game where the car that wants your space will absolutely, positively not budge to give you a single inch of extra space because of the fear that your spot will be taken by someone else. Is this the fault of Embassy Suites? Probably not, but when it's rainy and windy in San Diego... it's just not fun. The parking garage has two covered levels and one rooftop level and you do have to walk in open air to get into the structure. FYI for those rainy times. I was surprised that the room was so dark. You have to use the interior lights at all times while in the room. The bathroom has an awkward layout with its huge, oversized door that requires all the space in front of the wardrobe to swing. Beware of that to avoid hitting anyone that is getting something out of the closet. There is an interior control of the cooling/heating in the room.

We all like the hotel, and will consider staying here again the next time we visit SD. Pluses: + SPACIOUS CLEAN ROOM ~ We got a standard 2-room suite. Our room was well appointed with a microwave, an empty mini fridge, a wet bar, a full-sized sofa pullout in the sitting area, and a kig sized bed in the bedroom + GOOD LOCATION ~ Easy access to major freeways, 10 mins. drive to SD beaches, a mid to high-end malls just opposite the hotel, lots of restaurants nearby + PROFESSIONAL AND FRIENDLY STAFF ~ There were many families with kids (MANY!) at the hotel during our stay. The lobby was quite chaotic, esp. during breakfast and happy hour reception. However, the staff were well trained and were able to keep the place together. Minses: - PARKING CHALLENGES ~ The hotel garage is really TIGHT. We drove a RX350, and had difficult times getting in and out of the garage. If you had to use the garage, I suggest parking your car on the first level. On the upper floors, inflow and outflow traffic SHARE ONE SINGLE LANE. We had to park our car on the street on the 1st night b'cos the garage was full, due to a function at the hotel (Hotel did refund our parking fees after we spoke). And street parking was quite tricky on the Labor Day weekend. Patrons to PF Changs would park their car on the street too. We were lucky to always get the LAST spot for our car when we return at around 8pm. - ROOM NEAR ELEVATOR IS NOISY ~ We stayed in a room #830, across from the hotel elevators. My boys slept on the pullout in the sitting area. They complained about the noisy elevators and people getting in/out of it. My husband and I slept in the bedroom, and we did not hear the noises. Guess rooms near elevators are ok as long as no one is sleeping in the sitting area. - INDOOR POOL NOT HEATED, AND OUTDOOR JACUZZI IS TINY ~ well, just our preference - FEE FOR WIRELESS INTERNET ~ However you may use the business center computers to get free access to internet. There are only 2 computers. * The frontdesk has printouts of restaurants nearby, mall map as well as a local map of La Jolla. ** There is a small, nice and kid-friendly pizzeria called Regent Pizza on the NE corner of La Jolla Village Dr. and Regent Rd. It is a few doors next to Starbucks and Einstein Bagels. It makes both NY and Boston style pizza. We had their NY pizza and salads...YUM! *** Also tried sushi at BlueFin, which is in the mall parking lot, next to Wells Fargo.

Location: 20 minutes from every attraction in San Diego, 1 mile from Hwy 5. Hotel is located directly across the street from large mall (150+ stores). It shares a parking lot with PF Changs. 2 major strip malls with McDonalds, CVS, Baskin Robbins, Supermarkets ect... are located within 3 blocks (10 minute walk). On of the most beautiful churches you will ever see was less then a mile away. Was even nicer at night when it was lit up. PARKING IS NOT AN ISSUE: we had 5 cars and had no problem parking on the street at all hours of the day & night. Property is nothing special, located in area with office buildings. Small fountain and nice landscaping as you approach. 3 story parking garage off to the side. Inside lobby had nice ponds with large coi fish. Several large screen TV's had sporting events on all night. Pool is small, but served its purpose. Plenty of towels all day and night. Pool closed at midnight. Sauna and hot tub were clean. Gym was small but again, served its purpose. Rooms were spacious and clean. Only negative would be the loud air conditioning units cycling on & off. Refrigerator was not working but maintenace brought up a new unit in under 5 minutes. Towels were plentiful & house keeping did a great job all week. Rooms had blowdryer, iron & board, coffee machine & microwave. 2 TV's, No in room safe, but you could get a safety box down at front desk. Washer & dryer were free and available pretty much all the time. Great perk ! Complimentary breakfast was good ever day. Never waited more then 5-7 minutes on line for cook to order omlettes. Always plenty of food. Good selection of frenchtoast, pancakes, eggs, cereal, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurts, oatmeal & 4 different juices, 5 different teas. Breakfast was a great value, only drawback was that it ended at 930 on weekdays (would prefer 10am) 1030 on weekends. Finding table was never an issue and the dining area was kept clean by freindly & smiling workers. Complimentary Happy Hour 530-730PM every nite was another great value. Nothing like coming in from sightseeing all day and grabbing a cold bud light or killians. The hotel seems to cater to alot of families, would have loved to seen a room set up with video game, ping pong table ect... Think security guards would appreciate that as well as they were chasing kids all weekend long. lol Overall, the Embassy Suites La Jolla was a great value. It wouldnt have been my choice of hotel being that it was 20 minutes away from most attractions, however it was easy to get to and never any traffic. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would reccommend this hotel to other families. Only 10 minutes from La Jolla Coves where you can go kayaking to the caves. Also worth the short drive at sunset to \"Childrens Pool\" where you can also see seals & sealions hanging out on the rocks. Seaworld was nice, San Diego Zoo was over rated (Bronx Zoo much nicer) Petco Park is beautiful baseball stadium. Old Town was nice with good Mexican Restaurants, Little Italy was Little. Only several blocks long and located on India Street, still cant figure that out??? Gaslamp Section was nice. Bay Front was nice. Coronado is definetly worth a day trip. Beaches of Southern California are over rated. Miami Beach & Florida beaches blow them away. Water is warmer, sand is whiter & softer. San Diego was a nice, small & clean city.

The complimentary breakfast can be busy, but service is good, there is plenty of seating and the range and selection of breakfast items (including omelets and French toast) is enough to ensure you won't need anything else until lunch. There is a happy hour in the late afternoon with complimentary drinks and snacks. There's also an indoor pool which we didn't use, but was certainly popular during our summer visit. The lounge area on the ground floor is very comfortable and the water feature with large koi fish are relaxing and make for a very comfortable and relaxing environment, and a special treat for younger visitors. There are a number of dinner options within a five or ten minute walking distance and a major shopping centre with a food court during the day. If you need transport they have an excellent service which we used to go (twice) to the airport. Front office staff were particularly helpful. We arrived very early on our first visit (flights from Australia arrived at 7am and we were in San Diego before 11am) and although no rooms were ready at that early hour they stored our bags then delivered them to the room before our check-in in the mid-afternoon.

What surprised me is that there are a lot of families here, which translates into lots of kids. Guests aside, the hotel is clean, modern and very guest friendly. Free breakfast, 2-hour free drink daily, what else can you ask? I stayed in the Executive suite. Upon check-in I was greeted by if not one of the most friendly staff I've ever met. Prompt service and makes me feel like a valued guest all the way. The room is very clean, nicely lay out and make me feel like home. Now if you staying here on a weekend or peak-tourist periods, you will hear kids. Door closed or not. Some running some screaming, but if that bother you or not is up to you. The bedroom on the other hand is like a standard hotel room but upgraded. Ceiling-to-floor window, comfortable bed and sheets. However if your room is facing the streets, prepare to hearing some car noises. Also the A/C unit can be loud. In my case it actually woke me up when it kicked in. However you can always keep it running to combat the outside noise but it's louder than comfortable level to sleep soundly, if you are a light sleeper. Over all I suggest this hotel to those who wants to get a suite but don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. However some noise problem might be important to those who likes peace and quiet. This hotel is more suitable for families than business-travelers.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "so cal", "Title": "\u201cBest Embassy Suites in San Diego Area\u201d", "Author": "joantri", "ReviewID": "UR103049990", "Content": "We have stayed at the other Embassy Suites in the San Diego area and this one is far nicer than the others.

Our only complaints were the extra (and in our minds, excess) daily charges for what many hotels include for free: $19 for parking and $14ish for internet, and the lack of responsiveness from the front desk. When we complained about the internet charge, the front desk mentioned they had a business center where we could use the internet for free. It's not the same. Also, we had a few issues with our room--the phone in the bedroom would not call the front desk and the bathtub would not drain. We called about both and neither was fixed nor was there a follow-up call to verify the isses had been addressed. The coffee in the room was never refilled.

We had a room on a high floor which I had requested, I would say it would be pretty noisy in your living room where the sofa bed is if you had a room on a lower floor and near the elevator. The living areas all face the atrium and the noise from downstairs does drift upstairs, nice and quiet in the bedroom though. My main criticism was the location of the internal doors, they were ridiculous. The one through to the bedroom was right next to the cupboard door where the microwave was, you had to shut the bedroom door all the time to open the cupboard door to use the microwave. It was very awkward, just bad planning when they constructed it!! Also, the parking was $19 a day, don't bother paying for this. Park on the road, there is plenty of parking on the streets around the hotel so save your money. It was fairly close to the freeway so easy to get to Sea World, about 15 minutes. We also went to Legoland which was about a 20 minute drive north just off the freeway. There was a PF Changs right outside the hotel which was great and also a Westfield shopping centre across the road too which had Sears and Macys plus lots of other shops. Breakfast was included and there was also a happy hour/manager's reception every day from 5-7pm which was great. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Check in was quick - we arrived at 1 pm, and our room was ready despite of the fact that check in time, I think, is 4 pm. Suite was a little bit dark, but I guess, all suites are like this unless you take a corner suite with the balcony. Room was clean and noise level is OK. I didn't hear our neighbors upstaires or in the next room. Location is OK - it took us 10 mins to drive to drive to La Mesa and dine at their \"Red Lobster\". La Jolla shores are 10 mins away as well. It was nice to stroll there in the evening. Seaworld is 15 mins away on I-5. Breakfast and happy hour every day are included in room price. Breakfast could be a little better though. Very limited amount of fruits and veggies. Only banana and oranges, and actually no veggies at all. No yougurt or cottage cheese. At least, Hilton Suites include those items in their free breakfast. Evening happy hour included all kinds of wine and coctails (with the show of ID and your room key), chips and salsa, pretzels and slices of pita bread with little bit of hummus on them. Indoor pool was always crowded though, with kids in particular. I booked this hotel because of it's indoor pool knowing that it can be chilly in SoCal in March-April. My daughter swam there, however, all days - in the morning and in the evening, but I coulldn't get it because of tons of screaming and splashing kids. But that's Ok with me, I didn't want to swim anyways... Pool towels were too tiny, but I guess, it's OK for the kids. Oh, and no robes in the room (just comparing it with Hilton Suites). Also, there was too much chlorine in the pool - I could't comb my daughter's hair after each swim... We haven't tried their restaurant \"Indulge\", but it looked nice in the evening, especially the patio with heated lamps, couches with pillows and fire pits. Not sure if we'll return to this place next time. May be if the prices will be cheaper. I paid around $150 per night. Once again comparing to earlier stay at Hilton Suites, where we stayed in corner suite - light and bright - and where I paid $90 per night.... Oh, and they charge $19 for parking per night, and it's not a vallet (Hilton charged $12)...", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place, Good area\u201d", "Author": "SDNX", "ReviewID": "UR61996880", "Content": "This is one of the best Embassy Suites I have stayed at.

Had it not been for the staff, I wouldn't even be bothering to write this review. I typically only write reviews when it is very good (and thus want to steer people to the business) or very bad (feel a duty to warn fellow travelers!). So an OK-ish hotel wouldn't merit my time, but I feel I have to take a moment to recognize the fact that while the hotel is not a great value or particularly outstanding in other respects, the kindness and professionalism of the staff merit a note: -I woke up one morning and was immediately buried in work and before I knew it, I had missed breakfast. I called down to ask if maybe there was still food at the buffet and they said it had already been cleared away. Two minutes later, they called back and said, \"Can I get the kitchen to whip you up an omelet or something?\" They brought it to my room ten minutes later, no charge. That small kindness just changed my outlook on the day and really reduced my stress level! I wish I had gotten the lady's name to recognize her above-and-beyond help. -Next day, I checked out and left in a rush to catch my 6 AM flight up to SFO. Got to security and realized I had left ALL my hanging clothes in the closet back at my room..pair of pants, jacket and two shirts. I called the hotel and a very nice person in housekeeping promised to send them to me. Two days after I got home, they were there: they had UPSed them two-day express. Again, above and beyond.

Other than a very unfortunate situation that I'll describe below, we had a great visit and would certainly return. Pros: Newly refurbished rooms that are very nicely furnished. Living room faces hallway which gives the bedroom some noise buffer. The free breakfast and happy hour are awesome. The fitness room is brand new and has the best cardio equipment I've seen in a hotel. Cons: The $19 parking/night tops the list. This feels like robbery, so definitely walk the block or two and use the free street parking. I hate paying for internet but given the room rate we were able to get and it being $10 per 24 hrs I can't complain too much. The big con we experienced on our trip was the obscenely loud new year's eve party that was booked at the hotel. I'm a reasonable person and NYE is the night to party. But I consider it the hotel's responsibility to ensure that all guests' needs and desires are met equally. The noise was so intrusive and pervasive that it was really unacceptable. The party basically turned the lobby/courtyard into a nightclub with all the noise. From our living room, the music was LOUD and with young children trying to sleep, this was a nightmare. We called down to the front desk and were met with the rude response of \"well, it IS New Year's Eve\" along with a very half-hearted \"I will see what I can do\". My wife was so upset that she went down to the front desk and asked to speak with the general manager. At this point, I have to really compliment the general manager (David). Seeing that moving rooms at 10:45PM was not an option for us, The GM listened to our request for partial compensation and graciously agreed. He was courteous, apologetic, and said that he had young kids of his own so he understood the situation. Clearly he was put in a bad situation by whoever from special events/catering booked the party and failed to manage it, but he did a very good job turning a big negative into a decent situation.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWelcoming and well located\u201d", "Author": "geronimoturtle", "ReviewID": "UR52457999", "Content": "We stayed for 1 night as we needed to be in La Jolla for Thanksgiving.

Lots of restaurants and a nice mall close by with a playground for small children. The few negatives are: the sofa bed was awful - it was ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress felt like springs with a sheet on top. Every spring was sticking out. They really need to replace them. I had a relative staying in another room, and her sofa bed was the same way, so it wasn't just our room. Also, other Embassy Suites I've stayed in had a nice kitchenette. This just had a very small area behind the door - the fridge didn't get very cold, and there was no freezer, which was disappointing. Still, it was nice to have the sink, fridge and microwave, however, small. The pool is nice for adults (even has a sauna) but definitely not a place for kids to play, so if your family expects to hang out in the pool, this is not the place. It's indoors, and is just a small rectangle pool with no shallow area for kids to play, not even large steps to hang out on. Also, the hotel rooms could really use a shelf or two in the bathroom. If you have more than one person, there's nowhere to put toiletries, etc. other than on the sink. If they just stuck a shelf on the wall, it would really help create more storage space. Lastly, they could really use a little noise buffer from the lobby, like more plants. All the rooms surround the lobby, and even though we were high up on the Honors floor, the noise still drifted up when there was happy hour or a band playing. We were prepared for the parking cost, we just considered it part of the overall cost of the hotel, however, it's very inconvenient - three stories with no elevator and only one lane in the garage - two cars can't pass eachother, one needs to back out for the other to get by.

The other negative is the pool, it is very chorinated I suspect it seems so strong because it is indoors.

The complimentary breakfast was excellent (cooked to order omlettes, eggs, sausages, bacon, variety of toasts and pastries, oatmeal, fruits, dry cereal with milk and a variety of juices). The breakfast is from 6:00 am to 9:00 am but it's best to go early and avoid the crowd (it never really got too busy). They also have a FREE cocktail hour from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm where they serve free alcohol and mixed drinks. The parking lot isn't too big and they charge $19 a day. There is a pretty good mall right across the street and a P.F. Chang's restaurant right outside the lobby. The location is good (a minute away from the 805 and a few minutes away from the I-5).

Room on 8th floor was nice - 1 King bed with flat screen in separate room, bathroom, closets, sofa bed, flat screen, desk & chair, and side chair in front room. There was also a fridge in a closet across from a separate sink - bar area. Didn`t see until 2nd day because the doors to the bathroom and main room open strangely and into the closet where the fridge is. The room was on the smallish side for 4 people - if the kids were older we would have to have 2 rooms as they shared the sofa bed. The sofa bed was uncomfortable for them so after the first night I requested a mattress pad which was brought up within 10 minutes. They were much more comfortable after that and no complaints. Breakfast included each day was pretty good - nice to have a bite without having to decide where to go. Some days the omelete station was the only hot food choice (with bacon, sausage, etc.) and other days there were hot trays with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausage. The omelete station was open every day and the cooks are super fast. Less than two minutes wait for the food. Other choices were pancakes, fruit, cereals, muffins, bread, coffee, tea, juices. We ate in the atrium every morning and were not disappointed at all - we ate and were ready to go. There is a nightly cocktail reception which is also a nice touch. Premium liquor is offered as well as soft drinks and nachos, chips, etc. We found a place to sit and enjoy. Again - all included in the price of the room. Free internet room - great to have although I didn`t realize it until our 2nd last day. The kids found the pool to be fun and I sat with them in the hot tub which was nice. Can``t comment on the gym but looked in and saw a few machines as well as free weights as well as tv. The location is great - close to everything - ie Zoo, Legoland, Sea World, SS Midway, etc. Just a short drive to each and easy to find. Also a good restaurant in the hotel as well as PF Chang``s next door. There is a mall across the street - we walked over and ate at Cozymel`s which we all enjoyed. Ask the front desk for a list of restaurants nearby and they will provide a long one with distances to each and whether they are formal or informal and descriptions of each place. Overall - Embassy Suites was a decent hotel with a good breakfast and cocktail hour included. Our kids enjoyed feeding the Koi fish in the lobby and the glass elevators. We would recommend this place and would stay here again. Just make sure you have good directions if you arrive at night as we did. Got lost a few times as we were not too familiar with San Diego and there are no street lamps on the highways! Couldn``t see a thing!

We picked a hotel in La Jolla instead of central San Diego because we wanted a place convenient to both Legoland and San Diego. This hotel is that - it is about 20 miles from Legoland and about 15 miles to downtown San Diego. It took me only 20 minutes to get to the airport on a Saturday morning - no traffic. This hotel is in a nice, safe area with a lot of apartment buildings and office buildings. There is a shopping mall right across the street, and many small strip malls nearby to get food and groceries. I don't know if anyone ever needs it but there is a post office one block west on Genessee in a little strip mall with a Starbucks. The room was spacious because it had a separate living room with sofabed. The sofabed is very uncomfortable because it is uneven and you can feel the coils in the mattress. The beds in the bedroom are great though, very plush and comfortable. A minor inconvenience was the door to the microwave/fridge. You have to close the living room door to get to the fridge which is covered by shutterdoors, but like I said, it was a minor thing. Apparently you can ask for adjoining rooms because there was a door to the next room right by the sofabed. Something to keep in mind if you have extended families vacationing together. The carpet was a little worn but aside from that, the room had recently been renovated so it looked clean and fresh. Nice touch to have a shower massage head in the shower. The FREE washers and dryers are on floors 2-5 and 12. One set on each of those floors. They are located by the ice and vending machine and are not marked by a sign. You have to walk past the vending machine, and open the door that at first glance looks like the stairwell door. Some washers don't work really well, but hey, I needed to do laundry and it was free. The dryers all worked well. Bring your own detergent if you can, but they have detergent available in the gift shop for $2. If you have more than one load, I found it very convenient to go from floor to floor using the service elevator that is right in laundry room. On other floors the \"laundry\" area is used for storage, so don't expect it to be clean. The staff was friendly and efficient and was very helpful whenever we asked them questions. The free breakfast, their signature cook-to-order hot breakfast grill was as wonderful as usual. The area is very large and provides for many people to be there at the same time. The only time it was crowded was on Friday morning when the next group of spring breakers checked in. That day, I waited in line for an omelet but it took less than 5 minutes to get my order out because they are very efficient. They offer freshly cooked pancakes at the grill but they can also be found in the buffet area, along with bacon and sausage, so you can get a full-on breakfast without having to wait for an omelet. The lobby has a lot of tables and chairs so you can always find a spot to sit, but since there was a table and chairs in our room, we always ate there. They provide trays so you can carry your plates upstairs. The pool is indoors and also has a sauna and hot tub. The fitness center is small but has several treadmills. It is located in the same room as the pool. I thought it was convenient for parents to be able to watch their kids in the pool while being right there in the workout room which is glass enclosed. Also convenient is being able to go into the sauna after a workout, then jump into the pool or hot tub - good floor plan. Other people mentioned that there was ample parking on the street so they didn't have to pay to park in the parking lot, but everytime we got back to the hotel, I couldn't find parking nearby so I had to pay for parking. When I did find parking on the street (once) it was around the block behind the Braille Institute, which is the next building behind the hotel. The rooms are very quiet. I never heard a peep from the people next door, or from anyone passing by the room. However, the air conditioning unit was pretty loud. Everytime it kicked in, I had to turn up the volume on the t.v. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting the San Diego area even if you are not going to Legoland. We had a very pleasant stay and I would pick this hotel again if I return to San Diego.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed\u201d", "Author": "arthanial", "ReviewID": "UR26624431", "Content": "This is a great embassy suites.

Also, if you have a baby and need a crib, the hotel only has metal crib. Bring your own crib paddings - they don't suppy the bumper guards and they don't have Graco Pack and Play (which the ES in Flagstaff in AZ did). We didn't bring our bumperguard and had to use several sheets and packing tape to create one. The hotel atrium is beautiful and the koi pond was a favorite with the kids. Bring lots of quarters as it costs to get fish food to feed the fat fish. The breakfast is delicious as usual. Get there early as the lines get very long after 8am.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday (a kind of \"stay-cation\" if you will) for one night. I booked the room online through Embassy Suites' website and chose to purchase the \"Romance package\" in addition. The package included a bottle of champagne and a small box of See's candy. (I think it also came with robes and slippers, but I can't remember if that was standard or if it came with the package.) The price might seem a little high, but it was totally worth it. The boyfriend had no idea about the \"romance\" part and I wanted to keep it a surprise. I wrote special instructions when I made the reservation that I wanted the champagne already set up in the room when we arrived. Check-in was a breeze...the front desk clerk was very courteous and informative (those kind of manners seem to be almost non-existent these days) and told us about a complimentary happy hour in the lobby. They offered mixed drinks, wine, and beer, as much as you could drink from 5-7. We had a couple drinks and watched some football in the gorgeous atrium-like lobby. The room we were assigned was on the top floor, in the corner. It was immaculate and the view was incredible. Best of all, the champagne was on fresh ice and the chocolate and robes were all laid out. My boyfriend was so surprised he was almost in tears. I was ecstatic! I took him to dinner at The Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant in La Jolla, and we asked the valet guys to call us a cab. They offered to take us in their own hotel shuttle for free and even picked us up when we called after our meal! The pool was great, the spa stays open until midnight, and the sauna is exceptional.

Thought the setup was a little different since the bathroom was between the living room and the bedroom. Would have preferred having a door to the bedroom that would separate it from the bathroom and the living area instead of it being right after the living room. I had checked Trip Advisor before I went so was aware about the $17/day parking but also knew about the tip about parking on the street which we did every night we were there. There is definitely a lot of parking on the street by the entrance to the hotel and it is a very short walk to the entrance. And it was safe and also free! The front desk was very pleasant and helpful. We called ahead and was able to check in early so we could drop off our bags on our way to Sea World. Check-in was a breeze. The rooms were always clean and housekeeping was very quick when we asked for more towels and blankets. The indoor pool was a great plus and it helped that it closes at midnight after long days at the parks. When we asked about a Mexican restaurant, the concierge was very helpful and informative and he even had a card with printed directions to get to Old Town San Diego. It is a very short drive to Sea World and the San Diego Airport and even Legoland (30 minutes) since it is all on the highway. The breakfast was a great way to starting off the day. The omelets were delicious and the fresh fruits and such a variety of stuff to choose from was a much appreciated bonus of staying at the Embassy Suites. We all (kids included) loved, loved, loved the potatoes that they make there. And being able to bring it back to our room made it easier for our family since we have a couple of early risers and some late sleepers. The next time we are in the San Diego area, we will definitely stay at the Embassy Suites in La Jolla. It is close to the parks and La Jolla is such a nice area to stay in. There is a Trader Joe's and a Ralph's nearby and other food places to eat at in the area. As you can see we really enjoyed our stay. There was a business center with 3 computers and printers where you can access your email. The kids loved the 4 glass elevators and the koi ponds in the atrium.

There was classical music piped into the driveway entrance, bell hops ready for baggage assistance, and the lobby/decor was modern and upscale. Attrium was more open and trendy than the sometimes overgrown green houses of other ES's. Perhaps the limited foliage in the atrium allowed for more noise echoing, conveyed in some of the other reviews. Though, I didn't notice the noise up on the 9th floor. I always ask for an upper level floor to avoid the anticipated people traffic from the atrium, which they normally accomodate for HHonors members. Enroll free online. Overall service was professional, but seemed less personable. The rooms were just as impressive, with a flat panel HDTV in the living room, leather ottomans in both rooms, granite tops on everthing, nice modern decor. Room was very clean. Carpet seemed new. No funky smells/stains. ES breakfast buffet was reliably good, and despite the long lines it moved pretty fast (except for the cook to order line). Suggest getting to breakfast within 1.5hrs of opening to avoid long lines. This place is big ES with 12 floors of hungry guests. The styro plates were a little bit of a let down but perhaps it helped keep things moving. Unlike some other ES's, bussers did a decent job keeping up at this one. Managers reception was reliably good. No skimping on amount of alcohol, but available labels were typically mediocre. Hey, what do you expect for free. Pool was clean and area was well maintained. The only part I didn't like was the additional $17 parking fee and really tight / limited spaces. I wish I would've researched these reviews to get the tip on street parking. A more personable staff would've tipped me on to that. I also didn't get the usual, \"How's everything so far?\" evening call from the manager like at other ES's...guess I'm just spoiled. Kid traffic / noise was better than I expected for a Friday night stay. As with most ES's try to avoid weekends and book as a HHonor member. Would stay again if priced no higher than $175. I noticed the prices are really high ($245+) during the week.

You see I was woken up at 5:15AM by a brand new flat panel TV in the breakfast area blasting the news to all those suckers who happen to be sleeping on the sofa bed in the front room of the 2 room suite. If you have never stayed at an embassy suites they have an atrium that all rooms face so it's either really cool or really annoying depending on whether you are deaf or not. When I could no longer take the before dawn intrusion I did what most reasonable people would do, called the front desk. What I got is \"I will call and ask them to turn it down\" funny cause the lobby is what ,30 feet from the blaring TV. So I laid back down waiting for the peace and quite I expect at 5 in the morning. Gues what? someone turned it up. I must have cheesed them off by politely asking them to do, I don't know, their job maybe. I should be ashamed of myself for bothering them and just shut my yap, but funny thing is, I then got a bit mad. I called down again. \"I can still hear it\" \"sir I asked them to turn it down\" \"OK then why does it seem to be louder?\" \"(sigh) I will call them again\" Click. She hung up on me. I must have bothered her again I guess. So again I tucked myself under the cheesy velor blanket trying to recapture my dream. 15 minutes pass. No change in the volume. I heard every news story, every commercial, every Olympic fanfare (It was NBC). That was IT. I called again \"I will get dressed and go down there and turn it down myself\" Silence (from the front desk I could almost hear her thinking \"whatever\" ) Click she hung up on me again. So I get dressed and go on down (hey I was up on the 7th floor) and walked up to the offending TV. Not a single guest watching it. Just blasting to no one in particular. I see a staff member walking by and I ask \"can you help me turn this down\" and she barks at me \"we don't have the remote, we don't know how to do it\" and she walks away. What have I done to deserve this? I checked my breath and my zipper, my nose and my BO and I honestly don't know why I was getting them so upset. I was really really bothering them maybe I should just shut up go back to my room and pay my bill and leave them alone, you know give myself a time out. But hey, I am an adult, I have atayed at maybe 15 different ES and booked trade shows and meeting for a living so I am used to dealing with hotels. The good ones trya nd make their guest feel special, the bad ones, well read on. So, last chance, I walk up to the front desk \"Hi, I am the guy who called about the TV and the folks in the breakfast area says that they don't have the remote\" \"OK sir I just got here what is the problem\" so I repeat my sad tale and she say's to me \"what floor are you on?\" the 7th. She rolls her eyes in disbelief that I could hear it way up there. So she say's \"let me ask Ellen she took your call\" so she steps back and I hear some mumbling and she walsk back and says \"Sir Ellen turned it down herself she has the remote\" \"OK its still blasting, it's not down enough\" . \"Yes it is, sir it's our ploicy to turn the TV's on at 6AM and we can't do anything about it\" Now i am normaly a tolerant fellow who expects a bit of noise from other guest rooms (kids Tv's or just chatter from folks walking down the hall) but I surely did not exext to get \"attitude\" from the front desk for just asking them to turn down the volume. So I say to her \"It's 5:45, and I'ts been on for a while\" \"sir that's our policy, how long will you be with us\" \"One more night\" \"Sorry we can't help you\" I was flabbergassed. Why in the world would I make this stuff up. Do they seriously think I sit there at 5 AM waiting to complain about something. That I am making it all up or just over sensitive? Yes they do, yes they do because what happened next summed up the whole bitter exchange. I said to her \"I hope someone would please go over and listen to the volume\" Ellen never showed her face and her flunky just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. So I grabed one of those \"tell us how we are doing\" cards and said \"Someone is going to hear about this\" and as I walked away I heard her say under her breath \"stupid\" I turned around and said \"what di you say\" and she say's \"I said It's early\" [--] lady. I heard it correctly the first time. Remember I am the guy that can hear a TV from seven stories up. She never checked it out, never smiled or acknowleged my concern and gte theis, as i walked away she called me STUPID. Thanks Ellen, Thanks rude employee who barked at me in the lounge \"we don't know how to do it\" and a big thank you to the front desk clerk who rolled her eyes ignored my reasonable request and called me stupid. Fianlly a big thank you to Embassy Suites La Jolla. I will never forget you. You know just how to treat your guest, Like [--]. Wow,and it only took me 229.00 to figure it out.

PARKING! 17 dollars a day are they serious? word to the wise PARK ON THE STREET. Its free and a short walk to the hotel. Everyday I laughed at the poor suckers who paid to park there. One night we parked on the street right in front of the hotel, I seen a family coming out of the parking complex. We got to the hotel at the same time they did. Even though they paid 17 dollars they still had to walk about a city block to get to the hotel. We paid nothing and got the same convience they did.

On the weekend the hotel was full of kids there for a soccer tournament so it was quite lively, but we never had any issues with them. During the week it was extremely relaxing at this hotel. My little boy loved the koi pond, and the breakfast was excellent and saved a lot of time and money. In the evenings he enjoyed the pretzels and goldfish, then after he was in bed my husband or I would run down for a cocktail or a glass of wine. Having the separate bedroom was a lifesaver for us, as we could put him to bed in the bedroom, then stay in the living room and watch basketball on the awesome plasma TV. The rooms are decorated quite nicely, and I appreciated that the bedspreads seemed easily washable and very clean! We also enjoyed the indoor pool - though it is small it was never crowded, even during the busy family weekends. I liked the fact that it was out of the sun, since we spent most of our days outside. My toddler would wake up each day and the first words out of his mouth were always 'the pool!' Now we have been home a few days and if I ask him if he had fun on vacation he grins and says 'the pool!' He also loved the glass elevators and being able to look down on the people and fish in the atrium. The computer room was also extremely convenient for us to be able to run down and check our email, and we never had to wait for a computer, even on the busy days. It was also great having the big mall across the street. This is a great location - very centrally located to anywhere around San Diego you would want to go. The only tiny downside to this hotel has been mentioned before - the parking. More often than not we couldn't get our keycard to work, a minor annoyance but an annoyance nonetheless. It is also a little awkward getting out of the garage once you're parked. I think the $17 charge is more than made up for by the breakfast and drinks at night though.

It is a great location, a quiet business district and has easy access from the airport and super easy access to the freeways. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport in San Diego and it was really easy to find. We made our reservations through a popular internet hotel site and had printed our reservation to prove it, but when we checked in, they had no record of our reservation. But, they were very quick to fix it, we kept our great internet rate (VERY good rate, I think $160) and we were checked in and on our way to the room within 5 minutes. The hotel lobby is really pretty with lots of foilage and beautiful koi ponds. If you're familiar with Embassy hotels, you'll know that most of them have the same open floorplan where all rooms face out to an open atrium with some kind of trees/water. Our room was very nice and had everything that we expected it would have. These rooms are all suites, so they all have a separate living and sleeping area, connected with a little hallway. The livingroom had a sleeper sofa, chair/ottoman, dining table that doubled as a desk, flat screen tv, internet, game system on the tv, and a coffee table/leather ottoman (which is nice if you have toddlers who like to fall and hit their heads on standard wooden/glass coffee tables like we do. :-) ) The hallway has a bar sink, coffee pot with mugs and all of the makings for morning coffee and tea. Across the little hallway is a closet that opens to a mini kitchen. There is a microwave, mini fridge, ice bucket, corkscrew/bottle opener and glasses. The bathroom was large and clean and had nice toiletries and a hairdryer, the only odd thing was the way the door opened wide out, but that is minor, really. Across from the bathroom was a full sized closet with mirrored doors. There is also an iron/board in the closet. The bedroom had a king size bed with nice linens and tons of pillows. We also had a dresser, flat screen tv and nightstands. The bedroom is in the back, away from the hallway and was very quiet. The view was of the parking garage, but that was okay, as we didn't book this hotel for great views. If you want a great view, stay somewhere on the beach. :-) There seemed to be lots of kids and families around the hotel, but it was still very quiet. We never heard anything in our room and slept very soundly. Our daugher loved the koi pond in the lobby. They have some HUGE koi, with nice waterfalls and have even installed a little machine that you can get a handful of koi food to feed the fish for a quarter, which was a big hit with our little one. The breakfasts are great and there is everything you could ever imagine to eat! There is everything from made to order omlettes, bacon/sausage, eggs, pancakes, yogurt, fruit, toast, muffins, oatmeal, coffee, juice......you name it, they have it!! We loved the breakfasts! They have lots of tables set up in the courtyard to take your breakfast at, or you can take a tray to your room, if you'd rather. We never had trouble finding a table, as some previous reviewers stated, nor did we find it overcrowded or the lines long. There are ony two complaints that I would have about this hotel. One is that the parking is really hard to come by and they do charge you for it. We didn't mind the charges so much, as we expected it after reading other reviews, but we didn't realize how few parking spaces there are available. We would come in quite late after spending the day at Disneyland and have a tough time finding a parking spot, which is not what you want to do after you've already driven for over an hour to get to your hotel. When you pay for parking, you expect to not have trouble finding a spot. The other complaint I would have are the elevators. When we checked out on Monday morning, we had to wait *forever* to take the elevator down to the lobby. Had we not been on the 8th floor with a toddler, I would have just walked and would have gotten there much quicker! It seemed that every elevator that stopped at our floor was already full of people on their way to the lobby to check out. A minor thing, really...but, annoying nonetheless. All in all, this is a great hotel!! We couldn't have asked for more, especially for the price we paid. It was perfect. Also, the concierge was really good, they made our reservations on a shuttle to the airport that was really reasonable and right on time. They worked hard to get us all of the info and at the airport on time, it was much appreciated. We will definitely stay here again in the future and would definitely recommend it to anyone on business in San Diego or to families looking for a great base to enjoy Southern California!", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cKind and Attentive Service\u201d", "Author": "CMFM", "ReviewID": "UR10087893", "Content": "Our thanks and appreciation to the staff at the Embassy Suites, La Jolla for a wonderful stay. Our family (six rooms worth) came together from throughout California for a 3 day weekend wedding event in La Jolla and we were able to make ourselves at home and have a great time in large part due to the kindness and attention of the Embassy Suites staff. Check in was efficient and welcoming and all of our rooms were ready, clean and comfortable. The front desk made sure my father (who is disabled),was appropriately accomodated. We enjoyed the breakfasts all together and though we were a large noisy group, the staff was cheerful and friendly also taking the time to visit with my father who wanted to show off his family. When we were racing out to the wedding location on Sunday morning, the concierge (Adam?) was extremely helpful in making an adjustment in our handicapped parking assignment, helped with loading Dad's wheel chair and walker and even printed out a map to the wedding location which saved us from getting lost on the way (like my brother :). This same young man also helped my parents considerably when they checked out the next day. There is a great business center that we used for some last minute communications and a convenient kiosk in the lobby to print boarding passes. Some of the family enjoyed the nice pool and steam room. Parking is a challenge if you mind paying $17 per day (ouch) - it is in the heart of an expensive area so it is understandable, but it can add up. Very nice upscale shopping across the street and down the road about a mile or two, more shopping (Trader Joes and Whole Foods) if you are staying longer and want to eat in. Unlike some ES locations, the acoustics here are very good, we did not hear much noise from the atrium/breakfast area (whether you were on 3rd, 5th 7th or 11th floor like we were). And the rooms were very quiet as well. I was encouraged by the other positive comments on this thread and my expectations were met and then some.

Upon walking into the room, there was Living Room Area with a pull out sofa bed, a large ottoman, a comfy chair, a table with 3 chairs and a flat screen tv. Moving further into the suite there was a bi-fold door and behind that was a microwave, small re-frig and a counter top to prepare and store snacks. On the opposite wall was a bar with a coffee maker, ice bucket and a sink.................there was even a cupboard below for storage of snacks etc. as well. You then go through a door, and to the left was a roomy and very nice bathroom with a tub/shower combo, a hairdryer and stocked with towels and toiletries. To the right, across from the bathroom, was a large closet with mirrored doors, there was a shelf & rod for clothes, a suitcase valet, and an iron& ironing board. At the end of that hall was the bedroom, with 2 double beds, my husband and I had one bed and our 3 and 5 year old boys shared the other bed, there was a dresser/vanity with an ottoman. On the other end of the dresser was a flat screen tv. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful with many choices, cereal, friut, pastries, bagels, donuts, yougurt, juice coffee and best of all the hot breakfast bar. Grab a small bowl and choose your own ingredients, hand it to the chef and they make it into a scramble or omelett, you also can have pancakes, french toast, bacon & sausage. We too enjoyed the complimentary late afternoon/evening manager's happy hour. Crackers, chips, salsa, drinks with or without alcohol. The pool was nice, but could get a little noisy when there was more than 1-2 families with kids at a time.........Not all parents were good about keeping their children from making to much noise, or hogging the entire pool. Three suggestions would have made the stay better: Bigger Beds Better Parking Rates - $17 a day was steep Cable TV - only had the East Coast Feed for the Kids channels, not good considering you are having fun in the sun all-day and then want the kids to settle down..........and their programing is already over by 3pm, because it was the East Coast Feed.

The one thing that marred our stay was the terrible behaviour of their wait and cooking staff at breakfast. During check in, we had asked about breakfast hours. We were informed that it was from 6-9am and that as long as we got there a little before 9am, we would be able to enjoy the buffet till past 9. Taking these words to heart, we went down at 8.50am (we were on vacation!!) and stood in line to get our cooked food. 9am came along and in the blink of an eye, the line for cooked food was shut off, the shutters to the kitchen came down, the cold food including fruit, bread and cereal were cleared. Even plates were taken away. My niece asked the staff for an apple (he had just cleared it and placed the basket of apples on his trolley right in front of him) and he refused!!! The staff told her that breakfast closes at 9am and so she could not have the apple! I can accept the cooked food station closing on time but most decent hotels, leave the cold food for at 15-20 mins before shutting it down. Also, they will inform diners that the buffet is closing. Nothing of this sort happened at the Embassy Suites. I guess that Embassy Suites is just a good hotel wannabe, that has not quite succeeded. Anyway, quite appalled by this, I went to the speak to the front desk to give feedback, only to be told \"That's just the way it is here. Breakfast shuts down at 9am\". I'm not sure if our feedback reached management, because the next morning, the Food and Beverage manager was present at breakfast, and this time, the cold food buffet stayed open about 10 minutes past nine.

Nice restaurants in the area, but most are off the main street so ask or know where you are heading--you will have a hard time if you just try to find something while driving around.

The managers reception is a nice benefit and the staff, as usual, is quite friendly. Being a two week resident, I appreciate the free laundry on several floors of the hotel. It allows me to pack light if I choose, and do my laundry conveniently near my guest room. The restaurant staff is very friendly and ready to see that your food and service meets the high standards that have come to be known worldwide with Embassy Suites. The staff that takes care of my conference needs are the best. They check in daily to ensure all my needs are met. Relating to the indoor property, my wife once said, \"this is one hotel where if it were raining all day you would not be disappointed being trapped inside\". If you have ever been to an embassy suites, you know exactly what we mean. The location of the property is perfect with top name dining within walking distance, one of the largest malls across the street and the beautiful beaches of San Diego minutes drive west. With all of the upgrades in rooms, and public meeting areas going on in 2007, I can't imaging a more ideal property for the family, business person, or group event.

The housekeeping department are adept at doing an efficient job and seldom being seen, but when you do it is always with a smile and a warm hello. I have seen a great improvement in the restaurant staff in the past visits, They have joined the team effort that permiates the rest of the building. The bartender is great and friendly, constantly looking out for the comfort of the customer. The new look of the rooms is great, first class all the way.

I am actually going to order the pillows online - same ones - yeah. The hotel is super clean! The linens, carpet, everything - but it is brand new remodel for the most part - so that is great. The breakfast was excellent - just be advised to get up early - if you arrive at 8:30 for breakfast there is a huge line - so we went down at around 7 and no line for fresh made to order breakfast. The atrium is beautiful and the the koi pond is great to look at - the atmosphere is wonderful too. We ate at the PF Changs that is right next door so that made for an easy dinner - and that PF Changs is awesome. The parking costs money - but I didn't mind paying for the convenience of actually having easy parking in the garage. I will definitely stay at this hotel on my next trip - it's so easy to get to every place we went to on our 4 day stay - and that includes Sea World, Wild Animal Park, Old Town, and Coronado.

This one seems fancy at first glance...nice atrium, ritzy town, etc. But the happy hour snacks and breakfast were sub par to other Embassys...guess each hotel puts out what it wants. Just chips and salsa, not even veggies which Oxnard always serves. Had taquitos in SLO. No make your own waffles like in Oxnard and Monterey. They don't even sautee the veggies for the omelette, just slap in some egg and served to you. They just started renovating this hotel, the 3rd and 4th floors were completely closed. I was not told when I made the reservation on ES but was told at check-in. Probably was not a problem unless you were planning on spending lots of time in your room, but Sat. AM we were awakened by hammering sounds at 8 am. Thought that was inappropriate, and was just pissed that I wasn't told at reservation time. I think that is sneaky!! Ditto on the room arrangement. Bedroom nice size but the living area is small and the microwave and fridge blocks hallway if you want in. There are always doors swinging and blocking someone. We asked to switch rooms, as we had one on opposite side of elevators, which bedroom window overlooked large A/C compressor and main street. They offered to move us from 7th to 11th floor, but with same side of bldg did not seem worth it. As it turned out, the A/C and fan in the room makes a lot of noise and blocked whatever street noise we were anticipating. $15/night for parking is a ripoff, but I guess parking is tight in this rich town. ALso, the bellhop nearly rushed us at the door. Frankly I prefer to take the cart and do it myself, but guess they don't want to be screwed out of a tip. Kids liked the pool, but it is small. Would have been nice if they had a pool table or video game room like Monterey. My kids loved it there! Actually, Seaside, adjacent to Monterey. All in all we like this chain because of the freebies and the private bedroom. Oh yeah, usually in Embassys you can bring your own DVD or video game systems, and just plug in to the TV through the A/V inputs, but in this hotel, they have deactivated the inputs. They want you to pay for movies and games. I expect that in other hotels, but most other Embassys I have done this so I was disappointed.

We were very pleased with our choice. The design of the facility is similar to other large Embassy Suites (eg. Chicago). Very dramatic lobby and interior and great suite rooms. The ES suites arrangement always seem very generous to me in comparison to most other hotels. The entire facility was clean and well maintained. Service was very attentive. Location is convenient - it's on a major travel road and across from a large mall. Convenient to La Jolla village, Scripps aquarium and Route 5. Parking is slightly extra but very convenient with an adjacent indoor garage. Embassy provides good value with an excellent breakfast as well as a nice complimentary cocktail hour with snacks (salsa and chips, etc).

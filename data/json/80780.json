What a surprise to find that although the hotel was quite full, there was nevertheless a lovely laid-back air to the place. Our room was quiet, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the food in the adjacent restaurant very good indeed. The restaurant staff were delightful (particularly Nick) and the hotel is situated very conveniently for public transport - the best way to travel in San Fancisco. (It's a short walk to the cable car to downtown and a bus stop is directly across the road). The airport shuttle was also convenient to arrange.

Elevators were working fine, but they had to post signs as to where to get off to get to the \"lobby.\" The wine hour was nice, but I was a little upset that I had to go back up to my room to get my ID. Don't you have to be 21 to get a hotel room anyway? They did put out some little pizzas, which was a nice addition to the wine. No breakfast in the am, which is disappointing, but they did offer different coffees, teas, water, and mimosas, so that was a nice added touch, but not good on an empty stomach. What really gets me is the $44 a day parking! YIKES!!!

As previously stated the hotel lobby was under renovation, but they had a temporary lobby set up in the ball room. We did have to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs, but there were many there who volunteered to help. We were given a room on the first floor which seemed to be fine, except that if street noise bother's you the outside rooms have windows that are against the sidewalk and street thus making it slightly noisy during the night. We were in Room 123 and although we did get over the street noise, the room was right next to the lobby that was under renovation. There was only a plastic cover in what I assume must have once been the door. This cause us 2 problems the following morning. First, they were working on tearing up the old flooring and by about 8:30 in the morning they were running loud machinery in order to do this. It was so loud in our room that we could not hear each other speak or hear the television. It is a good thing that we were on East coast time and that we didn't want to come back to the room mid-day to relax. Secondly, the dust that was produced from the work easily came in through the plastic cover over the hole where the lobby door use to be. The man working at the front desk that morning was more than willing to let us switch rooms, but with all of our stuff already strewn about in the room I felt this was an inconvenience. He did offer us breakfast for the two mornings of our stay in the hotel restaurant which was a very nice thing to do. I felt that the room was a nice size, nicely furnished, and overall the staff was wonderful. However, the fact is that I feel the rooms near the construction should not have been given to anyone unless it was at a reduced rate and that the customers are given prior warning as to what they may encounter. We had no warning that it would be that loud when we were given the room and we were paying the same amount as others staying on a higher floor, away from both the street and construction noise. If the construction noise and issues had not occurred I would rank the hotel as a nice one, but I felt we were taken advantage of by being given this room that even the desk clerk cringed at the next morning when I told him which room I was complaining about.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rolling Meadows, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!\u201d", "Author": "sandy t", "ReviewID": "UR127198147", "Content": "Service was excellent!

I was there to visit Coit Tower, the Cable Car Museum, Chinatown, Pier 39, Ghiradelli, and Alcatraz. Upon arrival you drive up to the entrance where a valet person will park the car yourself. There's no self-parking as it's all valet. By the way, it's $44 a day. The reservation clerk greeted us with a smile and explained everything to me before checking in. She gave me the room I requested. I stayed on the top floor. Upon entering the room I noticed how nicely it was decorated. The room is contemporary looking. One side of the wall was mirrored, which made the room look bigger. What I didn't like about the hotel: 1) The Bed. It was pretty flimsy. Woke up with a neck ache. Good thing I bought Bengay with me. Plus, the location of the bed was so close to the entrance and right across from the bathroom. I think it would have been better if they moved the bed closer to the window. 2) Toilet. You had to hold on to the flush otherwise it doesn't flush. 3) Bathroom. I actually have no problem with the bathroom overall but the light switch controlled the light inside the bathroom and outside. So when you wake up in the middle of the night to use the toilet you turn the light on and it shines right to the room, waking up your partner. 4) Air Conditioner. It worked but in the middle of the night it was a bit muggy. It started working again in the wee morning hours. 5) Check Out. Took a long time. Had two other people ahead of me and only one clerk. I think I waited a good 7-10 minutes just to get my receipt and turn in my keys. 6) Parking. $44 a night was a bit steep I think. What I like? 1) Staff.

We have stayed in different locations there. Tuscan Inn Fisherman's Wharf is one of the nicest and most pleasant places we have ever stayed when traveling-anywhere. We also felt this to be one of the safer areas for night walking when staying in Sn Francisco. We would gladly stay at Tuscan Inn again. The Tuscan Inn manager is Ed Sincoff. We met Ed for the first time when we stayed there recently. Ed is a very nice and capable businessman. I found Ed to be running a really nice hotel and learned he was respected by those who work for him. Jose is the gentleman at the front desk who I seemed to reach most often when I phoned the Inn. Jose and the numerous fellow staff people, I discovered, are very friendly and knowledgable. I noticed among everyone from clerks to cleaning people, to parking valets, all seemed to be enjoying their jobs at the Tuscan Inn and sharing San Francisco with visitors. Tuscan Inn is a larger, yet quaint, hotel centrally located in the Fisherman Wharf area of San Francisco. From the standpoint of the physical rooms, we choose upgraded rooms allowing us a bedroom seperated from the living room. This allowed privacy for office work, and privacy to enjoy the second LCD TV. The king bed was great- soft enough to be comfy and firm enough to allow wonderful sleep. While we were there I slept through the 4.0 earthquake. (Great bed!) The bath was a larger comfortable size, and had marble. The shower was wonderful with a lot of hot water and excellent pressure. The bath had an exhause fan. The room was clean and inviting. There were plenty of windows and they opened for ventilation. The heat/AC units were very efficent. The hotel itself is undergoing lobby renovation which may be done as of this writing. The new marble outside the building entry is very beautiful, as will be the new details being finished in the building lobby. There are two elevators, both with ample room. We seemingly never had to wait more than seconds for the elevator to arrive. The hotel does have a free coffee/tea bar in the mornings, and a managers free wine tasting each evening. The hotel has a nicer restaurant located in its building just feet from the entry. Plus the Fisherman Wharf area has all types of food, in all price ranges within walking distance any direction. (You must try the sour dough bread for breakfest Just two blocks onto the wharf. It is delicious!) If you need any supplies while at the Inn, there is a major drug store one-minute away on a neighboring block, and a Trader Joe grocery two-minutes walk on another street. I did see airport vans stopping at the Tuscan Inn. Plus Cable cars, retro trolley cars, regular large city buses and taxis are available within brief minutes of the Inn. For this reason your car is not necessary in the wharf area and can be cumbersome in most of San Francisco. But if you do have your car Tuscan Inn has a parking garage on premesis. Be aware, parking in San Francisco is not cheap-anywhere! If you are adventuresome and want to play ticket roulete with the meter people, you can park free overnight-until 7AM on many meters in the wharf area. But do read all parking signs carefully. There are more than 40 ways to get a parking ticket in SF. If you enjoy walking, Alcatraz tour boats are walkable from the Inn. If you want to sight see, why not walk to the Powell-Market street trolley and ride it across the city, and change cable cars to go yet another direction. Then on the way back, get off the cable car in China Town. Enjoy yourself shopping and sight seeing and then walk back down the hill to Tuscan Inn. By then you will understand why my family believed Tuscan Inn is one of the best places to stay in San Francisco.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, excellent service, dated property\u201d", "Author": "Shaunr52", "ReviewID": "UR126023893", "Content": "Once lobby and room renovations are completed, this hotel will likely be a 4+ property.

The \"lobby\" during our stay was a conference room. Not exactly the welcoming scene with the fireplace and coziness I expected to see. How about a mention about the renovations on the website that touts the \"ambiance\" of this lobby so the guest can decide if they want to stay on a construction site ? Or do what other hotels do and reduce your room rate a few percent for the guest who arrives expecting what they were shown on the website? And why \"two buck chuck\" for the wine reception when you are so close to Napa? There must be another inexpensive wine option? We stayed in a \"renovated\" room that was 300 sq. ft at best, tiny double beds, view of an alley, no screen on the window, and crappy mattresses and pillows.

The nautical theme is a nice touch, and the place is quiet even if you face the street. I would certainly come again. The room had a clean, cozy feel, and we were given a king facing Mason St. after being stuck in a queen room facing an airshaft. The staff was fine, if not super friendly -- the place is really busy, so they seem somewhat distracted. This place is run by Kimpton, but it truly feels more like a Best Western (you don't get Kimpton points, only BW). It is standard, not luxurious. Some things were not so good. The bathroom products sucked, and so did the bathroom itself. The bed was just ok, and the pillows weak. The TV was not the best, though supposedly new. But I found the room relaxing. The street (North Point) in front is busy, but still fairly quiet, especially at night. Parking is easy to find on the street, so no need to valet. You just need to put money in the meter from early in the morning (7am), and watch the no-parking hours (middle of the night) because the days change depending on the location. Within a few blocks are a Walgreens, a Chase bank, a Safeway and a Trader Joe's. Pat's Cafe is a good local brunch place on Taylor, and Hollywood Cafe down the block was busy for brunch though we didn't try it. Overall, there are not so many good restaurants close by, but the area is really convenient to North Beach, and you can catch a bus or cab to Chinatown, Polk St., Russian Hill, Nob Hill, and the Marina. Telegraph Hill is walkable -- we saw Coit Tower from our room. Taxis were easy to find, since Fisherman's Wharf is so close.

I attempted to call down to the valet to have our car brought around three times. No answer. We proceeded to the front desk to check out. The gentleman at the front desk radioed the valet to have our car brought around. We waited and waited. I saw many other people getting their cars who came well after us. I had to go to the valet again and give him our car number. We again waited and waited. I had to give our car number to another valet who finally brought our car around. We waited 40 minutes to get our car. The hotel needs to improve the efficiency of it's valet staff or hire more valets to be on site during the morning hours.

There were some negatives but it seemed for such a high rating and hotel price it would be good. I was so wrong. We stayed in several Best Westerns on on this trip and this was by far the most expensive; double and even triple the price. We paid $200 for the room and expected alot. We got nothing. First you can't park your own car, it's valet only so when you first come in you have hand over money for the valet and bellman. Second right away you pay parking. We paid over $100 for a the stay. So before we even got in our room you are up to $300. The staff was nice and prompt, I give them that. We get to our room and its TINY. The room has has cheap tacky decor. We had a window and we opened the shades we get a brick wall. Double tacky. On our nightstands were bottles of water they advertised for $6, I find this really really tacky. The room had flaws like wallpaper coming off in the bathroom and grout that needed to be fixed. Also there is no breakfast. But they sure did advertise for a restaurant next door in which they offered cold cereal, yogurt and juice for $12. Really are people that insane that they think that is acceptable price for that? The only thing good about the room was the comforter, linens and mattress were better than other hotels. The location is okay, there are hotels closer to the pier and we had to walk several blocks to reach hot spots. I see nothing good about this hotel. I stayed at another BW which had full hot breakfast, bigger rooms, great views and was much cheaper.

A 4x4 pizza is close to $30. Room maintenance crew doesn't replace coffe and sugar packs if you open it. Also they don't replace your tiny shampoo and conditioner bottles and don't even offers a tiny lotion bottle, where in most hotels that is standard. There were other things that shocked me with this hotel but the most important thing for you is that you watch for your credit card once given to the hotel. They will automatically hold about 10% to 20% of your money in addition to what they will charge for the room, in case you decide to use any items inside the refrigerator, room service, watch movies, etc., even if you don't use anything from their premises they will take the money out of your credit card regardless.

This wasnt from outside noise, considering the location the noise level from the streets was very low - i did request a high, quiet room though. However, the fridge and air con sounded like jumbo jets!! It kept me awake every night, I couldnt use the air con as it was just too loud. The storage was minimal with 2 drawers and a small wardobe that the doors were falling off of.. The products available in the rooms are basic and cheap, bar of soap anyone? not as described on the website. The minbar was expensive but I think most places are, I bought wine and snacks at the Safeway which is located just across the street and kept that in my room - a bottle of wine here was 4 dollars!!!! In the minibar a small bottle was 16... The thing that started my slip into slight negativity was upon arrival I was asked for a card so he could charge 500 dollars to it as insurance. WHAT?? I was not made aware of this before, after paying for the holiday 500 dollars was not something I had readily available, apart from my spending money of course! I didnt even have a credit card with me to do this, just a debit and will have a hefty charge from my bank for the exchange, fab.

The concierge was very helpful with transport questions I had and the doormen always say hello. Jose checked me out at the end of my stay and he was abrupt and not as friendly as Keith. Housekeeping were brilliant, always happy and did a good job. Although one day I put my 'do not distrub' sign up.. They then phoned me to ask if i wanted my room serviced...

The staff was very helpful and always friendly. Every time I saw a staff member they greeted me happily. Perks: Coffee and tea service every morning in the lobby, Wine reception every evening (5-6pm) in the lobby. Free Wi-fi.

We had an inner view which was a quieter room but we seemed to look onto someone's apartment so our shutters were closed the whole time. The interactions we had with various staff were very good. The concierge Jackie was excellent and gave a lot of helpful advice. We also had to ask for help with various issues (smoke detector, extra hangers, fridge, and thermostat), and the staff was quick to respond and helpful. The hotel wasn't cheap, but seems to be on par with San Francisco prices. Overall, great: staff/service, location, daily wine tasting, Jackie the concierge.

We participated in the FLEET WEEK activities, my husband is a WWII veteran and had spent a considerable amount of time in SFO during the war, but this was my first visit and I was very excited, but quickly became disenchanted. Our room, the size of a broom closet was on the first floor and our view was a blank wall. It was almost like a garden apartment. We asked to be moved to a higher room but were told nothing else was availble. A $299/night view of a wall was very upsetting. Not at all what what I had expected In addition to the high room rate, we were also billed $44/night for parking. Which probably should have been $42, but the amount had been crossed out in been and $44 written in. I assumed they were penalizing FLEET WEEK guests. We couldn't get the thermostat in our room to function properly, it was very complicated, so the first night we were very cold and unable to get anything but cold air blowing. The first morning we woke up, we were in a hurry to get to the dock to cruise on the Jeremiah O'Brien. Didn't have much time but when I went to dry my hair, I could not locate a dryer. I called housekeeping and got voicemail, so I called the front desk and they told me they would get a hair dryer to me as quickly as possible. They did, it only took about 15 minutes, but I shouldn't have had to ask for one. Before we left we asked to have the heating system looked at in our room as we did not feel it was working properly and we had been very cold during the night. Upon our return, we had a message from engineering telling us to call them when we returned and they would show us how to operate the thermostat. After the engineer was in our room for over 20 minutes, he couldn't figure out why it wasn't working but if we had any more trouble, he would be there until 11 PM, it was already 10 PM. Needless to say, it was another cold night. Also, when we had checked in on Friday, we were informed that there was going to be a neighborhood festival on Sunday and that we would be stuck at the hotel for 12 hours unless we left first thing in the morning and came back later than night. They also advised we would not be able to get our car out of the garage during that time because all of the roads around the hotel would be blocked off or jammed up with traffic. We had enough. It felt more like punishment than pleasure having to stay at this Best Western. So, Sunday morning we packed up early, went down to the front desk and told them they were checking out. I was informed they were going to charge us $75 for leaving early. They were more worried about getting their $75 than why we were leaving. After explaing to the desk clerk why we were leaving, she did agree to waive the $75 fee. In addition to the $299 rate, the $44 parking fee and the misc. taxes and fees, our daily charge for this hotel was almost $380. We were able to relocate to the Holiday Inn Express at SFO Airport, and for $150/night we had a beautiful room overlooking the Bay, free parking and about half the misc. taxes than what we had paid downtown. Plus we got free breakfast and a clean WARM room with a working thermostat.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campbell, Ca", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and noisey!\u201d", "Author": "Murano47", "ReviewID": "UR119153613", "Content": "Spent one night here in Room 419.

(Plus, the place we stayed last time, Fairmont Ghiradelli cost $600+/night now.) Tuscan Inn didn't let us down. Why we loved this place: 1. Location - Tuscan Inn is located in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf. It was so convenient to walk everywhere ... Fisherman's Wharf eateries, shopping, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, cable cars, Ferry Building, downtown, etc. Getting to/from Napa/Sonoma was a breeze. 2. Rental Car - We needed a rental car for just 1 day (during the day) and didn't want to pay for overnight parking. Both Budget and Dollar are right next door. 3. Cost - it was the cheapest 3-star hotel in Fisherman's Wharf, and it even included a nightly wine reception. 4. Clean - While the rooms are a bit dated (i.e., peeling wall paper, tube TV, a little rust in the shower, worn towels, etc.), the room was spotless. Every day we could count on housekeeping cleaning our room and bringing clean, fresh towels. 5. Comfort - Aside from the occassional street noise, the room we received was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. My husband and I had some of the best sleep/naps ever. 6. Service - From the valet to the reception to housekeeping, everyone met us with a smile and hello. Tips: 1. Arrive early to the wine reception or you will NOT get any hors d'ouerves. 2. Turn your A/C or heat to low to avoid the loud \"kapow\" when the unit kicks on. 3. Except where marked for cleaning, you can park on the streets at Fisherman's Wharf for FREE between 7 pm - 7 am. 4.

We were a little hesitant at first as some of the reviews on here are not full of praise. However, we are very glad that we followed our instincts because this is a fantastic little hotel and we could not fault it! We arrived at 1pm and although check-in wasn't until 3pm we were able to go to our room straight away. The guy on the desk was extremely helpful and made us feel very welcome, providing us with exact instructions on how to get to AT&T Park that night for the baseball game that we had tickets for. Our room was small but perfectly well equipped, spotlessly clean and was well decorated, with a great looking bathroom. There was a coffee maker and complimentary toiletries. There is a minibar but as is always the case in hotels, the prices are ridiculous, but we used it as a fridge to keep our own drinks in. We had not expected to get breakfast included as we had booked the hotel as room only, but were given a free continental voucher for each of our three mornings which was great. This is waiter service and had a choice of tea, coffee, juices, muffin, crossiant, or toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries. You could also choose to upgrade to other items at half price. Although we enjoyed this breakfast (as it was an unexpected freebie!) we're not sure we could have been happy to pay $12 for it as it wasn't very big. There is a Safeway and Walgreens within one block of the hotel, so we could easily have picked up something else for breakfast, and there are a couple of other cafes we saw within a block also. The hotel is VERY well located, just a five minute walk from Pier 39, but set back enough to be quiet and not feel too touristy. The hotel can booked transfers too and from SFO airport which we used on our return instead of getting a taxi, saving us $15, and was very efficient. We did a good job at getting out and about while we were in San Fran. We got a 48hr bus tour ticket which took us all over the city and across the Golden Gate Bridge. We went to watch the Giants at AT&T. We took a half day trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito (booked before we travelled with Viator). As in many US cities the food seems to be either burgers or high-end restaurants, with a number of Clam Chowder restaurants in San Fran. We would highly recommend Knuckles Bar at the Hyatt on North Point. This is supposed to be a sports bar but more like a good mid-range restaurant with reasonably priced, good quality food.

It's one of those places you have to see... After driving from Monterey, we were glad to pull up outside the Hotel, and looked forward to staying in a Best Western after having good experiences with this Hotel Chain so far on our Road Trip... We went in and were greeted by a friendly guy and allocated our rooms... All good so far... Clean rooms, comfy beds, the Hotel seemed nice and we were RIGHT BESIDE Fisherman's Wharf... Fisherman's Wharf is a nice place to walk around and take it all in... Driving around San Fran in the rental car was fun.. The steep streets and the iconic views really were a sight to behold... Very enjoyable... The first night there and we went down to the wine reception in the lobby... Quite nice, but not as great as some reviews make out... Some people chatting together, some people taking advantage of the free wine and drinking as much as possible... That night we hit the town... We went to an Irish bar that was close to little Italy, where a \"honey trap\" which was employed by the bar in my opinion, tried to get us to drink and eat as much as possible and also tried to land us with her bill too... It didn't work out too well for her or the pub, and she should have thought twice before trying to pull the wool over the eyes of a couple of Irish people who couldn't be bothered with her tripe talk... She was told where to go... I think she was used to getting her way with most travellers... So I hope she enjoyed the plates of uneaten food she ordered and stacks of drinks. We went to Shanghai Kelly's pub after that, and met an Irish guy that had been living there for 16 years... He told us that it was common enough, and our suspicions were likely correct... So... Back to the Hotel... We drank our fill, and I ended up in the Hotel room before my wife and my friend as they stayed outside for a cigarette... I was not asked to produce any ID... After 2 mins I had fallen asleep! After a very long time, I eventually woke up to my mobile phone ringing... I had been drinking after all, and it was a long day of travelling... My wife was downstairs with my friend and they would not allow them to go to up the room... Since it was my credit card paid the deposit, they wanted my ID. My wife and friend, both very friendly people, had asked for them to wake me, or let my friend into his room (adjoining to ours) where he could provide proof that they were guests... The room was in his name and he showed his ID, but once again, since my credit card paid the security deposit, they wanted my ID??? The Chinese girl that was working at the front desk wanted proof that they were guests before letting them even go into the elevator... Ok, I understand they don't want people coming off the streets posing as guests... ... But after failing to wake me via the room phone, they could have had security escort one of them up and into either my room or my friends room... Is it THAT INCONCEIVABLE that your husband may have fallen asleep in the room?... IS THERE NO OTHER WAY to check other than insist that I MUST answer the phone and come down with ID?... They gave my name and room number and my wife showed her Irish ID with her married name and it still wants enough... The other room was in my friends name, and he showed his ID, but because my credit card paid the deposit they refused to accept it... The room is in his name!... He's showing you his ID! When I finally showed up after 45 minutes of my wife and friend pleading with them, although we had drink in us, I could tell she was on a power trip... Its such a pity... Even AFTER I showed my ID, we were only then escorted to the room by security to show MORE EVIDENCE that we were guests... He was a nice man, and said he was just doing what he was told... There were plenty of other ways to deal with this, and there was no need to escort us up to prove again, after I showed my ID... My friend had ID and his room was in his name, and my wife had ID, and was the only other guests from Ireland with the same surname as me and she knew my name and room number etc etc etc... Common sense.. My wife was cold, tired and upset... It ruined a nice stay at a decent hotel... that particular member of staff was on a power trip and was a rude and horrible person... I complained the next day, and a friendly man at the front desk explained security etc... He had been made aware of the whole scenario, obviously warned to expect a complaint, or just told during chit chat... I'm not stupid and I understand to a certain extent the policies that must be enforced, but working in sales and customer service myself, that particular member of staff was rude, unhelpful, and made me regret paying my hard earned money to stay there, only for my wife to be treated like a junkie that walked in off the street... They even said the next day that my wife was intoxicated and that's why they were so adamant that she prove they were guests! How dare they... We are on holidays enjoying ourselves!... She was not abusive and everything she said made perfect sense... I am appalled, and I intend to make a formal complaint... for all the good it will do!... But maybe they keep a close eye on the jobsworth girl at the front desk... I liked the location, and the hotel was nice and clean with nice staff... But that girl ruined our stay... If you see any of my other reviews, you will find that we don't fuss or complain, and are easily pleased... I still gave this Hotel an average rating... But that girl is in the wrong job... She should work at the security checks in the airport... It would suit her down to the ground... Pathetic excuse. MAKE SURE to take a bus tour around the city... very nice... china town, little itally, the golden gate bridge, the iconic streets etc... Also... BOOK Alcatraz well in advance... It was brilliant.. The self guided tour was the highlight of my visit... Just do it. There seemed to be a lot of homeless people in the area, and in fact all over the city... That was unfortunate too. Enjoy San Fran...

Our room faced the street and there was average city noise but having stayed in NYC and DC it really didn't bother us at all. We had a nice view of Coit Tower! TV was an older one but we never turned it on. Room has a safe, small closet and a mini bar. They also have food and water out in their honor bar so watch the kids or you'll end up paying $$for candy! Lots of guests come down for the free wine at the managers reception and it's nice to hang out in the beautiful lobby which has a big fireplace, comfy chairs and a few computers for use. Trader Joes and Safeway are right across the street for room snacks. Parking at the hotel is $45 so we chose to park on the street at night (free from 7pm-7am) since we were out and about most of the day anyway. Read the signs though as there is street cleaning on various days. Staff was very nice and attentive. We used Priceline to book our room and received a rate at was $80 lower than the lowest rate on any site included BW site.

Best Western reservations was good about trying to help me book a double room for an additional night but one wasn't available so we booked a suite for 1 night. When we arrived at the hotel, they did upgrade us to stay in the suite for the entire trip so we didn't have to change rooms. This was a really nice bonus. We were in a 2-room suite on the 3rd floor. The rooms weren't very big but it was nice having 2 separate rooms, 2 TVs, and a refrigerator. The pull-out couch was a very small double bed but my children are young so they were okay in that. Everything is fairly basic at this hotel. The bathroom itself is large but the shower & the sink area were quite small. My biggest problem here was that there are no curtains on the windows, at least in this suite with 2 windows. Only white plantation-type shutters that will not shut out the morning light. A nice bonus is the appetizers & wine offered in the lounge area around 5pm daily. We tried the attached restaurant for dinner one night & it was a decent Italian restaurant.

We had my 94 year old mother in the room next door and she was also very pleased, except with her stringent breakfast requirements. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The bed was exceptional. The staff were very friendly and attentive. As far as we were concerned there were only 2 negatives. Each room has a coffee maker, which is not good for making tea. They took about 50 minutes to get the water hot enough to make coffee or tea, and did not get it hot enough to add milk. I enquired about a kettle or jug, but they did not have one, so it meant making the tea, adding milk, and putting it back into the pot and wait another 15 minutes, so having a cup of anything took at least an hour. At least they did have refrigerators in the room. The second was the onsite Restaurant. We travel a lot, and this was our 20th World trip, each over a month, so are well used to hotels. It is an Italian Restaurant , and the food seemed fine, but not everyone wants to eat Italian all the time, and there was nothing else on the menu. The breakfast was served there, and it was a la cart, with a fairly limited range, but the pricing was good for what they had. This made getting breakfast a slow process, not getting what you actually wanted. On the last day, we found the Restaurant at the Marriot, about 150m down the road, this was a full buffet and was excellent, but a bit more expensive, so we were annoyed that we only noticed in time to have one dinner and the breakfast there the next morning. Both were excellent, the breakfast was a bit more expensive, but a lot more varied. As far as the hotel went, we were very pleased, except the minor problem of making tea. They were happy to bring a jug of hot water on request, but that was out of their coffee maker, so not exceptionally hot, and the San Francisco water is very chlorinated, where pure water was $3/gallon at the nearby 7-11.

Both times we booked a 2 x Queen bed room for 4 people - 2 adults and 2 children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first time our room was as expected, very comfortable, very clean and nicely decorated (just like the photo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on their web site) but a little small once we had 4 large suitcases in the room. Our flight arrived in the morning but as they had a room available we were able to check in early. The second visit at the hotel on arrival we were told there were no 2 x Queen rooms left on the non smoking floor, so they put us in a one bed king room with a sofa bed. I was rather disappointed in this, we had booked the room some 5 months prior to our trip, if there was not going to be 2 x Queen beds available, why did they accept our booking? I wish they had been honest at the time of booking because if they did not have a room as we required available then we could have made alternative arrangements. Once we set up the sofa bed in our room we hardly had any room to move and very little room for our suitcases, so it was rather cramped. The sofa bed was VERY uncomfortable so I did not get a very good nights sleep for 2 days. As a result we were a little disappointed in this part of our stay the second time. Besides this, I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were nicely decorated and very clean. Both times we had a view of the street, a little bit noisy but quieter when we had the window closed. We had dinner one night in Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Pescatore which is located in the hotel, the food and service was excellent. We also had breakfast there each morning which was also enjoyable. For the first visit we were given breakfast vouchers for a continental breakfast but not for the second visit which was a bit strange as our booking was exactly the same for both visits. There is a shopping centre across the road from which you could buy food and supplies. Our rooms had free Wifi and an in room safe. The lobby area is very inviting and there was also a computer available for use but it was out of order most of the time we were there. We used the Valet parking for one night for our hire car as it was convenient for us to do so but be aware of the cost if you do decide to park your car there (approx $40 per night). It was a short walk to Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz wharf and other attractions in the area and we felt it was a good safe area for us to stay with our two children. They also stored our luggage as we had a late flight on the day of our departure. All staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.

It can be noisy in rooms facing the courtyard because air conditioning/heating/fan units all back onto it and the noise carries. But they offered to move us, and anyway earplugs were good enough for a restful night. The main gripe is because this time I had a hire car. Headline price $44 for 24 hours. Ouch. Still, the website said \"For just an additional $10.00 more on top of your rate, you are receiving parking. What could be more perfect than that?\" Except that it wasn't $10 on top of my rate, it was $10 on top of the headline rack rate, which was already $50 more than the discounted one, even for last minute bookings. So it works out as $60 for parking, not $10. A bit sneaky? I phoned them to see if they could do anything. No good. Eventually I booked, and decided to suffer the charge at the hotel. When I arrived, they aggressively pushed the parking. They offered to discount it to $40. As I unloaded our luggage we must have been asked three or four times if we wanted them to park the car. When I asked about alternatives, they said there was another car park over the road, but they told me only the hotel allowed me to come and go. But they failed to tell me that 100 yards from the hotel there was FREE STREET PARKING (turn right, and it's opposite the large bus park). Albeit that I needed to check what days there would be street cleaning. But from Saturday evening to Monday afternoon I was able to leave the car without charge. Luckily, I stumbled across this because I went straight out on a drive after arriving at the hotel. But if I'd paid $80-$120 dollars for hotel parking and found the street parking was free, I'd be furious. The way the hotel pushed their parking rather than telling me all my options was disappointing at best. And less likely to trust them, which was a shame.

We told the Front Desk Agent checking us in that we were celebrating our 6 month wedding Anniversary and that was why we were visiting. I asked for an interior view room based on what was said about the exterior rooms being noisy and I was happy with the quietness of the interior room. When getting to the room we were very pleased, the room had a lovely mirrored backdrop, California shutters, a view of the tiny courtyard, a nice TV and was very well decorated and had character and was charming! The room looked clean and well maintained. There was some issues with cleanliness after more review but when mentioned to upper Management, it was taken care of after the fact.. There was a concierge in the lobby and they were helpfull with booking us a dinner show. We were only informed after the fact, not at check-in that there was a meet every evening in the lobby with complimentary champagne/beer, which would've been nice to know. The fallowing evening we joined this and met some great people and had some great conversations with other travellers. Also, we had breakfast coupons placed in our key packet but not explained to us and had I not read them we would've missed out on the complimentary breakfast, which saved us money towards other activities. It was down pouring one night and my husband and I were looking for a taxi and got rather poor service but again when mentined to upper Management was rectified after the fact. This put a damper on the beginning of our night but after walking in the rain and getting to where we needed to go, I got over it. The morning of our departure we were awoken at 8am with a housekeeper screaming and slaming doors in a language I don't understand and by her tone perhaps, it's best I didn't. She slammed the door beside our room a multitude of times so, we couldn't fall back asleep. When mentioning this to upper Management this was rectified also.

The concierge service was especially helpful. The restaurant in the building serves a very nice breakfast and has a simple bar if you're after a late night drink, although prices are a tad on the expensive side. There is a supermarket and drug store over the road and can be reached in three or four minutes from the hotel's front door. McDonalds, Subway and Burger King are all nearby. During my stay, there was only one elevator operating. It was very frustrating! I would imagine when they have them both working again it wouldn't be so bad. My experience was that it was quite an ordeal just to get upstairs! By biggest tip for anyone staying in Fishermans Wharf is to get away and see more of the city beyond Fishermans Wharf! Take a cable car and see the city on the move. Go and explore Union Square or Haight-Ashbury.

Overall, thought this was a good place to stay, our 2nd trip to San Fran. Pros: Convenient location near Fisherman's Wharf, easy walk to everything. I think the reason for most of the glowing reviews is the extremely reasonable rate for a San Fran hotel. This is not the Ritz Charles, but it is a very nicely updated, clean, and comfortable hotel. Rooms were small but modern with a Tuscan theme, well-maintained. Two of our family had interior rooms including myself, and I personally slept like a rock. We stayed at Union Square last time and I liked this location better, easy walk to restaurants and shops. Wine reception was a bonus (though about what you'd expect for free wine) and lobby was not extremely large and became very crowded during that time, nowhere to sit. Ate at the restaurant a couple times for lunch and dinner and it too was good. Female concierge was very helpful and all employees were pleasant. Cons: Small rooms, wierd setup with the sink outside the bathroom a few feet from the bed. No way to turn the bathroom light on without turning the light over the sink too, which illuminated the room in the middle of the night, waking the other person up in the case of couples. My brother had an exterior room and said that there was a lot of noise both from the street and the maid service starting in early am. My mom was not happy that she caught the maids throwing the decorative bed pillows on the floor while cleaning the room, though I'd imagine that a lot of hotel employees probably do all kinds of things while cleaning that no one really wants to know about.

As soon as I walked in the lady at the front desk dropped what she was doing to check in me in. Impressive. While checking in I was told that I was getting a complimentary upgrade to a King size room. \"Fabulous\" I thought to myself. I had a lot of bags as I was staying for 3 days while on a road trip. The bellboy ran, got a cart and took everything up instantly, while the attendant parked my car. So far so good\" I'm thinking. Then I got into my \"kingsize\" room. I own a king size bed and this was not one. This was quirk one. But the bellboy had already offloaded my luggage, I was beat, and it was late in the evening so I did not call to make an issue of it. But the room I did get was cute, clean, quiet and comfortable. It even came with a lighted, magnifying makeup mirror. The hotel does have wireless internet that works like a charm and they have the ability to print things for you if needed. I was there on a package deal so my room included complimentary Continental Breakfast in the attached Pescatore (?) Cafe, a nice touch. In the mornings they have the local newspaper there and a coffee/tea station set up until 10 I think they said. The brochure said hot chocolate too but I didn't find that. The restaurant was charming and I got just as excellent service there as I did in the hotel. Nick greeted us for a couple of mornings and made us feel right at home. They have an \"upgrade\" menu for the continental ticket holders and for $5 you can choose something off this menu instead of the standard bread and fruit. The Apetito (a ham and cheese omelet) was wonderful served with homestyle potatoes, juice and coffee. In the evenings from 5 to 6 they have a complimentary wine reception that was a welcomed treat after a long day of walking. Nice to sit by the fireplace sipping wine while unwinding and a great way to \"meet your neighbors\" a darling couple from Cincinnati joined my husband and I for a nice fireside chat. The brochure said there were to be tidbits to go along with the wine but all I found was a crumbly tray and I got there at 5:10 and stayed until after 6 and nothing was refilled, so that was a bit disappointing, but the wine was fabulous. I had booked the tour to Alcatraz and took off walking in the morning to get to the dock for boarding, what a nice walk. Out the front door two blocks and turn right easy directions and I was there within 10 minutes. The parking at the hotel is valet only but I never used my car once. I walked every where around the area and the two times I needed to go any distance the attendant out front hailed a cab for me and i was whisked away within seconds. No waiting around. So my only other quirk was the parking rate. It was $25 a night with my package, higher if you didn't have the discount. So even at $25 I thought that was a bit pricey, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. Every so often I would have a question about the area (directions/where to go) and no matter who I asked up front I got a courteous and immediate answer. Even when checking out I must have been asked by 5 different employees if I needed directions or a map. It was a wonderful knowing that even after checking out I was still being taken care of. They currently are working on one of the two elevators but even that didn't slow down getting around. I saw doggie treats by the front door and I can only speculate that they allow pets. I didn't see any while I was there and I definitely didn't smell any which was a plus. Overall, this hotel was great! Excellent location for the Fisherman's Wharf area. Excellent staff. Nice amenities. It would be absolutely perfect if the parking was included or reduced even more, but I digress. I'd stay here again and in fact will be staying here again on my return visit in a couple of months. Maybe then I'll see what the King size room is like.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful accommodations and staff is very friendly and helpful!\u201d", "Author": "EnjoyTraveling_10", "ReviewID": "UR86657923", "Content": "We had a fabulous time while in San Francisco!

It is the perfect location - very close to the bustling main street of Fisherman's Wharf, but just far enough away to be quiet and comfortable. The pick-up location for the double decker sightseeing bus is within sight of the front door of the hotel and the cable car turn-around is just a short walk away. (Be sure to pick up a MUNI Visitor Passport for 1, 3 or 7 days to save yourself some money!) The rooms are clean and fresh and a decent size. Our room had a king size bed (with a full wall of mirrors which made the room appear larger), along with a desk and comfy chair. The only downside to the room was that the sink / mirror was outside the door to the room with the toilet / shower. At first glance, it looked like a great way for one person to be in the bathroom while the other gets ready at the sink, until the first (second, tenth, etc.) time that you exit the bathroom and whack your spouse with the bathroom door! But don't be discouraged because this is truly the only downside that we found with the entire hotel. The wine reception from 5 to 6 in the lobby was a welcomed event to wrap up your day of sightseeing and get a chance to mingle with other travelers. And the restaurant attached to the hotel (Cafe Pescatore) provided us with one of the best meals of our visit. If you require a hotel with all the extras, like a pool, hot tub, spa and in-house fitness room, then you may need to look elsewhere.

We were pleasantly surprised at how the lobby looked. It basically looked exactly as the picture on the Tuscan Inn webpage. Our room was small, but good enough for 2 people who travel light and don't spend lots of time in the room. It was nicely decorated and very clean. The bathroom was roomy compared to a lot of hotel rooms I've been in. The location could not be better. There are lots of attractions in walking distances of the hotel. There is a Safeway grocery store across the street, and a Trader Joe's behind the hotel. There is free wi-fi access, as well as a computer in the lobby for customer use. In the morning, there is coffee and tea served in the lobby. In the evening, there is wine served in the lobby, limit 2 per guest. Information of note on this: I believe the website used to say there was biscotti served with the coffee, but no longer says that, and there isn't any served. It's possible I read this in some reviews. Also, it appeared something had been served on a large plate at the wine reception we attended, but we got there 10 minutes after the reception started and the plate was empty and not replenished. Not a problem however. More notes: At check-in we were asked if we needed the key to the wet bar, which we declined. However, this cut us off from the use of the refrigerator. I don't know if there was a fee for the key to the wet bar, but if you're interested in using the refrigerator, be sure to ask up front. Also, the wet bar/refrigerator is built into the dresser in the room, so drawer space is severely limited. Also, be warned that the street in front of the hotel is quite dark at night. There is a lack of lighting on this street. While we didn't feel unsafe, it is worth mentioning. Not that this is the hotel's fault. Now, the bad news: Some of the staff at this hotel is problematic. The night I was at the wine reception, I overheard the guy serving the wine say something about one of the hotel guests that would probably have caused a fight if the guest had heard him say it, and deservedly so. The housekeeping staff knocks lightly then lets themselves in without much wait. We were dressed, but it could have caused embarrassment... twice. But my biggest staff problem: We arrived at the hotel early, and our room wasn't ready, which was no big deal. The woman at the desk went ahead and checked us in, and told us if we gave her our cell phone number she would call when the room was ready. Then she took our luggage to the side of the counter and told us they would store it until we returned. Four hours later, and no phone call, we returned to the hotel. A different woman was at the desk (the first woman was still around), and checked in all over again, and our room was ready. Lo and behold our luggage was where we left it, available to anyone who reached for it. I realize they were busy, but this did not leave me with a good feeling for the front desk. All complaints and comments aside, this was a good choice in hotel. In the event I return to San Francisco, I will check at the Tuscan Inn for availability first.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAffordable \"boutique\" hotel in SF\u201d", "Author": "tunagary", "ReviewID": "UR82103686", "Content": "Third stay @ the Tuscan.

We chose the hotel because we loved the location, and we enjoy earning our Best Western points when traveling. We chose a non-smoking, king bed room. As stated in other reviews, the room was small, but it was also well appointed. It had everything we needed. The bathroom had a small tub, but this was not a luxury hotel, so that was to be expected. The bed was comfortable, the tv worked, and the room was quiet. That was all we really needed. Usually Best Western hotels include breakfast with the room rate, but this one does not. Instead, the hotel offered a hosted wine tasting each afternoon from 5pm to 6pm. This was nice, as each person was allowed two full glasses of wine, but we only made it back to the hotel in time one afternoon. We were too busy exploring the city to get back in time for the wine tasting on our other two nights at the hotel. We would have preferred the free breakfast each morning instead. There were several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, including one attatched to the hotel, but a free breakfast is always nice to have. We were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf from our hotel. It was very convenient for that purpose, which is why we chose it. Other than the hotel not including breakfast, the only other issue is that Best Western would not give us points for this stay. When I questioned the Best Western customer service about this, I was told that I received a special AAA rate for the hotel, and as such, my stay did not qualify for the rewards points. This was not mentioned on the Best Western website where I booked my stay, by the hotel when I presented my rewards card for check-in, or on the reservation paperwork emailed to me by Best Western. I am disappointed by this bait and switch by Best Western. I might have chosen a more upscale hotel if I had known I would not receive points for this stay. I do not hold the hotel responsible for this, but I would have liked to have known ahead of time by either Best Western or at least by the hotel itself upon check in that I would not be receiving points for the stay. Five years ago we stayed at the Marriott nearby, and we might have chosen that hotel again for this stay had we known about the points.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Carmenzoe", "ReviewID": "UR73520348", "Content": "This is a great hotel - fantastic location, nice rooms and comfortable beds.

We got a San Francisco city pass, which included 7 days on the muni, streetcar, trolley or the F-line. the pass also included a few siteseeing attractions...this pass cost around $60.00 a person...very well worth it. I think the concierge has a small map with all the bus routes shown on it, take this map with you, so you can figure out what bus takes you where....once you get tired of walking...just find a bus. Another tip.... across the street from the Tuscan Inn there is a safeway store, etc. We picked up pop, junk food, water, muffins, fruit etc,...this is cheaper then using the items in the mini bar in the room. they also have small safes in the room, but it costs $1.70 a day to use.

Also, if you're travelling with family or as a group, note that the 2 bedded rooms are only doubles; queens are MUCH more comfortable for 2 people (including kids!) to share. Also consider the location. Most tourists will find Fisherman's Wharf pretty enjoyable, but you are a bit removed from the \"real\" San Francisco.

I had asked for a room facing the garden as suggested by other posters here due to the street noise, but in return we were awaken unpleasantly by loud work noise internally by workers who are doing the window work talking and singing early in the morning! I called the front desk who promised to ask the workers to lower their noise as it was still early but that didn't help. We asked for a room change and was told that our bags will be moved to the new room, but when we're back later in the afternoon, our new room wasn't ready, neither are our bags moved. after another 1-2hours of delay, our bags are finally moved to our new room after I had to personally speak to their supervisor Gregory twice! Gregory wasn't friendly and definitely did not seem happy to help me at all. Fortunately I didn't have to deal with him anymore and had a better second night. Besides my terrible experience, here are my impressions of the property - Pros 1. Great location (proximity to the wharf, pier 39, cable car station etc) 2. Free wireless Internet Cons 1. Absurd valet parking costs (There are cheaper alternatives nearby) 2. Extremely small rooms (They are REALLY small) 3. Bad customer service (Front desk supervisor not friendly and doesn't appear to be willing to help) 4.

The first night we had a room on the outside perimeter of the building, facing Mason St., and the street noise was absolutely unbearable. It was not just cars and traffic (which I would understand) but screaming, yelling, honking, and all kinds of commotion -- especially at about 2am, which is when I'm assuming the local bars let out. The noise from inside the hotel was not much better. The walls were paper thin, and my son woke up in a panic at one point because he thought the voices he was hearing were INSIDE our room. We asked to be moved to a quieter room the next day, and the front desk was very accommodating (I got the feeling this happens all the time). The second room was smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep. We never tried the coffee/tea in the morning or the manager's reception in the afternoon (we were out sightseeing most of the time), though they are a nice touch.

I am proud of myself for picking this hotel, and I assure you that I would stay nowhere else in San Francisco, other than the Best Western Tuscan Inn.

I guess some people go for image. I was looking forward to a nice stay based on what I had seen on BW website and the reviews here. I was disappointed. This is the type of hotel that has a fancy lobby and nice pictures and decorations throughout the building, but as for substance--lacking. My room was supposedly upgraded to a larger room, but if this was the case I'd hate to see the smaller rooms. The room had fancy colorful furniture, but was small and lacked certain things a higher-priced place like this ($170) should have. There was no hair dryer, no microwave, and I am still not sure if I was using shampoo or some type of lotion (the tube didn't really say clearly). Their windows were stylish, but who cares when the view is lousy and they are small and only open slightly? They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park (it costs extra to park) and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it. I did this and it took them a long time to get my car. There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space. If there were others wanting in at the same time, someone would have had to park on the street or drive around the block. Also, the location is dull; nothing of real interest withing a couple of blocks all around. There is a restaurant adjoining the hotel, but not owned by the hotel, where I ate dinner. The food was okay but not great. The only really good thing about the hotel was I didn't have to pay for it since it was a business trip.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value For Money\u201d", "Author": "ForbesAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR43218778", "Content": "Best location in Fisherman's Wharf.

The Tuscan staff moved our packed luggage into the new room, and my husband and I discovered that both of our phone chargers were missing.

Nothing has been done to correct our issues while staying at the Tuscan. This experience has left a very poor taste in our mouths, and we will definitely never stay there again.

We ate in the hotel restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an Italian theme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was very good. Good food and service. The concierge was very helpful and extremely friendly. We did find the concierge was very busy in the mornings, trying to arrange tours for people. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the workout facility. The hotel has one computer (with printer) available with free internet. And free wi-fi throughout the hotel which worked flawlessly. This is a Best Western, but it is operated by Kimpton - so it is pet friendly. They advertised that with a picture of the manager's dog on the check in desk. All in all it was a wonderful stay and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d highly recommend it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we did get an amazing rate, so that made it seem even better. The location is excellent if you want to be near the wharf. It was a two block walk to Pier 39. And the street it was on (North Point), was busy enough to always feel safe walking, but not so busy that you felt crowded. The only downside, is not a fault of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather, my personal preference. We usually stay in the Marina District, but we wanted a hotel near the wharf so we could walk to the Bay to Breakers (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay near Union Square, even though it would have been more convenient). I like visiting the Wharf, but personally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather stay in the Marina District, and visit the wharf. To be honest, I was pretty sick and tired of the wharf after four days. But again, that was my choice, not a hotel problem. All in all, if you want to stay near the wharf, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d highly recommend the Tuscan Inn. Though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d try to get a discounted rate.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDid we all stay in the same hotel??\u201d", "Author": "DEPCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR30557770", "Content": "They are getting three stars because the room was very clean and the hotel is close to the wharf.

We decided on the Best Western after we figured we'd save more and still be as close to Fisherman's wharf.

Although our weekend was during a storm, the close proximity to the piers and public transportation still made our location idea. The staff was very helpful in giving us suggestions and directions when we asked. They also scheduled our shuttle back to the SFO airport.

We chose the Best Western Tuscan Inn as our base whilst in San Francisco on the first three nights of our tour. We arrived at SFR approximately 1 hour late due to flight delays at London Heathrow and in the pouring rain and, of course, suffering from jet lag. Despite all this, we found the Tuscan Inn easily in a city strange to us. After reading other reviews on Trip Advisor we made sure that we had a \"Garden View\" room as we knew that the jet lag would see us awake at about 2:00am! I don't know about the street view rooms but we had no problems with noise whatsoever. The rooms were pleasant, clean and did not disappoint. The hotel is certainly well placed for access to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 etc. My wife suffers from arthritis and cannot walk far but we had no problems in walking to the departure point for Alcatraz tours, Mr. Toad's city tour, Cable Cars, etc. Staff were helpful and generally friendly. The daily wine reception was a great idea as it got guests together and talking about their experiences of the day. Was a little upset by waiter serving wine at the second of these we went to. On arriving we initially spoke to some other guests and I then went to request two glasses of wine on behalf of myself and my wife - reaction was, in broken English, - \"Only two glasses each!\" I explained we had just arrived and this was our first drink. \"NO, only two glasses\" \"We haven't had one yet!\" \"I must see your room key\" With annoyance I retrieved and displayed the key and finally got a glass of wine. I know they don't want clients getting drunk at their expense but at the end of the day it wasn't even quality wine just a very cheap plonk. Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking.

So, make sure that you request one of the larger suites, they are all priced the same. If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise.

Unfortunately, I had come down with a rather nasty throat infection on this, the 2nd leg of our extensive trip, coming from 5 nights in Santa Monica, LA. Anyway, the next morning I requested another room with either a street or garden courtyard view. Big difference! The room we got was bigger, toward the rear of the building, so a long walk from lift, but well worth it. It also had a pleasant courtyard view. This room also felt as if it had been used maybe a third as much as the other one!! Perhaps they like to let out all the 'close to lift ' rooms to be kind to housekeeping?!? Biggest difference though - the beds - no uncomfortable springs!! Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet/shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin. Decor etc. was quite nice and fresh looking, and it is because of this that I would not hesitate to come back - provided I got a similar room! Internet provided via a pc in foyer was very handy!! Only thing I missed was a gym, for some reason I had an inclination to use the gyms while we were O/S!? Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic. I was dutifully helped at 130am when I wanted a hospital to nip my sickness in the bud, which was much appreciated. However, I felt a little weird, almost uncomfortable when on a couple of nights, whilst suffering coughing fits, I decided to go downstairs and use the internet, so as to not keep my fellow guests awake.

Ate at Caesars old style Italian - fantastic for price, and also Mona Lisa on Columbus in awesome Little Italy.

With the exception of this one bad egg, everyone was very nice. The free wine/beer and coffee/hot chocolate/biscotti is a wonderful touch and we took full advantage of it. I would recommend making reservations at the restaurant as it quickly filled up every night and we were turned away frequently - I heard one traveller get into a heated discussion about never being able to get in for dinner. My only recommendation would be to ask for a room that's not on the first floor, or a room with a view of the garden. The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night. Also, the restaurant drags their tables and chairs inside at midnight or later and then outside at 7:00am. It makes a lot of noise too - just a tip. Anyway, we loved it at this hotel and were very happy. Last word of caution - if you're going to San Francisco, don't rent a car. Parking is expensive ($40 per night) and everything is very much within walking distance. We took a cab across town and it was $10...

We have stayed at this hotel once before, a few years ago, so knew that the rooms were not particularly large. On this occasion our room was quite small, but extremely nice, although it did contain the smallest wardrobe I had ever seen! The hotel is very well situated, 5 minutes walk from Fishermans Wharf, shops, restaurants and cable cars etc. We were fortunate to get an inside (or courtyard) room, so were not disturbed by noise at all (except for 1 night when the fridge went mad!) We had a problem with the AC whilst we were there, but a very friendly and helpful maintenance man came within minutes of reporting it, and had it fixed at the touch of a button. Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain. The best point about this hotel is the wonderful restaurant attached to it - Cafe Pescatore. Both breakfast and evening meal were excellent - it is very well used, so bookings are advised for the evening.

Our concerns were unfounded as we did not hear a sound. The room was a nice size and beautifully furnished. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries.

We did however make use of the PC/Internet access available in the lobby without cost.

The wine reception is a good way to wind down at the end of a busy day sightseeing and also to meet and share experiences with other guests. There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services. Upon checking-in, we were told that we would receive complementary continental breakfast for each morning of our stay. We do not usually rate these well but this was really nice - a large dish of fresh fruit, croissant or a muffin, juice and coffee. We also ate dinner at the hotel restaurant (Cafe Pescatore) one night. The food and service were both excellent.

There were three of us and I had booked a two double bed room and had a confirmation to prove it. I had chosen this hotel for that particular reason as I was having difficulty getting a two bed room at nearby wharf hotels. I was given a king room with a cot on check-in. After a few trips by the clerk back to the manager who remained out of site I was told I had not booked a double bed room but a double occupancy room which wasn't true. They said they noticed we had three people so had automatically provided a cot to our room, I was told they were full and there were no other rooms available. When we got to our room the cot was already there but due to the small room I had to re-arrange furniture to get it to fit, in doing so having to re-assemble their cheap particle board table. The room faced a side street, the street directly below became very active at 5 am with motorcycles in particular in addition to trucks noisily heading up the street. I'm a sound sleeper normally and nothing wakes me so this was just a sign of how noisy it was. I managed to get switched to a two double bed room for our next couple of nights and experienced what all the good reviewers must have. The room was significantly larger, still small but liveable, and although still on the 3rd floor it faced the wharf and what I would have thought was the busier street but the traffic was much quieter and I didn't hear much at all the next two mornings. The valet's were a little slow and I hated the vulture baggage guy. I don't have a problem being helped up to the room although I;m fine doing it myself. This guy immediately put all my bags on the cart while I was pre-occupied with the valet but then while I was trying to correct the problems with the room at check-in he was impatiently trying to get us to hurry up in spite of me telling him just to leave the bags. The location is great, I opted for a Fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near Union square on business in the past and I'm glad I did as it was easy walking distance to Chinatown and the touristy area of the wharf.

She then said that there were no king bed suites at the hotel at all and that all suites had two beds. I asked her why their website stated that this type of room was available if they did not exist as she had just stated. She said the website must be incorrect. Next we were offered a standard king bedroom, and I pointed out that this was a cheaper room than the suite we had booked. She said 'well you got a good rate by booking on line'. Like that matters. I had paid $1900 up front for the suites 2 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prior when making the booking. I then asked if the next suite would also be two beds instead of the king bed as she had just stated that this type of suite did not exist. Unbelievably she said that this next suite would have a King bed contradicting the lie she had just told us. At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour. The funny thing was that when we got to the room, there were welcome cookies and a welcome note for a Mr and Mrs Bonfiglio. So, sorry to this couple as they probably got a load of lies and bull when they arrived to find that they did not get the room they had booked. The hotel is also very noisy but I guess this is inevitable considering the location. The free drinks are great if you and like the feeling of getting something for nothing. Please also beware of the restaurant at the hotel. They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6. We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge. On the plus side some of the staff were nice and helpful especially the concierge who was most gracious. The suites are a decent size, clean and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is not of a bad standard. If you want to be near Fishermans Wharf the location is great. I did contact Best Western on returning home to see what response I would get after the investigation. Apparently the hotel had told Best Western that we were contacted directly by the management during our stay and that the matter was resolved (we were not contacted). While they apologised for the inconvenience they said that there was nothing more to do as we were eventually given the room we had booked. No mention of the lies, arrogance and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup you attitude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of some of the staff then??", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis Mo", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "pjsltk", "ReviewID": "UR17193674", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights for $125 from Hotwire.

In the same area as the Radisson and the Sheraton. When I walked in I immediately thought \"boutique hotel\" not \"Best Western\". It reminded me of the Napa River Inn in Napa, CA. They take the \"Tuscan\" theme all the way. When you call the hotel they say \"Buon Giorno\" and play Italian music while you are on hold. The valets are dressed like Venetian gondoliers. The lobby is reminiscent of Italy. Lovely potted flowering plants and trees fill the view from the picture window in the lobby, while a welcoming fire is lit in the lobby fireplace.... even though the day we were there, it was sunny and a pleasant 78. The next day was windy and the fog was blowing in, so the fire was quite apropos. We arrived early - noonish, and check-in is not til 3 p.m. They were very accomodating and allowed us to park the car in their garage (added charge at all hotels in SFO) and leave our bags in a secure room until check-in, so we could go out and start our day in SFO. They upgraded us to a suite and told us they would call on our cell phone when the room was ready. They called within an hour! The room was spacious, very clean and tastefully decorated. They could have made the LR area smaller to accomodate the King size bed in the BR better - not much room between the bed and the TV stand to squeeze by. Be sure to ask not to be put in the rooms right above the driveway/entry. At 6 a.m. they roll out the dumpster and the garbage truck comes roaring up to empty it (clang, bang) and then backs up to leave (beep, beep, beep). A half hour later the neighboring business hauls their dumpster out for pick-up and another garbage truck comes along.... A minor disturbance in an otherwise great hotel.

Room 402 did have a view, they were willing to change room but we had already uppacked and did not realize the heater was not working until our 2nd night. Did not asked for a discount; they told me to contact Manager who was unable at the time each time I inquired. The Corceige was excellent and some of the hotel staff did care and others did not (may be the government rate). The coffee in the morning was great; did not attend the wine party. Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great. If you book a room, asked for the courtyard view if possibe. Location is everything at this site; everything you need is right in the area. Pier 39 and other activities are in walking distance. Do you go the aquarium; not worth the price. Grayline tours were great. Took the $10 per person on the ride around the bay (best price). The battleship was a great tour also. Did not do Alcaraz tour due to the kids. Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service. There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service.

Location was also near Pier 39 (shopping, sea lions, and marina), Ghiradelli's chocolate factory, and Alcatraz. Lots of little shops nearby- very touristy. At Pier 39 the shops were nicer with a great outdoor atmosphere. Loved eating at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.- as in Forest Gump. Great shrimp, fish, chicken fingers, hushpuppies, etc with lots of windows to enjoy the ocean and marina. The gift shop is great, too, if Forest Gump is one of your favorite movies like mine. My husband and I went for our anniversary and it was perfect. The Golden Gate Bridge is unbelievable! It just makes you happy inside seeing it. We walked across and back which was so nice to enjoy each other's company without toddlers wrapped around our legs. With this hotel we received a free 1 hour tour/cruise around Alcatraz and down to the Golden Gate Bridge. You also get 2 free transportation passes each day of your stay that we used for the trolley systems. Their travel system is called the MUNI and includes the trolleys or the city buses. The drivers are a great help for any questions you have. We used the trolley and buses for the Golden Gate Bridge. WE Loved the Trolleys! You can just ride with no particular destination in mind to get a feel for the city. Also great for going to the section of the city for the major shopping area (I can't remember what it's called but the area feels like New York City- very busy, hustle and bustle.) And remember the MUNI passes were free! We rented a car to go to Napa Valley to see the vineyards and Muir Woods to see the giant redwood trees. This was a nice little morning hike that my husband really enjoyed. Whatever the weather says for your trip to San Fran, take a heavy jacket/ coat. Everybody that doesn't do this buys one at the little tourist shops. (smile) Hotel was clean and a great price. However, don't count on the concierge for help.

The Tuscan theme, although not entirely successful in making you forget what continent you're on, made for a very pleasant and comfortable decor nonetheless. We had a standard king room (ask for courtyard view to avoid street noise) -- the room was small but it worked fine for a short stay. The room has a mini-fridge/bar. No breakfast provided other than coffee/tea and small biscotti pieces. They do host a wine/beer reception from 5-6pm every evening. The location is fabulous.

But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king. -Showed up for breakfast in their restaurant at 10:31am--I'm not exaggerating--would not serve us, since they said they stop taking orders at 10:30am--the place had one other couple in it--could they afford to lose business over one minute? I guess so. Perhaps I had higher expectations, or perhaps not...Staff at front desk was fine, obviously the restaurant could use some work...Rooms were clean, always done promptly. Location was nice for getting all around the city; we mostly walked from place to place, even to and from downtown along the Embarcadero.

We were very pleased with the hotel's location right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf/North Beach...close to great restaurants (Pat's Cafe & The Buena Vista), transportation (buses, trolleys, & ferries), and the waterfront but what we weren't informed of was the on-going, messy & noisy renovations (Frommer's listed the property as having completed room renovations in 2005). There was no mention from hotel staff...all that was present was a dumpster out front and a small sign on our floor (2nd) saying sorry for any inconvenience. Thankfully we took off early every morning so we really didn't hear the workers until our last day.

After reading countless reviews of this property, I was confident we could have an enjoyable stay here and avoid any potential pitfalls - and we were not disappointed. I discovered a special rate at Travelzoo, which probably swayed me to try this hotel, and made my own reservation with Best Western. There was no problem in them honoring the special rate. If you are bothered by street noise then be sure to ask for a room with a courtyard view. The courtyard is tiny - but we could not detect any street noise in our room on the second floor looking over the courtyard. Currently (January 2008) they are remodeling some rooms on the upper floors, and there is considerable construction noise in some areas that started after 9:30 AM and stopped by 5:00 PM. It would be a good idea to ask for a room away from the construction for the least noise, if you are going to be in your room during the day or sleeping in late. Gregory, at check in, was quick and polite and helpful with our request for a courtyard room. The room is a bit on the small-side, but I think that is the standard in San Francisco with only a few exceptions. Our room was very clean and fresh-smelling. One window did open, which kept the room from getting stale. Drawer space was minimal, with only two small but deep drawers, and the closet was a little small. Clothes for two people for five days maxed out the tiny closet. There is a refrigerator in the room with is also the mini-bar, so there isn't a lot of room in there for take-out food, but is ample for medications, etc. If you plan to use the refrigerator, make sure to take a key to the mini bar, or it will be able to get into it. The room includes a ironing board and iron, although using it would make the room a bit cramped. There is a wall-mounted hair dryer in the bathroom. The restaurant in the hotel - Cafe Pescatore - does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced. Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course - pizza. However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1-4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service. We were very happy with the location of this hotel. Within two blocks (and not even uphill!) you could catch the Mason-Powell cable car, also many of the Muni Buses go by the hotel and the \"F Line\" historic streetcar is only one block away. Just a 3 block walk north and you are on the waterfront of Fisherman's Wharf. There are two grocery stores (Safeway and Trader Joe's) within 2 blocks of the hotel. One of the things we enjoyed most, was walking away from the touristy area of Fisherman's Wharf and onto the side streets to look for restaurants. There are many smaller places with very good food at very reasonable prices, all within walking distance. Each night when we returned to our room, it had been cleaned up very nicely and restocked. We made sure to tip the housekeeping staff each morning, perhaps that insured that they did an outstanding job every day.

Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about. Maid service was prompt and outstanding. But, it was close to the Wharf and soooo convenient. So, maybe the price was warranted. BEWARE though....parking is $45 + tax. I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all. Then the clerk told me the price. Woah!!! When we arrive at the valet stop, the valet told me that if we have AAA, the price would be $25. Cool. When we went to check out, the front desk clerk said that we could not have the discount because we did not make a reservation to park. WHAT??? I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also.

We found the tourist advice to be slightly biased towards a particular company, and knew little about the sevices of other tour companies, even though one is very well know and patronized.

(Twinkies!!) We were there for 10 nights, the staff were very friendly and pleased to help. we were always greated with a smile by the valet guys too. The only bad thing is that they didn't reply to my girlfriend regarding a suprise birthday cake for me until we were at the checkout desk...Together!!! Oh well it's the thought that counts We did have a snoop around some of the other hotels and went to a few for breakfast, some were grander but by no means over shadowing the Tuscan Inn. Our room was both spacious, airy and light whilst being quiet at night. the room was always perfectly cleaned each day. The italian restaurant linked to the hotel was great, both for food and just popping in for a quick beer by the bar, very friendly!!! The only dissapointing thing is that we were so busy we missed the wine tasting - from the looks of the people who took part though, it's designed for the older generation!!!

At check-in, they had our kids in a room at the end of the hallway, which we were not comfortable with. We took just one room for that night and they moved us to adjacent, though not connecting, rooms the next two nights. This was much better and gave us a lot more space. Beware, if you request adjoining rooms, they are not guaranteed and really not even planned. They told me they don't assign rooms until the day of check-in, and they were also overbooked.

The hotel was clean and decorated nicely. The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so. The linens and bed were comfortable. The shower head was stong and the water was nice and warm. On the first part of our stay, we were in a courtyard room. This made the room seem a bit larger by the way that it was set up. When we returned later in the week we were put in an outside room. It was noisier and even with the shutters closed the light from the Safeway sign kept the room pretty bright. I work night shift and am used to sleeping during the daylight, but for people who like it dark, that might be more difficult. The second room also smelled a bit musty (think mothballs) and we could never get it aired out. Only a mild inconvenience though. The am coffee/tea/biscotti is nice. It was a nice stop before heading out for a bigger breakfast. Only participated in the evening reception once. The wine was good, but the appetizers were gone. Lots of people take advantage of this time, it was always busy. We did eat at the hotel restaurant for one breakfast. The food was ok...and the service was just ok too. Nothing to write home about for the price. Next time I would probably go somewhere else. The front desk staff recommended \"Fior d'Italia\" for a dinner reservation.

That basically means it costs a lot more than a roadside/highway exit hotel but isn't quite as nice. We heard numerous things about the Fisherman's Wharf area, and many of them were true. There is plenty to do during the day because of the endless shops and restaurants, and transportation is available to take you to all places in the city as well as other destinations like Alcatraz. At night the area takes on a different persona with homeless people hanging around the darkness, but at no point did we ever feel unsafe walking the streets. The weirdest thing was how everything seemed to close between 9 and 10 at night when there seemed to be so many tourists lurking about. The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets. Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free/self park lots that are part of the hotel. Not only is it pricey at $36/day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you. Our hotel room was very small and felt absolutely cramped when we had our two suitcases opened on the floor. The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it. The overall look was fairly bland and a bit dated, but all of the furniture was in excellent shape and nothing appeared worn, dirty or neglected. Two negatives: Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle-of-the-night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated; and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up.

The noise was terrible and even when closed, the windows (old, thin and full of condensation) provided no insulation. There were no curtains (just sliding wooden shutters that we had to shove a chair against to make sure they were closed properly) which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. I asked the front desk whether we could move rooms. The woman was very helpful and said that as they had declared a number of rooms non-smoking she could offer me a room on the 2nd floor which would be much quieter as it faced a wall. Alarm bells rang in my head when she said they had made rooms non-smoking but I agreed to go and look. As soon as she opened the door the smell of stale smoke hit me and I said that if that was all they could offer then we would stay where we were. She told me that due to the high number of non-smoking rooms requested they had to make more rooms available. So be warned if you ask for a non-smoking room!! Also, avoid rooms on the ground floor facing Mason Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only will the street noise be terrible but there is a permanent smell of stale urine along that sidewalk. Our room was small by American standards although the mirrored wall (thankfully behind the bed!) made it look larger and bright furnishings helped. Our a/c unit worked although was noisy when put onto the cool setting. We kept it on the fan setting as it seemed to help to drown out the street noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c garbage collection at 6am was particularly nice! Room could have benefited from fresh paint and our carpet had a large iron burn and was damp under the a/c unit. Closet was small and would not hold our bags. Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer. In room safe would have been nice addition. Bed was comfortable & we were not bothered by noise from other bedrooms. Attached restaurant was overpriced and food looked average. We had breakfast there one day and it was nothing special. Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast/lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms. For much better Italian food head up to North Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 to 10 minute walk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where you will find a good choice of independent restaurants and cafes around the Colombus Ave/Washington Square area. You will be surrounded by locals (rather than tour groups) and will have a more realistic Italian experience. And if you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live without burgers, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the usual chains, make the 5 minute walk to Burgermeister at 759 Columbus.", "Date": "May 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "Leavita", "ReviewID": "UR7674185", "Content": "The Best Western Tuscan Inn is at the perfect location in San Francisco.

So it's good for Pier 39, the Bay trips, Ghirardelli Centre and the Cannery, but that is really all it has going for it. The room was small but it did have a desk, table & chairs and unit for fridge/TV stand. This meant it was all a little cramped. There was no wardrobe , just a curtained off rail. The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath/shower. There was an individual air-con unit in the window which was very noisy and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t generate much cold air. We found it much better to just open the window which obviously wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on hot days.

The maids woke us the first day by shouting to each other outside the room at 8am but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen after that. The room was cleaned, but not spotless, and the bed was made badly. This sloppy attitude was much the same at the front desk where they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really seem to know what was going on and there were usually queues as they were slow to deal with people. They were polite and did help eventually, but it was hard work. The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great breakfast is it? And there is a coffee machine in the room. I would rather save the money. It has an adjoining restaurant which we used for lunch one day.

The best part of the hotel was its location. It is perfectly situated just far enough off of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Fishermans Wharf but just a couple of blocks from everything. You are right near Pier 39, the cable car entrance, lots of great restaurants, stores, bookstore, trinket shops, you name it. It is actually quiet for having so much around it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to say that you can walk to any of the major attractions in under 15 minutes from the hotel. On a side note, I booked my reservation directly with the hotel about four months before we arrived. The reservation clerk said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You are lucky and got our Winter rate, here is your confirmation number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anything else about the reservation except I have a confirmation number and a great rate.

She said she would look into the problem and get right back to me. I was pretty steamed that they wanted to charge me full price and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to find the rates they quoted me. The manger found my original reservation and reduced my rates to almost match the quoted rates, not a perfect solution but much better than it could have been.

Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel. To park your car, the charge was $36 per night, pretty incredible but they know they have you by the throat. I will return to this hotel if we decide to visit San Francisco again. There is a Sheraton right across the street that was just as well located but looked newer, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check the rates there too.

This hotel is a weird hybrid.. calling itself Best Western, but being in partnership with Kimpton Hotels (which for those that don't know is a chain of more upscale boutique hotels). I have to think this is why the hotel looks and feels a lot better than other Wharf hotels I've stayed at previously. And frankly more upscale than other Best Westerns too. Staff were very pleasant, always asking if we needed directions or anything (we didn't, but it's nice to be asked) and smiling and opening doors etc. (including all the maids and bell boys we encountered) Small touches, but very pleasant. We didn't make it to the wine hour (having been drinking wine all day, it was not high on our agenda!) but have done that at other Kimpton hotels and it's a nice extra. Our room looked like a room in a Kimpton hotel, nice bed with decent white linens with burgundy and black throw pillows and accents. The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable. The great thing for us was the free parking. Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal. What I didn't realize at the time is that the park the car across the street in a public lot (I assumed it would be in covered hotel parking). Agree with other comments that breakfast at Cafe Pescatore is nothing to write home about, but again, my expectations were low, as it is just that kind of area.

Although I had frequented San Francisco on many occasions, I had never even noticed this property, and I wanted this weekend to be the most romantic ever. Prior to our arrival, I had contacted the concierge' desk and asked them to arrange for roses to be waiting in the room, and for a limousine for dinner on Saturday evening. They said they could accomodate me. Upon our arrival, we were directed to a \"mini-suite\" on the fourth (top) floor, southeastern corner of the hotel. Although it was not particular large, it had a quaint sitting room with a television, and coffee table, and the entire suite was very nicely decorated. This particular room had views of the Bay bridge, the Golden Gate bridge, and if we were sitting up in bed, we had a beautiful view of the bay and Fisherman's Wharf. There was a DVD copy of \"Under the Tuscan Sun\", which was a nice touch, although my girlfriend couldn't figure out why they left that particular movie. I explained to her that we were staying in the \"Tuscan Inn!!!\" We both had a good laugh, but never got to watch the movie. The roses in the room were the most beautiful my love had ever seen, and were in a beautiful vase with the stems hidden by a giant leaf wrappped inside the clear vase. Excellent choice of florist by the hotel. The evening Italian wine & beer reception was very nice, and complimentary for hotel guests. The limousine arrived on time, and the driver was very cordial and accomodating. Upon our checkout, I had the great pleasure of meeting \"Daniel\", the hotel concierge'. He is the BEST!!! I can not emphasize how much he adds to the overall hotel experience. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at this property.

We were in Calfornia for about 15 years in a row,for almost two weeks. We used to stay in downtown San Francisco , then found a nice small motel place near the wharf, but the mattresses became too lumpy for our backs. So, we were up in Calistoga(wine country) and needed a short two night stay before we headed home. I had read reviews of the Tuscan Inn in prior years and thought it would be a good choice. We were severely disappointed. The hotel manager did her best to help us, but certain problems with the hotel simply can not be corrected. The rooms that face the streets are very noisy due to tour buses, local buses and traffic. The courtyard room we were assigned was dark and dingy and since we are fresh air oriented, when we opened the windows we heard 30 +air conditioning units humming away. Couryard rooms are darker than street rooms. The interior of the room was sort of Rococo with a mishmash of colors. The room itself was small and crowded with old furniture and knick knacks. The bathroom had several problems. First ,it was tiny ,old and not at all modern. When I woke up early in the morning to use the facilities, a light outside on the vanity wakened my traveling companion. The inn advertises coffee and tea and biscotti in the morning. Regrettablyt, the biscotti were tiny pieces, quite inedible. The lobby is very busy, with lots of tourists rushing around, apparently quite a few on bus tours. We think the hotel needs a major redoing in almost every respect. Before we reserved, we asked the front desk about the mattresses and were told they were new. My side had that typical depression you find in a hotel bed where a person has been sleeping on the edge and the mattresses have not been turned or simply were not of good quaity to retain any support. We later in the day checked out several large chain hotels in the area, and found them not more expensive and just in more fantastic shape.

After reading other reviews about getting an inside room facing the courtyard I was ready to request that. Our flight was an early a.m. arrival and when we arrived the front desk let us know there was already a room available but it was an outside facing room. Since it was on the fourth floor we went ahead thinking it might be a little quieter since it wasn't on the street level. They let us know if we wanted to switch after the first night that wouldn't be a problem. We ended up staying in the room they gave us and it was just fine. In fact, I was thrilled to look out our window and actually see the towers of the golden gate bridge peeking over the other buildings between our hotel and the bay! We lucked out and were there when it was clear for a couple days. It was a bonus to be all checked in mid-morning and we were able to take off and enjoy the city right away. The location is great since it is only a couple blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, the ferry for Alcatraz, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, cable cars, bus stops, and there is a small shopping center across the street with grocery store, etc. to stock up on whatever you might want to keep in your room for snacks, drinks, etc. If you're traveling to SF for the first time and have kids with you I think this is a perfect location. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly, from the front desk, concierge, valet, and housekeeping. I would ignore the review or two that complain about this hotel. Some people aren't happy no matter what. The coffee and biscotti in the lobby in the morning was nice and all the guests that I talked to seemed very pleased to be there too. (coffee tasted extra good to me!) The lobby was decorated nicely. Too bad we weren't able to enjoy the fireplace because of the heatwave. Overall a nice atmosphere. The only slight downside (and it was slight) was the room size was a little small. I knew that going into it and was prepared so it wasn't a big surprise. We traveled with two teens and had a wheelchair to store in the room too but there was still enough room to put clothes, suitcases, etc. and still walk around the room. The beds were also very comfortable. It just might not be for someone who wants to hang out all day at the hotel in a roomy room.

The bed was comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was sufficient enough to rinse conditioner out of my long hair without use of the ice bucket. We stayed 2 nights July 11 and 12.

No kidding, less than 5 minutes walk and we were right at Fisherman's Wharf. The only slight complaint I had about the Tuscan Inn was when we checked in, we were given a key to the honor bar but when I opened the door to the bar, it was completely empty. No big deal for us as it's too expensive to eat out of it anyway. Was just curious to see what they would stock it with. I'm a travel agent so I'm pretty picky about my hotel rooms but I have to say I will be suggesting this hotel to my clients.

We should have come back here to begin with and spared ourselves the 4am room changing shenanigans over at the Sheraton. The Tuscan took us in at 10:00 am and let us check in immediately, gave us a courtyard view room (which is always quieter at the Wharf), and gave us a $149 rate (AAA) for a BEAUTIFUL room. We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom - it was room 459 - and the room had all the amenities we were looking for. Refrigerator, minibar, free wi-fi, iron & board, hairdryer, down comforters (they were HEAVEN) and pillow top beds. It was decorated beautifully in white, black, burgundy, and a touch of teal, with a mirrored wall to give it a more open feel, and wooden louvered shutters. Even the shower pressure was decent. The lobby (which has a fireplace and very comfy furniture) has a wine tasting for free between 5-6pm each night and you meet dozens of really nice people from all over the world. There is internet access near the fireplace area at a nominal charge if you don't have wi-fi. The restaurant, Pescatoro, is excellent. The rooms are spotless and the employees are as nice as you could ever want. Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides. Ours has two double beds. Some of the king beds had very comfortable sofa beds, which we had 2 years ago.

I read other reviews about noisy air-con and thought \"fool...switch it off\". Well, even in the \"off\" position, the air-con emits an sporadic, intermittent hum and vibration, which, combined with the fridge resetting itself during the night conspire to deprive you of sleep. Earplugs didn't work. I asked to be moved after the first night, thinking this was unique to the particular room we had been assigned on arrival (454 - which faced a wall, by the way.)

The location is terrific - two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms. Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking - we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys. We were told to take our luggage out and wait for the concierge, who never showed up. There were about five other cars in the area - we were told if we needed the car, the valet would get when we needed it. There was a fee of $29 per day for the parking. We parked the car and never needed to take it out until we left. We checked in during the daily \"wine tasting\" the hotel provided. That left the small lobby loaded with people blocking the desk and walkways. The wine tasting is a great idea but the lobby is so small that the crowds block access. I was totally amazed that the other guests didn't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms. Check in was quick. Our rooms were very small but beautifully decorated. We had no view - all we saw out the window was the back of another wing of the hotel. There was a mini-bar but it was locked and we did not have the key. There was a small refrigerator in the room. The furnishings were lovely. Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom. The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, creams) were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle. The beds were comfortable, the shower was hot, the towels luxurious. There was an ice machine on our floor but the soda machine was out of order. There was a 7-11 convenience type store down the street so we simply got soda there while we were out. Our air conditioner was terribly loud our first night there. The second day we stopped at the desk and spoke to the friendly clerk who had it fixed for us when we came back that night. There is a moderately priced Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had a deceont dinner at, but there are so many restaurants on the Wharf we preferred to eat there. We found an IHOP around the corner for breakfast. It is a 2 block walk to the wharf and the location is very convenient. We also were within walking distance of the cable cars and even walked up to Lombard Street. We paid $169 per night. While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small, but the location was just perfect.

Found the food there to be quite nice, and our service was always prompt and efficient. In fact, 2 of us have food allergies, and they bent over backwards to accomodate, changing recipes for us as needed. My only complaint for this hotel... sometimes the concierge is hard to find. The concierge goes off-duty at 4 or 5 p.m... too bad my meetings never end til after 5. HOWEVER, the front desk staff is always more than willing to jump in with helpful advice and recommendations. I've tried 4 or 5 of the local recommended restaurants, and the staff definitely knows what the area has to offer.

Their response was that there were no courtyard rooms available. Why they promise two rooms with a courtyard view, when they don't even have one to offer is beyond me. Our next disappointment was that we didn't even have towels. Again, I called housekeeping and their response was, yea we know! Their cavalier attitude gave one the impression that towels might not necessarily be one of the hotel's priorities. When the towels were finally delivered, I never got the correct number I requested.

I booked the room through Expedia, and because of this, the hotel wouldn't credit my Best Western Gold Card with either points or air miles. The price was great for a small but comfortable room. We did have a room on the 3rd floor over the sidewalk and street of North Point. The windows are crank operated, and thin, so there was some street noise from city buses from about 5:30 in the morning until about 10 at night. We are heavy sleepers and it didn't really bother us, as it seems to have bothered other reviewers. The hotel is an Italian mediterrean theme everywhere, entrance, lobby, garden courtyard, restaurant, and rooms. The staff are 100% present and attentive to your every need. Their friendliness reminded me very much of the Aloha spirit at Hawai`ian resorts and hotels. The lobby is small and cozy with a gas log fireplace, perfect for taking away the chill after those cool, foggy walks down to the waterfront. Guests actually talk to one another during morning coffee, and the free hour of wine at 5 pm. I highly recommend this hotel, for both quality and economy. We bought some of our food at one of the 3 grocery stores a block from the hotel. I'ts about 2 blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, 2 blocks to the cable car turn-around, 1 block to the F-Line trolley car, and 3 blocks to Pier 39. I liked to start and end my day walking out to the sea lions on the K pier at Pier 39. I also took the Blue and Gold ferry out to Alcatraz, and suggest everyone visiting S.F. see this sight for both the ferry boat ride, and for the rich history lesson.

The location is 1st class , a few minutes from the Wharf and all its attractions , and close to a Safeways Supermarket ( open 7 to 12 pm ) and handily placed for buses , trams and cable cars. The staff seemed pleasant and efficient whenever I had dealings with them , indeed the only quibble I had was that the bell boys at the front were a little undermanned on occasions but I will not let this alter my view of the hotel overall. Don't miss the complimentary drinks and give the Prescatore a visit as it is good value. If you want some breakfast off site then I would recommend the IHOP nearby , although it gets busy at the weekends so you may have to wait. My final thought - 1 recurring image during this week ( 1 Nov - 7 Nov ) was the staff demonstarations outside a number of prominent hotels , many were day long vigils and many were noisy - the good news was that the Tuscan was not 1 of them !", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa City, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Tuscan Inn\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2799753", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Tuscan Inn four nights, from October 16 through the 19th, 2004.

We had booked one room with a King size bed and a sofa bed for our 2 teenagers, thinking that when the sofa bed was put back during the day we would have more space than having 2 Queens. The price prohibited booking 2 rooms, which we had done in Vegas and Anaheim. We regretted it, as once the sofa bed was pulled out there was very little space and the maid did not put it back during the day. The sofa bed only had one blanket and my daughter was cold, so we requested an extra blanket but she was still cold, so we requested a duvet (quilt) but despite asking for it twice it never appeared. We glimpsed rooms containing 2 Queen beds and they seemed to have more space.

This hotel is absolutely brilliant, conveniently situated within walking distance for all tourist activities, The Wharf, Pier 39, cable cars etc. The rooms are very clean, spacious and quiet (ask for a quiet room). The manager's wine reception every evening between 5 - 6pm is a must where you can meet your fellow travellers if you are so inclined. The Cafe Pescatore (adjoining) is a must if you like Italian food. The pizzas and pastas are superb, and the tirasamu is out of this world! All in all, a fantastic hotel and a great location.

We loved the location and were able to walk to take a trolley to all of our desired local destinations. The hotel staff was great and housekeeping went so far as to organize the toiletries I had brough from home and had left scattered on the vanity. Our room decor was cute and given the small size of the room (as is the case with most SF hotel rooms), they used the space well and provided a charming and relaxing atmosphere. I am originally from the Monterey Bay area and my fiance is from Alabama. This was his first trip to CA and he fell in love and had an awesome time. The hotel restaurant is overpriced and average--I would advise venturing out. The only real problem I had was at checkout. I received my bill and paid it and was walking out the door when I noticed it was incorrect. They had overcharged me by at least $600. I turned around and went back to the front desk clerk who informed me that he could not make a correction and give me a refund but handed me a card with accounting's number on it. He advised me to call them once I returned to DC (because they were currently at lunch). Given that he couldn't understand what the error was when I was standing in front of him pointing it out. I was not about to leave and hash it out long distance over the phone. After 15 minutes of refusing to help me and telling me it was beyond his control and out of practice to make corrections at the desk, another woman (a manager?) overheard and asked what the problem was. I explained and she fixed it in 3 minutes and gave me a refund. Perhaps he was still in training or was the kind of person who liked to pretend he knew what he was doing and didn't want to ask for help. Outside of this incident, everyone else was great.

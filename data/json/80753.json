{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Central Location  Summary: Nothing fancy, but a great value, especially if arriving by car.Pros: Helpful front desk; large, clean rooms (ours had fridge  microwave-- but no supplies); central location on bus line; good restaurants nearby; free continental breakfast, wi-fi, and on-site parking.Cons:1) It's best to grab a parking spot when you get there, then walk/commute during your stay. The motel lot is small, and there was shattered safety glass on most nearby streets.... 2) If you don't like stairs, be prepared to wait. One very small, tired, elevator serves 4 floors and about 40 rooms.", "Date": "Aug 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR907833993", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PacificNWM0m"}, {"Content": "Not bad for the price My fiance and I stayed here when we saw The Nutcracker last December. It has a good, central location in downtown SF, in walking distance of good restaurants, the Opera House, and some shopping. The room was comfy and clean and we had a good night's rest.A couple of things: The continental breakfast leaves much to be desired. I was hoping for some freshly cooked food, or at least something semi-healthy, but all they had was a basket of junk food and some coffee. I know it's free, but come on! The other thing is that we never received our 9:00 am wake-up call. We just happened to wake up at around 9:30. When we brought it up to the clerk at check out, he just mumbled something about how the computer takes care of wake-up calls. Other than that, no major complaints!", "Date": "Jan 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR128710733", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tra_lalala"}, {"Content": "Better Than Expected! After some of the reviews I read about this place, I was dreading staying here! However, I was almost completely happy!The location is ok, a bit out of the busy area  if you walk to  from the hotel, you do walk through quite a rough place. It's more than ok during the day, however at night was always made sure we got a cab back.I was happy with the hotel itself. A nice spacious room with 2 comfortable double beds, both clean. A good sized tv with HBO etc. A small attempt at a kitchen ie, sink, fridge  microwave, all were clean. My only issue was the bathroom. The shower, toilet  sink area we fine, clean  in full working order. What was my issue I hear you say!? Well, don't be alarmed but there were ants! Not loads of them but probably 2 or 3 on the bathroom walls. I would not allow this to put you off but I would like to think my review was honest!Other than that, the receptionist was very helpful, gave us directions etc  stored our suitcases on the day we were leaving.For the price, you cannot complain!", "Date": "Jan 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR247635575", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "scoobyju1"}, {"Content": "rooms clean, breakfast could be better Stay was ok, rooms were clean enough, breakfast could have been better, muffins and pastries, juice and coffee.

Perhaps it was the state of the Days Inn that we had stayed in the night before checking in here, but we were surprised and pleased at the rooms at this location. Our room was VERY clean and looked like they had updated the decor a bit to attempt to give it a charming look. The result was that while not high quality decor, it was very nice. The room was comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are HUGE. We peeked in at a jacuzzi room, considering getting one, but the bathrooms are basically the same size and the jacuzzi room just has a bigger bathtub with jets. Really not worth the extra $20, unless you really want to jacuzzi solo.We were on the third floor, but there is a small lift (I say lift rather than elevator, because... it's a lift... and small) so you can get your luggage up easily. You can hear some street noise, or I should say walkway noise, but that's not uncommon in a motel and it wasn't too bad. But we were there at a pretty low capacity time, too.There is limited free parking which is wonderful, but they do only have about 25 spaces. If you were there at a busy time, you might run into a challenge getting a parking spot if you returned late, but while we were there we had no problems and there was plenty of parking. That was a huge relief! It is in walking distance to a few of the sites, mainly to the civic center area, but we had a vehicle, so we drove most everywhere we went leaving me with few recommendations of places to walk to.The staff was very friendly - both the desk folks and the cleaning people were great. As far as the breakfast provided, that inlcuded coffee, juices, and tea and individually wrapped pastries and Otis Spunkmeyer muffins. I think there was some fruit there, too. It wasn't a lot, but it was a nice light breakfast to get started with or a snack until we could eat breakfast. It was also nice to be able to grab a couple extra of the little muffins to take along for snacks while sightseeing. I have very low expectations of complimentary motel breakfasts, so to me it was just fine. If you want a hot breakfast with eggs and french toast, you might want to try a restaurant.All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Civic Cneter Days Inn and will likely use this property again on future visits to San Francisco when we are trying to save a little cash for doing the fun stuff. I recommend this location and if you go in expecting a Days Inn, you'll be pleased at what you get.", "Date": "Jun 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR958812928", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ladyjadegd"}, {"Content": "Pretty good for the price You pay for what you get.

Our room was next door to the laundry facility, which was very convenient. The kitchen was clean and had a small amount of dishes. The bedroom was very small, you can just walk around the bed. There is no extra space in there. But, the bed was comfortable and there were five pillows! There was a tv in the living room and a tv in the bedroom. Yes, the ac unit in the bedroom was noisy. But, I am a very light sleeper and it did not wake me up when it turned off and on. There was adequate free parking and the pool was clean. The breakfast was very good, except the eggs were runny and the coffee was really strong! The staff was friendly and helpful. The elevator was terribly slow so we just took the stairs. There was a good amount of information in our room about nearby restaurants, grocery stores, etc. which was very helpful given the cruddy map we had received from the rental car agency.

As a long time Trip Advisor user, I researched a number of hotels before settling on a property for our first San Diego visit. I booked a good rate directly thru the hotel website. This Residence Inn lived up to its good reviews. We received a friendly welcome upon arrival. We were somewhat concerned as we pulled into the parking lot to see a very large portable generator humming along right next to the lobby. When we checked in we found out that the local utility company shut down power to many local businesses for the first two days of our stay and the hotel obtained a generator so as not to inconvenience guests. The generator was obviously up to the job, because we didn't notice any problems. We had a one bedroom queen suite which was spacious enough for the 3 or us. My 10 year old slept on the sleeper sofa and it was of better quality than many sleepers or rollaways we've had to use before. It would probably fit two children or one adult comfortably. Our bed was very comfortable and having the kitchen (full size fridge, microwave and dishwasher) was a plus. The pool and hot tub were great after a long day of seeing the sights! The property had a mix of families and business travelers. The complimentary breakfast was definitely a step above the standard \"continental\" fare with scrambled eggs, waffles, hashbrowns and variations of sausages, biscuits and gravy and croissants in additional to the more traditional offerings. The property is a good ways from downtown, but with a rental car it was still very convenient to all of the sights (about 15 minutes to each of the major attractions). A good map (or get directions on the complimentary internet access!) and it was pretty easy to get around! Our only complaint (and the ONLY reason we did not rate the property an Excellent) was that the airconditioning unit was pretty loud. The rooms were all very quiet and we didn't hear anything of our neighbors, but at night when the AC cycled on it was enough to wake both my husband and I. We tried turning it off, but the room was too stuffy, so ended up leaving the AC running all night. It was still a bit loud and took some getting used to, but was preferrable to being startled awake each time it kicked on!

Our son has a rare metabolic disorder which requires us to prepare special foods for him, some of which require the use of either a conventional oven or a toaster oven. Just prior to our arrival, my husband inquired about whether the one-bedroom suite we had reserved has one or both, but unfortunately, it has only a microwave oven (which was a big help for other food we had to prepare) and a toaster. When my husband then explained the reason for our inquiry and asked whether there was a Target or Wal-Mart nearby where we could buy a toaster oven, they amazingly offered to go out and buy a toaster oven for us to use. Upon our arrival, we received a warm welcome from the front desk staff, who said they were waiting for us - a new toaster oven/convection oven was already in our room, and a Graco pack-n-play was all set up for our son - both at no extra charge. We then went to their Thursday evening barbeque where the manager asked us if the oven and everything was OK. I cannot believe what personal assistance and attention we received! The front desk staff was always very helpful and friendly. The suite and property were very well maintained and clean. The carpeting in the suite looked brand new, and the bed was very comfortable. We were very pleased with the amount of space we had and the kitchen facility. The suite was much bigger than conventional hotel rooms. There was plenty of room to move around in the living area even with the pack-n-play. The kitchen area had a full-sized fridge with a freezer, dishwasher (which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use), and a small sink, and the cabinets were filled with dishes, a toaster, pots and pans, utensils, etc. - just about everything you would need. Even paper towels were provided. Adjacent to the kitchen was a small dining table and two chairs, and that room also had a desk, sofa, chair, coffee table, and TV (but no DVD player - we brought our own portable player). The bedroom also had a TV. The furniture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy, but that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a priority for us. The housekeeping staff thoroughly cleaned our suite early each morning after we left, and they were very friendly and polite and very kind to our son. Our suite overlooked the pool and basketball/tennis court, but our rooms were still quiet enough for our son to fall asleep in the early evening when children and adults were outside playing and swimming. Our suite was next to the elevator - I wish they could turn down the volume of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ding ding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that plays every time the elevator arrives. We slept so soundly though that it did not wake us up. The air conditioner is located in the bedroom and was a bit loud, although it too did not keep us awake. The parking spaces are a bit tight, but unlike other Residence Inns in the area, there was no separate parking charge. The breakfast buffet was free and much more extensive than I had expected. It certainly filled us up and saved us a lot of time and money each day. My husband enjoyed making the two of us Belgian waffles each morning - they sometimes even had blueberry or chocolate batter. Also available were muffins, donuts, bread, bagels, fruit (which was also available throughout the day), yogurt, scrambled eggs, potatoes, several types of cereal, three juices, coffee, skim and reduced-fat milk, and another hot selection such as biscuits and gravy, taco shells, pancakes, french toast, etc. Three high chairs were available for little ones. The staff members working in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gatehouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during meal times were very friendly and kept the food replenished and the tables quickly cleared and cleaned. Light meals were available Monday through Thursday evenings. We particularly enjoyed the Thursday barbeques which included grilled burgers, veggie burgers, and hot dogs, potato salad, watermelon, chips, soft drinks, beer, and wine. Music was playing outside; the volume could be reduced so that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so loud for those who are napping or working in their rooms. Another night there were french bread pizzas, which weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best - they could be baked longer, and salad. The next night they had meatball sandwiches and salad, which were fine after a long day at the Zoo and the beach (although rolls other than hamburger buns would be an improvement). After a long day it was nice to just grab something quick (and free) to eat. We went to the San Diego Zoo several times, having purchased a membership on-line a few weeks before, which is good for 14 months and is also good at the Wild Animal Park. Membership more than paid for itself with just those few visits. Given our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s young age and the heat and humidity, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to stay at the Zoo or Animal Park all day, so it was great to have the membership card to come and go as we pleased. It took us only 25 minutes to drive to the Zoo each morning between 8:30 and 9:30. The Animal Park was just a 35-minute drive. Torrey Pines State Park beach was just 10 or 15 minutes away, except during evening rush hour when it could take about 20 minutes just to drive the short distance from the hotel to the highway, which was a bit frustrating. La Jolla beach was about a 20-minute drive. Beautiful Coronado beach was about 30 minutes away. The front desk gave us cards with directions to each destination, which was a big help. While I wish there was a kiddie pool, our son absolutely loved swimming in the fair-sized pool, which was never very crowded despite a soccer tournament group and other groups being there during our stay. Towels were available pool-side. The property is located in an office/commercial area, but it is not far off of the 805 and is centrally located to the various attractions and nice beaches. Two grocery stores (Vons and Ralphs) and a Target are a short drive away, and there are numerous restaurants and fast-food places within a short driving distance. The front desk even directed us to a nice public playground nearby, which our son loved. There was one computer available off of the lobby for guests to use, but the internet connection was so painfully slow that we did not use it. There were many other families there, with kids of all ages, and there were also business travelers present too. We were very pleased with our stay at this Residence Inn and hope to return soon.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cClean, useful features, but not luxurious\u201d", "Author": "alexsndiego", "ReviewID": "UR4367981", "Content": "We stayed at the Residence Inn Sorrento Valley in mid-January '06.

Aside from that, the staff was very willing to please and pleasant to deal with. I found the location to be pretty good.

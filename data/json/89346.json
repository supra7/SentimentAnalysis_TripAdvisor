Check in was a mess as we had four women in our group they told us all they had was a room with a king bed. The staff was rude and basically told us this is all they have. We stood our ground and they finally got us a room with two double beds. We had also earlier in the week, prior to our arrival, asked a refrigerator for our room and they said no problem. Well we stayed there four days and everyday we would call requesting the refrigerator and they would say \"no problem we will send one right up,\" but it never arrived! Our room was in the north tower on the 19th floor. The bathroom was small and dated. When you took a shower (and yes the shower curtain was inside the tub) there would appear water on the carpet outside of the bathroom. You could hear everything going on outside from people screaming and yelling to police in the street on their speakers. This happened almost nightly! Our room was also a sauna. It was so hot and we had to call maintenance up twice to fix the thermostat. The first night they fixed it and even changed the air filter that looked like it had not been changed in months. It was filthy! They did set up food for our volleyball team to purchase in the morning on the way out,but it was nothing special...dry bagels..cereal...coffee, etc. The only bright spot of our stay here at this hotel was American Limo service who was available to drive you to the convention center or to local area restaraunts at a very very reasonable price. The vehicles were clean and the drivers courteous and friendly. I would recommend using their service and not walking alone at night.

My pillows had blood on them from the bedbugs, and I am personally traumatized from the bites and unexplained bleeding and bumps I left there with. This hotel is outdated, and between the two towers (and who knows how many rooms), there are only 3 washers (2 working) and 3 dryers. While I was there, I had to wash clothes between 2:00 and 4:00am in order to find an available washer/dryer in the laundry room. My company had numerous problems, all of which received a response that was only geared towards keeping our organization from voiding their contract with this place. Was it terrible staying here? YES, and it was an endurance test. Sometimes the rooms didn\u2019t get cleaned. The conference rooms were hot, poorly lit, and ventilated with the stench of this old dilapidated building\u2019s basement smells. The public bathrooms were rarely cleaned and smelled like pure p$%&. We endured this and more, and received no points for it? We should have received points, free gifts, an apology, a back rub, and FREE BED BUG CREAM!!! Upon arriving, we were told that we would receive Starwood points for our stay if we could provide a Starwood membership number. Later, we were told, \"Since your company paid for the room in your name, points cannot be granted.\" OK, other hotels in the area that housed employees from my organization provided points, so why not Starwood? Personally, I believe this is their way of saying, \"don't stay here next time!\" No problem! I would like to ask that anyone belonging to my organization (you know who you are) please let the folks who decide to pay substandard hotels such as this, such astronomical $$$$ to simply STOP!!!

The parking garage across the street is easy to get into, as you approach the Sheraton there is an entrance to the garage in the middle of the street, you can't miss it. Also the garage is very well lit and you need your parking ticket to get into the elevator lobby to retrieve your car. Checking-in: I booked on Priceline, great rate so no complaints there. The front desk employee was nice so I asked for a corner room. She said due to booking on Priceline it would be an extra $30 a night...then when I mentioned I was a Sheraton Preferred Guest Gold member she varified and upgrading us for free and gave us two cookies. The Room: Our room was in the North Tower, room #1010. The room had one, comfortable, king bed, a large desk, flat screen tv, a comfy chair and a good amount of lights. The bathroom was small but workable, the water pressure was not good, when are hotels going to figure out people want good water flow in hotel rooms. The furnishings were all in ok condition. We were however a little surprised that the desk's legs were not attched to the desk and could easily be removed. Another thing why does Sheraton put such large desks in their small rooms. The not so good...the room was cold, even when we turned the heat up to 75 degrees it still felt cold at times. The one-pane windows were most likely the cause of heat loss and also the cause of the noise you could hear from outside. Really one-pane windows, Sheraton wake up. Yes expensive to replace all the windows, but you would save overall by installing new windows and saving on the heating/cooling costs. The windows need to be changed out either way. Overall the room was good enough for a couple nights...but again it needs some renovation. The location: It felt like it was right on the border of a good area and an ok area. Our room faced the \"ok\" area. There is a bar and restaurant across the street that had interesting activity late at night, people yelling, honking horns and the usual drunken activities. Overall for the price I paid I was ok with the hotel...but most likely wouldn't pay the going hotel website price for this hotel. I think the owners need to do some renovation, starting with the windows...then maybe the going price will be worth it.

We were scared to park our car elsewhere as we were afraid it was going to be broken into. So for the first night, we paid for valet parking. The valet was $34 per night (pretty expensive in my opinion for a Sheraton hotel located in a crappy neighborhood but they probably charged so much since its in Baltimore and still a tourist attraction area). The hotel room was small compared to other Sheraton brand hotels I've stayed in. The hotel lobby was okay, nothing special but considering it's a category 3 hotel...you wouldn't expect a lot out of it. We were placed on the 10th floor and we can hear people in the next room talking and doors banging loudly in our hotel room. The pool was nice and we swam there during our stay. There was a lifeguard on duty and the water was clean. My one complaint about the pool area was that most of the chairs there were broken or had a ripe on them. Also there was a shortage of chairs to accommodate their hotel guests, we woke up extra early to be able to get a lounge chair every morning. THe gym was pretty decent size and had a variety of equipments. The hotel was about 6 blocks away from Inner Harbor so it was within walking distance. Watch out for your personal belongings as you are walking because there are lots of bums in the area and overall Baltimore is not a safe city. For the second night, we parked across the street in the self parking garage downstairs and we paid $10 for parking instead. Elevators were a bit freaky and old, but you had to use your car ticket in order to enter the elevator to go downstairs from the street level to pick up your card (a bit safer so this way strangers won't be allowed in). As a SPG member, I've stayed in various Sheraton brand hotel and would not recommend this one.

Our room on the 18th floor was a corner unit with a king bed. The duvet was crazy heavy, to the point that it was dragged off the bed by it's own weight during the night. A small but clean bathroom, a desk with an office chair, a flat-screen TV, mini-fridge with nothing in it, an awkwardly placed closet, and a comfortable bed completed the room, but no extra pillows or a blanket (to use instead of the duvet). When I was there the hotel was experiencing a \"internet is down\" situation that made it impossible to access the web from the computers in the Business Center. After trying several times to access the internet in order to print out boarding passes for the next days flight, I made my way to the front desk, who then told me about the (apparent) hotel-wide internet blackout. Once I explained what I wanted to do, they directed me to the Concierge computer and let me use that. While it took a while to get the printing done (wait in line again, then tell front desk folks that the printing wasn't working, then have them futz around and confer with each other), the staff did make it happen.

But we found both to be adequate. The room and bed were clean and comfortable and the furnishings were in good repair. The hallways were quite warm, though. We were treated well at check-in and by the concierge. We did not use the pool but we walked through the pool area and thought it looked very attractive. No, the hotel is not in the middle of urban blight as some have said. Some reviewers have advised to not walk north or west. Maybe the advice should be to not walk north AND west. We walked a few blocks west (to Starbucks at W. Baltimore and S. Eutaw) and the area was fine. As for the walk between the hotel and the inner harbor or the ballpark, it took us 8 or 9 minutes. Whether this is a burden will depend upon your degree of fitness and the weather. We did not find the location to be inconvenient to the tourist attractions although we would have preferred, of course, to be closer to the inner harbor. For more distant destinations I highly recommend using the free Charm City Circulator buses which run about every 15 minutes. Yes, parking is expensive -- particularly so if you use the hotel parking. As you near the front of the hotel heading west on W. Fayette St. you may think the hotel parking is the garage that has an entrance ramp right in the middle of the street. That's what I thought so I parked there. In reality the hotel parking is elsewhere -- the entrance is around two corners on W. Baltimore St. Where I parked is less expensive -- I paid $18/day -- than the hotel parking, several dollars less on most days. But you can do better: There is a garage on W.

What I liked about the room is the large flat-screen TV, and nice desk and comfortable desk chair; the huge wall-sized window with nice heavy curtains over a privacy curtain; the absolutely most comfortable bed I've ever slept in with 4 huge of the most comfortable pillows (King bed); a nice big dressing mirror next to the closet; the electric thermostat which responds and cools/heats immediately; and the 'modern' look of the bathroom. What I didn't like about the room was the carpet needs cleaning very bad, the price - at the business rate it was $144 before tax (I'm not sure I would want to pay much more for the regular rate); the bath towels are a little too bleachy (had to wash my face and arms a couple of times after drying); and there aren't any premium movie channels on the television - - they push their pay per view movies. Iffy about the room is the shower - it's a tiled stand-up shower with a curtain, no tub. Wasn't really an issue for me but if a tub is important to you for whatever reason know ahead there is not one. Iffy about the hotel for me was at check-in they tried to sell me on changing my room preference to two beds, and the reasoning they gave me (bigger room) just didn't prove to be true and they tried to lure me with promises of 'try to find' a better room for me the next day (I didn't give up my king bed but have had the opportunity to view other rooms). Also, I am on business rate, but my window view is half concrete roof, my coworkers also have crappy views. If I were on vacation I would be somewhat disappointed because 1) there are hotels nearer the Harbour (which is where all the activity is) including another Sheraton (it's about a 25 minute slow-paced walk from here, and remember later at night its iffy if you should be out and about on foot) and 2) there are other hotels that are higher up having many views of the Harbour. If I was going to spend this kind of money, i'd even spend a little more and go for location to the Harbour and a hotel that might could promise me a good view. I'd recommend this as a good business hotel. They also have a nice business center. I stayed here for a conference. Let me say right now that if you're planning a conference, make sure this hotel can handle the capacity you anticipate. This one seemed to have difficulty with the size conference I'm at - - the rooms are wall to wall table, leg to leg chairs, stuffy, not sound-proof from next door rooms, and the conference area at classroom transition resembles Hollywood Boulevard on a Premier night.

I will try to give an objective and honest review which will help the travelers and hotel: Cons: 1. Bed bugs: I have checked in to a room in the North tower. The check in was on time. The first room looked ok, but pillows and duvet had stains of blood that dried long time ago. It looks liked being washed, but clearly the blood did not go away. I have reported the problem and the cleaning staff replaced the duvet and the pillows on the same day. I did not open my luggage. I went to bed only in underwear. Soon, I have noticed a bed bug on a second pillow. The bed bug came out from the edge of the bed from the mattress. I have quickly taken a new band aid and carried alive the bed bug to the front desk. The staff member was quite surprised, but he quickly gave me new room and apologized for the inconvenience. He started making a report for the hotel and assured the room will be closed down for an investigation. When I returned to room, I saw another bed bug on the pillow that came out again from the mattress/bed edge. I have taken the bed bug alive back to the front desk. He has again apologized and said he will report it in his report. This was around midnight. Next, I have checked in to another room in the North tower. There were 2 beds. On both beds the pillows had stains of blood that dried up, but clearly the pillows looked washed. I was afraid now to even sleep on the bed. I slept for 1 hour on a chair, but I was so tired I went to a bed after removing all pillows and duvet. There was only 1 sheet and mattress. Around 3:00 a.m. in the morning I have woken up to notice another bed bug in a distance of 5-10 cm away from me coming from the mattress/bed edge. I have again brought it back to the front desk and have been given another room. Luckily, I did not even open my luggage. So, I went to a third room in the South tower. In the third room, I was again afraid to sleep on the bed due to previous shocking experience with bed bugs in 2 other rooms. I tried to sleep on a chair all night, but I could not sleep at all on a chair. The room had stains of blood and mascara on the bed, towels and walls. Next, morning I have checked out. The front desk manager offered to dry clean all my clothes and bags, but I did not even open them when I checked in. However, they have mentioned this could help me to avoid bringing any bed bugs home. I think bed bugs spread in the whole building by the duvet, sheets and pillows replaced between rooms and cleaning department. Bed bugs from the pillows and duvet spread to the cleaning department and then brought to other rooms. Or by the clothes of other clients who brought their clothes for cleaning to the bell captain's desk. I had to change several rooms in less than 12 hours due to bed bugs. I could not even sleep properly and was tired and exhausted after this stay. 2. The carpets, walls, towels, duvet, sheets, pillows, the sofa have stains of blood, mascara, or other liquids. Clearly, there is a problem with cleaning and bed bugs. 3. The rooms are quite sound proof, but you can still hear some noise of the sirens of emergency cars. This was not a big problem as bed bugs though. 4. Some of walls and ceiling had certain problems. They were patched or falling down. However, this was not as bad as bed bugs again. Pros: 1. The staff and hotel manager are generally nice, friendly and helpful. They offered their help whenever they can. When the incident with bed bugs happened, they have offered to dry clean the cloths and luggage to make sure I will not bring it home. 2. I was offered a full refund and there was no problem with billing. So, the billing is done fast and efficiently. 3. The wireless internet is fast. There is an option to pay by hour, day and week. Although, it would have been better to have it for free as part of hotel membership like some other places do. 4. Location is good. There is a downtown and inner harbor near by. Although, after 8 p.m. you may see more homeless and strange people in the downtown area, but this is a more of a problem for the whole Baltimore in general. Inner Harbor was nice though during the day. It has some interesting places to visit around. 5. The concierge was helpful and knowledgeable as well. She tried to explain and guide to the best places to visit. 6. The first floor of the hotel looked nice. Recommendation to the Hotel: - Rooms should be checked for bed bugs and be disinfected at least every week not every 5 or 6 months. This will make sure such incidents do not happen. Although, the aftermath of the incident was handled well, but the preventive measures need to be addressed and improved drastically to avoid such problems. - The stained items (e.g. duvet, pillows, sheets) needs to be replaced more efficiently. Although, washing was done on these items, but the stain still remains. This looked very disgusting. Recommendation for Guest: - clearly check your pillows and linen for blood stain as this could be a first sign of the previous bed bug presence.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cVery Friendly, nicely placed\u201d", "Author": "In79days", "ReviewID": "UR116587374", "Content": "NIce hotel, and very helpful and friendly staff.

My party ended up in a single room at the Sheraton for Otakon 2011, a local Japanese animation convention. Beyond the great location, the front desk hotel staff were great. The check in was efficient, quick, and very well taken care of despite the masses of people there. We arrived at 6:45, we had our car taken care of and we were in our room at 7:10.

Further, their platinum club lounge (as the one who booked the room was a platinum club member) was superb. The food was great, the people were wonderful. Finally, their bag check was efficient, well run, and very good. On the other hand, there were many many issues. First and foremost, our bathroom flooded. It happens. They were quick in fixing it but it's still an issue. They also forgot our towels one day, though they did deliver new ones upon being told. Their website was also very inaccurate as it advertised free wireless internet in the common areas despite there being no such service. On top of that, they lacked a book of amenities in the room and did not provide one; being hungry at 3 AM and wishing for room service or some sort of map, we were unable to procure one. The website was also very unhelpful, lacking hours and locations of things. Finally, it seemed that getting a card remagnitized without all four cards there would reset all cards and prevent them from working, meaning that by the end of the trip, we had only a single working card and no real means of obtaining new working ones. The neutral in this case was the room situation. We had 4 people in a room, one of which did not wish to share the bed and as he was paying, one had to sleep on the floor, me.

We booked this hotel because it was 2 blocks away from the convention center which was very nice. We arrived Thursday afternoon. The check in process was easy, and pretty fast considering all of the con-goers arriving for the weekend. The room was pretty nice. But the air conditioning was not working and we had to call the front desk. The maintenance man was very quick to respond and fixed the a/c unit in a matter of minutes. We used the self park option instead of the valet, and the parking lot was full. I'm not sure how their lot could have been full, but we found a public lot that was cheaper since the Sheraton did not provide free parking. Our main disappointment was with the wording on the web site. I did not book the trip, so I can't say what was or was not there, however the paperwork we had said high speed internet was a room accommodation, however you had to pay $12.95 per day and because of the poor wording we were expecting to have wi-fi service included. When I checked the site from my smart phone it stated that it was $9.95 per day, and when i attempted to access the internet on my iPod it said it was $12.95 just as the front desk stated. I do not recall seeing anything on the site stating that the price was subject to change. The hotel did have a free internet connection just off of the lobby, however there were only 2 desktop and 2 ethernet connections available, which, with the type of convention that was being held, would be hard to gain access to.

There is a big flatscreen tv but everything takes so long to load up. The phone was blinking with a message. It was a message from the staff wishing some other guest Happy July 4th. One would think messages get cleared when people check out. I wasn't impressed with the housekeeping department. The clock was blinking and never set. The one time they did clean my room, the bedside table and phone still seemed dusty and there was still strands of hair on the shower wall. The 2nd night housekeeping didn't bother cleaning my room at all(I read another review where someone also experienced this). I had returned to my room so late, I decided to go to sleep and forego the mediocre cleaning service. The next morning when I told the front desk receptionist, Jazarry M., she glares at me and says, \"Did you put up the do not disturb?\" I tell her I did not and ask if it is the hotel policy to clean every other day. She stares blankly and says nothing. At the very LEAST she could have apologized. And excellent customer service would have offered me a free night parking or something. There happened to be a conference there with lots of teens and 20 something people and I could hear them down the halls. The walls are so thin and I heard someone vomiting all night in the room next to me. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Pool and gym Pool is nice and outdoors on the cabana level in the north tower. However it was corded off separating the shallow from deep and this prevented one from doing laps and it tended to be a bit crowded. But I must admit it was 109 degrees when I was there. The gym is clean and nice with available towels in the gym. General surroundings The neighboring streets are dingy, with panhandlers. Its not a place you make obvious that you are new to the area especially as female traveling alone as I was. I opted to park in the valet parking which is $34US/day and you can take the car in and out as often as you like without additional charges. I did see other garages that charged $12US/day about a block away. The neighboring restaurants seemed dingy.

The conference was during a time when the hotel was at capacity because Bono (U2) was in town and the Orioles had home games...it was packed! During the second day of my stay, two major transformers in downtown Baltimore blew causing a major power outage at the hotel. The hotel desk staff and management JUMPED into action! While the outage was completely out of the hotel's control...NOT THEIR FAULT people...they went out of their way to take care (to the best of their ability) of each guest's need. It is true that anything electrical did not work including making (electrical) keys, toilets, water and air conditioning, BUT..the hotel broke out bottled water, wine, beer, trays and trays of food for guests waiting in the lobby and apologized over and over and over. It was a difficult day for everyone involved but, the hotel management did their VERY BEST to accommodate any need of their guests. After the power was restored, management was vacuuming and doing everything possible to restore the hotel after the crisis.They even gave free internet to guests because their system was rebooting and their were difficulties. Our event was interrupted by the power outage (no power point programs for our speaker) but, came off smoothly because we were so well taken care of. Our attendees (250) felt very cared for by this hotel considering the power outage was OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. Personally, my room was clean, comfortable and consistent with Sheraton standards....very nice! The desk staff (Alicia most especially) was so professional and caring to me and those from my conference checking in and out. The GM, Chris was delightful and worked his tail off the full five days I stayed. He had a wonderful attitude and rolled his sleeves up and did all he could during the power outage crisis...and once power was restored, he got everything running smoothly in the hotel, very quickly! Pat Palmere who we worked with to set up and run the conference is INCREDIBLE. Her professionalism and positive attitude in all circumstances make this hotel OUTSTANDING. I visited the historic area...FREE art museum two blocks up, Inner Harbor and an Oriole game (walked to and from and felt completely safe). I like the location of the hotel and always felt safe walking to and from the Inner Harbor and the Camden Yards. I believe the area is not any different than other big city areas (Chicago, Dallas, Vegas, Charlotte, SF....etc.), in safety. I used the gorgeous pool (they even have a lifeguard ON DUTY) but not the work-out room although many of my fellow conferees did and raved about it! Loved lunch and dinner at the restaurant and the conference breakfast and lunch buffets were scrumptious...kudos to the chef! When I read other reviews I am perplexed by what people write. The lobby staff is gushing with friendliness and smiles and helpfulness, the rooms are ample size in a downtown city hotel and are tastefully decorated, neat and clean. The lobby is lovely, common areas are tastefully decorated and elevators are fast. I am not sure what people are complaining about...I travel often and this is a great hotel! When our organization returns to Baltimore, The Sheraton Baltimore City Center will be our hotel of choice. The power outage was not the hotel's fault and yet they went above and beyond necessary means to make everyone comfortable.

Parking is limited in Baltimore, so we are parked across the street in a parking garage. Self park is $19 a day, valet park is $28 a day. The lobby is spacious and clean, you can easily get a taxi, but we found the 6 block walk refreshing. 3 blocks to the right, then 3 blocks next right, and you're at The Harbor. The rooms here are \"miniature\" - ours was clean, comfortable bed, decent view, outdated bathroom, but still clean with plenty of towels, big screen TV. I would have liked a small refrigerator for wine, or leftovers, or cheese and fruit we bought at the Farmers Market, but there isn't a fridge. The rooms are quite small - we are average size people, but I think large people would be claustrophobic, particularly in the bathroom. You can hardly turn around in there, and there is little room beside the bed. Funny thing was that the full length mirror was on the wall right next to the bed, so you'd actually have to stand on the bed, or the other side of the room to see yourself. No lamp on the desk. There is an ice/wine bucket, and small coffeepot with Starbucks coffee. For our purposes, we were fine - we wanted close, clean, basic, and good price - that is what we got. If you want closer, fancy, more amenities, look elsewhere. We would definitely recommend, and would stay here again. There is a Shula's restaurant in the hotel but we didn't eat there. We ate at the Harbor - so many food choices there.Highly recommended - Phillips Seafood Kitchen, Mo's Crab and Pasta in Little Italy, Rusty Scupper. We took the water taxi all over for $10 a day. Great shopping, great city tours and boat tours, you can find out everything you need to know in the Visitors Center where there are clean restrooms. At the hotel, internet access is $13 a day in your room, but there are four computers in the lobby that you can use free. At one point we needed towels, at another point we needed a corkscrew - both were provided immediately.

I clicked yes and a screen popped up letting me know that they would send an email within 48 hours if \"space\" was available for the club lounge. I never received an email. When we checked in, I explained that we wanted the club lounge access. I was told that the club lounge was not open on weekends. Guess I wished they would somehow fix the web site so that the option doesn't come up when you book a weekend room.

I was aware the rooms do not have a bathtub, but I was surprised how big the shower was. Also there was no fridge, but the ice machine was right outside my door.

I know I did not pay for the rooms on my sides, but even the front desk girl who checked me in later acknowledged that yes, one of the negatives of my upgraded room is that is connected to 2 other rooms. I just got the feeling that the hotel wasn't exactly fully occupied, so it's not like they could not have left the room next to me vacant. If I had to choose between an upgrade and a room not connected to another room, I would always pick the latter, since I have had bad experiences with connected rooms. But since I got used to the upgraded room and wasn't staying long, I did not ask for another room. I personally don't understand why they have connected rooms. If a family wants to stay in a hotel, why not just book a suite, why have connected rooms? I must say I am disappointed it had to end this way. I guess it was too good to be true, that I was given a wonderful room for one day, and that I couldn't have a 2nd good day. But hotels are always like that.

I returned to this location as it became the Sheraton, and I had an amazing deal of $99/night which is a rate that the staff were shocked that I got! The rooms are lovely and clean. What impressed me most were the staff. Specifically there was a man who helped arrange for my parcels to be brought up to my room. It took awhile, so he waived most of the charges for shipping parcels to the hotel. On the final day, they messed up my checkout bill (I was charged valet parking and don't even have a car), the same man was on shift and he came to the front desk with me and helped clear all the funny charges on my bill. And every day, I was happily greeted with smiling faces by all of the staff. Whenever I asked for additional blankets and towels, the staff were extremely helpful. This had to have been my best hotel experience and I frequently stay at hotels. I was very impressed, especially with the terrible experience I had at this location when it was formerly the Wyndham.

The rooms were a good size and had all the amenities you needed including a full sized hairdryer which the ladies will appreciate. The staff at the hotel were always polite and extremely helpful. I had several questions about the services at the hotel and they were able to answer them quickly and professionally. The only downside to the rooms is that the walls/doors were a little on the thin side as we could hear the neighbors come in and out. We had an adjoining room so this may have accented the problem. Just something to be mindful of. The hotel had pretty much all the amenities you would expect at a 3 star downtown hotel. We didn't use the fitness center so I don't know how good it was but everything in the hotel was clean and well maintained. If you plan to use the swimming pool you will need to do it early as it closes at 8pm. This was a little disappointing for us but by no means a deal breaker. As with any downtown hotel in a metropolitan area there are parking charges for guests. The hotel has a parking garage but if you want to save some money use the parking garage across the street from the main lobby. To access the garage you will go down the ramp in the middle of Fayette street (it is almost right in front of the hotel). On weekends it is only $10 per day compared to the $19+ the hotel will charge. As other reviewers have mentioned there is a little diner across the street from the hotel called Tony's Diner. I would advise you to avoid this little gem. We left 15 minutes after being seated and not even getting our drinks. The staff there paid no attention to us and probably didn't even notice we had left. The sad part is that they had 2 waitresses and only 7 tables with patrons so it wasn't like they were terribly busy. There are alternatives nearby so you won't go hungry. About 300 feet from the hotel's front door is a Burger King and there is a Dunkin Donuts and a 7-11 a block away on the corner of Baltimore and S Howard Street (on the other side of 1st Mariner Arena). If none of these suits you then you can eat at the hotel's restaurants or go to the inner harbor. In summary I was happy with my stay at the Sheraton.

ID was also needed, and was a big problem when i had to go downstairs for a small emergency at 2 am with nothing but pajamas, flip flops, and a de-activated key. after 7 deactivated room keys, i became terribly frustrated to the point i could no longer muster up a polite facade for the front desk. it seemed like every time i needed to get into my room, i needed to report to the front desk to ask for a key, much like a small child asking the permissions of his parents. as an adult, i find this process highly unneccesary and a great hassle. i was reminded time and time again i should not keep my hotel room key near my credit cards, cell phone(s), any electronic devices, any metal objects, and PENS. the employees also blamed the baltimore convention center for de-activating my keys, which could very well be the case. but if it were the case, then why didn't everyone who was staying here and went into the convention center have key problems? why didn't 30,000 more people have this problem who all stepped foot into the convention center have key problems? and.... pens? cell phones and electronic devices are understandable, but pens and metal objects? are your keys really so sensitive to tiny pieces of metal with barely any magnetism to be deactivated SEVEN TIMES by the metal of the ball point pen in my bag? nonsense. i have traveled all over the world and stayed in various hotels, visit baltimore yearly and have stayed in every hotel in the inner harbor with the exception of the hyatt and the intercontinental, and i have NEVER had this problem before. not only that, when i attempted to illustrate how far away i keep my keys from my cellphone and credit cards, i had a glass object in the bottom of my nylon bag. i put the bag down a bit too hard on the counter (my fault) and the glass hit the marble, making a loud \"clink\"-ing sound. a nearby gust services employee stepped between the me and the employee i was speaking with, and told me to leave the premises because i was being violent by \"slamming\" my bag into the counter and was going to call security. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? if that was a joke, it was not funny at all. never have i EVER experienced something like this before. it is utterly ridiculous! what terrible service, and accusing me of violence because something in my bag hit the counter and made a loud sound. after the ordeal, i was further interrogated to make sure i i didn't put my keys in xyz place which MAY have de-activated it, etc. may i remind you this is the 7th time i had to go through this. the hotel should really have a file on who has bad room keys or a broken sensor/lock on the door. it would be so much easier than having to waste 5-10 minutes every time i need to re-enter my room. i felt the hotel was very disorganized in this aspect, and i really did not appreciate having to go through that, therefore i will not stay at the sheraton again by my own free will. in plain speak bullets for your ease of reading a re-cap: -i feel like i was treated like a prisoner, a child, a retard, and generally sh*t all around. -i have one more night in this room and i really do hope my hotel keys will not de-activate before i check out tomorrow afternoon. - the sheraton will never be a choice in hotels for me again - i have no desire to pay for a room which i am unable to access for the duration of my stay - i am so glad i am not paying the full price for this room because $500/night is so not worth the money to be going through this. - the price that i am paying for this room is STILL not worth going through what i have gone through during my stay. i could pay much less to stay at a motel and get better courtesy and service than i got at the SHERATON.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cVery satisfied!!\u201d", "Author": "Rondo_MA", "ReviewID": "UR73408587", "Content": "I booked through Hotline ($69/night) and then checked here to see reviews.

The front desk called our room a few hours after we checked in to make sure everything was to our liking and to see if we needed anything. We received a second call from Housekeeping to make sure the rollaway bed had been delivered. All the staff we dealt with were particularly friendly and helpful, every staff person we passed greeted us warmly - it made me wonder if there was a campaign in place to counter some of the negative staff comments that had been left here.

They told me a refrigerator could be supplied at an additional cost of $20 per night, which I found ridiculous. The gym was good, two rooms full of lots of cardio equipment and limited weights and machines, but the major problem there was the temperature. The place was like an oven, and on my final day there, the water coolers were both empty. Staff brought in water bottles, but they disappeared quickly. The pool was small but popular.

It was the Sunday before Memorial Day, I had to travel on Memorial Day out of Baltimore Airport, so I'd figure I drive in a day early and have fun in the city. What a below average experience: 1) Parking was a nightmare. The selfpark garage for the Sheraton only allows SUVs to park on the first level. Meaning if there are no spots you cannot go down lower levels, however you ONLY find that out after you are down there and there are cars behind you looking to park. Thankfully, a Valet guy was walking buy and was able to hop in and back my SUV up through the narrowest of alleys and garner me a spot that Houdini would have had difficulty finding. Unreal. I tipped him a few bucks for his effort. I have never seen a more dysfunctional parking garage, especially for $24 a day 2) The rooms are beat up. Old furniture, shower had plenty of mildew and ancient wallpaper in the bathroom. And it was clear the toilet had not been cleaned if you get my drift. Also the rooms were cramped. Could not see how two people could fit with any comfort. Oh, and there was a hole in my window, not a crack but a physical hole. Yes, a hole the size of a thumb at the base. It looked like it has been there for a while. Have some pride and fix that management 3) Elevators. LOL. Be prepapred for a 5-10 minute wait and I am not kidding. I was on the top floor and it was frustrating waiting 5-10 minutes just to get to your room 4) Margarita at the hotel bar was $9. LOL. Those are NYC prices The crowd in the hotel that night was painfully obnoxious, though I do not blame the hotel for that. There was a Heavy Metal concert in Baltimore which attracted some of the most bizarre people I have ever seen. Not sure why 25 years olds cover themselves with tatoos. You realize one day you will be 40 and will look even more stupid? Lots of heavy metal people loitering around in black tee shirts with dyed black hair The Lacross championships were also in town, so there were a lot of drunk college kids in the hotel, but oh well. That actually brought back memories being drunk in college. I am sure I annoyed plenty of 40 year sold business men in my college days. LOL. I walked down to HarborBay which is a few blocks away. That was a good time, though the seafood I had was terrible down there. You'd think on the water they could learn how to cook shrimp. Just a lousy experience.

Although my stay wasn't as bad as some people's experiences (after reading some of the earlier posts about crimes, etc. occurring at the hotel), I would not give this hotel a high rating. The restaurant, Shula's 2, is ridiculously overpriced ($12 for a simple breakfast of two eggs, bacon and hash browns, about the same quality as you'd get at Denny's for half that price; and $35-$40 for a steak of any kind at dinner), and takes full advantage of the fact that you are pretty much a captive audience because the nearest decent restaurant is at least 10 blocks away. Likewise, pay-per-view movies are $15.00, more than you would pay to see it at a theater. The room was ok but very noisy due to traffic outside, and the fact that my room was near the ice machine did not help matters (the walls are extremely thin, so sounds from the hallway are loudly audible). The swimming pool was closed (probably an outdoor pool, because it was only open from May-September). The hotel information packet is a tacky stapled-together sheet of papers, and the Shula's restaurant menu is not available in the rooms. Don't use the hotel room phones, even local calls are very expensive (I just used my cell phone for everything). To top it off, security is very lax, and I saw several obviously homeless people walk right in off the streets and into the hotel, and nobody stopped them. A colleague of mine said she was sitting in Shula's having lunch when a homeless man came up to her and asked her for money, and another colleague said a shady looking guy came up to her on the floor where her room was and asked her for a date! Not at all what you'd expect from a \"fancy\" hotel. It helped that I had several friends attending the conference with me, including a guy friend who often walked me to my room. My friend had a car and said the parking was exorbitantly expensive, and also that he was afraid to take his car out anywhere because he could lose his parking space (parking was not guaranteed to guests). The only good things were proximity to the waterfront tourist attractions (about a 15 minute walk from the Aquarium, USS Constellation, little Italy) and the fact that the rooms were clean and well-appointed, with comfortable beds, good TV service, nice view, etc. (except for the noise).

My daughter and I booked a room here for one night. We were going to the Springsteen concert at the Mariner Arena and even though we only live about an hour away, we decided to spend the next day at the Inner Harbor. We parked right under the hotel (somewhat expensive $22, but it was convenient and safe). Hotel residents DO have in-and-out privileges. The hotel staff were extremely friendly from start to finish. We were greeted warmly, given a goodie bag with a bottled water, apple, and Hershey bar, and went to our room. The room was absolutely immaculate and very fresh looking. The Springsteen concert had booked both this hotel and the other nearby hotels solid. We felt completely safe walking to and from the concert - the area was well-lit and this hotel is just steps across the street from the Arena. Some people in other posts complained about some boarded up stores. Yeah, there are a couple, but if you know Baltimore, you know that this is how it is - the neighborhoods can change street to street. Use common sense and you will be fine. The next morning we had breakfast in the Shula 2 dining room. Really nice buffet with an omelet and waffle station, lovely fruit, meats, potatoes, etc. with orange juice and coffee included. Pricey? Maybe, but it is a restaurant in a hotel, so not unusually so - $16.95 per person for all you could eat. We ate a big breakfast and skipped lunch to have dinner at the harbor later in the day. I can't say enough about the staff. I have traveled extensively and this staff was friendly, helpful, and always available. They walked up to you and asked if there was anything they could do for you. By the time I got to the hotel door, I think I was asked three times by three different staff members if they could do something for me. Excellent! We were on the 18th floor - beautiful view. No noisier than any other hotel in a city. It is a short walk to the Inner Harbor, but we elected to move the car to a closer daily parking garage since we would be leaving after our visit there.

When we went to check out , the manager, in front of about 20 people, accused us of smoking pot in the room and told us we had to pay $250 extra for a clean up fee. We had no idea where this was coming from so we asked what he was talking about. We were then told that the head housekeeper, as per their policy, went INTO OUR ROOM while we were out for the day and TOOK PICTURES of our stuff as proof.

Imagine my surprise upon arrival when directed to the parking garage I was told either valet park for 35.00 + taxes or 27.00 a night to park with no in & out privileges!!!! You are told by the staff that it's a 3 block walk which is not true, I walked it, the 3 blocks would be the street that the harbor is on but to get to the main mall & attractions is a little farther than that! Once you are suckered into the parking I say suckered because there is no on the street parking so you have to park at the hotel garage or the one across the street. The one across the street is $18.00 a night also with no in & out privileges& no security underground!. If you don't move your car then you have to pay for transportation which is more money!! They have these guys outside hawking cab or car rides to the harbor,(that backs up my point that the harbor is not 3 blocks away!) We took one of these cabs to a restaurant in the harbor it was $8.00!!! That's $35.00 already spent on the first night $27.00 to park and 8 for a cab ride. We walked back to the hotel and it was a nice walk back but again it wasn't 3 blocks! In this economy people do budget in for parking but I don't think no one expects to be bullied into paying 27.00 0r $18.00 a night. So to all potential guest please beware because it is truly highway robbery!! P.S. Don'y try to complain at the front desk, they will only tell you they have nothing to do with the parking.

While I understand that guests with medical reasons should be given first dibs, I booked this room MONTHS ago, and they have had time to prepare. All of the floors, except the lobby, had dreary and unwelcoming colors. They looked right out of a horror movie. It was creepy and unpleasant. The room we were given was tiny and crowded, one of the lights didn't work, and there was no fitted sheet on the bed. You heard it - no fitted sheet. I woke up in the morning laying on a bare mattress. The bathroom was also cramped, and we had no bath, just a shower. The shower's tiled floor was excruciatingly uncomfortable on my tired feet and made showering one of the most unpleasent aspects of the weekend. Now, as for the AC - it was on a motion sensor. When we left the room and returned, we were greeted with a hot muggy room, even though we left the AC on to cool things down. As well, when we were sleeping, the AC would turn off and the room quickly heated up leading to an uncomfortable evening. Furthermore, the hotel was unable to provide us with parking, so we were forced to park on the other side of town for $75 extra, and carry our luggage through Baltimore City streets from the most inconvenient location possible.

In addition, miscue 2A - housekeeping took the faulty machine but forgot to replace it, and did not restock sugar and creamer in that room.

It is also only a ten minute walk to the Inner Harbor area, which is full of shops, restaurants, and the National Aquarium. We even walked to the closest movie theater, which was a pleasant one mile walk through the Inner Harbor area. We parked at the underground parking garage across the street, which was $18 per 24 hours (trust me, a good rate in this town). The hotel is quite large: it has two tall towers. We were in the South Tower on the 22nd (of 27) floors. Our room was one of the smaller ones, but very clean, had a king size bed, LCD TV, a desk, a large cloest, and a nicely renovated bathroom with a shower only (no tub). It had a nice view of the surrounding Baltimore skyscrapers. The best part of the stay was the concierge, Yul. He was incredibly helpful. He directed us to all the sites, ones we knew we wanted to see and others that we didn't even know about. He had great suggestions for restaurants. He even looked up the closest movie theater and showing times for us. He delivered A+ service. The hotel has two restaurants: Shulas (fancy), and Shula's 2 (casual). We had a 10:30am brunch on Sunday at Shula's 2. The only thing immediately available was the breakfast buffet (it would 25 minutes if we wanted to order off the menu, we were told). There was a good selection: an omlete bar chef, bacon, good real eggs, tasty sausages, a nice fruit selection, cereal boxes, oatmeal, and french toast (not so good!). Although the food was really of fairly good quality, it was overpriced at $17 per person. It wasn't that good. All in all, a nice hotel with good clean rooms and a great staff.

I own a travel agency, so went into this fully expecting a 3-4 star hotel (nothing fancy but pleasant). The pricing was 50% less than the other hotels in the area and we knew that we would not be there much anyway. I had stayed here in the past when it was owned by another company, so it was nice to return. Check-in- Check-in was pleasant and fast! Thumbs up for this! We were given 2204 in the North Wing which was a Club room (we are also Starwood Guests). Room- The room was clean, comfortable and had Starbucks Coffee which my hubby appreciated tremendously. Bottled water was complimentary since we were in the Club lounge room. We went to the Club lounge a few times for sodas and to spread out on the sofas and enjoyed having this extra space. During the week, the lounge offers continential breakfast and appetizers at night. Staff-The staff here was super! This was the absolute best part of this hotel. We actually met the Food and Beverage Manager (Ashish) at lunch at Shula 2's and he even gave our children chocolate:) The managers are visible and do seem to truly care about your happiness. Ashish was a warm and friendly man and is an asset to this hotel. We ate here twice and both servers, Angela and Laverne were just fantastic. They were so kind to our children, were excellent servers and we really looked forward to our meals with them. The Sunday brunch was plentiful and tasty to all. Location-The location was fine, in regards to the Inner Harbor. It was probably about 6 blocks away and was certainly easy to walk. If you need a cab, they were everywhere. We did not find the area to be unsafe like others have mentioned. Fitness Room-I did not use this, but it looked in very good condition. Remember, you get what you pay for and if you want a pleasant, clean place to stay (at a great price!!!!!) you would really enjoy this hotel. The people at this hotel are truly their finest asset!

I have stayed at various hotels through those years. This year, through the convention's housing bureau, I selected the Sheration Baltimore City Center Hotel, as it was the hotel closest to the convention center at the time I booked. I know from my travels to Baltimore that this used to be an Omni hotel, and I think until recently it was a Westin Hotel. So I'm assuming that this has been a Sheraton for only a year or two. After my visit, I'm almost certain of it, as the place appears to be a work in progress. I'll start by saying that the hotel's best asset is it's staff. Every staff person that I had the opportunity to deal with was friendly, effiicient and seemed more than willing to do whatever they could to help you enjoy your stay. Two other plusses that I can mention from my trip is that the place seemed very clean, and that my room had a digital thermostat on the wall to control the temperature in my room. There was also a complimentary USA Today at my door each morning, and a printed folio of my stay's charges was slipped under my door on the moring of my check out. However, I did have a lot of small issues with the hotel and my room. I was on the seventh floor of the infamous south tower, in a handicap accesssible room on a non-smoking floor. I chose a non-smoking room, but the handicap room was a surprise. The room had a large bathroom, obviously since it was designed for wheelchair access. It included a large shower (no tub) a toilet and a basin. There was only one small towel bar, so towels, etc. were hung from the handicap bars that were placed on the walls of the bathroom. There was no shelf whatsoever for toiletries, so a box of tissues, and soap and shampoos, etc. filled the small space on the top of the toilet tank. There was no place for me to place my personal toiletries or even a glass for water. A shelf and some more towel bars were needed in the bathroom. The room came with two king side beds, so obviously was set up so that four people could share the room. However, there was a single three-drawer dresser under the TV set, and absolutely no place to sit your luggage other than on the floor or on a bed. Not even a folding luggage stand was available in the room. Trying to find out what services were available in the hotel could only be found in a stapled together set of 8.5\" x 11\" pages that were out of alphabetical order, and not the normal booklet found in most hotels. The room service menu was a similar stapled together in-house production that was in even worse shape. The only other furnishings in the room was a table/desk with a conference room stacking chair to sit on at the desk. No other chair was available in the room. There were two outlets on the tabletob, obviously so it could be used as a desk, but no desk lamp and no internet access was available in the room. I had noticed in the hotel lobby a paper sign advising that wireless access was available there, but when I got down there with my laptop I found that said access was $9.95 per day, and a credit card was needed to use it. Not very business user friendly of the hotel. I did find a network cable under the table, but it was not hooked to anything and no network outlet was found in the room. I finally settled for dialup access, but had to call the front desk the second night when I somehow got blocked from being able to make a local call. The phone on the desk was missing the cover that told you what all the buttons were for, so I had to rely on the desk by the bed to make any calls for hotel services. There was not a local phone book of any kind to be found in the room either. Calling for an elevator in the south tower usually resulted in a three minute wait (I finally timed the wait) to get a car to your floor. I only ever saw two of the three elevators in use, so I am assuming that the third one was out of service. Also out of service was the ice machine on my floor, requiring a visit to another machine either two floors up or down, usually a five minute trip ro more with the slow elevators. This ice machine was out of service for my entire stay. I can confirm that there is street noise in the room, however the only noise that awoke me when sleeping was the sirens from the fire apparatus using Baltimore Street. There was also quite a bit of noise from the doors to the other rooms on the floor, as the hinges screech and the doos slam shut. I can only hope that Sheraton is still working on this property, as it is in need of many finishing touches.

Otherwise, this property would rate an average. I was here Tuesday through Friday on the seventh floor of South Tower. The room had two double beds and was a corner room. My daughter had business to conduct and I agreed to go along and be nanny to her fourteen-month-old son. The staff was very friendly and helpful to me. They often spoke to my grandson and were especially attentive to our needs. One afternoon he was crawling around a seating area in the lobby while I talked to my daughter on the phone and in the blink of an eye he managed to squeeze himself between the sofa and the wall becoming stuck. A bellman helped me move the sofa to retrieve him and brought a stuffed animal from the gift shop to help me calm him. In the restaurant, Shulas 2, the staff offered to entertain him so i could take advantage of the breakfast buffet. When my keycard would not work one day and I explained that i was calling from the seventh floor house phone they told me they would send someone right up to assist me so i would not have to return to the lobby with the baby. They delivered the crib to our room soon after we checked in. I was very impressed with the staff and their kindness and attention. They always helped us get transportation and opened the doors and offered help with packages, stroller, etc. The room itself being a corner room was larger than I expected. The comforters were a navy stripe and the heavy curtains were a navy and red plaid. The desk chair was green and obviously a mis-match for the decor. There was a large flat screen television atop a set of drawers with attached desk. There was an additional small writing table with a drawer that opened to provide a writing surface. There was a red easy chair and ottoman. There were large windows on the outer walls of the room and I liked the view and the light. We looked at the First Mariner Arena on one side and another hotel (Residence or Rennaissance I forget) on the other. The problem was the street noise as many others have stated. We heard sirens and truck gears and other noises into the night. While I am a heavy sleeper and slept though it all my daughter and grandson had fitful nights. The internet was unavailable in our room for our entire stay. My daughter was one of thirty people in her group staying in the hotel and she said that some of her group had requested a new room due to the problem with internet and had been able to find a room with internet connectivity. My daughter went to the lobby where internet connectivity was very expensive--by minutes rather than by day. This was most exasperating for her and for me as we were both expecting to be able to work from the room. I was able to use my Blackberry for email, but could not access other information I needed. Because we had the crib and all the baby items we decided not to change rooms, but if you plan to visit there within the next few weeks and internet connectivity is important to you, check the connectivity before unpacking--you may want to change rooms. The bathroom is very small and we had a tub and a shower, but there was almost no counterspace in the room. The top of the toilet is curved and sloped and the sink was one on legs with a small rim around the bowl. The shelves above the toilet had tissue and folded towels so we had trouble with our toiletries in the cramped space. I had several meals in the restaurant, Shula's 2. All were good, and overpriced as most meals are in this setting. Twice I did have to look for the waitress to get my check, but both times the place was packed and the waitresses appeared to be working hard as opposed to just being unattentive. The hotel is within walking distance of the Inner Harbor. While the people in the hotel were very friendly I was disappointed in much of what i encountered on the streets outside the hotel. Baltimore calls itself charm city, but I did not see a lot of good manners while I was there. Few people opened the door for me and anyone who has ever tried to push a stroller knows that maneuvering doors is not always easy. I also found that the sidewalks were not all that friendly to someone handicapped by a stroller. Curbs are steep and often the sloped access for handicapped is not available or convenient--I had to travel out of my way several times in order to travel on the sidewalks and access properties. I ate in two places at the Inner Harbor and the service at the tapas place there was awful. Service and food at the M and S Grill was very good. I was really surprised at the number of times people just slammed the door in front of the stroller or practically pushed me through a door when I was trying to unstick the wheels from a threshold. The trolley rails in the streets also grab stroller wheels.....I saw what appeared to be a drug transaction on the corner of the street a block from the hotel and the smell of urine outside the Lexington Market (a few blocks West) is almost unbearable. While I never felt unsafe in the daytime I did not feel comfortable walking alone in some areas that were not too far from the hotel.

Our room and the service was fine; all 15-plus staff encounters were excellent. As others have noted, the lobby is elegant -- I'd expect that for $179 including taxes.

Most of the time I usually stay in Fairmonts, Marriotts, and Hyatts for both business and leisure travel because for one thing, I like their loyalty programs. After a while a person can begin to take certain things for granted by staying in the usual quality those three companies put forward in their properties, even though there are good things and bad things in any particular property. Stay in a hotel like this though and you'll be shocked back in to an appreciation for the better hotels in the world. The staff was nice and seemed to want to work very hard to be friendly and please the guests--and my room was very clean. However, what good does any of that do you if you can't sleep??!! My room was in what I now know is the infamous South Tower. The traffic noise from Baltimore Street below was crazy. It's a main city bus line street so starting at 5am, every 60 seconds there was a bus roaring by. It was horrible. Not even turning the clock radio to static could drown out the noise. It wouldn't get quiet on the street until 2am. That allows a guest three hours of sleep. There's a bed. You won't be sleeping in it much though. I can't warn people enough about the noise from outside. You will not sleep. This led me to think about the couple of other times I've stayed in loud hotels that prevented me from sleeping, the Hyatt Regency Miami's loud drawbridge and the Aruba Marriott's slamming doors at 7am and I must ask--what good is a hotel that you can't sleep in? As the buses roared by for three straight nights at this hotel, I once again had to ask that question but in this case, I decided to write a review about my experience to at least try to warn others of the street noise at this property. Ear plugs might help but it's such a deep noise that comes from the bus engines as they accelerate through the intersection below the tower that I don't think they would help--and then how do you hear the alarm clock in the morning if you've got to use ear plugs? The room itself was also very odd in the lighting. There were three light sources for the entire room. The bathroom light and two dim lamps on either side of the bed. No desk lamp. No overhead light by the door or closet. To look at clothing, I had to use the bathroom light. I have never stayed in such a darkly lit room. They need to buy those cheap round white lights that you can stick up and push to turn on like they advertise on TV and put one of those in each closet area. The elevators to the tower went out the morning I was checking out. I had to climb up the stairs to get to my room to finish getting my stuff and then climb down again. Other people were also forced to use the stairs. Later in the day when I was going to my car in the self-park garage, those elevators in the North Tower were out and I had to go down by stairs in to the garage. The garage was flooding due to rains and there was water streaming from overhead as well as ponding all over the place. Finally, the public areas of the hotel have a dated and tacky look to them. Think royal blue and bright white with bright red accents and you'll get the picture. I have never in all my life been so happy to get out of a hotel and come home to peace, quiet, and lights!! Downtown Baltimore is such a great place to stay and have fun in. It's full of hotel choices. Stay at another hotel other than this. Even with an ongoing renovation, without an entirely new set of buildings on the sight that have been built with soundproofing, it's beyond help and you should seek out another place where you've got a better chance of getting sleep in your bed and a better chance of seeing things in your room with lights.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, VA", "Title": "\u201cPlayed out\u201d", "Author": "AlexCallaghan", "ReviewID": "UR10316126", "Content": "I'm amazed at the accuracy of the other reviews.

You list this hotel as a 3 star hotel, with pardon our dust as the greeter, you need to rethink this rating. We went up to our rooms.

Her room was even more upsetting, someone had defecated in the toilet and did not flush. Is that a room that was ready for guest? You are trying to push these rooms off on us and giving us a free drink is going to make it all better. They send my sister up to another room while I go looking for my confirmation information so I can call Expedia. Imagine her surprise when she opened the door to room 2 and found two large men there. Thank heavens her husband was with her. The men told her that she would not be staying in that room because there was no electricity. The hall was covered with electrical lines. Thank heavens the only thing that greeted them was two electricians. They could have been seriously hurt. Back to the desk they go. At this point, I am on the hotel phone with Expedia and they are trying to book us a room in another hotel. The problem there is we already paid to park at a city lot. We are offered 2 more rooms.

We waited 40 minutes just to get menus to our table. Only reason we stayed was to see how long it would actually take. Travelocity was contacted and stated that they were sending a team down to investigate. They never notified us that the hotel was undergoing renovations. The pool was just opened that day so the water was quite cold but we were thankful it was open.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cIs that blood on the door, or...?\u201d", "Author": "SDNews", "ReviewID": "UR8277684", "Content": "NOTICE: This is an OK hotel, as long as your room is in the north tower!!! Stayed here with our biz group for a trade show in Balto, and got stuck in a badly worn room on the 19th floor of the dreaded south tower. Wallpaper in the bathroom was torn up, carpet was badly stained, there was something that resembled dried blood under the peephole on the door, as well as the back of the bathroom door (not to mention the long human hair that was painted into the back of the door). The tub & bathroom floor were dirty when I checked in, and never got any cleaner throughout my stay. I can deal with all of that, but the thing that really drove me nuts was the fact that the shower head was positioned at about neck-level (and I'm only 5-9) so I had to pull a modified Matrix move just to get my head wet. Not cool! The one good thing the room had going on was the bed. When Sheraton took over (the hotel was recently purchased by Sheraton; used to be a Wyndam), they moved their signature beds into all the rooms, so at least I slept well. The hotel staff were \"Sheraton friendly\" (if you've stayed at a few Sheratons, you know what I mean), and were helpful for the most part. I spoke with the GM for a few minutes one morning (he was down at the front door greeting people as they came through) and he was very cool. He explained that Sheraton had just recently taken over the hotel and they were working feverishly to get the rest of the hotel renovated. Needless to say, I had a few recommendations for him, so hopefully there will be a hot tub installed shortly. :>) There are 2 \"Shula's\" (as in Miami Dolphins Don Shula) reataurants on the lobby level. One is more of a casual sports bar type place, and the other is a fine-dining steakhouse. We ate at the former several times, and the food was consistently good, however the service was horrible and the prices were very high (cheeseburger & fries - $13.95). As is always my complaint with Sheraton's, they charge you 10 bucks a day for Internet access. This hotel has found even more ways to nickel & dime you, however, by charging you $10 to have a package delivered to you at the hotel. I ship boxes to hotels all over the country all the time, and this is the first time I've ever been charged for it. A bit rediculous in my opinion. And finally, a word of warning...Use caution when walking around the neighborhood outside this hotel at night. A few of our staff were coming back to the hotel around 10PM from the inner harbor, and just outside the hotel they ran across an guy who had been robbed & stabbed several times in the neck. Thankfully, all of our guys are firefighters with medic training, so they were able to help him out until the paramedics got there, but had they shown up 5 minutes sooner, it could have been them laying there bleeding. If you're going out at night, drive or take a cab!!! HELPFUL HINT: If you have a car in valet and need to leave, call down to the valet at least 15 minutes before you want to leave so they can get your car out. Otherwise, you'll be waiting a while.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cWhy are you complaining?\u201d", "Author": "FMDtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR8101717", "Content": "I'm about to write a good review, I promise I'm not some Starwood ghost writer. I stayed here in the North Tower for one night on business. Check in was easy. The lobby was clean and attractive. The room was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and modern. I had a flat screen TV, huge king bed which was comfortable. The Shula's restaurant in the lobby had excellent food and was open until 11 PM. The location was decent and is walking distance to the innerharbor. There is a Starbucks one block away. The area seemed safe enough at all hours. The best part was their limo service. Without a wait, one of the bellmen took me to BWI in one of the Sheraton coach cars for $24, $10 less than what I paid for a taxi the night before. As far as business stays go, this definitely gets a top rating from me! For business, I'll definitely stay here again. If pleasure (and I don't know why anyone would go to Baltimore for pleasure) I would probably do the Sheraton Inner-Harbor.", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tourista16", "Title": "\u201cNo problems\u201d", "Author": "Tourista16", "ReviewID": "UR8062321", "Content": "Just stayed at the Sheraton City Center for a wedding.

The internet is completely unusable if you are here for business. I ran speakeasy.net speed tests a number of times. Average download were 0.37 Mbps per second. Average upload was 0.18 Mbps. That is unusable. Room service was an equally frustrating experience. I called the number a few times and kept getting a recording. And not one that started with \"This is room service...\" It was \"Suite Services,\" which could be anything. After a few attempts I had the front desk transfer me in case I was getting the wrong place. Nope. They just apparently have one person who works room service and she was out making a delivery so she can't take the next order. About 15' after my initial call, room service called back and offered to take my order. By then I'd given up and ordered a pizza for delivery from Papa John's. Admittedly the manager did call me and offer me free wings for the inconvenience. I don't want or expect anything free. But I do expect the things I'm paying for. A further sample of how bad this place is: There's a gift basket on my desk when I check in. (Probably because I'm a frequent Hilton guest.) It says, \"here's a salty snack (pretzels) and two sweet ones (candy bars).\" There's only one candy bar in the basket. I wasn't going to eat either one but don't tell me there are two of something and only put one in the basket.

When I checked out on Sunday it was still the same old poor attitude ... no thanks for staying ... no apology that there was a power outage ... it was like \"don't let the door hit you in the axx\" I don't know if I'll ever go back to this Embassy Suites.

As a newbie to suite-style rooms, I was blown by the additional area afforded through booking a suite. It also didn't hurt that this was a very new hotel, with an excellent lounge area [think large plush couches, a grand piano, ample seating], and conveniently located next to Love Field. The room was equipped very well, with an LG TV in the bedroom area AND the living room area. With a desk in the living room part of the suite, a fridge, and a microwave, you are set for all your business and culinary needs. Particularly impressive for me was that the sofa in the living room area, which converted to a sleeper sofa. We had someone join us for one night [moving the number of people in our room from 4 to 5] and we didn't even have to ask for a rollaway bed! Of course, the crowning star of any Embassy Suites is the AMAZING breakfast spread that they offer. Omelettes? Why, yes please. Fresh watermelon and canteloupe? Of course. Chopped pecans and walnuts? Sure thing. I was particularly impressed with this ES since the spread was kept at maximum even towards the end of the breakfast period. They also offered a reception in the evening with tea/coffee and light snacks. What would have made this a perfect hotel stay would be better (i.e. ACTUAL) pillows and free internet access. It's not just ES; I've noticed other hotels switching to the \"square\" pillow format, which has to be sort of \"lengthened\" out if you want an average size albeit incredibly smushy pillow. Luckily, I'm not a pillow fiend, so it didn't detract too much from my experience but it did so for others. Also, the internet situation is awful at this place. Who *doesn't?* offer free Wi-Fi anymore? Even an America's Best Value offers free internet. If you try using the business room, good luck using the internet. Either it's still dial-up or they've decided to add some retro style and use dial-up speed internet. While access to a printer is nice, I'd like to print the page sometime within the year. That being said, the staff is extremely friendly and very helpful, both in taking care of room-related inquiries and pointing you out to restaurants, giving you directions, etc. There is a also a gift shop in the lobby (that also sells stamps!) if you're yenning to send a postcard to a friend.

We stayed here for 3 nights. I'm very picky when it comes to choosing a hotel, and I was not disappointed. It is located in a good area of town, I would feel safe taking a walk around the area of the hotel. We parked in the parking garage under the hotel which I liked, felt my vehicle was very safe. They have a security guard inside the hotel overnight. It was located closer to most things in Dallas than I thought it would be. Only 10 minutes to the Galleria or 10 minutes to downtown Dallas(depending on traffic of coure, we traveled at non peak times), only took about 20 minutes to get to Pete's in Addison. We originally got a room on the 2nd floor and we like to stay on high floors, they were happy to put us on the 6th floor. The rooms are spacious and plenty big enough for the two of us. Something important to every traveler, the rooms were very clean, bathroom was very clean as well as the bedding. I found the top off of a deoderant stick under the bed when leaving the room, but no biggie. Roomservice did a good job and provided turndown service and towels everyday. My two favorite things about this hotel, the breakfast and manager's reception. The breakfast is great, best I have ever had in a hotel. We never really needed to eat lunch because of the big breakfast. Omlelets made to order, eggs, potatoes, hotcakes, sausage, bacon, yum! Plus having the typical cereal, fruit, yougert available. The manager's reception serves free beer, wine, and mixed drinks from 5:30-7:30 every night in the Atrium. Sunday night for some reason it was served in the bar. The selection is a bit limited but you can get most drinks you want, but it's not a free full bar. They mostly serve cheper acohol, but for free I didn't complain. My girlfriend said it was one of the best margritas she every had, and thats her drink of choice, I stuck to Jim Beem and coke. We did drink at the bar one evening, and the bartender was friendly and drink prices were on par with most other places. Overall we loved our stay!! Three things that could have been better but are not deal breakers 1. The bed was confortable but could have been better, I've had those pillow top beds at hotels priced the same as this one that were extremely comfortable, if this hotel had those it would have been perfect. 2. Might be personal preference, but I like having a fan in the bathroom and non fogging mirror, didn't have either 3.

It is by far one of the best Embassy Suites we've stayed in... and we've stayed in numerous ones all over the U.S. The suite we were assigned was exactly as we requested, i.e. floor with view of city; everything was immaculately clean, the decor was beautiful throughout the hotel. What really impressed me was that ALL the staff we encountered (even those just passing in the corridor) had a smile on their face and greeted us! During the breakfast period, when the seating area started filling up, a manager immediately opened the seating in the adjacent restaurant to provide extra seating. I especially like the fact that the breakfast was served until 10:30 AM on weekends when so often it stops at 10 AM. Initially I had been concerned that since this hotel is so close to Love Field, we might be able to hear flight noise from the airport. This did not prove to be the case at all. Perhaps it is not in a flight pattern...or perhaps the hotel has good sound proofing. The physical location of the hotel is in an upscale residential and office park environment, something you also don't encounter. There are a number of good restaurants in the area as well.

Otherwise, the rooms have been recently renovated and very nice. The rooms are large with good furnishings and plasma tv in the living room. The bed is very comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful. The gym is a bit on the small side but functional. I ordered room service and the food was very good and arrived fast. If it wasnt for really bad internet technology at this hotel I would have no problem coming back but I probably wont return as based on reviews this happens allot and frankly for most of us traveling on business we need internet like we need electricity.

Also, there is a 4 mile running/walking path that goes right from the back of the hotel around a small lake that is very convenient and rather scenic, little bit shabby in parts, but still very nice to have right there. One of the very few drawbacks is that there is sometimes a pretty long wait for the elevators - there are only 2 and in the mornings especially it can be a bit frustrating waiting for one.

I have never stayed in an Embassy Suites Hotel before, but is the rest of them are anything like the Dallas/Love Field hotel, I wouldn't ever recommend any other hotel stay. From now on this hotel line is the one I will always look for and hope that they have one close to where I will be working. I think I wouldn't even mind traveling a bit between my hotel and worksite to stay at an Embassy Suites. From customer service at the front desk, the made to order complimentary breakfast every morning, the 2-hour happy hour every evening with no drink limit, the huge very clean suite with super comfortable bed, and just the overall service was extremely satisfying. I recommend this hotel line to any and everyone. Thanks Embassy Suites. You helped make my entire week in Dallas very easy to be away from home.

Only 2 elevators to serve a large hotel, and the TV's are fairly old. This is the only 4 star hotel near Love Field so there are no other options.

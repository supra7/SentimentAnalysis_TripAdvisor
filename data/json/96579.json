They had a special if you booked a condo for 7 days you received a 35% discount off the room rate. I reserved a 1 bedroom condo and the reservation went through no problem. I was happy with the room and the rate. Later that afternoon, I received a phone call from Thousand Hills stating that they did not have any 1 BR condo available for the entire week I would be in Branson. At the time the TH representative said he would upgrade me to a 2 bedroom at the same price. Later that day I received an e-mail confirmation with the price I was quoted plus the room type as 2 BR Condo. I was very happy that I would have more room, I allowed my son to invite a friend along for the trip. All was set. 4 days before heading to TH, I called to make sure that my request for being close to a pool was noted on my reservation. At that time ( 4 days before my arrival and 3 months after my reservation ) I was informed that I was back to a 1 BR condo at the original price. I at no time was notified by Thousand Hills of the down grade. I had added more people to the reservation so a 1 BR would no longer work for us. I asked to speak with a manager. I was given to a mgr ( I believe her name was CiCi ) and explained the situation. She claimed that policy was if my original reservation opened up, they downgrade anyone that had been upgraded and since they now had a large group coming in, They needed the larger condo for them. I was not happy, since I had NO communication with TH between April and July other than them trying to sell me show tickets. No where in the fine print of the reservation confirmation does it say anything about possible downgrade after and upgrade. It speaks of cancellation only. Many times while on the phone with CiCi, I was rudely reminded that I had what I originally reserved, and I explained to her that once I received my upgrade information, we invited more kids along. I was not happy with her tone, so I asked to speak with her manager. I was then given to Ginger. I Explained once again what had happened. She told me that I should have been told about the downgrade if they need the units. But since I was not, give her a few moments to see what she could find. One of the groups only needed a 1 bedroom now, she had just received their final list so I was lucky and she could give me the 2 BR. I was very happy at that point and was looking forward to checking in on Monday. I have stayed at TH before on 2 occasions with groups so I know how nice the condos can be. When I checked in I had asked to be in a certain area that is close to a pool, basketball courts and other kid activities, there is also grass that the kids could run around and throw a ball. The condo I was given, was nothing like that. It was way around in the wooded area with no grass area, very small pool (because of the heat had algae in it) and I believe the oldest buildings that TH has. When we arrived at the room there was caution tape up on cones for some cement work that was going on. When we walked into the condo, the first odor that came and hit us in the face was Smoke. I am not a smoker and have allergies as well as my kids. I knew this would not work so I picked up the phone and called the lobby. The first person I speak to is CiCi ( again with a rude tone ) telling me there is nothing else. It was only 2pm in the afternoon, you can not tell me that everyone had checked in. I asked for her supervisor and was given to Ginger again. She also told me they had nothing because they had to keep groups together and if they moved me then someone else would be unhappy! They could bring an ionizer machine over to help with the smell. Nothing I said was going to change my location. I tried to find a new hotel in the area, but since there was a softball tournament in town plus dance groups too, I was not able to locate anything within the price range I had to keep. I let them bring the machine and it sounded like a large, loud tornado fan. So we sat the first night with the machine on and tv blasting. It did not help with the smoke smell at all. I asked the next day to move but of course was told no. I went to the outlets and purchased some air fresheners to help with the smell. It did not get rid of it but it covered it a little bit. I had to double up on the allergy medicine to not be all stuffy. The \"golf\" view from our condo was completely covered in overgrown trees. The furniture and decor is very outdated compared to other units I have stayed in. The bed in the master bedroom was not attached to the head board correctly so when I rolled over or moved it made loud noises. The toilet seat was broken, The second toilet ran water all the time. Because I was staying for a week, I was to have a mid week cleaning and sheet change. That never happened. When I checked out, I mentioned the cleaning to them and they told me I should have called. I had ruined the 1st night of my trip being frustrated with the unit, I was not going to make any more phone calls and ruin the rest of my trip. We decided to leave a day early since at that point all of our allergies were terrible from the smoke smell. When I checked out, I was informed that since I was leaving a day early that I would no longer have the 35% discount it would be down to 30%. Just one more little thing to rub in my face. I should have given them the $20 receipt for the air fresheners, but at that point I already knew I would never stay there again or recommend them to friends. It was all about the money and I was only 1 guest, not a large group. To top it off, on Thursday of our week stay, we had what I would have thought were elephants move in above us. They were loud from 7 am to midnight every day. On 2 mornings at 8 am, I received phone calls that would wake us up wanting to speak to the owner! By the 2nd day I got smart and unplugged the phones. There are plenty of hotels in Branson so I suggest you look around for some better deals. I would have paid a little bit more to not have a stressful week, but it was too late once we got there.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201c5th year in a row\u201d", "Author": "CJtravelerDenver", "ReviewID": "UR115919108", "Content": "We stay here every summer while picking our kids up from summer camp.

The Majestic Lakefront condos managed by Thousand Hills\u201d", "Author": "elholtzman", "ReviewID": "UR71895283", "Content": "We stayed six nights at the new Majestic condos overlooking Tablerock Lake and had a terrific experience. We chose the Majestic because we wanted a more upscale lakefront option and, having previously stayed at the Thousand Hills Golf Resort condos, we knew we could expect something nice. (FYI - YOU CHECK IN AT THOUSAND HILLS GOLF RESORT in case you are having trouble finding the address to the Majestic.) The units were way beyond what we had hoped for from the photos and video! We had a stunning and super clean (I am very picky) four bedroom for the [older!] adults and a two bedroom in the next building for the young adults. It worked out perfectly! Both condos were spacious, had gorgeous kitchens with granite counters, stainless appliances and plenty of nice dishes, serving pieces, etc. Plenty of towels in each bath (one bath for each bedroom - nice!) Brazillian wood floors I would love to have in my home! Lots of extra pillows, too. The four bdrm on the top floor (unit 408) had a spacious balcony with lots of seating and and a screened in sun porch with beautiful apholstered furniture and a gas fireplace! Of course we turned it into a bunk room with air matresses for three girls, creating a 5th bdrm, so we didn't get to enjoy it - but we had plenty of room. The 2 bdrm (unit 112) had really nice carpet throughout and a small patio on the ground floor that looked right at bushes and the lake. Both units had a pullout queen in the living room. Thousand Hills was great about the reservations and check in, and we did have maintenance come a couple times to fix a squeaky bed, but they were very responsive and pleasant. You also have access to all the ammenities at Thousand Hills Golf Resort - golf discounts and fitness center/pools if you want to go there for a day. WHAT YOU'LL GET: a view of the lake, but there is some construction to look past if you are on the top floor. You'll look right at The Chateau on the Lake and their marina and some power lines - so it's not completely unobstructed. You can walk to the pool (very nice, but not enough lounge chairs...then again we were 19 people over the weekend so we sort of took it over!). Drive down to the dock for swimming and boating. The dock is the best part! It's brand new, really clean - not even any algea growing. We are used to Lake of the Ozarks, so we could not get over how CLEAN this lake is!!! TIP: if you plan to rent a boat during the summer - make advance reservations. My brothers wanted to wait until we got there and see which days to rent - and eveyone was booked! The State Park marina is close by, but their boats and wave runners went first. We had to drive 30 minutes away to rent a ski boat on two different days. POSITIVES: 1) great setting - brand new. Quiet - we were probably pretty loud at times with such a big group and had no complaints - and we never heard anyone else outside or through the walls. 2) on the lake (as much as you can be at Tablerock), but close enough to 76 (albeit some hilly, zig zag roads). 3) deluxe accomodations...from the leather furniture to the granite and really, really nice decor, free wireless...really top notch. 4) boat dock and pool - very clean, new and sparkly NEGATIVES... a small laundry list of less than perfect things about the Majestic: 1) no recycling bin...some of our teens were heartbroken about the number of plastic bottles and cans we threw in the dumpster...does no one in Branson recycle? 2) only about six lounge chairs at the pool...about 10 or so regular chairs. 3) they advertised grills by the pool - however these are two, tiny grills in a patch of grass at the bottom of the hill behind the pool. We made the most of it by driving down, setting up chairs and a cooler and having our own little party - just looked kind of weird basically grilling in a parking lot. The first floor units have access to grills out their patios. 4) the 4 bdrm condo had a fourth bedroom by the front door (unfortunately ours since we got last pick!) that is basically a closet with a king size sleigh bed. We can't figure out for the life of us how they got that bed in there! I hit my head every day on the small flatscreen tv mounted on the wall. There is no dresser, just a tiny nightstand, so we lived out of a suitcase for a week that was crammed in a closet that you had to climb into to use - there was about 10\" space between the bed and the closet and bathroom. Only one person at a time could pass through (impossible for my two daughters and I to get ready at the same time) and you couldn't even open the door without slamming into the bed. I came home with some nice bruises from the giant footboard you basically had to climb over to get to the closet). It was a little claustrophobic for my 6' 5\" husband and me. 5) the big condo could have used better cookware - only one medium/large pot and a 10\" aluminum pan with no handle. I didn't find a non-stick pan until our last day there! But we made some major meals (other families might have eaten out more or made sandwiches - not this crowd!) 6) the elevator was broken on Saturday, which was surely a bummer for folks moving in, but fixed by Sunday when we left. 7) maintence came twice to fix a broken bed in the upstairs/loft bedroom. We were underneath it - so it kept two couples awake everytime they rolled over or moved at all! They tried WD40 first, but it came back since it was a wood frame. We convinced maintenace to show up with screws and a drill and it was fixed for the remainder of our stay. They were very nice about it! 8) no fitness center but you can get a quite a workout walking to the dock (which will be uphill ALL the way back!)

We had key trouble one night and it was about 40 minutes round trip to fix the problem. ...that being said, I would recommend the cabins and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "arkansas", "Title": "\u201cTake a look at your condo before you go about the day\u201d", "Author": "Love-to-Travel-501", "ReviewID": "UR6843324", "Content": "We have stayed at Thousand Hills many times and loved it but this past time we checked in but then went on to silver dollar for the day and didnt return to the room until late.

The carpet was dirty, the bath tub had caulking coming off and hair stuck to the jets in the tub and it had not been used by us. When we went to pull out the sleeper sofa it was awful there was what seemed to be blood stains all over the mattress so we folded it right back up and called the front desk they did offer to try and find another condo but it was 11:30 and our 2 year old asleep we decided to make do until morning, they offered a 10% discount which I laughed at considering the price we had paid and the condition it was in. The furniture looked like something out of the cheapest hotel you could ever stay in. We checked out and I called the manager when we returned home and she was very kind and appologinic and refunded our stay 100 %.

We responded by saying that the website lists a swimming pool first on the list of ammenities; management responded that there had been a few problems about this and they had discussed changing the website but that would put them over the word allowance and would cost too much money.

We stayed in one of the brand new 2 bedroom, 2 bath cabins. Vaulted cealings, fully equipped kithens, waterfall shower with dual heads for each bedroom and the master bedroom also has a big jacuzzi tub for two. The fireplace is an automatic gasser with just a flick of a switch. The big screened in back porch is what sold me. Great place to go and not get eaten by the local skeeters. These cabins have tiled floors, washer and dryer, high speed cable internet and are just 5 minutes from the red topped 90 outlet shops and the new Tanger outlet mall. It was easy to get to wallmart and a nice grocery store, also 5 minutes away and all the best shows are also just minutes away. Now we donlt have to stay in Kimberling to get quiet and also we don't have that 20 minute drive to get to shopping and shows in Branson.

We stayed in the Legacy Building #5. Our unit included: full kitchen (full-size frig. and a microwave)with EVERYTHING you'd want in a kitchen except the food. There's a grocery store 5 minutes away (near McDonalds on HWY 76), so I had the groceries bought and away in a short time ...and made cookies. The enclosed, heated pool was in a stand alone building across the parking lot with it's own parking lot. A large jacuzzi tub in the master bath. All rooms in this unit are spacious, especially the master bedroom. Beds are Marriott beds and everyone in my group said \"GOOD BEDS!\" Washer and dryer upright unit was appreciated too! Total unit is 1500 sq. ft or better. If you know Branson, these units are about two blocks SW of the Grand Palace, walking distine if you're young and healthy ... and it's warm and dry enough. We were there on a timeshare presentation, but the units they were selling were at a different resort with noticeably smaller rooms. Note: a newer airline servicing the area has lots of $89 each-way specials: to Florida, to California, etc. (per a local). Also, these condo's have a screened-in back porch that back up to the golf course. Our unit was on the lowest level. A (second) family-size table is out on the back porch. This could be lovely on warm, breezy days, or for playing games with the family. There is a large TV in the great room area, and two medium size TVs in the bedrooms. We would suggest one minor improvement, to have a DVD player - at least in the great room. We happened to have a laptop with us that we networked to be our DVD player (to the TV jack). The TVs in the unit may have been put there by the condo owner(s) - not sure. These are timeshare units being rented-out, so you make your own bed and do your own dishes. THe owner of our unit left a book of discount coupons for Branson shows and attractions with a note that we were welcome to use it - a thoughful touch! We would stay in these units again if the price per night stays affordable. If you're bringing a family for several days, this would be a great place to feel comfortable. Relaxing is easy. It has a homey feel, and have everything that you need to prepare your own meals -if you like. P. S. - bring salt and pepper (although you have every kitchen appliance, etc. there are NO food items).", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Thousand Hills Resort and Golf Club", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d96579-Reviews-Thousand_Hills_Resort_and_Golf_Club-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$157 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">245 S.

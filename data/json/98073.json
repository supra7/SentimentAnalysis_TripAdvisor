This hotel is the hotel that time forgot! I felt like I had stepped back into the 1980's upon entering my room. It's not in the nicest part of town, but I am happy to report that nothing happened. (But I did take all of the valuables out of my car and bring them into the room before retiring for the night!) My room wasn't completely clean - the previous occupant's trash was sitting in a trashcan on the counter in the room. There were a few stains on the blanket on the bed, but it looked like bleach... which is way better than it could be! However, I did get a good night sleep. The bed was very comfortable and I had no issues whatsoever getting to bed. The shower, while dated, worked great and felt really good after a long day of driving. All in all, given the price of the hotel, I'm pleased with my stay. The lack of services would make me hesitate staying more than one night, but for a cheap place to crash while driving, this place will do the job.", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cRed Roof Inn, Exit 12 / Sycamore View (I-40)\u201d", "Author": "UgaDawg71", "ReviewID": "UR5909806", "Content": "If you want absolute budget then this is almost it. $38 gets you a simple room with a tv and not much else.

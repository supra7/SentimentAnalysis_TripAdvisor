The staff was rude and very unhelpful. The pillows were unbearable; we called to ask if there was anything they could do and they pretty much all but told my husband \"we don't really care\". The computers and printers in the business center weren't working, no one cared or offered to fix when we inquired at the desk. The ONLY nice person we met on this trip was the bartender and he gave us some great tips for eating at North End but other than that, the location was the only plus of this hotel. The worst part....it was incredibly expensive!! I'm very disappointed in Marriott and how they have allowed themselves to fall victim to the \"we don't really care about our customers' routine that so many others have done.

Traveling with little kids can sometimes be difficult, but it was easy here. The kids loved the pool (Small pool, but met the needs of the kids), loved the convenience to The New England Aquarium (Litterally next door) short walking distance to The Boston Children's Museum which is a must if you are visiting with kids, and of course The North End, Faneuil Hall / Quincy Market. The Subway is underneath the hotel and it's a short trip to Cambridge / Harvard Square. The only downside to our stay (and i'm being picky) We would have loved to have a little more water pressure in the shower, but it was not a deal breaker at all.

It is the first stop on the Old Trolley Tour (a great way to see the city if you're a first time visitor), has a metro stop at the front entrance, is conveniently located across the street from a large variety of quick food stops and restaurants, AND offers scenic views of the Wharf. It is located next door to the aquarium. The water taxi stop that goes to and from the airport is located adjacent to the side entrance of the hotel. The water taxi offers a unique and fun method of transportation that is uniquely Boston! Also, the taxi is highly reasonable and efficient. There is a Starbucks on the ground floor serving light breakfast fare and most Starbucks beverages- a great quick breakfast stop for us! The location, friendly staff, and knowledgeable hotel concierge truly make this hotel an excellent location for anyone visiting Boston, but especially those that have never been before. Our room (located down the hall, away from the lobby, and with a water/Wharf view) was clean and comfortable; however, it was not quiet. The noise from the lobby echoes, (including lobby music and typical lobby hustle/bustle sounds), can be heard while in the room. The walls are extremely thin, so much so that we could clearly make out conversations from our neighbors. The Wharf, although scenic, is also quite noisy. Every morning, throughout the day, and sometimes late at night, the loud horns from the boats coming and going are easily heard. If you're up and out early, and out late, sightseeing and enjoying all Boston has to offer, this noise might not be a problem. After all, we didn't come to Boston to sleep and lounge in the room.

This time we just had a standard room, typical Marriott, comfy beds, nicely furnished, granite countertops, single serving coffee/tea maker, mini frig, about average size for a hotel in the heart of the city. The location cannot be beat - the T is right outside, as is the harbor, the aquarium, the (very good) Legal Seafood restaurant and, of course, Quincy Market and the North End. Even the tour buses and harbor tour boats are right there. Also positive - great view of harbor from our room, a new lobby with a very welcoming bar/restaurant, with tv screens everywhere including some for your private viewing in the booths. A few negatives - no newspaper delivered to the door, USA Today and WSJ are available in lobby but no local newspapers. Would be nice to have the Boston Globe to check out local events and get a feel for the city. For the first time, our stay here was very noisy. We are silver Rewards members with standing request for quiet room, which has always been honored in the past. Our room was on the fifth floor, but it fronted on the atrium, right over the bar/lounge/restaurant. Not sure if they had a convention meeting there or just a large crowd, but it was noisy well into the night. I would definitely ask for a room away from the atrium if we return, and stay elsewhere if they couldn't guarentee it. Also, they charge for internet use, even in the lobby and the business center. They do have computers in the business center for free use, but center is not very private (no door, and it's open to the lobby). I also found that I could not navigate on their computers as I would on my laptop, there seemed to be some limitations -- and I was not trying to access any racy sites!! Just gmail, trip advisor, and some event listings. The towels were also extremely thin, not at all up to the standard that the price of the room would suggest. The room lacked a magnifying mirror, which is surprising with all the business people (incl women) who stay there. Altho the new lobby was nice, we did miss the seating near the Starbucks downstairs (the ground floor has just Starbucks, registration & lobby are up a flight). Before the renovations there was seating for Starbucks so you could have breakfast there or relax with coffee and pastry in afternoon. Now it is \"to go\" only, so you'd have to bring your coffee and treats back to the room or eat/drink on the go.

Yeah, I am referring to Marriott brands only, since that is my preferred brand. Marriott has been good to me for over six years of business travel.

Secondly, I am always impressed with the Long Wharf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Concierge Lounge, but today I was blown away by the chocolate covered strawberry chocolate cake. It is definitely the BEST cake I have had this fall. I wish my mouth had been bigger, and my clothes were not so tight already. It was simply delicious and I must compliment those who made it. Wow! Everyone at the Long Wharf \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd customer service. As critical as I can be sometimes when I rate customer service at hotels, I can tell you that everyone at this hotel is simply stellar. Plain and simple, some other Marriott hotels, like some full-service Marriotts in New York City, can stand to learn from the way they do business at the Long Wharf. It goes to show that you can indeed be a nice hotel even if you are in the mean (east) coast. Really, New York City full-service Marriotts have no excuse. Send the management to the Boston Marriott Long Wharf to learn. Kuddos to the Long Wharf because they are doing it right! Even the lady delivering little square chocolates at about 4:30 PM was delightful! Also, the housekeeping employee said hi to me with a big smile when she first saw me this morning.

A free airport shuttle bus, then two stops on the \"T\" subway train and you can get from terminal to hotel in less than 30 minutes for $1.70 with a \"Charlie\" card. But that's probably the only good deal about this hotel. By any objective standard, you pay a lot for, well, not very much. Hotel prices in Boston are just very expensive, so don't expect good value. The worst feature about the hotel is its atrium design, as noise can be a big problem. If you're sensitive to noise, beg for a room off the atrium. With a lower floor room on the atrium, some idiot (or a party) WILL wake you up in the middle of the night. Not so great if you're paying $300/night to stay here. In addition to easy airport access, you are right on the waterfront, next to the (expensive) aquarium, and very convenient and highly walkable to Boston's historic sights. Prices for everything in the area are expensive, except for the Haymarket fruit market, which sets up a couple blocks from the hotel on Fridays and Saturdays. A must see for local color and very cheap fruit/veggies.

Hadn't stayed there before. These guys just get it. Staff really make a place and everyone from the valets, to the check-in staff and concierge staff were just terrific. And it wasn't in a plastic way...just low key friendly and helpful. I have to give special mention to Jack Lyman in security and to the housekeeping member who found and turned in a favorite scarf I left in my room. Jack was an absolute pleasure to deal with and he sent fedexed out the scarf to me right away. Classy. Location is absolutely perfect, right on Boston's waterfront (unlike a lot of the other Boston hotels that have waterfront in their name), beside the Aquarium, Children's Museum, Financial district, North End (Italian), Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market etc. I've only ever stayed in the Copley area before. It's fine, but it's really suited to shoppers. This location was just better for an all round Boston experience. Clean, updated rooms with lovely bed linens. Free water in the fridge. Fruit and water all round the place (check in, gym/pool area) in fact. I'm a Marriott Platinum and was upgraded to a lovely suite on the concierge floor looking right out on the Aquarium. Ironically, this brings me the only slight negative. If you're in a room that ends with 24, 25, 28 or 29 I suspect that you will hear a lot of elevator noise. I was in a 29 room and it felt like the elevator shaft was just behind my pillow. It didn't stop me from sleeping though and I really appreciated the space and awesome view. If I was paying for the suite, I would probably have asked to switch to one further down the hall to avoid voices and mechanical noise. For you lounge afficionados. This place is a rarity in that the exec lounge (gold and plat rewards members) is open on the weekends too. Really nice continental breakfast with all kinds of toasts, pastries, boiled eggs, cold meats, fruits, cereals, juice etc and appetizers (free) and honor bar every evening. The best part...gorgeous view over-looking Boston harbor. This is a real oasis. It did tend to get quite busy with families on weekend mornings but no biggie. Some construction ongoing in lower level lobby off the street, but does not impact guests AT ALL. Check in area complete with full desk and comfy seats is one floor up on the escalator. Nice gym and pool (not huge...but all that you would need). Overall, this place had a very friendly vibe. It felt safe and secure and I would feel completely comfortable staying there on my own. There's a lot more happening around the area in summer (island ferries dock right outside) but there was still plenty to do and see in March. Parking is valet only and about $44 per day. It's expensive, but then again, so is Boston harbor real estate. You can go nearby for about $38/day but advantage of hotel is that you have 24 access to car and can come and go as you like. Internet was free for me as a plat, but I think it was $12.95 a day. Looked like there were free computers off the lobby though. Didn't use the on-site restaurant as the North End is a stone's throw away. Try Pomodoro's (booking highly advised as it only seats about 20 people). Yummy.

The hotel is undergoing a renovation, and there is no lobby to speak of. Unfortunately, they did not mention that on their website. Seems a bit deceptive to me. My room was in the rear of the hotel. The door of my room faced inward to a large open atrium. A couple of floors below was a dining area. The first night I was there, the dining area was hosting a banquet. With a large group of people, and a large open area with solid walls, and with the usual conversation level and clanging of dishes and silverware, it was quite noisy at night. Furthermore, the door to my room had a gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, which made for a lot noise at night when I was trying to get to sleep. Finally, I called the front desk about this situation, and was treated rudely and aggressively. Excuse me, but I was just trying to get some sleep, which I think is reasonable request and shouldn't cause such an unpleasant reaction on their part. Eventually I got up and rolled up a towel and put this in the crack of the door, which helped reduce the noise somewhat. The noise from the dining area was there in the morning during breakfast and again in the evening for dinner, but fortunately it wasn't as loud as it was that first night.

The only somewhat of a downside is that the hotel does not have an area for free coffee and fruit (not a necessity, just a nice perk) although there was a Starbucks on the lower floor and there is the option to make it in your room. We were not expecting a free breakfast with our stay, so to keep the cost minimal (we splurged on lunch and dinner) we just grabbed bagels at Quincy Market in the morning. Overall, it was a very nice stay, and based on the location alone, I would definately recommend it to anyone with or without children. Our stay was pleasant, our room was clean, the beds were comfortable, there was a big screen TV in the room. In and out, our needs were met. Wish the price could have been slightly lower, but we knew that going into our stay that we could get a place with a lower price and free breakfast just outside of the mainstay. . . but then you lose the ambiance of staying in the city.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cSuper Location\u201d", "Author": "DRNH", "ReviewID": "UR87990908", "Content": "Took a weekend getaway to the Marriott Long Wharf with my wife. The location was superb. The Blue Line T was right out the front door and the other T-Lines were within short walking distance. The hotel was across the street from Quincy Market/Fanieul Hall and on the edge of the North End. Also, the New England Aquarium is next door. The Boston Common, old State House, and Financial District are all within walking distance. We parked our car when we arrived and never moved it until we left because everything was an easy walk. There is a Starbucks in the hotel as well as a restaurant. There was some construction on the patio area of the hotel but I would imagine that during the summer it would be a nice place to sit and watch the recreational boat traffic. Check-in went smoothly and the room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The only downside was the door let a lot of hallway noise in. Other than that it was great. The only drawback we experienced was with the concierge. An older woman, we found her to be arrogant and condescending when asked about dining in the North End. When we checked in we explained that we were looking for a restaurant with a casual environment within walking distance. She said tersely, 'That's 95% of the restaurants here' I said, 'Great, what would you recommend' she replied sneeringly, 'Well, this *is* the busiest night of the week so good luck' and handed us some menus while she worked on something else. She was not friendly and certainly not helpful. We did find a nice restaurant but we did not contact the concierge for any of our other plans for the rest of the weekend. It was ironic that the worst service and attitude we received at the Marriott Long Wharf was from the Concierge.....go figure. I get friendlier service and attitudes at the Fairfield Inn with less pretense. Given the position, this is something that management should address. We'll go back but if we need any help we'll ask the bell desk.

Housekeeping didn't find any Ipod, and the front desk seemed too busy to really deal with our issue. It would have been nice at that point for her to suggest maybe security could go look in the drawer, which they can legally do. (Anyone with a 14 year old who no longer has his IPod would understand that to a 14 year old, it is a big deal.) I didn't get the impression that the staff at the hotel thought the same way. After dealing with the manager on duty, a couple of calls to the general manager upon our return home, and the security manager, the Marriot chain said there really isn't coverage for the Ipod. The facts are that it was in the drawer when we left the room, and after housekeeping cleaned it, it was no where to be found. What would you think? Like I said, be careful where you put your belongings. The rooms were clean (even though the toilet in the second room didn't flush properly and overflowed), the hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location to walk the Freedom Trail, is right on the subway line and the ferry line over to the Navy Yard. Parking at the hotel was $44 per night, but you can park at the Aquarium (short walk) for $35 per night. Even though there were positives about this hotel, I wouldn't stay there again because of the indifference of the front desk staff with our Ipod situation.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - Standard Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mitchyul", "ReviewID": "UR37862326", "Content": "I stayed at the Marriott Long Wharf Boston arriving on August 7 for two nights. The welcome by the valet staff was prompt and courteous. As you walk into the hotel there are two escalators one that leads you to the reception, hotel restaurant, bar area and elevators. The escalators are covered with a glass atrium with red trim. The first thing I noticed was how dirty the glass was. The area below is noisy so I guess this works as a sound barrier. Welcome at the front desk was again prompt and courteous. I booked this stay with my Marriott Rewards. I have Silver status and earn my points by planning meetings at the various Marriott brands of hotels. This is my third time using points for a stay. My room was on the 5th floor, as you get off the elevators you are in the middle of the building with two long hallways running the length of the building. My room was across the hall from the elevators and the mostly passed area of the hallway. It was very noisy and I heard everything from the hallway from my room. Elevator bells, as well as the elevators, you can hear them go up and down. People arriving at all times of the day and night you hear as they get off the elevator. It seems that when you use points you get the least favourable room available in the hotel. After three points stays it has always been the least ideal situated rooms in the hotel. The room is a standard Marriott room, they are almost all cookie cutter fashioned: Clean with the recognisable amenities, bed, desk and flat screen TV. Bathroom amenities and linens are the standard, nothing special. I noticed that the ventilation in the bathroom was poor. The desk in the room is as always too high for the chair, this is the same situation at a Marriott sister brand, Renaissance. I hate the square pillows on the bed: They are very uncomfortable for sleeping but practical for sitting up in bed to watch TV or read. I usually just call to get more regular pillows. Internet is not free and surprisingly in the lobby as well. You can but 24hrs in the room for 12.95 or 1hr in the lobby for 2.95. The hotel is very well situated and easy to access by car. Being on the wharf is nice but the hotel is next to the marina where all the sightseeing tours leave, Making it a very busy area. Walk 5 minutes and you are in the Italian district, the market district... Good dining can be found within a five minute walk. My stay did not go without an incident. There was a wedding party staying at the hotel on the second night. At 2am parties started forming in various rooms on our floor. The room next to mine was one of them. I called the front desk to report the noise from music, ice with beer bottles in the tub; you can hear the ice moving around with the bottles. Plus there were around 20 people in the room talking loud. It took two calls to the front desk; security did come and warn the party participants that they were making too much noise. The music went off but more people came with more beer and it was unbearable. On the second call the front desk manager said they were busy breaking up another party down the hall. It took at least 30 minutes for the hotel to break up the parties using the threat of being kicked out of the hotel. The hotel did take care of the situation but did not bother to apologies for the inconvenience, not even during check out the next morning. The maid woke me up the next morning at 09h30, which was the cherry on the cake that spoiled the day and drive up the eastern coast, after a short night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Should the maids check with front desk too see if the guest checked out first before knocking on check out day? I would return only if I have the points available and then some.

The bathroom is small and the large showerhead didn't have much presure but the hot water actually got hot and the hair dryer was very good. The room had a nice view of the water and a park. The concierge lounge serves a nice breakfast - no hot food like waffels or pancakes but all kinds of muffins, bagels, fruit, cereal, cold cuts, yogurt, and juices. Of course they have coffee and tea all day. In the evening they put out cheese and crakers and a couple of hot dishes like chicken fingers. At night they serve dessert- chocolate cake and cheesecake. They also have a bar that you can help yourself to and the drinks are charged to your room. It has a couple of computers and two TVs. It's a nice place to meet other travelers and the staff is excellent. The location is great for a vacation. Just ouside the front door is where the harbor cruises and whale watches leave from. The Aquarium and IMAX are steps away as are several different tours, a T stop and a Legal Sea Foods. Quincy market is across the street and the North End resturants and pastry shops are less than a half mile walk. If you take a 20 minute walk you can see a lot of histoical sites and wind up at the Boston Commons. If you want to venture a little farther, a line of cabs are always waiting outside the hotels front door. Parking. Yes it's expensive. $44 a day when we stayed. I can't justify it but...other hotels are in the 40 dollar range anyhow. When you arrive a guy greets you and takes the car and explains the process (you can get your car anytime and it can stay until 6:00 on the day you check-out) but he needs a tip. Another guy takes your bags to the front desk (another tip). Finally a bellman brings your bags to your room (a third tip). By the time you're done tipping the parking cost gets lost in the mix. And by the way, they charge $16 for two eggs and toast if you order room service, so in the relm of things the parking isn't all that bad. The hotel also has an indoor pool, hot tub and deck and very large gym. The pool isn't large and stays busy but my daughter had fun in it. It was a comfortable 86 degrees.

This hotel is in a fantastic location. It's literally beside the MBTA (Blue line) Aquarium T-stop and it sits between Christopher Columbus Park and the New England Aquarium (as well as beside the restaurant Legal Seafood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s). We stayed in room #538 with a window facing outwards from the side of the hotel adjacent to Christopher Columbus Park with a bit of the harbor in view. POSITIVES: The location, truly unbeatable. You're in walking distance to many of the main tourist attractions in Boston: The Freedom Trail, New England Aquarium, Fanueil Hall, The North End's \"little Italy\" of Boston, etc. Now throw in the fact that the T is right next door, and that adds so much more to its convenience. I'm a member of Marriott Rewards (but not even ranked at the Silver level for this year) and all of my requests for a King size bed, extra towels, extra foam pillows, a high floor, a refrigerator, and even commenting we'd like to be far from an elevator and have a room facing Christopher Columbus Park were met. This was the first time I've had all my requests fulfilled... to this extreme. The front desk staff was superb! Best I've had, very friendly and cordial. (and I've stayed a several Marriott hotels in the Boston area) When we checked in at the front desk there was a big basket out full of cookies! I'm a sucker for complimentary snacks like that and loved getting a nice white chocolate chip cookie at check-in. AND when I checked out at the front desk in the morning there was complimentary fruit so I grabbed a delicious apple as my breakfast parting gift. The bathroom was clean. The sink was actually in the bathroom, not outside of it. My favorite part was that the shower head was adjustable so that you could change the type of spray and whether it was high or low. It also took little to no time at all for the water to heat up. AND there were complimentary cotton balls and swabs in there along with the shampoo--I've never seen that at a hotel, ever. There was a very nice and large flat screen LCD TV in the room with great reception. HD channels actually appeared in HD. There was a very nice view from the room of Christopher Columbus Park and the North End, especially at night. Even though it was foggy for us, the way the fog diffused the light made it seem so peaceful, and not eerie. The architecture inside and out is pretty cool. It's designed like a boat, and one part made me feel like I was looking at the glass pyramid from the Louvre in Paris. On the main level where you check-in there's a public restroom. And considering the short walking distance from the public city one outside that you have to pay to use, it's a nice alternative to know about--Something I personally took advantage of during the weekend of our stay after we had checked out. It was well kept too. NEGATIVES: Parking at the hotel is like $44~. It's high-but hey, it is in a prime location. To avoid this, we parked in the garage at the Woodland MBTA stop along the Green Line for $6 a day (the best part was, you pull a ticket and don't have to pay til you leave. There is a limit to 7 days of parking if I recall correctly though). The in-room fridge didn't work but we wish it did. But since we only stayed one night we didn't see the use in mentioning it and just used ice... which brings me to my next point. The ice machine was about a 10ft walk across the hall our room. It was quite loud during the night when people would use it. If some sort of noise reduction could be made to the ice area that'd be nice for future guests. But in the mean time, be aware that room #538 is within the shortest walking distance of the ice machine. The hotel is designed like a ship with a lot of open space in the middle. It's great for amplifying and echoing the noises of the people who walked past our room. Thankfully the noises weren't very noticeable after 10pm. The exterior architecture of the hotel is cool... but with the way it slopes on the side, it easily affects the width of the view from inside the room. While trying to take some night photos I found myself wishing I could take a sledgehammer and knock the sloped brick sections down so I could get a better shot (see my photos) I felt a little insecure knowing that anyone could operate the elevators--regardless of having a room key. It is capable of room-key-access-only but yet it wasn't activated. This issue is slightly amplified because of the public's access to the restroom (as mentioned in the positives section). OVERALL: After leaving here and transferring to the much inferior Courtyard Cambridge, I found myself having to listen to my boyfriend complain for the rest of the weekend every time we ended up back by Long Wharf... \"We're back where we started\" and \"Remind me again why we didn't stay here for the rest of the weekend? At this point I would have paid for it!\" \"Ohh it's so much nicer.\" Point blank: We wished we could have spent our whole weekend here, and we would love to stay again! But alas, the price must be right (I don't like 100+ price hikes!)! C'mon! Let's try to be a little recession friendly, eh? The overall quality of this place is superior to a lot of places I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely better than the Courtyard Cambridge, where we ended up for the rest of the holiday weekend (read that review if you must). TIPS: A few tips to those who are considering staying here: 1) Avoid paying high hotel parking ($44~). Park at the garage at the Woodland MBTA stop along the Green Line for $6 a day, and take the T in straight up to the Aquarium stop on the Blue line. Even though there's a limit of about 7 days, the rate is cheap and the best part was, you pull a ticket and don't have to pay til you leave. 2) Relax! And enjoy having everything at your fingertips just within a T-stop or short walking distance.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven", "Title": "\u201cOur Latest Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "JCandJC", "ReviewID": "UR34653529", "Content": "We were attracted by a recent special which was run by Marriott.

The Aquarium T stop is just outside (blue line) and you can easily walk to other T lines. Fanieul Hall, Quincy Market, Old State House, North End (Paul Revere's house, Old North Church, Italian food), Copp's Hill Burial Ground, New England Aquarium are all within easy walking distance. Also, just outside there are booths for trolley tours, Duck Tours, and whale watches. There are a few restaurants just in front of the hotel, one of which is Legal Seafood. As for the hotel itself, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I'm confused about an earlier review that said it needed updating because the carpets in the hallways and our room looked new and nothing looked out of date to me. Our room was roomy and clean, with a 32\" flat screen TV, a bar fridge and a safe. Since we have kids, we spent a lot of time in the pool. It's kind of triangle shaped with a depth of 4' and 5'. There's a whirlpool with a sign that says absolutely NO children under age 16, so it's kind of nice that they keep it for the adults. That's probably because it's part of their health club. I didn't exercise but it looked like there were 2 exercise rooms with treadmills and weights. There was also a small arcade and a laundry room. In 3 days, we never heard any noise from neighboring rooms or the the hallway, which surprised me because the large open air banquet room (Palm Court) was just outside (and down a floor). Since this hotel is downtown, we heard typical downtown sounds like car horns and people talking loudly on a Saturday night outside the hotel, but this could be minimized by asking for a room on the north side which is next to a park rather than the south side. If you do decide to rent a car after touring Boston like we did, there's a National Car rental about a block away. We just picked it up about a block from the hotel, then returned it to the airport a few days later after visiting Maine.

Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market are a block and a half away, and the Boston Common is a few blocks beyond. Even business travelers will find themselves in the heart of the Financial District after a five-minute walk. Adjacent to the New England Aquarium, this hotel provides the visitor with stunning views of the Boston skyline as well as the busy harbor and airport, and some of the best eateries in the city were within a short stroll. Visitors staying at the Marriott Long Wharf will not likely need a car unless they need to travel to the suburbs. (On-site parking is $42/day.) You can catch the \"T\" from the Aquarium Subway Station next door, and rail travelers arriving at South Station will find the hotel about 1/2 mile north. Cab fare from Logan Airport is $25-30, or you can save a few bucks and enjoy the on-call, cozy water taxi ride for $10. Also, the Metro Boston Transportation Authority operates the Harbor Express catamaran year-round (except for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day) giving access to Quincy, Hull, and other areas along the waterfront. Harbor cruises and whale-watching boats leave from nearby docks. I arrived at the Marriott Long Wharf mid-week in late April, and even then the place was buzzing with tourists as well as many visitors coming to see sports events. The long, rectangular building with seven \"terraced\" floors (see photo) is constructed of deep-red brick, which yields a kind of industrial mill feel to the place from the outside. The bellmen are welcoming and helpful. Inside on the spartan ground floor, there is a small Starbucks kiosk, and two escalators take people to and from the lobby on the second floor. People tend to mindlessly gather around the top of the escalator making entry and exit awkward if not dangerous at times. I can't say the hotel lobby feels particularly luxurious or welcoming when compared to other high-end Marriott hotels. The decor is a bit of a mish-mash of old building features (like the checkerboard floor tiles) and new (like the CFL bulbs casting harsh, bright-white light into the lobby area). The small reception desk area can be very crowded at times. I didn't want to linger. I just wanted to get away from the crowd and go to my room right away. Initial check-in was smooth, and I was impressed that the smiling front desk clerk had my keys ready for my arrival. I trekked up to my assigned room on the 5th floor and found a do-not-disturb sign hanging on the knob. Assuming it was a housekeeping oversight, I opened the door to find clothes and used towels scattered across the room, so it clearly was an occupied. Annoying, but it does happen. Back downstairs again for a quick re-assignment and key exchange, and no further problems were encountered. My room was what I call typical \"Marriott-style\" with upgraded cotton linens and down/feather pillows on a comfy bed, a small computer work desk, and a small bathroom with tub and shower. The bathroom had two small double doors opening outward, which made things a bit awkward, since one would block the entrance door. A comfortable upholstered chair, ottoman, dresser, large-screen TV, small refrigerator, and safe completed the furnishings. My room had a nice view of Christopher Columbus Park on the north side of the building with partial views of the water and the North End. Wired and wireless internet is apparently available in rooms, although I wasn't traveling with a laptop to try either. (Note: Marriott's wired-for-business package runs $12.95/day.) The Oceana Restaurant just off the lobby serves seafood, and it is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I liked the modern nautical decor, and I had a couple of meals at the bar. Bar staff were universally friendly and efficient, even when busy. I can recommend fresh oysters on the half shell (six for $13) as well as the crab-crusted cod ($20), which was absolutely fantastic. I overheard other patrons raving about the lobster ravioli with a sherry cream sauce ($16). Despite the many excellent dining options near the hotel, Oceana is an outstanding choice if you should decide to stay in. The Concierge Lounge on the 7th floor is at the water-side end of the hallway with a kind of solarium feel. The large windows face the harbor, and the lounge offers a wonderful place to relax and watch the world go by. The continental breakfast selection is pretty standard. Evening snacks and desserts were better and more varied, so I suggest stopping by for a drink and hors d'oeuvres before, say, trekking to the North End for some fantastic Italian cuisine. I can suggest to anyone thinking of visiting Boston to stay at the Marriott Long Wharf just based on location alone. My only dislikes were the feng shui of the lobby and rather dark and dreary hallways. I realize it's an old building which the designers/decorators have tried to re-package as a modern hotel with historical features, but the combination doesn't quite work.

They can easily get it though becase this location cant be beat. It is right on the water's edge of Boston harbor just across from the aquarium. Most of the ferry boats and charters are docked there and the trolley tours start there as well. There is a T stop in front of the hotel and it is only 2 subway stops away from the airport on the blue line. Legal Seafood restaurant is just across the street and is a must ... the prices for an outstanding seafood dinner were actually slightly less that what I had expected to pay. The restaurant at the hotel is also pretty good. One really nice thing about staying here was how helpful and friendly the bell hops were. Everytime we left the hotel they asked if we needed directions to where we were going and then they would offer you money saving tips, reccomendations, and even some things to avoid. They were great! Also, there is a S-bucks located right in the hotel lobby.

It had a safe, mini refrigerator and the usual extras. It was not a bad size room really. The entrance into the bathroom was the weirdest we ever came across, the doors were like old style saloon doors (two and opened outwards into the room), they were certainly designed for space saving as opposed to fashion or practicality! Great location in Boston. Cons - Where do I start? I should point out that I am a big Marriott fan and have never had cause for complaint before but this just fell below standards - Arrival - The initial impression of this hotel is not good, you have to either go up and escalator or in an elevator which is hard to find, to get to reception, it's probably the least welcoming hotel we've stayed at. A sign directing you upstairs to reception should be the least they should have at the entrance. Late Check out - Day 1 we asked for a late check till 3 o'clock out on the day of our departure (2 days later) as we were flying that night, we were told we'd have to call back in the morning! That we did and we were again told we would have to call back in the morning, we couldn't see why they couldn't just block off the room, the hotel was not busy. It's the first ever time we came across this in any Boston hotel. Housekeeping - We arrived back to our room around 10 p.m. on the second night to find that our room had not been attended to. We spoke to reception and the girl called housekeeping in front of me and asked they go do it. We assumed that it would be done by the time we got to the room after we had a drink at the bar, surprise surprise the room still had not been attended to. There was no \"do not disturb\" sign in the room so it wasn't because we had put this on the door, we couldn't have even if we tried ! Late Check out (again) - We arrived back to our room on check out day to find us locked out of the room (despite us finally getting an agreement on a late check out), we called to reception twice from the house phone and we were told security would be up, they eventually arrived and let us in. In fairness they did give us some credit on our room rate for \"failed service\", which I assume is to do with housekeeping not attending the room but overall it was a very dissapointing stay at the Marriott Long Wharf and we won't be back to this hotel I'm afraid, though we will stay with Marriott again.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in America!\u201d", "Author": "cp5006", "ReviewID": "UR24828433", "Content": "Love this hotel.

The hotel is located near Faneuil Hall, the water front and the North End. I had the chance to occupy room 552 which has a beautiful view to include the park and water located behind the hotel. The maid service was nice and the rooms were kept clean. The hotel location is without a doubt in a good location, right next to the Aquarium, Boats for Whale watching tours & trolley tours, as well as other businesses. There are eateries all over the place. Transportation - (1) \"No\" wait for a taxi. They are lined up in front of the hotel. I travelled from the airport and what they don't tell you is that to exit the airport you pay a $2.++ charge & a $7.++ charge to ride the Ted Williams tunnel to get to the hotel on top of the charge that is clicking away on the meter. You haven't even included the tip yet. On the way back to the airport I used my charge card to pay for the taxi and was told I would have to pay $22 for the ride. I told the driver (Boston Cab #90) it didn't even cost me that much to get to the hotel and was advised I had to pay an extra $2 for the cab driver to process the credit card with his company to get cash back. (2) Located next to the subway/metrorail stop in case you want to catch a ride to other areas of town. Negative Items - (1) Escalator to take you to lobby was out of service, so you had to use this little elevator which can only occupy a few people depending on what your carrying. It wasn't until later in the week I located another elevator that I could have been using. (2) The hotel has a business center with 2 computers that provide access to internet, which I did not find out about until the last day. The front desk clerks do not tell you really anything about the hotel \"Unless\" you \"Ask\". (3) The hotel has a \"Marriott Vacation\" Club employee who tries to win you over with selling you a Marriott Timeshare trial vacation (you know the 90 minute review is included). Too pushy when told no, as if she did not understand the meaning of \"Not Interested\". (4) Very \"small\" closet space. (5) The bathrooms are small. The toilet sits right next to the tub. Bathroom entrance has a double door which you have to open up both sides for entry/exit. Not safe when multiple parties or children are running in/out of room, since one of the doors swings back to the hotel room entrance door path. (6) The walls are paper thin. You will hear everyone coming/going as well as the other sounds. Positive Items - (1) The rooms have a refrigerator that did not include a mini bar. This is nice if you have kids and don't need to worry about them getting into the other items. (2) The alarm clocks are equipped with a Ipod connection stand to listen to your own music. (3) Starbucks on lower level and Tia & Legal Seafood Restaurants are located in the front/back of hotel.

Flying into Logan International via Houston International. The weather was sunny and warm but not humid. Rare weather for Boston. I took the Water Taxi into the city, first from Logan a shuttle bus to the Hyatt at Logan International and a water taxi drop off at the Marriott Long Wharf Hotel. About $10.00. for this transportation. This property is on the wharf and is adjacent to the Aquarium and across the street from both Quincy Market and Faneui Hall. There were lots of tourist in the city on a weekday. This property attracts lots of families. So if you do not like children running around the property then this might not be the place for you. My room was quiet so there was no impact to me with all of the children at the property. Check-in at the Long Wharf was friendly, and quick. I requested a quiet room and received a room on the 5th floor. I did not hear any outdoor car noise or people noise. I did on occasion hear a motorcycle. My last night there was a wedding party in the open area of the 3rd floor but away from my door I did not hear anything. My room was good size, two double beds. They were comfortable. There was a desk with a chair and an armchair. Lighting was good. The flatscreen TV had many local channels as well as CNBC, MSNBC, HBO and the History Channel. The best feature of the room was a combo safe and refridgerator. the Fridge comes in handy putting in fruit, snacks and beverages. The bathroom was somewhat small but well equipped. The water pressure was good. I did not hear any of the guests on either side of the walls. The Marriott provided me with copy of the the Wall Street Journal and USA Today and the Boston Globe on both Saturday and Sunday. I used the exercise facility on the third floor. The weight room is separate from the cardio equipment. The equipment are a bit croweded and there is low ceiling. Not like the Marriott Newport Beach Spa & Hotel nor the Manhattan Beach Marriott which both feature airy and spaced out exercise facilities. The workout room was popular in the early morning with the business crowd. The cleaning crew and valets were all friendly and helpful. Almost everyone I came into contact with at the Renasisance was helpful and friendly. While this property is on the wharf it is convenient to the Faneui Hall, Quincy Market, the North End and the Financial Center. Boston is a easy city to walk through but the paving is uneven. I walked from the Long Wharf to the Park Street T station and walked from restaurants and shops on Newberry street to the Long Wharf via the Public Gardens and the Commons. My training was at the Batterymarch Conference Center located on the 2nd floor of the Hilton Hotel in the Financial district. Less than a ten minute walk from the Long Wharf property. This building at one time was the tallest in the Boston. The center is located between Broad street and Batterymarch street. Most of the workshop attendees, stayed at this Hilton and paid around $250.00 per night. Several mentioned they could hear garbage trucks and other auto traffic from their rooms as well as some thin walls. The conference center features many Northeastern University night programs. I was attending the Linkage Inc.'s Developing Leadership Development Systems workshop which was a good workshop and Linkage Inc. offers a good and reasonable priced Leadership Development & Organizational Development Certitificate Program linked with DePaul University. Kudos to my Linkage Account Rep., Monna. She's the best! Service and food were good at the Batterymarch Conference Center. I ate at Dick's Last Resort next to Faneui Hall. Good and plenty of food with \"rude servers.\" If you want \"fun\" that is the place to be. I picked up some souvenirs at the Hard Rock Cafe next to Faneui hall. I also ate at Mother Anna's on Hanover in the North End for authentic Italian food. Purchased baked goods at Bova's which is famous for their Italian bread. Bova's is located on Salem. The oldest bakery in the Northend. I also purchased some unique souvenirs at Boston Prints in the North End (near Paul Revere's house) and had interesting conversation with the owner Alice. there is QVS pharmacy located on Hanover in the North End if you need to pick up beverages, snacks and or personal supplies. I picked up some M.I.T. souvenirs at the Coop near Kendall Square which is a \"T\" stop. Spent some time sipping coffee at Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square. I ate at the higher end restaurant called Piattini's on Newberry street. Popular with the local crowd. I had a pleasant stay at Marriott Long Wharf.

We originally booked Weds. to Sat. but needed to change to Thurs. to Sun. Originally, the rate was much higher and a AAA discount didn't do anything. When I called the hotel to change to a Thursday arrival they quoted the original higher rate but, since I had the lower rates in front of me on the computer (on the Marriott website), I mentioned them and they were honored. We used the hotel's garage (at $42./night) because it was convenient but there are numerous garages within several blocks that cost less. We stayed in connecting rooms on the fifth floor, 525 and 527 and they were away from the elevators and vending machine, which was nice. On the odd side of the building, you also have a great view of the Aquarium and harbor. Rooms further down (523, 521, etc.) will be quieter and have even better views. There is one more floor above before floor 7, which is the concierge level. I would strongly advise you not stay on the third floor since that is the pool level. It's just much noisier. All the rooms face an atrium and so the hotel, in general, is not as quiet as one that would be just corridors. Still, the noise, even with conventions in the building, was not bad at all. There's a Starbucks on the first level, and a main restaurant where we had brunch on Sunday. I wouldn't recommend it. Fairly limited and average. The rooms were quite roomy and pleasant and had coffeemakers, safes, and empty refrigerators you could fit some basics in. There's a 7-11 one block away and, of course, Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market across the street. If your main goal is to do the Freedom Trail, the location is fantastic. We walked everywhere, including over the bridge to the U.S.S. Constitution, from which we took a ferry right back to Long Wharf. At Faneuil Hall, I suggest enjoying a fun dinner at Wagamama, a noodle restaurant we discovered in London. Delicious and reasonable.

It is right on the harbor and served by water taxi, Harbor Express, and most of the ferry boats serving the city as well as the very inexpensive ferry (only $1.70 + free for kids) to the Navy ship yard (U.S.S Constitution). Not only that but the hotel is immediately adjacent to the Aquarium and the Aquarium subway \"T\" station, the starting point for most of the hop-on/hop-off trolley tours and just across the street from the Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall (only 5 minutes away). We arrived to the hotel from the airport via the water taxi ($10/person) by taking the #66 Massport bus (free) to the dock where the large Harbor Express takes you directly to the Long Wharf , while we were waiting a water taxi asked where we were going and took this with out waiting for the large ferry. The taxi's drop you off on the dock not more than 100 feet from the hotel door. What an easy and relaxing way to get to the hotel. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of the long wharf and is a 7 story modern hotel which had a very nice room but the public areas of the hotel were not extravagant, but this is a hotel you used as a home base to see the city not a resort. The hotel has a small indoor pool, a nice lounge bar with bar food and a small restaurant. We visited the lounge each afternoon for some cooling refreshments. The bar food was good. We only went to the hotel restaurant (Oasis) once for breakfast which was just OK and pricey. The staff of the hotel was courteous and helpful. The hotel also had a Starbucks just inside the doors and it always had a line. The hotel is in a beautiful area, very safe, attractive and on the docks with boats anchored in the harbor. Adjacent to the hotel is the grassy Christopher Columbus park. There are numerous good restaurants all within walking distance (like just across the street) including Legal Sea Food (the best crab cakes we had), Joe's (just across the park) which had great hamburgers and French Onion Soup). Joe's was always busy and it looked like many locals ate there. Also just behind the hotel was the Chart House (steak/seafood) and attached to the building was a very [popular (and noisy) Tia's which drew a young crowd at the outdoor patio every night. This hotel as are all the downtown hotels is expensive. I searched all the web hotel services like expedia, priceline etc and I still got a slightly lower price on the Marriott web site. A Saturday stay can lower your costs. We paid $254/night for three. Afterwards I checked the prices and they were as high as $399! Way too much at that price unless for the top floor concierge rooms. Our room was a medium sized King room as none of the two double bed rooms were available. Though they brought in a pretty decent single rollaway for our third guest a child. The room could hardly take the bed and the staff had to move furniture around to get the rollaway bed in. The room was clean and attractive and had a very comfortable bed was extremely well insulated for sound and the drapes kept the room pitch black (one morning we slept-in until 10:30 because we forgot to set the alarm).

ROCHELLE from the the front desk immediately searched for bigger room for us and found the corner unit which we were told were fully booked. She apologized for the misunderstanding since our reservation shows my request for the bigger room. 2. Our third and final night, room next door left their joining door open and decided to have a LOUD LOUD sex session at 10:00 pm. We were all watching TV. My husband tried to match the volume with TV but they were louder. Thank God the session were interrupted by a phone call from their friend. After 3 calls to the front desk went without any action, I went down to ask if anything can be done about this. ANDREW placed me and my daughters in another room for no charge. This room was located right above the street level bar which were filled with at least 50 young patrons. They all left by 2:00 am. My daughters slept with pillows over their head. At least this noise was preferred to the other noise. Beside our events, we were extremely happy with the service from rest of the staff. This will not deter me from other Marriott hotel/resort since I have stayed in so many without any incidents but I will ask more questions and double check with my future hotel bookings.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tigard, OR", "Title": "\u201cWhat a perfect location!\u201d", "Author": "LoverofBoston", "ReviewID": "UR8022733", "Content": "We stayed at the Marriott Long Wharf for 7 nights.

Besides being within walking distance of the North End, Beacon Hill, Freedom Trail, Fanuail Hall, Quincy Market, Filene's Basement, it had an unbelievable view of the Harbor on their sun deck outside their pool. It was a wonderful place to relax after site seeing all day. They also have a gym, a game room with pinball machines and a laundry room. We ended up eating in the lounge of the Oceana Restaurant.

Great location. T stop literally right outside front door, Aquarium steps away, Harbor taxi also right outside front door, and Fanuiel Hall/Quincy Marketplace right across the street. The North End is a short walk away (2 - 3 blocks), which is Boston's Little Italy. Great restaurants there. Word of advice - most of those restaurants are booked solid for dinner on the weekends. Make reservations weeks in advance. Check the internet for Italian restaurants in the North End - they are all generally within one street of each other. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with any of the restaurants there. We particularly liked Florentine Cafe for casual lunch. When we were there (mid-May 2007) there was some kind of function on the first floor. The first room we were given was on the first floor and overlooked the function (some of the hotel's rooms are set up in an atrium style overlooking the floors below.) We asked for a move to another room that would be quieter and were given a room on the 6th floor, which is not set up in an atrium style. Unfortunately, the noise from the hallway is very loud, and if the room is close to the elevator, people tend to forget how voices carry in the hallways. Overall, the hotel was OK but the noise was difficult to deal with. I travel quite a bit for work and find that I am sensitive to noise in the hallway, but this particular hotel seemed louder than most. Loud late at night and loud early in the morning. Large amount of children in the hotel, assume because of proximity to Aquarium. Bring a white noise machine or ear plugs. Bottom line is the hotel is kind of dated, but seemed clean and service was good. Can't beat location. Not great for romantic get-away due to noise and kid factor.

We travel often and especially to Boston where my kids go to college so when we go the hotel of choice for us is hands down HOTEL COMMONWEALTH, an exquisite little gem of a boutique hotel which is spotless, beautifully and tastefully decorated, with the best in the bedding, best toiletries,etc............this time they were sold out for the Red Sox game so we had to look at another hotel. I figured Marriott would be fine, we have stayed at several particularly the JW Marriotts as that is their high end brand and we have always been happy with them. This hotel has a great location, near the boats, wharf, harbor,etc.........however the hotel itself is a rather ugly 80's looking outdated building. Cold feeling when you step inside and not at all a luxury kind of hotel. The hallways feel almost like a glorified holiday inn or radison. We get in the room and its very small, they have just put in new bedding which looked very cozy but the other elements in the room were very mediocre. The bathroom was dated and very average, again very small. We go out for a wonderful treat of a dinner to the Chart House, an old Boston favorite with wonderful ambiance and great food. We come back, I pull back the covers and see hair on my mattress, I ALWAYS inspect my mattress/sheets. I then notice in other random areas, like 5 other pieces of hair! GROSS!! My son proceeds to pull his sheets back and starts laughing and tells me his bed too has hair all over it! Sure enough he is right and I am so grossed out at this point, I make a frantic call to the manager, at this point there is only a front desk manager who promptly comes to the room, very apologetic and embarrassed. She then takes our things and we go to another room for \"inspection,\" shockingly this room has stained sheets! I am so grossed out at this point I seriously contemplate sleeping in my car!! So...............finally we see a third room which seems to have clean sheets. At this point I am wiped out, going through the halls in my pjs and robe like a vagabond was ridiculous! The hair is downright inexcusable, the one with the stain should never have been resused, it looked clean but with an old stain but thats disgusting! I barely slept I just felt like everything was dirty and I feared for what I didn't see! On top of all this, the concierge left something to be desired, when I checked in he assured me we were only 3 blocks from a place we had to be early the next morning only to find out we were nearly 20 minutes away! Then he gave us the wrong directions to another place we had to go to right outside of Boston and had us traveling nearly 25 minutes in the wrong direction until we finally stopped at a gas station only to find this out! The next morning we went to I believe its called Oceana, for breakfast, pretty place but just didn't give me a clean and pristine feel. I was VERY anxious to get out of that room though. Breakfast was OK, the waiter was sloppy and there were no saucers served with my coffee so there were coffee stains all over the tablecloth, the carafe was dripping, he brought me small jars of jam and one had been opened and used. YUCK! Basically I sensed a lack of quality control here, just really turned off to the hotel period. The hotel just doesn't feel polished with regard to decor and service, it does not hold a candle or come even remotely close to Commonwealth. This is NOT an upscale place at all, possibly a good convention hotel for a non discerning traveler. I did speak to a general manager and in his defense, he offered what Marriott is famous for, great customer service and followup. He promptly issued a full refund, which he said should have been done the night before and was very apologetic but genuinely thankful for my calling him. I will continue to believe in Marriott, because I have stayed in some excellent hotels but unfortunately this did not live up to their name and just disappointed in every way. This hotel needs a major refurbishing in my opinion. For what we paid, nearly 400.00 for a very small and very average room, I don't feel it was worth it even if the \"hair on the sheets\" incident didn't apply. Seems like some really like this hotel, which I find interesting...........as I said from the start I prefaced this review by admitting I am a picky and discerning traveler, but believe me anyone would have been VERY turned off by what happened to me.

I had stayed here several years ago on a business meeting and liked the location. However, this visit was over the Easter weekend so many families were staying in the hotel. As an Elite Gold member, I had requested an upgrade to the concierge floor but did not receive it, but was given key access to the lounge. Having lounge access is a great benefit at this hotel because it is open 7 days a week, unlike other Marriotts in the US. The benefit is a free breakfast and evening desserts The concierge lounge staff does a great job keeping up with the crowds that I experienced on the weekend with constant replinishing of food and cleaning of tables. One downside was that there were many unruly children who were unsupervised, particularly during the evening. Some were \"skating\" on skateshoes across the marble floor and others would poking their fingers in the lovely desserts offered in the lounge. No lounge staff attempted to address the situation. You would thing that there would be some rule about unattended children. The rooms were small but nicely furnished with comfortable beds. However, the noise factor through the walls in adjacent rooms and children running up and down the hallways was unbearable. Additionally, upon checkout I noticed I had a restaurant charge of $60 and had never eaten in the hotel restaurant. The front desk clerk, rather than removing immediately as has always been my experience in such charges, made me wait about 1 hour while she \"looked into the situation.\" This is no way to treat a Marriott loyalist. She finally confirmed it was an incorrect charge.. Overall, this is a great hotel if you have children with you as they will \"blend\" in with the others. Being close to the Aquarium is probably the draw.

The views of the harbor are terrific, and the rooms are quite plush - wonderful beds with fluffy duvets and down pillows, nicely appointed bathrooms (a bit small) with granite countertops, and very attentive service from the staff. Any request was dealt with immediately, and the staff was very warm and friendly while still being professional. The restaurant, Oceana, was terrific - we ate in the bar area for lighter fare but their dining room is lovely with windows overlooking the harbor. Room service arrived perfectly on time, and they weren't looking for an extra tip above the service charge (many hotels leave you wondering if you've done enough). A small complaint is that because the interior of the hotel is an atrium, noise can carry and sometimes young children playing in the lobby in the morning can disturb you. If you leave the heat/ac fan on in the room that tends to muffle any noise. One more great feature of the hotel is that there is a pay-per-movie system on the television that features first run movies that are yet to be released on DVD - I've never seen that before in any hotel. We really loved the hotel - it was a wonderful, comfy and cozy way to spend a weekend in New England!", "Date": "February 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cLocation can't be beat\u201d", "Author": "KurtBoston_MA", "ReviewID": "UR4394120", "Content": "Within easy walking distance to great restaurants, (Legal's, Sel de la Terre) Fanueil Hall, Aquarium, and all the best Boston has to offer. Great views of waterfront from rooms and restaurant. Found rooms clean, bright, attractive and comfortable. Front desk, housekeeping and valet all were very accommodating and friendly. Great fitness center. Small indoor pool but with great view of Boston Harbor. Lobby is a bit dated and not very welcoming. Nice Starbucks cafe on 1st level. Lounge is spacious and very busy. Only major downfall is Oceania Restaurant which had very bad service and food. We were also the only ones in the huge dining room for dinner which made it a bit depressing and slow service not understandable. Too bad as it's a beautiful room with great view of Boston Harbor. Breakfast was more crowded with better food and service. Have stayed here a few times and always seems full with families and tourists which may not appeal to some business travellers.", "Date": "January 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cToo little for too much\u201d", "Author": "PageturnerInk", "ReviewID": "UR4313061", "Content": "We were very disappointed in our two night stay at the Marriott Long Wharf. Besides the fact that the room was small (certainly for two adults and one child), both nights we had to call the front desk because of the noise in adjoining rooms which made it impossible to go to sleep.

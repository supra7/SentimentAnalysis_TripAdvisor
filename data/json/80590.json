The desk staff and housekeeping are responsive and friendly giving it a feel of a smaller boutique hotel. Located at the edge of the Gaslamp district just north of Horton Plaza, the hotel is within walking distance of the Convention Center and Petco Park, both about 15 min. Rooms are large, clean and have a large glass window allowing for plenty of natural light. Beds are large and firm, shower spews plenty of hot water. A small refrigerator, coffee maker and large screen TV are in each room. Free internet connection is included along with adequate sized desk for working. Business center is small with a couple of computer terminals and printer available. There is a small fitness center. An upscale restaurant is in the hotel although it didn't seem to be very active as there are dozens of others within walking distance. The only annoyance was an unexpected $15/night \"facilities fee\" that is added onto the bill on checkout.

I have a few minor complaints. First, the front staff didn't know that there was a mailbox directly outside the doors when I asked where I could mail some letters. Second, I like strong water pressure but the pressure in the shower was too strong. Maintenance staff adjusted the shower head but it didn't make that much of a difference. Third, the hotel website needs to be updated about the opening of the new fitness center as it currently says it will be completed in \"early 2012\". Fourth, I was upset by the lack of recycling in the hotel. There were no recycling bins in the rooms or even the business center. Fifth, I wasn't a huge fan of the decor/style (but I realize that's a personal thing). My biggest complaint, however, has to do with the daily \"facility fee\" for guests who booked a room via Hotwire or Priceline. There is no need for a $15 daily fee for water bottles (which isn't environmentally friendly), internet (many hotels offer this for free) or the turn-down service.

As it is not part of a chain, the property has its own website, but often does not appear in lists of hotels in downtown San Diego where it is located. Nor is it particularly visible from the street, where the entrance is recessed inside an arcade-like entrance, almost hidden by large urns of tropical plants. Given that the building, built in the 70s, has 19 stories of rooms, a large underground parking garage, a main-level floor of shops, and a second-floor ballroom, this is all the more unsusal. The hotel is unique in other ways as well. Modeled after an anti-room in the Palace of Versailles, the lobby and adjoining rooms are decorated in a resplendent fashion reminiscent of the great halls of Europe: giant chandeliers, antique furniture uphostered with period tapestries, chinoiserie, grand mirrors and paintings...and huge displays for fresh-cut flowers arranged in over-sized bowls, urns and vases. Even more remarkable, there is no signage whatsoever: no post-card racks, no magazines, no tourist displays--indeed, nothing that would indicate that his is a hotel in a busy urban locale. Check-in was fast, polite and professional. When I explained that I hoped for plenty of sunlight in my room, the young woman at the desk quietly up-graded me to a higher floor where she assured me there was lots of light and a view as well. Indeed, the room was lovely, once the bell-man ushered me through the small anti-chamber that disquised its entrance. He had appeared curbside when my taxi arrived from the airport, and had spirited my luggage to the row of elevators in the looby where he waited until I had received my key. After showing me around my spacious room, opening the heavy drapes to reveal the stunning view, he disappeared as unobtrusively as he a materialized--all the more astonishing given than he looked like a Thirties moviestar. The room was large, with pale striped wallpaper, brocade drapery, reproduction Louis X1V furniture, fine bedding, and no artwork other than a gilded mirror. The bathroom, which consisted of two rooms, along with a large closet, almost formed its own \"wing,\" with a long vanity and stool in front of the room-wide mirror. The WC included a sit-down shower large enough for two. The Gilchrist and Soames toiletries were in bottles twice the size of most hotel amenities, and they were replenished daily. The hotel's turn-down service is excellent--which I found surprising, given that I don't particularly appreciate the ritual. My first night there, I went to bed early, and missed it. My second night, I came home to find the lights in the room dimmed, environmental sounds playing from the radio, the heavy damask quilt and throw pillows removed from the bed and piled neatly on a stool that must have been hidden in the closet, the bed \"remade\" with down duvet and three sheets, and two discreet chocolates adorning a breakfast menu on the coverlet. The effect was peaceful and relaxing, and most appreciated after a hectic day. I have never stayed in hotel (and I have stayed in many) where I felt both valued and ignored...in just the right ways. From the moment I arrived, I felt so welcome that I considered myself priveleged; yet, simultaneoulsly, no one approached me during my stay, or interupted me when I worked in my room on the wireless internet, as I did two afternoons Housekeeping was immaculate, but invisible. On the one day when I stayed in all day to work, the head of housekeeping phoned me late in the afternoon to ask if I wanted my room cleaned, and to avail myself of the turn-down service. Somehow, she knew that I had been in my room all day, and had left me alone until she felt obliged to enquire about my wishes. My wish is to be able to stay here again. The dining-room is one of the loveliest I have seen. The food, judging by the two breakfasts I enjoyed there, was original and delicious, the service, once again, impeccable. The small bar is elegant yet intimate...which perhaps summarizes my experience of the whole hotel, where I stayed for one week. How a property of this size manages to run a complicated facility with such attention to detail amazes me...and makes it very rare in my experience of American hotels. And I paid less than I would have if I had booked a Holiday Inn. Go figure. My only quibble about my experience is entirely personal. The Saturday night that I visited the bar to listen to live music, almost everyone there was dressed in gowns and tuxedos ... attending the opera, no doubt, which is near-by, or the wedding reception that was being held on the third floor. These patrons all looked appropriately dressed for their surroundings. In my jeans and sweater, I felt so out-of-place that I left which, no doubt, was unecessary. But I wish I had brought some fancy clothes--which I will do next time I visit.

All of the above would make the Westgate a lovely hotel and a \"hope I get to stay here again\" type of place. HOWEVER......what made the Westgate not only special but superior in my mind is the fact that the staff takes the second step.

I didn't hear the phone ring and carried on with my toilette until the door knocked somewhat firmly.

The rooms were quite, large and felt very spacious, as was the washroom. Some people commented negatively on their beds, but I found them comfortable and they didn't bother me at all.

I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here. It's actually a pretty good hotel. You have to understand the decor is just.. well... tacky, and European, looks like my Grandmother's house haha. Even if they drastically updated, it would still be ugly, it is just the style. It actually seemed fairly updated to me, they had iPhone clock radios and flat screen TV's. It had everything I would expect in a 4 star hotel. It's kind of like it just irked me.. I would rather the clean, plain stylings of a normal hotel. After I won the room I called to see if I could get 2 beds, because we had 3 guests. The gentleman on the phone said Priceline rooms were only King rooms, so I was a little frustrated but he said if there are any double rooms available we could probably have one (if not we could pay $20 for a rollaway). So, at check in not only did we get 2 double beds on the 15th floor, but an amazing view of downtown! The room was clean, again it's just tacky. I kinda liked having the old fashioned \"electronic key\" that looked like a key! The room was very large so was the bathroom and vanity. My only major complaint with this hotel was the fees. I honestly felt nickel-and-dimed. I paid $32 to park, then a $15 resort fee when I didn't utilize any \"resort\" services (and there was no water bottles in our room till they came and turned down our beds), we barely used the internet (and would have done without it had it not been \"free\"), didn't use the gym or anything. Then I thought I might have to pay for the rollaway on top of everything. The fees ended up being more than 1/2 what I actually paid for the room. I guess that is what you get in Downtown. But it was frustrating since we were on a budget. Overall a good stay. The staff was friendly.

I attended a two-day class at the hotel... the elevator commute was fantastic!! I booked an early flight from Denver to San Diego with the intention of spending the day in LA. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am and I requested an early check-in. The woman at the front desk was most accommodating and checked us in right away. I'm an Expedia Elite Plus member and this was already noted in my hotel record; so, we received a room upgrade to the 11th floor (Rm #1188). The room is situated along 3rd Avenue facing The U.S. Grant Hotel; an OK city view with one king bed. I don't find San Diego to have a spectacular city view, so a bay view room may be better (it was not available). The room was quiet at night, not much street noise; basically because we were on a higher floor. The light beaming through the sides and bottom of the door to the room wasn't too distracting. It served as a night light of sorts to help navigate my way to the bathroom. (^_^) Maid service was good, as it should be... our class broke for lunch at 11:15 and when I returned to our room on both days, the room and bathroom were spotless. The only thing that was a bit disconcerting (as mentioned by a previous reviewer), is that the maid will knock, then immediately start to open the door. This happened during the day and again at night. One night, around 9:30 PM , the maid knocked on the door to inquire if we liked our turn-down service. Uh, yes... thank you... good night!! The other thing that didn't make sense was having the Afternoon Tea right in the middle of the main entrance lobby of the hotel... As I was heading to the Business Center from the elevator, I had to negotiate tables which was a bit distracting to the diners to say the least. And I had to move through the tables again to leave the Business Center and exit through the front door. Not a well thought-out plan for the flow of traffic for both dining guests or hotel guests. Although I was prepared for the $32/night valet parking and the $15/day resort fees; the parking fee is still pretty exorbitant. I know the GM will say that is standard for San Diego; however, I would expect the valets then to be present 24 hours a day. On Thursday night after returning from dinner, a valet was not outside, so my husband actually parked the car himself (which surprised the valets in the lower level [LL] of the hotel when he pulled in)!! After that, we just parked the car in the LL ourselves. I liked the convenience of printing our boarding passes from the Business Center. The copies go to a printer at the Front Desk, then are delivered to your room. Instead of waiting, I went right to the Front Desk to pick the copies up myself. The hotel is right across from Horton Plaza (the mall hasn't changed much since 1999) and within walking distance of several restaurants in the Gaslamp District. Dinner suggestions: Gladstone's (PCH1 and Sunset Blvd), Vigilucci's La Jolla, and Cafe Sevilla in the Gas Lamp District. Although we enjoyed The Westgate, when visiting San Diego again, we'll stay elsewhere.

Traveled with 2 young kids. Priceline booking-great rate ($90) just before Comic-Con. Amazing location. Be ready for extra $15++ for 'facilities fee' and don't complain - be prepared for it. But, for a large city, downtown hotel, wired & wireless plus water plus newspaper - the amount is not bad when you are paying a low room rate - many hotels charge this for just Internet. Also, if you have a car, expect to pay $30+ per night. However, many ways around it with minimal hassle. I used street parking the entire visit and spent less than $15 for a five day visit (incl weekend). The decor is truly Europe. Very tastefully done, would not decorate my home that way, but very nice. Rooms were very large, great bathroom with good shower/sink pressure, counter space, closet space, drawer space. Booked on Priceline since Comic-Con made room availability very sparse (and expensive). Got a great rate. After booking, I called hotel directly and placed a request for high floor and double beds, and informed we'd be arriving early and requested an early check-in.Front desk did not promise anything, but included the details as a request and mentioned nothing about extra fees. We checked in on a Friday. Arrived at 11:00am. Was promptly informed the room was not available and a double bed was not a high probability. Stated the contracted room via Priceline is a King Bed only. We traveled to San Diego mainly for the kids. We were busy almost the entire day leaving early and returning after dinner time. So, \"staying\" in the room was not our plan. We knew there was no pool (big negative), but we would not have had time to use it if there had been one. So, keep this in mind for this entire review. We jetted off with good recommendations from the lovely Indian concierge woman (already forgot her name - sorry). We returned to the hotel after 4 PM and the room was ready. The Front Desk CAME THROUGH BIG TIME!! Gave us a room on the 16th floor - not facing much of a view, but no problem. Gave us a room with 2 double beds. Made it a point to inform we with a Priceline booking, the hotel was not obliged to give this type of room without any extra fees. We did not argue and we did not 'fight' for this when we checked in. We were calm and accommodating, and I think this helped tremendously. I parked on the street with a coin operated meter for 2-hr parking. Once Fri at 6 PM hit, parking was free until 8 am. Returned at 8 AM to add coins until we were ready to leave for the day's activities. Street parking is all around (best is off 3rd near A, or B, or Ash streets). Pay no attention to the many homeless who line the streets starting around 7 or 8PM. They were not aggressive in any way, nor loud, nor beggars. The car was parked in street parking the entire stay and never had any problem with damage of any kind. Be sure to read all meter signs for times and days and restrictions. Have lots of quarters ready or visit the 7-Eleven or Front desk to get your change. Yes - an added 'hassle', but to avoid any downtown hotel $30+/day parking, it was well worth the effort. Parking was never more than a 2 to 4 short blocks walk from the hotel (often with less time than the valet to bring it out front). Once Saturday at 6 PM hits, no parking meter fees required until Monday at 8 AM. Add change in the AM and take off for the day, return after 6pm and no fees again. Negatives... * No pool * No real \"action\" inside the hotel (restaurant) * Concierge not 'full-time', sometimes would have to wait for front desk staff Positives... * Great Priceline rate * Great Granny Smith apples all day long * Great cookies in the evening (Choco-chip/ Macadamia Nut) * Great location (downtown/ Gaslamp) * Great housekeeping response * Turndown service dark chocolates :<) Must note** - anything we asked for, they delivered (extra towels, shampoo, water) and quickly and with a smile and with courtesy. Loved the proximity to almost everything (freeway close, Gaslamp Quarter restaurants/ bars galore, central to everything. San Diego is spread out, so no matter what/ where you do, you need to drive some distance - might as well be central. Close to airport. Rent your car from Enterprise (off airport location at W Palm St), use the airport Alamo Rent-a-Car shuttle and walk literally across the street to Enterprise - don't tell them how you got there. Then, use the \"We'll Pick you up service\" for the return ride to the airport. All in all, with many similar circumstances, would stay at Westgate again and recommend it. My wife - who was a huge pessimist before even getting to the hotel - was extremely pleased and wished we had been able to stay here for the entire duration (had Comic-Con not messed things up for us) - poor planning on our part.

I guess they use these names so you feel better about spending $32.00/day for parking. The place is old, but well maintained. The gym is small. The lobby is interesting. They had tea time and I actually saw a bunch of women sitting around having tea and crumpets, in the lobby, wearing large hats, Pretty cool, but I bet it cost them a fortune.

Large double entry ornate doors to the room with gold door knobs and trim. Marble floor to ceiling in the shower/bath. Thick lovely vanity tops in the baths, designer gold bathroom fixtures, unique quality light fixtures and lamps, top of the line brand name bath products and plush comfy bath robes, expensive top of the line carpeting, high end custom cabinetry and furniture, and moldings everywhere. Full floor to ceiling and wall to wall windows and sliding glass doors that leads out to your room's balcony. The lobby entry is spectacular, there are antiques, art, amazing chandeliers, a staircase you will want to pose on. There is a gorgeous huge piano and a harpist was playing as we entered. Marie, at the front desk was just superior and helped us fully enjoy our stay. The elevators are beautiful, more marble & gold there too. Yes, they charge a daily facilities fee of $15, but that includes things like, two free chilled bottled waters, free internet, free newspaper, 24 hour fitness center, 24 hour business center, in room coffee/tea/hot choc, mini-fridge & safe. Another poor review stated they charge you a fee if you loose a room key...this is false info, they don't charge anything for a lost room key! They do charge for parking separately, but so does every hotel in the entire area! It is not a surprise charge, if you don't have a car you pay nothing extra, if you have a car you pay to park. This is why it can't be included as a charge on hot-wire or others, not everyone needs parking. We did not get a chance to eat at the hotels restaurant, so can't comment on that. The Westgate Hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from all the restaurants & shopping. It is also right next door to the US Grant. We tried the, Rei do Gado, (a brazillian all you can eat, but really gourmet!), it was awesome and the Yard House, next door to the Rei do Gado, with 100's of kinds of tap beer and great food too. We slept with the sliding door open and loved the coastal air. I suggest using the two sets of ear plugs in your night-stand if the noise of the bustling city bothers you when the doors are open. When we stayed, the hotel was completely sold out the night before, (probably due to the great prices on hot-wire), so don't be surprised if you can't check-in until 3.

Personally I think that they take advantage of the client charging such a high parking rate as well as the facilitie fee. Once you are checking in you do not have the option of declining these services so we are stuck paying an additional 94.00 for our stay after we already payed the travel agency for our room and taxes. The facilitie fee is supposed to cover the waters in your room,wi-fi, and something else I guess. We did not drink their nestle bottled waters or use the wi-fi so as far as im concerned it was an unnecesary charge. Why not charge if the services are used just like everyone else or raise the rates even more and keep it included.

Cabs would have been just $5-$10 to most places. Bus to Zoo was very convenient, just a short minute walk across the main street. Beware there are homeless people just about every block but we didn't find them bothersome. We got a room on the 14th floor. The entrance to the rooms are quite odd to me. Two rooms share a main French door entrance. Once you open that with the key, you come into a small foyer, then access your room on the left or the right once again using your key. The advantage is that hall noise is reduced but then if your \"neighbor\" slams his/her door, you hear that too. The room size was very generous. The bed was a bit firmer than typical hotel beds but that was to my liking. The pillows are way too soft. I had to double up on them. There were two comfy sofa chairs which we sat in to read the paper. There was another wooden padded chair in the room which we didn't use. The bench at the foot of the bed was nice for putting on / rempoving shoes. The bathroom was also huge. One sink, large vanity with chair for the lady, plus even more counterspace. There is a separate room for the toilet and the shower/tub. It is a square shaped shower/tub with swinging glass door. The built-in seat was nice to sit down to shave. The toiletries were also of high quality. The lotion was one of the most moisturizing I've experienced of hotel lotions.

They apologized and said they would take that off the bill leaving us with a zero balance (we pre-paid on Expedia).

However, almost everything about it is old. Not old in a bad or decrepit way, just - nostalgic. Having traveled extensively for several decades, I would describe the Westgate as an almost perfect replica of five star travel circa 1985. Right down to the old-school push button phones, tube televisions, safes that work with a magnetic stripe card (check out our latest technology!) and heavy gold bathroom hardware. Again, the amenities aren't bad, just ancient. It was like sleeping in a museum of hotel history.\u00c2\u00a0 Otherwise, the Westgate is a fine if unremarkable hotel for business travel.

Having the wifi was fine but why the heck do you need to workout in San Diego on vacation is beyond me. Anyway, our room was nice and the service was okay. We kept on getting walked in on by the staff as they were confused about the \"do not disturb\" sign. Everything else was fine. My overall impression is that if you plan on using Priceline don't expect too much savings when your staying in downtown San Diego because parking is always going to be expensive. I would say that for the amount ofoney you end up paying, you're better off with a three star hotel or even perhaps staying in La Jolla.

But this is not as bad as the next thing. I find it comical how I was charged almost $10 for a two minute phone call made from my room to my husband's cell phone. When we first checked in the concierge had stated that we could make out-of-state phone calls for free, then next thing we find out I was charged $10 for a 2 minute phone call. Utterly ridiculous! I told front desk that this is misleading and they should put a disclaimer by the phone saying that customers will be charged 300% more if they decide to use the hotel phone. Very misleading!

She may be older than some hotels, but that means rooms are larger (ours was huge by most hotel standards). We had a desk, 2 club chairs, foot stool, armoire with TV, DVD play, safe, and mini fridge. along with assorted side tables and a foot bench. The bathroom consisted of 2 rooms, a dressing room with dressing table, single sink, cabinet with drawers. There was also a WC with a large walk in shower and toilet. The clock radio has an ipod /iphone charging dock. There is no-brainer-to-connect WI-FI (yes, for $15/day as noted by others). The room entrance is a bit odd. Two rooms are accessed from the hallway. You open the hallway door and enter a small hall. We were in room 694. Rooms 694 and 695 enter from then main hallway into this short entry room. From there, you enter your room. It is very private, but initially confusing. This would be a great feature for traveling groups or families. For just my husband and myself, it was unusual. The hotel also uses a magnetic key (yes, an actual key) system (no numbers on the keys) These keys are easily reprogrammed, but I prefer the credit card type of key. I am afraid that if I lost this key it will cost me $120.00 to replace as that is what a locksmith would charge for a replacement key. Arriving at the hotel was disappointing. A group had booked the lobby (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, the lobby) for a fashion show. We were told to enter through the side entrance. That was insulting.

We booked this hotel through Priceline for a spectacularly low price relative to what Expedia was asking (approx. 1/3). When we got there, we were quickly checked in and experienced nothing but positive and friendly service. The hotel lobby is old world, gilded and worthy of a movie set. My fiance and I took engagement photos in the lobby and the second floor ballrooms and hallways. I would not be exaggerating by stating that the hallways on the second floor look palatial, with china cabinets and porcelain statues and vases on pedestals. Our rooms were very well appointed, although the carpets are a bit dated. Nonetheless, everything was very clean and daily maid service was perfect. Messages were left for us when we had our \"privacy\" sign out, turn down service included filling the ice bucket, it couldn't have been more perfect. We heard the next door neighbors literally and figuratively \"banging\" but otherwise very well insulated from room and street noise. There is a small, but well-appointed gym, but no pool. The location is excellent. Less than 2 miles from the airport and right next to the Horton mall one block away. 7-eleven next door as well for snacks and drinks. One issue though, San Diego downtown is a bit sketchy - there are a lot of homeless and bail bonds places right around the corner from 4-5 star hotels like this and the US Grant. We asked the concierge if walking to Little Italy was possible (at 10 pm) and she cheerfully said yes. After 3 blocks, we had to turn back and get the car. The streets became rough and dark with underpasses and highway crossings. I wouldn't do it and she shouldn't have given us the advice. Now for the bad part - and this is big. Parking now costs $32 per day! And there is no street parking at all in the area (for over 30 minutes). Much of San Diego downtown is like this so you have no choice but to pay. Next, there is now a Mandatory, HIDDEN $15 room fee! This is over and above your Priceline total. So if you think all you're paying is the Priceline total, you are WRONG! Add $15 to it. The attendant told us that this was a new policy and that it covered wireless internet, 2 bottles of water a day, and a newspaper. We could not opt out of it. This is flat out wrong. People use priceline in order to pre-pay and get a total and fixed cost. What's to stop a hotel from charging $50 extra per night when you show up??? Even if you book this hotel directly from their website, you may miss this extra $15 charge. Al in all, I tolerated the extra fee and parking charges because the hotel was exquisitely elegant.

Now, the BAD!!! -Over-priced parking (about $30 nightly) -No coffee-maker in room (free coffee is in lounge) -Mini-safe has to be purchased to be used. -2nd night of my 3-night stay was completely sleepless and scary, as a group of completely drunk \"soccer riot\" types blasted into their rooms next to us screaming at 11 pm, then left. They then returned in the midst of a FORTY MINUTE free-for-all physical fight at 3 a.m. People being thrown against walls, language that would make Bobby Knight blush and apologize,...you get the idea!! I was actually too scared to call for help, as I thought they'd figure out it was me that called and be waiting to beat me up in the hallway, NO JOKE!!! THE CAVALRY!!! -The Westgate earned my complete and total respect the next morning. After apologizing profusely, they assured me that something would be done to rectify the situation for my daughter and me. Later that afternoon, they bumped us to a top floor, SPECTACULAR suite!! Gorgeous harbor views, etc. Further, they gave us 2 free unlimited room service breakfasts (priced at about $25 EACH), moved our luggage for us,....and fined the losers in the room next to us $250 for the disturbance and damage done to the room by smoking in it!! (haha idiots!!). I probably received 7 or 8 very sincere apologies, when only 1 or 2 were necessary.

I didn't expect my room to be ready but went to the hotel anyway (can't walk around town with luggage). Met by a bell hop who took my luggage to the front desk. They checked and discovered not to my surprise that they didn't have mt room available, the very pleasant woman on the front desk suggest I leave my luggage, and call back around lunch time and they should be able to get me in. I left my luggage and walked back downtown looking for something to do, I decided to take a hop on, hop off style city tour, purchased tickets for that, as well as the zoo and Midway.

From the exterior the hotel is like any other, but once you walk in, you are transported to another time and place, it is one of the most beautiful lobbies I have encountered in a long time. There are ample elevators resulting in Little waiting to get to or from your room. My room was on the 5th floor, it was very nice. Once off the elevator, you are greeted by a set of double doors that lead to two rooms, one of which was mine. An electronic key grants access to the hallway and your room. My room was very large, a french balcony offered a somewhat limited view of downtown. The room was well equipped with TV (older tube type, not a flat screen) DVD player, clock radio with ipod dock, desk, chair and bed. It also had at least 3 phones, one next to the bed on a night table, a second on the desk and a third next to the sink. The hotel offer free wifi access as well. Off the main bedroom was a large bathroom area containing a lengthy vanity, and sink along with nice bath products, creams, shampoos and soap. Off of that room was a walk in closet, with double doors, and a sliding door led to an inner bathroom with toilet facilities and a large shower/bath combination. The room was very clean, but slightly dated by worn carpet. The room was cleaned in the morning, and in the evening there was a turn-down service, where the comfort and extra pillows were stored, chocolate left on the pillow, and a personalized forecast was left on the night stand, free bottle water and ice was also supplied at this time. The hotel made me feel special, I had planned to attend high tea, but didn't feel that my attire suited the occasion, young women were there in the bright colourful dresses and flowery hats. The hotel is very classy. As I had already mentioned the carpet was worn, the only other downside was street noise. San Diego has a busy railway downtown and the noise can be disturbing. As in many big cities, sirens can be heard much of the night, a fire station is just a little over a block away. Also there was a protest one morning across the street that woke me.

Great area with plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Our only problem came the next morning. We decided to have breakfast downstairs in the dining room. The menu looked very inviting. We stood at the door of the restaurant for about 5 minutes. No one greeted us. We became a little confused and wondered if we were supposed to seat ourselves. There were only about 5 tables taken by mostly businessmen. Finally, a hostess (I think) came by and wanted to sit us in a dark corner. We pointed to another table for two (not far away) and asked if we could sit there. She hemmed and hawed and muttered that it would take a long time to get another place setting there, but let us sit there anyway. Within minutes, an enterprising waiter scooped a place setting from one of the many empty tables...voila! Crisis averted! And so we sat, and sat, and waited and waited. Ten long minutes later, the hostess came by and asked if we would like coffee. YES! PLEASE! More waiting, waiting..waited for coffee..waited to have our order taken...someone else came in after us and had all their needs taken care of a lot more promptly. We finally decided we had to leave. Things to do & see. When the waiter finally came to take our order, we asked him to just bring us the check for our coffee because we had to leave. He said he was sorry, and disappeared. The (I'm assuming) manager came to our table. His words to us were \"You wanted to sit at this table, we let you sit here. What is your problem?\" Holy cow. He was argumentative and rude. We tried to explain that we had been waiting for a long time, and another table who came in after us had already been served. Again, he argued with us. At that point, we just got up and left.

The hotel's location is superb, right at the corner of the Gaslamp area and right across the street from the very nice outdoor Horton Center shopping center. There are probably 100+ restaurants within a few blocks, many of which have amazing happy hour deals on both drinks and appetizers (we tried several). The hotel is elegantly decorated, maybe a bit over the top like pseudo-European Versailles, but it worked. Staff are ultra-professional, uniformed, and friendly. We felt pampered. The hotel itself is really quiet and there's not much hustle and bustle. The only downside is that it's on Broadway, and even 14 floors up, the hooting and hollering and sirens until nearly dawn on Sunday morning might bother very light sleepers (maybe ask for a room on the other side, but you'll miss an amazing view of downtown and the bay). Rooms are very large, very nicely decorated, and with really large and elegant bathrooms (marble tile, big vanity with cushioned stool, oversized tub, big towels, bathrobes, etc.) Previous comments mention shower temperature and pressure, but both were amazing. The bed was really nice, although a notch below the heavily marketed fancy beds of some of the hotel chains. Our room looked exactly like the picture on the website. Loved the balcony! Big plus: the hotel has free wireless Internet and the speed was excellent. Bravo! The fitness center was very well equipped, but despite the marketing, there really isn't a spa, just a treatment room apparently available only if you book a treatment ahead of time. There's no pool. The dining room and bar seemed dead all the time (not a single guest in the dining room early Saturday evening), but afternoon tea looked like a lot of fun and it was pretty booked up. The concierge was very helpful, but not there all the time. You just get the feeling that not much happens at the hotel, which is a shame because it has so much going for it. On the other hand, you can get a good deal and enjoy a quiet and relaxing visit. This was a great stay.

Decorated in a classy 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French provincial motif, it is a great reminder the old style, elegance and excesses of the wealthy from a segment of society that is seldom seen. Upon entering, patrons are sucked into a massive and yet sparsely furnished lobby area. Suspended from 20+ foot ceiling are at least 6 large chandeliers (the size of a small car) and each is ornately trimmed; all seemingly to leave you wondering what would happen if they were to fall. Overall, the lobby is very impressive, but is more designed to show off the large collection antiques and therefore had more the appearance of a museum. The lack of coziness made it difficult to carry on a conversation with anyone in the lobby. This was because the furniture was so spread out and if there was any activity in the background, the noises echoed and added to the problem. However, a real good hearing aid or maybe a bullhorn could easily solve this problem. There is a nice internet room with two computers a fireplace and a few sofas.

There is no denying that it is a beautiful hotel and I encountered a very friendly staff. While most of my activities were located in another part of downtown and the hotel's location was not totally convenient for me, fortunately, I do love to walk and built walking time into my day. My first complaint is the ice situation. Unlike most hotels, if ice is needed, a call to room service is necessary. I was promised ice in 15 minutes. 30 minutes later, it did not show up. Another call was placed and it was promptly delivered. Ice is not free either as I believe it is customary to tip room service delivery. Remember to build time into your day for ice. My main complaint is the room design. I was looking forward to a weekend of rest but two nights out of three were interrupted from noise from the room I shared an entry with. While the entry ways adequately block noise from the hallways, you are at the mercy of your neighbors as far as noise is concerned. During the first night, I was awakened by the sound of my neighbors checking out of their room at 3:30 a.m. Luggage banging and conversation made it sound like they were ready to enter my room. It really is like sharing an apartment with someone and having adjoining bedrooms. The next morning I was moved to a larger room with two beds. The room next to me was already occupied and I could hear a toddler cry. I should have asked for another room but I was willing to try my luck and did not want to appear to be a crank. Out of exhaustion, I slept well the next night but the third night was another story as I was awakened at 3:30 by the shrieking, crying toddler.

The entire hotel had a distinctive european feel, our room was nice and large and the location put us close to the gaslamp for restaurants and to the Horton plaza which is a nice outdoor mall area.

The service I experienced was first class, everyone was not only friendly and helpful, but professional and classy. I enjoyed being treated like I truly was important. Some people might complain about the parking, it is $28 a day for valet parking, which is the only option. But most other hotels I looked at charged at least $20, and it was nice to pay a little extra and once again feel like a big shot with the valet taking my car for me, then delivering my bags to the room, great experience. The room was large and nice. It is a little weird how you enter in through a double door into a small entry way you share with another room, then you enter your room. But this little oddity does give more privacy and it helps keep the sound level from the elevators and hallway to a minimum. We had a King bed, which was comfortable and the room had two arm chairs and a desk. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed with a large shower. The room seems a little empty though because it is large and the old TV cabinet with old tube TV are a little funny to see, but this is not the type of hotel I would expect to see fancy high tech items in. Everything I needed was there including all necessary soaps and shampoos as well as a hair dryer and curling iron. The room also had a large double sliding door that opened to a small balcony, a nice touch. Finally, the room was very quite, and while the bed was not as comfortable as my memory foam bed at home, it was decent if a little firm. The location is good, a short two block walk to the start of the Gaslamp district, the walk seems a little sketchy at night, but in all reality I never felt unsafe. Also, once you get to the Gaslamp district their a plenty of bike taxi's that could take you back to the hotel, an especially good idea of you are having difficulty walking from all the delicious food and drink available in the Gaslamp district. Another note, the Yard House is one block away from the hotel and it has excellent happy hour offerings and a gargantuan selection of beer on tap. Finally, while I did not use the train service it should be noted that the train runs right past the back side of the hotel, so I am assuming that there is easy access to this transportation method as well. Amenities, I did not see any that interested me and I did not use any of the hotel services, although I noticed they did have a fitness center, small restaurant and most interestingly an old fashioned barber shop complete with red and white striped pole. But in all reality with the Gaslamp district so close and some many unique and wonderful restaurants to chose from why would I over pay for something at the hotel. In the end the quality of this stay comes down to the great price I received from hotwire. I paid $79 for this hotel, which after taxes paying for valet and tipping my one evening stay in the middle of the week cost $130. In my opinion this was a great price to experience a new hotel that had a unique atmosphere. Everything was clean and service was good, I do not think I could get anything better for the price. However, the rack rate of $180 per evening plus tax, tip and parking would have left me ticked off. I would say for a unique getaway and a place close to the Gaslamp this is a good choice, but I would not pay much more than $80-$90 a night plus taxes etc. I hope that helps your decision making.

The review options here seem more like that for a restaurant but i am reviewing this as the hotel. The hotel is definitely older and more refined. Elegant and very tastefully decorated. The place was immaculately clean and polished. The staff at the valet were all polite and courteous and efficient. The staff at the front desk very professional. Alexandra checked me in and she was quite quick and efficient. I had asked for a higher floored room than was reserved and she was able to accommodate me with out fuss. The room we were in faced west and from the balcony you could see the bay. At dusk, it was breath taking. The room was spacious and as tastefully decorated as the lobby. There was a sitting chair, a desk with hard wired internet and an armoire with a television and DVD. The bed was large and firm and the pillows fluffy. The clock radio was made for an IPOD. The bathroom was large and clean and the shampoos and soaps were a good quality. Towels were big and fluffy. The floor didn't have an ice-maker and the valet had offered to bring some up for us. The elevators were fast. The bar on the lobby floor was quite small but large enough for a two piece band (that we didn't take the time to listen too). The only drawback to the room was the noise . . . although old and i would assume the walls were thick, there was very little sound proofing when the door was closed (you could see light from the hallway adjoining two rooms). We happened to be in a room where the next door neighbors were partying until 4am and we heard them until they decided to go to bed.

I travel to San Diego 6-8 times a year, and I always stay downtown. I have about 4 or 5 usual haunts that I typically choose from, but this last trip, EVERYTHING was booked. I finally called this place and they had a room. I took it, only knowing that it was on 2nd street (I'd seen the sign from Broadway). After looking at the website I was a little bummed, thinking I was going to hate it. I like hotels with modern styling usually and typically stay at places like the W. This place did not look like my style at all from the photos. I was thinking it would be a musty old grandma type of place. And then I got there. Walking into the lobby is impressive. It's definitely an old European style that comes off horribly unless opulent enough to be glamourous and elegant. This place pulls it off. The staff at the front desk was very nice. The room was the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in. Big corner tub in the bathroom, HUGE vanity with stool, four comfortable chairs in the room, and wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling window with an AMAZING view (I could see the harbor from my room, along with much of the beautiful downtown area). The photos of the rooms you see on the site don't do it justice at all. There's sliding glass doors and a cute little Juliet balcony. It is a bit outdated (I can't remember the last time I've seen a tube television in any of the hotels I frequent) and the furnishings are older, but very well maintained. The location is unbeatable, walking distance to 100s of bars and restaurants, and about a 15 minute walk to the convention center or Petco Park. While I loved the room, the view, and the whole feel of the place, what really set it apart was the service. Every night at 8, (I was usually not in my room) they'd come in for turn down service. When I got back, the bedspread was removed, leaving a pretty white duvet , sheets turned down, chocolates, dressing robe, and a card on the bed with the weather for the next day, ice, free bottled water, and classical music playing...it was heavenly. The room service was friendly, fast and amazing. The big food portions were hot and delicious and in my room 15 minutes after I called, with all the trimmings and a fresh rose. The staff was kind and willing to help at every turn. Downsides: I mentioned the TV already, and the bed was a bit hard. Not an issue for me because I like a firm mattress, but it's far from one of the best I've slept in. There's a lot of street noise (maybe because of the big window?) but it's par for the course downtown.

We were in San Diego for a family wedding. Many activities were planned all over the San Diego area. The Westgate, located in downtown on the edge of the Gaslamp District, proved to be a very convenient starting point for all of them. I never had to drive more than 15 minutes to get anywhere. Our room was just beautiful. It was large, really large. I loved the dressing room that was separate from the bath. The shower had a seat, which is always a nice touch. The 2 queen beds were comfortable, the turndown service included two bottles of water and a full ice bucket as well as the usual chocolates on the pillow, the furnishings were well upolstered and plush. We could open our sliders and step out onto a narrow balcony (big enough to stand on but not big enough to accomodate a chair or table) with a lovely view of downtown, with the harbour visible in the distance. I found everything to be very clean. Another poster commented on the interesting \"suite-like\" configuration wherein there is a main door from the hallway that opens onto a foyer for two rooms across from each other. It certainly helps keep things quiet. Also, there was free, high-speed wireless internet in the room, which is something upon which I am becoming increasingly dependent when I travel. I had no problems with service. Check-in was smooth and we were directed immediately to our room in spite of having arrived several hours prior to the posted check-in time. Upon arrival in the room, I found that the airconditioning was not working. I called housekeeping and a repair person was in and out of the room within half an hour, and we had no further difficulties. I have never stayed anywhere with more efficient valet service. Even on weekend evenings when there are events at the hotel, I never waited more than a minute or two to take the car out. Rather than pulling up in front of the hotel, I always just drove the car down to the garage and left the key with the valet so there was never a wait at drop-off. The Westgate's style is definitely on the old-fashioned side in terms of style and furnishings. It is not in any way faded or run-down, but there are crystal chandeliers and gilt and embroidered upolsteries...think French Provincial. If modern, streamlined, less-is-more surroundings are more to your taste, then you may not like this much. Other family members (male) who also stayed there found it, while comfortable, a bit \"stuffy.\" The hotel is not quite a luxury hotel if the Georges V is your standard. There is the little something extra that the very best hotels offer mising here, but at $179/night for three (Thurs., Fri. and Sat.) nights and $209.00 for one (Sun.) night, it felt pretty darn luxurious to me! I should mention that there is a $28/night fee for parking. But even with the parking it was cheaper than many less well appointed properties. In all honesty, it was a steal! If I had a tour of the accomodations in advance and was asked to guess the price per night, I would have guessed in the $350-$400 range.

The front desk promised to send some up but no one ever came by. The second day after housekeeping came and went still left us with no soap. We had to make a run to the local CVS/Rite Aid to purchase our own. Our shower drain was plugged the first night so we notified the front desk when leaving the next morning. It was mostly cleared by the time we returned that evening. The full length windows and sliding door was nice to have and the view out of our tenth floor room was better than I've had in a long time. The king size bed was more of a queen but it did its job. Another nice addition was the semi private foyer that two rooms share. It cut down on ambient hallway noise I assume since I heard nothing but our neighbor come and go. Arriving after 9:00pm means no valet, but you can leave your keys with the desk and they will drive it around the corner to the Hotel Garage. The attendants in the garage are very efficient and quite nice even though they 'lost' our car for a few minutes each time we went to pick it up. Not a big deal as they found it quite quickly. There is a 24 hour fitness center and they supply a cooler of fruit infused ice water. Plenty of towels are available as well as headsets to use. It was never crowded and seemed quite clean. We sampled room service once and wasn't overly impressed but found nothing wrong with it either. The bread basket had a great selection though. Like the title states, I'm not sure what to think.

I had called earlier in the week to confirm my room and request a non smoking room with a bath tub. I spoke with Mrs. Markova and she was a delight. She informed me all of the rooms were non smoking. Upon arrival at 9 pm on June 1, we were greeted and told that we had been upgraded to a room with a bath tub. I was very happy as when I am vacationing I love to take baths. Upon arrival to the room I was very impressed with the high end decor and all marble bathroom. The room was spacious and elegant. I slept very well that night and my only complaint was the bad reception on the television. I shouldnt have been watching TV anyhow, I had to be up at 5. Our Next night there, June 2nd was great. the Westgate is right next to Horton Plaza, and within walking distance of all the Gaslamp Quarter. We walked everywhere. There were a lot of couples like us about as well as many business people. The downtown area is home to many homeless, but I was very happy to see homeless assistance squads interacting with them. It was not like they were forgotten by the city. This really impressed me. I have traveled a lot and have never seen this much assistance in action. That night we stopped by the bar at the Westgate during the happy hour and I got a wonderful Kir Royale for $7. The service was friendly and professional. Every time we passed by the front desk we were greeted with our name, with the staff had went out of the way to remember it. That night we ate at about 10:40 PM in the bar from the restaurants menu. I ordered the tortilla soup and my husband ordered the prawns. It was presented well and had the great flavor. Again, great service. That night the television had perfect reception. maybe it was a sign that I should have not been watching so late the night before. ;) Our sheets were lovely, and overall I would love to go back. Since we were leaving for a cruise, we were treated to a 2 PM checkout and we had the perfect amount of time to go eat and pack. Overall I would say that this is one of my most favorite places, and I have stayed at the St. Regis and The Ritz Carlton.

Lastly, the overall design of this location is Palatial to say the least, and the Ballroom is the most beautiful in all of the Southland, and is named Versailles, and I would definitely say that name is fitting The only thing thi hotel is missing is a pool, but it is more than made up for in many other ways.

When I tried to explain to the desk attendant they told me to call accounting when I returned home and they would refund the charge (which they now will not credit my card since I paid cash).

Trust me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had European service, you cannot judge outstanding service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where being a waiter is a career worth doing well, not a job you have during college because you can make good tips but if you get fired, no worries, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get another job. That is the difference and it seems the Westgate hotel recognizes this, and perhaps that is why they have an international staff. After valeting our car, when we arrived at the front desk, it was obvious the valet corresponded with the front desk as they called us by our name before my husband told them who we were. When we checked in, the clerk told us where the opera house was and told us about the pre-opera dinner at the hotel. This would normally not sound important but it means that when I booked our reservation, the call operator took a note of why we were visiting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to go to the opera and stay downtown afterwards. A note that the front desk clerk read and made mention of during our check in. She also asked us if she could walk us to our room, another simple service not frequently found in the US, except at the best hotels. While we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need someone to take us to our room, it was a nice gesture. The room was beautiful, and the marble bathroom compliments the antique decor. I mention this because sometimes in hotels or bed and breakfasts that use antique decoration, cleanliness sometimes suffers but this is not the case at the Westgate. It was very clean. The food was, by far, my favorite part. We decided we will make the trip again just for dining. Again, service was five star and the food was perfect. While I like trying different things, my husband was so impressed with the food that we had breakfast there in the morning. I learned the difference between homemade juice and fresh juice. The homemade juice is spectacular and unique.

We Pricelined the Hotel and won our bid at $70.00/ night. The rooms are just ok. The decor is a bit outdated. No flat panel TV. The chair upholstery is old. The carpet looked like it had a flood in the room and was severely discolored. I had to see if it was just discolored or really wet because it looked wet. It was dry but I think it was overly shampoo'd because my feet were a bit sticky from walking on it. The bathrooms are nice with marble but the grout is dirty. Caution! The tub is very slippery. It has those non slip strips on it but it is still very slick. There is a step out balcony which was nice. Wouldnt leave it open if you have a child there. The A/C Heater is not very functional, the room was always too hot or too cold. One thing we found weird was there is a hallway door to get to your room door and the room door is not marked once you get though the 1st door. It's a nice feature since you don't have to hear people walking up and down the halls outside your door and adds a bit more security but I think they should mark the actual rooms a better. We stayed on the 6th floor. There is a lot of noise from the street. But hey, you can't beat being right in the middle of the city. With that.... parking is expensive $28.00 a night!

The hotel charges $5 each way for shuttle service, but well worth $10 total for ground transportation (much cheaper than taxi). We arrived a little too early for check in, but the front desk secured our bags and had our cell number to notify us when the room was ready. We walked around outside in the warm California sunshine and quickly found a 7-11 very close to the hotel - nice to know a 24hr store is close by for any late night munchie attacks. My cell rang and the hotel was ready to check us in. Our bags were delivered to our room just minutes later. The hotel does not recognize a 13th floor, according to their rooms or elevator. Found that nostalgic. The room was clean and clean smelling. What a great king size bed and even better pillow selection available. The room is very spacious with a large vanity and seperate toilet and shower. The shower head seemed a bit low, I am 5' 11\" and and figured the shower head was only 5' 7\" high. No idea why. Large closet space for clothing. No wi-fi in the rooms, but you can plug in your ethernet cable to the outlet. If you forget your cable, like we did, you can purchase one inside your room for $8.00. Trust me, I forgot my cable and the mall across the street charged twice as much. We found wi-fi to be available in the lobby and was told there was wi-fi in the conference rooms - end of our connection problem. Each hotel staff member we encountered either in the hallway, lobby or front door were very cordial and ready to assist in answering any quesitons we had.

My first and lasting impression is that the rooms are HUGE! They really are! Checked in late, but had no problems.

They don't have free internet, but they have a cable you buy from the mini bar for $10 and then you're set for the duration of your stay. Better than some hotels that charge $9.95 a day. Turn down service every night, and they play soft music on your TV. Ordered room service one morning, and they were very fast and food was good. The decor has a little over-the-top Versailles feel to it, but it's not that bad. I had to laugh at one of the reviews below. The elevators ARE really slow. The foyer thing to the rooms is a little odd too, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it in other older hotels before. The annoying thing about the foyer setup is that you can hear the doors pretty loudly when you enter and leave your room. Luckily I had quiet neighbors.

What you are not close to is the convention center, however, the trolley stops right behind the hotel. It runs every 15 minutes to the convention center and costs $1.25.

The good, the bad and the ugly...\u201d", "Author": "Payam81", "ReviewID": "UR15150198", "Content": "I (along with my significant other) spent 2 nights at this property to attend a wedding beginning of April 2008. If you walk in here expecting a 5 star property like a Four Seasons or some of the 5 star Hyatt's you will be disappointed as this hotel is: In terms of decor, amenities and general facilities: At best a 4 star (Correctly reflected on Expedia star rating for this hotel) In terms of management, service and attendance: At best a high end 3 star. I will try to get in to the guts of stuff: Location ----------- This hotel is located in an area bordering the Gaslamp District so you will find a lot of nice restaurants to eat at. It's also very convenient to get to from the 5 freeway. We didn't go out much so I won't comment much here. Overall I give Westgate a 4 out of 5 here. Lobby & General Hotel Areas: ----------- The designers aimed to go for the \"antique\" look throughout the hotel including old looking yellowish lighting pretty much all over the place. This means without a powerful external flash most cameras will have a problem with white balance and pictures WILL come out yellowish. The sofas in the lobby need replacement as they are not in the best shape specially if you are trying to sell your hotel as a 5 star property! The one time I needed to use the Business center at around 11 AM on a Saturday it was closed with a \"Will Be Back\" sign for 12:30 PM! The Elevators must be the S..L..O..W..E..S..T I've ever encountered in any hotels! While there is enough of them (or so it appears) for some odd reason the wait is sometimes longer than (gasp!) 10 minutes! (I kid you not!) Overall I give Westgate a 3 out of 5 here. Rooms ---------- This is where the hotel actually did NOT fall too short. The rooms are generally of a very good size but the fake \"antique\" theme from the lobby and general areas continues here with similar yellowish lighting (albeit much more subdued) but the carpet needs a good cleaning as ours wasn't the cleanest. Also the design of the rooms here are such that they will open in to a foyer that you share with your neighboring room before reaching to a double door linking both rooms to the hallway. What does this mean? It means amongst shared access also shared noise from the next door room! Also, there is NO in room safe and NO coffee maker! Also the bathroom door knob while looking \"antique\" and nice falls short in ergonomics forcing us to use towels to avoid getting cut by the flawed design. The actual shower while looking all nice was: A: Not very clean, signs of mold clearly present. B: Not very easy to get in and out so be mindful as the tub has a long ledge. Bed was comfortable enough but no match for the beds in lower star rated hotels like Sheraton or Marriott. Overall considering they have just refurbished the rooms in 2007 I was not impressed at all. Overall I give Westgate a 3 out of 5 here. Service and Staff: ---------- This is where this property falls flat face down! Westgate, if you truly believe you're a 5 star (or even a 4 star) you NEED to get service right! This means you need to have your staff greet the guests at every occasion! You need to have staff who jump out of their way for a quest! You need to have staff who will proactively (and seamlessly) work together. None of these were present in this hotel at our stay. While the staff are generally nice there is nothing that will again justify the rating. They will feel at home at a chain national 3 star anytime! The exception was the Valet service which for $25 / Day (Ouch!) and as the sole option for parking wasn't too impressive but more attentive than some of the other staff we encountered. I particularly had a very hard time with the check-in when I tried to switch my room and extend a day at the same time, it took me 10 minutes of explaining in very simple terms for them to finally figure what was it I wanted and even at that they could NOT meet my needs. The concierge basically consists of a single person (who is very nice actually) so if you need service while she's on break or doing something then you're out of luck! This was the most understaffed concierge that I had seen at any higher end hotel. Overall I give Westgate a 3 out of 5 here. Restaurants and Quality of Food: ---------- I just had to comment here about the quality of the food. While we never attended the hotel's restaurant and couple of bars per se the food we received at the wedding (which WAS from the same kitchen as the hotel's restaurant) was just terrible! Although the bride and the groom had spent a staggering amount of money, had I received that food in any other occasion it would go straight back to the kitchen! The steak I got was over cooked and very firm something like an Airline rubber chicken! The presentation was just awful with some artichoke's laying messy around the plate along with a couple of cut carrots. If this is what they serve in their restaurant (which I'm pretty sure is) I'd recommend to stay away and just spend time in one of the great eateries in the Gaslamp district within 10 minutes walk. Overall I give Westgate a 1 out of 5 here. I guess by now you know I'm not a big fan of Westgate Hotel in San Diego CA and I would NOT recommend it to any of my own friend's or family, specially for the prices they ask. There are so many other options out there so unless you're drawn to fake antique look or yellowish lighting and are willing to put up with the deficiencies and specially willing to accept the fake 5 star rating then go right ahead, it is by no means a bad place to stay at, it's just not up to what it claims to be or the premium $ it charges for the privilege of letting you stay there. One last thing I remembered to mention, I read their internal hotel magazine and I had a few remarks on that as well: First of all Westgate, get a proper illustrator if you're serious about this! The layout and fonts are so amateurish it would hardly pass for a class magazine let alone the \"Premier Magazine of Westgate Hotel\". Secondly, STOP plastering pictures of your owners, your owner's sons and daughters, your manager and your manager's wife! Pretty much %50 of the 10 or so pages magazine was dedicated to these pictures. I just do NOT find this is very professional. To sum it all up: This is NOT a 5 star hotel. Heck, it's not even a very good 4 star at that either! I would accept it if it was a 3.5 star and would do away with the pretence and I probably would have rated it high accordingly but what they really need is a Four Season's opening in the area, which is just inevitable as there are none in San Diego, and that would give the management here a much needed kick in the rear.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westwood Los Angeles County, California", "Title": "\u201cI liked it\u201d", "Author": "ExperiencedTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR13817664", "Content": "We enjoyed how quiet the hotel was.

Pleasant experience from the moment we entered their lobby and checked in until the moment we left. The word elegant has been noted in several of the reviews and that is just what you'll experience. If you are looking for a chain property that is cookie cutter or cutting edge this isn't for you. Yes, some of the fixtures look a little worn and, no, they don't have flat screen TVs, but with everything else going for them we didn't miss those items a bit. Old world charm abounds from the lobby's ornate marble, amazing wood work, furniture and fixtures through to its unusually large-sized rooms that you just don't see anymore in the chain properties. Marble in the bathrooms, glass doors on the showers and a huge king bed made this a great experience. I'm a stickler for the staff/customer service component and this was a memorable experience in that regard too. Everyone greeted us pleasantly and even looked us in the eye whenever we came upon them in the lobby, elevators, front desk, etc. They actually held the front doors and elevators for us. You just don't see that anymore. Only hitch, my wife needed Internet access and due to a problem with their SBC connection she couldn't use her laptop for the Web. We ended up in the business center where a wonderfully friendly staff person, Linda, let us use one of the desktop PCs without cost and continued to push the property's IT dept. to fix the problem for us which they did. The lower concourse has the gift shop/business center, gym and parking. Gym was nice-sized and quiet so no trouble for me getting time on the equipment. We didn't have a chance to try the bar or restaurant, but would definitely do so on our next trip. The hotel caters to high-end receptions and has a great roof-top deck with fountains that our room overlooked. As for the hotel's location, it's right downtown so great to venture out and see the sights.

I booked a hotel through Hotwire, based on star rating and location in the Gaslamp quarter, and was pleased to find out we were staying at The Westgate. Despite a bland outside appearance, the interior architecture and decor of The Westgate has a European, and distinctly French, charm. The location to Horton Plaza and the restaurants/shops of the Gaslamp Quarter is certainly one of the main attractions to this hotel. (We even walked about 15 minutes to Petco Park for a baseball game). During check-in, we found the desk staff friendly and helpful. They upgraded us to a room on a higher floor. I was initially excited, but disappointed to step inside and have the NBC building directly across the street blocking much of the harbor view. The room itself was comfortable. Our bed was plush, with soft down pillows and a comforter. Two nightstands with marble tops were adjacent to the bed. In front of the sliding glass door to the balcony was a leather-topped work desk with complimentary Internet access. (Wireless is only available in the restaurant and bar). Also in the room were a chair and ottoman, television, DVD player, minibar, and phone with 2 separate lines. A bucket of ice was left during turn down service and a morning newspaper was delivered. The bathroom contained a vanity and an over-sized square-shaped marble shower/bathtub. ***The sides of the tub were very high and may not be suitable for those who have difficulty climbing in and out of a tub.*** Gilchrist & Soames toiletries were available as well as a hairdryer, two robes, an ironing board/iron and a vanity. The bathroom, although clean, felt run-down. The hotel really should repair the peeling wallpaper and consider better lighting. Valet service was quick, but the $24/night garage fee was ridiculously high, esp. for a hotel of this caliber. The other drawback to The Westgate is the traffic noise. Despite being in a room almost to the top of the hotel, the traffic noise on the street below was constant.

Our package included a harbor view room, one breakfast in bed, and one dinner at Le Fountainbleu, the hotel's 5* restaurant for a four night stay. While we enjoyed our bay view room we would not pay standard rates (approx. $395) for the lodging. Since the hotel is located a bit away from the bay there were a lot of downtown buildings that obstructed our view. From our room #1695 we had views from 12 to one o'clock and 10 to 11 o'clock. If you stepped on the balcony (no seating, just a small space to area out) you had better views from 8 o'clock 11 o'clock partially obstructed by buildings. I agree that the hotel could use a coffee/tea maker but that is our only other mild negative about the hotel. We enjoyed breakfast both in our room and at the Cafe Westgate. Prices were surprisingly decent and the fruit was very fresh and tasty with hot Tazo teas.

I should point out our first hotel was very overrated and expensive and the stay was unsatisfactory. We decided on this one in a hurry - and based our decision largely upon the reviews we read on this site. We arrived shortly after 12 noon and were immediately able to check into our room. It was clean and and roomy and looked exactly as the pictures on the website. At check in there was an emphasis on eating facilities throughout the hotel. We found the bed to be comfortable and the bathrobes were plush and a bonus (not provided at the first hotel). There was more than enough room in the dressing room. Decor was tasteful and traditional (almost renaissance style). Our room way at the rear of the hotel overlooking the trolley lines and initially we were a little concerned as we had stayed near the rail lines in the other hotel and it was horribly noisy. However, we found we never heard the trolley at all - it was actually quite peaceful - apart from hearing our neighbour open and close his door without consideration for others. The light in the shared foyer between rooms also kept us awake the first night - but we thought outside the square and made sure we turned it off when we went to bed the following nights. The hotel had advised of a function on one of the nights and indicated the elevators may be slower than normal between certain hours - the music for the event could be heard and it was horrible - however the function ended when the hotel said it would. The hotel offers a shuttle from to and from Balboa Park and Sea World at specified times - we used this and it was very convenient and puntual - as was the complementary shuttle to the airport. At check out the desk attendant could have been a little warmer - she was very effiecient but almost cold in manner - we considered this to be European efficiency - as indicated by her accent. She said we had mini bar charges - we did not use the minibar at all. She was very brusque! The conceirge was useless and was very confused about how and where to get to places. The one we dealt with spent time checking her text messages whilst tearing off a map and passing it to us - yet we had suitable maps and simply wanted to ask questions. We thought this was dreadful - a concierge should know virtually everything about a city and be willing to assist! Our biggest criticism regarded a package we were expecting. At checkin we informed the desk that this was expected. We double checked on the last business day of the week and were told this had not arrived - we had already been at the hotel for 2 days. We followed this up with a phonecall to the relevant company which had closed for the weekend. We were then travelling on to San Francisco on the Sunday. As a result we had to make repeated additional follow up calls to the business and to the hotel to find out where the package was. This is where the hotel lets itself down very badly! The package was received and signed for by a hotel employee prior to our checkout. We were told that the package was misaddressed and had the last letter on our surname missing so they assumed we were not guests. We asked that they forward it to us at our San Francisco hotel and were told we needed to call UPS ourselves. Instead we contacted the dental company and asked they sort the problem. When the package finally arrived in SF we checked the address label and whilst on one side the last letter of our surname was left off, our name was complete with hotel details on the flip side of the parcel. We feel this showed a clear lack of initiative and effort on the hotel side, particularly when we had said we were expecting the package. This cost a considerable amount of vacation time as well as money in long distance calls sorting out something that we should not have had to ourselves. This hotel also needs a coffee machine in the room - it wouldn't cost much to set each room up with one, especially when the coffee shop next door closes early and is not open at all at weekends.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cLaughably bad\u201d", "Author": "coreyfeldman", "ReviewID": "UR5835289", "Content": "Firstly, I have never been moved to write a review of anything before. Congratulations to the Westgate, for kicking me out of that apathy. My wife and I stayed a couple of nights at the Westgate as part of a honeymoon West coast trip. It wasn't that the hotel was appalling in any respect, but just that it has ideas way above its current station. It clearly views itself as a throwback to classic hotels of the past, with its much mentioned European bent. However, it has seen better days. In our experience while pitched at a genteel, sophisticated crowd a large proportion of the people staying there were partying students out to have a big night. Not a problem for us, but when thrown in with the Westgates 'individual' approach of having communal doors to two suites it resulted in us being woken at 3.30am, 4.15am, 5.20am as revellers sans keys returned to the suite opposite us. Not ideal when we were looking for some sleep after a long drive. Moved to a different room the next night, guess what - big shock, the same thing happened again. The staff were perfectly pleasant, but clearly feel they are living in the times when Princess Margaret and Kris Kristofferson (as they cheesily list in their guestbook) stayed there when in fact it is more Porky's. Added to which a slightly surreal member of staff who was paid to accost you at any moment to check you were ok. Furniture that was vastly out of place for the hotel. Thousands of staff idly standing by doing apparently nothing (we had 4 people serve us at breakfast, watched severely by 2 other senior staff in an empty breakfast room).

Shuttle service to and from the airport, zoo and Seaworld. We were lucky to even get one of the bellman to take us down to gaslamp district one night on his reccomendation to Taka. Good food. (Japanesse) Location is terrific. Close to trolley which can take you to old town. The bus is close also, we took it to Balboa Park to the museums one day. When at Balboa Park, eat at the Prado Restaurant. Awesome food and price is just right. The Westgate Cafe was elegant and perfect. Ate there two times for breakfast and once for dinner-one word, deliicious! For all of you ladies, go to tea which is served in the hotel lobby from 2:30pm-5pm. Fun, fun! The hotel is decorated so elegantly, but far from stuffy. The staff all make you feel at ease. Hope you enjoy your stay! We did, and plan to go back for a family trip with our daughter.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Westgate Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80590-Reviews-The_Westgate_Hotel-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$179 - $290*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1055 Second Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "80590", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/03/2e/032e7667702d226270945f2a63fc0cf51large.jpg"}}

We tried the Marriott and Holiday Inn Express, which of course were full. The Red Roof Inn in Homewood Alabama has taught us to STAY AWAY from them, so when we found the Artisan, we were okay with it. We drove into the dungeon to park. It was dark and dusty, but my kid loved it when the door closing made such an echo for about 20 seconds. The hotel was HOT. The room was an inferno. The smell in the rooms was distinctive, just not sure what it was. We got there around midnight, and unplugged the telly to charge phones, ipods, etc. so we never needed it. The phone on the desk was old fashioned, but who needs one of those? We had plenty of towels, took three consecutive showers with plenty of hot water. We checked out at 10am with free coffee from friendly staff. Never saw homeless people, the room wasn't the best, but okay. It reminds you of a 1970's Elvis era hotel. Do you go to Memphis to stay in a room. If so, you may not like this one. If you need a place to crash, this one works like any other budget hotel. And the rooms on the website?

Also the bathroom tiles were spray painted in white. All furniture was VERY beat up. Bathroom sink leaked on the bottom. It was snowing when we stayed there and the heater wasn't working. The carpet was filthy and had nail clippings that hadn't been vacuumed On top of this, the parking was spooky. It was underground. It reminded me of some sort of horror movie were you are in a filthy, gloomy underground parking were most of the lights are broken or blinking. It had no sort of night security whatsoever, AND anyone could come in. I was very concerned I wouldn't find my car the next morning, especially since Memphis has some of the highest crime ratings in the country. Right by the elevator was a sign that said that they were not responsible if your car got stolen. VERY COMFORTING! On top of all this, they charge you $6.50 for parking. This is on top of your rate, and they won't tell you about this until you leave. Very sneaky and almost fraudulent, since the booking was already prepaid. The elevators were nasty. Made horrible noises and stunk like cigarettes. The staff was nice, but dressed unprofessional. I was greeted by a guy that had a bandana on.

I chose this one because it is close to the FedEx Forum and other attractions, a good price for a hotel in the midtown area.

I don't even know if they have internet access since I did not attempt to use it. On Nov. 27 through 29, we went back (stop over from Dallas to Chicago).

The next morning, as we were leaving to go to the Memphis Zoo, we realized that the door does not lock automatically behind us. We waited for the maintenance guy for over an hour, the kids were starving and finally he came, we had to leave him in our room. The hotel did not even offer to move us to another room.

I complained to the front desk when I checked out and the clerk was even rude as if I did them wrong by complaining while there were other guests in the lobby. I asked for the manager's name and contact info so I can write a letter, she hesitantly gave it to me. If you can afford to stay somewhere else definitely avoid this hotel.

We liked it, it was really okay for us and for the price. We stayed there 4 nights in a row and then another night before our flight to Hawaii. The location is good, of course it is not in the middle of Memphis, but we took the bus to Beale Street (there is a bus station across) and a taxi for the way back. It is not a long way to Beale Street. And of course it is much cheaper than the Downtown hotels. We were on the top floor. We didn\u00c2\u00b4t hear any noise at all. The room was clean and comfortable with a big window. The view was very good. The room had 2 King Size bed, a table with chairs, TV and enough space for our many luggage. The bathroom was clean and had everything you need. The staff at the front desk was nice and friendly, maybe not like in a top notch hotel, but we found them okay. One evening I had a nice chat with the front desk girl. The elevator is a little bit old and shabby, they have two elevators, but only one worked. There is no restaurant or bar in this hotel, but I liked the lobby, it is very old-fashioned and dark but in a good way. On our arrival, we asked for a safe deposit box, but the man at the front desk told us, that the safe deposit boxes were broken. This sounded a little bit strange for me. So he suggested to use the hotel safe, what we did. He said, that only the manager has a key for the safe and the manager would be there from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm daily. On our check out day the manager was not in sight, although it was 10.00 am on a weekday. So nobody could open up the safe. We were a little bit angry about that because we needed our passports and other personal things. But the lady behind the desk called the manager and within 30 min. she was there. A little bit disappointed was the fact, that she didn\u00c2\u00b4t tell us, that she is sorry about the trouble and our wait. She said nothing, didn\u00c2\u00b4t even look at us. Maybe she was embarrassed. The parking garage is, as some said before, a bit dark and there is no gate, but that didn\u00c2\u00b4t bother us much.

The location is great from a Memphis perspective, walking distance to a drug store and restaurants but not to any tourist attraction. The biggest turn off, similar to another reviewer here, was theft with no appearance of forcible entry from a member of our party, stolen was a laptop, Ipod, professional digital camera, Nintendo DS, and a few other things. Again, with absolutely no sign of forced entry. I hate to cast aspersions on anyone but travelers should be aware of such things when choosing a hotel. This hotel has potential and years back I remember it being relatively nice when it was under another moniker.

The photos on the internet make this hotel look fine. However, at check-in there was an unattended ladder blocking part of the front doors, and we had to wait for the computers to \"change shifts\" to check in (at least that is what the rude general manager on duty said). The wheels on the luggage carts were about to fall off, and the carts themselves were in very poor shape. The under-hotel parking is not up to par, and is downright scary. There is a $6 daily charge for the \"privilege\" of parking in this sorry excuse for a garage. The ceiling in our room had quite obviously had a major water leak that had never been properly repaired. The central window could be opened, but the lock on the inside was inoperable, and there was a ledge below the windows. This, along with the fact the top lock on the room door had been taken off, certainly posed safety issues. There was no microwave and, more importantly, no coffee pot. When we asked another front desk employee about the coffe pot, we were told the hotel was owned by a Las Vegas hotel by the same name, where they almost never have coffee pots. We had one cup to go with the ice bucket, and had to go downstairs for another cup. There was no working ice machine on the at least two of the eight floors (we chose not to visit every floor in search of ice). The hallways smelled bad, the restaurant/lounge was not operating, and when we asked for a late checkout, a third employee said late checkout was noon (a mere 1 hour later than regular checkout time). This hotel needs a LARGE infusion of cash to COMPLETELY renovate it, and needs to have a NEW manager. Until that time, it should be closed down for even attempting to pass itself off as a hotel.

It was only $90/night, so it really wasn't too bad, but our room was on the top floor and they obviously hadn't renovated it yet. Room was kind of dingy, but I expected that for an old hotel. Just when I was thinking it wasn't so bad, I got in the bed and found DIRT AND BROKEN GLASS. Ok, it was a small piece of broken glass and could have been from someone's earring, but still. It was freaky. The bathroom was small and kind of moldy, and the shower was VERY small (there's a bar in there that you'll hit your arm on when you try to wash your hair, even if you are very thin like I am.) Also, try to take a shower when no one else on your floor is, becase there is almost NO water pressure at peak times. And the water temp. was always hard to control. It took about 10 minutes to get warm, and then became scalding hot. By the end of my 15 minute shower (it took that long for the lack of water pressure) I had the faucet turned all the way to cold and I was still feeling burned by the water. For the price and the fact that it was the only place left within cab-ride distance to Beale Street it wasn't too bad, I guess, but I will not stay here again. Note: if you are looking to stay here for the festival, remember you will pay $10-$15 in cab fare ONE WAY to Beale Street. And to get back at night it can cost $25-$30, if you can even find a cabbie that will go that far (yeah, apparently 3 miles is too far for cabbies off Beale St.). So if you can find a hotel closer that costs about $50 more, it's worth it. But if you do end up at the Artisan, try to ask if you can stay in one of their renovated rooms.

The hotel is a three-mile straight shot to downtown Memphis. They have an underground parking garage priced at $6.50 a night, and the price we got for our room was only $55, yet the room and the hallways were just nicer and had a little more character than the cheap motels you usually get for that price. They have a small outdoor swimming pool too! And the building has details that I appreciate--gilded mirrors in the elevator, for example. (Okay, only one of the elevators was working, but stairs are better for you anyway!) They have no in-room coffee makers, which would ordinarily send me right into withdrawal--but with a Starbucks a half a block away, that's not such an inconvenience. There's also a Walgreen's across the street, and within a short drive of the hotel is Overton Park, with a zoo and art museum and flowers and trees that were gorgeous in April.

My friend booked us those two rooms for 90.00 each per night. Then my other friends (there were a group of us in town for a function) were able to book a room for 59.00 each. Which may be the way the cookie crumbles when booking and bargaining on [--------------] so that is not my real complaint. So we still thought things were good when we checked in, the people looked professionally dressed, but then guy on duty mumbled everything when explaining the check in process and I had to ask repeatedly for him to repeat himself. Now, looking back I think he was hiding things in those garbled words. Still, the lobby looked pretty neat with those \"kitchy' decorations etc. and I seemed to have no reason to be wary. But once we were given our room key after being forced to sign some documents to check in, things took a turn for the worse, we parked in thier underground lot and had to search for the elevator (which the signs still said Ramada) which upon entering the elevator was found to be dirty, the we arrived at our floor, and walked down the dirty hall to our even filthier rooms. Just a sample: The shower curtain had a disgusting brownish goo all over it, the toilet seat was broken and dirty, the carpet was dirty, there was nothing comlimentary, except one bar of soap, no shampoo nothing else, then my friend found a little rolled up ball of steel mesh on the floor, which he said he had seen on a news show that people use that to smoke crack, then the cabinet holding the sink up in the bathroom had a piece the size of a basketball broken out of it, and I am glad that we didn't have any kids with us because the windows opened all the way (a good four and a half foot wide- I have never been in a hotel that didn't have safety devices to keep you from accidentaly falling out). But the worst experience of all was when we went to check out, they charged us an extra $100.00 because they said we were smoking cigarrettes in the room, which was not the truth, and then they said there was nothing we could do about it. When we protested and mentioned that the room was not clean or vacuumed and the shower curtain was nasty and the broken bits and any traces of cigarrette would have been from previous tenants as the place was not cleaned, the manager on duty said that they were undergoing a change of ownership and that those things - like the shower curtain -just needed to be replaced and I asked well, then why would you rent out a room like that? I think that they are using these extra charges to remodel the place (if they are remodling at all). I am trying at the moment to file a complaint with the Tennessee division of consumer protection but cannot remember the manager's name (no name tags) whom I spoke with and cannot find the number for the hotel online as we booked it with [---------]and the Artisan conveniently is not in the yellow pages and I think that they book all thier rooms this way so that one cannot call them later to complain and perhaps know that a person wishing to file a complaint with the state must provide information such as the telephone number and that works to thier advantage. Rent a room here if you wish, I just want to do my part to warn people about this place. Our experience ruined our entire trip. Don't say you weren't warned.

My colleague recomended the Marriott as the best option in the area, close to the client site we were visiting. I was able to secure a room at the end of the hallway with a great view of the lake. Two problems with the room though: First, the bed was somewhat soft...I always have this complaint. I need a good firm bed for back problems and the only thing I can do is sleep on the side of the bed that is least likely to get the most use. The other problem was that the room hadn't been dusted too well. There were some cobwebs in the bathroom and a layer of dust on the bathroom vanity. I don't think that room was used very much. In all fairness to the Marriott, I brought this to the attention of the front desk upon check-out and they \"made it right\" for me, which I greatly appreciated. But I am always surprised that hotel housekeeping doesn't keep a more careful eye on such a basic issue. One suggestion: rent a car if you are staying on this side of Indy. The cab ride was $80 from the airport and there is no shuttle available at this hotel even though there is a large mall with a Nordstrom just a few blocks away. A hotel shuttle to the mall would have been a nice amenity but I guess most guests drive. Next time, I will rent a car because the Indy airport is really easy to navigate and the rental car lots are right at the airport, no rental car shuttles necessary. I did like the workout room very much. Nicely equipped and open 24/7. I didn't have to wait for a cardio machine. Yes, I will return to this Marriott if I need to come back to this area next time.

I love Marriott properties as I always find them enjoyable. I have actually stayed at the Marriott East in Indy before, and found that this property was closer to where we needed to be this time. We paid about 109.00 online booked straight thru the Marriott(no priceline,etc) and was happy with the price,but didn't expect as much as we received. I'd read the reviews and saw that the hotel rated #10 of hotels in Indy, and thought that was great. I was pleasantly surprised when we pulled up to the hotel and saw what looked like a plush expensive property. This hotel is GORGEOUS!!!!!! The lobby is large and spacious. When I got to the front desk at 3:45 Indy time,(check in 4:00) the clerk told us our room was not quite ready. After waiting for about 25 mins no one said anything to us yet. My husband went back to check on the room and the clerk gave us another room which was better than the one we were supposed to have. It boasted a beautiful balcony that we enjoyed sitting on and looking at the ducks swimming in the nearby lake/pond. We had a king size bed and my son had a air mattress. All of our accomodations were clean and very comfortable. (I wanted to take the bed home) The room was spotless. The desk clerk called up to check on our room. Wonderful service!!! This hotel is located near many shopping places and restaurants- our favorite being The Cheesecake Factory directly next to Sax Fifth Avenue. The TV was another plus, a FLAT SCREEN HD TV!!! We don't have HD at home so that was definitely a treat. I did need to use the business center to print out menus for the nearby restaurants. The business center is amazing. It was about 4 HP Slimline Computers with Flat Screen Monitors, Laser Printers, Fax Machines, the works!!! Check out was a breeze as well.

We were greeted nicely at the counter and given a quick check-in. I had trouble with the TV where I had audio but no video.

I had another problem with the TV and I called the front desk again. I explained the problem and they sent a service person up and he was there in about 1 minute and fixed the problem. The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was very comfortable. Our room overlooked the parking lot on the 5th floor so there wasn't much to talk about there but we were only spending one night and the view wasn't important but if you're staying a while I would ask for a room on the side that faces the lake. Room service was very prompt even though the girl at the front counter told us it would be up to two hours to get our meal due to how busy it was which seemed a bit strange to me. We had our meal within 20 minutes. Food was above average from the Bistro. We ate breakfast in the Bistro but had bad service from the waiter. It was maybe 10 minutes before we saw anything of him when we were seated and then another 10-15 minutes to come back with drinks. We ended up going up to the Buffet due to his lack of attention figuring it would be quicker service. They had a good selection of food which was pretty tasty. Again, the waiter was no where to be found for refills of our drinks. When asked for more coffee, he forgot but eventually showed up with our bill.

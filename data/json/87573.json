I think it is a good base from which to explore Chicago - we could walk most places easily and although a fair distance from the Magnificent Mile we did walk there from the hotel. We also walked to the Field Museum area and the view of the skyline from the museum area is fantastic(I would recommend). Our room and bathroom weren't huge but were perfectly manageable and most importantly clean. The bed was large and very comfortable. Our only slight problem was the noise from the fridge which did keep us awake (although jet lag probably didn't help either) but we got used to it after the first night. Having said that, it was still useful to have a fridge in the room so we could store drinks. We were fortunate to have a view of Grant Park from the room which was great.

Granted, it's not in the Mag Mile area, but I actually think that is a plus rather than a negative. We did not use the hotel shuttle, as we found the Chicago transit system to be quite handy. The nearest L station (Roosevelt) is a little bit of a walk, but there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, and it takes you to the streets where you can catch the train. I strongly suggest buying a transit pass to be able to hop on and hop of the trains and buses. The Museum Campus is not really within easy walking distance, but it's a very easy bus ride. The hotel shuttle did not really fit our schedule, but no complaints, because Chicago public transit is great. The hotel staff was helpful. Given that the hotel does not currently have dining, we were especially grateful about the detailed directions concerning the options that were within walking distance. Our one and only issue that was not quite perfect was that, the first day we were there, the heat was on even though it was a rather warm day, but I think that was just a function of how unseasonably warm things were. It's an older property, and the heating and cooling system is probably not as sophisticated as a fancy new place, but we still did okay, and we did need the heat when things cooled down some. So much of the discussion of Chicago tourism focuses on the Mag Mile, but honestly, I think that the Loop and South Loop have plenty going for them, and somehow, it does not seem quite as cookie-cutter touristy as the things further north on Michigan Ave. seem to be. This place is perfectly fine for folks who are used to mid-level accomodations.

There was no microwave as we were told over phone. Basically it was just an awful experience. What was really scary is they told us to just open the window. We were up 11 floors, our daughter is older so we were able to do that but what if other's with small children were told that and while they were sleeping the kid fell from the window? Just fix the air people. And while doing that fix the pool so people can get their money's worth because it was working when we booked there or we wouldn't have.

The hotel is well located on South Michigan within a few blocks of an El stop and the subway. The hotel is within walking distance of Millennium Park and the Art Institute. There is a park across the street where many people jog and walk their dogs- it seems to be a very nice neighborhood and I always felt safe walking back from the train or museum, even later at night. The rooms are small but nicely updated. There is a mini-fridge in a cabinet under the TV. However, there was no microwave in the room or available to guests in the lobby area. There were plenty of TV channel selections. The heating system did not have thermostat control- it was either heat is on or off- but I learned to turn off the heat at night since I like it cooler to sleep. The windows open if only a tiny bit- that is a little perk that I always look for because it is nice to hear the street noise and get some fresh air. The bathroom was small but fine for just me- it would be hard for a couple to get ready in the same small space, though. There was not a full-length mirror in the room or the bath. The hotel had one of the nicest pool, sauna and fitness areas I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen! There was always a friendly lifeguard on duty. The pool area has a bin full of pool toys like kick boards, balls and rings to toss as well as games like checkers and chess on the tables that surround the pool. The gym has plenty of cardio and strength equipment. Parking on site was slightly more expensive than surrounding public lots but included in/out privileges and was much more secure. For the difference of about $15/day it was worth it to me to know my car was in a supervised area. By far the best thing about the hotel was the service- from the front desk to the valet staff to the lifeguards to maintenance. I checked with the front desk every time I took the train to be sure I was picking the best stop to get to my destination. They made great restaurant recommendations and had plenty of menus on hand. When a channel on my TV didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, they sent maintenance up within two minutes of my call (around 9:pm) to take a look. The lifeguards treated me like a friend.

NOt even bottled water that you can purchase in the room. They also dont have ice machines on every floor. They do have vending machines though....but i got robbed four buckets because they didnt dispense anything.... They do offer free wifi...but its extremely slow (like your page with take a long time to load slow thats if it loads) but you can always upgrade for a fee hahaha I guess in this case you really get what you pay for.

We did a gospel brunch at the House of Blues, and our flight did not leave until later in the afternoon. He was told that the hotel did not provide extensions for check out, and that if we wanted to keep our luggage in storage rather than hauling it all across the city, it would cost $.50 per bag. I have stayed in plenty of hotels, and have never had to pay a hotel just to store luggage! If you are looking for a hotel that just provides the basics such as a clean room, somewhere to sleep and a decent location this is the hotel for you. However, don't expect more.

I had researched several hotels on the internet before we decided on Essex. Honestly I knew it wasn't gonna be the best hotel but there are a few things that people should know before staying here. When we walked in the front desk had us reserved for 2 rooms.. We originally were going to have my teeneage son with us. I'm not sure if they were being nice and thought maybe we would want an extra room or maybe they know that their rooms are pretty small and thought after seeing it we would want another room. We also asked for a smoking room not knowing if there were any smoking areas in or outside the hotel. We were reserved a non-smoking room.. They also fixed that. The front desk staff were very pleasant although besides checking in and checking out we didn't need them too much.. The biggest issue I had was the temp of the hotel. There isn't a way to control the room temp so u get whatever it's set at.. We had to have the window open beacause it was unbearable and it was quite noisey from the traffic and people outside yelling all night long.. I even heard a staff member yelling good night to coworkers at 4 a.m.. We weren't the only ones complaining about the heat. I talked to several people in the elevator and they all had the same problem. As for the pool we did use that as well as the sauna both evenings. It may have been a little chilly but nothing that the body doesn't get used to after a couple of minutes. It was a great way to relax after a day of a lot of walking and kept my girl busy for awhile. We did use the ice machine.. no problems..We didn't use any of the vending machines because we brought our own snacks..Just know that u cannot take coolers in the hotel but they have small fridges in the room. So we brought a small cooler in the truck and just transported the food. Free internet was great as well to look for food places since you are kind of far away from most eating and shopping. We tried Yolk and it was fast, friendly and yummy.. about 30 dollars for the three of us and its 2 blocks south right on Michigan.. Oh and the last thing the hotel has a shuttle to the museum but they do not bring you back. buses are cheap it cost about 5 dollars for us to get back.. Overall I may or may not stay here again.

There are many other hotel values available in the area around the same area. You just have to read the reviews. Reputable and customer driven hotels (quality hotels) are clear to see. This hotel is not one of them. My wife planned an overnight stay just to get away for a special evening downtown. She was duped by the hotel website into planning a stay. Everything was planned and we were excited to go. I work out of town and when she told me where she made reservations I searched the hotel on the internet . I was not pleased initially, but figured we would give it a try as I was anxious to go and reservations were made. As luck would have it, I found out late Friday that I would have to leave Sunday morning to a new job site. The Saturday overnight stay would not allow me time to prepare for Sunday. It turned out because of my job, we would have to cancel our reservation. I called the hotel in the morning and the man in reservations said he would cancel our reservation, but the hotel would still charge me for the night. I was not aware that there was a 24-hour cancellation policy, but it is in the fine print on the website, it is stated. I asked him if there was anything he could do to help me out. He said no. I asked about a voucher possibly. There was nothing. I asked to speak to the manager.and got the same results. I work for a company where one of my responsibilities is customer satisfaction. I understand well the value of customer satisfaction. Although, by rule, the hotel is right charging me a nights stay, but I guess what bothers me more is the smug attitude and careless response I got from reservations as well as the hotel manager. From what I've read in the reviews, this is normal. What great diplomats for people visiting our Great City of Chicago! I wish this operation would go away. Hopefully I can do my small part in making that happen. Take my advice. Spend a few more dollars and stay at a hotel that you will enjoy. I'd hate to see you throw your hard-earned money away staying at a place where they could care less about their guests. It pays to check the hotel reviews on this or similar websites.

I found a place called \"Thai Spoon\" at the corner of Wabash and 6th street that was a cheap eat, and was maybe a 5 minute walk, most of which could be through the Chicago Hilton right next door to this hotel.

The room was perfectly adequate. They have an antiquated heating/cooling system here that's either heat or cold not both. You adjust the temperature essentially by adjusting the fan speed. The room must have been 100'F when I walked in, but you can open the window, and after turning the fan off, it took about 2 hours on a cold November day to cool the room off.

For those who watch TV, they have a wide-screen TV and a greater number of cable TV channels than any hotel I ever stayed at. The bathroom was small and crowded but adequate. The shower/commode is in a separate room from the sink. It was hard to go into the john and close the door, so I just left it open, which might pose a problem if you're not alone. There wasn't any really good place for the coffee maker in the room, so they keep it in the piece of furniture the TV sits on, and you have to move it over to the miniature bathroom and plug it in there, crowding out your toothbrush and dental floss in the already crowded area. No big deal. The gave me extra coffee 'filters' since I'm a caffeine nut, and remembered to do that every day after I asked the first day. The stopper in the sink was permanently closed when I got into the room, and I propped it open with a shoehorn, but by the third day they had fixed it automatically. I think the tub drain was very, very slow, almost stopped up, and it was that way the whole time. I never complained about it to the management. There was a report of bedbugs here, as for most of the Chicago hotels, and I purposely brought one of those little LED high-intensity flashlights to do a thorough room inspection before unpacking. I really tore the bed apart, and saw that they had (correctly) enclosed the mattress inside of a case that was sealed with a cable tie that couldn't be opened. The box spring was also free of any evidence of bugs, and I got down on my hands and knees and carefully looked in places they never vacuum and saw absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any varmints. I was also pleased that the bed coverings were white, which would be make any evidence of bedbugs easier to spot since their excrement causes brown streaks which I saw none of. At all. I felt safe. Kudos to the management here! I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have free in-room wireless internet that's unfortunately pretty slow. I clocked it at ~30 kB. Better than dial-up but the slowest download speed I ever saw in a hotel. (My low-end broadband at home is ~170 kB.) You can pay a daily fee (~$6-10? depending on the speed) and get faster service, which is obviously the idea, but for just checking e-mail and such it was perfectly adequate. They do have a business center which might have faster (?plug-in) internet but I never sought it out. Sound proofing was not great but adequate. I heard doors opening and closing in neighboring rooms. No big deal. The elevators were a little slow. The people at the desk and the bellmen were most helpful and it was speedy checking in and out. There's a nice waiting area in the lobby where you can wait for friends or transportation. I originally chose this place because of the exercise facility and pool but was so busy I never got to use, much less even see the facility. It's there if you want a workout. They have a free shuttle bus that goes up and down Michigan Ave. The driver was kind enough to go out of his way for me, and take me to a place that's not normally on his route. All-in-all, an excellent choice. Reasonably priced on Chicago standards, convenient, and mostly well maintained. The personnel were friendly and helpful. I'd recommend this hotel and stay here again any time.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cGoing to Chicago?

There were 6 adults and 4 young kids in our group. It must have been a busy weekend because we had a hard time finding a reasonably priced hotel in the downtown area and ended up at the Essex Inn. Overall it was a good hotel stay - the location was across the street from the Field Museum and Millennium Park, which the kids loved - and it was close to a very good breakfast place called Yolk, which is a couple of blocks south of the hotel. If we had to, we would stay here again, although it wouldn't be our first choice. Pros: + Decent location + Reasonable price + Heated indoor pool (kids loved it!) + Clean rooms Cons - Smaller room size (tiny bathrooms) - Inability to control the heat/cooling - it's central unit that you really can't change - Charges for wireless Other notes: We had requested, upon booking, that our rooms be adjoining, but when we got there they could not accommodate our request. Unfortunately we ended up on 3 different floors, although all at the same end of the hotel, so the back-and-forth wasn't too bad. Our room had a decent view and the windows went all the way to the floor, so our kids thought that was super cool. My brother and sister-in-law's room seemed to have issues regulating the temperature so they were constantly battling with being too hot or cold. They eventually asked for a different room and the hotel did accommodate their request fairly quickly. The room they moved into was ok, temperature-wise. The valet parking is pretty expensive at the hotel itself ($34+ per day), but if you don't mind public parking lots there is one right behind the hotel (1 block directly west) where the daily rates were like $18 a day.

You could take the metro to some of these destinations, but I enjoy walking. The hotel itself was older but the rooms were remodeled and were newer. The windows was what made me nervous after reading reviews. There were full windows on two sides of our rooms and other reviews said that you it was very loud. While the windows weren't soundproof it didn't keep us from sleeping. The beds were also very comfortable. The hotel staff was great and always willing to help us with whatever we needed. However it is Chicago and it is an expensive city so be prepared for them to charge you for everything, including plastic silverware! One block behind the hotel started to get a little sketchy at night, but I think that was just because it was less traveled and other than Michigan Ave they didn't make much effort to remodel and spruce up those streets (that is out of the center of town -the center of town was all very detail oriented and beautiful). We booked this hotel through priceline - we did the \"name your own price option\" we ended up getting this hotel for about $100 a night. So for the money we paid it was well worth it.

Good The fitness room was roomy and had a good range of equipment for a hotel. The only thing missing were a couple of floor mats.

The room was a decent size with flat sreen TV and seemed clean. The noise from the train was not an issue. Poor The sink had no plug and the cover for the drain hole in the shower kept coming loose. We only had a shower which was small for the size of room. Also on our first day it was very difficult to get warm water in the shower but after that it settled down. The colour scheme in the hallways was dark and gloomy, a lighter scheme could have made such a difference. There was no booklet in the room about the hotel or the area. The reception was one of the smallest I have seen. There was little interaction with staff Indifferent The location ok and you could walk into the centre or use the bus stop across the way. If coming by train from O'Hare select your station carefully to minimise the walk and look at the loop. Can someone please tell me why in this day and age we have to pay a charge of $5.99 for wi fi. This is not the only hotel to do this. I believe the Hard Rock at their rates still make a charge. Look I don't expect something for nothing. Bearing in mind most people will want to access wi fi why not just raise the nightly rate slightly and all customers share the cost.

When we were finally able to check in, we went up to our level and made our way through the dark hallway. Our room was tucked into the corner wing, the door was adjacent to another room, the layout was very strange and unexpected, it felt a little bit seedy. Once in our room, everyone made a joke about how small the bathrooms were, if two adults were to walk past each other, it would cause a traffic jam. The picture from another traveler with his hands over the sink was not digitally remastered. The sink was very small, not that it mattered. The amenities were very bleak. Some soap, shampoo and lotion in the bathroom. The room did not have any channel directories for the TVs (we had 2) and there were no booklet giving hours of the pool and sauna. The Positives: - the concierge was very friendly and responsive, we needed a wine bottle opener, and they somehow came up with one and delivered it to our room. - the queen beds were very comfortable. - we had a nice view, extending out to the Planetarium and the lake. - the pool was nice, they had floating pads and noodles for the kids. I've read some people complaining that it gets overtaken by children, but I can't really complain since our party had two kids under the age of 12. The Negatives: - check in is at 4:00 pm and checkout at 11:00 am, which I didn't feel it was long enough for a traveler who pays a nightly rate during peak season. - we heard the train at night. It wasn't enough to keep us up, but the noise wasn't faint either. - we found a hair and stain in the pull-out bed, but again, the employees were gracious enough to bring a whole set of sheets and pillows once we called the front desk. - the AC stopped working in our room. It wasn't an issue with us since we're more warm-blooded anyways, but I can see how it may annoy other travelers. The info-you-need-to-know: - check in is at 4:00 pm and checkout at 11:00 am. - Pool closes at 10:00pm - the hotel does not allow you to bring a cooler, not even as a storage to transport drinks to the rooms and back to the vehicle. - they have wi-fi, at $6. - no complimentary breakfast. - there is a free shuttle, which we didn't take advantage of. Couple of the destinations are; John Hancock Tower and N. Michigan Ave. You'd have to call and check what the times were. - the bellhop can store your baggage if you wanted to do more sight-seeing after checkout, but they charge $0.50/bag. For a party of 6, we had to pass. I didn't appreciate how they nickel-and-dime you. - there is a in-room fridge and coffee maker.

We were feeling great about Chicago, and great about the day before heading home. The damage is on the bottom and side... looks like the valet driver had a smaller, lower red car and turned too close to my van when parking. Gave my van a nice scratch and dent with the other vehicle's front bumper. We were so busy filling the back of the van with suitcases that we missed the damage until we stopped for food about 20 minutes out of town. We called immediately... had to wait about 10 days for the claim to go through. They didn't ask for photos nor did they ask for much information at all; so we suspected we were going to be left high and dry. Basically, since we can't prove they did it... we're on our own to flip the bill. And since, technically, the connected parking garage is a separate business from the hotel, the hotel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept responsibility either.

The rooftop garden is really nice but it would have been fun to be able to sit out there and order a glass of wine to watch the city go by. The rooms were comfortable and the bed was great. The showers were a little small but not unlike any older hotel. The key card had an ad on it which says purchase Shedd VIP tickets at the hotel front desk. When I went to the front desk, no one seemed to know about what the VIP tickets meant and couldn't tell me what the price difference was. The website offers free shuttle services which makes several stops on Michigan Avenue, etc. We took the shuttle to the Shedd Aquarium on the first day we were there. The driver not only dropped us off at the Field House and advised us to walk to the Shedd, when I called to ask what time the shuttles ran to pick people up, I was advised they don't pick up anyone, it's only drop off service. The person I spoke with said we TOLD you we don't have pick up service and NO, he didn't. Otherwise, I would not have expected it. We had to take a cab back to the hotel. When we checked out, we asked if they would hold our bags after we checked out because we wanted to go to one more museum before we took the train. They held them for us at a fee of 50 cents per bag...can you say \"nickel and dime your guests\"?

The hotel is in a great location close to the Museum Campus which includes the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum of Natural History and the Adler Planetarium and opposite Grant Park and the Millennium Park (adults as well as kids love the Bean and its good to play in the waters of the Crown Fountain on a hot day ) It is also right next to a trolley stop which will take you downtown. In addition the hotel provides a shuttle service to Water Tower Place with all its shops, on N Michigan Ave. This takes 14 people and is on a first come first served basis. It is popular so if you cant get a lift, you can walk to the Magnificent Mile about 10 blocks so not too bad depending on the weather. The hotel restaurant, the Savoy is quite good but very expensive, beer being $6 a pint which is double what you pay in most bars and while we did not have breakfast we were told it was around $15, we paid just $2.85 in diner round the back of the hotel, on Wabash, for a cheese bagel, egg, sausage and a coffee.

We arrived at 1pm and were greeted by Drew, who immediately assured us being early was no problem and that they had a king size room available. He then collected our tickets from the safe and handed them to us with our room keys. We went straight to our room and were delighted with a side view of the lake and the museum campus. The bed was enormous and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was clean with plenty of clean towels, replacement toilet paper and face tissues were in a cupboard underneath the sink. The fridge was quite large and there was a good supply of tea, coffee, creamer etc with the coffee machine. Replacements were made daily. Towles and bedding were changed frequently. The pool was really warm and there were plenty of sun loungers around the pool and out on the patio. Towels were supplied at the pool and the showers were hot with an abundant supply of shower gel/shampoo and conditioner. Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times. Taking time to show us places on the map and giving very accurate directions. If it is your first trip to Chicago then go to the Cultural Centre and book a tour with a Chicago Greeter. We did this online before our arrival. The greeters are volunteers and ask for your interests. We took an architectural tour of downtown and a trip to Wrigleyville. We went into buildings that you would walk passed and saw ceilings by Tiffany etc. The tour was 4 hours long. The service also includes a day pass for CTA transport. This amazing service was free and the greeters are not allowed to take a tip. Our greeter contacted us via email prior to the trip and answered queries we had before we arrived. Hackneys provides a good meal at reasonable prices and can be found on Dearborn and Printers Row. Bar Louies is a sports bar and offers a wide range of meals. They run a variety of offers on a daily basis. Can be found on Dearborn. For a trip back in time Ed Debevics is a fifties style diner. Their trademark is rudeness! Found on North Wells and Ontario. If looking for an alternative day a visit to the Science and Industry Museum is well worth it.

Free shuttle to the Museums and to the Hancock Observatory (and the Miracle Mile shopping district). Probably a 15 to 20 minute walk to the Millineum park, a great way to stroll along the lake shore.

I don't know how they pay for the heating bill. Water is very warm (at least this week). I've never seen a lap pool in a hotel.

Coffee maker with convenient 1 cup dispensing and not having to rely on the maid to clean the pot with her toilet brush.... Just kidding. Nothing needs to be washed by the maid as the coffee tray and filter is disposable. Down side: A definite read if you are picky..... NOISY.... As opposed to the Hilton next door (an old and decrepit building) with tiny windows..... The Essex made a mistake with a full glass wall. Sure, it gives you plenty of natural light .... But ... It is not sound proof. And all the train and subways -- it sounds like you are sleeping in a train. One goes by almost every 5 minutes until midnight... Then it continues less frequently till the morning. Ambulance siren, etc. at least once in the night. The loop area is frequently by beggars. I saw more here than any other big cities on Michigan ave and the side streets. They are not too aggressive, but annoying. Most don't ask for a buck, just loose change. PARKING: cost $39 at the hotel. A lot just two block east on State St, and several on State are $8 for early birds, and $10 a day. Free parking is available near the Museums up till 11 AM, and on weekends. But check the \"free parking\" website for changes. There are many segment of street with free parking .... But why risk your life walking? Ten bucks two blocks away is not too much. If you are planning a trip with the kids - it is a perfect place to hit the museum, see the lake, and tour the Hancock observatory. I would buy the tourist CTA card (do not pay cash like we did - and wasted a huge amount of money). The regular CTA card cost $2.25 a trip, 25 cents a transfer (within 2 hours of the first trip) - so you can go to Chinatown for lunch and back for just $2.50). But a tourist CTA card let you go as many places and as many transfer as yo want for just $5 or less a day. I think there is a weekend fee also on the CTA, but you will have to read their website to learn more. Don't worry about taking public transportation from the Union Amtrak station to the hotel - as taxi cost only $7 for 2 people one way. Not worth the headache to use the bus and transfers. I would love to go back to this hotel again. But chances are, it will cost double what I paid this time.

The biggest complaint I have about the room is the air-conditioning. It was extremely hard to control the air-conditioning, and it got many of us sick. The pool was good sized, and nice. However, the water was FREEZING, and it made swimming much less enjoyable. The sauna was nice though.

We met about 4/5 of the diner staff. 3 of them were lovely and chatty and the other 2 were really grumpy!!

My room was 1216 on the 12th floor and it was very clean,Very spacious and had a huge floor to ceiling window which looked out across Grant/Milenium Park over Lake Michigan which was incredible. I had a huge flat screen tv with too many cable tv channels to count which was great and a bed that could probably have fit 4,as well as a large bathroom with the bath/shower combination,nice handbasin area and all of the usual hotel amenties hairdryer,iron,shampoo,conditioner,tea/coffee facilities etc. The only thing i would say about this hotel is that for a solo traveller like myself its quite a isolated area for the hotel as its not near the main attractions and at night it can become quite a shady area as its near the empty park and the elevated railroad passings which tends to host a lot of shady looking people,lots of homeless waiting around the corners to ask you for money and a few hustlers. Now by no means dont let that put you off of going there as the most of them are harmless and will ignore you if you leave them alone but for maybe a solo female(s) or younger guests it may be something that would make you feel uncomfortable but the solution to this would be if you are going from uptown to the hotel in the evenings maybe to take a cab or stay on Michigan avenue to the south end of it where its more populated before you turn into the hotel rather than taking the backstreets near the railroad. Overall I would recommend this hotel and stay there again as it was a very good hotel with value for money and everything that i could of asked for.I would recommend it to everyone but with the added fact that solo travellers like myself especially for young solo female travellers to plan how you will get to and from the hotel before you actually go out to avoid any unwanted encounters.", "Date": "November 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay\u201d", "Author": "vegasbud", "ReviewID": "UR21689871", "Content": "We stayed at the Essex for 4 nights starting on the 01 Nov, I thought it great value for money.

There was also a fitness room. TV had plenty of channels. The pillows weren't the greatest, but that's mostly because we're so used to our very own, comfortable bed and pillows.

The Essex pretty much matched these expectations. We booked our hotel through a travel agent who used a 3rd party hotel wholesale company. We got a great weekend rate of $150/night including tax, which is about $129/night before taxes. Parking would have been an additional $30/night, but we parked in a public lot around the corner from the hotel for $12/night. Also, parking at some meters on the street is free after 9pm on Saturdays and all day Sunday. Since we booked through the wholesale company, it was not possible to confirm a nonsmoking room (as a former travel agent, I know this is common practice). And since we checked in at 8pm on a Friday night, the hotel was fully booked and there were only smoking rooms left. The room was very smoky smelling, as was the entire floor as soon as the elevator doors opened. The desk staff was gracious in finding us a different (though still smoking) room for Friday night and then moving us to a non smoking room for Saturday night. We had a room with 2 queen beds, which are really 2 full-sized beds. My husband and I sleep in a queen bed at home, but slept in separate beds at the Essex because there's no way we would have been comfortable in one bed. But the sheets were clean and the beds were comfy. The bathroom was clean, but not exactly gleaming, due to its need for updating and refurbishing. We did not use the pool or sauna, but only because we were out and about much of the time. Overall, this is a decent, no-frills hotel if you don't want to break the bank to be in downtown Chicago. The desk staff was courteous and the bellman was very friendly and helpful in directing us to public transportation. We spent much of our time at the funky bars and restaurants in the Lincoln Park area, which is probably where I would stay on future trips.

Normally we stay in the River North Area but unfortuantely most of the decent hotels in that area were booked. So, we decided to book at the Essex and were very hesitant about it at first because it was an unfamiliar place and the reviews were not favorable. I was pretty much expecting the worse. Here are the positives about our stay... 1)checked in at 11:30 a.m. with no problem 2)free shuttle to the Pier (every hour) 3) free shuttle pick - up from the Hancock 4) immediate action concerning the fresh stains on our room carpet (great job housekeeping and the manager on duty!!!) 6) location (across the street from Grant Park = Buckingham Fountain 7) Savoy Bar and Grill (wide variety of items) 8) valet parking 9) 4th floor heated swimming pool and deck area (pool had to be about 75 degrees) The negatives...... 1)Valet parking (I cringed at paying 29.00 a day, we normally stay at a hotel that offers free parking to its guests) 2) room seemed too small for 2 adults and 3 young kids (we had 2 double beds) 3)location (other than grant park there wasn't much else in the area that we really wanted to see) 4) Savoy Bar and Grill prices were too high 5) rate I paid of 270.14 total Overall, we were satisfied with our stay at the Essex. Even though we weren't in a familiar area the Essex made it easy for us to get to our main destination (which was the pier). We were able to take the shuttle to the pier, then walk to the Hancock and then be picked up and taken back to the hotel. The kids enjoyed the pool and sitting outside on the terrace. I guess I just kind of wonder what the other posters expected. I by no means expected to be pampered but we were pleased with the hotel and with the customer service given by all staff and the immediate attention they gave to our problem.

The problems with check-in and check-out are ridiculous. The bottle neck created by the queue of people trying to move around make it very awkward to speak to the receptionists.

I have never had to pay for a luggage room before, and I heard others around us complaining about the same thing. The dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was delicious, but it was when we paid our bill that we got ticked off. Though the waitress and the service were excellent, she placed our bill on the table before we finished eating, leaving out much chance of having a drink or dessert after dinner. What really annoyed us was that she had already added a gratuity of 18% onto the bill before we got it. I can understand this being automatically added to a bill when its a large party, but I've never seen it done when it's a party of 2. The other thing that annoyed me was, as far as Im concerned, is tipping not something that's supposed to be at the discretion of the customer? Since when did the waiters and waitresses start deciding how good they are at their jobs?

I was VERY worried about what I'd find here, after reading some of the other reviews. Honestly, either I must have very low standards, or these other folks must be accustomed to places like the Fairmont, because this hotel is FINE. To be fair, there are a couple of minor issues. The good - Right on Michigan Avenue, directly across from Grant Park. Friendly staff (they happily loaned me an extension cord). Good rates for being in the city. Close to the museum complex, free shuttle there. WiFi for $3.95 per day. Clean, bright room (ok, so the decor is dated). Inexpensive guest laundry on site. Convenient restaurant with acceptable food. The bad - Beds are too short - not too small, too SHORT. I'm only 5'8\", and my feet hang over the end of the bed. Sleeping on a diagonal solves this. BTW, I've already cut myself on one of the protruding pieces of the bed frame - be careful! No comfortable chair in the room. 2 desk chairs and the beds. Not much around here by way of other restaurants, though there is a good blues joint just a block away. The neutral - Yes, the bathroom is rather small, but I am a very large man and have had no difficulties with the shower, as someone else implied.

The bottom 1/3 of this glass wall is windows with no screens or grates or any protection. The windows can be opened!!!! We had 2 rooms. In one room the windows handles were removed and the windows were bolted. In the other room, the handles were on the windows and one of them was not bolted. Our 3 year old son was able to open the window. We were on one of the top floors. This is very scary! Our shower was virtually a trickle, while the other room's (adjoining) was full blast.

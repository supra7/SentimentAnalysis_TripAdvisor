Turned on the light and it ran INTO THE BED. TERRIBLE HOTEL. Unsanitary rooms and awful customer service. When I called the front desk, they said there were no rooms to move me to and they would consider giving me a discount for the night. They expected me to stay in the room and acted as if there was nothing wrong. When I heard this, I walked down the hall and saw at least 3 rooms with their curtains open - EMPTY. I called back and they said that these rooms were on hold. I had to argue with them for 10 minutes before they agreed to move me.

Don't let the picture fool you, there is no lobby other than two small glass walkways, one leading to the check-in counter and the opposite door leading to a vending machine. You drive your car around to the door of the room you have booked. It is a motel that was slightly converted and has the Ramada name attached to it. The name Ramada suggests a nice place to stay, but this was seedy from the start. Although it is not in the shadiest part of town, it is not in the greatest looking area, either. There is a major highway leading into the city itself running outside of the hotel, but don't be fooled, there are plenty of sketchy characters who appear as though they are engaged in somewhat questionable activities mulling about in the area. Although the room appeared clean, the toilet looked to have what appeared to be drops of urine on the toilet seat although the bathroom smelled like bleach. We chose a non-smoking room, but the smell of smoke through the vent wafted in throughout the night. The cleaning staff spoke very little English, and although we tried very hard to be sympathetic, we spent about five minutes talking with the cleaning staff but not understanding or being able to communicate to each other. Finally, they left towels and moved on. We spent one night and were so skeeved out and generally disappointed that we left the next morning after our meeting even though we were scheduled for two more nights. Overall, the hotel left much to be desired. The uneasy feeling that we could not place that we had about the hotel is what caused us to find a Marriott and then shower until our skin peeled.

We were looking for clean hotel close to thier new home that was wallet friendly for one night. We have had good luck at Ramada hotels before and this one was $65 for a Friday night which is very resonable for a hotel room so we booked it. I always prefer to call the hotel directly. When I did I had a devil of a time understanding what the desk clerk on the phone was trying to tell me. He was not friendly and seemed some what irritated that I could not understand his very broken English. When we arrived to check in the transaction was done through bullet proof glass which was a first for us. Warning lights started to go off in my head. Again the check in clerk acted like he was bored and tired and just wated to get us out of his hair. I was ready to turn around and go someplace else; however, it was 10 PM so we were just hoped for a clean room to get some sleep. What we learned is that Ramada Limited is simply a \"motel\". We drove our car around to our room door. The door could only be opened by kicking it in. Once in the room we found it very clean but it had a bit of a funky smell. There wa no refridge. The bathroom was divided between two areas. One was not much bigger then a closet that contained the toilet and tub/shower. We laughed at how hard it was to attempt to close that door and attempt to dry after a shower......so we just left it opened. The shower was clean and worked well. The original toilet tank top I guess was broken because the current top was not the right size so you could see into the tank. My wife was able to connect to the wireless internet that the \"motel\" offered; however, the signal was very weak and would drop out at tmes so she gave up. There was the usual array of soaps, shampoos, and coffee pot all nicely arranged, The bed was very comfortable so we slept well. There is Bob Evan's and Arby's no more then a 5 minute walk away. Dispite the bullet proof glass the area in general looked fairly safe to me without any noise that we could hear over our air conditioner. Our AC although very noisy worked nicely. All and all if we again find ourselves in a situation where we must choose between a a Ramada limited or a motel we would stay at the motel and get what you pay for.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "OH", "Title": "\u201cIt's under my expectation\u201d", "Author": "Wayneness32", "ReviewID": "UR20736531", "Content": "Before I booked, I check a trip advisor which is shown great average, though other websites suggested not good place to stay.

Second, it has bad smell when entering a room. Actually this is because there is no openable windows. It just has big large window covered by a curtain. You can just slide a curtain but nothing you can handle the window. Third, you can use free internet, but it's too~~~ slow. TV is almost gone. I was surprised when turning on the TV. It had strange loud noise when I switched a channel. Iron board is toooo dirty. Fourth, breakfast is not good. It only provides some beverages, murpins, and cereals. Fifth, it's far from BWI and downtown and no suitable public transportation near there. I used a taxi to be there (cost over $40). Next day I tried to head for downtown.

We ordered \"Food to go\" from the menu in the room (from the restaurant in the hotel), which listed salmon at $14. When I went to pick it up, they charged $18 for it. When I told the restaurant employee that it was listed in the menu in the room for $14, he spoke to his manager and after a really long time, returned and told me that his manager said that I must be mistaken (the manager didn't even bother coming to talk to me). I then went all the way back to my room, retrieved the menu and brought it back to the restaurant to show them. After another long wait, the employee did the right thing, apologized and charged $14 for it, since his manager was too busy and the food was getting cold. In the morning, we awoke to an adjusted bill for $1 (yes, $1 only) for a service fee for the salmon. So not only did the restaurant try to overcharge me initially, and then I had to go back and forth to prove that the restaurant was charging more than the advertised price, but then someone went to the trouble of getting the hotel to administer a bill for $1 for a service fee. I think this was the restaurant manager's idea of an insult, and it's a terrible example of customer service. This was the worst, but other things that tripadvisor customers may be interested in is knowing that while there is a separate bedroom (separated by a door) to the living room, which is great for families, the pull-out couch in the living room is awful to sleep on and feels like sleeping on springs with no cushioning. Being near LAX is a plus, but the walls/ windows are poorly insulated and the noise from the airplanes is very loud. Finally, and perhaps this is standard in Hilton hotels, but when you arrive there are two bottles of water, a bag of pretzels and a couple of chocolate bars on the table. It is a wonderful surprise, but then there is also a page that is completely incomprehensible talking about Hilton Rewards points and that you need a certain amount of points in order to consume the food and water and it seems to indicate that if you eat the food and don't have the points you'll be charged, but it does not state it clearly. We didn't eat the food, but it was quite a disappointment to first see the goodies and then see that perhaps it was not complimentary. It seems like an underhanded ploy for the hotel to add charges to the room. In short, we probably won't be staying at this hotel or any Embassy Suites because of the awful experience with the hotel's restaurant and the hotel adding a charge after the restaurant greatly inconvenienced us.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal for a super-expensive city!\u201d", "Author": "eRev82", "ReviewID": "UR126336787", "Content": "Honestly, this is a great hotel for the value. \u00c2\u00a0The rooms are super spacious and modern -- especially for the airport strip.

Lovely to look at but someone was having a party in the lobby which carried up to the kids trying to sleep in the pull out couch in the living room. Us, parents in the bedroom got a great nights sleep behind heavy bedroom doors. 2. There were a bunch of pretzel crumbs in the pull out couch when we pulled it out. Weird...and annoying. 3.

It offers a fantastic two room suite - a proper suite - not a single room divided being called a \"suite\" as is so common these days. The room decor was exceptional with luxurious high quality fittings and latest specification flat screen TV's. The bed was outstanding with superior comfort and the room was way above average in cleanliness, even when I checked around the bed and around the edges - areas that rarely get cleaned in most hotels!! We also used the nice indoor heated pool to try to keep us awake and adjust us to LA time after our long flight from London. It's a very nice, decent sized clean pool with hot tub. By far the best aspect of this hotel is its superb staff. Nothing was too much trouble and the guy they had serving the fantastic FREE breakfast was great - cooked to order high quality food with a really positive attitude that we've rarely experienced in the US. Front desk staff were chatty and nice too. Official start time for breakfast was 6am weekdays - but we had to leave soon after that - and found that the breakfast was actually ready at 5:45am which helped! Now the bad points - AIRPORT NOISE and PARKING CHARGES. Even though we were on the side of the hotel the single glazed patio doors let in quite a bit of plane noise - so take earplugs like (I always do!) and you'll be fine. Not sure why LAX allows planes to take off and land at silly times of the night - but you can expect some level of sleep disturbance. If this is a problem - try the Springhill Suites at Hawthorne as that is about 3 miles south of the Airport - and although nowhere near the level of comfort of the Embassy Suites and a much smaller room size - the airport noise is pretty much non existent and the parking is free - rather than the ridiculous $21 the Embassy Suites charged! So, overall the Embassy Suites was a five star experience and a highly recommended LAX hotel - the best LAX hotel for the price in my opinion. So much so in fact that the next 3.5 star hotel we stayed at looked a bit tired in comparison. The management should take the breakfast guy who was serving on 20 Dec and give him employee of the month for starters!", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClose to LAX\u201d", "Author": "Niksia", "ReviewID": "UR121841725", "Content": "Rooms are spacious.

Based on previous TripAdvisor reviews, we requested a room on the side of the hotel away from the airport. The first room they gave us had a loud ventilation vibration coming from the walls. We were situated at the back of the hotel where the heating and cooling systems are and the noise traveled up. They moved us to the 7th floor and the noise was better, but still loud enough to be disturbing. They told us there were no other choices, so we decided to make the best of it. Bed is located by the sliding glass window and so light comes through the crack on to the bed in the morning. The motor in the heating system was making a noise and the engineer came up to fix it and said the entire motor needed replacing, and there was nothing that could be done that night. We slept without the system on, although the loud vibration from the exhaust systems was still a disturbance. At about 4 am the planes began taking off at regular intervals and they were loud enough to prevent us from getting back to sleep at 5 am. After tossing and turning until 7 am, I finally got up. The cocktail hour is really a rag tag sort of affair with cheap rot gut wine, popcorn and various bar nuts etc. If you are fan of warm cheese food on corn chips you can make a meal of it here. The free breakfast is only offered until 9 am and then the kitchen closes and you cannot get a real meal until 11, but forget breakfast of any sort. Not offered after 9. Although the rooms have been refurbished we found the black and brown decor heavy and unappealing as well as the heavily patterned carpets )also in black and brown). Atrium is full of uncomfortable furniture that reminds one of a high school cafeteria with tropical foliage.

The shiuttle from LAX may not be the most frequent but its a short ride to Airport Blvd. The interior of the hotel is a huge atrium with rooms facing in. It was something of an oasis from the bustle and general madness that is LAX. Rooms were, as you'd expect from Embassy, well appointed and comfortable. Ours had a mini balcony although the only thing to see outside was traffic. Soundproofing could have been better. I think I'd rather have had a fixed soundproofed window than one that opened onto the balcony. Hotel facilities were also good. There was a small indoor pool and a business suite with two PCs and free internet access. next to reception there was a 24 hour shop witha selection of drinks, snacks and last minute items. Drinks were also available from vending machines on each floor. The atrium was the location for the breakfast buffet. It looked really attractive for a relaxing breakfast although it was crowded and teh organisation of teh cooked to order items made service slower and more complicated than it needed to be. Overall it was disappointing but could be aesily improved. We returned the rental car before arriving. The car parking charges were rather high. In fact, if they'd been a bit lower I'd probably have stayed here for 3 days (instead we spent two days at the Raddison Residence Inn at Manhattan). Staff were helpful and efficient. Check in and out was quick. Overall, it was a nice place to relax before a flight home. So why won't I stay again? When I arrived home I found I'd been charged $5 for a bottle of water we hadn't used. mainly I was annoyed that they thought I was stupid enough to pay for an overpriced bottle of warm water when there was a refridgerated vending machine at teh end of the corridor that charged half that! I used the Hotel's online web form to advise them that the charge was incorrect and could they reconsider it - but didn't get an answer. I suppose I could have disputed the charge with Visa but, to be honest, life's too short to waste over a $5 overcharge.

This Embassy Suites hotel was no exception. The pool was slightly smaller than other Embassy Suites however the hotel was lovely as it has recently been renovated. The room in particular benefited from the renovation as I have stayed here before and after the renovation and the rooms now are extremely nice/modern. The fitness center was nice and empty both times I used it. Also, it has a key required to enter it which is excellent considering many wandering/unsupervised children tried to come in to play and since they didn't have a key it was great that my workout wasn't interrupted. Now for the CONS.... ---If you get a room facing Airport Blvd. it will be impossible for you to sleep! Not only do you hear the airplanes flying overhead (typical for all LAX hotels) but the road is so noisy and they must not have upgraded the windows when they renovated the rooms as the windows did not block out any noise ---The walls were also paper thin. Luckily the hotel was not fully booked when I was there and I was able to switch rooms to the quieter side (not facing Airport Blvd and instead facing a parking structure) and I was lucky that when I switched rooms that there wasn't anyone next to me ---75% of the hotel staff were extremely rude. The bellboy was extremely nice as was one front desk person. The rest were disgraceful. As a Hilton Honor Gold member I expected to at least be treated decently if not slightly better for my loyalty to Hilton and this was not the case here ---The free hotel to airport shuttle unfortunately proved that you get what you pay for. The shuttle is supposed to come every 15 minutes and as I was flying out mid-day on a Saturday I thought being down at the lobby ready to go 3 hours before my domestic flight would not be a problem however due to the undependable airport shuttle, I almost missed my flight. I waited 55 minutes for the shuttle that was supposed to come every 15 minutes. There was a shuttle that came however the driver would not let me and another passenger (there were 2 of us waiting) get on and told us we had to wait for the next one. When we explained our situation he was not empathetic and instead suggested that we try to get a taxi which I found to be extremely rude considering this was supposed to be a free service. (NOTE: The shuttle is not just for the Embassy Suites but is a shared service with other hotels in the area) and this driver, although there was room, had a bee in his bonnet and would not let us on even though there was room for both us and our luggage. When the 2 of us complained to the hotel they said they would send a private shuttle for the 2 of us however that private shuttle never came (or maybe it did but finally the normal shuttle did arrive which we were able to get on albeit 55 minutes later) ---As Hilton Honors Gold, I had free Internet however if you aren't Hilton Honors Gold you have to pay for Internet ---Parking is extremely expensive ($21 + tax) even for visitors. I wanted a friend to visit me and even for her to park for 1 hour it was going to cost a lot ---There was a loud party going on in the hotel and despite their \"anti-party policy\" it took them quite a while to break it up. As a woman staying alone on this occasion, I did not feel safe with the drunk men from that party leering at me as I walked back to my hotel room after dinner... Overall, if you want to stay at an Embassy Suite, the one South of the Airport is much better. If you want to stay at a hotel near LAX then I'd choose another one not this one unless you get a great cheap deal, are guaranteed you don't get a room along Airport Blvd. and either their shuttle service improves or you just take a taxi to save you headache.

Rooms are large and updated. Rate I paid was very reasonable by LAX Airport standards. Check-in was quick, friendly and efficient. Breakfast was complimentary and had 2-3 hot items to go along with the basic cold breakfast items. SMALL CONS: Room smelled somewhat strange...almost like a brand new room smell? Coffee maker didn't work but someone came to fix it within 20 minutes. The vent in the ceiling right before you enter the bedroom was coming off and could possibly fall on a person's head if not screwed in eventually. Hairdryer did not work but I didn't complain to the front desk since I didn't really need it. The lamp light by the bed worked, but the outlet right beneath the bed did not work when I went to plug my phone charger...also didn't complain about this since there were plenty of other outlets in the room. BIG CON: At breakfast time, the guy cooking the omelets put two $1 bills on the counter so guest would assume that a tip was necessary. I saw at least 3 other guests put $1 bills on the counter and it looked rather tacky with all these $1 bills spread all over the place. Normally, you should put a tip jar or a tip plate on the side of the counter, but this guy placed the two $1 bills right smack in the middle of the front counter. I don't have a problem tipping (I tipped the HK before I checked out), but his procedure was rather unnecessary and kind of put me off. Makes you wonder whether a guest is suppose to pay or what happens if you don't tip considering the breakfast is complimentary? Perhaps management might want to research this matter because at the other 3 to 3 1/2 star hotels I stay at, they don't allow employees to do this because again, it's rather tacky..", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent base near airport, good value and service\u201d", "Author": "RestfulLondon", "ReviewID": "UR107372879", "Content": "Great base for 3 days near airport after long transatlantic flight.

As a Hilton Honors member, this clearly was the worst example of a hotel room I've ever stayed in under the Hilton name. Check-in was fast and pleasant, and the clerk was kind and helpful. Upon getting up to the room, things went down hill from there. The entry into the room was interesting because the entry door had a mechanism for shutting the door very fast and quickly. I've never seen a door shut with such vigor and a slamming noise; good thing I didn't have any kids with me because they might have been injured. The sitting room looked worn and uninviting. I felt that I had walked into someone's old apartment. While the room didn't smell or have odors, just the appearance alone might make you think you were in a 1.5 to 2 star property. Coffee maker worked well. Now, onto the bedroom area. There was a huge dresser wall unit with a huge mirror with a table below for either a television or for working.

The bed was actually comfortable and the linens were clean and starchy feeling. The bathroom was adequate but had wallpaper that was probably around at the time of the Mod Squad television show production during the 70s. Water pressure was good and there was an adequate supply of towels. The bathroom was the only area of the room that was well-lit but it was stark and uninviting. Reminded more of nice motel along route 66. The balcony faced another building so there was no view. I can't criticize the hotel for this because it was night and there was nothing to look at anyway. I'm sure management tells the desk clerks to put late check-in guests in these rooms because they would have no need to look out the window/sliding door.

The front desk were decent and the room was fine. We then proceeded to the 'Managers Reception' which was disappointing because free drinks meant poorly made drinks.,although the bartender was sweet. We asked a young waitress in the courtyard for a pepperoni pizza,an hour went by and no pizza,so we approached the waitress again (who had to pulled away from her cellphone)..only to be told we HAD NOT placed any such order with her. The Bartender placed the order and made a gin martini for my husband that was warm and had far too much vermouth,and if she had bothered to ask,my husband has a fondest for bombay sapphire gin....we decided to take the pizza to go.... we then lose our bartender to a 20 minute \"crude\" spanish conversation with 2 other employees and a cook...we are caucasians who understand spanish! ...this was unpleasant. I had ordered a chocolate martini ..it never came. The next day after a long day sight seeing and waiting for friends to arrive from LAX...We decided to call room service and no one answered...so we are forced to venture back into the restaurant. The phone is ringing of the hook...2 employees stand by the entrance telling us to sit anywhere....a new bartender is swamped with customers and asks for someone to answer the phone...she is frustrated and tells us she will be right back... the gentleman beside me, informs us he is a regular and this bartenders drinks are worth the wait..and although we waited a while ...we couldnt help but feel for this poor girl...who was run off her feet.. while others stood around...her 'wish i was an octopuss comment had us all laughing'... when we asked for a chocolate martini ...she offered me 4 different kinds..but insisted I try her ultimate chocolate martini..Which was so delicious I had 2!!.. My husbands gin martini was perfect..it was shaken so well it had shreds of ice forming on the top..and made with bombay sapphire. Our party arrives and we proceed to a table where a wonderful waiter called Jack took great care of us and helped us forget the evening before. The Rainbow trout was so good and our friends enjoyed the pasta dishes...the mahi mahi wasnt so enjoyable and the food took too long. Also the bickering amongst the staff and lack of teamwork really lets this restaurant down. Not ONCE did I ever see a manager and it seems that job is also left for the poor bartender to do. Around 10pm that evening my husband informs me he has lost his wallet, full of credit card and cash as we had just cashed a travellers note that day.. we search the restaurant...then the room...we called the restaurant and the woman on the other end tells us to call a manager tomorrow. By 11pm we are frantic...we call the restaurant one last time and the Bartender answers..she tells us she will look for it and call us back... 11.20 pm there is a knock on the door..it is the bartender holding our wallet. .we are amazed to find that not a dime is missing... we are so moved by her honesty that my husband tries to give her 100 dollars...she thanks us ..but refuses to except the money, I dont remember her name..shes a New Zealand girl and I wanted to share this experience with the hotel and other people like ourselves you value this kind of service . and the best chocolate martini you will ever taste..

On arrival (8.30am) we were greeted by a helpful and friendly staff member who allowed us to check in to our room immediately, without any extra charge. The hotels decor is a bit tired and dated, but the rooms are very spacious and clean. The King bed suite has a large bathroom and an extra vanity in the bedroom, also a sitting area with small kitchenette (microwave, fridge, sink and coffee maker). Only problem I'm a tea drinker, no jug meant I had to use microwave to heat the water. Our room faced away from the airport and was very quiet.The bed was very comfortable. After freshening up we were ready to see some sights.We had heard about the Ocean Express bus (from a tripadvisor review) that goes to Manhattan Beach and 2 upmarket shopping centres which picks up from Century Blvd. We asked at reception and bought the tickets from there. Very cheap ($5) for round trip, get on and off all day/night. Manhattan beach is lovely, much nicer than up the coast (Venice, Santa Monica). At the hotel between 5.30-7.30pm there is the Manager's reception. This is a great way to relax after a day out, with free drinks and nibbles. We ate at the restaurant for dinner both nights as it was very reasonable and convenient. The buffet breakfast was good with everything you could want. We opted to go to Universal Studios on the 2nd day on our own. We caught the free shuttle back to the airport and then got on the FlyWay bus to Union Station ($7) then got the metro to Universal City ($1.50), then caught the free bus up the hill to Universal Studios. This was so cheap and easy to do and a bit of an experience, instead of sitting on a tour bus for hours, stopping at each hotel.

The breakfast is served in the same area and was amazing with made to order omelets (my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e had mushrooms), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, hash browns, fruit and plenty of other great foods. I used the hot tub and thought it was amazing. The pool area is very nice and well taken care of. There was some sort of Halloween event going on during our stay that got a little annoying around 9PM. The area around the pool entrance was packed and it was quite the challenge getting the door open at the pool entrance. Keep in mind; I was in a swimsuit so it was a little uncomfortable being around so many people. The event seemed like it was never going to end, luckily it did, but it was inconvenient to say the least. I know people celebrate Halloween, but when we check in at 4PM and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still going at 10PM, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit much. It would have been better if the line to get in wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t by the pool. This is not a common thing and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting it to be as noisy as it was. Hopefully, they control it better next year. While the party was a minor issue for me, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying $100+ to stay at a hotel, you should be able to enjoy the hotel and its amenities (like the pool) without any problems. We used the business center to check into our flight the next day and it was nice, quiet, and free. The internet use is limited to a certain time (for obvious reasons) and can only be used for certain websites (like email).

She checkedand said that she had nothing ready and if we wanted to we could just leave our luggage with the bellman and go do something for the night and check in later. I told her my 2 year old will need a nap so I will wait till 3 and check in at that time so she could have a nap and we could then do something. she said okay.

I am a little suspicous now. I got a two room suite through the Embassy suites website at a great rate of $89 a night and I think there were specific rooms they were going to stick me in. So I tell the guy all of this and tell him that I want to cancel my reservation now and all of sudden we have our room. The room was a beautiful 2 room suite and this kind of backs up what I was thinking. The other problem was that there was a wedding reception the first night we were there and there was no parking that we paid for in the parking garage. We had to park in a garage next door that was not ev en theirs. I thought it was pretty bad that would take my $20 a night to park for the garage and not guarantee me a spot.

We were two families traveling together with kids age 7-14. This hotel was our last stop before an early morning flight out of LAX. The check in process was smooth. The husbands went to return the cars while the kids and wifes checking into our rooms. The Lourdes, was extremely nice and helpful at check in. We were given rooms on two different floors as they were sold out for the night and couldn't get the two families close together. That was fine. When we got the luggage to the room I opened the door and woof, the smell of smoke was over powering. I called to the front desk and Lourdes moved me to the 8th floor. That room was smoke free. Throughout our stay we thouroughly checked our rooms for bedbugs before we brought our luggage in/unpacked. We looked at the mattresses and boxsprings and head boards. Both the mattress and box spring looked ok. The headboard was covered in a huge layer of dust on the back side. No bugs, no eggs, no casings, so we moved in. I got a call from my cousin in the other room to come see her mattress. It had a huge blood stain in the center of the mattress that the housekeepers had tried to clean but was still there and three pin dots of blood close to the edge of the mattress. We called the manager. He said the house keepers inspected the mattresses each time they clean a room and he didn't think this looked like a bedbug stain. (google bedbugs stains and they can look like pin dots of blood). My cousin wanted to move her room and they said they were sold out and couldn't move her. I said can't she go to the smoky room I just left? Yes, she could. She moved and opened the sliders. The smell was concentrated in the living room portion of the room, so they slept only in the bed room not on the couch. But this required she sleep with her two daughters (3 in a bed). Not a good night sleep. We ate in the hotel restaurant, service was painfully slow at 9pm with not many folks in the dining room. We decided the waiter must be cooking too. Food was ok, not bad, but I think we waited more than 35 minutes for the food to come out. We woke up at 4:30 showered and began to get dressed. I carried the hair dryer out of the bathroom to the additional sink outide the bathroom, turned on the overhead light and ..bed bug was crawling across the sink. I killed it and called the front desk. When we checked out I brought it to him in a plastic bag. He didn't seem too concerned, but proceeded to tell me about how his own house had just been treated for bedbugs and it was like something out of a horror movie. I asked that the hotel manager call me. Two days later I hadn't received a call and left another message. I called the next day again and spoke to the guest services manager who had been out sick and just returned back. Their response was they had an exterminator check the room and didn't see anything. Bed bugs can hide in box springs, wood furinture (there was a huge amoire in the room the would have been impossible to move and look behind as it was a builtin piece of cabinetry.) The guest services manager was supposed to call us back again and never did. If we hadn't seen the blood pin stains on the other mattress I might have assumed this the only one in the hotel. But the reaction from the morning desk clerk and the lack of response from management makes me think that this was not the only bug they ever had.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, Friendly...but Noisy!\u201d", "Author": "Mom2Boys", "ReviewID": "UR78123103", "Content": "OK...it's a hotel by an airport so what should I have expected? Later at night, there was a constant deep droning noise. Not quite sure if it was from the airport or from inside the building but that was almost more distracting than the airplanes taking off throughout the night (it was quieter at 8 am than it was at 1 am!), Thank goodness for Tylenol PM and that my son is a DJ and had extra sets of heavy-duty earplugs with him! The staff was wonderful and very, very friendly. Parking was an issue when the hotel was booked on the weekends so they adjusted the parking fee off our bill. There are parking spots within the property gates along the perimeter of the hotel where you can park before going down into the garage - not as convenient, but better than parking on the street or in another lot where they offered to cover the charge (although the neighboring lots are less expensive). The facility is fine, although showing signs of age. The blanket on the sleeper sofa in the living area was scuzzy, but the bedding in the bedroom was fine and those beds were comfortable. I tried sleeping on the sleeper sofa to get away from the noise from the outside, but it was too uncomfortable for me. We thought this location was going to be ideal due to the proximity to all the major roads, however, we had never experienced the LA freeways before! By the end of our trip, we were taking the city streets everywhere and avoiding the freeways! The majority of our sightseeing was north of the city (Hollywood, Burbank) so we should have stayed up in that area even if the hotels were more expensive. It was at least a 45 minute drive every morning due to traffic. There is a hefty charge for accessing the wifi in your room, however, you can use the computers and printer in the business center at no charge (not well-advertised). Breakfast is nice, but they clean up and close up right at 9 am on weekdays (not ideal if you have gotten in late the night before and want to sleep in a bit) and 10:30 on weekends. So for our family needs, this hotel was not the best choice. Spacious rooms, but didn't sleep well, difficult parking and too far from the sightseeing spots due to the traffic.

That is so rare in todays business environment when many act as if they are doing you a favor when you are spending your hard earned money at their venue. Believe me, we had other choices but her favorable business attitude is what won us over. Our event is still spoken of several months later by the 200 guests that attended. Katherine (and apparently her staff) made sure our ball room was decorated beautifully, they were flexible in terms of the time that the food was served, she offered great advice... I could go on and on. We had a \"free\" nights stay with our event and the next morning as a guest of the hotel you are welcome to the \"free\" breakfast buffet which was vast & tasty. The chef who made the omelets was also nice to work with. I forget his name but I think it had a latin flavor, he is tall and bald.

I have been booking hotel rooms for over twenty-five years and have never ran into the issue I had with Embassy Suites LAX North. I booked a room on May 18th for a stay on July 31st. I reserved an e-mail confirmation that my Room type was Non-Smoking Confirmed King bed with a preference for Non-Smoking two beds. The day before our stay I phoned the hotel because I saw on line that rooms with two queen beds were available. I was told by the person that I spoke to in reservations that I was changed to two queen beds Non-Smoking and was sent a new e-mail confirmation with the same confirmation number. Meaning the non-smoking confirmed was still part of the reservation. Upon arrival at the hotel I checked in and when we went to our assigned room found out it was a smoking king room. I spoke to the gentleman at the front desk about this and showed him my e-mail confirmation. He pointed out on the e-mail a sentence that read the following. Your room type preferences have been submitted with your reservation and are subject to hotel availability. He was very professional and gave me a discount on my room. I did not have a problem with the king bed since that is what I had originally booked. But I had a non smoking confirmed room according to my e-mail. In my dictionary the word confirmed means not subject to change. Obviously whoever oversees the running of this hotel does not know the meaning of the word or what is typed in the e-mails that are sent. In addition to being assigned a smoking room, the sleeper sofa frame was broken and the mattress partially fell through making it feel like you were camping on a hill.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite on the 6th floor. The hotel is very convenient to LAX about 1 mile away and easily accessible with their own efficient shuttle service from the terminal area that runs back and forth about every 15min. We selected this hotel based our other TripAdvisor feedback again and found when searching for lodging near the airport that there really never seems to be a perfect hotel within striking distance of LAX but this one had enough positive reviews for me to roll the dice. Check in was interesting in that I secured a room at $183/night and was checked in and upon entering our room found my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grandmother waiting in the living room of our room as she was going to be staying with us, and I was a little perplexed because I was wondering how she had access to the room considering I just checked in. Basically she checked into the room and they checked me in over the top of her check in on the same room which I had sole reservations for. Go figure but it worked out in the end. Outside the room areas are showing a little wear and could use a fresh coat of paint. Inside the room, we had 2 queen beds in back bedroom and we ordered a crib in that room for our 2 yr old. In the front room you have a table with chairs, side chair and a pull out bed couch. This area also holds the fridge and microwave which I prefer vs. being squired away and unavailable when someone is in the sleeping area, namely our 2 yr old. The bathroom is only accessible to the back bedroom which I think was an issue when you sharing with family cohabitating both back and front areas. Why no one figured out an easy solution such as a dual entry door to the bath is beyond me and my one major knock on the hotel. Our crew went down to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moderately priced restaurant Aero Bistro for a quick dinner. I had the BBQ chicken pizza and my wife the Mahi Mahi dish. Both were excellent, even the presentation of the dishes were more in line with an upper scale restaurant. The staff was attentive and interactive which made for a pleasant meal. Now the best part - after a 4 hr flight with a 2 yr old I was very happy to participate in the complementary manager happy hour that runs from 530pm-730pm. The drinks are not watered down and after 5 of them I was able to unwind from that flight. The staff hosting the festivities were very friendly and wanting to make sure all your needs were met. They kept running nachos and popcorn over to our table and were happy in the process. We also enjoyed the complementary full breakfast buffet the next morning before our flight to Mexico. Basically I think it is priced a little high but given what is included and what we took advantage of during our stay it turned into a fair value.

Bacon and sausage were not displayed as part of the buffet, but if you go and order eggs, you will be asked whether you want them. The rest of the buffet was the usual run-of-the-mill. If you want fresh hash browns, wait until you get your eggs. Don't go to the egg station with a plate that has food on it, you'll end up getting less bacon and sausage :) Happy hour at the hotel: 530-730pm.

We were sat on a sofa in an area right alongside the atrium, and he comes to tell us that we are not to spill anything there so as not to make more work for him. It was just bizarre. On a different day, and a different attendant, I overheard this guy scolding some children who were handling popcorn. In any case, the happy hour items did not change from day-to-day. Expect nachos, popcorn, trailmix, sodas other than the open bar. The room was roomy and comfortable, particularly the bed. We slept well. The proximity to LAX didn't deter us from rest. There was one flat screen TV in the main living area and one older model in the bedroom. Reception was not great but that was not as important to us. The bathroom could use some better planning. The bathtub was far from where the towels were. The floor will get wet before you get to your towel. In fact, my child did slip and fall in there. Be warned! My husband liked the fact that there was an additional sink in the bedroom. Also appreciated was the fridge/freezer in the room, and yet another sink at the 'bar' area. The airport shuttle came every 15-20 mins so I would say that was very convenient. The pool and fitness area were also good. We more than likely will stay here again even if we were briefly bothered by a few quirky things. The location is a winner. Parking here is a cinch.

We always select an Embassy Suites when traveling as it guarantees a safe and clean environment - NOT THIS TIME! This property offers shuttle service to and from LAX airport which is convenient. Although we are Hilton Honor Members and reserved and pre-paid in full early Dec 2008, they did not have the King room requested available and offered a double arrangement. Their excuse: late arrival. Never heard of this before at this type of establishment. Staff was not rude and attempted to accomodate us. Strangely a King suite was found and keys were issued. Upon arrival to our room 522, we discovered it was a special assistance suite in addition to a connecting room. We were so tired we decided not to discuss the issue with the staff but would deal with Hilton upon our return. The room was a two-suite as expected but the furniture, carpet, lamps, etc appeared to be 30 years old - old and dirty - disgustinly dirty! Surely not of Hilton standard. Electrical wires in the bedroom entertainment center were exposed. Drapes were in need of repair or better yet, complete replacement. The bathroom had filth on the walls - don't know what that brown stain was on the door. Ceiling above shower showed a shotty plastering job - yellow, bulging and disgusting. The sink and tub leaked all night! Needless to say, we did not use the shower but waited to shower onboard our ship instead. The property is in a rundown - or at least looks like- area. Four Points is across the street and from the outside looks in the same condition. THe next morning we attempted breakfast - served from 6am-9:30am. This was good.

I am very disappointed to say that this is the first time we had a terrible stay. Check-in was fine, and since this was a one night stay before an early flight the next morning, we opted for a cheaper, \"non-suite\" room. It was oddly placed in the far back corner on one of the floors, and it looked like it was put there as an afterthought, across from a noisy janitor closet/utility area. Although the hotel is non-smoking, the room smelled like a smoker stayed there and took liberties breaking the rules, so we called the front desk and they moved us to another room and gave us a free upgrade to a suite. In the second room, the floors were a bit dirty, but we thought we could endure given the short duration of the stay until we went into the bathroom: there was a large hole in the wall where someone kicked or punched it in, and the tub was *disgusting*. It had little black dots all over it, like someone had spilled a bag of charcoal and didn't clean it up. We were so grossed out we immediately called the front desk and moved to another room. It too wasn't terribly clean but it was adequate enough to stay put as we were tired of shuffling around at that point (after 9:30pm). All three rooms and the hotel in general are in sore need of updating. Bathroom fixtures were rusted and loose, the carpets were very old and tired, and the pickled oak furniture was outdated and beaten up. The sitting room in the third room we were put in didn't have a coffee table, while there was one in the second room, and the sofas and chairs had seen much better days. The elevators were dirty - someone had spilled food and it wasn't cleaned, at least as long as we were there. I have to admit that I didn't sleep well, worrying half the night that I would get bedbugs or worse from that room! I will give credit where it's due, the staff was friendly and the restaurant and waiter were quite good. But we noticed that the clientele was... how can I put this nicely... were very loud, noisy, no control over kids - more of the 1-2 star hotel guest variety - and that was shocking as all the Embassy Suites we've stayed in were quiet and catered to more polite, quiet, business or well-behaved family types. Staff made no attempt to remind guests to control themselves or their kids, and the pool area was overrun and the business center was full of pre-teens surfing the web. Considering how many hotels there are in the LAX vicinity, this Embassy Suites really needs to get its act together, renovate, and clean up in order to keep up with its namesake brand and retain customer loyalty.

Since everyone seems to know the attraction of the ES, there is no need to elaborate. Suffice to say, we were a bit apprehensive given two extremely negative reviews about servivce, maintenance, upkeep. In fact, I wrote a general letter of concern to Embassy Suites and was amazed, a few days later, that Mr. Lester, assistant general manager to this property, replied! He had read the complaints and would do everything possible to improve on the situation. What professionalism! And he kept his word. I should point out that we were not given any priority treatment or any kind of bonus. We were treated with the respect that any client should receive. That began at check-in and ended at check-out. All questions were answered accurately and courteously. Our transfers to and from LAX were also handled professionally. Our rooms were the standard two-room suite configuration and were clean and quiet. Even so, we always bring along earplugs just in case of unwanted noise later. The drinks at Happy Hour were well made and poured and the nachos, chips and dip, popcorn sufficient finger food. I like the atrium's appearance and the sufficient number of tables, even on a busy afternoon. Tables and the area were kept clean. At breakfast, omelets were made to order, although there were no sausages as might be found at other properties. No problem with that. There was also plenty of fresh fruit, juice, coffee, cereal, breads. There was never any problem with noise. The only problems we encountered--and I have subsequently notified Mr. Lester of this--was the absence of items on the menu for dinner at the Century Cafe restaurant. For example, there was no fish for the fish tacos, although by asking for ahi (tuna) to be substituted, one could get this dish. But the service was excellent and reflected careful attention to details. We still enjoyed ourselves quite well. One of the things Mr. Lester asked us to do when staying here was to keep an open mind and judge for ourselves the level of quality. Thank you, sir, for that advice. We should all apply that when staying at any lodging. I also recommend that anyone viewing a slue of negative reviews write the management.

We had to stay for 2 nights to visit family in LA before boarding a cruise ship in San Pedro (port of los angeles). We were travelling with 2 teenage children so wanted the two room suite and breakfast buffet option. We got a rate of 125.00 for first night and 139.00 for second night through AAA which I thought was good for the amount of space. 2 queen beds and 1 pull out couch. We arrived at 11 pm and found the hotel shuttle right outside from the baggage carousel. Make sure you are getting on the Embassy suites LAX NORTH shuttle as there is another embassy suites LAX South which is confusing. The shuttle we took also serviced the Marriott which I found odd but perhaps it was the late evening arrival. Even with a stop at the Marriott first it only took 5 to 7 minutes to be delivered right to the front door of the hotel. Check in was very easy but we had missed the food room service hours and they did not serve any food at the restaurant or room service after 11 pm. I thought I had read that they had 24 hour room service so my hubby was not happy. they did have a little market and he bought some really gross burritos and even grosser cheese pizzas for the kids to microwave in the room -- $38.00 dollars worth to be exact. We were on the second floor which was pretty easy but now about the room. Just know that the first impression of the room was really not good and I was wanting to ask for another room but as mentioned above I had a very hungry and tired family who had been fllying for 8 hours and were still dealing with the time change which made it like 4 am so we settled for what we were given. The rug was musty smelling and there was a 24 inch diameter red stain on the rug in the bedroom. The tub in the bathroom looked oldish and scratched and never looked as though it had been cleaned. Just tired and old finish I think. The linens and beds were clean and exceptionally comfortable. The rooms and the bathroom were very spacious and the balcony was huge although there were sandbags at the slider (this may account for the musty/damp smell) and no chairs out on the balcony. There wasn't much reason to sit outside but a chair would be nice. The kitchenette area had a small fridge, tiny microwave and coffeemaker. and small stainless sink. There was a table and chairs for 4 for dining, however, there were no utensils or silverware. They did provide papertowels so we used it for plates to serve the gross pizza. We stayed on a Saturday night and we now realize there must have been a wedding or function earlier on Saturday because the party noise continued all and I mean ALL night long. We did not hear any noise from the street or the airport/planes but the walls were paper thin. There was a bunch of girls next door who stayed up all night long laughing and singing and Banging the doors shut. This is how thin the walls are -- everytime someone would close/bang the door shut next door, our headboard would shutter and shake with so much movement as to wake you up even if you had somehow managed to doze off a bit. Again we were so exhausted that we did not want to move our room and just put up with it. To tell the truth we were also a bit intimidated by the numbers of partyers and did not want to antagonize any drunks. The next morning there was trash everywhere in front of our room with dirty cups/glasses. The breakfast made up for a lot. It was huge with lots of choices and lots of fruit, pastries, eggs, sausage and a made to order omelette station. We rented a car for the day from Budget which is directly across the street. That was really handy to just leave the car off and run across the street the same night. We needed a ride out to the cruise ship pier and the girl at the front desk was very helpful. We used Super Shuttle and were able to get picked up right from the hotel and taken directly by van to the San Pedro pier. $69.00 for 4 people with all our luggage. We were told that a cab could run at least 80 before tip so the Super Shuttle was great. We also reserved them to pick us up at the dock on the ship's return and that was $68.00 for 4 and very efficient. OK back to the hotel -- overall the hotel was a little on the shabby side not what you'd expect from the Hilton chain but the location was excellent, the breakfast buffett was excellent , the pool area was clean and nice, and oh yes the boys had dinner in the century restaurant down stairs and the food was very good and fair priced for hotel food, and the rooms and bathroom were spacious. If you can get the right price this place is really not a bad choice especially if you need the space. Almost forgot -- the wifi was $9.95 for 24 hours. We had trouble getting the wi ficonnection to work and had to call GTS ourselves which was a pain. If I had been there for business I would have been quite annoyed.

Mr HILTON Please put a notice panelled above the front desk and saying : SMILING DOESN'T CAUSE ANY HEAVY DESEASE, Please do train your desk staff and improve deeply their customer service ability, Do it for your new clients, because as far as we are concerned, we shall NEVER come back again in this Hotel!", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "somerset, uk", "Title": "\u201cvery nice\u201d", "Author": "turtleholidaycat", "ReviewID": "UR10048988", "Content": "we chose to stay at embassy suites for our first night after flying to los angeles as it was very close to the hertz rental site.

Frankly, there was nothing remarkable about the room. It wasn't the lap of luxury, but it wasn't a dump either. If you've stayed at Embassy Suites before, there'll be no surprises. Our one complaint was the smell in the room. It was rather musty. And no matter how high or low we adjusted the thermostat, the room just recycled air without heating or cooling it. Our departing flight left so early that we missed the breakfast, so I can't comment on the food. Would I return to this hotel when staying at LAX? Probably not.

The hotel has a really good hot breakfast buffet that is included in the room price. If you have an early flight before the buffet starts, you can request a breakfast to go the night before- but you have to ask for the breakfast- one hotel clerk knew nothing about it. The \"togo\" breakfast was fruit, a muffin and granola bar.There is a free hourly trolley shuttle one block away that I took to Manhattan beach- it is about a 20 min ride. I also saw that there is a public bus near the hotel that goes to Santa Monica but I did not take that bus.

As it turned out I lost time looking for a space in the hotel garage before being directed to the overflow garage. Unfortunately the overflow garage was fenced in. This made it difficult to find an exit for my young children (4 and 6 year-old) and me to walk through with our luggage. We then had to walk through a poorly lit alley behind the hotel to reach the front lobby. I would not have agreed to this for my family if I had known ahead of time. I did not feel safe. It would not have been as much of an issue for me as a single person. Although I received \"complimentary\" parking, a member of management was not on site to provide me with any further compensation.

No doubt about it. But something is missing in the service department. The physical structure of the place is warm and inviting. My first reaction to seeing our room was that heaven must have had a sale on fabrics. From the linens to the drapes to the towels, there are plush fabrics everywhere. As result, the hotel is warm and comfortable and rather quiet given its location. And, for a hotel stay in the dead of a Boston winter, there probably is not a warmer or warmer feeling hotel in town. However, the warmth ends with the structure of the hotel. The front desk service is tops. However, the bar staff, cleaning crews, and restaurant staff just seem mildly indifferent. It's as though the hotel has \"done enough\" to compete as a luxury hotel and the staff lacks the incentive to do more. And for the prices commanded by the Eliot (basic rooms starting at $350-450/night), the hotel should reflect a stronger commitment to serving its customers. * Requests for additional pillows for the room required a couple of calls to the front desk (I offered to go down to the front desk myself but was assured the staff would handle it), and they were delivered an hour later. * When we visited the bar (each evening over a 4-night stay), the bar staff were, well, just tepid. Simply not engaged with us or any other customer that entered the bar. I've worked in the hospitality/food service industry for years. Yes, when staff is busy, no one should expect endless, buoyant conversation. But we did not see the bar staff doing much of anything. Perhaps there is a management issue that translates into a lack of morale with the staff. Just a guess. Yes, the Eliot is a contender for greatness. The look, feel, location, and pricing of the hotel put the Eliot in top tier range. And I am rooting for the Eliot to succeed! It has almost everything it needs to be one of the finest hotels. But the service needs to improve. A good hotel stay is more than bricks, motor, and, in this case, fabric. A worthwhile customer experience in a hotel requires consistent, friendly service. The current lack of good customer service is what makes the Eliot a good, not great, hotel.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful decor and location with some room for improvement in service\u201d", "Author": "Travelingbiz", "ReviewID": "UR126282543", "Content": "This was my second stay at the Eliot. I love the location and the suites contain a bedroom and a sitting room. The bathroom is nice and I appreciated having a nice big shower. Although there are many different areas in the room, the room appears a bit cramped and the layout for power sockets could be improved. The staff is a bit of a mixed bag. Some are very friendly and go out of the way to help you and others look at you as if you have asked them an incident question. I had breakfast in the Clio once and the waitress really struggled to take the order and fulfil them. Overall service is variable. I would not suggest buying the internet package of the hotel which I did. I paid for two days but could not access the internet through the AT&T connection. Instead I used a free Boston-based service. This was however slow. Charing $10 for internet that does not work is not really impressive. I would stay there again due to the service and the overall boutique style of the hotel. I also like the fact that it is family-owned.

We had a double double suite that was a reasonable size for a boutique hotel in Boston (which means it was a bit small). The decorating is quite lovely if you are into VERY traditional Americana. Unfortunately, the television and electronics are about the same vintage - a bit disappointing after spending a day traveling. The valet parking was painless. The restaurant, on the other hand, was a big mistake. We ate there for breakfast - painfully slow service, mediocre food, and dreadfully high prices. I did complain about the service at the front desk upon departure. Got a simple, \"Thank you,\" but nothing else.

We had no problems with outlets as others have written. Our bathroom had a shower only which was fine for us. The bathroom is kind of a one person at a time place but easily forgivable given the spaciousness of the suite in general. I did have to put a couple of towels on the floor because of water leaking out the glass shower door. The corner room had windows facing the streets but traffic noise wasn't really noticeable. The T stop was a few minutes walk (Hynes Convention Center). Lots of stores and restaurants within walking distance. The hotel provided a marked walking/running trail around the area with distances noted. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurants. We also did not have a car. All staff members were courteous and appropriately attentive. I would really have liked to have had a small coffee maker. Thankfully there was a Starbucks a short walk away.

The room we stayed in (a premier suite king) was spacious and comfortable. The staff were all very attentive and polite. Even the free shoe shine was wonderful: you hang your shoes on the doorknob in a bag they provide before you go to bed and you wake up to find your shoes looking better than they have in years. My wife and I did the \"Winter in the City\" deal which provided free parking (a must in the Back Bay area of Boston) and a free breakfast in Clio. I'd highly recommend a breakfast package because for the cost of tax and tip, we had a complimentary $20 per person buffet with fresh fruit and some very delicious baked goods (if you want bacon or eggs and order a la carte, say goodbye to your wallet). The only cons are that the dresser was pretty small and probably could not accomodate 2 people if we stayed for several nights. Also, the shower is bizarre with a partition which only covers half the shower, so you feel like at any minute you'll flood the bathroom. I can't understand why they wouldn't have some kind of sliding door, if only to keep you from getting cold in the shower. But these are small items. Overall the Eliot is a really great hotel. You'll pay $300+ per night because of where you are in Boston, but you will get your money's worth.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel... just lacked a few nice touches\u201d", "Author": "AbsolutelyNoBorders", "ReviewID": "UR125612052", "Content": "We stayed at the Eliot Hotel for our recent Wedding Anniversary and overall it was a great choice for us. The location can't be beat (walking distance from Newbury Street, public transport and anything else you might want) and the Hotel itself is consistently and deservedly voted to be Boston's best. We opted for the 'Touch of Paris' package which includes a large King Suite, dinner at their French restaurant - Clio - and buffet breakfast as well. The price is very competitive (only a small increase from what you would pay for just the room alone) so it is a very good deal. We loved loved loved the dinner at Clio... we've eaten at many of Boston's \"best\" restaurants and Clio is by far the best dining experience we've had in Boston ever. Every course was delicious and well presented and the service was amazing. This coupled with the beautiful Parisian furnishing of the room was worth what we paid and we would unequivocally recommend this hotel and package to anyone we talk to. On the flip side there were a couple of (admittedly small) things that could have improved our stay and would have been the difference between a 4 and a 5 star review here. The ROOM amenities. Although they advertize that the rooms associated with this package have a bath tub, ours didn't (the fine print does say actual room may vary slightly) but when the bold print says \"bath tub,' one would assume a tub will be in the bathroom, instead of just a small shower and sink. Also as we got ready to go out for dinner we noticed more and more things missing from the room... firstly there was no Iron and they had to bring one up... then we realized the shaving kit didn't have everything you need to shave... then we had to call front desk again because the hair dryer is very low quality and kept cutting out... three trips up from the (very helpful) front desk staff could all have been avoided if the room was fully stocked with high quality appliances and amenities as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. The other negative was the BREAKFAST. The package value is really in the room and the dinner... and the buffet breakfast at this hotel is really an afterthought. Bagels, Cream Cheese, Plain Yoghurt, Cereal and some average fruit constituted the $40+ buffet breakfast. Luckily we weren't too hungry and it was included in our cost, but it really isn't what you would expect from as hotel like this in the breakfast department. More of this review has come off as negative than i intended and i could probably write much more about how professional and helpful the staff were, how clean the room was and how beautiful the inside of the hotel is... but all of that goes without saying. It's a very classy establishment and it was almost the nicest hotel experience we've had in a major US city... almost. Hopefully management realizes just how close they are to giving people the perfect city escape and makes a couple of very minor adjustments to make it truly special.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cstop #1 on the college tour\u201d", "Author": "highway61nola", "ReviewID": "UR125235999", "Content": "My daughter and I spent two nights here in Feb 2012 at the start of a college tour through the Northeast.

The hotel was clean and had a nice, classic feel to it. It was classic but not run down. The room was a decent size and well appointed. The bathroom was lined with marble and was clean and modern. The room was not without it's problems though. Half the outlets were lose and didn't hold the plug in the socket well. My Blackberry and laptop chargers were constantly slipping out of the outlets. This problem also plagued their own lamps. The TV didn't work at first and required servicing by the technician before it would turn on. The furnace in the room didn't work either and had the technician in and out of my room all afternoon until it was partially resolved. The heat would work but I was instructed not to adjust the temperature up or down because it could cause the heater to malfunction again. While the bathroom looked and felt nice, the shower was another story. There was no threshold between the shower and the floor for the bathroom so I had to use most of the towels to build a makeshift dike to keep from flooding the rest of the bathroom. The shower enclosure was built with glass but they never installed a shower door so the glass juts out of the wall enclosing about 70% of the shower but then there's this big opening between the shower and the rest of the bathroom. Very bizarre and poorly designed. The hotel's restaurant is prohibitively expensive and if you order anything up to the room, you are charged an annoying service fee. You're better off going to a nearby restaurant or just ordering food from an outside option. If you can score a good price for this hotel (i.e. through Priceline) then it's definitely worth staying here. It's not worth it if you're paying regular price.

It's a gem of a boutique hotel, perfectly placed in the Back Bay area. It's beautifully kitted out - our suite was perfect for our needs. I was also pleasantly surprised at how child friendly they were, as it is a couples dream... (and my husband and I are already dreaming of coming back without the kids!) The rooms are compact, but chic and well-proportioned, the service was superb without once being ostentatious or in your face, the food was tasty and beautifully presented and overall this was a cut above anything we have stayed in recently. That said, it is not cheap - parking, room service and any other extras come at what I would see as a high price. We loved the breakfast, as did our kids, but by US standards it is expensive, with somewhat limited options. But the positives way outweigh the negatives - some examples: a really charming and attentive room service waiter who took time and effort with his food delivery, a beautifully made up child's crib (complete with a cute baby gift set), concierges and door staff who were so helpful with the stroller, and who tried to waive away tips when I was on my own with the toddler - I could go on. I really do look forward to returning to the Eliot Hotel, both with my kids and without! I am also inspired to look at boutique hotels rather than chains, after experiencing their personal and charming service... I also must complement Bookit.com., who I booked through.

Also, steer clear of the $30 per person breakfast buffet. Truly underwhelming.

The minor one was that we had no full length mirror anywhere in the room (also no coffee), the major complaint was that even though there were two restaurants in the hotel, they were only available during certain hours. In other words, during our stay, the weather became cold and very rainy. Since we didn't feel like braving the elements, we thought it'd be nice to go down and have a cup of tea or coffee or a glass of wine. No luck. They were not open. It's best to check their hours I guess. In my opinion, in a hotel as nice as this - at least a coffee or a drink should be available anytime. (other than room service) We ended up settling for room service, stuck back in our room, and received only one cup and the coffee was luke warm.

Our original trip for our friends wedding to Mexico got ruined by Hurricane Rina so we (veryyy last minute) decided to take a road trip with another couple that wasn't able to get to MX. We tried the \"unpublished hotels\" option on Expedia. It guaranteed us 4 stars and within the immediate confines of Bean Town. Fine, we got 4 stars and within the confines of Bean Town but we also got an extremely hard bed, a weird shower with only 1 door that let the cold air in and water on the floor, a crabby and cheap (with the alcohol) bartender, and nooo parking. We spent $60 on 3 drinks and 1 ended up being a double because the bartender poured less than half the glass. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 asked for more and he said he'd have to charge us for a double. Go figure?!?! We're guests at the friggin hotel!! Either way, we wish we had been in Mexico and not in cold, rainy, snowy Boston. We would recommend the hotel if you're middle aged and stuck up. The Eliot is definetly not a place for a young hot couple looking to have a laid back and fun weekend. If you're looking to spend lots o' $ and get no perks (not even free wifi or a continental breakfast) stay there. One more thing.... Breakfast will run you about $25 per person.

The bed was plush and comfortable. Service was great we had booked our room on price line and got a great price, the first room we went to had two double beds, so they made a quick easy switch for us to a very nice king sweet. However since this change was made I was charged a extra night fee to my credit card that I could not get taken off. This was a mistake by the hotel, I think because of the change of rooms. Even though I had to pay double I still love the hotel and am sure that next time I will make sure that dose not happen again. I was so impressed by the place that I, who is all about getting the best price on anything, didn't mind paying the extra charge. This is a very rare thing for me too say.

The ensuite bathroom was quite small, with a toilet, sink and shower, but beautifully appointed in marble, with Kohler fixtures and a Grohe shower which was very good.

There was also a foyer area with a minibar, sink and counter top. There is no coffee service in the room, however. Being tea drinkers, the hotel kindly lent us an electric kettle for the duration of our stay and we brought our own mugs and tea bags so we were able to enjoy a cuppa at any time.

Housekeeping was excellent and very discreet. We enjoyed turndown service every night and toiletries were replenished as soon as we asked.

We got in late on a Thursday and stayed til Sunday morning. There are many things to like about this hotel, but a few to dislike also. Positive: 1) This is a really good Back Bay location. Close to Newbury St, Prudential Center, MIT, Berklee College of Music, Fenway. 2) Hotel honors any deal you can find on any site like Orbitz or Hotels.com. This means you can get that price but with the hotel's own, more liberal, cancellation policy. In this case, I got a room for $165. Just call and specify the better rate you are looking at. 3) Staff is very helpful and pleasant. Really this was true across the board. 4) They upgraded us from a double-double to a small suite with double-double but also a living room on the other side of french doors, plus a small additional room with sink and mini-bar. So at the price, this is a very nice hotel. Negative: 1) Like lots of old hotels, their heating system is finicky. Thursday night we had no heat at all, but didn't realize it til we woke up and it was 63 in the room. After three different visits from staff we got this fixed, but we still had to fiddle with the thermostat to get the compressor to kick on on another occasion. 2) Also took 3 visits from staff to get the internet right. They have cool touch-screens with FREE internet. But it failed on many tries before they got someone in there who could make it work. Once it did, it was great. And if you want internet on your own computer, it's fast and only $5 per day. They gave us a coupon for free internet on that too because of the trouble. 3) The restaurants are quite expensive. This is not necessarily a liability, but be aware. Thursday night we wanted a snack. We each had one order of (truly excellent ) sashimi with about 4 good bites of fish each. I had a beer and my wife had a moderate priced glass of wine and my daughter had a soft drink. $100 with tip. If they give you a coupon for $10 off the Continental breakfast buffet, it is good value at $10. Heck, a cup of coffee and a glass of juice a la carte would cost nearly as much. But I wouldn't pay $20 without the coupon for the cold buffet. On the whole, I'd probably stay at the Eliot again. It is a lovely hotel and the staff is very friendly and professional. Still, it has some \"old hotel\" problems worth noting when you compare it to the $95 price you might get on the Sheraton or Hilton or Westin nearby using Hotwire or Priceline.

The safe in my room didn't work, and neither of the two phones could be used to call reception. On one phone, I could hear the person on the other end but they couldn't hear me, and the other phone had no connection to reception whatsoever. One morning, I went into the shower only to discover that housekeeping hadn't left any shampoo. (They made a mistake and left two shower gels instead.)

There's a \"high tech\" terminal where you can view your bill, order things for the room, order room service, etc. I arranged for a wake-up call, but then changed my mind about the time. Unfortunately, there was no way to change the time once it's been programmed in. And -- you guessed it -- I couldn't call reception. So I had to go downstairs to tell them in person to change my wake-up call time! I got a coupon for a half-priced continental breakfast -- $10 instead of the usual extortionate price of $20.

The restaurants in the hotel looked like they had great dinners but we didn't get a chance to try them - just breakfast. And I agree with the other reviews - breakfast needs some work. They really should just make the buffet included in the price of the room - and if not, then at least add some eggs made to order to the buffet. Right now, even with their 10 dollar off vouchers, it just doesn' t make sense to eat there.

Chose the property both for the elegance for the romantic getaway we sought and for the fact they were a dog-friendly hotel. Had a King suite on the 7th floor, quiet and to the side of the building. Mini bar with sink, but no ability to use refrigerator for our own beverages or no microwave for leftovers. Bathroom was like a small closet, but this likely has to do with the fact it's an old building and they put what they could where they could. The suite was pretty, comfortable sitting area, separated from the bedroom with wide french doors. But the ventilation system was LOUD, and didn't cycle on and off as the setting should have. Drowned out the TV and made sleeping difficult. In addition the mattress reminded us of lying down on a piece of cardboard and the white comforter had a dinner-plate sized yellow (urine?) stain on it. Ii expected more from a \"luxury\" hotel. Got a decent rate, but for the price we still had to pay $10 internet access fee and lost the access for a better part of the day. Received breakfast vouchers of $10 each good toward the $20 \"breakfast buffet\". Having had the most marvelous, out of this world dinner at Clio the evening before, we were looking forward to breakfast there. What a disappointment. The staff was cold and rude and difficult to understand. The buffet had bagels with no way to warm/toast them, no juice -- we had to ask for it after waiting 5 minutes or better for someone to notice us, then the waiter only brought one juice, not two and never returned to fill any glass, including the water -- my husband had to seek him out for more water, forget the juice!! The buffet the menu makes out to sound decadent was nothing more than yogurt cups on ice, some chopped up fruit, cardboard individual serving boxes of cereal, some croissants and a couple muffins to accompany the cold bagels. Very sparse and very disappointing given the price of not only the breakfast \"buffet\" but the accommodations as well. (no where were the \"fresh baked pastries\" touted on the menu... we've stayed at Hampton Inns for less than $100 a night had a hot breakfast with protein/eggs, toaster to heat bagels/muffins, plenty of available juice and more. I can' t believe for the price they can't put out a chafing dish of at least scrambled eggs... ) With over an hour yet to serve, there were no clean plates set out to replace the stack that got used meaning the patrons had to take their dirty plates back up to the buffet. The impression we got was that we were annoying the staff and they really just wanted the people remaining to leave. My husband was disappointed in what he originally saw on the buffet and ordered breakfast off the menu, but for $33 plus tip, we walked away hungry and disappointed. We did not return on our second morning there. Sadly, if this had been our first exposure to Clio restaurant, we would have never gone in for dinner and would have missed the outstanding experience with the wonderful meal we did have the evening before. (I suspect the morning service at the restaurant has nothing to do with Clio itself, it's only a place to serve the morning meal, but if I was Clio's chef, I'd be pretty upset about the impression they give of my restaurant...) Valet parking is available and we were satisfied with the service. Desk personnel were told about breakfast problems but shrugged it off and didn't offer to make amends in any way. All in all, with exception of the breakfast staff, the other staff were nice and friendly. The experience was nice for the most part and it is a lovely building with elegant surroundings.

My problem was that when we checked in (which was at about midnight after traveling for 12 hours) I wasn't sure what the rate for the room was supposed to be as my wife had made the reservation. So the next morning I noticed the rate was not correct so I checked on line and then went down to the desk. After discussing it with the desk person, at first he wasn't going to honor the rate. I told him it is advertised and that was supposed to be the rate we got. He finally agreed as he couldn't really take any other position. So, when I checked out I noticed that they had adjusted the rate for day 2 through 6. So I asked why the first night wasn't corrected and they said that I hadn't said anything till the next morning so they WOULD NOT correct it. I spent over $4000 that week at the Eliot, and it was really more principle then money. To top it off, and now that Im a little pissed, I look the bill over carefully and noticed they had charged me twice for room serivice one day.

However, even with the cheaper rate, we feel we didn't get our money's worth out of the hotel. First....the good. The staff was very friendly all around. The doorman, bellman, and front desk staff were always very pleasant (with or without receiving a tip). It is a great location for shopping and to go to Fenway. However, the building and accomodations had problems. I realize the building is very old, but to bill this as a 5-star hotel, some improvements should be made. Some problems were understandable (weak shower pressure, musty smell in the hallway, etc.) But some problems were plain unacceptable, even for a $80 a night room at Super 8. After looking closely at the comforters on both beds, the white fabric was stained in many places with who-knows-what. It really grossed me out so we didn't even use those blankets. I am about 6ft 2in tall and unfortunately the beds didn't accomodate my heighth and they are very hard. The windows allow a lot of nighttime noise in from the street below, so we shoved pillows around the frame to muffle the noise. They have 2 restaurants in the hotel, but both were closed during our entire stay because of the holiday. That didn't make sense to me, but it would have probably been too expensive for us anyway. But the worst part is that after our 2nd night, my friend's wife woke up with itchy little bites all over her legs.

The housekeeping staff pounds on the door at 6:15 Sunday night for turndown, we were on our way out shortly thereafter and asked them to return later. When we got home from the event we found an untouched room, par for the course for this mess of a hotel. Stay elsewhere in Boston, the Eliot is not worth your time nor your money.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, VA", "Title": "\u201cTop location, service and comfort\u201d", "Author": "dbrown46", "ReviewID": "UR6339930", "Content": "After reading the many reviews of where to stay in Boston, we settled on the Eliot Hotel and we are very happy we made that decision. The hotel is ideally located less than one block from the green line T in Back Bay. Newbury Street shops are an easy stroll and we easily walked to Boston Common, Beacon Hill, Downtown and even to the North End (we had good weather!). The bus to Harvard also stops right at the corner and cabs were easy hailed by the doormen. Service is very efficient and friendly, from opening doors and helping with luggage to efficient check in and check out to room service requests for a refrigerator, extra glasses and ice to an accommodating business center. The room we had was a spacious 6th floor suite with lots of space. The room was incredibly quiet, there was lots of hot water and strong water pressure and there were windows which opened (the hotel is kept a little too warm for my taste). Furnishings were very tasteful and bed linens were very comfortable. We were upgraded to this suite and charged $235 per night. For a tourist, I think this is the best location and value in Boston since when you return from (easily accessible) sightseeing, your home away from home is in a very safe neighborhood with many restaurants and shops.

The combination of well decorated bedroom and a separate living room (more than big enough for 5 people to sit in comfort) was a winner, especially compared to a 'brand' hotel. There were loads of staff on duty in the lobby on returning to the hotel in the late afternoon, but bizarrely a pot of tea took between 20 and 30 minutes each time to get to the room. Kettles are needed for each room, and also individual safe deposits in the room, rather that just at reception. The hotel restaurant Clio is seriously ambitious, and obviously very popular with Bostonians, extremely intense flavours, quite rich - and of course expensive!

The first was my honeymoon in September 2001. Then, we chose The Eliot because it had always supported the public interest organization at my law school by donating vouchers for our annual auction. Based on how much my husband and I enjoyed the 2001 stay, I returned for a four-day business and personal trip five years later. During the interval, The Eliot only got better. For a city hotel, the rooms are spacious and inviting, with a pleasant, comfortable, but sophisticated mix of traditional and contemporary furnishings. The color scheme trends toward the browns and golds, with touches of blue and lovely, clean white in the bathroom. A particular plus is the walk-in closet, which is easily four times the size of the closet you would find in any other hotel. At $265/night, The Eliot is an exceptional value. I appreciated the superb customer service that I received not only from the hotel staff--delivery of business FedExes and faxes was lightning-swift--but also from the cordial and highly professional wait staff in Clio. I dined alone there on a Wednesday night and felt particularly well cared for and well-fed. The wireless internet access in the office area of the room was hampered initially by interference, but the front desk promptly had the service provider contact me, and the provider assured that front desk staff brought me a bridge, readily solving the problem. I had four highly productive days at The Eliot, punctuated by enjoyable exchanges with friendly, competent, diverse staff and pleasant short walks around the lovely Back Bay. Based on two experiences over five years as both a leisure and a business traveler, I would recommend The Eliot without hesitation, and plan to treat this exceptional small hotel as my first choice for all future travel to Boston.", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Back Bay Choice\u201d", "Author": "j9289", "ReviewID": "UR5797768", "Content": "My wife, son and I just spent two nights and were impressed by this hotel, which certainly deserves the great recognition and reviews it gets.

We wanted to stay in Boston Saturday night to be close to the airport for our Sunday morning flight. We have stayed in several hotels in Boston over the years and we were thrilled with this hotel. We had a premier suite that was large and perfect for us. The living room was a perfect place to put our daughter in her pack n play and she slept late the next day because of the wonderful draperies blocking the light (until you open them-we had a great view of Commonwealth Ave.!!) Were able to close the french doors to our bedroom and watch a little tv without disturbing her. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated. Our room was in hues of blue and chocolate brown. The bathroom was restored, but still had beautiful old white marble and a seperate area to put on your makeup with good lighting. There is also a seperate wet bar area off of the living room that was a great space to keep our daughter supplies, food and bottles. The bed was very comfortable and my husband really enjoyed the wireless internet. The Eliot is also in a fabulous location and just a short walk to so many wonderful restaurants and shops.

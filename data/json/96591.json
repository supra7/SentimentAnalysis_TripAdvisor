We stayed in a room with two queen beds. Positives: - The woman who took our reservation on the phone was very helpful and friendly. - The room contained attractive, yet simple furniture. - There was a small chest of drawers or dresser that was just the right height for placing luggage on top of it, in addition to a folding luggage stand. - Iron & ironing board and hair dryer in room. - A nice assortment of pillows of various degrees of softness/firmness were on each bed. - There was a newer flat screen TV with a good picture. - There were two sinks in the room - one inside the bathroom and one outside. - Although we didn't use it, we could see the indoor pool and hot tub when we ate breakfast, and I noticed there were towels down there so that you don't have to bring one from your room. However, swimmers need to be aware that this pool area is visible from not only the lobby, but also to people walking outside on their way to the front door. - The breakfast was generous and good (except for a rather strange-tasting danish I tried). The seating area is very generous; it probably allows for more diners than any other hotel I've stayed in. There were two rooms full of tables, as well as a long \"community table.\" - The breakfast workers were very friendly and helpful. - We opted out of maid service, and upon our return to our room there was a nice note slid under the door by the maids informing us that they came back at 4:00 and we still had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door. They advised us to check with the front desk for clean towels and supplies. - We requested a last-minute late check-out, and it was cheerfully granted to us. Negatives: - I found the bed to be hard. My shoulder and hip hurt in the morning. - The duvet on one bed was slightly dirty in one area. - There is a bright green light on the smoke alarm that kind of lights up the room when you're trying to sleep. (I think red lights make more sense for this purpose.) - The air conditioning unit in our room made an occasional humming sound during the night which woke me up a few times. - Our room didn't have a working exhaust fan in the bathroom. - The bathtub/shower had a slow drain that would make the bathtub fill up with water as we showered. - Also, the pipes in our room made an intermittent whistling/squealing sound when using either the shower or the sink outside of the bathroom. - The towels are advertised to be \"fluffy,\" yet we found they had fluffy towels on top and thin, scratchy towels underneath them. - We found a large roach in our room, on the wall near the door to the room. - Although the hotel's website advertises a \"Business Center,\" it actually consists of one computer on a very small desk right next to breakfast tables, offering no privacy from diners. Also it should be noted that there is a sign next the computer stating that access to social sites such as Facebook, adult sites, and gambling sites is not allowed. We were glad to see the policy regarding adult sites and gambling, but we thought some people may not be happy about the social sites restriction.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, OK", "Title": "\u201cReally shows it's age\u201d", "Author": "goinallover", "ReviewID": "UR81536112", "Content": "We checked in here after we discovered that the other Hampton had very small rooms without fridge and microwave.

My hard earned vacation dollars are very important to me and I do not like surprises. With that said, I am glad I followed my gut feeling and not that of some of the reviews about this Hampton Inn. This hotel, simply said, was wonderful in every aspect. My wife and I went there for a week long anniversary trip and had a great time. Here is the breakdown: HOTEL: The hotel sits in a perfect location on Hwy 76, one block from the yellow and red routes. It is only 4 miles to Silver Dollar City. Parking is free and plentiful. It is close to numerous restaurants and music shows. The property, inside and out, is very clean. Indoor pool and hottub which was nice after a long day being a tourist. Room: We had a room on the 4th floor on the back side. It had a nice view of the mountains and a large church parking lot. It was very clean and spacious with a flat screen tv. It had a seperate sink/dressing area and nice size closet. Also the standard desk/chair combo and a comfy chair and ottoman. Bed was very comfortable as is the usual with Hampton Inn. Staff: Absolutely wonderful. Greeted with a warm \"good morning\" every day. Very eager to please and accomodate. Even told me how to save some money on the music shows. Note: use the ticket service they recommend. Tickets were cheaper than anywhere else and you can order them by phone and they will drop them off at front desk at no charge! Very convenient. Staff was some of the nicest folks I have ever met. Breakfast: Always two hot items and belgian waffles every morning. Great selection of cereals, pastries, fruits, yogurts, etc. A very good start to the day and it's included! The hotel has a nice, very comfortable resting/lounge area in the front lobby. Every afternoon, they have warm chocolate chip cookies and a USA Today paper to enjoy. The manager, Debbie Kitchen, is doing a great job with this property. The property is 18 years old but you cannot tell it by looking. It is very clean and does not look in any way rundown. I had absolutely no problems with security issues or the daily maid service.

Absolutely nothing wrong or undesirable from our perspective. 2 adults & child stayed for 2 days on 5th (top) floor, odd numbered room that was on the (east) side away from the strip.

If you want to see the fireworks at Celebration City at night from your window get a room on the side along the highway, which may(?) expose you to some traffic noise. Overall it was very quiet. While we heard a slamming door or two, we never heard any voices. Clean, modern room & bath with very comfortable beds. Lots of extra pillows to choose from. No A/C, plumbing or electrical issues. Indoor pool & hot tub. Clean, clear, no chlorine smell, and good temp. The pool was a bit smaller than I prefer - your not going to swim laps here - but was fine for splashing around in. 3' deep at one end quickly dropping off to 5' for most of it. The pool area didn't have much activity at all. We had it totally to ourselves the first night, and there was just one other family there the second. I'm guessing this is mostly due to this time of year most guests are Sr. citizens that may not use the pool as much. (but it did seem a little odd that essentially no one else was using it. Oh well, that not a complaint!) Front desk was quick and courteous. The ladies running the breakfast areas did an awesome job. They were working like crazy, keeping everything full and cleaned up. They put up temporary tables in the lobby area to handle the \"crunch-time\" breakfast crowd so there was always a table available. That was nice. I hate fighting over a table for breakfast. Different egg/sausage combos each morning. If you don't have time for breakfast, there are \"breakfast grab bags\" at the front desk w/ fruit, muffin, cereal bar & water you can grab and take with you. I've never seen this before - not sure how common it is - but I thought it was neat. Wireless internet was OK. While I (usually) got 11 MBS, the signal was clearly low strength side in our room.

This Hampton Inn is about at the end of the strip of restaurants, shows, etc. There is a Cracker Barrel just a five minute walk down the street and an Olive Garden across from the Cracker Barrel. Our visit was in late October so the traffic was not too bad, and that probably helped make this a good place for us. The room and bathroom were very clean. There is a sink outside the bath/toilet area, which I always appreciate. There were plenty of electrical outlets in this room. I had no trouble finding an outlet for my laptop near the round table, which was a good workplace. All the lights had 100 watt bulbs. Very good - now that we are retired we travel in the fall and it gets dark early, so having good lighting is important to us as we spend our evening time reading, doing crosswords, etc. Another couple we know stayed in the room across the hall from us. Their room had a flatscreen TV but our room did not. The large eating area was very nice, as it overlooked the indoor swimming pool. They offered hot chocolate all day and kept the apple basket full during the afternoon and evening. The lobby lounge is ajacent to the eating/breakfast area so it's very handy and pleasant. We spent two nights there so they offered different sausage and egg entrees each morning. One morning they served fajitas with scrambled eggs and sausage mixed together with salsa for an optional topper. The next morning they had sausage patties and fried eggs with white gravy. They had plenty of food out during the serving time. Most of the people staying there were retired like us and enjoying a relaxing morning. The lobby was quite large and had plenty of room to lounge and congregate for games, conversation, and for using the Internet service they provided. The check in staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived on a Thursday evening and they had hot chocolate chip cookies sitting out but they did not offer them on Friday and Saturday, the weekend evenings. Our room was cleaned while we were gone and ready for us by the time we returned in the early afternoon. I would recommend this Hampton Inn during a visit to Branson.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite in Branson\u201d", "Author": "BigTXN", "ReviewID": "UR10361333", "Content": "This was our third time to stay here.

Not always the case when you go to a hotel... Breakfast was really great - different hot items each day; french toast sticks, biscuits/gravy, eggs...always cereal, fruits, juices, things to put in a toaster, and sweets like muffins and pastries. Different coffees too. Seemed to be plenty of seating - I think it's open from 6 am-10 am, so people trickled in and out. Staff very nice, helpful. Across the street is a big trinket shop - souveneirs, etc. Oh - they also have a computer sitting in the lobby so you can check emails, look up show times, too. Very nice. Laundry on 1st floor with pool, so if you're soaked from Silver Dollar City you can dry your things there - $1.00 to dry. We stay in lots of hotels, so I know now to ask for room away from elevator/stairs and ice machines. Quiet room on 5th floor was great!! We were facing the strip - 76, and at night, the kids watched the fireworks from Celebration City outside the window.

We also found that the pool was warm and nice to be able to excercise in and the whirlpool was soothing. Again at the end of the day, I was ready for something like this to loosen my spine. We found the staff very friendly and they constantly seemed to want to make our stay enjoyable Also around 4:00 p.m. if you are around, it is hard to resist the fresh hot chocolate chip cookies they set out. Another nice thing we liked about it was that it is located in a less busy area where it is quieter. I always take these reviews objectively and realize sometimes you just get a bad night at times. Also some people will pick a place apart even if there is nothing to really pick apart. But I would definitely highly recommend this place to anyone.

We love Branson and had spent a majority of our stays at The Hampton Inn West. Well our last stay in April 2007 will probably be our last as there are many other hotels to choose from. Why the change? 1) I am a Hilton Diamond member ( the top of the line for frequent travelers-Hampton is owned by Hilton Corp) I worked hard in my travels to obtain my status. When asked about a room upgrade I was basically told that being a Diamond member at this hotel doesn't mean much--If it was January or February than maybe they could have done something for me. 2) We were there the 3rd weekend in April, stayed a long weekend. I had my lap top and tried many times to connect to their wireless web and had problems. When I asked the front desk manager for help she was kind of short and said that she didn't know anything about it and to call the number in my room for help. I called 3 times. The first time I called they couldn't help me and told me they'd call me back, which they never did. Bottom line we were able to periodically connect. The help line told me that I probably couldn't connect because most of the guests were probably trying to use the web. That's reassuring on a weekend. 3) My wife and I felt the oevrall customer service has declined at this facility. They used to be more friendly but now they have a basic service attitude. They have changed the general manager and eliminated small things, that make a difference, like free evening ice cream. 4) The claimed they did a renovation last winter. The only major renovation in our room was the new beds. Everything else, including the older carpet were the same. ( The beds they replaced should have been replace at least 5 years ago but the owners of this facility were holding out as long as possible without having to reinvest in their guests comfort) If it wasn't for the brand new Hilton Hotel opening at The New Branson Landing the beds would probably still be the same old ones--I would recommend checking out the new Hilton as it looks really nice Bottom line is The Hampton is average. They, like many hotels in Branson, derive their business on group tours(senior citizens) who are there on a bus tour and stay 2 to 3 days and are happy with what they get. This Hampton used to be a step up in their service but now I feel like they treat you as a group tour-take it or leave it. Well my wife and I are taking our $85 per night elsewhere where we can spend less and get better service.

We were in their \"mini-suite\" (Room 530). It is an oversized room with a king-size bed, a sleeper sofa, tv with cable, mini-kitchen that had a small fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. The bathroom was average size, and there was an additional vanity across from the closet. The decor was nice...typically neutral with a pretty bedspread and a couple of attractive pictures on the walls. There are plenty of towels, and the hotel and our room were very clean. The hallways are wide and well-lit. One oddity...the coffeemaker has no glass pot. You can only brew one cup of coffee at a time. Paper cups are provided, but it is really strange and probably only works well with one adult in the room! The free breakfast is located in a nice separate area right off of the lobby...great selection of donuts, bagels, toast, cereal etc. And in the evening (9:30 to 11 PM), they serve vanilla softserve with three choices of toppings for free! (The kids love that!). There is a nice pool and hot tub located in a very large room on the lower level; the hotel provides towels in the swimming area so you don't have to take them from your room. The front desk people are quite friendly and helpful. Extra pillows and blankets were available upon request. There is a charming lady in the lobby that will get you tickets for any of the shows. On the main floor, there are ice and vending machines. The hotel is very quiet, and there are plenty of USA Today's every morning in the lobby. If you are a Hilton Honors member, they will hang one on your door. This hotel is perfectly located to enjoy the three main theme parks of Branson...White Water, Silver Dollar City and Celebration City. We could get back to the Hampton Inn from Celebration City in less than 5 minutes. All in all, a great place to stay in the Branson area!!

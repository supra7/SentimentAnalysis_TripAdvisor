My wife and I stayed there based on the hotel's relationship (same owners) to one of our favorite hotels in Portland (OR), the Hotel Lucia. We stayed at the Lucia a few times prior to moving to Portland in 2008 and always liked it. In any case, my experiences with Hotel Max have been, frustratingly, all over the board. Sometimes fine, sometimes not so fine. We'd been told that the rooms were small and strangely shaped, but this was something we could learn to live with. One time, we were unfortunate enough to get a room near the elevators, and the constant buzzing and vibration made for a sleepless night. Over time, we learned what sort of room to ask for. I have also tried other nearby hotels - the Westin, the Mayflower and the Andra - but since my meeting was nearby, I thought that I'd try Max again. This time, however, I was quite unhappy with the room. One thing that concerns me is that, regardless of the number of times I've stayed there, the folks at the front desk don't seem to know this. I'm always asked \"Have you ever stayed with us before?\" and I always answer \"Yes, many times\", to which they reply, \"Welcome Back\". Although I'm not there THAT often, shouldn't they know that I'm a bit of a regular? Anyway, I was put into room 821 (I'd requested a room on a higher floor, to stay away from street noise) and I have to say that this room is in need of a make-over. It's on the back side of the building and, unfortunately, there is a VERY loud exhaust vent a few floors down that was a constant nuisance. When I first checked in to the room, I heard the noise, thought that it was going to be something that would go away, dropped off my luggage and ran out to my meeting and dinner afterwards. I returned to the room late (around midnight) to find that it was FREEZING in my room. I walked over to the window and looked for leaks, but all I felt was a breeze coming from somewhere. The carpeting near the window was quite tattered near the edges - perhaps that was the source. I then turned on the window-mounted heater/AC unit to warm things up. It also has a loud fan, but I was willing to live with it so long as it generated heat. When I turned it off, however, the room quickly got cold again. One of the lamps near the bed did not operate. I saw that it was unplugged, so I plugged it in. I turned on the lamp and the bulb went out immediately, so I unplugged the lamp and left the cord visible for the hotel service folks... The closet is absolutely tiny - about 3 feet wide and no more than a foot deep - so you had to hang your clothes on an angle. The closet near the front door was converted into a small shower room, while the actual bathroom contained only a toilet and small sink and is no more than 3 feet wide (almost like the bathroom on an airplane). The toilet seat would not stay up - another frustration! On the plus side, the bed is comfortable, the pillows are quite nice, the TV worked well, and there are good coffee and tea selections (free). The lobby is nice, the location is excellent, and the service (except for the aforementioned memory loss) is usually good. This is why this place is so frustrating to me - I think that, if management was really paying attention, they'd notice the things I found and work hard to fix them. So, in the end, I end up telling myself that its just not worth the aggravation anymore. I do hope, however, that hotel management will do what they can to make sure that new customers find their stays more enjoyable than mine was...", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reggio Emilia, Italy", "Title": "\u201cquiet\u201d", "Author": "ITA_And_RE_a", "ReviewID": "UR124426273", "Content": "it has a perfect location in downtown Seattle.

I chose Hotel Max due to the rank/price ratio. I knew ahead of time about the valet parking fee. I asked about the wi-fi fee and was immediately offered a comp pass. The Queen room is small with a tiny bathroom that was as big as the closet. Speaking of the closet, there is no light in there or the entry way so you are reaching blindly into a black void. (OK not that dark but pretty close.) The room is tiny and half of the counter space and storage space is taken up by the coffee maker, snacks, mini bar, hair dryer, iron, safe, etc. There is absolutely no where to put toiletries except for a little glass ledge that held my toothbrush and soap and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Luckily that was all I had. I arrived at 11am and had planned on parking my car at the hotel and walking to the market until check in time at 4pm. They were nice enough to look for an open room and I was able to check in early. Unfortunately the toilet seat had wet urine spots (or some other wet yellow spots) and that made me wonder what else hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned. If the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready then they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have offered it as an option. Not sure what the valets did with my car but the radio was reset and I had to go to the Honda dealership to have it unlocked. I liked the location.

The decor is fun and the rooms are clean. The room was small and the bathroom was very small. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning. A lot of the extra things they do to make the hotel stand out from others came off to me as hokey. A spiritual menu instead of a bible in a drawer. It's a nice touch but I'd be curious to know how many people actually use the service because they really want to. Not just because they can. We almost ordered something off the pillow menu just because we could but never got around to it. The location is great. It made walking around to several places very easy and I didn't have to worry about getting the car out. When I made my reservation I was given a price of the rooms and a price for one of their packages I wanted to take advantage of. For some reason I was not able to pay ahead at the time because of the package I paid extra for on top of the room. I didn't think it would be a big deal but when we checked out I found that it was. (I'm not sure if this is something many hotels do, but in my experience I haven't come across it) Booking a room is like booking a flight, where each day is different and the price can change on you. Not only had the price gone up, but it was different each day we stayed. We were two couples staying in one room and though they said we could split up the payments no problem they really had a hard time with it resulting in one of us with a double charge on a card for several days till the return went through and the other having to call back later to figure out what was going on with the charges. Also, after arriving, I stood outside to wait for someone and noticed an outcry followed by a conversation next to my car. The valet who was going to park it did not know how to drive a manual. I watched to make sure he didn't try learning with my car but another valet (that was telling him how to drive one) took the car instead. Overall I actually would recommend if you stay here to use the valet because your other option is street parking, which costs a little more and you have to be sure time doesn't run out. I did not have a confident feeling about it though. I don't think a valet should be hired if he or she cannot drive both a manual and automatic. This was a learning experience for me even as a fairly seasoned traveler. I won't stay here again and I'll be doing even more research when it comes to the mid - higher end hotels that up-charge for everything.

They are probubly the most expenisve place in the area. WOW. But agian, I didnt eat there, maybe it was worth the money? Ok, onto the good. I love how unique it is. I dont know any other place that decorates their building quite like this. They have black and white pictures on every door and down the hall way. The rooms are great. I read another person say that the rooms are small but I did not have that problem. No it wasnt the bigest room and no the bathroom wasnt the biggest but It defintly wasnt the smallest. Its my understanding that each room is different. It defiently had a modern flair. The bathroom was just as unique as the rest of the place. Service was great, the man at the counter actually did the best he could to help us. We tried to get a room at the last minute and man did we have a problem. Fortunatly the staff was really helpful and friendly. No, it wasnt right next door to downtown but it definelty wasnt far, It was within walking distance. All in all it was a great place.

Upon arrival our room wasn't ready, but we were an hour early due to our flight time. The clerk took our suitcases and advised us to come back in half an hour. We gave it 40 mins and on our return we were able to check in. It was a different clerk and, noticing we were on our honeymoon he kindly offered us an upgrade from the queen room we'd booked to a king room. We were also given complimentary wifi, which was lucky as we weren't aware we'd have to pay for it! We made our way up to our room on the 9th floor (our bags were taken up for us), which had a great view of the space needle. However, people on here aren't lying when they mention the small rooms! Our king bed was lovely, but we could only half open our suitcases, which then left us with barely any space to tip-toe around. Luckily for us, as we'd been upgraded our bathroom had a tub, so we naturally had more space in there compared to a lot of people who have left reviews. We're British, so we're used to modest sized hotels and bathrooms. The room was very clean and the ipod dock/alarm clock came to good use. We didn't have any noise problems, but the weather was temperate, we were high up and at the end of the corridor, so we didn't have have people noise, a/c noise or traffic noise to contend with. The corridors are filled with arty photography and we took a trip to the 5th floor to check out the grunge photo doors (Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden etc). Indie-rock is played in the hotel lobby and out onto the street, which makes a pleasant change to the elevator music or silence you usually get in a hotel lobby. The staff were all friendly, but we didn't need to deal with them apart from checking in/out. Unfortunately the lack of space means we've had to mark them down on a couple of points. We were braced for small rooms, but its lucky we're relatively small people. Don't bother taking your yoga mat. Location wise, it's pretty well placed for everything central. We didn't take any cabs while we were there and managed to walk to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, took the monorail to the Space Needle and EMP and even walked up to the Capitol Hill district (we recommend the Honeyhole for great, reasonably priced food and a cool atmosphere). Some advice - if you can afford it, go for a bigger room. However, if you're just using it as somewhere to crash, the space shouldn't be a problem. If you can carry all your luggage, take the light rail from the airport instead of a cab. It's $2.75 one way and the last stop is about 2 blocks away from the hotel. We had a morning flight out of Seattle and it was much more reliable than the infamous traffic system in the area. Top Pot Donuts is a few blocks away in Belltown and is great for breakfast (even according to President Obama himself). To be honest, Seattle is a quiet place so you can probably do all the main sights in a couple of days. We were there for 2 1/2 days and by the end of the last day were struggling for things to do. It is one of the friendliest cities we've ever been to though, with people on the street helping us if we looked lost and even the airport staff cracking a joke or two.

In its immediate vicinity (one or two blocks away) there is a McDonald's, a Subway, two Starbucks (both within a one-minute walk), various (mostly high-end) restaurants, FareStart (a fine-dining restaurant that offers lunch Monday-Friday and dinner Thursday, giving homeless and other disadvantage people an opportunity to train for a restaurant job - highly recommended!), various convenience stores (the closest one being the Westlake Specialty Market, being located within the same block), a Bank of America branch, the Seattle Courthouse of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle Greyhound Station, and other hotels (such as the Westin Seattle). Hotel Max is pretty much located at the northern end of the downtown core. If you want to walk to the central library (as a proxy for the heart of the downtown core) it will take you about 15 minutes. Westlake Station, a light-rail station that allows you to go from and to the airport for only $2.75 is only a ten-minute walk from the hotel. Travel time using the SoundTransit Central Link Light Rail from or to the airport is 38 minutes and trains depart every 7.5 to 15 minutes depending on the time of the day (note that trains do not run during the night). The light-rail station at the airport is a bit of a walk from the terminals, so in total, including the maximum time you may have to wait for a train, I would allow for, say, 70 minutes to get from the airport terminal to the hotel or vice versa. The exterior and the lobby of Hotel Max sport a very modern designer look - as do the hallways. The rooms are not as modern/designer looking as the rest of the hotel - they look like those of a typical U.S. urban boutique hotel, with the important addition that every room has an actual painting or photograph, or actual paintings and/or photographs, by Seattle artists in it. My room had two paintings on the walls. The audience is very diverse - from young couples to young groups of friends to older couples. However, overall, I suspect that most of the guests here are quite well-off, regardless of their age. By North American standards, the rooms are small. My \"Queen of Art\" room (the second-smallest category of rooms they have) was approx. 16 sq metres = 170-175 sq ft - that's including the bathroom (but excluding the - small - closet). Unless I mismeasured, this is actually a bit smaller than the 190-230 sq ft range mentioned on the hotel website, even when adding the closet space. Keep in mind that many nice classic downtown hotels in large U.S. cities have small rooms - many rooms at the Club Quarters Chicago, Wacker at Michigan are even smaller for example. Also, the only area of my room where I felt that more space would have been nice was the shower cabin - otherwise, they have used the space very well. I had a nice queen size bed that could be accessed from both sides, the desk could be used comfortably, and people of normal size could walk around the room without any problems. My room had an LCD TV from LG (28 inches if I'm not mistaken) and a small minibar/fridge by GE (useful if you have medications that need to be refrigerated, or want to buy some milk for breakfast). My room also had a coffee maker (Waring by Cuisinart), an ice bowl, two mugs, and two glasses. In terms of seating there was one very comfortable wheeled chair as well as one ottoman. My room also had a window A/C unit by GE. I could see the Space Needle from my two windows. At least on my floor room numbers ending in x07 or lower were looking towards the northwest (Space Needle) whereas room numbers ending in x08 or higher were looking towards the southeast (Seattle University). As already mentioned, the hotel is essentially located at the north end of the downtown core (which is much nicer than the jail/Qwest Field south end). If you are a fast walker and know where you are headed, you can make it from your hotel room to your meeting room at the Washington State Convention & Trade Center in ten minutes (I took the time). Even if you don't know the directions yet and walk at a normal pace it will only take you a bit more than 15 minutes. Overall it's a very beautiful and well run hotel. The rate I received was excellent for what this hotel offers, much better than anything else I found in this part of Seattle, and I would certainly pick it again given the same relative price. However, I also have a few (sixteen, to be precise) quibbles with it. First, the three light switches are still a mystery to me. I thought that it would be logical to have one of the three for the bedroom ceiling light, one for the bathroom light, and one for the bathroom fan. Alas, that wasn't the case. I tried every possible combination and still wasn't able to turn on the bedroom ceiling light without also turning on the bathroom light and fan (bathroom light and fan unfortunately use a single switch). Interestingly the bathroom fan is almost not noticeable if you close the bathroom door, but it's a considerable waste of energy and completely unnecessary. I'm not sure if this is the same in all rooms or whether somebody messed up the electrical system in my room. Second, the windows are old and single-paned and don't protect very well against noise and draft. Just to be clear: it was NOT loud in my room, and I did NOT feel cold in it. But it was still a bit of a strange feeling since somehow the room never seemed to be quite \"closed\". Third, the cleaning staff seem to be a bit idiosyncratic. My wastebasket in the washroom was moved around twice (when I arrived it was located next to the toilet bowl, the following day they moved it underneath the sink, and day after that they moved it back next to the toilet bowl), and they threw away a plastic spoon that I had left on the desk. Interestingly I had also left various other items that could be interpreted as garbage on my desk but those were not thrown away. So if you have anything that may be interpreted as garbage but that you really want to keep, place it in your suitcase (or, if you are paranoid, but it into the safe deposit box in your closet). My approach is that hotel cleaning staff should never throw anything away unless it's in the garbage. One day they also did not replace one of the rolls of toilet paper. I received bath soap only on the second-last day of my stay; before that, always only facial soap. None of that is a big deal really, but slightly annoying. Fourth, for some strange reason, the rooms are quite soundproof with respect to the hallway, but not with respect to adjacent rooms. Despite the fact that the interior walls all seem to be masonry. So if you have noisy next-door neighbours you may have to change rooms. Fifth, my alarm clock was not backlit. Sixth, windows look towards patio/offices (at least the ones that look towards Space Needle), hence you have to use blinds for privacy - same in most U.S. downtown areas, but still annoying. Seventh, the sink runoff was very slow in my room. Eighth, power outlets were rare and hard to find in my room. Ninth, you have to pay for (wireless) Internet access. You can either get it for 24 hours ($11.95) or get a 4x 24-hour package ($35.85, i.e. $8.96 per 24-hour interval). Given that the room rate is very good (and that the Internet charge is also relatively competitive), this still means that the overall price is very competitive, but still something you should be aware of. Tenth, similarly, breakfast costs extra. Breakfast is served by the well-known Red Fin Sushi Restaurant that is located in the same building. Most breakfasts run about $12-14. I had the shiitake mushroom frittata for $13 and it was truly excellent, highly recommended. Again, even if you factor in $13 for breakfast and $13 for Internet this hotel is still a good deal compared to other comparable hotels in the area, but it's good to be aware of these costs beforehand. Eleventh, they charge you even for a toothbrush kit ($15!!!) which in the vast majority of hotels you get for free. Twelfth, there are only two elevators, in a building with ten floors and more than 160 rooms, implying that waiting for the elevator sometimes takes a long time. Thirteenth, the keycard has to be inserted the \"wrong\" way around. Fourteenth, the room doors are supposed to be self-closing but mine didn't fully close by itself. I had to manually pull/push it to close it. Fifteenth, front desk staff were very slow and almost surprised when I wanted to check out and asked them where the closest cash machine was. Sixteenth, the hotel staff take some time to check their email. (However, they were also kind enough to print my boarding passes for me before I left.) So overall, despite my sixteen quibbles, a very good hotel and, as far as I could tell, far better priced than anything comparable. Definitely recommended!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBeds are very comfy\u201d", "Author": "nickit98", "ReviewID": "UR117193668", "Content": "Hotel Max is a great value for the location.

That said, the location is great for tourists or people who plan to be out all day sightseeing and yet are centrally located and don't need a car. The \"hotel\" manages to add a bit of fun/ playfulness, if you are on vacation that might be a perk. If you travel with a car prepare on spending about $30 a night to park here. With the price I paid on Hotwire, I was okay with it. But this place feels more like a private room in a hostel, than a hotel. It is kinda a neat \"Seattle\" and \"urban\" experience. Especially if you are kinda sheltered and want \"an experience\" with your lodging. The room is VERY small. but also clean and cute. But don't forget, very small. The front desk clerk seemed a bit unprofessional, but acceptable. The maid walked in on us dressing at 9am, even though we had the \"Nope\" tag clearly on the door and responded to her knocks. She still walked in. Walked out and then started singing loudly outside the door. If you like this sort of thing, great. The Hotel Max is in a cool older building, that has been revamped with paint and \"funky\" touches.

Reading reviews, trying to find the most stars for the least money. Pictures helped too. We eventually came upon this hotel. Sweet decor, contemporary themes, and great reviews. So, we booked. Turned out that the packaging was great, but the substance was just tragic. Oh where to start. How about the moment we pulled up and learned that it was mandatory valet parking if we wanted to take advantage of hotel parking (and the advertised discount). Fine, except I hate valet parking. Already in the minuses. Also interesting was a note in the Hotel Max room info book saying you needed to tell them at least 30 minutes before you leave to have access to your car. More minuses. Throughout the weekend, service was solid. Check in was smooth. After that, we realized the great pictures, the great decor, was about the only part of the hotel that can be considered great. The room made some hotel rooms I've stayed in a country like Japan, look like a Shangri-La penthouse. To say it was tiny would be saying The Bieb's kind of popular. Our first thought when we saw the bathroom: airplane, economy class. A basic law of physics is no two objects can occupy the same space. In our bathroom, that meant the throne, and the sink. I think the designers got distracted with trying to prove that law wrong. Just by looking at it, we knew it would be impossible to sit square on it. No shelves or counters to put things on either. Resulted in knocking toothbrushes and other toiletries off the sad excuse for a glass ledge, and into the toilet and garbage. Not done yet. The bed. GREAT to lie down to nap, or relax. HORRIBLE to actually do what its meant for: to sleep in. The stupid thing was concave and we both woke up tired, sore and did I mention tired from keeping ourselves propped up on the sides. No mattress pad (other than this diaper cloth looking thing). Our Saturday morning started with a startle. Horns, shouting and chants. Turns out the owners of the place also own a hotel in San Fran and are Union dissolvers. A local activist group decided it would be just swell to make us answer for it, and wake us up. I know this was not in the control of the hotel management, but in the end, they have to answer to a unpleasant Saturday morning wake up call. Wi-Fi didn't work, room filled with someone else's cigarette smoke, and the valet parking lost our friends' car. Two plus': Location is great. And the Red Fin restaurant is stellar. Great Happy Hour choices, service, sushi, and great desserts. So it wasn't all bad. Just 98% bad. Oh wait, the restaurant doesn't really count.

My room was on the 5th floor. Seattle was the last stopover during my family's 13 days trip to Vancouver, Victoria Canada and Seattle in WA, and it became the last and the worst experience for my family's long waiting-for travel. I'm writing to let other travelers know about the bad service level at front desk and horrible amenities and facilities of Hotel Max. I have to mention first that there's just one thing that stands out for the Hotel...the location. It's 20 minutes walk to Space Needle and 15 minute's walk to Pike Place Market, so it gets credit especially when I don't want to drive to major attractions in the city center. However, beware of other factors that overweigh the hotel's merits. 1. I read some reviews that say the front desk is kinda funky. But, I would like to say that it's low quality and less professional. And, sometimes it's outrageous. The night before I checked in, I phoned to ask for two beds room rather than one bed room. The guy at front desk seemed busy and put me on hold in line. I waited several minutes and the line was disconnected. When I called back, front desk didn't apologize for disconnection and even giggled when I said the line was disconnected. I made a hotel reservation using one of hotel reservation sites, and, when I asked for two beds room, the front desk said there would be $30 more charge on the original bill, which is $15 per night. I pointed out that in every hotel I stayed before I had the right to choos between two beds room and one bed room. It was quite a hassle to talk about it. And, the front desk was not kind and professional enough in listening to my request on a bed type I prefer. When I said I can't understand the surcharge based on the type of bed, he finally said, \"We probably could work things out when you arrive at the hotel tomorrow.\"... I phoned to make sure about the type of room I would stay, and I coulnd't believe what he's saying...It's hotel policy to hold out important decision until the guest arrives at the hotel?? 2. The guests who have this hotel in mind should be wary of poor amenities and room environment of this hotel. By the time I went to bed, I found that the heater in my room is really loud....Much Louder than you can imagine. I swear that my 2 year old baby and wife couldn't have a good sleep, and had to wake up many times because of loud droning of that Old Fashined Heater...!!...What's unbelievable is that we can't enter or dial a temperature I want for the heater, which made me wake up so many times at night to turn on and off the heater....Just imagine!...You wake up to turn off when the room is hot and wake up again to turn on when the room is too cold...Never expect any automatic system to adjust temperature... 3. What's more surprising was very small bathroom and Very Poor flushing of water.... we had to take every care so that the water doesn't drown out of the toilet. And, we had to pull the lever several times to flush the water...And, even though I found that it's already mentioned in another review, the bathroom is extremely small...I can't even stretch my arms on the bathtub.. I couldn't believe it's the room and bathroom of the 3 and 1/2 star rating hotel...Some good paintings in the room was interesting and creative I would say. But, too many photos on the doors and walls of hotel were rather distracting than attractive. Once again, beware of that old fashioned heater that prevents you from having good sleep and poor quality bathroom that disturbs you everytime you go in there. Once again, I should say the location of hotel is good. But, considering low quality level of front desk service and room amenities, I would never stay here again if I visit my sister in Vancouver again and have another opportunity to make a trip around Seattle area.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bismarck, ND", "Title": "\u201cStay for the location and valet parking\u201d", "Author": "ChellinND", "ReviewID": "UR100406025", "Content": "The last time I was in Seattle was October and the previous year in October as well. Kept seeing Hotel Max on the corner and thought it looked funky and an awesome location close to everything. This much is true. Location cannot be beat. In summer weather, this place is perfect to walk to everything; from the market to the Space Needle and Westlake Center shopping. We stayed Friday to Tuesday am and the valet parking attendants (sorry, but I didn't catch names and hate to label, but there were two African American and one Somalian gentlemen, who were AWESOME!) Front desk was average at best. Looked asleep and the guy who checked us in didn't even tell us that you had to stick the key card into the slot in the elevator to make it go to your floor. After going back and forth, we figured it out...kinda funny. Our room was on the fourth floor facing out to Stewart and it's LOUD. I have stayed all over the country in every major city and this place is LOUD. If you stay here request a room on the other side, or you will never sleep. The walls are so paper thin that we could hear people talking (every word!), having sex (my 15-year old niece got educated.), and taking a shower at 2:00 am and hearing them drop the soap in the shower!!! Not lying...we turned on the window heater/air to drown out noise, but then that was like having an airplane hangar next to you...wow. This is like having your own little efficiency apartment in the middle of downtown Seattle. Yes, it is funky, the art is cool, but that lasts a minute and then you're like...oh no, this is loud and really small. If you are over 6 feet tall, you will have a difficult time using the bathroom. I'm not joking and I think our bathroom was larger than most. My knees almost hit the wall when going potty! The shower wouldn't drain (we asked twice for it to be fixed!) and so by the time you got out you had water ankle deep! Every day we had to ask for more toiletries, since there were three of us and we actually needed them! We weren't taking home for future use...didn't do that. Valet parking is $30, but since we rented a car and it was raining the entire trip, for us it was probably more cost effective, since we could come and go many times and not have to pay. The lot across the street was less expensive, but once you leave, that's it. So for us that could've been $100 easy a day! And the above mentioned valet guys were sweetie pies and talkative and made the whole stay! They should be at the front desk taking care of people...awesome! We ordered room service one night and it was horrible!!! So gross...ordered two sodas and they just slapped the dirty-topped cans on the tray with no glasses of ice.

We got on-line and noticed we could get a room in the $90 range. As we tend to be last minute planners, we decided to book directly with the hotel en-route. We called the hotel and said we wanted to book a room tonight and the front desk agent said that they couldn't book a room directly and we had to call the 800 reservations line. He transferred us and we sat outside the Hotel Max for 15 minutes on hold waiting for an agent to pick up. The door / valet knocked on our window and asked us if he could help us - and we told him what was going on. He said that was not normal and we should just go inside and check in and that the desk agent we spoke to must have been wrong. We went inside and met \"Brian\" at the desk. (Brian doesn't like his job) We said we would like to make a reservation for tonight and we saw on-line that there are rooms available and that they were available in the $90 range per night. Brian then began to tell us that he could not book a room at that price and we would have to pay $139. We pulled up our iPhone and showed him that we could book it right now in the lobby on one of the many hotel sites. He said that we could sit in his lobby and book it on-line, but that he wouldn't be able to honor the reservation - even with a confirmation number until the reservation linked with his - which would be over two hours. Snidely he said - do you want to do that or would you like to book the room now at $139. I said to Brian that the external OTA's charge quite a fee and that actually the hotel would be doing better if he would just honor that lowest rate guarantee and provide good customer service to us and the hotel would save $25 to $30 in room revenue. That is when Brian used the greatest service line ever - \"That's our policy\". The entire check-in process was cold and unprofessinal. When we asked \"tell us about this hotel\" he said, what do you want to know... we asked tell us about it - it is unique and we really don't know much about it. He said, It's a hotel that was taken over from the Vance hotel chain and that they feature art here. That really told us some great stuff \"Brian\". There was no description of the room we were going to go in, the services of the hotel and anything else hospitable. The room was cold, although clean, but did not feel we got the value out of the experience. We would not stay here again - unless you are seeking a rude experience as your stay and a mediocre room to sleep - super small rooms. As we were so impressed with the service - there was a huge disconnect as to why the property had so much strange pictures everywhere. It wasn't until we read in the room that this was designed to be \"artsy\" in decor with some unique and signature pieces that we understood the theme. I guess \"artsy\" means rude and unprofessional.

Didn't have much time to check online on what Hotel Max was like, so was a little surprised at first to see it was a small boutique hotel. No biggie! I caught a shared van from SeaTac airport to the Westin hotel, and walked a block up (saved more money than a curb-side drop off at Hotel Max!) The hotel hallways were pretty neat & really loved the artwork on the doors of the rooms. PROS: - The room size with a king bed was comfortable enough for me as a solo traveler - COMFORTABLE BED!!!! It's on the soft side, but I love it. There were plenty of pillows to go around, so that was nice too - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Quick 1 block walk to the shopping complex (forget the name) that has a Nordstrom/Barney's attached and other high-end stores - Starbucks across the street! - Walk to \"Pike Place Public Market\" wasn't too far. Around 10-15mins? - Friendly and helpful staff - Luggage storage for late departures out of Seattle - Check-out time was 12 noon I believe. Perfect! CONS: - Shower size: I'm a very petite 5'1\" and even I felt rather cramped while showering! You can easily bang on the walls if not careful..... so you feel rather restricted to shower (like on a cruise ship) - Sink area: While I like a glass bowl for a sink, it wasn't helpful at all for a female when it comes to washing my face. Easily get yourself wet! There was also a glass shelf directly above it, and while it's useful....it didn't help that when I lowered my head to wash my face, I could easily knock the top of my head on the shelf if I wasn't careful!!!! That would've been a big OUCH - No lighting in the area when you first walk in through the doors, and with gray-colored walls....it was pretty dark! Also no lighting in the closet so it was hard to see. There's ample lighting with 2 bedside lamps, a desk lamp and ceiling light above the bed....so it isn't too shabby - Room Temperature: The heater/AC system attached to the window is rather finicky to use. It's really loud when you turn it on for heat, but if you don't leave it on - the room gets cold really fast (esp for a winter's night). You can also feel a draft from the windows, so it didn't help. I had to turn off the heater at night because it was too loud, so I ended up slightly freezing but I did warm up underneath the covers - Can be a noisy room from the traffic during the day (especially)/night.

I'm not a huge guy, 5'9\", 155, and it was nearly impossible to stand in the shower without touching one of the walls.

The room itself is nicely appointed but TINY \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even by European standards. No real dresser to put clothes in and nowhere to sit except for the bed. There is a desk chair but really unusable due to the size of the room. Beds are very soft, which my girlfriend liked, but I woke up with a sore back both mornings we were there. The other off putting thing about the room aside from the size, was the main piece of artwork that appeared to be an abstract of a shirtless male with a ball gag in his mouth (see pic). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not prudes but not really into that either. On that note we chose not to purchase the $30 Intimacy Kit w/ \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Intimacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ring from the mini bar.

We booked a queen room and there was the bed with about 1 foot on either side and about 1.5 feet to the tiny little desk. The shower was basically a shower stall in a closet and the washroom was the size of a restroom stall in a gas station. Now we are not huge complainers, but the room almost had us in tears.

Travelling alone, I wasn't particularly concerned about room size, and had read reviews stating that the Max was quite small. The check-in process was speedy, and conducted by a very polite and attentive desk agent. Check-in time was to be 4:00, but I arrived around noon, and was worried I might not be able to check in early. I have had that problem in the past, but was pleased to find that my room was ready after my 12 hour flight, and all-together 16 hour journey. The room itself was a very clean, yet probably quite old room. The halls looked immaculate and new, but the best way I can describe the room, is an older room (walls, trim, floors, showers) with some stylish furniture ( bed, chair, desk, sink) and accents thrown in to cover that fact up. I imagine some would be less than pleased with this, but it didn't bother me at all. The bed was comfortable and clean. I had rotten sleeps on the bed, but that was likely jet-lag, and no indication of the bed itself as I have slept comfortably in far less comfortable beds. My only complaint was the window-unit heater/air-conditioner is incredibly noisy. I came from Japan where it was over 100 degrees some days to Seattles, cold and damp. I wasn't as well prepared as I would have like to have been, so I needed the heat... Loud as it was. The restaurant was great. I ate in the restaurant once, and ordered room service a few times when I was stuck inside doing work or conference calling. Surely not the best Seattle has to offer, but delicious nonetheless. The front desk staff, and the doormen were helpful, and attentive. A very good experience with customer service. All in all, I would recommend this place, and I'd go back again if I was going alone... With a spouse, or with a spouse and a child, it would be a tight fit in my Queen of Art room.

Memorable for the visual quality of the premises, but not the excellent experience. I feel as though the hotel is relying on the \"gimmick\" of being an \"art hotel\" to carry it. The main color scheme was red and black, huge printed photographs covered the room doors, and unique art hangs in each room. If this uniqueness were combined with thoughtful design and amenities, the hotel would truly be a treasure. Unfortunately, the art stands alone as the main recommending feature of the hotel. Outside of art, the theme of this hotel seems to be \"tiny.\" The elevators were tiny (fitting two, up to four people semi-comfortably.) In our \"artist king\" room, there was little space to move around the bed, though the bed itself was supremely comfortable, and linens were clean and luxurious. The toilet and sink were separate from the shower, and both rooms were tiny and spare, to the point of being obnoxious. There was barely enough space to turn around, and no counter space at all, just a small shelf below a small mirror, and a small sink below that. The towels were nothing special. There was a full-length mirror in the closet. At night, the lobby plays thumping techno music which spills into the street like a homing beacon, but does not carry up to the rooms. Front desk service was fine. Not stellar, but certainly polite and acceptable. We did not order room service. The cleaning staff was friendly, and doormen and valets were plentiful and personable. The attached restaurant, Redfin, is recommended. Where I was truly disappointed in Hotel Max was the daily fee for wireless internet in guest rooms. The exorbitant mini-bar I could overlook (toothbrush and paste $15? Really?) but the internet fee was a letdown. It's no fun to be \"nickel-and-dimed,\" especially at the price and quality level Hotel Max aspires to. All in all, the stay was perfectly fine.

The sink is a small stainless bowl with no cabinetry. Not a place to cool your heals; reminded me of a Tokyo sleeping \"pod\". I had read an older review regarding the noise generated by the a/c wall unit. Management responded that it was installing new units. I think ours was one of the newer ones. However, the room is so small that the unit, blowing on \"low\" was a major imposition on the space...making it feel even smaller. Finally, they charge $12/day for internet access.

The room and bathroom were very clean, smelled pleasant, and had complimentary Aveda hygiene products. Heating/AC worked great. I got a single-room package with free wi-fi and valet parking thrown in for free (generally there is a charge), but the valet parking is definitely worth the price quoted.

Desk staff was polite, efficient, and forgiving of my strange requests, schedule, and demeanor upon check-in. I did not eat at the restaurant, but whatever they made for dinner smelled great in the lobby. Fun things: - The door to each room is an enlarged photo on some theme, each floor has it's own theme. - The mini-bar contains an interesting assortment of items, aside from the $8 bag of peanuts and $5 water. Let's put it this way: if you bring a date back, you won't need to travel far for \"sundries.\" Also other fun and interesting items. - If a Gideon NIV Bible isn't your style, you can choose from a \"menu\" of spiritual books from most major (and minor) world religions, and have it brought to your room. - You can order special pillows at no additional charge if needed.

I finally have decided to say something about this little \"Gem\" of a hotel as I stay here averagely 15 to 20 times a year for work. From the outset, this is a the cute, stylistic, central and convenient hotel when need to be in the city. The hotel has a young feel without being \"Stoosh\", void of being pretentious. Staff know me by name, so it's always good to come back, and staff always greet guests and help arrange anything needed in the city, the guys at the front desk always seem to be good with questions, or arranging cars. Well, the most important things are the rooms. The rooms come in Solo Art, Queen of Art and the Artist King, together with twin rooms. The solo being the smallest is small, but a good size, and a little larger than NYC rooms that say small. The Queen, is comfy, and depending on where on each floor, sometimes has a little more space. If you do want a peaceful night, ask for a room away from the lift, as the noise can sometimes grate when you need to rest. Included in all rooms are a work desk, fridge, with drinks of the usual sort, red and white wines, confection like mini Oreo's, Snicker's & assorted dried & coated nuts, be careful, a touch pricey! Across the road is everything you need, and being in town there's no excuse if saving your personal spend, or work spend on a $4.50 bottle of spring water. The bed is a dream to sleep on, firm to sleep on, and wide with 500 thread cotton. The great thing about this place it gives you an assortment of pillows, and if needed, you can request pillows if you have allergies, and a selection from the spiritual menu for your reading choice. There is a small gym, which is super clean with the basic's needed, 2 tread mills, 2 bikes, and a Nordic Ski, together with weights. A water cooler and fresh green apples are also provided. The cute factor is that every room has art from local artist's which are for sale if you are interested, together photography on the walls lining each floor and door to your room in B+W.. Even the room keys have alternating pictures represented on the walls of the floor. Room service is provided from the restaurant down stair's which is \"Blue Fin\". Fish in Seattle is great, and here is another good example. The thing that really is worth it, is the Sushi Happy Hour, that really last's a lot longer than a hour, firstly, early evening, then again 10:00pm til closing. Overall, a good place to stay for business, couples & families with teens. With Nordstroms being one minute away, and the rest of down town, you cant beat this for location. Prices for rooms are an average $139 plus tax, to $200, but keep an eye out for deal's all over as offer's seem to pop up to fill rooms within 2 weeks of a check-in date.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here the rooms tiny and the service is horrid!\u201d", "Author": "colonyhkman", "ReviewID": "UR57591722", "Content": "I always look for a boutique hotel to stay in when I travel.

Most reviews are not objective or people give low ratings, due to one bad incident. So, I am going to try to be as objective as possible, so any readers looking to stay here, can make an educate decision and feel comfortable about it. The worst thing is to be away from home in a crappy hotel. Location is great, 2 blocks from Pike st, you can walk everywhere. The street that the hotel is on, is a bit desserted. There are no shops and at night, there were no people walking, however 1 block away, there was tons of action. Value wise, you can beat it. Most hotels that call themselves boutiques, are usually a dump. You hang a copy of someone's artwork and there you go, boutique. I can say, that I was pleasantly pleased with the MAX. The building itself, must have been offices in the past. The hallways are narrow, but well kept. The room I was given, was a corner room. It is a bit small for 2 people, but since I was traveling solo this time around. It was fine for me. You might want to ask, prior to booking if the room types can fit 2 people comfortably. Also know that my room had no seating area. There's a king bed, flat screen TV and a desk, that I haven't used. The closet and bathroom are small, so my luggage will not fit on the luggage stand inside (I never unpack, fearful of bed bugs). and if you have a big bag, you'll have it sitting out. Again, for me as a solo business traveler, it suited my needs. Value wise, the cost was less than 140 per night. You can't beat it, since my regular hotel I stay at, was well over 245 a night. In regards to comfort, the bed is great. Soft and big and I had no complaints. I was well rested, when I woke up this morning. Overall, I would certainly stay here again.

Next the not-so-good: last time we received complimentary water and little chocolates along with a personal note from the manager, this time nothing and no mention that we were returning guests. The room was freezing cold and heated by a tiny, noisy window sill unit. The housekeeping staff bizarrely removed everything not hung up and didn't replace it, so that on the second night we had no facecloths, no new toiletries, no bathmat and only one robe.

Pros: 1. Location - we were within walking distance of just about everything we wanted to do in Seattle - the Aquarium, Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle, the Experience Music Project/Scifi Museum, and countless little shops and restaurants. 2. Style/Aesthetics - this is a very hip little hotel, great decor, artwork and ambiance (including the music in the lobby). We also had a nice view of downtown from the 10th floor. 3. Service - the attendants at the front desk were helpful and polite. 4. Sushi Restaurant - the restaurant/bar attached to the hotel was oustanding - excellent food and drink at good prices. They have a great happy hour from 4-6 every day. Cons: 1. Size - the rooms are not big at all, and the bathroom and shower are pretty tiny. Really, the rooms are about the size you'd typically find on a cruise ship. My wife typically gets ready for the day before I do, which is fortunate because we would not have been able to at the same time due to limited bathroom/counter space. 2. Wi-Fi - costs about $12 per 24 hours. 3. Clutter - it's such a small room to begin with, and way too much space is taken up by food/drink/t-shirts that Hotel Max is trying to sell you. The refrigerator was completely full - since we had our own food and drinks from Pike's Place Market, we had to empty the fridge first. The bedside table also had a tray of these items, which we just moved under the desk. 4. Phone - Local phone calls are a dollar - is that normal for hotels in Seattle? Overall, we enjoyed our stay although I think if we return to Seattle we might try our luck with one of the other hotels in the area.

With that said lets start with the do's and dont's of Hotel Max. Do... Book here if you want to be in great walking distance to downtown attractions Book here if you plan to ride the light rail from the airport into town and not rent a car Request to upgrade to a king room if possible Pack the thermal pajamas if your not traveling in the summer Read the literature in your room regarding the new instructions how to get fresh towels daily. Dont... Get a room near the elevator Plan to run laps in your shower as you wont get very far Book a queen room Bother with the starbucks next door to the lobby go to TULLYS Travel with children to this hotel Pay full price, find a deal on a discount website Alright Hotel Max is a quirky little hotel located in the DT area of Seattle which is a simple walk to anything near pike street, the needle, and or public transportation. I arrived by plane at SeaTac and decided i was going to ride the light rail into town as parking a car is anywhere from 20-30 a night at a hotel which is ridiculous. The light rail was $5 and got me from the airport all the way within 1.5 blocks of Hotel Max in 15-20 minutes (lovely). Check it was easy as i booked on Priceline and everything was already prepaid on my card for $70 a night which was a sweet deal for the location. Good luck finding anything as clean and this close to everything for the price... you wont. The elevator yeah thats um FUN i guess, two people with small roller bags and this bad boy is FULL and tight. If your \"husky\" or your luggage is bigger than you are then you might want to try the one and a time thing as i swear its only a matter of time before that thing stops moving. Up to the room and i booked a queen... the room was very small but managable with a separate shower and latrine rooms. The bed was comfortable and the majority of the room was fairly clean for the age of the building which was nice. Ill tell you now though if you do not like the noise of a city street then you might want to get a room toward the rear as cars will be passing constantly. The second night i requested to be moved up to a king which they did at no charge because of occupancy being extemely low which was nice. the king was MUCH larger but the bathrooms stayed about the same size, no big deal as your not suppose to be stuck in the bathroom for more than a quick doodoo or shower. The business center came in handy when i was looking for addresses to the places i wanted to go and eat from TA informants. And the staff was very helpful with the navigation of the public transportation as many of them ride it into work themselves (common in Seattle). The restaurant Red Fin Sushi was ok as they had a happy hour late night which was nice because much stuff in Seattle closes early and the happy hour started at 10pm so that was a plus. The funky decor of the hotel that everybody talks up is boarderline too much in the lobby with some of the colors and textures being used but the subtle style in the rooms and the artwork on the doors is an interesting touch. If i went back to Seattle i would stay here again as there was no real bad experience from this place other than the small bathroom, that didnt really cause a problem on my own trip.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice but cold\u201d", "Author": "FussyTravellerSof", "ReviewID": "UR48648164", "Content": "Hello, it's Nov 6 and I'm in my room working and looking at the only source of heat - one of those very noisy heating fans attached to the window.

The Westin was only mildly more expensive for the extra 1/2-star, and worth the upgrade to us in terms of space and staffing. Check-in at the Max was FOREVER with only 2 staffers and a firm check-in time (4pm). Might have been quicker if early-travelers had been given rooms first-come, first-serve. Valet Parking had the same problem. Truly, I recommend not driving in Seattle anyway since public transport is so great and the city is very walkable if you are in reasonable shape. Need another reason? How about valet-only parking at $30/nt? This was the most expensive and worst service we found in the area. Only 1 or 2 valets working the garage, so give yourself at least 15-20 mintues to get the car (in fairness, we noticed valets going on break with 2-3 couples still waiting for their cars--this was brought to the attention of management and very promptly corrected). Hotel Max was well-decorated and interesting, but the rooms had a dorm-room quality. We are small people and still had a tough time maneuvering around the room together. On the positive, the adjacent restaurant had amazing sushi rolls and martinis, we had a great view of the Space Needle from the room, the elevators were really cool (but don't forget your room key: you need it to use the lift), and the entire hotel was certainly designed well to maximize the space (or lack thereof). If you just need a place to sleep in the best shopping area near City Centre, within a brisk walk to Pike's Place Market, you're not driving around the city, and you'd rather take a shower than bathe, this hotel is unique enough to stay near the top of the list.

I reserved a room with two queen beds (visited for two nights with my sister) and got a better rate by pre-paying (about $160-$170/night) a couple of months in advance. Of course, this didn't cover the parking (they only do valet) which was an extra $30/day or internet access ($12/day). I know this is typical in large cities, but it doesn't make it any easier to swallow. Once you factor in all of the misc. taxes, you're well over $200/night even when you've gotten a \"deal.\" I might not have minded if the rooms were worth it, but our room was TINY. I could barely find a place for my suitcase. There wasn't even a chair, just two queen beds and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was even worse. -A small stand-up shower and a sink that was not even big enough to wash your face in. What's more, you had to step up to get inside, and there wasn't room to move once you did. I mentioned this upon check-out and was told that a room with a tub and shower (i.e., larger bathroom) could be requested if I ever were to return (not likely). The room also did not seem very clean, the street traffic was very noisy and the 'mini bar' items looked like they were 50 years old. The location was decent, though I'm not sure you could walk to the Space Needle (we didn't have time to find out).

The Hotel Max had very similar friendly, laid-back service, which we enjoyed. Some luxury hotels have such solicitous service that it makes me uncomfortable. The Hotel Max strikes a good balance. The location is pretty good. We are walkers, so perhaps we're less picky on that front. We were close to shopping, public transit, and walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go except a kayaking trip - and then we just took a bus. The rooms however, are small. Our room was microscopic. I had requested a corner room, which we got, but I had done so assuming it would be a LARGER room. It was, instead, a smaller room. My husband even called the day before we were due to arrive to double-check on our room assignment. He specifically told them we were most concerned about the room SIZE, and they assured us that we were in their largest room. Well, I saw other rooms when the doors were open and they were being cleaned. I did not see a room SMALLER than ours. Yes, we did have more windows, which was nice, but I just didn't feel like the staff was completely up front with us when we called. Especially since we called SPECIFICALLY out of concern for room size. That said, the staff was always friendly and ready to help. We had a clogged sink and mentioned it on our first morning on our way out to breakfast. It was fixed by the time we came back an hour later. They left the drain cleaner behind, but at least it was fixed! Upon checkout, they also charged us for parking (and we didn't have a car). They fixed it quickly and were apologetic, but if I hadn't checked the receipt, I would have been out an extra $100! Rooms were cleaned well and the bed linens were of a much higher quality than in most hotels. I will say one thing for the small size of the rooms.

The downside? For the price, it's not a great value overall--location is ok not great, below par service, noisey heat/cooling unit, expensive parking, much room-to-room noise, and hip decor misses the mark inside the actual room. To confirm other posts--the hotel caters to the youngish and conference crowds, has small euro-style bathrooms, and separate shower room/closet. My husband and I stayed there for three nights. If it had been a whole week, we would have changed hotels. It took a good 25 minutes to check-in with only two couples ahead of us. The sole front desk person apologized, and said it was the weekend so they only had a small staff (it was a Saturday). We were semi-ok with the answer, seeing that it's a small hotel and he genuinely was overwhelmed. Now, I will tell you a story that is not to be believed. My husband was locked inside the bathroom because the doorknob jammed from the inside (it kept rotating without catching). He was locked in the bathroom for 15-20 minutes, until I returned to the room and let him out. We visited the frontdesk and explained the problem. The response, \"What room are you in? Oh, we told \"them\" to fix that, but I guess they didn't. We'll have someone attend to it.\" And, for the second time we heard, \"It's the weekend so we're kinda short on staff.\" I like to think I am a forgiving person, but are you for real? A truly nice, responsible hotel does not KNOWINGLY turn over a room with a faulty bathroom lock that could leave its patron locked in his/her bathroom for an indefinite period of time. If our room was booked by a single traveler, they would have been stuck in that small bathroom until someone, presumably the cleaning crew, discovered her/him. Aside from that (hopefully unusual) occurance, our stay was ordinary which was a disappointment because you do get a good vibe when you enter the hotel lobby. My recommendation--save your money and go to a less swanky hotel or spend a little extra somewhere else. BTW - HotelMax should take a lesson or two from its Portland sister.

People seem to complain about the size of the room, and to be honest they are small, but if you've traveled a lot outside the States they are not that small (especially compared with Europe, Japan, Hong Kong etc). What is an issue is the lack of soundproofing between rooms, but it was only a problem with a room on one side. It probably just the way the original rooms have been subdivided and the partition wall was paper thin. We were tired and didn't hear them until we woke the next morning. The room was freezing because the air con/heater unit wasn't sealed into the window properly - very poor. Another strange thing was that the toilet/sink and shower were essentially in separate cupboards - an issue if you are claustrophobic (not all the rooms are like this).

Though I understand that it is the hotel's policy, it really should be posted online when making a reservation or referred to by the fron desk upon check-in. We were unaware of it until after we had checked in, and the additional hold on my credit card was very inconvenient.

Caught me a bit off gaurd, but didnt mind it. Front desk was avaliable and checked me in.

My room itself consisted of a King size bed (which was EXTREMELY comfortable). Didn't want to leave the warm room and track out in the 30degree cold. As soon as you walk in you see the bathroom, which was a bit small. The counter in the bathroom is long (stainless steel-ish) but the width is NADA.....couldn't fit much.

I arrived early, a good 4 hours before official check-in time, but they accommodated me right away with a nice corner room on the 2nd floor. My key card didn't work on my first trip up, but the clerk was really helpful and got me all figured out quickly. The room is pretty small, as most other reviewers pointed out, but I found it just fine for me. Being on a corner allowed for lots of windows and lots of light, but one side faced an office building so I had to keep the blinds on one window closed while I was in the room. The bed was really comfortable and the desk area with the TV was set up to be really user friendly. The flat screen TV appears to be a little old and depending on what channel I was on, the picture kind of came and went. I didn't watch too much TV so it didn't bother me that much. The window heating/cooling system was a little odd, and I couldn't seem to find the right temperature- if I turned it off, it was freezing in the room, but with it on, it got pretty toasty in the room. I'm sure if I had the patience, I could've come to some kind of happy medium, but I preferred to just throw on the robe and get under the covers. The bathroom was ok- I had to step up into the bathroom, and not just a little step, it was a pretty decent sized step up. The bathroom floor is some kind of VERY cold tile and since I couldn't figure out the room temperature, my feet froze each time I went into the bathroom. Again, not a huge deal, just something I had to get used to. The outlet in my bathroom also required some effort, as each time I plugged something in, I had to push the reset button on the outlet. It had to be pushed HARD to reset and I actually had to get the pencil off the desk to reset it a couple of times. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is really only a very thin glass counter to keep your bathroom belongings on, so I ended up using the nightstand to keep my make-up, etc. Bonus points for the Aveda bathroom products though!! Being on the 2nd floor was helpful in that I was right on the same floor as the hotel gym. It was pretty nicely appointed for a small hotel with 2 ellipticals, 2 treadmills, free weights, a weight bench, exercise ball and mats. All machines were hooked up to a \"cardio theater\" so I could catch up on some Law & Order while I worked out. I ate at the hotel restaurant, Red Fin, for an early dinner and was able to order off of their Happy Hour menu so dinner only came to about $10 and was enough to tide me over for the evening. I know they also serve breakfast and lunch but I opted to explore the area for those meals instead. Check-out is at noon and since I was still in town for a few hours, they let me store my suitcase there so I could continue to walk around the city. The Hotel Max is in a great location and is close to everything!! I recommend staying here, but maybe upgrading to a king room would give you a little more space if you are in town for more than a couple of days.

The two things that bothered me about it were that #1- it was terribly loud and #2 there was no \"auto fan\" function. It was either on or off. Besides that, it provided the heat that the room needed, so it was fine. The bathroom was oddly a step up, which caused more than a couple of middle of the night slips. It was small, but no smaller than what is customary for a boutique hotel. It had a small shower, which for me (265 lbs) was a bit of a squeeze, a toilet, and a sink. Again, all expected for a small boutique hotel. The staff was outstanding. Always smiling and courteous. The valet people were very responsive and as I mentioned, I didn't have to wait longer than 10 minutes to get my car. The lobby desk staff was very helpful, making sure I was accommodated in any way I needed. The hotel has an in-building restaurant called \"Red Fin\" which I did not go to, but it looked nice. My thought was that for as close as the hotel was to Pike's Place, why not take in the local culture for a lot less money? The location of the Hotel could not be beat. It was a block or two from the monorail station which took you straight to the Space Needle for $2 a person each way. It was about 5 blocks (7 minute walk) from Pike's Place Market and really in the heart of a bunch of great seattle shopping and eating. In conclusion, this hotel is certainly worth the price I paid for it for the Location alone! The room was comfortable and clean, though a bit on the small side. The staff was prompt and courteous.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "babeyange", "ReviewID": "UR24650334", "Content": "This Saturday was Valentine's Day and I thought it would be romantic to stay at what seems to be an unbelievable hotel with my boyfriend. After my boyfriend worked a ten hour shift he was surprised when he was checking in that the front desk clerk refused to give him the room we booked because \"it is 21 and older only\". My boyfriend and I are both 19, and we have never had an issue booking a room while traveling. After an argument stating that we obviously did not know this prior to booking the hotel, he finally got the room. It was not stated on the Max hotel website, nor on any review websites did I browse prior to booking that the hotel 21 and older only. I would assume it was because of those infamous mini fridges that are jam packed full of heavily priced liquor, but you can lock those or just remove them. When I arrived to meet my boyfriend, he was extremely upset because he had to fight for so long with the clerk. I did not know this, so I smiled and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good evening!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the clerk, it was late and I am a waitress so I try to treat others in the customer service department kindly. I was surprised when the clerk gave me a dirty look, turned and starting walking away. He went to talk to another employee and I am assuming the things he was saying were uncalled for. I have worked in the hotel business and I personally have never seen such a thing. I was so appalled that a hotel clerk would be so rude, especially since we were staying in one of the most expensive rooms. I am not picky when it comes to hotels, to be frank. But that really infuriated me, and disappointed me as well. For a person who seems like they were in their mind twenties, it was such a lack of maturity. I was afraid to call in the morning and order breakfast because I did not want my food being spat in by the rude employee. Other than that employee, I did enjoy a few things. It was a perk to have such a wonderful and extremely comfortable bed. I was surprised to find the bathroom and shower both located in closet like rooms. I did not mind too much, but my boyfriend who was very upset about the argument with the front desk clerk did. The art work that was printed on every door was lovely too. I am not sure if I will ever come to this hotel again. Perhaps if new personal is hired, I may consider it in a few years.

Our main reason for choosing it was its proximity to the Convention Centre where my husband was attending a conference. After booking our package on Travelocity, I emailed the hotel to make some enquiries. I was pleased when a member of their Maxtini staff, Kathleen, very quickly replied to answer my questions and make suggestions. Not a one line general answer either but a carefully thought out reply that laid out options for my ease. We arrived in the evening and were checked in fairly quickly. We were assured that we had one of their larger Queen Art rooms. The room was small but manageable if you are not planning on being in the room all the time. The shower cubicle was tiny but the Aveda products were a nice touch. Our room was right next to the elevator which was not much of a problem except for the first night when it was really a disturbance and made it difficult for me to sleep. I mentioned it to Kathleen who immediately offered to change our room and showed us 2 options which we declined because they were even smaller. As many others have commented, there is art all over the hotel and some are pretty funky pieces. There is a book in your room which tells you the history and background of the art and artists. They also have a pillow menu which we thought was cute. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. One of the front desk staff, Henry, helped us with all our reservations for both dinner and tours. On another occasion one of the doormen, unfortunately I forget his name, tried very hard to help me locate a mobile phone charger as I had forgotten mine. The downtown location is perfect and easily accessible. An easy walk to just about everywhere - the Convention Centre, Pacific Plaza, monorail station, retail stores, Pike`s Market etc. Very convenient especially if you are in town without a car. Also a quick walk to the Westin where you can take the Downtown Airporter to the airport for about $11. There is a Starbucks (of course!) right next to the hotel for those who need their caffeine fix and complimentary Internet access in the business centre. Overall, a great stay with good service and value. I`d definitely recommend it.

The art all over the hallways on our floor was very cool. 2)The shower I took the next morning felt incredible and I was really surprised because the night before when we first got into the room, we were dissapointed that the shower was a standing stall and not a tub. But the shower head is one of those good kinds. And there were nice Aveda bath products. I was very pleased because Aveda is an eco-friendly company and they make amazing products.3) The hotel rooms at the Max are supposedly European styled, meaning smaller sized rooms, but we were fortunate enough to get one of the bigger sized rooms with a queen. 4) Last of all, when I checked out, the guy at the front desk was very friendly on the phone, because I had some problems with my bill which I will mention after this, and he was very helpful and trying to help me find a resolution. Ok, now the bad things about this hotel: 1)Checking in, there was only one person behind the desk. We did check in late around 7pm but still.He was on the phone when I arrived. And he could have been a little bit friendlier, ( aren't all hotel staff usually super friendly?) 2) Using room service to order food from the restaurant next door, The Red Fin, was not the best because the restaurant must have forgotten about the beer I ordered. And what's weird is that some lady had called me from the restaurant and told me they were out of the kind I had ordered and so I had given her an alternative option which she said they had. But when our food came, the beer was missing. And I had to call the hotel two times on the phone to see what was going on. The guy (I think the same check in guy?) told me the first time I didn't have an order for the beer that I had told the restaurant lady I'd have instead. Then he had a question for me about our room service restaurant bill and said the total my boyfriend put didn't match the tip and the rest of the bill. (And so you know, the 18% they automatically add for you goes to the restaurant, so there is an empty spot on the receipt for you to tip the person who actually brings you the food.) But the guy on the phone said they'd figure out the bill and we hung up. But as I was eating the food with my boyfriend (and we were pleased with the food), I realized that when I called the hotel about my missing beer, I had mentioned the beer that was the second choice, and maybe the hotel didn't know about how the lady from the restaurant had called me to ask me if I wanted a different kind , and so I pressed 0 on the phone and asked him if there was an order for the beer that I had originally asked for. And he said there was not an order for any beer. And I was pretty polite both times, and this time around, I said ok, thank you, and he just hung up on me! He didn't even apologize again or say bye, which made me feel like I was annoying for calling them again, wondering where that beer that I was looking forward to enjoying was during my supposedly leisurely stay there. And I could have ordered it again because he did ask the first time if I wanted to order it again but I said it was ok, because I'd have to wait again, and would there be another bill added for another room service? Who knows? I'm sure I could have demanded that it was complimentary since it was not my fault that they forgot my beer. But I didn't want to do all that. I just wanted to enjoy a beer with my food and have a relaxing night with my boyfriend. Well, turns out I just drank a beer from the mini bar in the room which I didn't mind paying 6 bucks for because I didn't have to wait for that beer. I should have just done that from the start but I wasn't aware that they had a kind I liked in the mini bar and I didn't know if the beers in the room were outrageously priced. Anyways, sitting on the hotel bed, watching cable tv was very relaxing, the bed was very comfortable and there were a bunch of pillows, and there was this smaller sized pillow that was just the perfect size for me to hold while watching tv. But when I tried to sleep later on, it was not a pleasant experience at all for me. The pillows were absolutely hard and yes, the hotel does have some pillow menu which sounds cool, but I really didn't want to call 2 am and ask for a different kind, especially after that earlier encounter on the phone. I felt like I was sleeping on a dictionary, really! All the pillows were hard, and my boyfriend later told me they were down pillows or something, but they were not the type of pillows for me, maybe some people like them, but I didn't. So I was tossing and turning the whole night, and to make it worse, the heater in the room was very loud. And if you turned it off, the room got freezing cold. So I turned it back on, and it was just so loud, I couldn't sleep.It was some kind of older type heater things that was positioned in front of the window. And you know what else? Our room was next to the elevator and I should have known better because all night, ALL NIGHT, there were sounds coming from the hallways and at first, I thought it was the housekeeper driving the cleaning cart around and maybe banging into the walls or something (that's what it sounded like), but my boyfriend later told me it was probably the elevator next door. If you get room #701, maybe you should ask for a different room! My boyfriend did actually sleep and supposedly slept good too, but he got really drunk the previous night, so of course he slept good! Ok, so the last things I will mention is, after getting only about 4 hours of sleep total with many noisy interruptions in between during this supposedly leisurely getaway from home, when it was check out time, I called the hotel from our room phone to confirm check out. It was a different guy this time and he was actually very friendly! The guy told me the bill total and I asked him what the total was for the room service and it was higher than I expected, so I asked him if there was a mistake. And what do you know, it turns out that the guy who had brought the food to us must have changed the tip amount my boyfriend had written in because it was now a higher amount, and that is why the night before, the other guy on the phone had mentioned an inconsistency with the bill total. But the friendly guy on the phone this time told me we could contact the restaurant and see what they wanted to do about it,but I decided it was not worth the wait, and told him that the guy could have a nice tip (even if he did change the amount himself, which is very wrong, but what the heck, he must really need it to have to change it), and the check out guy asked me if I was sure, and I said yes. Oh, and when I stood outside for my car to be brought up by valet, it took way too long. I was standing there for a while. This hotel definitely needs work in some areas and definitely could be better. Some of their staff needs better training or hiring choices should be better (valet shouldn't take so long, some staff should be friendlier, and someone definitely shouldn't be writing in different amount tips for themselves on the room service receipts. ) Maybe second time around will be better, if there will ever be a second time? The only reason I might consider this hotel again is because I saw last time on their website that they have cool little packages like one coming up for Valentine's Day where they will have rose petals put on the bed for you. That sounds really cool, but I don't know if I'm willing to take another risk and hope for a flawless experience? The last place I stayed at was the Marriott-Waterfront in Seattle, and this was definitely a downgrade. But I should have known better when I knew I was paying $135 for a room.

Since there's no sitting space, you're forced to spend the day sitting in your bed. The bathroom and shower are extremely small and separate from each other. They converted a closet into a shower. The bed linens were old and uncomfortable. My biggest complaint about this room was the temperature. There was a window unit that wasn't regulated by temperature. When it was on, it got really hot and stuffy; and if you turned it off, it got really cold because the windows are poorly sealed. So there's no happy median for the temperature On my second night, I asked to move to a king room. It was a little better. The room was a bit larger and more like a normal room.

Reasonably, I put a credit card down and they placed the hold. However, two hours later when I was resting in the room cleaning staff came in and emptied out all incidentals. So, now I didn't have anything in the room and the charge was on my card. The room itself was crowded and VERY small (compared to similar boutiques in San Francisco) with a knob window heater (opposed to a digital one that moderates the temperature). I'm native to Minnesota so found Seattle to be fairly temperate in comparison so this wasn't a huge deal, but might be a a factor for someone coming from a warmer climate-- or someone that doesn't want to wake up roasting/freezing. Eventually the room felt more \"cozy\" instead of \"cramped\", but it did take some getting used to. The decor is entertaining. There were multiple occasions in the three days I was there that my room became very smoky, likely from a nearby smoking room. Opening the window solved the problem. I could also hear my neighbors talking normally in the other room. On the positive side, the art on the doorways in stunning and the hotel certainly has personality. The front desk was friendly, knowledgeable and competent. They have a free business center with high speed internet and printers. Their location is prime for walking to most parts of the city.

I was on a trip with my best friend and we had an \"Art of Two Beds\" room on the 5th floor. Both of us were used to the more \"traditional\" hotels like Marriott and Sheraton so when we first walked in we were a little taken aback at the decor, but in a good way. The hotel is very modern, from the furniture to the fixtures to the art. The doors to the rooms are covered with a black and white photo (ours had a guartist from Pearl Jam) and each floor represents a different photographer. Everywhere there is local art being displayed which gives the hotel a funky feel. The staff was very helpful from start to finish. Because it's not your stereotypical chain hotel the staff tends to have more personality and interacts a little better with the guests. Any questions we had they answered and they even played around and had fun with us. The bathrooms were very small - my friend who has traveled around Europe said they were the size of the ones in Paris or on a cruise ship. Functional, yes. Spacious, no. We ended up blow drying our hair in the room itself. The beds were comfy and the pillow selection assures that you'll have a good nights sleep. Fair warning though, because this is a converted old building the soundproofing is not the best. We could hear the busses going up and down Stewart all night long (didn't keep us up or wake us up but could be heard clearly) and when other guests arrived later in the night you could hear them in the hallway through the door. I also got to experience a new bride and groom celebrating their wedding night the first night there thanks to the lack of soundproofing. When I inquired at the front desk the following day if our neighbors were going to be around that night (and explained what I had heard 6 different times throughout the night) they asked me why I didn't call down there and have them inform the guests. I had assumed that there was nothing the front desk could do but I was apparently wrong - another plus to the Hotel Max. Overall, the only downsides to the hotel were the small elevators and bathrooms and the lack of soundproofing but none of those things would keep me from staying there again. It was a quick 20 minute walk to the Space Needle, 10 minutes to the waterfront/Pike Place Market and one block from the Grayline airport shuttle stop. Great location, great hotel.

When we arrived we were greeted by an unsmiling receptionist who informed us, without apology that all four of our rooms had been cancelled because we had been expected the day before. I showed him the reservation that confirmed we had arrived as per the booking and he silently began tapping on his keyboard. Eventually he got rooms for two of us but said the other two would have to go in smoking rooms. After some discussion later he found two non-smoking rooms for us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although they were queens instead of kings. Our rooms were all hellishly tiny (two king and two queen). I had a medium-sized suitcase and the only place I could open it without blocking the exit to my room was on my bed. There was literally just enough space to walk around the bed. The bathroom was just as disappointing. The shelf is so slim, it barely held my washbag. After it fell off twice, I took to storing it on the floor. The best thing about the bathroom is the Aveda products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although they appear to be in scarce supply as none of mine were replaced during the three night trip. We had three parcels delivered to the Hotel a few days before our arrival. The porter could not find them and announced they were not in the building. I showed him proof that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been delivered and after some coaxing he emerged with one package. I pressed him to find the second, which he eventually did. When he could not find the third, I offered to come to the post room to help him. I immediately spotted my package in front of the door and clearly labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it had been opened. No apologies, just shoulder shrugging. Breakfast on day one was a bizarre experience. The Japanese-style restaurant looks very nice in the evening but the bizarre thumping music did not seem very appropriate at 7am. In the lobby the restaurant was advertising pancakes but the waiter informed me they were out (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love the recipe because to my knowledge there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many exotic ingredients in a pancake). Curiously the restaurant was almost empty every morning. I ordered room service one evening and placed my tray outside the room afterwards because I did not wish to be disturbed. I was more than surprised to see it still outside the door 22 hours later when I returned the next evening. As I checked out I was ready to tell the receptionist about my experience but she just handed me my receipt without asking how my stay was.

Why I wouldn't stay again Unfortunately I can't recommend to anyone to stay here again all the positives I listed above were outweighed by the lack of soundproofing and temperature control. We had a corner room which no doubt put us in a better position, but we could hear everything from our neighbors room next door, everything. It was like they were in the room with us! We didn't mind the city noise that is what you would expect staying downtown, but I had couple sleepless nights because of talking, laughter and such that came right through the wall. The heating and cooling of the room (as far as we could tell) was controlled exclusively by a unit mounted in the window, so when it was cold (all the time) we turned on the heat (very loud) when it got too hot we turned it off. Recommendations to the hotel would be: install heat/cooling units with automatic temperature shut off so that you can keep your room at a comfortable temperature without having to constantly adjust the unit (especially useful when sleeping!). During the renovations to turn this building into a hotel they should have invested more in soundproofing the walls.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cIs there a term better than AWESOME?\u201d", "Author": "mvanatta", "ReviewID": "UR14364003", "Content": "Awesome.

Upon arriving at the restaurant that evening, we were told that when the hotel called to make our reservations, they also wanted us to have a complimentary appetizer.

Originally, we wanted to stay at the W Hotel or the Westin. However, by the time I got around to making the reservation, those prices had shot up over $300/night. So I came across the Hotel Max. I read some reviews about it and they were pretty mixed. Some people complained about the tiny rooms, unsanitary conditions, the two gals canoodling on the lobby sofa (get over it!). With the understanding that you just can't please everyone, and a room rate of about $140/nite, we decided to give it a try and got the Queen of Art room. We rented a car at Sea-Tac and drove into town. We pulled up to the front of the hotel, registered and passed car keys on. The hotel is housed in an older building, but completely modern throughout. The lobby ceilings are coved with detailing, the only obvious evidence of a former life. The lobby, room doors and room interiors have lots of very interesting art on/in them. Our room was larger than I was prepared for. Everything looked very clean and the color palate was very attractive. Flat screen TV was nice touch too. The bathroom is quite small, and the shower stall is even smaller. The bed was very comfortable and on par with Heavenly beds. Don't expect much for views. We had a view of the top of a small building and the smoking garden of a nearby high-rise condo. We were awakened by screeching seagulls both mornings, but they moved on after a few minutes. Our room was right next to the elevators. We never heard people talking (place is actually very quiet), but we could hear the cables of the car going up and down. My advice is to get a room further away from elevators. The hotel has a restaurant/bar called Red Fin right next door. It's a very cool entrance from the lobby. There is a dark wall that has art on it. On the far left, there is a tall stainless handle attached the wall. It is actually the door into Red Fin that is integrated into the wall. Red Fin was pretty good. Very cool interior, with selection of tables, sushi bar and high bar tables. Nice music playing, not too loud. I believe they have a live band for Sunday brunch. They serve decent sushi/rolls and nice, elegant cocktails. We stopped in there after a late dinner for a cocktail and again for a pre-dinner nosh and cocktail. Prices are reasonable. Hotel Max is not for everyone, but we saw a very nice mix of people there: straight, gay, young, all races, families, girls' weekend, etc. The location is hard to beat (Stewart/7th). We were a block from the new light rail, 2 blocks from great shopping, a nice walk to the Market, and tons of restaurants and bars down on 1st Ave. (Belltown). I wasn't bothered by the small bath that much, but we were only there 2 nights and rarely spent much time in our room. My biggest complaint is the parking situation. We got dressed and ready for dinner and we headed down to get our car. No one could find our car and we waited over 25 minutes for them to track down. At checkout the next morning, it was even worse. The valets were running around like crazy looking for cars, parking cars, forgetting to give people their keys after checkout, etc. It was like watching the keystone cops. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our car. Apparently they have 2 lots (one behind hotel and one offsite). It's not really clear to them in which lot the car ended up. We were very cool about it, but some people showed their displeasure. At a rate of $30/day for hotel guest parking, they need to do a better job of keeping track of people's cars. The manager on duty that morning, Alyssa, was exceptional. Even with all the buzz of people checking out and in, she had her eye out for us, making sure the valets were on the hunt for our car. Finally, she came out from behind the desk to personally apologize for the situation and offered to adjust our bill to take off the parking. I thought that was very classy and probably earned our business again in the future. I would definitely recommend this fun, friendly, artsy hotel with a hard-to-beat location, at reasonable prices. I would say rent a car at your own risk. Hopefully, they'll have figured out a better parking system by then.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, wa", "Title": "\u201cTiny\u201d", "Author": "malisam71", "ReviewID": "UR14081251", "Content": "Just a warning before you go.

We checked in really late (around 1am) that night and the front desk receptionist (guy)'s attitude was rude. He kept on asking if we would like the valet parking service for 25/day and we told him we don't need it (The fact is that we already park the car on the street in front of the hotel for free because it's the weekend) Anyways, the worse part is that when we went inside the room, we found out that the bed was really dirty. It looked fine on the outside but when we tried to pull down the blanket, there were so much vaccum dirt + one old blood stained spot on the bed linen. Because it was late at night and my children were very sleepy, I did not ask for a change of room at that moment. My husband just swiped off all the dirt (vaccum dirt + fur ball) for both beds (we stayed in the \"art of two beds\") , put the dirty blood stained linen away and then placed our children on bed. Problems arose middle of the night because my 1 year old baby kept on crying due to the uncomfortability of the bed. Then, I discovered that her skin turned red because she was allergic to the dust that we did not completely swiped off. My poor little girl did not sleep for the night and so did I. At 10am, I complained to the front desk and he upgraded us to another bigger room. (His reaction was so normal as if it was just another same complain) Still, the same problem for the other room but the condition seems \"better\", just a little fur ball + few hair.......... Also, when we took our shower at night, we had to do it quick because there was not enough hot water for 4 of us. It costed me almost US280/2 nights.

The bed was amazingly comfortable, reminded me of the \"Heavenly Beds\" you get at the Westin. I highly would recommend this hotel if you want a unique, modern, hip experience in Seattle. Its good value too. The front desk staff was amazingly friendly, and the valet parking is a nice touch ($25/day w/in-out privileges is not bad for downtown). The restaurant beside it is convenient for quick breakfast bites (good) or a drink, but if you are in Seattle on vacation, not sure why anyone would eat at a hotel restaurant period when there are so many great places around (i.e. Pike Market). The location is pretty central to all the shopping and to Pike (about 3-4 blocks). The next time I am Seattle, I would definitely stay here again (and recommend it to friends too).

The original pieces of local art in the lobby and the rooms are refreshing.

More annoyingly there was an air vent attached to the building next door which provided a constant low drone that became disturbing very quickly. I tried to compensate by turning the a/c up but that just increased the amount of rumble as the unit is so old. The manager put me in a larger room across the hall instead. No air vent industrial hum here just excessive traffic noise from Stewart St. There is basically no sound-proofing in this hotel as my investigations into several other rooms proved - you either get the persistent drone of air vents at the back or juggernauts & car horns rattling your windows at the front at all times of the day. One last piece of noise pollution reared it's ugly head later though - the couple next door had clearly found the sex pack (condoms, lubricant, vibrator etc) available to buy in the room & at that point I discovered there was absolutely no sound insulation within the hotel from room to room either.

I didn't even mind the constant rush hour traffic penetrating my windows all the way up on the 9th flloor - and I don't think another floor would have made a difference as there's only 10 stories to the hotel. But in the middle of the night just when one is sound asleep, between about 3 and 4AM, there was LOUD metal clattering the entire HOUR. This happened for 2 nights! I would think it was garbage pick up as road or buidling construction is ususally wrapped up by the time peoople are ready to call it a day. When I called down to reception early in the morning to ask for earplugs, they'd run out. As the hotel was fully booked that night due to it being all that was left downtown thanks to a conference according to someone at dinner, earplugs were the only choice one had. On the same night, a giant moth the size of butterfly - I wish I was making this up - decided to flutter around my room. When I called down to reception, they came up w/in 5 minutes to resolve the problem. However, management was not as responsive when I'd conveyed my adventurous night with 2-3 hours of solid sleep to him. His nonchalant reply was \" that's what you should expect when staying downtown.\" How RUDE!! I told him that I'd stayed at the Pan Pacific which is DOWNTOWN (only 2 blocks over and 2 small blocks up) and the noise level was nowhere near what I'd experienced at Hotel Max. I wish they were classy enough to think to offer a glass of wine each evening to help me sleep. But I guess that was wishful thinking as he was barely apologietic. As I don't find sleeping w/ earplugs comfortable, I decided to wear my self out and not go to sleep until I was beyond exhausted the last night there.

While the Max is on the high end (price wise) of what I typically pay when traveling for pleasure, it's still very competetive with other downtown Seattle hotels (priceline has spoiled me over the years, so anything over $150 per night seems like a splurge). We called ahead to confirm a late check in and to double check that we were all set for our reserved room with 2 beds -- seemed all was A-ok. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very attentive front desk clerk, who even went looking for bottled water for us! After experiencing a smooth check in, we were soon on our way to our 8th floor room. First impressions -- the room was far larger than I had expected! I, of course had only seen the one room, but complaints regarding size seem to be the norm for reviews of this hotel. The wardrobe was plenty spacious (I had taken particular note, as someone mentioned they had to hang their clothes at an angle -- if their room had the same wardrobe -- I have to question how large are your clothes?! ;)). One downfall... the room, while non-smoking and on a non-smoking floor, had clearly been home to guests who have yet to realize that CIGARETTE SMOKE SMELLS and LINGERS. I probably could have adjusted, but my co-worker is particularly sensative, so this was a problem. We attempted to switch rooms, but were informed that the hotel was booked -- we would have to wait until morning. In an effort to rid the room of the reek... we opened the windows, and that helped a bit. The beds were laden in white down comforters/duvets and loads of pillows... and let me tell you -- this bed put the Westin Heavenly bed to SHAME! Kudos x 2 on the comfy beds! The bathroom was reasonably spacious complete with the typical ameneties. Being a \"hip/edgy\" sort of place, the MAX has it's own line of bath products -- each in a simple white bottle with white lettering. There is also mimi fridge, wine glasses, CD player and a few CD singles, flat screen TV, two seersucker robes lined with terry cloth, a selection of teas and coffee and even a \"adult\" novelty item (for purchase, of course!). Another observation worth mentioning, I found the room to be impeccibly clean. I tend to notice creepy \"brown\" corners in hotel rooms and this room was creepy-free. Having just flown in from the East Coast, I was happy to settle in the oh-so-sensational bed for some Z's! BTW: there is a window ac/heating unit that some may call noisy, I personally have never met a heating and air unit in a hotel that wasn't! Also... when you visit a big metropolitan city, be prepared to hear a little traffic outside! (Kills me when people go to NYC or some similiar place and complain about the street noise!) The room gets 'A' grade! The following morning, we were assured that our request for a smoke free room was being handled, so we packed our bags and checked them at the front desk before heading out for the day. The hotel is in a good location, very close to Pacific Place Mall, just a couple of blocks from the monorail to the space needle and a straight shot down Stewart to the Public Market. It's crucial to note that there is a starbucks to your right -- and left, as you exit the hotel. My co-worker and I love to walk, so had no problems getting around to all of the sights. The MAX is also located just a few blocks from the \"free ride\" zone that allows you to travel on the city bus for free to the key downtown areas. Location gets an 'A' (although some may feel it's just a hair out of the way. We did experience a couple of hiccups when trying to switch rooms, but the staff was very patient and dilligent in making sure we were taken care of... they even offered us a bottle of wine! Staff gets an 'A' as well. The adjoining restaurant is a great spot for drinks... we loved the atmosphere, but did not have dinner. Overall-- I give this hotel great praise and would definitely reccommend it. It's on the funky side, so if you're more of a Comfort Inn kind of person, you may feel a little more at home elsewhere.

I loved the design of the separate shower stall and the separate bathroom and the layout of the room was well done to make the room feel bigger than it was. There were bigger rooms on the 2nd floor as my colleague was in one. The plusses for this hotel were definitely the decor, the TV and the comfortable bed. The small gym with two elliptical trainers and two treadmills (all with personal TV) was nice and conveniently on the second floor. HOWEVER - there were two major minuses that really detracted from the experience for me - a very non-picky traveller: 1. It was very cold in Seattle, even for January, and the only heating for the room came from an in window heating/cooling unit. Without the heater on - cold air did come in through the windows making the room quickly cold. With the heater on - the small room was so noisy that I couldn't sleep or hear the television with it on. 2. The walls, at least on the 2nd floor, are extremely thin. I was kept awake at night by people talking/watching television in the next room and my colleague had the same experience being woken up by next door early risers.

The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center. For the price, I don't think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle. The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young (nearly all under 40 years). The rooms are quite small, (although not all the same size for doubles), and the room was clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet. The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink (I thought it was malfunctioning), but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasn't hip enough to figure it out. One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew. Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor. The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests (internet service in rooms requires an extra fee). The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights. The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways (I was sharing a double room with two other people). My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it. It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong. We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty. The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market.

Overall, I would recommend the Max but hopefully you can get it for a lower rate. I booked the reservation through their website. I never received a confirmation email (as mentioned on the site) so the week prior to our arrival date I called to confirm. Their reservation line apparently doesn't handle the online reservations and transferred me to the Front Desk, she transferred me back to the reservation line. The reservation agent told me to call the Front Desk back again, at a later time, using a non-toll free number. I gave up trying to talk to anyone and tried my luck with email. I included a few extra questions about parking, check-in, etc. That same day I received a stock-reservation confirmation email with no answers to my questions. Not ideal but it was something. The hotel is great. The local art is a fun touch. There is a book containing all the Hotel Max art and artists in your room (it's for sale but you can peruse without charge). The location is also very convenient to many shops and sights. It's about a 10 minute walk to the market. The staff is very friendly. They warned us about delays with valet parking. Unfortunately, even with an early call to tell them we needed the car, we still had to wait 15 minutes in the lobby. We stayed in a queen room. It is small but not too crowded. Very intimate. It reminded me of NYC hotel rooms. It's a converted building so it has a different feel than the cookie cutter large hotels. The bed was great. A bit soft for my taste but we slept well. Negatives: The A/C is noisy and the towels are thin and scratchy. (The towels really should be upgraded.) Our total bill came to $257, this included one night of parking, taxes, and 3 local calls. A bit much for our taste but about average for decent, downtown Seattle hotels that weekend. Overall we were satisfied.

Perhaps we were given the worst king room in the hotel since someone mistakenly quoted us an extra-low room rate. The sheets were super-starched but the selection of pillows and the down duvet were very nice. The bathroom towels were cheap and scratchy, and the tub and sink are starting to show wear. The air conditioner has adjustable temperature settings, but the fan is always quite strong, which isn't very nice at night. On our second day our used towels were removed, but they were not replaced. The location is good if you're interested in the market and downtown shopping, but it's definitely not the closest option and you might be able to get closer without paying more.

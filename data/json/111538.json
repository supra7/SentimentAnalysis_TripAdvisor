I did not use any of the fitness or spa facilities other than the walking trails, which were very peaceful and inviting. The room was large, clean, and very quiet (I did not hear any noise at all). The staff was unfailingly polite and helpful. The only negative was that the decor of the room looked like it was straight out of the 1980's (wallpaper, furniture, bath fixtures, etc). The room was also very dark, so I needed to turn on lights even during the day. If the Cooper Lodge updates their rooms, this could really become a fabulous destination.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cMore a clinic than a spa. For weekend pamper stay go elsewhere.\u201d", "Author": "TeresaCLondon", "ReviewID": "UR123455718", "Content": "I booked in by myself for a spa weekend. I didn't book any programme or anything like that. It was a bad start: I found reception and was given my key. I wasn't told anything else: I.e. where is my room, where is the fitness centre, spa, breakfast room, restaurant. Obviously I worked it out. My room was large and nicely furnished. Good wifi service, clean, comfortable. The place looks like a campus though and I was thinking more landscaped grounds which was a surprise. So, no view to speak of from the rom, just joggers going round the track! The gym is a short walk and it's massive and well equipped. There is a small ladies sauna and jacuzzi in the changing room. Decent, but nothing more than you'd find in a decent gym. I booked a massage and the therapist, Lindy, was lovely. I recommend her. The let down for me was the dining. I stopped by the \"restaurant\" for dinner on both nights. It was like someone's living room, moreover empty of people and no tables laid. Very weird. So I got room service which was speedy and good food. Don't expect a wine list though :) it's tee total. Similarly, the breakfast set up was like a cheap motel: tiny glass lean to with a help yourself counter of standard bagels, cornflakes etc. I was expecting fresh cooked healthy fare on a white tablecloth... Overall, it was relaxing but as a spa weekend experience I would opt for one of the fancy hotels next time. It's more of a clinic than pamper place.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAways a perfect and wonderful experince\u201d", "Author": "jon g", "ReviewID": "UR123320256", "Content": "I love staying at the cooper center. the staff is wonderful, it is not only relaxing but the gym is top notch. every detail is taken care of and the entire structure works as a unit.

There were several outdoor pools which appeared to be heated as it was November and they were full of swimmers doing laps.

I had a hallway, bar, living room and bedroom. Extremely spacious! I thought while it was nice, it had some deferred maintenance, such as the rose colored carpet faded in spots and needed to be replaced. The bathroom, while large and nice, needed to be updated because it screamed \"1980\" to me. On the weekday, there was a free continetal breakfast, but the room was in horrible condition, not at all nice. I ate in the almost empty dining room which aslo needed to be updated, because it looked very 1975 to me. The food was just OK. The ground are lovely and a very large campus. The buildings looked like they needed to be repainted about 3 years ago. The excercise facility was nice, but also a little old looking.

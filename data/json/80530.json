Room was plenty big and had nice area to get work done if need be. Bar area was nice and drinks were good. There was an older gentleman who came around offering free cigars which was a nice touch, even if I didn't take one. Close to a couple freeways as well as other dining options.

I come here twice a year for business. Off of the top of my head what I like the most is: Free and safe parking Clean microwave and frig in the room Huge flat screen television - but not enough channels at all. Food Network though. Fantastic memory foam bed - at least I think that's what it's make of. They do have a coffee pot in the room with a good assortment of coffee and teas, they are wonderful enough to include liquid creamer. When I first began staying here the mugs were ceramic and I loved it - now they are paper. They don't have central heat or air conditioning - it is the machine that attaches to the window - but, I've never minded this because I love the hum of those machines, they tend to drown out any background noise. Cleaning crew is really good, front staff have never left me hanging, I even like the coffee lady in the lobby. I've never had an issue with anyone who works there. There are times when I need a late check out and they do their best to accommodate me. I love to take a walk around the hotel every day at the lunch break, there are nice chairs to sit in around the property where you can watch the golfers do their thing. The negative stuff is small: Top complaint is the connecting door between rooms - there is an inch of air space under the door and you can hear every shuffle of your neighbors feet as they scuffle across the room. This gap is also present under the front door which doesn't help in keeping any hallway noise out so I take a towel from the bathroom and block the gap up when it's time to hit the sack. Also, I have not had much luck getting rooms with bathtubs with drains that plug. I need to plug the drain with a washcloth in order to take a bath as opposed to a shower. They have great water temperatures - if you want hot water, they have it. My last complaint is the taste of the water. They provide you with one free bottle of water on the day that you check in, but that is it. The water out of the faucet is very very bad. That's it with the negative side. My room has always had internet. A few years back you needed to go to the front dest for an ethernet cord - but now you just sign on through the hotel's site. It was free. Now, as far as what to do. If you came without a car you will get your daily exercise in :) Head out of the hotel and go right on Aero Drive, when you get to Conroy make a right. This street has tons of food places (this is mainly an Asian area so that plays out in the food choices) as well as drug stores like CVS. Probably a 15 minute light walk each way. If you drove, head out of the hotel to the left and go about two miles, stay in the right lane. When you see the McDonalds turn right (This is the light before the freeway) On that stretch there is a WalMart and Frys Electronics among other places. Take note that they just put in traffic cameras at that big intersection - the camera flashes go off like mad - so follow the rules and save your money :) Twice in past visits I opted to stay at different hotels that were cheaper and closer to places to eat. I was sorry I did it. Now I just book this place as far in advance as I can. This visit was $99 per day mid-week. My summer visits are about $135. Like I stated in the title of this review - if you need to stay in this exact area then this is the best hotel you have to choose from. If you can push it to Mission Valley you can get a nicer room for less and be in the middle of everything - but that all depends on how you want to work it. All the best and I hope this helps!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, MA", "Title": "\u201cNo heated pool or spa, slow Internet, no charm\u201d", "Author": "lt3333", "ReviewID": "UR124870144", "Content": "Despite saying on their website that they had a heated pool and spa -- it wasn't.

I called the shuttle when I touched down at SAN and the driver swung by to pick me up in about 15 minutes. When I got to the hotel, I was rather underwhelmed at the interior. It felt like someone took out all the furniture. I went into my SPG room and while it was very spacious I still got the same empty feeling as the foyer and the outside halls. The whole place feels almost like an aeroplane hangar rather than a hotel, but I'll concede it is a Four Points so you cannot expect too much going in. The bed is fine as in most Four Points/Sheratons. The one thing which really prevented me from giving this hotel a 2 rating were the staff. The check-in/out staff were very friendly and I even noticed they were extremely patient with the lady ahead of me during check-out who was asking some rather stupid questions. Probably the best person at this hotel for me was the shuttle driver in the morning to take me back to SAN. He addressed me by name, recommended some places to visit next time I was in town and just had an overall great attitude.

I was a bit worried when I read all the reviews, but our family was pleasantly surprised the moment we walked in. The open feeling was so nice - I actually loved the railings and NO it didn't feel like a prison - it was very nice and spacious everywhere - much better than small long hallways of a typical hotel. When we checked in, the girl at the desk was pleasant and recommended a room away from the dining area to avoid the noise at night, which we appreciated. She did have a rather large tongue ring that we couldn't help noticing, but she was very friendly and helpful. When we entered the room it was large and spacious with 2 queens, a large desk and chair and a very big flat screen TV. The room was clean and decor very nice. The beds were very comfy - one of the best I've slept in! There was a fridge, microwave and we apprciated the camomile tea and complimentary water bottle. The bathroom was clean and spacious - tub shower was nice. Location was GREAT!! There were several oriental/Thai restraunts just down the road that were exceptional (Korea BBQ was amazing). Our boys loved the grounds - lots of lawn and trees. They had fun kicking the soccer ball and throwing the frisbee Pool was large and heated and the hottub was huge, though not as hot as other hottubs we've been in. Gym was open late - we went around 10:30 and all the basics were there for a nice workout We ran into a security guy on the way to the gym and he was very helpful and we felt very safe. Hotel was easy to find and in an excellent location. Check out wasn't until noon which gave us extra time to do a little laundry and pack at our convenience instead of being rushed We would definately return again and highly recommend this hotel.

We had a light bulb burned out, and I showed it to the housekeeper, but it still was not changed, until a day later when I called the front desk.

I would say the only reason its rated as a 3 star establishment is because of the restaurants and the convention area, along with the golf course, which are all fine and dandy, but they lack in attention to detail in their rooms. I would much rather spend the little more money and stay at the Courtyard or Doubletree, and get a much better experience, even if I would have to pay for parking over there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worth it for the comfort. On another bright note the staff was friendly and always wanting to help, which means that if no other hotels were available I would be coming back to this one, because in the end, its not the worst.

Overall: They are still doing some remodeling but they are about 90% done. Outside Decor: Clean with lots of trees. Fountain located at front entrance with check-in desk located to the right off the entrance and cafe and restaurant located on the left. Since it's located within a golf range, it's not bad. Parking: The only Sheraton in San Diego with FREE PARKING!! The hotel and parking lot is about a 1/2 block in from the main street. The parking lot is a bit dark at night so it's best to have a timed-delay for your headlights. When you arrive or parking for the night, park in the right lot that loops around the building as this lot is closer to the rooms. The parking lot of the left lot is closer to the restaurant and cafe (not best to park here on Sundays). Parking lot could be repaved and lines drawn because you'll notice that people will park all randomly in the first lot you arrive in. Interior: Very nice lobby until you get to the room \"hallways\" (see pictures). Like what others have said, the area where the rooms are located is very prison like. The way the building is formed, there are 3 hallways that all look alike and there is no signage tell you which rooms are in which area. There are sofas located in the middle and ends of each hallway. The elevator badly needs maintenance. Don't be surprise if it waddles and shakes a little. Other than that, it's pretty bare. Rooms: Very clean, except for the tub tiles. There is microwave, fridge, 20\" TV and desk. Plenty of channels to watch including HBO and HBO family. There's Cartoon Network and Nick, but sorry no Disney. Beds are clean and comfortable. The AC/Heat unit is standard and loud like others, too bad they didn't install quite units. Minor differences b/w the pictures you see here and what's in the room. The pictures in this website was for a room located in the 1st floor and I stayed on the 3rd floor. There are no views for any of the rooms due to the trees and layout of place. Area: Even though it's away from downtown and other tourist hot spots, you're very close to everything. You're no more than 10 min. drive to SeaWorld, Downtown, Airport, Old Town, and beaches. If you're only staying for the weekend, don't bother renting a car. They have shuttles that will pick you up and take you around....BUT you must call ahead of time and confirm. This hotel is next to another smaller airport for private planes and helicopters, but you'll never hear anything. It's also very close to 805 & 163, but you'll never hear anything either. Food: Your blocks within a Korean district with lots of restaurants and grocery shopping. When exiting the hotel parking lot, turn right, go two blocks to Convoy St, turn right and starting from there and for the next mile there will be lots of places to eat. There are also lots of other places to eat on Balboa Ave and Clairemont Mesa Blvd (these are cross streets).

Sometime during my first night there was a blockage in one of the rooms being renovated either below me or above me and an air bubble caused my bathroom sink to overflow into the bathroom (according to maintenance), covering the entire bathroom floor and all MY TOILETRIES with brown gunky water. This was not cool, however maintenance did show up fast and cleaned it up, then supposedly snaked the drain while I was out that day. However the next morning the exact same thing happened, needless to say I was livid. Renovation is one thing unlivable rooms is another. Management did quickly move me though. As you can see in one of the photos another guest posted there is construction material in the halls, that is no joke, it really is there and the hotel smells like a construction site.

We had a western regional Yamaha STAR motorcycle (that's a type of cruiser motorcycle, BTW, like Toyota Camry or Honda Accord-you know, a model of a make) 'convention' type thingy going on from Friday until Sunday. The hotel allowed us to take up a goodly amount of their spacious parking lot for m/c vendors, demo rides w/Yamaha, skills contests, etc. We had the whole lounge area on Friday night for a \"Meet & Greet\" and karaoke. The drink prices in the lounge weren't too bad ($4 for a Coors Light, not bad for inside a hotel) and the grounds were pretty darn nice with a VERY clean pool and jacuzzi, and two 'pitch & putt\" par 3 holes. They also have a coffee cart and a little gift shop with the usual analgesics, toiletry items, yada, yada, yada. The renovation project wasn't too bad, although I heard from some folks who had been staying the week that the jackhammers were a bit much, but we didn't hear anything. Frankly, for a hotel to 'put up with' a bunch of bikers (well, actually people with a median age of 40-45 riding cruisers and who pride themselves on SAFETY FIRST) is a pretty darn cool hotel, in my opinion, because around 300+ motorcycles parked in a parking lot usually kinda makes people a leetle bit apprehensive. FYI INFO- Room service menu kinda pricey, but aren't they all? Room was nice, lots of storage, shampoo and conditioner and bath bars and facial bars and hairdryer. Refridge and microwave and coffee maker with Seattle's Best Coffee and Tazo tea (we didn't find the microwave until we opened up a cupboard looking for extra things to pack when leaving, and it surprised us) 'Citrus' restaurant had a nice selection of breakfasts, plus a nice breakfast buffet for $14-15. On weekdays, I guess they have an omelette bar, but not on weekends. Saw a flyer for a Champagne Sunday brunch, but we had to leave & try to beat the rain-we're on motorcycles, remember? We were given free bottles of water in our room every day-that was a definitely nice touch. Refridgerator was available, and DIDN'T have any of the usual overpriced drinks already inside. That was pretty cool! Lounge had a popcorn machine & free popcorn for a snack-nice touch. They have a fitness center-didn't try it. The pool temp was pleasantly at around 70 and the jacuzzi around 100.

You have to understand, you are staying at 4 points, not at westin or st.regis (and look at the rate that you are paying at this property)! so you have to judge them with a different scale (its like comparing a fast food vs a dine in restaurant, give me a break!)

Super convinent! and parking in this area are lot easier than downtown hotels and best of all, FREE parking! Landscape - pretty nice! they got golf courses where many family came over the weekend with their kids playing golf, very quiet most of the time at the hotel too. Very safe to park as well.

Nice and quiet as a result though. The hotel itself was clean but not exactly cosy. It was pretty clinical and resembled some sort of prison the way it was laid out with different wings! It was quite business-conferency! We didn't eat in the hotel but had dinner at a near by all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet, which was fantastic! The concierge had actually recommended another Chinese to us so that would imply that there are a few places to eat in the vicinity. There is a small shop and coffee bar in the hotel.

Bellman was busy watching TV in the lobby instead of helping me drag in my luggage. Two front desk clerks were busy in a personal conversation and didn't stop when I walked up to the desk, I had to wait about 30-seconds until they were done. Room was terrible, old carpet, wallpaper, musty smell. I went back to the desk to change rooms and was told \"oh, all our rooms are like that, we're going to renovate soon but haven't started yet\". So I guess I lucked out and had to pay full rate for something I'd expect from a Motel 6. Restaurant was good, which was the only saving grace to this place. At the pool, I saw an employee leave via the locking gates and keeping it ajar so he could come back, and when he did, he left the gate still ajar I guess for the next employee who's too lazy to use a key. I'm glad I don't have a toddler who might wander into the pool area and fall in the pool. I mentioned it to the front desk and was told \"I'll let my manager know\" but got that feeling that she wasn't going to say a thing, as she didn't write anything down and just went back to what she was doing when we were done talking. You know that feeling? Someone saying something to you just to satisfy you but they really don't mean it? That's the overall feeling I got from this place.

We wanted to book an affordable last-minute getaway from Los Angeles during the peak expensive Summer season. This hotel worked out great and is in a central location for the price - close to Old Town & SeaWorld, not too far south from La Joya, yet convienent to most highways if you want to go downtown or to Mexico, all of which we were in town for during a weekend. The hotel is not the destination, but it is a nice place to sleep. Our bed was new, and exceptionally comfortable. Our room and carpet was extremely clean and everything was in working order, especially nice since it is time for the property to be remodeled. It does not show its age as much as you would think, however you will see some slight wear on the wooden furniture, tub and slight rust here and there in small places on the bathroom ceiling. The baths definately need a remodel, the tubs are small, but are working and clean to Sheraton standards and for business travel. The outdoor pool is small, but very clean and well-maintained, open 6am to 11pm, next to the fitness center. Having a tiny Starbucks stand in the lobby is a nice treat, but it opens at 6am and closes before dinner time. We did not use the golf course. Overall the good experience with the staff and rates here out-weigh the major bad issues, which are the same as mentioned in the other reviews; you definately do need a rental car if you choose to stay here, and also what some have previously called \"antiseptic\" decor. Actually, that is not the best way to describe the layout - it is very much like a three-story airport terminal, very wide institutional style open corredors with no decorations or color. You will understand if you go. But that in itself is no reason to pass on this property, unless you are looking to pay top dollar for the elegant upscale decor of the properties around Mission Beach or La Joya. The rooms do offer some style and color lacking from the huge hallways, a more than comfortable place to sleep. There is a quiet small bar, and an okay restaurant, average hotel food on the pricey side - $15-20 per adult for dinner, but that is the price of convienence. There is plenty to see and do in town without needing to eat in the hotel. Fish tacos are a Southern California treat to look for if visiting from out of state, and there are plenty of good taco places downtown by the waterfront. Or Mexican food if visiting Old Town, which we highly recommend that you try to do here. Check out La Joya if you would like beautiful upscale Pacific vistas and designer restaurants or shopping - think Cartier and Armani meets small town California coastal villiage.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, WI", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Four Points!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4982730", "Content": "For the price, I thought this hotel was great.

Arriving late on our first evening, we were initially a bit concerned about noise / people wandering around as the hotel is situated very close to Old Town, but parking the car and walking into the lobby we were very pleasantly surprised at how 'up market' & well maintained it felt. We had been expecting something a lot more basic and motel-like (penny for penny you would not get anything of this quality at this price in the UK.) Check in was quick, friendly and efficient, and we were given plenty of information regarding what time breakfast was served, pool opening hours and so on. The lobby area was clean & bright, and the elevators were clean and fast. We had gotten a good deal on a queen suite and were extremely pleased with our room which was several floors up and facing the pool. With the pool being available 24/7 we did worry if there would be a lot of noise, but during the 5 days of our stay we heard very little even though it was often busy when we got back from the parks. The room itself comprised 2 comfortable queen beds with blankets (just a minor quibble from me as I prefer comforters / duvets) and plenty of pillows, plus a pull out sofa. The 'kitchen' area comprised a table and chairs and small sink area with cupboards, plus a small fridge and microwave. All were very clean and the room smelled fresh. Bathroom was also very clean and the shower excellent. Very much enjoyed our stay here and intend to return in December. We had a hire car so did not use the shuttle service, if you have a car it's only 25 or so mins drive from Orlando International and a vert straightforward route. You are only a minute's drive from the 192 with its many restaurants and stores and there are Publix, Wal-Mart & Winn-Dixie all within easy reach, plus a Wal-Greens pharmacy more or less just across from Logans over the 192. You are also close to Celebration which is worth a look around. Walt Disney World is very close and is very easy to get to from the hotel, on a good traffic day you can be parking up at magic Kingdom / Epcot / DHS in 10 - 15 mins, maybe less. Old Town is only a few mins walk away and good for a n hour or so's diversion in the evening. We only tried the breakfast a couple of times but have no complaints, there was plenty of it - egg patties, canadian bacon (think 'ham'), waffles, baked beans etc etc plus pastries, fresh fruit, cereal, juice and tea or coffee. Possibly it would get a bit repetitive if you had it every day but hey, its included in the price of your room so its up to you if you want to eat. It made a good slow start to non park days for us and the staff were busy but friendly. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, we were there mid Feb so possibly not the busiest time (UK half term) and have no complaints, it exceeded our expectations and we look forward to staying again.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amherst NS", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased, will return\u201d", "Author": "wallisan", "ReviewID": "UR128357140", "Content": "7 day stay in mid-April 2012.

Cleaning staff very nice and thorough, well worth the $10 tip as were treated very well. Yes the elevators are a bit crowded first thing in the morning but that's par for the course and only a few minutes wait.

The hotel is located right off of US 192 behind Old Town. It is not too easy to find and as your driving in you'll start to fear you made a big mistake by the surrounding area but rest assured the hotel is ahead. It is less than a 10 minute drive from Disney and the hotel provides a free shuttle service. The hotel itself is very clean inside, it has a nice game room, a heated pool, and a poolside bar. Another nice touch was the ability to purchase Disney tickets right in the lobby. The breakfast was also very nice each morning with a wide variety of food along with Mickey shaped waffles. Unfortunately for us, our room, although non-smoking, must have been a recent conversion because the smell of the room was horrible. We attempted to air it out but by the time we realized the smell was not going to go away, we felt it would be too much hassle to move since we were only staying two days. So to be fair, the hotel was not given a chance to rectify the situation. However I do not appreciate this even having to be addressed, it is a huge pet peeve of mine when hotels do not properly clean rooms upon converting them from smoking to non-smoking. The other major issue was the hotel only has two elevators for a very large establishment. They were constantly packed. Also as far as I could find, there was only one staircase that lead to the lobby forcing even more people onto the elevators. While overall the hotel was ok, with the wide selection available in the Orlando/Kissimmee area, I am not sure I would return here again.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and great location!\u201d", "Author": "Meoco17", "ReviewID": "UR127272618", "Content": "This hotel was very nice!

I spent a lot of time reading all the reviews, (the good and the bad) and I hope to address them all. Upon arriving at the hotel, the lobby was well kept and clean, check in went smoothly, room was clean, everything exactly the way I had hoped. The breakfast was a buffet style, and it varied slightly everyday, offering your basic, eggs, sausage, breads, cereal, and my daughter's favourite Mickey Mouse waffles! The coffee was good, and an added bonus, was that it was offered all day long. On previous reviews I noticed people complained about the elevators being slow, yes they were not your fastest moving elevators, but nothing that would deter me from choosing this hotel. The pool area, was well kept, and my kids loved how it was heated. Not sure if they mention on the website or not, but the kiddie pool is closed, and they are doing some sort of work on it. The hot tub looked OK, although I did not use it. My one complaint was the large groups of students that this hotel caters to. At night time they would come back from their various outings, and they would bombard the pool area from about 9pm until 11pm...and if you happen to be in the lobby when they arrived then it was almost impossible to get on the elevator...but I must say, at no time, did any of the students or kids misbehave...there just seemed to be a lot and after a long day at the park, I would have loved to sit by the pool/ bar let the kids have a swim, and wind down, but every-night that we were there...it just became to crowded..so we would just go upstairs to our room. With that being said, I had no trouble whatsoever, we were close to shopping, dining, you are able to get tickets for various attractions right at the hotel, and they even offer shuttle buses, although we opted to drive ourselves, so I can't comment on the shuttle service.

The staff has not been friendly or helpful at all. When we checked in yesterday, I asked whether they offered wheelchair assistance to their guests, just to get around from room to pool to snack bar, etc... I was told that they had one, but that someone was using it. I had just broken my foot, so it was a recent, and immediate concern. They said that I could use it in the morning, and was also told that I could get the phone number for a local service that rents them. So this morning, while my family is at the parks, I thought I'd sit by the pool. I get ready, and call downstairs to ask for the wheelchair. THe person says that they don't have one. I explained the conversation yesterday, and they say they'll call me back. When they do, they say that they can't find it. I hobble downstairs on crutches, and ask at the desk, explaining what I was told last night. The man there, Trey, denies ever telling me that there was one available to use. Right in front of me, told two coworkers that what I was saying wasn't true. I asked about the pool food bar, as I was hungry. They said that it opened at 3, but that they'd probably only do hotdogs today, as there was a big group coming in. What? I asked for a manager, and he/she conveniently wasn't available until tomorrow, after I check out. I asked about the name of someone on their \"Manager on Duty\" board, and they said that was only the engineer. What?

We noticed that the hotel would be amazing if you was disabled the floor ground is for disabled people and the tables at breakfast has enough room for a wheelchair also the transport buses to the theme parks have all of the equipment to carry a wheelchair.

The hotel is facing old town which is great if youve got kids, however you have to buy a wristband you cannot just pay for one ride if you only like the look of one. The transport can be a bit of a nightmare as it picks up a few hotels before comfort suites so if there are alot of people already on it it may be hard to try to find a seat, the driver then goes on to pick up other hotels even when there is no room at all!!, and the times of the buses can be a bit of a pain as you either get there too early or you get there half way through the day, also the coming back is a nightmare too as everyone is waiting for this bus, however dont let this put you off the hotel because all of the hotels use this bus so it doesnt matter where you stay. But if you want to go to the parks on your own time outside of the pondarrosa theres a busstop the bus is either 56/57 i cant remember but it says magic kingdom on it its only $2 but if you want to get another bus its still $2 just tell the drive you want a hopper before you pay. outside of the ferris wheel theres a busstop where you can get picked up for busch gardens it is free aslong as you have your ticket for busch gardens otherwise you have to pay, it is worse getting this bus as it costs $300 each way in a taxi. The location of the hotel is amazing its about 30mins aways from magic kingdom including all of the hotels stops and about 40mins for universal, it also offers a shopping bus that takes you to lake buena vista shopping mall for free, but if you are interested in shopping i suggest going to orlando premium outlets there so amazing and very cheap too, the reception try there best to help you with all of your problems, however the woman on the ticket desk is very rude and does not help at all, the hotel is in the middle of everyone resturant possible such as ponderrosa, sizzling grill(highly reccommend), kfc, mcdonalds, burger king, red lobster, pizza hunt etc etc etc, so you will never ever go hungry!, we really enjoyed this hotel and the location is very ideal. Oh yes and by the way all of the reviews saying dont stay here because you can hear old town NO YOU CANT, we was facing old town and you cant hear NOTHING old town closes around 11oclock aswell.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florence", "Title": "\u201cperfect for families\u201d", "Author": "hoteldali", "ReviewID": "UR125087148", "Content": "Just perfect for families, nice, clean, free parking, nice pool, close to the parks and very reasonable prices compared with the other hotels.

The breakfast staff is hardworking and constantly refilling items, so no problem there. They are very attentive, for sure. The pool area is very nice, the water is heated and there is a small separate kiddie pool. The area is very clean and well kept, and there is a nice supply of towels waiting for your there. In the late evening there is a small bar that opens in that area. We did not venture to it, but some folks did and they seemed to be having a good time(not rowdy though...) The lobby is large, nothing too fancy but again, clean - as is the whole hotel. Parking is right out front and convenient. There is every possible chain restaurant (both sit down and fast food) on the main strip within 4 or 5 minutes from the hotel. Another neat feature is its location to a small amustment park known as \"Old Town\" Kissimmee. There are some rides for the kids, if you are not looking for a full days entertainment. And there are some cute shops and a few restauarants. This is all within a 3 minute walk out the front door of the hotel. We felt very safe in the area in general. I would say the area between this hotel and over to Disney is nice. If you go the opposite direction about 5miles, well,,,,,,,, not as nice(but we drove 10miles that direction every day, did not feel I was in any danger - just not a well kept area). For our purposes the placed worked about really, really well. We only went to Walt Disney Magic Kingdom (1day) as we were in town for another purpose. Stayed at this hotel 6nights with no problem. The room we had was quite large. 2 queen beds plus a pull out sofa. Also large fridge and microwave, plus a sink outside of the bathroom (bathroom has its own).

I was traveling with a small child and had a lot of bags and there was no help offered -- never even told me about the luggage carts that would've helped me. But I am not sure that it can be blamed on this hotel or just the area in general. Tourists are a dime a dozen so they are not so quick to bend over backwards for you. Beware that their theme park shuttles only run a few times a day and if you want to go at any other time, they will happily call you a (overpriced) cab. They don't tell you that if you walk the few blocks up to Highway 192, you can catch the Lynx city bus #56 for $2 that will take you to the exact same place as the shuttle -- and it runs every 20 minutes. You do have to cross the street and walk down a bit, but it still beats the cab, and it will drop you off on the way back right in front of Old Town. And if you need a cab for any other reason, I would suggest calling your own and not going with who the hotel recommends. I think they really take advantage of tourists who don't know any better. And they don't have a shuttle from the airport or the train station. Again, use your own cab service. The hotel's location was pretty good...Old Town is a neat little spot -- had a really good quick bite at the Tex-Mex place. And there's a whole amusement park right there in front of the hotel with very reasonable prices and a nice mini-golf place, too.

I did read that someone didn't like the breakfast (it was free) If they couldn't fine something to eat that they liked then they should of stayed in their room, they had anything and everything to eat an it was good.=) We would and will be back to stay here again.

We often stay at Comfort Suites because we can get two beds plus the pull-out sofa, so we already knew what to expect from this hotel chain. This particular hotel is in very good repair, especially considering that it is in a high-traffic area and caters to vacationing families and youth groups. It is freshly painted and the furnishings look relatively new. As others have mentioned, the elevators are slow - so if you are impatient and averse to using the stairs, I suggest you ask for a lower-floor room. We had a room on the 4th floor that faced out the front - it had a nice view of Old Town in the evening. I was initially worried that late-night noise from the nearby rides and outdoor entertainment might be an issue, but it was not. The complimentary breakfast buffet had a variety of hot and cold items and was quite good. The staff at this hotel was excellent - very courteous and helpful. Everyone from the front desk receptionist, breakfast servers, housekeeping and the man touching up paint in the hallway greeted us with a good morning and a smile. Kudos to the management of this hotel for quality maintenance of the property and staff training! It's the attention to detail and the staff that makes this a 5-star hotel in its category. This hotel is easy to get to from the highway and has convenient access to Disney. Next to the hotel is an area called Old Town. There are carnival rides, go karts, midway games, mini golf, cheesy tourist shops and restaurants. We happened to be there on a Saturday night so there was also a classic car show and outdoor entertainment. This is not an upscale operation and I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip for it, but since it was right next to the hotel, we did wander over there for an hour or so.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "AmyP1989", "ReviewID": "UR117628766", "Content": "Loved every moment only downside pool bar don't open till 3 n kiddie pool not big enough Otherwise FAB", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMy best Florida trip yet!\u201d", "Author": "Debw555", "ReviewID": "UR117366779", "Content": "This was my 3rd trip to Florida as a single mum and my favourite hotel yet.

The bathroom was large, well lit and well stocked with toiletries and the shower stayed hot even at 'peak shower time'. It was nice to have a kitchenette in the room, so we didn't need to find somewhere to eat out for every meal, but there was no crockery or cutlery supplied in the rooms so that had to be bought elsewhere or borrowed from the breakfast area. The free breakfast was definitely an added bonus to our stay and there was enough to enable us to vary what we ate so we didn't get too bored eating the same thing every morning. Free tea, coffee and hot water in the breakfast area throughout the day was a nice touch too. The 2 elevators where a little slow at busy times, we stayed at an off peak time so it was only really during the breakfast period that we were affected, so we used the stairs to help work off that sausage and egg. None of us used the fitness room, though it did look quite well equipped we felt walking round the parks and swimming was enough exercise for us, which brings us to the pool, plenty of seating/loungers and towels were available, the pool was a good temperature and the hot tub was boiling! 2 minutes was enough for me! Loved the location too, right behind the old town and close to restaurants so we were able to nip out a fair few evenings without the car. Our only gripe about the hotel was the wall thickness, any raised voices in the adjoining rooms was almost like being in there with them, we had one couple argue all night which wasn't pleasant, when we enquired about moving rooms at the reception we found out that luckily the couple were moving on that day.....only to replaced at the weekend by a couple of coach loads of teenage girls on our floor. So if you stay at peak times when a room change is not possible you might want to pack some earplugs to get you through noisy nights.

Very friendly people at the stores, and the entertainment on the stage was out of this world. Front desk staff was so good to help us get back to the Orlando Airport. We never had any issues with the hotel. Everyone said hello in the hallways. We felt right at home. We stayed for a week and the breakfast was very good. Hotel is extremely clean, and the rooms were done up well. Beds were very comfortable, and linens well pressed and beds made up perfectly. The drapes were great, and nicely decorated, which kept the room dark in the morning. The bathroom was well equipment with shampoos, soaps, conditioners. Did not spare anything. The furniture is good quality. We really felt like we were on vacation staying at Comfort Suites. The internet worked good, and lots of room on the desk to work from. Had many coupon books in the lobby for local restaurants, which was very helpful. Don't rent townhouses nearby, as they are dirty and stinky, and not as safe an area like this hotel. We enjoyed walking to Old Town, and some of the best restaurants in town. The suite has plenty of room for a family. The kitchenette had a kettle and coffee maker, along with a little fridge/freezer and microwave. Kitchen cabinets and a sink. What more would someone want? Rooms were made up on a timely manner, and the carpets were cleaned daily. Our suite was kept up in a timely manner. We enjoyed walking through the door, to have the suite totally taken care of. Now I call this a real vacation. We bought a few things at the grocery store, and had snacks at night. Ground maintenance was great. Always cleaning and it sure showed it, when you drive up to the front doors. There was a shuttle bus also that takes you to the hotel. Car rentals just around the corner. The shopping nearby was also good. Be careful going out at night away from the hotel. Some areas are questionable. If you stay on the main road 192, then everything should be okay. We will be taking a cruise from Port Canaveral, and will stay a few nights, just to visit Old Town and take in the entertainment.

Epcot - 11.40 or 12.20 returning at 21.45 Universal and Seaworld - 9.50 returning at 19.45 Must remember that there are internal Disney shuttles that run to all Disney water parks and theme parks.

Comfort Suites has nailed down everything you need for a relaxing vacation, or even just a weekend get-a-way. You're hotel stay includes a hot breakfast buffet, for FREE! It's not one of those comtinental breakfasts either. There is scrambled eggs, french toast, bagels, toast, sausage gravy & biscuits, cereal, a variety of juices, as well as a Mickey waffle station. And there is coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day. For a family of four this will save you about $40-$50 per day by eating at the hotel as opposed to going to one of the outside breakfast buffets. The pool and jacuzzi are open 24 hours, and they provide towels at the pool so you aren't wasting your room towels, and then chasing housekeeping for more towels. The tiki bar at the pool is very reasonably priced. A mixed drink costs about $5, which is nothing compared to the $10 the Disney hotels charge for the same size drink! Some of the rooms are a little dated, but otherwise very clean and comfortable. None of those flat, lifeless pillows, in fact you get 4 to a bed! The comforter is very comfy, and the sheets are soft. The bathroom is oversized, which is great when you're staying for a week, there is plenty of room to spread out all of your toiletries! The room also comes equipped with a decent sized refrigerator (bigger than those tiny dorm-sized ones), cupboards to store your paper plates, a microwave, a coffee pot with coffee supplies, and a small kitchen sink. All of these items at a Disney value resort are extra. In fact, the fridge at Disney in a value resort runs a little over $10 a day, and it's the tiny dorm fridge. In order to get a fridge for free at Disney you need to book a moderate resort or higher, which can be costly. The hotel is located within walking distance of Old Town and FunSpot. They are certainly no Disney World, but a nice change and pace if you have an extra day to spare. I can't remember if internet is complimentary in the rooms, but I was able to access their server by the pool. I never tried to access it in the room itself. The only negative I can find at this hotel is the elevators are EXTREMELY slow. Ask for a 1st or 2nd floor room. All in all I give Comfort Suites 5 stars.

On arrival, after an 8\u00bd hour flight, 90 minutes waiting to get through immigration and a 20 minute transfer, we were not made to feel welcome at all. We were handed our keys and told which floor we were on. The check-in lady did not seem very helpful at all and on asking about the shuttle service were just handed a piece of paper. The lady came across as very impolite. The room was basic but adequate however it was not quite as the brochure. The cupboard draws were broken. Both the sink and toilet was blocked on arrival but the maintenance man did call promptly only to have to be called out again the following monring. A word of warning the aircon is very noisy and if you leave it on it was make a raquet throughout the night! Breakfast was included and was OK albeit it was the same most days. Eggs, Muffins, Ham, Beans, Cereal, Toast, Jams and Waffles. Biggest problem was the shuttle service to the theme parks. Too Disney World it was at 8.15 with a pick up at 7.30pm. If you wanted to go to Sea World and Universal Studios it was not until 9.50am with a pick up at 7.30. Epcot was not until 10.50am. The staff at the hotel were not very helpful when we inquired about public transport. They simply had no idea. Luckily we found out that the 56 bus (which goes from outside Pandorosa) takes you straight to Magic Kingdom, a 20 minute journey for 2 dollars. Busses run from 6.00am until 10.40pm Ideal! when you arrive at Magic Kingdom there is a Nr 50 bus which then takes you to Downtown Disney and Sea World. If you ask for a transfer before you get on the Nr 56 bus you do not have to pay for the Nr 50! if you use the transfer within 1 hour. Again the bussess run every half hour and gives you the flexibility to enjoy the theme parks better. The public transport was amazing and very reliable. If you do stay at this hotel I suggest eating at Denny's. The food was fantastic and the service excellent.

We chose this hotel as we had been quite a few years ago and wanted something in Kissimmee, rather than a villa. The Comfort Suites was chosen as we wanted a hotel like you find in the UK rather than a motel, some motels the rooms open straight out onto the grounds rather than into the building. It also needed to have family rooms, sitting and kitchen area, pool and restaurant, it also include a buffet breakfast (bonus). This fitted the bill and checking Trip Advisor had good reports and a good rating, its fair to say I can see where some of the comments come from except the ones about the staff. This is on the basis they could not have been more helpful at check-in or through our time there. Is it recommended yes definitely, will we stay again planning on going in 2013 (hopefully). Its location is ideal, literally next turning right after the big wheel in old town going East on 192. Comfort Suites is the large building next to the Pirates Cove pitch and Putt on the left hand side. There are a number of restaurants locally along with a small supermarket all of which can be walked to, if crossing the road use the traffic lights as there is a crossing there. We didn\u2019t and crossing the 192 (3 lanes ether way) was fun !!, then found out about the crossings. Another tip for driving and wanting to go west on 192 use the service road rather then a \u201cU\u201d turn, its quicker and easier. When you get in the room there are a number of take away leaflets and they get pushed under the door, ideal if you can\u2019t be bothered. Call them up and they deliver, didn\u2019t use it ourselves but all the Americans did. As there is a fridge in the room you may want dinks etc, there are a couple of local supermarkets but we went to Walmart. These are easy to find, 1 is on 192 just keep going it\u2019s a fair way, the other is go East on 192 when you come out of the hotel and turn left at the 3rd set of lights and its straight down that road. You can ask at the desk and they give spot on directions, better than the sat nav. Its wider location is also spot on around 45 mins to an hour from Sanford (using the tollroad, you need $5 - $7 in change as not all booths are manned), and 30 - 45 mins from Orlando airport. Interstate 4 is 5-10 minutes away, the furthest large attraction is Universal about 30 mins away. Also if you don\u2019t fancy driving or don\u2019t have a car walk round old town at night is good fun, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights the are car and bike shows. Hotel facilities are really good, some basic but adequate. The car park is large and you park where you want, make sure you have the pass on especially on Thursday\u2019s, Friday,s and Saturday\u2019s as there are cars parked everywhere due to the shows. In the reception area there is a small shop with some English papers, drinks, chocolate, emergency item, sun cream (get it at Walmart far cheaper than taking with you) and gifts. A small games room which works from tokens, exchange them in the machine in there. Internet access is also available from a machine in the business centre along with a printer, an ATM is also in here though we didn\u2019t use it. Finally a desk to buy park / attraction tickets, no cheaper than gate price but it gets you straight in. The only down side is there try to sell you other items. Also off here is the fitness suite, not massive but if you\u2019re like us you\u2019re on holiday so what the gyms off the agenda. The dining area is also off the reception area with tea / coffee available 24/7. Breakfast is good, cereals, muffins, juices, toast, hot foods (egg, sausage, beans), try the waffles freshly made and some days Mickey shaped. Outside is the pool, kiddie pool and hot tub along with the bar open 15:00 to 23:00 and you will need your ID (in fact you will need it everywhere). Our rooms were excellent on the 4th floor and all had 2 queen size beds and a pull out, so the room could sleep 6. They have air conditioning, this varied room to room on how good it was. Two of the rooms were automatic (set the temp and its trips in and out maintaining that temp), the other room was manual and ran full time (just turn it off when too cold). Also in the room is a safe, you are given the lock when you check in (its covered by the resort charge about $20 for 2 weeks). In the kitchen area there is a fridge, microwave and small sink but no utensils. We had jacket spuds one night and the hotel gave us plates and cutlery, just the job. Also coffee maker, TV with good channels including ESPN, Iron plus board, hair dryer and enough storage for clothes etc (would be tight for 6). Maid service every day, toiletries in the bathroom along with plenty of towels (towels are also at the pool). Impressed with the rooms for size and facilities. Check-in was easy, initially thought we had a misunderstanding with the rooms. Wanted 2 doubles and a family room, I thought she said 3 doubles. Explained what we had booked, she went away to discuss it with some one and came back with a solution. We then had a discussion over what was in the room, then I realised I had made a mistake. The rooms were exactly as we had requested, in fact better than as we were all adjacent to each other. We decided whilst in the US to go to Planet Hollywood, eTickets were cheaper from the UK so ordered them online. Got them as a PDF and the computer in the business centre blocked them. Spoke to the lady on reception who spoke with some one in admin, I then went into their offices to log in and print them off. Also asked them for directions and advice on various things, it was never a problem. They could not have been more helpful. We were all impressed with the hotel, including the wildlife (Racoon, couple of snakes and a spider all taken care of no danger to you).", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC HOTEL WE LOVED IT!\u201d", "Author": "sarahlouise1988", "ReviewID": "UR108105085", "Content": "This hotel is wonderful!

The pool area was fantastic - it backs on to a nature area, so there is nothing behind the resort but greenery. The pool was warm with tons of lounge chairs.

We were impressed with it, and thought we'd try it again. It's still a nice hotel and a good value, but is, how do I say this, feeling tired. As with our prior visit, the 2 elevators are very slow. I recommend you find the stairs. The breakfast is still very good, with a good variety, but the breakfast area gets very busy and finding a table can be difficult at peak times. Breakfast doesn't open until 7:00am, so if you're planning an early visit to Disney which often opens at 8:00, you'll miss the Disney opening activities (as we did waiting for breakfast to open). It would be nice if they opened breakfast earlier. In other hotels we've stayed at they usually will open early, but here, 7:00 on the dot. Our room was ok, not as spiffy as we remembered it last time. It was clean, but there were marks on the walls, the freezer door in the mini fridge was hanging on by only 1 screw, the coffee pot button fell off when we pushed it, and the channel buttons on the TV no longer worked (we misplaced the remote for a while). It's apparent by the fresh paint in the public areas that they do have an upkeep plan, but it's time to refresh the rooms a tad too. The icing on the cake was this. We were staying for 3 nights. On the third night about 10:00, we hear someone trying to open our door. I check the peephole and sure enough, 2 travelers. I open the door to their surprise, and they do in fact have the same room as me, and their key worked, but they couldn't get in because I had the deadbolt on and the \"swing arm lock\" over. They went back to the front desk, and a few minutes later I get a call from the front desk. Who am I and why am I in this room? I give them my name, and they apparently checked me out after the first night of my 3 night stay. I don't think so! No apology, nothing, all they said was that they'd check us back in, gee thanks.

The hotel is ideally located by the Old Town area of Kissimmee with easy access to all the Disney attractions and is just off the I4 allowing a speedy trip to Sea World or Universal. We were more than happy with the Kings suite which we thought was a larger than average room in Kissimmee. The manager was supervising the up grade of rooms one day and was happy to show us round other rooms in the hotel, The Twin bedded rooms are even bigger than the King but the multi roomed suites give an amazing amount of space. I will check out the price of them next time I stay! The FREE breakfast whilst not being 5* is a fantastic bonus when staying here and the options vary each day. Although the choice is limited the quality is as good as any of the \u201cBreakfast Buffets\u201d available along 192. The free tea/coffee which is available all day was nice when returning to the hotel. The hotel rooms are very clean and the public areas, including the laundry facilities which are on each floor, are kept in an excellent condition.

Being honest the only thing that may effect some people who aren\u2019t early risers (aren\u2019t you going to a theme park! and we only noticed as our room was right at the end of the corridor), is the field to the right of the hotel is sometimes used for hot air balloon flights but the view you get of them launching is great and apart from the first time I never really heard them., Other people I spoke to didn\u2019t know that the balloons were there.

Towels were always on hand in a bin near the pool. The pool was heated and did not reek of chlorine. Kids and I swam for a whole day and did not have burning red eyes.

Usually didn't have to wait long...but it is what it is. All in all, I don't think you can find a better value in Kissimmee.

We borrowed paper plates and plastic cutlery from the Restaurant as and when we needed it which worked fine. There is a safe but you have to pay $3 dollars a night so bear that in mind as a cost. The complimentary self service breakfast was of a good standard with a selection of cereals, fruits, juices available plus fresh waffles along with scrambled egg, bacon, sausage and beans - it doesn't change though so you may want to alternate with going out for breakfast every other day as we did. Restaurant not open for dinner so only food available in the hotel was from the pool bar which was pretty basic. Pretty of choice from all the major Restaurant chains on your doorstep although you will need to drive as it is along a 2/3 mile strip.

The hotel is tucked away from the busy 192 highway, so you don't get much noise or traffic which is nice. huge parking lot that was barely full when we were there (off season though). Check in at 3p, check out at 11a The hotel had a friendly front counter staff and some nice included amenities: -breakfast buffet (7am-10am) which included hot and cold items, restocked quick so stuff doesn't run out, and large dining area -mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker in room -laundry, ice, and vending machines on each floor -free WIRED internet in room, wifi in public spots...if you want wifi in your room, better pack a wifi hotspot -free shuttles to parks (with fine print - see below) -game room for kids, fitness room, and 24-hr pool -free parking The room we were in was a King Studio (king bed + sleeper sofa)...it was nice, nothing too fancy about it. I appreciated that the room was quiet but that could of been due to the off-season emptiness. The room had a connecting door to the room next to us, I heard the people's TV next door every morning...so just be aware of that. We were at the end of the hallway, so I didn't hear too much hallway noise. The hotel also charged us a $2-something daily resort fee, which is no big deal to me for all the stuff they provide. This is a separate fee charged during checkout if you book through a travel site. So the shuttle service is pretty lame in my opinion and I was thankful we had a rental car. The lady at the counter there was a bit rude too. If you want to use the shuttle you must sign-up before hand at the counter. There are limited seats so be sure to sign up asap. It does not go to Animal Kingdom, so if you want to go there, you go to take a shuttle to Magic Kingdom or Epcot and transfer from there using Disney's system. I mean if you want to save money from not having a rental car, use the shuttles. I was thankful that I could come and go as I please from the parks. The times were as follows (pickup / drop off): Magic Kingdom: 7:05a / 5:45p, 8:45p, 10:15p Epcot: 10:35a, 11:20a / 10:05p Hollywood Studios: 10:35a / 8:55p Universal: 7:50a / 7:15p SeaWorld: 7:50a / 7:30p There was fast food places and a grocery store nearby and also a walgreens. Across the street is a little family amusement park type place with carnival games, rides, and a go-cart track. We walked through there one night and it was \"meh-sketchy\", I think it'd be better to just use the game room in the hotel hah. I highly recommend to stay clear of the Old Town area...that place was sketchy at night! I mean, we walked by it our first night and there was a sign that said \"don't display your colors\"...that should of been a tip. Walked through there and it was biker bars and sketch crowd. We walked in and practically ran back to the hotel hah! That would be my only negative about the area. A good tip as well...if you're driving to the hotel from the 192, just turn on Florida Plaza Blvd. GPS might say to take Holiday Trail but that way is a bit longer and you have to drive through Old Town that has a stop sign for pedestrian traffic which can be a bit slow at times. Overall a good place to stay, I would stay there again and recommend it to friends...unless I found a similar place that was even more close to the parks or offered something better, or nicer area. It was a nice hotel with no issues, and when traveling, that's all I really ask for.

Room was big enough for what we needed. There was 5 in our room, so we had to use the sofa bed but this wasn't an issue. Beds were comfy, some complain they are too soft but after a long day at the theme parks i know i could of slept on a park bench! Microwave is handy for reheating pizza etc. Bathroom is big, however water from shower and tap can be a little smelly. Pool was big and was rarely full, only a few sun loungers however so if it did get full there would be a problem. The pool bar is open from 3, and happy hour is from 5-7 p.m.. We didn't need to use the kids pool but it seemed okay, hot tub is lush! very hot however so i wouldn't recommend it for children. Staff at pool bar don't seem very interested in what they are doing, but there we go. Food from pool bar is good and cheap. We ate at the hotel a couple nights when we couldn't be bothered to go anywhere else. The raccoon mentioned in other reviews does appear sometimes! however it does seem friendly and doesn't come near anyone. Lifts can be slow at times, depending what time of day you use them. Wifi is good, only use it up to the 2nd floor but if your sat at the bar its good. Breakfast can be repetitive but as its free it doesn't really matter! Breakfast wasn't too busy on weekdays, however at weekends they have jehovah witness conventions so breakfast gets very busy! Shop isn't expensive in reception. In a good location, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. Shuttles get very busy and often put on more than they can handle. Drivers were a bit crazy too but they're free so you cant complain.

The hotel's situated steps away from Old Town Kissimmee, but it feels very remote - it's not overlooked by any other hotels and it's far enough from the busy main road that you aren't at all aware of any cars. It's a little far from the theme parks ($35 dollars in a cab to Universal Studios each way) but there's a free shuttle at 7.50 in the am and 7.15pm to all of the main parks.

We stayed 8 nights in August 2010 and were thoroughly impressed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, soundproof and large. There was a laundry room on each floor ($1/wash and $1/dry), as well as a pop machine and ice. The conceirge was helpful, the pool and pool area clean and the breakfast was a great value. There is coffee available 24 hours/day. There is a fitness centre and a business centre. The pool area has a bar that also serves small lunch meals and snacks in the afternoon until about 11:00pm. A few glitches: there are 2 elevators and during busy times - usually in the morning - you have to wait quite awhile. The shuttle times to Disney World are quite limited so you have to plan your trips accordingly. If you don't want to wait for the shuttle, cab fare is approx. $20 each way. AREA INFO: Old Town is across the street and is wonderful place to wander around, Check out their website at www.old-town.com. There's something going on there until 11:00pm. Pirates Cove mini-golf is next door to the hotel and is a fun place. There are 2 courses on the property. Adults cost $9.95/round. There are several restaurants withing walking distance. Here's my opinion on the ones we ate at: Red Lobster - great, Logan's Steakhouse - okay, Pacino's Italian - great, Ponderosa - good, Full House Chinese Buffet - not good, Bennigan's - good, Olive Garden (took a cab) - great., Flippers Pizza in Old Town - great, Kool Katz in Old Town - not good. OTHER INFO: We arranged airport transportation through Happy Limosine. It cost about $50 more than an airport shuttle (return) but we didn't have to wait for others or stop at other hotels and they include a 15 mintue grocery stop on the way to our hotel. Our driver stopped at Publix's and we were able to pick up some bottled water and snacks. It was great to have this out of the way and not have to find somewhere near the hotel.

The hotel provides a shuttle service to the main parks but the return times from seaworld and universal are 7.30 - 7.45 so if you want to stay later than that a cab back would cost up to $40. The Linx bus service worked out much cheaper for us on the occasions that we missed the shuttle bus back as it stops on the 192 right next to old town. The hotel won't give info on the linx buses but timetables are available on the buses. We didn't use the hotel snack bar but found a couple of good places to eat on the other side of the 192, although crossing that is not for the faint hearted!! We'd recommend Bennigans and Logans Roadhouse though get here early as it fills up pretty quickly! We travelled here with Virgin and their nearest welcome meeting is at Best Western Lakeside or at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney both of which are $20 -$25 cab ride.

Although some of the noise travelled, we were so tired out from our days at the theme parks that it didn't keep us awake. The only thing we didn't love about this place was that the shuttle bus was a bit traumatic! It went all round the houses, sometimes crammed more people on than there were seats for and the buses were generally a bit old and uncomfortable.

Decor is bright and cheery, grounds were clean, and our room was spacious and comfortable. Location is set back off the busy street so it is very quiet. Negatives are the TV is an old 25-inch CRT; would've been nice to have a flat screen instead, and the free internet in the room was wired, not wireless.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mobile, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel.

Food: Breakfast in the morning was good and offered several hot items instead of just cold continental items, although I really didn't understand the baked beans available every morning. The country gravy was good and filling for a day walking around in the parks. If a family with teenagers does the math on this part of the deal, they will realize quickly this is an awesome value considering how much it costs to feed a family with teenagers. Bar: The bar was a nice place to hang out after a long day of walking around. Prices were fair and the selection was ample. Location: It is just minutes away from Disney, Universal, and Sea World. There was also a little fair close to the hotel with carnival rides. Pool and Hot Tub: It was a little cool when we arrived there, so it was great that the pool was heated. They kept this area very clean and well maintained as well. An added bonus is that these areas were open 24 hours a day. Fitness center: The equipment had a good enough assortment of cardio and weights to keep up with any fitness routine. The weights even had enough weight to give my sons (190lbs each) enough resistance to have some challenge. Downside 1: The elevator was slow and overcrowded. The hotel was full when we stayed, so this cause a little bit of a delay. However, we were on vacation so it was not an issue. Downside 2: There was light coming through the door from the corridor.

We planned a trip for Florida and decided to stay in Kissimmee. I had stayed there when I was younger and it was always a great vacation. Looking for hotels in Kissimmee we noticed that many of the old hotels we stayed at before were now closed down, but came across Comfort Suites on-line. We looked at the pictures and read some reviews and we were sold. We booked in early September for 12 nights. Upon arriving we realized it was the off season and that the hotel was almost empty. During our 12 nights there we only noticed an increased crowd during the weekend. The hotel main lobby is bright, colorful, and immaculately clean. Everything is well marked and the hotels various awards are in plain sight. The main lobby includes a games room to keep kids occupied, a small gym with about 10 machines just down the hall, a small store for necessities (fairly priced), and a large dining area for the Free Breakfast which is by far the best part of this hotel. The staff were friendly and efficient and we were checked in in no time at all. Staying on the 5th floor we had a view of Old Town and the Fun Zone across the street. The rooms are huge! Extremely clean and well furnished for the price. The bathrooms are well designed and the shower is rather large. Within a few hours of unpacking we headed to the large heated swimming pool, with hot tub and kiddie pool. The deck was clean, clutter free, with a nice pool-side bar which was also fairly priced. When checking in the hotel gives you coupons for 1/2 price drinks at the bar, as well a bundle of coupons for restaurants in the area. I will definitely book at this hotel and have stayed once since my trip in September, we just stayed there in early March.

The room was big enough for my husband and myself and our 14 and 20 yr old. The pool was nice and warm and never crowded. The poolside restaurant depended on which bartender was working...it was just okay. In a pinch it worked. After a long day at the park it was to have something available where we didn't have to leave. We loved the location and are planning a trip back to the area. This was absolutely perfect for going to the parks. We did not run into bad traffic once. Given that we live in a town of 900 people I was surprised as I had anticipated much worse. Room was good and clean. We requested extra shampoo and soap, etc and left a tip...we had more than enough supplies for the entire week. Try out Old Town on Wednesday night if you have time. They have a Elvis impersonator that was really fun. I am pretty sure it is every Wednesday night, but check out Old Town's website if you are interested. Park was incredibly hot in the middle of the day. Minnesota does not have humidity even close to this. I truly recommend going back to your hotel and getting out of the heat for a while. Even with teenagers you tend to get crabby and tired after too much sun. Having a car was really nice. I would rent one if you can budget it. We loved Steak and Shake-cheap burgers and shakes which the kids loved. Also would recommend the Texas Roadhouse- really good ribs. Didn't care for the chinese place located across the street from the hotel. It was a buffet and just okay. The breakfast everyday was crowded in the morning. Sometimes the groups could be watched and disciplined better. After 7 days it got a little boring, but it was something and it gave my husband and I someplace to go while the kids slept in and we could plan our day. Our gps came in really handy. You can download POI on mousesavers.com. Worked out perfectly. Ultimately we really liked this hotel. It was perfect for our price range. We paid about $75/night not including tax.

The hotel was very clean and the maid was very accomodating after we had a couple of illnesses and couldn't leave the room when she arrived to clean it. The pool area is fine however i was suprised to find a heated pool. It was 95 degrees during our stay and it offered no help when trying to cool off. It was like jumping into a bath. While the complimentary breakfast's welcome i do object to eating off polystyrene plates with plastic cutlery. Also it would've been nice if the hotel had a lounge to relax in after a day at the parks. A few whicker chairs in the lobby isn't good enough in my opinion. A lastly they should sort the lifts out. 2 for 185 rooms isn't enough and the stairs are at the end of the corridor and not really well signposted which means those that would normally walk down from floors 2/3 waited for the lift. This meant that those up on the 6th/7th floors had to stop on every floor on the way down.

They did not disappoint - the room had two double beds, plus a large seating area, which was great as there were 3 adults in the room and it gave us a bit of breathing space, and somewhere to put 3 suitcases without falling over them all the time! The breakfast was great, with hot and cold selections, and something to suit even the pickiest teenager! As advised by other reviewers on this site, we requested a room overlooking the pool, as apparently rooms on the front could be noisy. They complied with this request, and we had a room on the second floor, which was perfect. The pool was nice and great to come home to after a hot sticky day, as it remains open 24 hours. There is a pool bar/snack bar which serves excellent pizzas and other hot food which can be delivered to the room. My only criticism of this is that it does not open until 3 o'clock which is a shame if like us you would like some lunch before hitting the parks for the afternoon and evening. The location was very close to Disney and within walking distance of Old Town with its shops and fairground, which comes alive on weekends when there is a parade of vintage cars. Sea World and Universal Studios were quickly reached by a 20-minute drive along highway I4. My only criticism of the location would be that although it is very close to highway 192, the only restaurants within walking distance are Red Lobster and Pizza Hut. Logan's Roadhouse is an excellent steakhouse a short drive away and Ponderosa is a cheaper option where the steaks were very good. You can see this from the hotel but you try crossing highway 192 on foot! We made a few abortive attempts and then gave up and went back for the car! All in all, a great stay, but we probably prefer International Drive as a location because of the huge numbers of restaurants and shops that can be reached on foot.

These suites provide everything a family of four could need. We stayed here for three weeks and found it excellent throughout. Firstly, this is a 3*, so it's not a 'luxury' hotel, but it is extremely nice and I would rate it at 3.5 stars. It is clean and spacious, and has great facilities. There's a pool, kids' pool and jacuzzi, pool bar and grill, gym, shop with photo service and free coffee all day. And there's a free breakfast, which is excellent. There's also free ice, air con, and laundry service. Our room had 2 queen beds plus a sofa bed. Also had a hairdryer, fridge and coffee/tea making facilities, plus free internet access which was great as we took our laptop. Plenty of room for 4 of us for three weeks. Rooms were cleaned to a very high standard every day. The only moan about the hotel would be the pushy salespeople who reside in the lobby. They try to get you to view a timeshare in exchange for some tickets, and if you speak to them, you can be there for over an hour!! Just say NO, and they'll leave you alone for the rest of your stay. The location is also excellent for eating and drinking and entertainment in the evening. 2 minutes walk from about 30 restaurants at Old Town and just across the road on the 192. There's also a funfair and go-karts at Old Town, and the world's tallest skytower. Huge!! There's also crazy golf and a shop within two minutes walk. Obviously most people have a car, but there are free shuttles to the major parks. We drove, and it's 2 mins from Disney parks and about 20 minutes from Universal/Seaworld. Overall, I cannot fault Comfort Suites as it's very good value for money, with everything a family could want in terms of the standard of accommodation, facilities and location.

Staff very helpful at check in. Breakfast great a good choice of food for everyone in our party. Pool area clean and tidy, hot tub a blessing after a busy day. Pool bar Barracuda Bart's good value for money, quick service. One thing I have noticed is quite a few people who have reviewd this hotel have passed a comment on lifts being slow or not working. The other morning we were on our way for breakfast and one lift got stuck on our floor (6th floor), on the way back from breakfast, staff were saying we could use the service lift although there was still one working. Engineer was on site repairing. Later that day both lifts in full working order. Room very clean and housekeeper very friendly and if you ask for anything its sorted. Only real problem we have had is with the shuttle bus from the hotel to the theme parks, that also calls in to a few other hotels on the way ( I know this is not the hotels fault. This is our 1st time to America and we did not fancy hiring a car.) They go out at 8am and 12.10pm to Magic Kingdom and one at 10.20am to Epcot. Coming home 6.00pm and 10.00pm from Magic Kingdom. What you dont realise straight away is they have one leaving Epcot at 9.45pm this then goes to the Magic Kingdom to become the 10.00pm bus so if it is half full at Epcot and a lot of people get on at the Magic Kingdom you end up standing up on the journey back to the hotel. One night in particular we were all packed in like a tin of sardines. Also you cannot watch the fireworks in the Magic Kingdom if you want to get 10.00pm shuttle as they start at the same time so if you want to watch them you need to jump a taxi back.

What a sense of relief I felt when we drove up. Everything looked exactly like the pictures. The lobby was nice but not stuffie the first contact personnel were laid back but yet professional. They do send you to get your parking pass from a time share solicitor but I just I'm divorced and that took care of the spiel. My room was exactly what I saw online. Location- excellent!

We had pre-booked our room many weeks in advance based on the reviews from this site. We were given a room right off of the lobby next to the weight room on the main floor. The staff checking us in stated that it was late and that was all he had. I questioned this as they knew we were coming and we had guaranteed a room for nine nights on our credit card. With the 3 hour time zone difference for us, everyone was up early to go to their activities. They were loud and we were woken up after a short sleep to hear all the chatter and noise from the lobby. The staff at the front desk was helpful and moved us to a room higher up and away from the elevators, pop and ice machines. What a difference. It was a regular room. No compensation for the inconvenience of noise and having to move. The rest of the stay was quiet except for July 3rd and it sounded like someone was being asked to leave but we only heard the protests as they walked by our room, not what ever the precipitating event was. July 4th was party night. It was a celebration and the WDW fireworks were the best we have ever experienced. The rooms were clean on the surface, but after the 3rd cleaning, we had a sock and some other stuff on our coffee table that did not belong to us. Something fell behind the dresser, and it was not very clean back there. Otherwise the bathroom, and room were clean. No offencive odours, and that is a challenge is such a humid climate. The safe in our room did not work. Breakfast was great. Met our needs, and there was a great variety. We are not into doughnuts, but loved the waffles yogurt and fresh fruit. The coffee was fresh and there was lots of it! That goes for the food too. We were usually part of the early crowd, so we never had to wait long for our fresh waffles. The pool was beautifully landscaped. I liked that it was open all night. Everyone during our stay was enjoying their time in the pool playing and laughing, yet were never obnoxiously loud disturbing those sleeping in rooms off of the pool. It was such a relief after a hot day at Disney to be able to cool down in the pool. The raccoons are cute and smart, starting at one garbage can and working around to the others. The staff do not encourage their visits, and guests seemed to be afraid of them for the most part. They can be rabid, so it is wise to stay clear of them, but they are not known to attack if left alone. They have a routine and I did not see them approach any of the guests. The elevators are slow. We were on the 6th floor and would take the stairs. With it being so hot, the stairwells are not air conditioned and by the time you hit the 6th floor you would be soaked and hot. Did not need the fitness centre... Someone had spilled a cup of coffee in the stairwell by the door, and the staff had that cleaned up very quickly. The fridge was very handy. We froze bottles of water and were able to have cold water well into the day. The location is very convenient. Our Google directions were not as easy to follow as they should have been. It is not hard to get to the hotel from the airport. Be aware that some of the toll booths are not manned late at night and change is required. Keep a load of quarters with you just in case. Tolls varied from 50 cents to $1.25. WDW is easy to get to. Traffic on July 4th was challenging, but that was the only time. Traffic moves well. Signage to WDW is great. Returning to the hotel, we followed the signs to 192, but almost missed the right hand peel off to Kissimmee as that info was not visible until after the peel off. Thankfully with few cars around we could pull over the 3 lanes and still make it onto 192 in the correct direction. It would be nice with the Epcot theme being such an important one, if this hotel could have recycling bins for paper, plastic, glass and cans. We would take our beverage containers to WDW to dispose of them there. It broke my heart to have to throw paper and glass away. What amazing beds and pillows. ZZZZZZ I was concerned that the hotel would not be what was claimed in the ratings, but we were so very pleased to have had a great time there. We have stayed on the WDW properties in the past, and have not felt as good as we did here.

We chose this hotel through Tripadvisor the first visit (December 2006) when we travelled to Orlando as a couple, and therefore it was a natural choice for our first stay in Orlando with our daughter (18 months). This time around, we knew we needed a suite in order to put our daughter in the \"living room\" in her playpen while we slept in the king-sized bed in the adjoining bedroom. We chose this suite because there was a door that shut between the two rooms instead of just a half wall as a divider like a lot of other suites we had seen. We paid a bit more than a regular room but it was so worth it for our comfort and sleep! The hotel is simply a nice, plain, ordinary, comfortable hotel. Perfectly clean in the rooms, communal areas are also comfortable and functional. The front desk service was perfectly fine, and although the Disney salespeople at the desk couldn't offer any better deal on a 1-day ticket than at the gate, they never hassled us or tried any hard sale tactic. The pool is medium sized and perfectly clean and servicable. The hot tub is large and often empty. There is a small \"baby\" pool with a sprinkler type of \"mushroom\" that rains down. It is freezing cold and not recommended for babies! Quick note to all that say that breakfast is \"free\". It is not \"free\", it is included in your price. That being said, breakfast is ok, nothing to write home about. Mickey shaped waffles are probably the highlight. Hard boiled eggs, cereals, yogurts, powdered eggs (ugh), juices, and bacon round out the comprehensive breakfast. The tables can be hard to come by if you come at peak times, and slightly sticky from all that syrup! The suite was a real jem however. A large kitchen area led through to a living room area with couch, chair and tv. The master bedroom with king sized bed and large dressing area which led to the large bathroom. Plenty of room to spare for our small family. The cons: the kitchen has nothing in it, not even a spork. If you want to use the microwave or keep food in the fridge, you'll have to buy plates, napkins, bowls, cutlery, the works. Not even a bottle opener to be found. Other cons: The internet access is through a cable, and the cable hookup is in the kitchen area. Because our daughter napped in the living room area, I couldn't work in the kitchen area as they are open to each other. I tried to run the cable under the double door to the master bedroom but it was so short I ended up sitting on the floor to work. It would be nice to get another internet jack in the bedroom. As others have said, the pizza flyers under the door are inconvenient, but really, if picking up a couple of flyers from the floor is biggest hassle in your day, you've had a pretty good day!

Although lots of people came for the free breakfast, tables were constantly being cleared, and food constantly being replaced, so nothing ever \"ran-out\"! It was a real plus to start the day. Breakfast ran every day from 7:00 A.M.-10:00 A.M. 2. Free transportation to Theme Parks-my wife & I used the free bus service every day for a week to get to Disney World parks. The buses were ALWAYS on time for pick-up(3 times in the morning) and return to the hotel(three times in the late afternoon/evening). Pick up hours varied from 8:00 A.M. to Noon and return time from 6:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. This alone saved us $12.00 parking fee per day, and the aggravation of parking & walking to the front gate(or taking a tram ). The buses went into only one Disney park per trip(varied during morning & afternoon), but Disney buses took us to the park we wanted, quickly & efficiently & free. Same for Universal Park for drop-off & pick-up. 3. Rooms were very clean, cheery with microwave & fridge. Washroom was extra large with excellent shower in the tub. Room was cleaned well every day with lots of EXTRA towels supplied each & every day, plus soap, conditioner, shampoo & lotion. Everyone in hotel was friendly. Location of hotel, just two miles east of Disney property was a real plus with lots of restaurants nearby.

The room was large (2 beds, a small kitchenette area and a proper bathroom) with views over the pool. It was immaculate and every time we returned to it after an exhausting day at the parks etc. it looked great. Our housekeeper was called Svetlana - we met her on our 2nd day - and she was charming. Needless to say, we left her a good tip at the end of our stay! The system here is an envelope with the housekeeper's name on it and room for comments, a good idea so that the tip goes to the right person. The hotel is right opposite Old Town which is starting to look rather run-down, it now has lots of fairly tacky fairground rides which is a shame as it used to be quaint and had an Olde Towne atmospherere. However there are LOTS of good restaurants around within walking distance, a special mention for Red Lobster at the top of Florida Plaza Blvd as their serving staff are excellent!! Food is good too!! On the subject of food - unless you are desperate and/or tired - I wouldn't bother with the Barracuda Bart's poolside bar. The menu is limited, overpriced and almost inedible.

I read all the reviews and was most impressed. I have to say that I wasn't disappointed at all when we arrived there. The hotel is close to the Disney Parks (about 10-15 minutes by free shuttle), which was the main reason I booked there. They also offer a free hot breakfast daily which was great! Most reviews say that the breakfast room filled up quickly but we didn't see that as we were always there just after 7am each day. Free shuttles to Disney departed at 8am, 10am and 12:30pm daily. The hotel also offered free shuttles to return in the evening but these buses filled to the absolute maximum and could take up to 1 hour to get back to the hotel. This was not so great but we did it for 5 days as we didn't have our own car. Hotel is very clean, beds are comfortable and staff very nice to deal with. Our 1 bedroom suite was on the 6th floor and contained 2 queen sized beds in the one room and a kitchenette. A day into our stay, we realised that we really wanted a separate room for the adults so we enquired at the front desk as to the possibility of changing rooms. They couldn't have been more hospitable and found us an amazing 2 room suite with KSB and pull out sofa in separate room. We had 2 huge bathrooms and a great view of the pool (which unfortunately we never got to use as we spent all our time at the Disney Parks!). The rooms are huge, plenty of space to move around even with 6 suitcases! The only complaint I have is that you would expect a room with a kitchenette to have the basic essential items, (plates, utensils, glasses etc.. ) available for its guests to use. But there was NOT A THING in the cupboards and drawers, so we had to purchase disposable items from the nearest supermarket. There also isn't a lockable safe in the room which meant that I had to lock our personal documents and cash in our suitcase. The safe is in the cupboard as they advertise but there isn't a lock on it (I found this to be the case in both the rooms we stayed in, so perhaps they want their guests to use a safe in their lobby). The hotel is located just behind \"Old Town\" which is an amusement park that comes to life in the evenings. There is a Red Lobster restaurant about 1 minute walk away - really great staff and delicious food (highly recommended). On the highway nearby are many chain restaurants like Ponderosa (inexpensive & edible), Pacino's (Italian, so-so food) and many others. On the night of our arrival we took a cab to the Premium outlet mall (20 minutes by cab) and stayed there until 10:30pm (most nghts it's open until 11pm). There are a lot of really good stores there and you an pick up a good bargain if you have the energy to sift through it all. We purchased our 5 day Disney tickets at the tours counter at the hotel. It saved us the long lines at Disney itself and allowed us to walk right in. Just remember that in Orlando everything is far away (in distance) so unless you have your own car , definitely take a cab! I needed to see a doctor during our stay and was told that the nearest medical centre was down the road. Down the road is actually 20-30 minutes by cab, so don't be fooled.

I also asked for a connecting rooms so I could have my teenage nephews in the connecting room near us. Last was for the rooms to be near each other. I got none of my requests. The woman at the front desk just kept repeating to me of how I just made a request but had to take what is available when I checked in. Never looking up at me, she just kept playing with the computer. We were placed on the top of the hotel on the 7th floor at the end of the hall near the maintenance room. One of the elevators were broken for part of the stay. Huge problem with a power wheelchair. No connecting room but joining-got a lecture on that by the women at the desk looking at the computer too. The boys ended up across the hall. And only a couple of the rooms were near each other. Mother in law was 4 floors below. I got a lecture from her too. I got the complaints from the group. The rooms had black mold in the bathrooms. Toilets didn't work. A room near my sisters had a water problem and the equipment cleaning it was very loud. Then when the staff walked out of the room they yelled at girls for being loud in the hallway because people could be sleeping. No one could have been sleeping with the noise the staff was making. They heard the front desk call people names after the guest got in the elevator. Kitchen staff was eating waffles over the waffle tray during the breakfast serving time. I won't be staying there again mostly because I don't want to hear the complaints and do not want to be on the top floor with a child who has too much medical equipment to be carried down the stairs when the elevators don't work.

We chose this hotel for it's proximity to Disney & also Old Town, which is a very good 'base' for returning from the parks at night, & also a varied choice of restraunts nearby. Had a lovely 'King' suite - huge bed, very comfortable, wish I could have taken it home. Big bathroom to go with it. This is undoubtedly the best hotel we have ever stayed at in Kissimmee/Orlando. It was quite expensive, but this because of time of year, it got very much cheaper after 1st January, for the remainder of our stay. I requested a high floor & front facing, looking out towards Old Town. You could see the fireworks from the Disney parks out the window, any nights we happened to be in the hotel before they started. You can park the car in the car-park & walk along to Old Town should you wish to have a beer in some livelier atmosphere. The breakfast, which many raved about in previous reviews, was not up to much. Eggs/beans/ Sausage gravy (kind of cheesy sauce with broken bits of sausage throught it , Waffles,biscuits. Cereal/yogurt etc. Really, it's a minor grumble, the rest of the hotel made up for it. Ok if you have hungry kids to feed without the expense of going out, but being only a couple with grown up kids, we chose to eat out most mornings. 24hr pool was exactly as it said - always plenty towels, really warm water, all the time. The jaccuzzi pool was excellent as well, water was roasting. Always plenty car-parking space. Always hot coffee in the dining room 24hrs. Found Racoons raking in the bins behind the car-park after returning one night. We used to bring back scraps to feed them after that. They are amusing to watch, but they take off quickly if you get to close. As hotel has a lot of vegitation behind it, guess that's where they stay. We loved this hotel - was a pleasure to come back to after our days out. We will definitely stay here on our future visits to the area, it has everything we wanted. Cannot rate it highly enough.

I not only use the website but preach it to others for it's non-biased approach. After the second time staying at a \"top rated\" resort and coming back with it's ok attitude, I realized that you must read between the lines. A huge red flag is when you are staying in a town and the top rated restaurant is a mediocre chain establishment. The town itself, \"Kissimmee\" is a tourist trap of bad chain restaurants and hokie gift shops and phony knock-off outlets. The hotel is located quite nicely off the main drag behind old town (cheesy, but fun carnival type place). Let me start off by saying the entire place is very clean. The staff is very friendly and handles any issues quite well. The pool area is very nice and a child's dream. The outdoor bar is below par but serves it's purpose. The rooms are of a good size but not huge. There are 2 elevators which are very slow and if you are on a higher floor can be very nerve racking. There are 7 floors in all. Here's some stuff that doesn't sound major but when you stay there it is. The towels by the pool could be used to sand wood. If you are flying Southwest and need a computer to pre-check in, plan on spending .25 cents a minute on the hotels computer and a dollar per page to print. Couldn't this service be free? The free breakfast is not scrumptious, delicious, fabulous and any other adjective I have heard it described. It is packed egg mix, frozen sausage, frozen biscuits, yogurt, bread, cereal etc. By day three you won't even go to it. Not to mention the eating area is packed. The hotel is close to all parks and attractions, but you will need a car. The beds are above average and the pillows are nice down alternative instead of those neck ache cheap foam rubber jobs. The bottom line is that this is the number one hotel in the area. There is no competition. Kissimmee is littered with cheap 39.00 a night places. This hotel is nice. At a hundred bucks a night I guess it has good value. If this is just another trip for you to Florida it will probably due.

Our family (13 yr old son) typically stays at Hilton and Marriott family hotels and we have stayed in Comfort Suites on two occasions. We take 3 vacations a year and with the price of Disney we decided to look for a better hotel price close to the park. It has been 6 years since visiting Orlando and we knew that much has probably changed. We split the vacation in half by staying at Hawthorne Suites in Buena Vista first. Both hotels had a high rating and our stay at Hawthorne was pleasant and looking forward to being closer to Disney. We stayed at Kissimmee Residence Inn 11 years ago and thought the area would be good. We drove into Kissimmee and I started to wonder if the right choice was made. We drove up to the hotel and my jaw dropped because of the neighborhood and was wondering what the family thought. We went inside and the lobby was very basic like a motel and not very clean. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. We booked a suite by phone but they had us in a regular room. They were able to upgrade us to a master suite (very expensive) which we went to look at. It was big and clean but there was something about it that made me worry. As we were going back down the elevator, my wife noticed a lot of bugs on us. That is when I decided to try and get out of our reservation. The staff allowed me 1 hour to find another hotel and cancel or we would have to pay for the first night. We left and my family was so pleased that I decided to not stay at this property so we called the previous hotel and went back in to cancel. Again, they were very pleasant with canceling the reservations without any problems. I give the staff an A+ and the location an F and was very unhappy about the rating given to this hotel by travelers.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire England", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay again at the Comfort Suites\u201d", "Author": "FloridaPhil_8", "ReviewID": "UR20283644", "Content": "This was our second stay at this hotel and we really like everything it has to offer.The rooms are spacious and very clean, the free buffet breakfast is very good and the swimming pool area is usually quiet if you feel like having a relaxing day.

If you are booking using points for a free reward stay, please be sure to clarify with this hotel before arriving. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else, but I wanted to post this so others wouldn't have the same troubles. From the other reviews posted, it sounds like a good hotel otherwise. We have stayed at Choice brand name hotels quite a bit, but this was our first time using reward points for a free night's stay at a Choice Hotel. I called the hotel directly around 3 months in advance to book a room using reward points. The customer service representative stated that would be fine. I asked if she needed any of my reward numbers, and she stated that they could get them from us once we arrived. I thought that was a bit odd, so I clarified once again to see if we could use our reward points to book the stay (essentially being free.) She again said everything was booked for our reward stay. A week before our trip, I called to confirm that they still had us down for the reward stay. The representative stated that we were down for a stay, but not for a reward stay. I explained that I had booked the hotel using reward points. She stated that she had to go ask to see if that was okay. She came back on the line and stated that they could not redeem a reward stay directly and that I would have to call the corporate line to redeem the stay. I then called the corporate line, and the representative told me that this particular hotel was \"out\" of reward stays for that time period so we could not book a stay for that time. From what it sounds, each hotel is only allotted a certain amount of reward stays per night or time period. I told the representative what happened, and she told me that she could not personally do anything but instead to call the hotel manager directly and give that a try. I called the hotel back and asked to speak to the manager. I believe it was a manager, but it was not the hotel's general manager. I told him about our sticky situation and that I would appreciate any help he could give me. He was argumentative and defensive about the entire situation. I didn't mean for him to get so worked up about the whole thing. He stated the original representative never would have told me that we could book a reward stay through the hotel directly. He stated that booking reward stays was supposed to be done through the corporate line. He insinuated that I was lying by stating that he had already spoken with the original representative and per their conversation, the representative didn't even know it was possible. He stated that she did not remember our original conversation, but I said that I did as I keep detailed records. I told him that I remembered the conversation and that it matched my records. I asked if there was anything he would do, and he told me that there was nothing that he was going to do. I calmly told him that I expected better customer service, and he very boldly stated that he was providing good customer service. Not to make him look bad as I'm sure he has to deal with many issues, but that comment almost made me laugh and get mad all at the same time. I told him that we would no longer be staying at Choice hotels, and he stated that was o.k. I can definitely admit that it was partially my fault that I didn't realize we were supposed to call the corporate line to book the stay instead of the hotel line. I can also admit that all of this just sounds like a simple miscommunication. On the other hand- I also think that the hotel could have handled this in a much better way. If they would have told me to call the corporate line in the first place, we could have avoided this whole mess. It made me feel a little upset as we had stayed so many nights in Choice hotels previously that I felt like I had earned that reward stay. (Actually we spent so many nights that we were Platinum members.) I also felt belittled and treated rudely by the manager. We were planning on having a free stay through the reward points. The plane tickets were already booked, so we ended up having to spend a decent amount of non-budgeted money on another hotel that wasn't as nice. Again- if you're not booking using a reward stay- I'm sure this is a good hotel and I hope that you have a good experience.

We decided that further protest would only aggravate the situation, so we remained calm and advised that we would speak to the Virgin (our tour operator) representative the next day. This mild threat seemed to do the trick as the lady then said that if we returned early the next morning she would see what she could do. We returned to the desk at 7.30 a.m. the next morning and miraculously our requested room was available! The previous occupants must have vacated very early indeed! We have a funny feeling that the hotel keep their options open at the weekend and wanted a room that would sleep six, available for last minute bookings and placed us in a four person room.

The thing we did not like about the lift was that it was hot and the smell of breakfast seemed to linger in it a little too long! Raccoon I would warn you that the poolside raccoon is a problem. Cute as he may look, he has a penchant for Tortilla Chips, Cookies and indeed any food item you may have on you or in your bags. No food item should be left unattended. He is not afraid to steal from you even if you are in close proximity! Facilities The washing and drying machines on each floor were in good order and cost $1.00 for a wash cycle and $1.00 for a drying cycle. The hotel do not sell stamps but will frank your postcards and send out with the hotel mail at 90c for a postcard to the UK. Transport to Parks We did not use the hotel shuttle to the Parks but we were aware that there were three buses a day to the Disney Transportation and Ticket Centre, the first one leaves at 7.35a.m. There was also one bus at 9.25 a.m. to Universal/ I.o.A. On a day when my husband wanted to have a couple of glasses of wine with his meal at Epcot, we took a Taxi from the Hotel to the Transportation Centre and picked the Monorail to Epcot (you have to pay the $11.00 parking fee for the Taxi if you actually enter a Disney car park) and the fare was $25.00. The return Taxi from Epcot was $20.00. This hotel is ideally situated for all the Parks (10 minutes to Disney and Seaworld and 15 minutes to Universal and IOA) and on the couple of occasions we found the time to go to Old Town it was nice to wander around in the warm air,and sit down for a drink outside rather than in an air conditioned environment.

The breakfast is great and saves us a lot of money, as there are five of us. The beds are very comfortable and I slept like a log, which is very unusual for me to do on a bed other than my own. The pool is plain, but the kids enjoyed it. The nights we were there a large group of kids from a soccer tournament were also there, which made for a noisy hotel.

The only disadvantage to this accomodation in our opinion is tht it isn't suitable for couples staying for longer than a week (which we did) as it is catered for families which we didnt hav a problem with - the only problem we had was being disturbed during the early hours of the morning by kids shouting/screaming & running down the corridor (we were informed tht accomodation take in the \"teams\" which are groups of kids tht stay at resort during this particular time of year to do sports etc ) + people were checking into their rooms still during the early hours which was also heard. The trick is to keep the \"air-con\" on during the night (or wear ear-plugs if you are a light-sleeper) as this does drown the noises from the corridor out & people waiting for the lift (as the lift is extremely slow - they only hav the two lifts in the middle of the corridor which made a sort of \"choo choo\" noise when they arrive at your level. Having said all this we would definately stay at the Comfort Suites Maingate East again but at a different time of year - we found the \"free breakfast\" which you don't often get really handy with fresh-fruit put out every day & it doesnt matter what age you are, everyone loves those \"Mickey\" waffles.

Great stay at good price. My wife and I stayed at the Comfort Suites Main Gate east the first week of May and we're pleasantly surprised at quality of stay for the price. The hotel is just off Kissimmee's main strip, HWY 192 back behind the carnival-seque \"Fun Spot USA\" and beside the \"Old Town\" classic town walk (not that good, btw.... Its not horrible, just tourist trappy) We asked for, and received at no extra cost, a standard suite on a higher level after previous reviews encouraged avoiding the lower floors due to noise and crowds during peak season. The hotel's decor was nice and, while the elevator was a tad slow, the place is very nice.Tip #1: Book with the 'Magicard', the FREE official 'Orlando Info' tourist card which can be found by going to the 'Orlando Info' website (google it).. you can print it off, or find them in Florida Information Centers. Because we booked with the 'Magicard rate', We ended up paying only 99$ for the first night and 69$ for three more evenings. If you even mention the Magicard, you will probably save money. The suite was fantastic and did not disappoint.: It was clean, featured a Queen bed with adjacent loveseat facing a 26' TV with full cable. The bathroom was nice, clean and well stocked. The suite also had a business table beside the TV, as well as another 2 person table in the suite part, a minifridge, microwave and a mini coffee maker that was restocked every day when housekeeping came by. Free Hi speed Wireless internet was available down in the lobby. They also have free hi speed wired internet in the room with a short cord connected to the business table beside the TV. Tip# 2: Request a front facing room... while you can hear the FunSpotUSA carnival they do shut down later in the evening, its not facing the pool which could potentially get noisy, and the higher up you are the views are great at night. The breakfast., which runs 7am to 10am, is a Hot breakfast changed day to day. with the \"hot\" component being either Hard Boiled Eggs, Egg Patties with Sausage, French Toast, Biscuits and Gravy (a southern staple). There are also tons of dry/wet items like cereals, porridges, bagels, and even mini-donuts. The coffee is good and theres a nice selection of teas. Tip#3 Get to the breakfast area early, get your stuff, and eat outside by the pool. The breakfast room is small, but the perfect solution is to eat out on the pool patio. We did it every morning and it really made the experience better because it can get quite crowded for breakfast. But with the modest pricing, getting a full hot breakfast along with nice accommodations really set this place apart. There we're only two real negatives, and they we're that bad at all: 1) the volume of the in-room air conditioner/bathroom fan - a little loud at first, but soon becomes background noise that isn't noticeable at all - and 2)The timeshare info booth- near the 1st floor elevator, there is a booth with people offering timeshare info. While they are quite professional, if you engage them - like asking for attraction ticket info - they will try to get you to sign on for a free breakfast and then a presentation on timeshares. While they didnt bug us most of them time, there was one day in particular when one of the associates went out of his way to get our attention while we were heading to our room. While its understandable, since it's their job, it wasn't the nicest experience... other than that, they didn't bother you; So it wasn't really that bad. If anything, don't let that keep you from booking at this hotel. Overall, it was a great stay and well worth the money we saved and spent elsewhere instead of on a hotel room. If we ever come back to the Orlando area, this will most probably be our hotel of choice.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MRLewis1970", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experiance\u201d", "Author": "MRLewis1970", "ReviewID": "UR16198669", "Content": "We stayed at this Hotel from April 30, 2008 to May 8, 2008.

We checked in before the 3:00pm check in time - and was told the room was not ready at that time but that we could come back in about an hour. They gave us a ticket to give back to the clerk when we got back to get our keys. We went ahead and headed off to Magic Kingdom till about 7:00pm. When we got back, our keys were ready. The room was very clean. And was exceptionally nice for a 3 star hotel. Our rooms were kept clean on a daily basis - and my 3 year olds stuffed animals were always sitting up and watching for him to come back that night. I personally did not care for the mattress' just because of the firmness, but my husband thought they were fine. The pillows were outstanding - and pleanty of them. In fact upon checking with the front desk, we found out that they sell them - and that many people enjoy them. My husband is still saying he'd like to have several if we could get them. The breakfast is more than average for a hotel \"free\" breakfast. I was fine with the choices available - but my husband was not real thrilled. Just nothing he cared for. If they would add bagels of some kind that might help. We're used to bagels almost every morning. But they do have a good selection. Waffels are great - and they have different toppings for them - such as strawberrys and whipped topping. Everything about the hotel that we encountered was very clean. And maybe because of the time that we went - we never encountered any problems with the elevator. May have to wait a few minutes at times, but nothing major.

Breakfast was great, even my skeptical husband who used to do continental breakfasts for a choice hotel thought that this breakfast was exceptional. They even have flavored coffee creams and both fruit toppings and whipped cream for the waffles. The pool area is really nice, they offer $1 draft beer from 4-7 at the poolside bar. The room was always clean, and my kids rushed into the bathroom to see what towel creature was left for us, and looked around for where their toys had been placed. It made our stay that much more special. There are lots of shops in oldtown, we did not find the sales people there very friendly, but it you walk up to 192, there is a flea market and several resteraunts. There is a Publix within walking distance for even my 4yo, we grabbed a cab back from there though because we had too much to carry with us. The shuttle was a good deal if you don't want to rent a car. Getting to downtown Disney is quite a trip, and the times are not always convienent, but overall we were happy to relax in the air conditioned bus and let someone else worry about getting us back to the hotel. The shuttle always plays a movie to keep the kids occupied which was really nice. Even though we went during a slow time, the shuttle got pretty full and some people had to stand, something to consider if you are going during peak season. One day we grabbed the Linx bus from disney transportation center, it went to oldtown quickly and was only 1.75 per adult, kids were free. I think it is more difficult going other places though. The only complaint that we had about the hotel was that there were no luggage racks availavle when we arrived, and the staff did not offter to help us with the luggage or try to locate one for us.

I cannot fault this hotel at all. The rooms are very clean, the maids do an excellent job every single morning, always leaving you a nice, clean place to come into. They change the beds every 3 days, which is more than ample for most people. We were in a King size suite, and the bed was massive....i'm 6\"2, and I couldnt touch my wife when I woke in the middle of the night!!! (Bonus or not? You decide!). The location is excellent. You are 2 minutes walk from Old Town and all it has to offer, and a further 2 minutes will take you to Ponderosa, IHOP, Denny's, KFC, Burger King, Sizzlin Grill and Pacino's, so if you aint too struck on driving to eat, you don't have to. The 192 is close, as is Old Town, and you do hear some \"white noise\" from Old Town on a Friday/Saturday night, but when the air con is on in the room, it is very, very faint, and it certainly didnt keep me up , and I am a light sleeper. The complimentary breakfast i good every morning, with a meat choice, biscuits, gravy, egg choice, waffles, donuts etc etc. It isn't as good as you would get if you paid for it, but hey, you don't have to. It's very tasty, and you can eat as much as you like. It does get busy in the breakfast hall though, you are better to get there before 8am to ensure you have a table. There are only two elevators for 7 floors, and yes sometimes you have to wait a minute or two, but the stairs are accessible from the far end of the lobby. We used the elevators only when we had armfuls of stuff anyway. The staff on the front desk and in the bar and dining area are friendly and helpful, always trying their best to answer any queries you may have. The concierge desk is actually timeshare, and they only approached me once, and were easily got rid of. They aren't pushy unless you approach them. I left a couple of buxcks every morning for the cleaning lady, as they really do an excellent job, and I got the cleanest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The pool area is also cleaned first thing in the morning, as it can get a lot of towels that certain lazy individuals don't put bac lying around, but by 0730am it is clean as a whistle. The prices here are very good. Granted, you will not get the same standard of facilities you would in a 5 star hotel, but then again, you aren't paying for that here. What you get for your money is excellent, large, clean rooms, a delicious breakfast every morning and excellent customer service.

I simply did not find anything cheerful in it as others had stated. It looked simply depressing. * We also had the fun of experiencing the bus loads and bus loads of teenagers. Granted, they have a right to be there as anyone else, but I find it irresposible of a hotel to book that many at one time. *The elevators were slow but I'm sure it had more to do with the amount of people using it rather than any maintenence issue. *The rooms are very below standard. I have stayed in many all suite hotels and I found this one to have the least amount of space in them compared to a regular suite. It is not much larger than a regular hotel room. *The carpet had not been vacuumed. *The walls had chipped paint. *The bathroom had hair and soap scum in it. *The furniture was chipped and scratched and old. *The window had hand prints on it. It stayed this way for the entire stay even though I asked it be cleaned. *The pool was green....really dirty. There was about 3 clean towels at the pool area. The rest of the towels were all dirty in a big heaping pile and thrown randomly on the pool area grounds. *Breakfast was very large with a big variety. We decided to eat elsewhere though as there was a huge line and no tables to be had. * I can't really comment on the friendliness of the staff as I really didn't see many around. They were nonexsistent. *The sheets barely fit the beds. At least not in the room I stayed in. They were both flat sheets. When you pulled the top sheet up to get in, the bottom sheets pulled out from being tucked in. It was very uncomfortable. *The area around the hotel was questionable. It would be a great spot for bikers and partiers and smokers. I did not feel safe in the Old Towne area. I'm surprised at the reviews this hotel receives. Talking with fellow guests during my stay, it seemed we all felt the hotel was unacceptable. The rates are cheap and unfortunately the hotel reflects that. If you are used to economy hotels then this one would probably be ok for you. If you have stayed in nicer, higher priced hotels before, then this is a step down and you will be disappointed.

You can't hear any of the noise from Old Town when you're at the hotel.

We were due to arrive on April 8. I booked through hotels.com. I called to confirm the night before and was told that my reservation had been cancelled since the April 2nd!!!!!! There was nothing they could do. I would have to deal with it through hotels.com. I told them I needed a room and she said sorry were booked. At this point I am freaking out. I called hotels.com and they said they had not cancelled the reservation and they put me on hold and called the hotel. The girl who answered told hotels.com they had received a fax cancelling the reservation. Hotels.com said they had sent no such fax. The girl then looked for the fax but could not find it because it did not exsist. Hotels.com informed them they had to reinstate my reservation. So when I called back the girl stated I had 2 reservations and when I cancelled the first one, it cancelled out both of them. But I worked at a hotel for 10 years and know that a computer does not cancel reservations, the hotel had to do it themselves, for whatever reason. So, we get there and I am checked in as the person at the front desk is watching the people in the gift shop to make sure they are not stealing. Um, shouldn't they have someone for that? So, we get to the room and it is serious need of update. Really ugly. So, we go to get something to eat and there are bikers and shady looking people in the old town area. And lots of bars. It didn't seem family friendly. Then the next day after a long day at the parks we come back to take a swim and there are literally 100 hundred kids in the lobby going up the elevator. It took forever. Then we go to the pool and it is all green, but of course my kids want to swim. So of course the hundred kids come down to swim also. Not good. We couldn't use the hot tub because it was packed with rowdy teenagers. Needless to say the next day at breakfast was insane and packed and loud and not that great. We found out these busses were leaving that day so we decided to try one more night. So we went to the parks and come back and there are 4 more busses pulling in!!!!!!! So, the whole night and breakfast was a repeat of the first, but with even more teenagers. I had completely had it and called hotels.com and said I hated the hotel and I wanted to check out. So they called the hotel and the hotel said as long as we check out by 11am they wouldn't penalize us. And hotels.com would refund us for the rest of the stay. So we checked out by 10am. But of course I looked at the bill later and Comfort had charged me for the room which was already paid for through hotels.com I was not shocked....horrible experience from beginning to end. I haven't even called yet to let them know they screwed up my bill, I STILL have to calm down and it's been 5 days. I would never stay again. Oh, and it was the smallest suite I've ever seen. My advice....if you're going to Disney, spring for a Disney resort. Oh yeah, and they charge a resort fee!!!! This was by far no resort. Oh and the housekeeping wasn't anything special.

As a previous reviewer mentioned the lifts are extremely slow and one broke down for 2 days so it was a nightmare! Their are no internal stairs and the ones near us take you out into the car park so it is not really an option to just take the stairs. Our room was absolutely fine. We had the 2 queen beds requested and the put up sofa for our teenager. We were on the 7th (top) floor and away from the lifts so it was fairly quite. The cleaners are wonderful and did a great job every day. The main problem with this hotel are the groups of teenagers allowed to stay there at any given time. One day there were six coaches in the carpark which was ridiculous. In the evenings they overtook the pool so if you wanted to go with your family for a swim it would not have been easy. Even in our room we could hear them nearly every evening. One day we complained that the pool was dirty and immediately the hotel sent someone to take samples. After a while it was discovered that the teenagers had stuffed loads of straws in the vents so the pump was not working. They did sort it out quickly but maybe if the teenagers were supervised this would not have occured. Breakfast fine apart from being overrun with teenagers.

This is the second time I have stayed hear. For the money this is a great hotel. The staff is very friendly, knowledgable and always accomadating. The pool area is very nice and has a bar that opens after 3pm. Their is also a kiddie pool and a hottub. The pool is open till 11pm. The room is larger than average and very clean. A small area includes a sink, microwave, mini fridge and multiple cabinets. The breakfast area is very large and nice/clean. The hotel was full but we always managed to get a seat. The breakfast includes 3 kinds of cereal(fruit loops, frosted flakes, Raisin Bran) different kinds of instant oatmeal, doghnuts, muffins, cinnamon rolls, toast(white & whole Wheat), english muffins(plain and Cinnamon raisin), bananas, oranges apples, juices, a varitey of yogurt, biscuits,regular and chocalate chip waffles that are prepared for you. On a daily basis the following items were served but changed regularly, French toast, scrambled eggs, egg mcmuffins, sausage patties, bacon, prepared oatmeal and boiled eggs. The area is right next to old town and a great minigolf place. Theiir are many restaurants in the area to include simple fast food to a little more upscale places. The hotel is situated that it is knid of secluded and from the traffilc and noise of route 192 and old town even though it is right next to it. Some people have complained about time share people but in the two time I have stayed hear I have never been approached, These people seem to have booths in the hotels lobby where they advertise ticket sales for the major theme parks. If you approach them for tcikets they will attempt to get you to look at a video while having a breafast offsite. I know this because my brother in law did it. These people are not aggresive and they will not bother you during your stay uinless you initiate the interest/contact. This hotel also includes a fitness room with a very versatile weight unit, 2 treadmills, one eliptical and a stationary bike. All worked and were in good condition. I used them and was able to see my kids in the pool from this area. My only complaint is that the bar was out of many items to make mixed drinks for much of my stay. Otherwise the hotel gives you two tickets which are buy one drink get one free at the bar. The drinks are also reasonable. A bottle of beer is $3.50, draft is 2.00, mixed drinks are 3.50 (Virgin) 5.50 Regular.

The front desk was extremely helpful and also kept a list of local eateries on a sheet with driving directions. Two Walmarts are within 3-5 miles east of the hotel and also offer tons of Disney stuff at a good price. We bought most of our stuff there and they were similarly priced to the Character Outlets at both locations (Buena Vista and Premium Outlets). The Breakfast hot items changed daily (sausage links or chopped bacon or chopped ham, scrambled eggs or hard boiled eggs). Biscuits and gravy looked to be a hot item that never changed. There are two types of waffles (normal or chocolate chipped) shaped as mickey mouse and they make the waffles for the guest so there is not slow down like the usual choice locations. Plenty of breads, cereals, etc like other reviews. Seating is tough after 7:45am to 9:45 am, so go early around opening and it's easy. The pool is heated, and the majority of the pool is in the 4 ft range so young kids have alot of play area that they can stand in. The jacuzzi is large and the pool bar is always opened it seemed. It doesn't get too crowded at the pools like some places so do not worry. Plenty of seats and chairs. They do have some timeshare folks in permanent booths at the front which I never visited even after recieving some welcome package there. I also timed my trips to Disney and Downtown Disney and none were more than 16 minutes with no traffic to speak of. Only thing to be aware of is the room doors are loud when they close on there own and you can hear your neighbors doors shut and outside hallway noise. Our first night it was a concerned since we stayed on the first floor. A friend of ours stayed on the second and had not noise to speak of but for us we kept our bathroom vent on and the bathroom door cracked for some white noise to drown any outside noise and it solved it.

I cannot say enough good things about this place, really. I priced over a dozen hotels and this one just came up tops. When I got there, we sacrificed nothing for the price. In fact, we got a lot of amenities that pricier places didn't offer for free. One thing to note: this hotel is on the opposite side of the Disney exit than the others. What this means is that you have NO TRAFFIC getting in or out of the park at any time. Trust me, you want to pay attention to this tidbit if you're driving in. Plus, the hotel is literally 5 minutes from the park. It's the best deal for the price, trust me! It's right next door to Old Town, which is kind of a dumpy-looking carnival place, but it's fun to go visit once... plus Fireworks are offered every Saturday, you can see it from the hotel.

No, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to a friend, HOWEVER, it depends on what you are looking for. I will explain below. Since October 2001, my family has visited Disney world 28 times (found this out from Disney records while trying to book a hotel), Universal Orlando 7 times, and Sea world 4 times. In all fairness, this was one of the worst hotel experiences we've had. Since we do a good bit of traveling to quite a few places and have stayed in $49.99 a night hotels as well as $300.00 a night hotels, that's a pretty strong statement. CONS 1) Customer service is pretty much non-existent and the night staff is openly rude (3 different night desk clerks and 1 night security guard) 2) First room air/heater broke within 30 minutes of arrival. Received second room, sofa bed was broken and would not pull out. Security guard was sent to assist but stated repeatedly he \"did not want to break a nail\"-no, I am not joking, that is a real quote and was said at least 5 or 6 times. We were told we would have to move to another room. When we asked if the sofa bed could just be swapped out or if we could use a roll away bed to keep from packing everything up again we were told \"No, you will have to move if you want the sofa bed. Third room, hair dryer and internet cable did not work. 3) Wireless internet is available only if you sit in the lobby which would be ok if the internet cable worked in the room, which it did not (in any of the rooms we had). 4) If you have ever been to Magic Kingdom on a Saturday--that is exactly what the breakfast bar is like, a stampede with all the associated pushing, walking in front of people, parents not watching their children as they stick their hands in the food and hit people as they go by. 5) At any given time, only one of the elevators is working which makes for VERY long wait times. If you stay here, stay on one of the lower floors so you can use the stairs, it is much quicker. 6) Pool bar offers 2 for 1 drinks so it gets a little rowdy at night and the elevators smell of beer. PROS 1) Great location. 2) The appearance is lovely inside and out. 3) The rooms (2 queen bed with pull out sofa) were fairly big with a good layout. 4) The breakfast bar had a great variety including Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes (I have to admit this was selling point when we booked the room and the girls loved it), sausage links, ham, assorted muffins, doughnuts, fruit, cereals, breads, yogurts, and applesauce. 5) Nice little arcade for the kids. OVERALL You can get much more bang for your buck and much better treatment elsewhere. My 11 year old always nicknames the hotels we stay at like \"The Color Hotel\", \"The Lobster Hotel\", \"Our Favorite Hotel\", \"The Train Hotel\", etc. she has dubbed this hotel \"The Mean Hotel\". That pretty much says it all.

My boyfriend and I went to Trip Advisor and read the reviews for many hotels. Most were positive for this hotel. Because of that, and its close proximity to Disney (less than ten minutes), we went ahead and booked it. The hotel itself was great. We were on the 5th floor, facing the parking lot, and away from the pool noise. Our room was cared for every day, with new towels, soaps and TP. The hot breakfast evey morning was fantastic. If I could 'nit pick,' I would just say that I would have liked bacon with my eggs, and also cheese as a mix in for my eggs. But the biscuits and gravy were excellent. Throw in fresh hot coffee and waffles, and our bellies were good to go while we were at Disney. The hotel was just a bit off of the main drag, set behind, \"Old Town,\" a small district of restaurants, shops, and carnival style rides. It kind of reminded me of Gatlinburg, TN.There were putt-putt courses (one inside-black lit, one outside), two different go-cart courses, a Bungee catapult, as well as many other carnival rides. My boyfriend and I felt like two teen-agers at a carnival. All of this was within walking distance from the hotel. It was a nice little spot to unwind the first night of our trip, before going to the parks the next day. There were several sports teams at the hotel at the same time, so there were plenty of kids around. We didn't hang out in the common areas too much, though. The halls were relatively quiet. I would say that the front desk was a little under-staffed for the size of the hotel. They will help you with anything, but be prepared for a wait. Also, I would caution anyone about the \"consierge.\" They were friendly enough, but they are a separate entity, who will ask you to visit a time share property in exchange for their services. They did help us with directions on the last day, however. If you haven't booked your activities, you may want to look in on them, to see what they're offering. Otherwise, I'd ask the front desk, or make some phone calls. If you are looking to take a shuttle to Disney, it is a little inconvenient. They pick up at 7:30am and 10:30 am. One was a little early for us, and one was too late. We ended up taking the rental car to the parks. It cost us $11 each day, but one parking pass is good for the all of the parks.

We live in Florida and have been to Disney somewhere near 100 times--no kidding!!! We've had annual passes several times and are big disney fans. We've stayed in Disney Resorts, deluxe, moderate & value and many times off property as well. Sometimes we splurge and sometimes we economize. This Comfort Suites was a great find. It looks like it has been newly painted, and it is clean and comfortable. Lobby is small but pretty painted in blues and yellows. The 2 bed suite we stayed in had very comfortable beds and soft pillows. Room is long and wide. Furniture could use some updating but very presentable room with new bedding. The bathroom looked newly done, air vents were white and clean. Small kitchen sink, small fridge and coffee maker are convenient. It is one short block (1/8 mile walk) to Old Town which is a fun place to go to if you have extra time. Although we didn't use the pools they looked inviting with plenty of trees and landscape around them. The breakfast buffet was adequate although the scrambled eggs tasted a bit synthetic, but it's enough to get you out the door. AAA price of $62.99 for this weekend.

Towels were made into various different shapes much to our childrens delight; on returning from the parks each day they would go straight into the bathrooms to see what the maids had made. The breakfast was an added bonus and saved us quite alot of money over the course of our two week stay, there was always something that we found to our liking. There were no problems with reception, we only had the need to speak to them on three occasions, once to check in, once to check out and once to ask if we could keep our room on for an extra two and a half hours prior to checking out; the girl on reception had a quick check at the availability and said that it would not be a problem and there would be no charge. Lots of people on here mention the lifts, I can honestly say that we did not have a problem with these and never had to wait more than a couple of minutes, we were on the 7th floor. We were also at this hotel over the labor day weekend when the hotel was fully booked and although very busy there were no problems for us. it may be that the hotel has listened to the feedback and it has done something about the problem. The pool area was clean and tidy and the pool a nice temperature, we never went in the hot tub as it was on the very warm side, \"prefer getting in a hot tub when the outside temperature is nice and cold\". The poolside bar is good and offers fast food such fries, hot dogs pizza etc. the staff are friendly and you can pay cash or charge to your room, this may only be available if your staying at the hotel for a few days or more? One would of warning, if you're going to sit at the poolside bar in the evening, make sure that you cover up or spray plenty of insect repellant over the uncovered parts.....if you don't the mozzi's will have a feast!

The breakfast was excellent and although fairly basic, was certainly more than adequate to set you up for the rest of the day - as well as cereals, there was a selection of cooked food, as well as pastries, waffles, fresh fruit and yoghurt. There was a choice of fruit juice and tea and coffee on tap all day. The much maligned lifts were certainly not as bad as people have made out in their reviews, and we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes, and even this was only occasionally, and I would not consider this to be unreasonable. We were never approached by the people on the concierge desk and as far as I could tell they were not putting the hard sell on anyone - I was asked once whether I wished to complete an on line questionnaire when I got home, but when I declined it was accepted with good grace. The pool area was also clean and tidy, and the provision of clean towels at the poolside was a definite plus. I also made use of the fitness room, which was also excellent. The hotel is perfectly placed for visiting all the local attractions - Disney is only a 10 minute drive away, and the I4 is less than 5 minutes away which gave easy access to the likes of Sea World and to Kennedy Space Centre.

Waffles were the highlight of the morning-especially the chocolate chip mickey mouse waffles. Not much fresh cut up fruit either.

We requested the top floor upon contacting the hotel and our request was honored - upon checking in, the friendly associate handed me a key to \"the penthouse.\" The hotel was great and our maid service was exceptional! There were 5 of us, 3 children, and each day we returned to the kids stuffed animals arranged on the beds in various ways - they absolutely loved seeing what had changed every evening! They also enjoyed the fun ways the towels were folded - birds, flowers ,etc. Very nice touches!! Yes, the elevators are slow, but you have to take into account the quality of the other occupants. Children would \"hold\" the elevators to wait for their friends and such. We also encountered teenagers who hopped in and out of the elevators, stopping on every floor, just to be ridiculous. It isn't the fault of the hotel that their guests have never been taught any manners. The beds here are plush and comfortable, and each queen bed had four very squeezable down pillows. The five of us had plenty of room in the 2-queen suite. The refrigerator was perfect for a lot of water bottles, and the extra sink did come in handy. The breakfast is quite good, and with great quantities, but again, you have to contend with the rude patrons that can't seem to be avoided. A line forms for the Mickey Mouse waffles, and yet still some guests feel they can cut into the front of the line and help themselves to the waffles as they are placed into the tray, further delaying the line. The girls working there put out waffles as fast as the irons would allow. The hot foods varied a bit, but were mainly scrambled eggs with ham or bacon stir-ins (sausage once) and biscuits and gravy. There was plenty to eat and drink, including that fabulous real Florida orange juice, and nobody in my family had a single complaint about the food. If you're smart, get there at 7, though, as the later crowd gets a bit nuts. We never dealt with the \"Concierge\" due to the warnings I read on this site, so I can't say much about them, but the regular staff was friendly and helpful. The room was cool and comfortable, and we had no problems. It's a straight shot down 192 to Disney, or hop I-4 to go to Sea World or Universal. The theme parks are close, but the cost is affordable. Old Town traffic is a bit annoying, but it isn't too bad. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're visiting Orlando.

The location was OK, but not fantastic, even though there were several eat-in restaurants/take away restaurants, and flea markets within walking distance, the main tourist attraction area located on International Drive was not within walking distance and this made it difficult to get there each day. The taxis were expensive, and on some days we took the free shuttle which the hotel offered to Seaworld and then caught a trolley/bus from there to International Drive, this was a lengthy process and some days we would have to change 3 buses to get where we wanted to because taking a taxi was too expensive. There were a couple of other things we did not like about the hotel staff, one was that when we asked them to call us a taxi they would call one of their friends/associates who worked for a supposed private taxi company and would turn up in an unmarked car (no taxi signs/writing on the car) this did not make us feel very safe. The second thing was that the staff offered us discounted theme park tickets which when we had looked into a little more had a catch to them, we had to go to a \"free breakfast\" run by a different hotel company and then to a one- on -one talk and tour about time- share properties that this hotel were trying to sell you - they said it would only take 90 minutes but ended up taking half a day.

I say the hotel is close but it's not that close you experience any noise. Anyway, as for the hotel - check in was o.k., front desk staff not over friendly or helpful at any point but that is such a small niggle. The hotel was extremely clean (cleaning was taking place every day at some point). The pool area was fantastic with good size pool at perfect temperature, kiddie fenced in pool with water fountain, hot tub set amongst shrubbery. Poolside bar served drinks and snacks so could sit around pool and enjoy some good nights while kids played in 24 hour pool. Our cases were taken to our room by concierge staff who would not accept a tip, went out of their way to be pleasant each time we passed by and made the whole stay a really friendly pleasant exerpience, not annoyance at all from them. There are two lifts which you can some time wait for but so what, it's never really that long and by the time you've finished talking about your day in the park they have arrived. Breakfast, was possibly the only thing I wasn't over impressed with, it comprised of boiled eggs, fresh cooked waffles, yoghurts, toast, some fresh fruit but not a great deal of choice. It was nothing to complain about but not great either - it was always the same each day we were there too - oh and the seating could get difficult depending on time. The rooms were great size and kitchen area had microwave, fridge, sink. Not a great deal of storage space for family of 5 but we managed.

This was our first trip to Disneyworld and we were travelling with a 3.5 year old. The hotel is just off the main street and looked fine from the outside nothing unexpected or outstanding. The lobby is large and BRIGHT BLUE, YELLOW AND ORANGE...kind of made the place look more outdated but not a big deal. The staff wears tropical hawaiian shirts. The lobby contains a gift shop/ snack shop which is handy if you want snacks, camera stuff, pool toys, band aides ect. There is also a small arcade with an air hockey table, pin ball games, and driving games. There is Concierge desk (TIMESHARE DESK!!!) where you can buy Disney tickets...IF YOU GO LOOK AT A TIME SHARE. I just politely/ firmly told them no and that was that. There is also the eatting room which is a large room...I NEVER had/ saw a problem with people trying to find a spot for breakfast. The breakfast is fine! What do you normally eat for breakfast??? There is bread for toast, cereal, juice, yogurt cups, mickie waffles, sausages, eggs, so on! **THERE is ALWAYS HOT FREE COFFEE IN THIS ROOM** Also off the lobby is an exercise room with a treadmill, eliptical bike and other machines. The pool is off the lobby and is as WARM AS A BATHTUB!!! Even at night we went swimming!!! The hot pool is tucked behind some bushes and could be slightly warmer. There is a splash pool for toddlers but it is COLD. The pool was busy but not crazy. There is a bar but it is only open in the evenings...they make an excellent margarita. Our room was a suite with a King size bed and a sofa/bed. You walk into the suite and see the kitchen which is Large...no cutlery or plates. There is a microwave, minifridge, coffee maker. You then walk into the TV sofa area which on our side overlooked the parking lot and old town amusement park. (The palm trees came up to the windows which was nice to look at.) The main bed room was large and comfy. The bathroom had a Jaquzzi tub. Overall I was surprised how LARGE the bedroom was?! It was clean and comfy the linens where good and we had no problems!!! Area around the hotel : I was a bit scared of old town being that I am from Canada and didn't know what to expect. My husband went over to find some beer and came back and told me it was fine and fun. We went over near the end of our trip and I am glad we did...THERE ARE LOTS OF TOURISTS!!! There are some funky clothing stores (retro/vintage) and some karoke bars (Spelling.) We found one bar with a large dance floor where my 3.5 year old girl danced with a 4 year old boy while we had a margarita. (Harmless fun.) There is a red lobster, A&W, Ponderosa (Really yummy) about 5/7 minute walk past the parking lot. There is a small grocery store on the left hand side just before the main street beside a pizza hut (5 minute). Shuttle bus: The shuttle bus leaves 7:40, 9ish, 10ish and 11ish and goes to the MAGIC KINGDOM. The shuttle returns 5:45 for a 5.00 per person fee, or 7ish, 9:00 and 10:30. IF YOU WANT TO GO TO ANOTHER PARK YOU MUST GET ON A FREE DISNEY BUS TO GO TO THE OTHER PARKS. THE SHUTTLE BUS GOES TO THE OTHER COMFORT INN WEST THEN TO THE MAGIC KINGDOM (this takes 30/40 minutes). IF YOU ARE GOING TO ANIMAL KINGDOM IT TOOK US 1.5 Hours TO GET THERE. If you have small children some of them where getting tired/ bored. The hotel shuttle bus has movie screens and plays cartoons. TO GET TO DOWNTOWN DISNEY...you have to check a shuttle to the magic kingdom...then catch a bus to a disney hotel...then catch a bus from the hotel to downtown disney. Saratoga springs is the closest hotel to downtown disney and you can walk there in about 10 minutes. **Since the fireworks are at 8:30 or 9:00 we missed our 9:00 shuttle...right around the corner where the busses park is the I56 city bus which will take you right in front of old town for 2:00. The I55 bus will take you to the Magic Kingdom...not the nicest bus but its good to know its there if you are in a pinch. SO there you have it!!! There were lots of Canadians and locals staying at this hotel which makes sense because it is a bargain. IF I had the budget I would have stayed at a Disney resort, especially one on the monorail track. FORGET ABOUT PARK HOPPING IF YOU ARE BUSSING IT WITH LITTLE ONES!!! hahahahaha I don't know who/ how that would be possible?! Would I recommend this hotel?

The location is just off a main strip near \"Old Town\". Old Town seemed as an amusement a little run down in comparison to most of Orlando but at least was something to look at as we walked up to the main road that had some chain restaurants (we ate at a Pizza Hut). It wouldn't be a reason to stay here but it's not a detraction. Disney is a short drive from the hotel and I believe there may have even been a shuttle if required. The breakfast buffet was alright really. For the kids it had plenty of choice with Mickey-shaped waffles and cereal and they loved helping themselves. It's all not of a totally high end quality but really what do you want with a free buffet. There was a large selection when compared to a continental breakfast which is often offered with hotels. I think between the fruit, yogurt, cereals, coffee and hot stuff it's possible for anyone but the most picky eater to have a decent breakfast. Didn't get to the pool but it looked a reasonable size and not too busy when we were there. This is a reasonable place to stay if visiting Disney or Orlando attractions. I think the breakfast is good if you have kids and want to get some food in them before a busy day of amusements. In then end it's not a high end boutique hotel but that's not what it wants to be.

We chose this hotel based on 1.) Trip Advisor traveler reviews 2.) Cost 3.) Location and 4.) Amenities. Cleanliness And Staff: The one thing that stands out in this hotel is the cleanliness and the staff. The hotel is very clean (we only found one stray hair in the tub when we first arrived). Maid service came every day. They folded our towels in the shape of roses and rabbits. We returned to an immaculate room every evening. We were very surprised that the maid staff had even folded our pajamas and the blankets in our Toddler's crib! The towels are thicker than the towels you usually receive at this level of hotel. The sheets and blankets on the beds are very thin. However, after being worn out from the theme parks during the day, we were too exhausted to care about this in the evening. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful. They will accommodate you with whatever you need. Out son spilled a cup of ice water on one of the beds at 10:00pm. We called the front desk and within minutes they brought fresh, clean sheets to our room. We received our wake up calls at the proper time every morning. Our check in at the front desk was friendly and quick. Location And Views: The location is a very short drive to the 4 major Disney theme parks. This hotel does not sit directly on the main highway, but it is a stone's throw away from it. The area surrounding the hotel is an area with Pizza Huts, KFC's, Burger Kings, low budget souvenir shops, liquor/beer stores, tourist ticket/timeshare stores, etc. This hotel sits right on top of Old Town. We never made it there, but I know another reviewer called Old Town \"tacky\". Old Town is basically a \"street side carnival\" or \u201csmall town festival\u201d type of attraction with your typical carnival rides. Old Town was not an issue with us. The main issue was that our room was in the back of the hotel and did not overlook the lights of Old Town. A small comer of our room overlooked the hotel\u2019s pool. The main part of our room overlooked a torn up construction/dumpster area..not too pretty. We called down after arriving in our room and asked to have a room facing Old Town. The front desk said that there were not any vacant rooms facing Old Town and to try back in the morning. My Husband did not care about the view and did not want to pack again and change rooms, so we stayed in our original room. Amenities: Ok, the \"free\" breakfast is just not good. We have had other \"free deluxe breakfasts\u201d and they have been much better. The selection was plentiful, but to be completely honest, it was the quality that was not great. There were a lot of generic, pre-packaged foods. Mini muffins and mini donuts that we spit out after one bite, low quality white bread and flat English muffins for toasting, a couple of generic cold cereals in big plastic bins, boiled eggs floating in water, yogurt sitting in icy water (where it soaked the containers and made the yogurt runny). The breakfast room was also hot and extremely crowded. People let their children run crazy through there, bumping into you and cutting you off to get what they want from the bar. There is a sign asking parents to supervise children, but I did not see this happening. It was also so crowded, everytime I turned around someone was ramming or bumping into me. I felt like I had to fight crowds of people just to grab a piece of fruit. We did manage to grab fresh fruit (bananas, oranges, apples) from the breakfast bar and head down the street to Dunkin Donuts. At Dunkin Donuts we would order coffee, muffins, donuts, bagels, croissants and have our fresh fruit from the hotel with it each morning. Dunkin Donut's reduced fat blueberry muffins and coffee are phenomenal! Also, we did not have to fight through maddening crowds at Dunkin Donuts to get our food or sit at a table. The other bonus is that we did not have to worry about children or adults ramming into us with a full cup of coffee in our hands. We used the pool one night. It was heated and is open 24 hours a day. We never used the kiddy pool, because we never saw the fountain on during our stay and the water looked kind of stagnant on the bottom. The cleanliness of the pools was average. I did see a greasy film on the top of Jacuzzi. These pools do get a tremendous amount of use. Day or night, anytime we looked out, there were tons of people swimming in the pools. People also like to sit around the pool and drink alcohol, because there is a bar right beside the pool. People also smoked around the pool, because the inside of the hotel is completely non - smoking. The Internet service in the business center you have to pay for. It is $1.00 for every four minutes -ouch! Also, there is no printer. I chose not to go online at all to check my email (even for business) at those prices. The front desk clerk also warned me that the internet service was extremely slow. We never used the restaurant on site, but did order several times from \"Flipper's Pizza\", a place recommended by the hotel. Flipper's Pizza delivers right to your room and the pizza is always hot, fresh and delicious. You will receive flyers from other pizza places slipped underneath your door. There is a note in your room warning you to not order from these establishments. Apparently, they are \u201cfly by night\u201d places and the quality is terrible. We even received a flyer from a pizza place saying that if their phone # was blocked, use your cell phone or a pay phone to order from them. It seems the hotel has blocked the rooms from even calling these establishments, due to the poor quality and complaints. The front desk said these people are also trespassing on the property, when they put these flyers under your door. This does make you wish there was some kind of secured entrance to this hotel. There was a laundry room on our floor (7). It was very clean, but it only had one washer and one dryer, which someone was always was occupying. We just saved our washing for when we returned home. Price And Overall Value: We booked this hotel using the Orlando Magic Card, which anyone can get for free by downloading it from the website. The rate per night, before taxes and fees was $79.00. It was an OK value, I guess. I feel that it would have been a better value if the breakfast was of higher quality, the internet access was complimentary, the kiddy pool was usable, the view from the room a little easier on the eyes and their were larger clothes washing/drying facilities available. Next time we come to Orlando, we may try a different property just to compare. I really wanted to \u201clove\u201d this hotel and return again and again, but we probably will not return unless we can get a room for around $50.00 - $60.00 per night. $80.00 a night, plus resort fee and taxes in February is a little steep for us, (budget travelers) in my opinion. I found some other hotels without business centers, free breakfast, kiddy pools, etc, that we could have booked for around $50.00 - $60.00 per night.

This was the second time we had stayed here, the first being a few (3?) years ago when it first opened and in general the quality has gone down while the price has doubled. The things that are still good about this hotel are the rooms, which are very big for this class of hotel, and the housekeeping, who always did an excellent job cleaning the rooms. The pool was well heated, beautifully warm and is large enough to never feel crowded. Now for the things that were not so good. Thje elevators are extremely slow, there are only 2 of them, and it is not possible to use stairs as they do not connect from the inside of the hotel (i.e. they are emergency exit stairs only). With the hotel booked to capacity, we often had to wait long periods for the elevator to arrive and there to be sufficiant room for us to get in. The free breakfast works well when the hotel is not full, but when at full capacity it cannot cope. There was often no table available, the noise level was high, and the lines to get food were annoying. The setup was also less than ideal, with 4 waffle makers positioned in the middle of the breakfast bar, causing long lines to build up waiting for waffles to be cooked. People lined up behind not realizing that others were only waiting for waffles. In general it was a very confusing, unrelaxing start to the day. Other annoyances were the constant \"carribean style\" music being played around the pool, too loud to be ignored, and the hotel in general is now in need of some touch-ups and updating. In summary this is still a reasonable hotel, but (at the time we booked) was more expensive than other equivalent hotels in its class, and it struggles to cope when it is full.

The front desk personnel were all nice, however, I did have difficulty understanding a couple of them because of their broken English and they had difficulty understanding me as well. My only other complaint is that there are only 2 elevators and the word 'slow' does not even start to describe the turtle pace at which they move. Use the stairs if at all possible.

Also coffee, milk, tea, and an array of juices. It was crowed during breakfast time, but the eating area is large and there were plenty of tables to accomodate everyone in the dining area. I would like to WARN everyone NOT to order from the flyers that are placed under the doors to the guest rooms. There are multiple flyers that are placed there daily and the deals for pizza, spaghetti, etc seem too good to pass up... but trust me.... pass it up. Although the hotel advised me not to order from any of these people (they said they can't control the people walking into the hotel and going from room to room putting them under the doors), I did so anyway and it was a huge mistake. We got pizza and spaghetti and garlic bread from this one place that delivered. The pizza was horrible... as tough as leather... nasty is the only word that comes to mind for the so-called sauce. I absolutely hate spaghettios from the can, but frankly, spaghettios are 100 times better than the spaghetti that was delivered to us. And as for the \"garlic bread\" that came with out mean... it was toasted hamburger buns (plain... not even a bit of butter or garlic on them). The whole meal was a joke.

It took 5 minutes to reach the main gate of disneyworld (another 5-10 from there to actually get to the parks) and about 20 minutes to get to Universal Studios. The hotel does offer a free shuttle service, but we rented a car instead because the shuttle service was limited to mostly Disney stops. For example, the shuttle only made one morning and one evening stop at Universal parks, and the evening stop was before the parks closed. We booked our trip through Expedia (flight and hotel together) and when we arrived we had to pay a daily resort fee of about $2.50.

We have been to Florida for 6 years and have stayed in numerous hotels but this was by far our favourite. The hotel is situated right next to Old Town which has plenty of shops, bars, small fairground, car shows and bike shows and a great atmosphere. Check in - I had been pre-warned about the concierge staff trying to take your cases and mither you but they were a big part of this hotel's welcoming feeling. We were greeted at reception (would have to agree that the staff here aren't that friendly or helpful but hey you don't have that much to do with them anyway) and then handed over to Buck our concierge who took our party of 12's luggage to our room and would not accept a tip, all of the concierge staff greeted us by name each time we passed through the lobby and were always friendly without trying to sell us a thing! We also went for our welcome pack and free gift from the concierge desk which had money off vouchers for local attractions and a beautiful cake wrapped in gold ribbons and at NO point were we pressued into doing anything! The hotel itself FAB FAB FAB... The whole hotel was very clean. The rooms were great, good size, excellent air con, microwave, fridge, large bathroom with great shower. The rooms was cleaned daily with fresh towels and complimentary toiletries. We were on the 5th floor and had a fabulous view over old town (my only niggle was that there wasn't a lot of storage space for a family of 5). The breakfast buffet was nice, with fresh waffles, muffins and bread for toasting, boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy (I think the americans call them)? Yoghurts, cereal, fruit juices. It does get a bit samey but you can nip to Ponderosa for breakfast or McDonalds or even do as we did and buy in from the local supermarket Publix. It can get very busy too but there is always a table, it's not a problem. Again, the only niggle I would have with the breakfast is that the toasters are really slow and didn't always work which caused long ques and put you off even trying. Pool was always clean and just the right temperature, good sized. The hot tub was set back from the pool surrounded by shrubbery - very nice. Plenty of sunbeds, tables and umbrella's. Poolside bar offered a good range of drinks and snacks (although I agree that it was a bit of a pain it not opening until 3pm, as kids often wanted soft drinks before then). The lifts! - what is the problem? - the lift was more often that not called for us by one of the concierge people and we never waited for any longer than a minute which is no time at all when you chatting to each other about all the fabulous things you've done that day. The only time we found them slow was when an ADULT! had pressed the button to every floor before getting out! There is no noise from Old Town but I belive from people travelling with us that the rooms overlooking the pool can get noisy from kids playing in the pool, as it is open 24 hours, but again your on holiday, who cares? The complimentary shuttle bus to the parks was great - always on time. I could keep going but all in all i've never been so sad at having to come home before then when I stayed here, it was just a great stay from beginning to end and we are definately going back again next year - why change a good thing?

To be honest, it didn't really live up to my expectations. The photos on the internet were deceiving - the lobby is nowhere as beautiful as in the photos, and the pool is smaller. However, the rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. The maids did a great job and fold the towels into fan/seashell shapes. My three kids aged 11, 10 and 7 even liked the sofa bed and told me is was very comfy. I liked having a suite, but I wished the sink/micrwave area had plastic forks, knives and spoons. That would have been handy for in-room meals. I do have to say that I was impressed with the service we received from the bellboy upon checkin. He insisted on taking our luggage up to our room on a cart even after my husband refused. He was extremely polite and helpful in unloading our bags for us, and he refused the tip my husband offered him. We really appreciated that - a very kind gesture you don't see too often. I also admit that this hotel is very ideally located to the Disney parks, Univesal and Sea World. We didn't go to Disney but it's just a couple miles away. And it was only about a 15 minute drive to Universal. Even though the pool was smaller than I thought it would be, our kids absolutely loved it and spent a lot of time in there each night. The hot tub is small but served the purpose. We didn't eat at the pool bar/snack shop because we had our fill of junk and snack food at the amusement parks during the day. But from what I've heard the food is good. The breakfasts in the morning were great, although two of the mornings we could barely find a table. 8am seemed to be the really busy time for the line. We went at 9:30 another morning and the crowd was much more tolerable. The food was OK, nothing too fabulous but did the trick- the best item was definitely the homemade waffles with whipped cream. But they also offered hot and cold cereals, fruit, yogurt, donuts etc. There were plenty of choices to satisfy most. By the way, we found the elevators to be fine. They weren't slow. There was only one time during our whole stay when we took the stairs instead because we were tired of waiting. And that was after the hotel got very crowded on the weekend. Also I have to say that noise was not a problem for us. We heard a few voices running past our room at night - but not any worse than any other hotel. I should note that I had read about the timeshare sales pitches on TripAdvisor before we got to the hotel, so we avoided the ticket sales area like the plague, and we had no problems whatsoever. Being near Old Town is a plus for this hotel. We strolled over there one evening to check it out and it was fun to walk over there and look in the shops and get a bite to eat. My husband really loved the car show. He is a car buff so that was right up his alley. Also if you want to find a restaurant or store elsewhere, there is so much right near the hotel it's very convenient. Overall, it was a good price for this hotel and what it had to offer. It suited all our basic needs, but I guess I was expecting something a little extra from an award winner and I just wasn't feeling it.

We requested a late check-out (check-out is 11 am) and were cheerfully given an extension until 1 pm, at no additional charge. There were 6 of us in our room and we had plenty of room. If you are orgranized, sharing the bathroom will not be an issue. We had to be certain to ask for extra towels and this request was fulfilled. We had two queen beds and a pull-out couch. My two kids slept very weill on the pull-out and had no complaints. There are PLENTY of restaurants, major chains and all price ranges, up and down the main drag. They all tend to be open later, so you can grab a quick snack or meal after a late day at the parks. There is also a Walgreens (open 24 hours) and a Publix food store within walking distance. The rooms come with a small refrigerator and a microwave, so you can stock up on goodies at the two stores. Old Town is nearby and is a neat place to visit. The parties go late into the night, but you will not hear it at all. They have rides, shops and small restaurants and the atmosphere is like a big carnival.

The rooms are clean, has friendly staff, breakfast is provided and has a nice pool / hot tub with towels supplied. Check in and check out also went smoothly for us. Disney is about 10 to 15 mins by rental car depending on the park you are visiting. The main problems with the hotel are: * Concierge - see below * Lifts are very slow and packed in the morning leaving you waiting for the next lift so get a room as close to ground floor as possible so you can use stairs if need be. * Can be noisy at times due to the closeness of old Kissimmee and its few ride attractions. That said there is a Pirates Cove mini golf right next to the hotel. So just get a room on the back of the hotel and you will be fine. * You get a lot of flyers pushed under your door. Don't use any of them especially the Pizza ones. They have well known names but are normally fraudsters after your credit card details or the pizza was made in a garage somewhere. I would note that the breakfast is not full English but more than Continental and the same every day so if you do not like muffins, cinnamon rolls and waffles you may get fed up of toast and egg but it does save you a lot of money. However you do have to pay a resort charge of $2 a day that really covers the breakfast. Concierge -------------- Concierge or should I say TIMESHARE salesman. Yep they help you take your baggage to the room give you a gift of cookies and then add on can we have a 15 min chat to check how good our service is. What they forget to mention is really that is 5% of the conversation the rest is trying to sell you into TIMESHARE. Our saleman MOE was fine but he never actually checked back with us during the holiday till it was sales pitch time. This was extra annoying because my mother in law had to bare the brunt of it rather than myself as she booked the hotel but we arrived a day early and agreed for her to meet MOE. Had they been upfront I would have been happy to just do the review section and avoid the sales pitch. We had already got our park tickets so we did not use any of these Concierge services but I think I would advise you to avoid them especially now you know they have an ulterior motive behind providing the service. Note other reviews state they gave vouchers and were not actually cheaper than buying at the park itself. General area points worth noting: * When you come to the hotel from the airport on 417 Toll Road the exit ramp booths need 2 quarters (exact change) so make sure you have change there are no dollar bill holes or ways to contact people for help. * Access to highway 192 and route 4 is currently restricted at Junction 64a/b. This means: ------------>Coming and going to Disney is unaffected on 192 ------------>You can head I4 east from 192 when going to Universal but when coming back I4West has no access to so use Gaylord hotel exit 65 ------------>Similiarly heading I4East from 192 when going to Tampa is closed but not when returning home. So overall other than concierge this hotel is a good pick.

The room was very spacious and had a sofa sleeper and dining table. The internet worked every time we tried it. There were many lighting fixtures in the room so you can adjust the light to whatever level you choose. The breakfast buffet was really very elaborate. Donuts, cinnamon rolls, hot and cold cereal, biscuts and gravy, waffles, yogurt, muffins, juices, coffee, milk, mixed bananas and strawberries for your cereal or waffles, an assortment of teas, and more! Even though it is a large place with many guests there was always a place to sit. The dining area is nicely decorated. The pool was wonderful. It is so nicely landscaped and the pool is just the right temperature. I do not usually use the hotel pools but I could not resist this one. There was always enough seating around the pool.

The front desk tried to send us to the \"concierge\" for information. In fact, the \"concierge\" was an employee of another resort. They may have had information to share, but they wanted us to do the 90 minute tour of their resort first. The big pool was OUTSTANDING. Perfect temp, clean as could be. Same for the large hot tub. Prices at the cabana were very reasonable , two dollars for a bottle of Coke. The pool is open 24 hours which is perfect for the late nights after a full day at the park. The halls are brightly lit.

Rooms were cleaned and tidied extremely well, and the bathroom bits (shampoos, conditioners etc) were plentiful and replaced every day. The rooms had a little kitchen area with fridge, microwave and kettle, but no plates or cutlery, so if you're tempted to make yourself a snack, just remember that you will have to take spare plates/cutlery from the breakfast room. (they are all throw away anyway) We didn't use the gym or pool but they looked good.

This truly did become our home away from home during our vacation. It is nestled back in a little alcove between Old Town and Pirates Cove mini golf. Even with the night life at Old Town, our hotel room was very quiet. We walked to Old Town on several evenings and played mini golf four or five times. The hot tub was excellent after the many long days at the Disney parks and our boys stayed in the pool for hours on the days we had nothing planned. We ate the breakfast buffet every morning which was excellent and saved us a ton of money. We ate at the pool bar once and the food was above average for a pool bar, I think. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job, as others have already mentioned, with the cute shapes with the bath towels and arranging my sons' many stuffed animals (won at Old Town!) in different ways on the beds each day. Contrary to some other reviews, the front desk staff were very helpful, cheerful and always willing to offer help or a smile each morning. Yes the elevators were slow, but who cares? For the price I paid and the service I received, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Orlando. Did I mention it took us 5 minutes to get to any of the Disney parks each morning?

The free breakfast in the morning is just great. They have lots of variety including fruits, boiled eggs, and a coffee bar. You can make your own capuccino or latte if you want to! I didn't use the pool but the food my brother brought back sure tasted great! I lived on the fifth floor and it usually took about 2~3 minutes for the elevator to come up. I met lots of nice people here. The housekeeping staffs were exceptional! Not only was everything cleaned throughly, they even organized and folded towels and tissue paper into those pretty flower shapes. The front dest people were very friendly and helpful. When I mentioned I had to check out early due to an early morning flight, they slid in an express checkout form with the receipt and documents so all I had to do was to make a phone call to check out. The morning calls were all made promptly every morning. As for the shuttle service, well, there were two drivers so it kind of varied. One was always on time and he always came into the breakfast area to announce his leaving time before he went and reminded everyone the different pick up times and places. The other driver was quieter and was late on two occasions, but both were no later than 20 minutes. There were about 5 drop off times and 5 pick up times. 2 to Magic Kingdom and 1 to every other Disney parks. In case you miss one, you can always get on the hotel shuttle first then use the Diney shuttle to get to the park you want to go. It only takes about an extra half an hour. Comfort Suites share the shuttle service with two other hotels so it takes about 30 minutes to get to Disney, but since we were always the first to get on the bus everyone here always had a seat!

The reviews from this site were very good and I trusted that everyone was telling the truth. After staying there seven nights I would have to say that I made a great decision. The hotel is located right next to Old Town, but it is far enough away so you don't really hear the noise from there. It is also located right off Highway 192, but again it is far enough away from it that you don't hear any noise from the highway. It is very close to all the Disney properties and still fairly close to Universal and Sea World (About a 10 - 15 minute drive). If you are going to Internation Drive at all I would advise taking the back roads. They are not very crowded at all until you go past Sea World and it is much less stressful then having to use I-4 with every other tourist that doesn't know where they are going. I stayed in a room with 1 king sized bed and a sitting area. The room itself was just great. It was very roomy and came with everything one wants when staying in a hotel: A Small kitchen area (Microwave, Refridgerator, 2 cabinets and a small sink), High Speed Internet, Ironing Board and Iron, Hair Dryer, couch and coffee table. The bathroom is a very good size and ours even came with a removeable shower head (I'm not sure that all rooms have that). Over all the room was excellent and I would rate it a 5 out of 5. The housekeeping staff was also great. Our housekeeper, Ravza, was the best housekeeper I have ever had in a hotel. The first day we were there we put all of our tolietries on the counter. When we came back from the pool the next morning they were all organized on top of a towel and there was a cup lined with a washcloth with our toothbrushes in it. It was a wonderful surprise. Just a tip for other travelers, we tipped her about $2 dollars a day. I'm not sure this was why she did what she did, but It couldn't hurt. I would rate the housekeeping 6 out of 5 if I could :). The breakfast area is pretty good. They have doughnuts, bagels, bread, waffels and cereal every day. I can tell you though, i was sick of waffels by day 5. We always got down there between 7 and 8 and we never had a problem with finding a table. It seems to pick up later on though, so I would advise getting there early. The pool area is wonderful. We always arrived at the pool around 8:30 and left around 12 or 1. There were almost always chairs available the whole time we were there and the pool was not that crowded. The hot tub is huge and is very nice to relax in. It is set away from the pool and surrounded by bushes and trees. The pool was cleaned every morning and the tempurature was always very comfortable. The pool bar was also very nice, but I just wish it opened earlier. From what we could tell the pool always got very crowded later on in the day because of everyone coming back from the parks. We never used the shuttle, so I can't say much about that. We also didn't use the ticket booth in the lobby either. I would highly advise buying your tickets online before you come. There are not only cheaper then that booth, but you also get days free. For instance, I bought 2 tickets for Universal online from the Universal site and paid 120 or so. With each ticket I was able to go in and out of the park as much as I wanted for 5 days. You can't beat that. The ticket counter was not offering anything like that. Now we will go on to the front desk. We arrived at 11:30 am which was a bit early because check in is at 3:00 pm. I checked in and they said to come back in a few hours and they should have my room ready. I came back at 1:30 pm and it still was not ready. The lady at the counter was extremely rude and kept saying \"Welll, check in is at 3:00 pm, and it is not our responsibiliy to have to room ready early.\" I had just driven 20 hours from Miwaukee and was so tired I almost jumped over the counter at the woman, but I didn't. I came back at 3:00 pm and our room was ready. Thourghout the week I had to complain about a few noisey kids in the hallway and they seemed to respond in a reasonable amount of time, but that first experience left a real sour taste in my mouth. The only other thing in the hotel is the small game room where my partner Kendall and I played a few games of air hockey. It seemed to have some up to date games, but I never saw a whole lot of people in there. Overall the hotel was just great and I plan on staying there again next year.

Yeah, the elevators are a little slow... but big deal! (We used the stairs most of the time, since we were on the 2nd floor.) We had no problem grabbing a luggage cart, and an elevator, when we first arrived (on a Monday night). We stayed four nights total, and everything was great. My husband was happy because he was able to get a good internet connection (wireless and ethernet), and was able to check in with work on his laptop. The $2.25 (I think that's what the charge is per day) covers internet and safe, so you might as well use them! The shuttle to Disney has a set schedule, and if you miss it (this includes delivery back to the hotel), you're SOL. So, we opted to drive and pay the $9/day that Disney charges for parking; this gave us more flexibility anyways. The pool was warm enough for us (hey, we're from Michigan... we label 60 degrees as a heat wave!). The days were hot (80 to 85 degrees.. we miss it already), but nights get pretty chilly. The hotel has a gift shop (we were able to purchase some batteries for my son's toy phone), and the front desk offered up a phillips head screw driver so that we could fix his toy.

We try to behave the same way at a hotel that we would at home (not being pigs and picking up after ourselves). The breakfast was sufficient... hey, it's free! The waffles were great! I think you'd be hard-pressed to find the same amenities (free shuttle, free breakfast w/ waffles, gift shop, game room, coin-operated laundry, ice machines, heated pool, etc. etc.) for the same price! Anyplace else, approx. $90 a night would get you a dive! (Having the fridge and microwave in the room was very handy too.)

Place is clean. Staff on the whole friendly and for the money the resort is above average. If you want to book I strongly recommend you use the credit card that you originally book with. I planned on using my husband's card on check in as I had just cancelled my card because I lost it at the airport. As most resorts require you to pay once you arrive I did not think it would be a problem whatever way I paid. Unfortunately, as they had tried to authorise my card in the morning before my arrival, as the card was cancelled and therefore could authorise it they decided I had cancelled my stay. They could not contact my because I was on an airplane, so, rather than wait until I arrived they instead gave my room away. The front desk dealt with it in a professional manner, and luckily there was a room avaliable, however, this was only because someone else had cancelled as the hotel was pretty full. So my advice is that if you do need to cancel your card at short notice, ring the comfort suites with a different card straight away to avoid them cancelling you and arriving to find you have no room. They must be the only hotel chain to do this.. I know if you are a no show they will authorise payment at most hotels but to authorise it before you get there is a first for me I have learned my lesson..", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, ID", "Title": "\u201c\"Customer Serivce\" is not their forte\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4737689", "Content": "We just returned from spending a few days in Orlando and then on to a cruise so we were there for only a short time. They have a banner in their lobby boasting \"Platinum Serivce Award\" winner. It must have been the housekeeping or bartender service that the award was based on because it certainly wasn't for their front desk personnel. They relunctantly assisted us when we were checking in, (they got our reservations wrong and they blamed it on Expedia and made us feel guilty about using them), made us feel like we were interrupting something significant when we wanted a wake up call, and it obviously was a great imposition to them when we watned to check out. The biggest problem was regarding the shuttles. The website states free shuttles to the parks. What they don't tell you is that it only runs twice a day to select parks. The first day the shuttle was early. There was no announcement that it was there and when we went out to wait for it 10 minutes before it was scheduled to arrive we learned that it had already been there and left. This resulted in a $20 cab fare to the Magic Kingdom. On the Second day, we were waiting for it much earlier. Unfortunately, it was running late. This happens and we were being understanding however, when it was over 35 minutes late, we went to the front desk to find out when it would be arriving. The lady at the front desk informed us \"It will be here and I'm tired of dealing with you!\" This was pretty much the tone we received for our entire stay. Their front desk/gift shop personnel (which are one and the same) do not really have an understanding that their job is first and foremost customer service. As an HR Manager, this would not have been tolerated where I work. This was not platinum, gold, silver or even tin service. It was just plain rude. Beyond that, however, the hotel was nice, the rooms were kept very clean, the variety of food for the continental breakfast was good, the bartender was exceptional, and the variety of food offered from the pool bar was a surprise - and very very good. There are no bellman so be prepared if you have a big family and need to haul in lots of stuff. If management did a little 're-orientation' with their front desk personnel, the overall rating for this hotel would be at \"Above Average\" when considering the price.

You won't be disappointed, unless you are expecting luxury without paying for it. We checked in very smoothly. We booked through an online agency, and paid in advance. We entered our room to find it very clean, and cool. It remained that way for the week. We would leave our room between 7 & 8 am, have breakfast, leave the hotel and return around 2 or 3 to find our room clean and cool. Our kids stuffed animals were arranged in a different way each day, which they loved! My only issue is that the bedding is like any other hotel chain I've stayed in. It's thin sheets, a valour blanket, and a bedspread. 6 pillows in the room, and the towels were as expected.. thin and bleeched white. However no complaints about cleanliness. I was impressed! Breakfast was the same thing all week. Having said that, it's included in the price of the hotel, so it was a great way to start our morning and get going. They have some tiny muffins, powdered donuts and cinnimon buns. There is bread and english muffins you can put in the toaster. They make waffles hot off the griddle, regular or chocolate! You can cover them in syrup, whipped cream & powdered sugar. They also have hard boiled eggs $ buiskets. Then, they have fresh fruit. I saw a big bowl of strawberries one day and peaches the next. Then they have 3 kinds of cereal, fruit loops, raison bran, and frosted flakes. Next, you can choose apple juice, orange juice, milk or ice water. They have blueberry or strawberry yoghurt, and regular & decaf coffee. You have to be able to find something you like there! There is more food than I'm describing and for a delux continental breakfast, you won't be disappointed. However you'll miss bacon or sausage by the end of your week. We ate there mostly around 7am, and it was easy to get breakfast and seat yourself. However a couple of times we went there around 8:30, and it was PACKED, the elevator was SLOW, and we could barely find a place to sit. Lesson learned. The only time I heard anybody complain about a slow elevator was at breakfast time around 8:30. I mean, come on, the place is jammed up with people trying to get some food in their belly, and they are grumpy having to wait for anything. The elevators are just fine. If you are expecting to press a button and have a door open right away, then forget it. You'll wait about 30 seconds. Big deal. I think the longest we waited in a week was about 3 minutes. The pool was great! The little mushroom pool was only up about a foot deep, and it was cool! My kids only got in that the first day. Then they got in the heated pool (which some days was warmer than the air at 75+) and they wouldn't get out! My 5 year old could stand up in the shallow end, but my 3 year old could only stand on the steps. However, the deep end is only 5'5\" or so, so parents will find it easy towing around toddlers who like the water. The hot tub was really nice and refreshing, some days were hotter than others, the temp. fluxuated. It sure was nice getting into the hot tub after a long day at Disney! The games room was a great distraction at the end of the day. A couple of games my 3 year old could play, but I saw teenagers in there as well. There are probably 5 or 6 archade games in there, and it's right off the lobby. I never used the Disney counter, although they did pitch us a time share. No. Thanks. We used the laundry, and it was a great feature to have on the same floor. 4 quarters for a wash, and 4 quarters for a dry... although it usually took 8! Ice machines and drink machines on each floor too. We just drove down to Walmart/Target and picked up a 24 pack of bottled water, then froze it in the in-room fridge freezer. Great feature! Just a driving tip for anyone going within the next 6 months or so.... off the #4 hwy, the exit for the 192 is closed down, so map it out how to get back to your hotel from the #4. A little confusing, but if you have advanced notice, you can plan around it. Red Lobster, McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Old Town are a really short walk away, less than 5 mintues. I didn't feel any safety concerns about walking. We really enjoyed the miniput! Our little guy got a hole in one, and they almost threw him party! We were there 3 times. The easy course was great for my 3 & 5 year olds, they loved it! There are tons of restaurants and shopping stores very close by, if you have a car. Just take a drive down the 192, and you'll find something you like. We would stay here again. Bottom line for us is, we got up, got breakfast and got out. We came back around 2 or 3 pm for a swim and re-charge, and left again until 7 or 8 pm. We didn't spend TONS of time in the room, but that's not what we came to Florida to do anyways.

The two younger kids shared one bed, my husband and I the other and our 13 year old slept on the sofa, but she did not unfold it to make it into a sofa bed. Other reports have said the elevators are slow, I wouldn't say \"slow\" but there are 7 floors and only 2 elevators so it was quite busy at times. The pool was heated, not terribly warm, but definitely heated. I never used the hot tub. I used the washers and dryers (one of each is located on each floor by the elevator). They cost $1.00 each per cycle. My best advice is don't try to dry heavy clothes, they take forever!! Apparently detergent is available in the gift shop but I bought my own at a nearby Target. The breakfast buffet was okay. We stuck to mini muffins and cinnamon rolls. They also had cereal, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, applesauce and more. To drink they had coffee, 2 percent milk, orange juice, apple juice, water and I'm not sure what else. Housekeeping was very good, our 4 year old got the stomach flu so they had a lot to deal with. It was odd though that the last Sunday we were there they hadn't come by 2pm and then on Monday they knocked on the door at 8:35 a.m. ?? Guess they were eager to get rid of all traces of us. I was only disappointed in one thing. They tout that they are within walking distance of Old Town, and indeed they are, but it is not a short walk and not one that I would take alone or just with my kids. We never went there. There is a Ponderosa, McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut and KFC all very close. We ordered room service from the bar twice, they closed at 10 or it would have been 3 times. I liked the grilled cheese, the kids liked the chicken nuggest, my husband liked the fish, my 4 year old did not like the pizza and neither my husband nor myself liked the hamburger at all.

Only complaint was that the elevators were a little slow. They have two but should have put in 3 when they built the hotel. Last year we spent 4-5 nights at the Swan and had a great time. However, we couldn't justify the price given that most of our time was spent in the parks.

As for my boyfriend and I, we are both 24 years old, and from NY. This hotel was geared more towards families with children, as far as decorations, amenities, etc... The pool/hot tub were open 24 hours, which was great! It was very quiet the whole time we were there, and yes, the elevators were HORRIBLE!! We were on the top floor, so we wasted a lot of time waiting for elevators! It was within 15 minutes driving distance to all the parks, and we even visited Medieval Times, which was right down the road! There is a Chili's, and various other restaurants within a few minutes drive. McDonald's is across the street, if you prefer that sort of thing. Old Towne was certainly not what I expected it to be, and therefore, we did not visit. (More like a carnival type thing)It was interesting though, if you have a room facing Old Towne, to watch the crazy people on the Bungee Swings. Overall, the hotel is not bad. Very good for the price! I only made it to breakfast twice, and everything was gone and/or cold! I would recommend this hotel for those going to both Universal and Disney, because it is right in the middle of both! The room was very clean, and housekeeping was great!! Plenty of extra towels, which were greatly needed becuse the tubs collect a lot of water around the edge!! The fridge and microwave were very clean as well.

The high points: 1. Our room was as advertised, large and with all suite amenities (fridge, microwave, etc.) Cleaning staff were very friendly and thorough enough, with one small exception (see below). 2. Price ... averaged $72 a day, well worth it for the quality and location (it's right off Irlo Bronson Highway - Route 192) and a short 5 minute trip to Disney. 3. Pool was great, ice and laundry were convenient, deluxe continental breakfast was great for park days, even had the classic \"biscuits & gravy\" on the buffet a couple of times. Really saved some $ by only eating breakfast out three times in 7 days. 4. Overall an excellent stay at this terrific hotel. Two minor negatives ... and they are very minor, but nonetheless irritating. 1. We were charged almost $9 for three uncompleted in-state long distance calls ... our party didn't answer and there was no answering machine pickup. 2. As I was setting up the room for our stay, I happened to plug in an electrical device behind one bedside table and found two small articles of clothing from a previous guest behind it. Not sure how long they'd been there, but it made me question how long it had been since the room had been given a deep cleaning. Daily service was fine, but I still wondered.

In car movies in mini bus and great drivers on disney coaches.You don't need to drive if you stay at this hotel. This is our second visit to Florida and we have never driven. Bad points 1. Old town is a little sleazy, especially when there at night with kids. 2. Eateries nearby tend to be fast food places i.e K.F.C, Mc Donalds, Pizza Hut, Ponderosa. Missed our favourite Golden Corral althought found one up near Universal Studios (was within walking distance as we didn't drive). 3.

When we did find a meeting in Downtown the horrible American rep refused to give us our free meal because we were late but was quick to take our money when we wanted to buy something from him.VIRGIN YOU WONT BE GETTING ANY COMMISSION OFF US NEXT YEAR. We will book trips on our own!! Also Virgin never contacted us regarding the Hurricane which hit. But then again the Hotel didn't give us much advice either. Perhaps they didn't think it was a big deal but it was the first one we encountered-it wasn't too bad.

Its lovely having someone chauffer you around-you are on holiday for Gods sake!!!.If you want to go shopping get a hotel shuttle to Seaworld which drops you off at the I-Ride trolley bus stop on the parking lot at Seaworld. You then have a choice of Premium outlet Shopping Mall (our favourite) take trolley bus heading south or Prime outlets -a little more spread out (take trolley bus north)? stop 11(ask driver) all stops have a map so it's easy to find what you want and it's only a dollar each for adults and kids ride free.

The beds were very comfortable, the room was quiet, and we had a view of the rides, lit up at night at Old Town. I would recommend going to Old Town in the day instead of at night. We walked through at night and didn't like it at all! If you have young children or are Christians like we are, you won't like all the drinking going on at night. People are walking around with mixed drinks and beer in their hands, even in the shops. The breakfast was very good and they had a good variety. They had cereals, donuts, muffins, hard-boiled eggs, juices, milk, and waffles which I loved, especially with their strawberry and banana topping. The pool was also very nice, which my 14 year old son enjoyed a lot. The hot tub was nice after the long day at the park! We took advantage of the FREE shuttle service. The bus doesn't leave until 9:20am for EPCOT, but after talking to the very nice lady (Gilda) at the Disney counter in our hotel, I found out we could take the Magic Kingdom bus at 7:55am and then take the monorail to EPCOT. This worked out great, because we arrived at EPCOT 9AM, just when they were opening. The shuttle was nice, because we didn't have to pay $9 in parking. We ate at the Biergarten Restaurant in Germany (World Showcase in Epcot), this was an all-u-can-eat buffet. Delicious! Only $15.99 for adults, $7.99 for children during the lunch ( 11am until 3:45pm), after which goes up $5 more per person for the same meal.

The elevators can be a little hectic and seem a little slow during busy times \u2013 mid-morning and after the parks close, but with just being on the 2nd floor we could use the stairs when it seemed to take a long time. The pool was nice but seemed cold to me. The children\u2019s pool/fountain was nice especially with it being fenced in but unbearably cold at the time we were there. The hot tub was very nice. There is a small bar, which serves drinks and pizza, appetizers and such. The 2-for-1 drink coupons in the room were a nice touch. I printed directions off to get from the airport to Comfort Suites.

Of course, nowhere is perfect as I've found, and the gripe with this hotel is the security - although the location is quite secure itself, there appears to be little or nothing to stop you from walking into the hotel, grabbing a free breakfast and using the pool all day without actually paying to stay (not that I tried that of course!).", "Date": "January 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cexcellent value!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3007759", "Content": "My family and I (5 of us) stayed at the comfort suites from Jan 4th-10th 2005.

I read reviews for days and finally decided that this was the one I wanted to stay at! I was not dissapointed by anything at the hotel. The room was very clean upon arrival and the maid did a wonderful job cleaning it daily. We enjoyed the time spent at the pool area (pool and hot-tub very clean) The bartenders at the Tiki Bar were very friendly as were the hotel staff (always greeted with a smile) The continental breakfast was very impressive---cereal,fresh fruit,yoghurt,apple sauce, waffles, boiled eggs,different breads for toasting, muffins, doughnuts ,juices,coffee & tea. A lot more choices than your usual standard continental breakfast offered at other hotels. We also enjoyed being so close to Old Town..a few minutes walk! Our children are adults 18-25 so they could enjoy the evenings taking in the sights/sounds of Old Town as my husband and I enjoyed some quiet time by the pool :o) I had read complaints about the slowness of the elevators---in the morning as everyone was heading to the parks it was slow but we found it fine the rest of the time. There are many good restaurants within walking distance! Ponderosa offers a good breakfast deal if you feel like bacon, eggs ect. $3.99 all you can eat buffet.

The Magic Kingdom, Downtown Disney and MGM are just up the street from the hotel and even Universal Studios (the farthest away) was just 7 or 8 minutes away.

I'd researched the heck out of this hotel, and after reading so many great reviews, decided to book it. We got a great off-season internet rate directly through the Comfort website of just 55/night, plus the taxes, which brought the nightly rate up to about 65/night. This hotel is immaculately clean and spacious. We were in a non-smoking suite with two queen beds, a sofa bed, and full bath with jacuzzi tub (I believe this room was a handicapped designation). The room was HUGE! Lots of space to spread out with our two kids (ages 5 & 7). The room has a little kitchennette area, complete with a medium size fridge, microwave, cupboards, and small sink. We neglected to bring a few dishes with us, which we regretted, since we were too tired to eat out one night and stopped off at a market to buy some microwavable food, but we made do. I liked the small sitting area with a sofa, lamp and coffee table. Since there is a small divider between this area and the beds, my husband and I could sit and read there after the kids went to bed, without the light disturbing them. Our room was just across from the elevators, so I'd anticipated a lot of noise, but I was only bothered one time by some late-night revelers whooping it up in the hallway. Speaking of the elevators, this is perhaps the only minor complaint I had about the property. There are just two of them, and they are VERY slow. However, it wasn't really a problem for us as we weren't on any tight time schedule. I can't say enough about how spotless our room was. Our housekeeper, Marisa, made us think we were in the wrong room every day when we returned, it was so tidy! She even arranged the kid's stuffed animals in a cute pose after she'd made the beds. Now the breakfast: it comes free in the room rate, and while it is called \"continental\", it is so much more than a few muffins, juice and coffee. The offerings included freshly cooked waffles, boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, all kinds of muffins and pastries, cold cereal, fruit, a variety of juices and milk, of course coffee and tea, packets of oatmeal and grits, bread and english muffins for toasting and more. A couple of times, my husband and I went down and brought some stuff up to the room, but the other times, all of us enjoyed the spacious breakfast room. It was fairly crowded, but not overly so at this time of year. The pool is nice and warm, and the hot tub not too hot. We were so busy, we only enjoyed the pool on the morning of our departure, so we didn't miss the fancier slides some of the more expensive properties offered. There is a fun \"raindrops\" kiddy pool (a fountain of water sprays out over the kiddy pool), but this area is not heated, and the day we swam was just barely warm, so my kids tried splashing around in it a bit, but then opted for the warm main pool. I liked the fact that the kiddy area is completely surrounded by a fence with a high latched gate so that parents with little kids can relax around the kiddy pool and not worry about their little one wandering out to the main pool -- a very thoughtful detail to help out parents. The hotel has no restaurant, other than the breakfast offered in the morning. But there are scads of restaurants just off the main drag outside the hotel's long drive. Free, scheduled shuttle service to the Disney parks is offered, but we opted to rent a car (I recommend L&M Car Rentals at the airport!) so we'd have more flexibility. It took us about 10 minutes from the hotel to Magic Kingdom, and the route is basic enough to just get on and follow the signs. We were right in Old Town Kissimmee, but didn't have time to look around on our short trip. We had Disney tickets in hand when we arrived, but if you don't, there is a ticket seller on property selling both Disney and Universal Studios tickets. This place is a tremendous value for the money and I'd recommend it to anyone.

The hotel is very adequate considering your rarely in the hotel until the evening hours upon returning from the parks. The rooms are updated,very clean, the beds comfortable and the bathrooms always loaded with fresh towels. The housekeeping does an excellent job! To avoid problems no matter where you stay at I would always recommend calling ahead to verify your reservation. This one phone call can prevent plenty of frustration later on. Overall our stay at comfort suites maingate east was quite enjoyable. I would also recommend renting a car considering a midsize car for 4 days at thrifty was only $113.00.Don't let them sell you the extra insurance!!! The breakfast at the hotel was not elaborate or fancy but was enough. For $60.00 per night the hotel was well worth the price. It was also only minutes from all the parks. When your leaving the parks at night the last thing you want to do is wait for the hotel shuttle bus with your sleeping children!!! For example the bus to and from universal is ran on an extremely limited basis.There will be nights when you stay late for extra shows which are worth the stay.

The location of the hotel is superb as its slighty of the 192 so not much noise issues but close enough for all the resturants, of which there are many -- chinese, red lobster, pizza hut, burger king, 24hr Mcdonalds and a 24hr Denny's diner all within walking distance (5 mins). There's also a funfair type amusement area and a mini golf place all within the same area.

The Comfort Suites have a \u2018shuttle\u2019 service to the theme parks but we hired a car for the whole 12 days and found visiting the Disney theme parks a quick and simple drive from the hotel. Universal is a bit further to go but only a few minutes drive up Interstate 4. We also took day trips to Clearwater and Daytona beaches. This is a good hotel (suites) to use as a \u2018base\u2019 and we felt \u2018unbelievable\u2019 value for money. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Kissimmee is a pleasant area to stay in and 192 has so many restaurants etc. If you are going to Orlando the Comfort suites has to be high on your list for choices to stay. High standard/great value. We enjoyed our holiday in Orlando and would stay here again.", "Date": "August 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "luvtogolfBarrie", "ReviewID": "UR2443793", "Content": "We did a lot of researching of hotels and discovered this one.

My only negative comment about this hotel is that the continental breakfast can get tiring. It is the samething everyday. Mostly muffins, cereal, toast and waffles. It would be nice to have more of a variety.

The only thing that we were discouraged by was the shuttle service; there were no afternoon shuttles going to or from the Disney parks and the shuttle rides were almost one hour long.

I traveled with 2 young children and without my husband. The location next to Old Towne was a good break from Mickey and friends. Service was excellent. The rooms were clean. Any type of restaurant one could desire was conveniently located in the vicinity. Driving to the theme parks was extremely easy. We also tried the complimentary shuttle. No real complaints in that department. Driving offers more flexibility. The girls loved the pool. The complimentary continental breakfast was a good start of the day. As mentioned in reviews by others, the waffles were a big hit with the kids. The guest laundry was a lifesaver.

But two hours to us actually showing up the hotel gave our room away. They admitted they gave the room away two hours to us arriving.

Yes, the elevators are a bit slow, but a good thing about being on the 6th or 7th floor is that you're sure to get a ride down every time! The pool was great, we got fast food and pizza from the pool bar; the food being really good, and the service friendly. There was minor difficulty on Sat. nights with the Old-Towne car show going on, but once we figured out to use the 2nd (main) entrance off 192, and not the first one, we were fine.

The king bed in the master suite is very comfortable and I'll admit that our first night was probably the \"best night's sleep\" I've ever had on vacation. The only negative comment I have regarding the room is the need for more bath towels. There was a w/d located outside the front door that we shared with our neighbors in the next unit. We met folks from Michigan that were staying in Phase I and they had a much larger 2 bedroom unit with w/d in room. Now that I know, I will request a Phase I unit in the future.

People who stay here tend to keep after their children, there were never any annoying kids in the pool. It is quiet, I only heard the people above us move around a couple of times, I never heard them talk or their TV. I only had one complaint, they need to buy a machine to clean the carpeting, there were a few small and big stains... The resort is located really good, between Disney World and International Drive. If you stay in Kissimmee (to save a few bucks instead of staying on International Drive, you also get a two bedroom apartment instead of just a hotel room for the same price) this is just great. You have a huge Walmart nearby, Target a few minutes away (by car) and lots of restaurants and gift shops and outlets really close. It is possible to walk about in the neighborhood. We arrived very late and the gate keeper helped us really fast with check in. Gate security were also very good and friendly. I think this is a timeshare resort but we were never asked to attend any sales tour/talk. Very nice! If I am interested I will ask, I do not like if they call and ask several times, so a big plus to their employees. Pools and hot tubes were very clean and warm.

The layout of the apartment is excellent as we went as two couples on a fisrt floor apartment towards the rear of the complex. There was adequate parking spaces and within the unit a good selection and of resonable quality of appliances. One good point is that the unit has its own washing machine and tumble drier unlike other resorts where a community room is often provided and you have to pay. The resort seems to be geared more for the older group of clients as there was limited childrens facilities which is not a problem of course as the resort is on the doorstep of Disney. The only downside is the tempting offer of free tickets to some attractions etc. it is okay if you want to waste a morning as you have to go down the road to yes a 'timeshare sales' pitch. I am okay with this personally as I do not want to buy anymore weeks , points etc. but to a not so savvy client the advice is to try and stay clear of any offers that are made they are on a reducing cost i.e. expensive first then special deals for you then a one-off that is not going to be available if you come back later.

I was incredibly impressed with the complex and our appartment was perfect. I would have preferred to have not been on the ground floor for the views, but as it happened, it worked out perfectly with four very large, very heavy suitcases to lug to the car at the end of the stay! The site was well organised and easy to navigate. Despite being very quite, the pool was the perfect place to chill out and relax. It was rather small, and I can see how this would be a complaint in the height of the season, however we very often had the pool area to ourselves! The jacuzzi at the pool and just behind our building was a stroke of genius - perfect for relaxing after a hectic day at the parks. Speaking of which, Kissimmee is a wonderful place to stay. The several times before that we have visited Florida, we've always played it safe and stayed on I-Drive, but from now on, i'm pretty sure Kissimmee will be the way forward. The distance to the Disney parks is nothing at all, and not even 10 minutes by car. Universal is a little further away, but still, very simple to get to. The security checking every car that enters the resort was comforting and always very friendly. One thing I will say - when you check in, take the opportunity to go and talk to the vacation planner accross from reception... You do have to go to a pretty hefty talk on buying time-share, but believe me - the offers and discounts they give you are WELL worth it. We managed to get $100 off admission to Seaworld!! All in all, I can't think of a bad point to this place. Nothing worth complaining about, anyway! The appartments were spacious and more than well enough equipped. The air conditioning system was fantastic and the advantage of having two (HUGE) bathrooms was brilliant in the mornings! It's 100% what we were looking for, everything it says on the tin.

We have stayed at many Marriott resorts in Orlando, Hilton Head, and Myrtle Beach. I rate them anywhere from 4-4.5 stars. This place is definitely not up to par to any of those, however its not all bad. Our room was on the 1st floor. First impression was that it was very dark not sure if it was because we were on 1st floor or not. No big deal, just turn all the lights on. Some parts of the rooms were a little worn and showed some age. Bathrooms were nice with a stand up shower and whirlpool tub in master and a tub/shower combo in other bathroom. Kitchen was nice and seemed stocked with about everything you would need to cook. There is a big table for dining for 6. Tv's were lacking. No flat screens and a 14\" in master. Again, no big deal, but a lot of little things do add up. The bed in master was king size and very comfortable. The bed in other bedroom was only a double which could be an issue if it is to be used by another couple instead of kids. There is a free washer and dryer outside the front door that is shared with other unit on the same floor. The pool areas were adequate if not exciting. Both pools ranged in depth from 3 to 6 ft and were heated. There was a hot tub in each pool area plus 2 others. There is a 1 rim basketball court and 4 shuffleboard courts. Also a small playground. There are grills, but surprisingly, they are all charcoal. The gym is pretty pitiful for a place of this size. A treadmill, step machine, and a universal weight machine in disrepair. One odd thing going on there is that the front desk is where you check in, but the rest of your requests go through someone else. Supposedly there is some kind of lawsuit in progress. Had 1 interaction with management and it did not go well. Upon check in we had 2 garbage bags and 2 packets of dishwasher detergent. Called on Wednesday to have more of each brought to unit and they said to stop by office and pick them up. They handed me 1 garbage bag and I had to ask for 2 additional so that I wouldn't have to comeback. They then said that the 2 dishwasher detergent packs were part of a welcome package and there is a 50 cent charge for any additional packets. I refused to pay it because we were required to put all dirty dishes in dishwasher and run a cycle to clean them upon departure. They gave me 1 packet free, but that says a lot about this place. Overall, if you can get this place for $79 a night as someone there said they did, it would be worth it. But, we exchanged our timeshare for this and it did not meet expectations. My guess is that anyone that rates this place 4 or 5 stars is either used to hotels or got it at a bargain price.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pensacola, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, no pets, a few issues, nice staff & location, good gym\u201d", "Author": "Catamariner", "ReviewID": "UR94643084", "Content": "We came here for convenient access to Universal Orlando with excellent comfort at a reasonable cost.

The place was quiet and if had been warmer (there was a cold snap a couple of weeks before Christmas), we would have enjoyed the screened balcony overlooking the landscaped communal area (all the balconies overlook such areas instead of overlooking the parking lots. Good planning!). The free washer and dryer behind the doors on the landing between the two units was quite welcome. The karaoke party was great fun, midweek. The gym was surprisingly well-appointed, with a universal-style machine with multiple stations, although the small bar and one of the leg curl pads was missing (the large lat pull bar was present); I reported this and they noted it, so it may be replaced by now. We had one small maintenance problem (the lock on the doors to the washer-dryer got stuck), and when we reported it during the day (not after hours), someone came out to fix it immediately. The only drawback (and for some people this will be huge) was that for the first two days, we had to deal with bugs. There were very small black beetles in the master BATHROOM (which was huge and has a lovely corner with a jacuzzi); they would show up on the floor from the shower across to the toilet when it was dark, and there was one actual normal-sized roach on the bathroom wall the second night, all of which which we swatted and disposed of. Scarier for the non-southerners, the second evening there was a palmetto bug in the entryway near the small bedroom (these look like the biggest roach in the world, but they are slow-moving and normally live outdoors, so they will think they are hidden when they are under an electric cord, even though they show out both sides -- easy to kill, in other words, and PBs are usually not a sign of \"infestation.\" None of these bugs was in the kitchen, which was clean. My guess is that the unit was untenanted for a week or two before we arrived and that spraying elsewhere in the building drove a pregnant roach into our area, so the tiny beetles were probably a recent hatch, and who knows, maybe that was \"mom\" on the wall. I do know there were no roach droppings in the undersink area or on any surface that was inspectable; yes, I checked all of the undersink areas and shelves after finding the bugs. The bed was clean and the linens were fresh, and as I mentioned, the kitchen also was clean and had no roach sign.

The sheets were so soft ( the thread count must have been 1,000 thread) and the beds were very comfortable. I felt very safe and security was always guarding the front gate.The washer and dryer was in a room right outside the front door to your room, which was great that you didn't have to hear them going. The best part was FREE WIFI in your room. It was fast and had no problems with it. LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this resort and will be back.

It sits between Irlo Branson Hwy and Vineland. We arrived a day later than our check-in date and were immediately given our room to check in. We had to go to guest services to obtain our \u201cparking pass\u201d and a welcome gift. No welcome gift, just a pitch to attend a timeshare presentation for Grand Beach. We declined. There is a lobby with an activities room and a couple of outside areas in which you could pick up free Wi-Fi. Grounds: The resort has about 130 units with 2 heated pools, 4 hot tubs, tennis courts, shuffle board, playground, and putting green. Landscape around the area is neat, clean, and well maintained. We only went to the pool near our building. The pool is decent size, not huge, but it was heated and very clean with adequate seating. There are some tables with umbrellas and I would say that would be it for shade; not a lot of shaded areas. There is a security guard on duty 24/7 that checks all cars coming in. They also will give out keys to your unit if arriving later than 8pm. We left this morning at 5:30am and we gave him our keys for check out. Unit: We stayed in unit 1214 which is the last building overlooking the tennis courts. This was a timeshare direct exchange for us, so we did not receive any housekeeping services. There are no elevators in the buildings, but luckily we were on the first floor. Each building in Phase IV has 4 units on each floor but appears to separate slightly into 2 and 2. There is a washer dryer outside between each of the 2 units on each side, which is free. The unit itself is fairly large and has 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths, dining area, full kitchen, living room, and screened lanai. The kitchen has granite counters, full stove, fridge, and all appliances. The starter pack consists of 2 coffee packets, 2 tea bags, a small bottle of dish detergent, and 2 packets for the dishwasher and a box of clothing detergent. If anymore is needed, you can buy them for $.50 at the front desk. There are full salt and pepper shakers, paper towel and full service for 6-8 people. This kitchen has everything needed; nice set of pots and pans, including 3 nice fry pans. Sharp knives!! Very nice! The d\u00e9cor is nice with warms brown tones in the main living area and blues in the bedrooms. The carpet really needs to be replaced though as it is spotted and worn. Master bedroom has a Jacuzzi in the bathroom with a separate shower, chaise lounge which is great for reading and a comfortable bed. There is plenty of storage in both bedrooms for clothing. The second bedroom has twin beds with tub and shower. Both bedrooms have a 19\u201d television in the rooms and the living room has a 25\u201d. The living room consists of a sofa bed and 2 decent sized chairs with a cabinet which houses the TV and DVD/VHS player and also has drawers for storage. It appears use of the sofa bed would be tight to get around if opened. The dining area had adequate seating for six, as well as a breakfast bar which has seating for 3. You could purchase Wi-Fi in the room for 39.95 for 7 days, 21.95 for 3 days or 7.95 daily. However, if you choose to take your laptop to the area in back of the clubhouse, you could get it for free. No mid-week cleaning, towel exchange is done on Wednesdays if you put your dirty towels outside in the laundry basket by 9am. No charge for some local calls, but others with a prefix other than 396 or 397 were considered long distance and the charges for those are $1/first minute, .25/each add\u2019t minute Activities: A complimentary newspaper is delivered every morning, board games can be checked out at the desk and a variety of books are available in the game room. There are also various sports equipment, such as basketballs, horseshoes, and such also available at the front desk. There are various tickets to all attractions available at guest services at a small discount. As far as activities for children, they took those out of our packet since we were not traveling with any kids; so I can\u2019t comment on those. Overall: I would definitely come back to this resort; it is not too big and centrally located to everything. Disney is about 10 minutes away, SeaWorld about 15 minutes away. It is very close to restaurants. The only thing I did not care for was that the unit was kind of dark. It may have been the location of the unit, or the screened lanai, but the living room and kitchen were quite dark. The bedrooms were okay with adequate daylight, it was just the main area that was dark. There was however, great artificial lighting in the units. The other thing was there was a terrible odor in the unit. I bought some Glade candles which worked well, but I didn\u2019t realize they have an ozone machine which would have dealt with the odor.

No one http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/05/89/e0/kitchen.jpg http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/05/89/e0/kitchen.jpggets in without a parking pass or guest name and info. The location is great for all attractions. We had gone to Sea World, Universal, Islands of Adventure, and Epcot and it was all within 15 minutes or so. The whole resort is very quiet, despite the herd or elephants above us for about 4 nights of our stay. I think their rooms are adequately sound proof, but these people were just jumping up and down, running across.. we tried and tried to figure out what on Earth they could be doing.. so I do not believe it is an issue with the room.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cTheywere mean to there workers!\u201d", "Author": "megaldon", "ReviewID": "UR8360159", "Content": "I checked in everything was smooth front desk helped me with majority of my ?'s.my room was not clean and they actually gave me guff about it specially some guy named anthony he was a real jerk! and he was yelling and cursing at his workers in front of me i told him i could wait and there was no need to react that way but he kept on.

When we arrived at the resort at 3:30 pm. their was no rooms clean for us to check into. I had to leave my cell phone number at the front desk to call when a room was completely cleaned and ready for us. Ten minutes later I received a call that our room was ready. The room was okay but they said we would have a jaccuzzi but we didn't. Their are two pools and 4 spa tubs, the pools are quite small but the kids loved to swim in them. The spa tubs were so hot the water was unbearable. We had to just chalk it up and make the best of our stay. The ladies at the front desk were very courteous and helpful at all times. This is a timeshare resort, not one that I own but one that I was touring. It has no stores on the premises and no activities for adults. No swim up bar or nothing of the sort on the grounds. Activities are scheduled throughtout the day for the children for a nominal fee. Most places include this with your stay as you have already paid to stay and play. We had a good time but I do not recommend this place and will not be going back.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Diamond Polynesian Isles", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d88560-Reviews-Diamond_Polynesian_Isles-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$87 - $225*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3045 Polynesian Isles Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34746</span></span> (Formerly Sunterra Polynesian Isles)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "88560", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/13/40/1340d8d8f35f0e9516324eea288a02b084large.jpg"}}

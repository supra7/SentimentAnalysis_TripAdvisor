The tiny street is dotted with some amazing no cover jazz clubs that are truly unbelievable!! Now the hotel....very charming! Old, yes, but that is one of the reasons you come to New Orleans in my opinion. The room was well appointed and clean. There is a beautiful courtyard with a pool and a hot tub and a roof top deck. Ok....I saved the best for last....THE STAFF!!!!!!!!!! We were just there during Hurricane Isaac, yes Hurricane Isaac! Right before the storm started one of the staff members (cant remember names darn it) told us he was concerned about one of the windows in our room, so he moved us to a beautiful suite...Nice. When the storm hit naturally the hotel, along with most of New Orleans, lost power. Now, while this is totally out of their control, it is a bummer, because New Orleans is very hot and humid in August. What the staff did during this time was above and beyond anything I have ever experienced. First of all, they had the fire station across the street make coffee for us every morning. Next they had stocked up on food, water, and supplies for their guests. They even provided a barbecue for us including hurricane drinks the night of the big event. And, drum roll please, when we checked out 3 days later than our originally scheduled departure we found out they had comp'd us the 3 additional days!!!!!! They had been running around ragged to try to please us during a hurricane, and still they charged us nothing for our additional stay. Kudos to the entire staff at The Frenchman Hotel...We will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When we arrived in the city our tedious search for a reasonable and clean hotel began. Since we were traveling with 3 young children many of the major hotel chains wanted to charge us for a suite averaging $180 or higher. If we found a hotel with decent reviews that was affordable, they were booked. The Frenchmen cost us $120 for the night and they did not care about us having 3 children. Another bonus was the parking which was included in the above price. Our car was secure and unlike the others was the cheapest price quoted to us. Our children were excitted, as was I. The room was colorful, clean, nicely furnished and spacious for us all. The full sized beds were smaller then we were used to BUT they were the most comfortable we have stayed in yet. The best part must have been the pool and hot tub. Since we arrived late, lost an hour do to time change and it took us an hour to find a place, I had lost hope in us doing anything fun that evening. However, we had a night swim in the cozy pool that was open till 11 pm while enjoying the jazz music from the neighboring bars. Our children had a blast. I was actually sad to go and after visiting 4 hotels on our trip through 9 states the Frenchmen was my favorite. I would love to come back and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else.

We were able to walk a block from our hotel and sit and enjoy adult beverages and live music every night we were in NO, six in all. Jackson Square is a mere six blocks away, and if you are at all familiar with the French Quarter, a block is only 1/10th of a mile, so the entire quarter is within easy striking distance, including affordable restaurants and bars. We had the teeny tiny room located right off the main courtyard and found it quite charming. Let's face it, if you plan on staying in your room, why go to New Orleans in the first place. We too had partiers but we handled it in a calm manner - we went outside and joined them for a few minutes and chatted and consumed an adult beverage with them. When we parted, telling them we were heading to bed, they quieted down and we slept like babies. Our room was clean. The wet wash cloth on the tile floor test yielded a clean washcloth. Bed linen was crisp and fresh smelling. Housekeeping staff was very accommodating, so much so, we came back from a day in the quarter to find clean towels hanging on the door, the staff having honored our do not disturb. I will tell you the only serious shortcoming we noted - there is no elevator, so if you are not in good shape you will not like dealing with luggage. Unfortunately the hotel does not employ a bellperson. Oh, I forgot - you are only two blocks to the end stop of the riverfront trolley, which will take you all the way to Riverfront and the Harrah's Casino on Canal Street - $3 per day.

It comes complete with cockroaches crawling on the floor. The place is old and not in very good repair.

The bathroom, once again is so small there is not even a counter to set anything down on. The floor in the bathroom and shower has been painted over in an attempt to cover up the mold, but the paint is peeling off exposing the mold under the paint. The air conditioner never did get the room comfortable, even though it ran all night.

It is a very cute hotel that reminds me of a Bed&Breakfast. It is in a great location, end on French Quoter and in walking distance to every famous street, you want to visit. If you can, try to book a room that faces the courtyard - it is a pretty view on the pool and hot tub and very quiet. The street itself ( The Frenchmen street) has lots of bars and they play loud music until, probably, 1am, after that it is quiet. We had NO problem with any kind of noise because we didn't plan to be in NOLA and go to bed before midnight! It is so much fun to walk on the street around midnight, watch great crowd, artists selling their stuff, listen to different kind of music, can't imagine people complaining about the noise -it is part of fun vacation. Once again, after 1am, it is very quiet and peaceful. There is a bar next door, called MOJITO. What a great place! They have a fabulous Sunday brunch with live jazz and absolutely the best french toast, socked in creme-brulet and served with berries - MUST HAVE!!!! We were finishing our day every night at Mojito's, sipping our beer, listening great music, dancing and watching people! Awesome place! The hotel has a breakfast that is basically just coffee, donuts and some fruits but there are tons of places around within 3-5 walking minutes to have breakfast. Our favorite was the coffee shop Envy - the best breakfast in town and 5 minutes from the hotel! French Market is within 5 minutes from the hotel, also. Lots of fun and great place for souvenirs and some drinks. You will be 5 minutes walk from the river and street cars, 10 mins from Bourbon street and 15 mins - from Canal street. I mean, location of that little hotel is amazing! We enjoyed a horse carriage tour - highly recommended - so much fun and so much history! They will stop by the oldest bar in Nola and the best Hurricanes in town. The waiter will walk to your carriage and you can order your drinks right on the street. That bar was the only bar open 24/7 during Katrina. The only disappointment for us was that the hot tub in the hotel was broken. Hopefully it will be fixed before you get there, we were thinking how cool would be to sit in the hot tub every night because we did lots of walking :) The bed in our room was very soft and squishy. I'm sure it is a great bed for lots of people but we love very firm mattress, so that was not our best bed. Just want to mention that for people like us, who can't really rest on a soft bed. Be aware of people approaching you on the street with tricky questions ( \"I can tell you where you got these shoes on?\") and don't ask people on a street for direction - they will ask you to pay them. Get a map, talk to the receptionist in the hotel - The French Quarter is very easy to navigate so , if you have a map, you can get anywhere on your own :) You will see lots of young people with dogs who will ask you a dollar for dogs food - don't fall for that. If you really are an animal lover, get some dogs food in a sandwich bag and hand it to them - this way you will know the dog will get food, not the owner - a beer :) The receptionist in the hotel is there 24/7 so no matter what time you are back, they will always let you in and you feel secure and safe. We got there 2 hours early and they let us in the room without any problems. The staff is very nice and friendly, rooms are small and clean, a bit outdated but everything you need, is there.

It's almost like staying at your old eccentric aunt's house. I believe that Frenchmen Street is one of the most amazing streets in the world and it will not stay this way forever. Many of the music venues are cover free and full of amazing performances- we saw a band battle on the corner of a street where two bands fought for the rights to the corner with music. Now for the hotel- we stayed in I believe it was room 210- back in the corner- it was a little dark, the floor was sticky- king sized bed- old furniture. There were rolling beds et all stored in the hall corner. My friend had sent a bottle of champagne for our anniversary. It was in the room on ice. We took it to the pool which serves as the heart of the establishment. The pool is tiny and in the summer- everyone hangs out there- all night. It's NO and there are just less restrictions. Fun for those that like to hang out late but maybe not so fun for those that want a quieter experience. Now- this didn't really bother us but I could see someone else getting upset- one day before we were going out- brushing our teeth in the bathroom sink- a rubber pipe below it detached and started squirting water all over the room. We told the front desk and they had the handyman come. The problem was bigger than anyone realized and they moved us to a suite. The suite was significantly cleaner and nicer than the regular room- but it was funky as well. Bed is in an upstairs loft- no tv- downstairs to bedroom - seperate ac upstairs to keep it cool. Downstairs has couch, tv, closet, bathroom, nice patio with view of pool. The \"breakfast\" is pretty standard cheap hotel continental- with instant grits available of course. My husband helped a worker move some heavy furniture and they gave us a bottle of cheap bubbly. I thought that was very nice. You walk out the door and find Frenchmen in all its glory. There may be people making out on car roofs, trumpets being played while walking, drunken ridiculousness, people dressed to the 9s and homeless squatter kids as well as neighboorhood people selling bbq and vegetarian burritos. I imagine Frenchmen is what Bourbon St. was like 100 years ago before it lost all of its goodness and turned into trash. It is amazing- particularly during the week- Sat. not as much. I love New Orleans as it is special and not like any other place in the country- this is good in some ways and inconvenient in others.

They have the same decor and room layout, right down to the furniture and paint. We arrived exactly 13 days prior to Marti Gras, and were happy to find that nothing had changed since our last visit. Upon entering the room, the bathroom floor was wet, obviously from a recent mopping, still so very dirty that our feet and socks were literally black after only a visit to the sink and back. The bathroom sink would not drain, even after just a few seconds of running. 2 of the 3 light bulbs in the main light fixture over the bed were burned out. Closing the bathroom door from the inside left us standing with the handle in our hand and not in the door. The towels were pretty frayed and left lots of strings after use. When the air conditioner cycled down, it shook and rattled the entire mounting. Despite these things, the evening was quiet and spent in a nice atmosphere. The next night (Friday) the guests upstairs arrived. Crashing and banging above us was the entertainment for the evening (until 4am). Still, our spirits were great (it is New Orleans, after all). Saturday night, as the crashing and banging continued, I finally went to the front desk, where I was told that they would speak with the people upstairs. If it didn't stop, we could simply call the office and they would take further action. After about 30 minutes of drifting off to well needed sleep, the moving of furniture, drawer bang and whatever continued. Back to the office. This time we were told that the person above us had a wooden leg. REALLY? The night attendant apologized for the inconvenience, but nothing was done (I guess at this point I was the problem). We asked for simply a different room just to sleep though the night (there were open rooms), we were told there were none available. Sunday night. Repeat performance of the previous two nights. Finally at 4:15, we decided to leave for the rest of the night (again, this is New Orleans after all). Monday, after I asked the day attendant for a different room, we were told that the guests above had been moved to another room. The attendant was not aware of our problems the previous nights, but apologized profusely for our plight. A great night of blissful sleep. Would I stay here again, maybe. The location is great.

It can be a bit festive on Frenchman St. -- we went two weekends before Mardis Gras, so that is part of it, but we also heard punk & hard rock as early as 9am on a Monday from the bar across the street. But only once we stepped outside the hotel -- from our room in the back, behind the courtyard, it was peaceful. That was just the way we liked it -- adventures outside, sanctuary inside. We picked a 2-floor loft room (got #212), and always had a place to hide and nap before dinner and going out again. Our room was painted PURPLE and covered in Erte, Pinup girl & Absinthe artwork -- it was like they knew we were coming! They are undergoing renovations, so some things were brand new (furniture, art, etc.) and some things were older (bathroom doorknob, a/c). The rooms were not sprawling. But give them a break -- this is an older building in post-Katrina NOLA, and a private local business! There are dozens of chain or swanky boutique hotels in the Quarter and downtown if you want more space and services. I would advise splurging for the Lofts or Suites if you can swing it -- they are still cheaper than standard rooms elsewhere, and have more space to stretch out. Complimentary sherry around 5pm. Continental breakfast that was average, but good for a cup of coffee and a snack before heading out for a big brunch (Clover Grill, Cake Cafe, Stanley's). Cafe du Monde is just down the street. Unless I were on a romantic honeymoon-type getaway and wanted something really plush like room service and an in-room hot tub, I would stay here over and over again.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin,Tx", "Title": "\u201cNOT my hotel\u201d", "Author": "shoodieloo", "ReviewID": "UR96198028", "Content": "My man and I visited New Orleans in January for a quick two night stay. I had researched a long time to find the right hotel ,and decided on the Frenchman because of the great location and that the room I rented was a suite with a living room and a balcony. I had read a lot of good reviews and discredited a few bad ones. At first I only booked one night , in a suite through Bookit.com, and planned to stay the first night at my friends guest house few blocks away in the Marigny . A day after I booked our room on the Bookit.com website ,I decided to book our first night there as well and went directly to the Frenchmen's website , I found the same room available(for $20.00 more), and so I booked it for our first night too. When we arrived at the hotel we were put in room 200. It was a lovely room but it did not have a living area as pictured and promised. I went down to the desk and let them know and even showed them proof on their own website. I just kept being told that that was a suite and that I would need to speak to the manager tomorrow about it. Well, the next day we called Bookit.com and they called the hotel and let them know that they needed to move us to a suite,and we were moved to a suite albeit a MUCH dumpier room , In spite of it all being there in black and white to see they just chose to call a single,small, room with only a bed and a bathroom( and large walk through windows that did not lock) a suite. *see review titled \"do not stay in room 200\",in which the management did not call 200 a suite. Upon leaving I suggested that perhaps they should change the description and the pictures on their website and it appears that at least they have now changed it. I am often impressed when a manager responds to a complaint on these reviews, thinking that it indicates that they really do look after things and care,however if that were the case they should have fixed it then,rather then apologize later. My friend had wanted me to stay free in her guest house but I wanted to stay in in this \"quaint/funky\" hotel which ultimately did us wrong.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashland, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cGreat Balcony and view.\u201d", "Author": "KentuckyNurse73", "ReviewID": "UR95119997", "Content": "I have stayed here twice.

A couple of these reviews discussed the noise levels at this hotel, particularly the noise from the bar across the street. In spite of the reveiws, I decided that I would reserve a room anyway and give it a try. I arrived exhausted after an 11 hour drive at 2:30 am. The noise from the clubs and street was extreme. It was as if the band had set up in the middle of my hotel room. The light that shone from the street was very bright in the room. The band did not stop playing until around 4:00 am. Needless to say, I did not get any rest. Sunday night was a littlle better, but I was awakened by the street cleaner and by a garbage truck at 4:00 am. There was also a fire station about 20 yards away and I could hear the radio communication. This hotel is very noisy. When I called to make the reservation I asked the clerk, Kenisha, about the reviews (noise levels) and she stated that it was \"not that bad...It doesn't bother me\". Evidently, she does not sleep at the hotel since she is a first shift clerk. THE NOISE IS THAT BAD! Even without the noise, this hotel is not worth the the price that I paid (and this was a reduced rate of 99.00 +tax= 113.00 per night). The hotel is damp, dark and dank because it is old. I really don't understand the great reviews posted concerning this hotel. I am not pretentious or upscale in my taste at all. I am easily pleased with cleanliness, friendly service and a fair price. The hotel was marginal on all of these accounts. The only positive about the hotel is the location. If you are going to New Orleans to party into the wee hours of the morning and to sleep very little, then this is the hotel for you. I also realize that the management does not take responsiblity for customer conplaints that are part of the reviews. There is always an excuse, or an attempt to discount or discredit the reviewer. I feel like I had been \"had\", so to speak. I got that feeling about the city of New Orleans, in general. Seemed that everywhere I turned someone was attempting to squeeze a dollar, I had really expected more from this city. After a full day and two nights of this hotel and the City of New Orleans, I felt that I could not peel the scum off of my flesh with a set of pliers. The only real enjoyable aspect of the trip was a band that played at the Krazy Korner on Bourbon Street, several street performers, the roadfest food festival, and the Cafe du Monde. I have never been so happy to leave a city or a hotel. New Orleans has lost it's real authenticity, and is nothing more than a commercialized, superficial, oversized, sleazy beer joint.

Therein lies the problem. A new club has evidently opened within the past month DIRECTLY across the street from this old house converted into a hotel. I would not wish the sleep experience we had there on my worst enemy. At about 12 every night, this HORRIBLE music began. It wasn't jazz, it wasn't rock, I couldn't discern vocals, and there was no break - i.e, it wasn't songs just loud, horrible ongoing music!!!! Like a marching band. It was so loud that things in our room were vibrating - no lie. I tried earplugs, pillows on my head, turning the fan on - this club (VASO was the name) was unbearable. Sunday Vaso was closed - however the room (101) was still quite really noisy. You could hear the front door slamming all night, and folks coming home after a night out. Icing on the cake is the bed we nicknamed the \"half-pipe\" - it was so overly soft that we rolled into the middle. Not nice. So, my suggestion is if you are planning on staying out until 3 or 4 a.m., go ahead and stay here. Otherwise, DO NOT STAY HERE until they tell you that Vaso has been shut down.

We had a few minor issues i will get out of the way first: The onsite free parking we were told about was full when we arrived. they only have about 6 spots. So we had to park at their sister hotel about 2 blocks away. Not that big of a deal considering you dont need your car much in NOLA anyways. We were told our room would have a mini fridge which is a BIG must for us when we travel. It didnt have one, we were told there were no other available rooms with one either, but we were welcome to use the fridge in the lobby. On top of that, the ice machine was broken. lame. The staff was very helpful though, and the guy at the front desk even walked down the street and got us a bag of ice for our cooler, very nice of him! We were assured that the fridge issues and ice machine issue were to be taken care of during future renovation. As for their free breakfast they advertise- it was hot tea and coffee and toast. No juice, cereals, def no fresh pasteries or bagels or fruit you'd expect with a continental breakfast. But now on to the good stuff! Our room was adorable and spacious. We had a beautiful bathroom, awesome furniture, etc. It is a really historical hotel and definitely represents the feel of new orleans. if you are looking for the luxury of a CHAIN hotel, little bottles of shampoo and a mint on your pillow you are in the wrong place. But if all you need is character, fresh towels, good water pressure and a big comfy bed- this place has you covered. Everything was clean. Fixtures and such were obviously old.. but everything was in working order. Our room was romantic and unique. Our bathroom door didnt lock, but who cares. but my favorite part of this hotel? The pool, courtyard and roof! The pool is a little smaller in the photos then it looks, but its big enough for a swim or laying out with a book. The hot tub is AWESOME. I love how the pool and hot tub are nestled in the courtyard, it is very private. There is a BEAUITFUL roof with a great view, perfect for a morning cup of coffee and some sunrise yoga, or drinks in the evening. There are chairs for sunbathing during the day up there was well. And last but not least- location! Within walking distance of all the great hot spots in new orleans, but not spack dab in the middle of it all. The neighboor is great. There are so many great restuarants and clubs, perfect places for dinner or catching some live music. There is an AWESOME AWESOME lebanese cafe across the street- it made it so easy for us to pick up quick lunch or breakfast before heading out. Walkable convenice stores, a few shops, it is just a great area. The best part of this hotel is the great price we got. I have a feeling that with a little bit of renovation (looks like they are doing this already) this place is gonna be a huge hot spot.

It's good for such a small hotel that they have front desk staff 24 hours, and the woman who was there when I checked in was very eager to help, so that was also nice. When we pulled up in front, I blurted \"Oh this is cute!\" - the place is really charming, especially because we had a second floor room that overlooked the street in front. There was a balcony that would have been perfect for drinking bourbon and smoking cigarettes if I hadn't quit smoking and if I had had the time to drink any bourbon. So even though I recognize there were a lot of things to like about it, given that I was only in town for a short while,some of the things I really would have appreciated were somewhat lacking. The room didn't feel especially clean, and bathroom fan didn't work - it also didn't have a working lock on the bathroom door. Given our short stay, I didn't even bother to alert the front desk of either of these things, because I didn't want to have to deal with moving rooms and maybe missing out on a little bit of rest. Also - and this might be a nit-picky thing - the bed was really high off the ground. Usually having a meeting with colleagues in a hotel room is OK with a person sitting on a bed, but the bed was so high, it felt weird to be talking to someone who was sitting on the couch. That's not seriosu enough to be a negative, but I noticed it. The swimming pool is a lot smaller than it looked on the website - but was inviting nonetheless. There was good coffee in the lobby, and the neighborhood feels like an authentic New Orleans neighborhood. Like when a movie takes place in New Orleans, a lot of it takes place in this kind of neighborhood.d Whether that's really authentic, I don't know, but it felt it. If you're a young couple or group of friends who want to be able to choose whether you party or take it easy, then this is probably a good place. If you're sticking around for more than a night and appreciate atmosphere, then I'd definitely recommend it.

This seemed like a very good value for a suite that could accommodate up to 5 guests. Calling a day before I would arrive to confirm my reservation, I was informed that they would not be able to put me in the suite that I reserved two months earlier, nor would they have a room for me on the Frenchmen property, rather their adjacent inn -The Lamothe House-. The room given to me was larger than your typical hotel room, but not one as spacious as expected, plus we had a myriad of maintenance issues (i.e. bathtub faucet leaking, bathtub drainage, wi-fi signal too weak to reach suite-only available in lobby, door separating us from the next suite had a broken latch--we wound up moving the sofa in front of the door to give us a little security). Despite the disappointment that we were in a different hotel than reserved, in an inferior room than expected, & had to pay $15 a day for parking, which I just learned from the last review was free at the Frenchmen, we were charged the full room rate & the full parking rate. Can you say \"Bait-and-Switch\"??? I urge TripAdvisor readers to support a more reputable operation.

I was disappointed by how run-down the hotel and by the rudeness of the staff. To be sure, the hotel (and New Orleans on the whole) has the element of being worn but charming. However, there is no excuse for being dismissive of guests -- especially in this economy. Every morning, the cleaning woman forgot something different. One day, it was the floor mat, the next day the hand towels. One day when I asked for cups as there were none, she had the audacitgy as to go into my room and verify that there were no cups in the room. I have no need to lie. There were no cups, period. In addition, my room was never swept or properly cleaned during my 6-day stay. From what I could tell, the only cleaning that was done was making the bed and swapping out the towels. And based on the dirt on the floor and dust every where else, cleaning was rarely done. On another occassion, I complianed to the desk clerk that people were partying in the hot tub at 4 a.m. His response was that I should have called the desk to report it at the time. Okay. But had the clerk been watching the cameras instead of the TV, he would have seen (and heard) the loud partying. Also, it's not the responsibility of the guests to maintain decorum. Finally, while my father was very very clear that he pay for his room with his credit card, they put both rooms on my credit card. This is yet another example of the hotel staff's lack of attention to detail and overall failure to provide a basic level of customer service. I love New Orleans and I know it's a party town. But we weren't staying on Bourbon Street and I have a right to expect a clean room and to not be questioned. There are many, many amazing places to stay in New Orleans, check those out instead of staying at the Frenchmen.

It is a small hotel and the location cannot be beat. It is super close to the french quarter, practically in the french quarter, as it is located at Esplande and Decatur. We were able to walk anywhere in the quarter that we wanted to; a jaunt down to Cafe du Monde was but 5 to 7 minutes. It was also extremely inexpensive for its location: we were paying $140 a night on New Year's Eve, which was amazing and wonderful. Apparently, it is less expensive on less desirable nights, as well. The courtyard was great; it was a wonderful place to gather. Since we were there with several other people (across several rooms), it was a great spot to meet before heading out for the day (or night). There was a hot tub we took advantage of, and a pool. Most of the rooms face onto the courtyard and it has a great feel to it. Loved, loved, loved the charm of the place. Our hotel room had a tile floor and black out curtains, which kept it really, really dark all day (perfect for New Orleans). Per the downsides, there were several: first, I was told that rooms on the first floor facing the courtyard could be noisy; apparently, whatever was going on out there sounded like it was going on in your room. Second, the rooms were all pretty small, and the sheets pretty scratchy. The pillows were old and not comfy (but the bed was soft). The linens were dated. Third, and perhaps most important or our biggest complaint, the shower was bad. Weird little stream of water coming out and it would go from hot to cold to hot in the blink of an eye - definitely not an ideal showering experience; we also didn't have enough towels, and they weren't very good. However, those gripes pale in comparison to the pluses of the Frenchman, and I definitely recommend this hotel, especially to those traveling in groups on a budget.

It was our first visit to this hotel, although we had stayed at its sister establishment, the Lamothe House, last year and had been satisfied with that experience. We booked our reservations at Bookit.com and paid an average nightly rate of about $88 including all taxes and fees plus \"Enhanced Continental Breakfast Daily\" and \"Free Hotel Parking\" (more on these last two items later). Firstly, kudos to managers Joe, Betsy, and Kaniesha (sp.?) for their great customer service. All three could not have been more friendly and accommodating, and they made our stay all the more pleasant. Overall, our stay met our expectations given the price we had paid. We particularly appreciated the convenience of the hotel's location in the Marigny district, just one block east of the French Quarter, and the availability of hotel parking (nominally $15 per day) at no additional cost. The Frenchmen has 7 garaged parking spaces and four curbside spaces designated for loading. Upon arrival we were assigned to room 208, which we found had several issues, among them a missing TV remote, defective bedside lamp, non-functioning bathroom ventilator, and burned out vanity bulb. When we brought these items to Joe's attention, he immediately offered to find us another room. Knowing that the hotel was fully booked for Saturday the 27th, I asked Joe whether we would be able to keep the new room for the duration of our stay and he said that he would do some juggling to see to it that we could. Our new room, no. 209, was perfectly acceptable. Problem efficiently and cordially solved. When we checked in we were concerned about the availability of the limited garage space for all four days; this was a key factor for us in choosing this hotel based on the scarcity of free parking in N.O. and the high cost of garaging. But Joe, who had issued us our parking pass, assured us that he would never issue more passes than he had spaces available. Nonetheless, the one time we left the garage, on Sunday the 28th, we returned to find all spots occupied. Betsy, who was then on duty, explained that the part-timer who had been manning the desk that day had apparently not kept track of the arrivals. Betsy apologized for the mix up and directed us to one of the curbside spaces. Problem solved with just minor irritation. Know that the Frenchmen is an older facility, with all the charms and drawbacks that entails. We particularly enjoyed returning to our room to find the New Orleans experience continues in the form of a bare brick interior wall with fireplace, high ceilings, French doors, hardwood floors, and antique furniture. However, if you require the most modern of plumbing and electrical conveniences or upscale linens and towels, you will be disappointed. No terry-cloth bathrobes here! The only aspect that caused us any discomfiture was the overly soft and saggy bed mattress. But then again, we were not expecting luxury and were not overly inconvenienced. Our biggest disappointment was probably the \"enhanced\" breakfast. Having previously stayed at the Lamothe House, we thought we knew what to expect. Not so. Other than coffee, tea, sugar-based O.J., cold (mostly sugar-coated) cereal, and instant oatmeal packets, the only nourishment offered was PB&J and bread, and (to us) unappealing sugar-coated doughnuts. When I asked Joe about the availability of fresh fruit, he replied that they had lost their vendor and were looking for another. I accepted his explanation, but, really, how hard it is to find a source of fresh fruit in N.O.? Given the claim of an \"enhanced\" continental breakfast, I would have expected the management to provide a better product. Again, overall we enjoyed our stay and felt we were well treated and were provided adequate value for our dollar.

The two suites are separate, but they are joined by a foyer that has an outer door that can be locked from the inside. It was very nice: BIG, airy, lots of places to store things. The major suite has a large sitting room with a very comfy couch and several chairs. There's a dining area with a table and chairs just off of the kitchen. Did I mention there's a kitchen?? It's got a full size fridge and dishwasher. The only thing missing is an oven/stove, but there was a microwave. The bathroom was large, with 2 sinks. The tub/shower was smallish, I'd like to have had a detachable shower head, but all in all it was nice. The walk-in closet is as big as some rooms I've stayed in! The bedroom was of a good size, with a HUGE, very comfortable bed and 2 doors leading out to the balcony. The balcony overlooking Frenchmen street on Halloween had to be one of the best things about staying here. It was noisy and went on forever, but we *were* there to party! The balcony is shared by our suite and the adjoining suite. Since we were together, it made it a nice way to open up the whole space to all of us. The two suites are connected by a foyer that has an outer lock so you can leave the suite doors open, and with the outer door locked, no one can come in from outside. If you don't know the guests in the other suite, all of this may be problematic for you, as you might feel yourself lacking a little privacy (ie, the doors from the bedroom to the balcony have only very shear curtains!)

For the midweek price, it could be said that for the price it couldn't be beat and anything would suffice. The location on Frenchmen St. is convenient to both Jazz clubs and restaurants down the road in the Marigny along with the French Quarter only a few blocks away. Over our recent stay in NOLA, my boyfriend and I had the opportunity to stay at three different properties in the Marigny, which made for an interesting opportunity to make a comparison between similarly priced options. Although the desk staff was always approachable and friendly, the \"Queen\" room that we stayed at (Room 103) was much more cramped than expected, since we had made the decision to opt spending more money for more space. When I approached the staff to verify that it was indeed the right room, I was told that the Standard rooms are \"really small\". We found it hard to believe that it would be possible, since the door brushed up against the bed when you opened it and the space around the bed only allowed for one person to pass at a time. It must be noted that my boyfriend is 6'3 so space is mildly important for us. When the cleaning people were cleaning out Room 101 the next morning, we got a glimpse into what amazing space another room had and we asked for next time what to order in order to get such a luxurious space with two bed stands and room to leap into the room before reaching the bed. To our surprise, this was a Queen size room as well, so just be aware that there is great variation between what constitutes this size of room, so you may wish to phone the Frenchmen ahead of time in order to make a special request for one of the larger rooms. Opening up the door, the smell of cleaning products (a kind of bubble gum mixed with chemical odor) nearly knocked us over. I have to admit that I'm traditionally sensitive to smells, but after 3 nights, there was still a faint smell of chemicals and we had request to not have our room cleaned out with the stuff out of fear that we'd only have to air out the room more so. All that being said, it really wasn't a horrible place, though the price over the weekend in my opinion would not justify staying here vs. a slightly larger and personable space in a local B&B. During the week, it would really be up to you...the breakfast was endless tea/coffee and simple bread/donuts weren't bad. There weren't insects or mold infesting the space, and the only negatives I mentioned in previous paragraphs. Next time, I think I would opt to spend $30 more a night for a B&B but that's only my personal opinion, but if you want a cheap place that's central and no frills, then this is the Hotel for you. Also, if you're a small family, the Suites I was told are a great value and nice space. As you can tell from my review, leaving the Frenchmen, we were torn about how we felt, so I'm deeming this an average stay. You should note that we're pretty no-frills travelers, staying predominantly in guesthouses, B&Bs and hostels when we venture, so value comes down to being a matter of price and expectations.

Rooms are just the right size (when you use it as a stop-and-go in daytime and to sleep. They are, most of all, very clean altough not new. We were in a room just by the poolside with old frenchdoors (very romantic, but you hear pretty much everything that people in the pool do/say. especially true when the A/C is taking a break in-between 2 refreshing cycles.) Pool rules say that it closes at midnight but there's always somebody to have a smoke (rooms are non-smoker, a very big ++) or a last cooling dip before sleeping. We had to intervene only once for a group of youngster coming back from Bourbon street were continuing the party by our door at 2:30 am. Otherwise the average residents were couples and congressists. No kids when we were there. Of course week-end tends to be noisier for younger croud comes in. The bathroom is on the small side without counter space but a 2-shelves metal unit hanging overt he toilet was doing the job. The only negative side would be not enough towel rack space. Breakfast was fair but i would have like to see some variety during the week. Doughnuts, toast, oatmeal and cereal are great but could get very monotonous after few days. furthermore I was kinda expecting to see some french croissant or some muffins somewhere during the week (ok ! it's the french in me that speaks but eating sugarglazed doughnuts every morning is not my forte!!) ;o) Staff (front desk and room service) was very friendly and helpful.

After careful consideration of several options I booked a loft at the Frenchmen as an alternative to the Bourbon Street scene. Since we wouldn't be spending that much time in our room (or so I thought), I believed the loft would be adequate. In hindsight I wish I had reserved a suite but that is my fault, not the hotel's. The heat proved to be too much for us and we retreated to our room and the pool during the heat of the day, emerging like vampires as the sun sunk on the horizon. Not that there were not small issues. After all, it was vacation, not the after life. It appeared a previous guest had tried to keep raw seafood in the fridge and it stunk to high heaven so we just didn't open it again. Management assured us they would replace it. Too late for us but I hope the next guests in Room 211 fair better. The ceiling fan upstairs didn't work but we were quite comfortable since the air conditioners (both up and down stairs) worked well. The sleeper sofa had not been prepared with linens nor were there additional linens in the room, and it tried to fold up on the girls when they retired that first night. I approached a staff member about a rollaway bed instead. I heard nothing further so we helped ourselves to one parked near our room. The toilet became stopped up and the clerk saw to it immediately. The jets on the jacuzzi (by the pool) were too noisey and shot water into the air, and the pool pump seemed to have a technical issue our last day there, but for the most part we enjoyed both the pool/courtyard and the other guests with whom we visited there and in the dining room during continental breakfast. Do yourself a favor. One day when you step out the lobby door, hang a right instead of a left. All in all, we found the Frenchmen to be relaxed, charming and a good value. If we have the opportunity we definitely would stay there again.

Wanted a good location in a \"neat\" hotel for my daughter's 21st birthday trip, her first trip to NOLA and my 2nd. The Frenchmen had been called \"funky\" by a very famous travel guidebook, it is in the Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, in a late 1800's coverted Creole townhouse. Just the photos of the place alone were enough for me! There were going to be 3 of us, and after reading the room descriptions, I booked a suite. The booking site also offered free parking, which from my first visit to NOLA I knew couldn't be beat. We had stayed in a diffferent hotel on the other side of the quarter for our first night. While we were walking around the quarter that night, we ended up near the Frenchmen, and upon spotting the outside of the place, pointed to a 2nd story streetfront balcony and said \"I want THAT room!\". The next morning we checked out of our other hotel ( it was really great, too) and drove over to the Frenchmen where we got buzzed into the lobby. I asked if perhaps, as I knew we were really early, we might possible park the car. The lovely young lady at the front desk checked our reservation and said \"Well, your room is ready, you could check in now if you'd like\". It wasn't even noon, so of course! We checked in, parked the car, and went up our suite. The access to our suite was from a flight of stairs off the pool courtyard, at the rear of the property. We walked into a little hallway, and voila! This wasn't a suite, we had a 1 bedroom apartment. The furniture was comfy. The floors are tile. The bedroom was separate, with a door and a window (!) to the hall, and a nice queen sized bed with 2 end tables and lamps. There was an iron and ironing board in the closet, but the mirrored closet doors were just \"in\" the closet. The bedroom being separate meant that my daughter and her best friend ( along for the birthday) could keep the room as tomb dark as they liked and talk as long as they wanted, and I could watch TV or sleep in the other room, if I wanted. The full bath had a regular bathroom vanity, and a medicine chest. With 3 women in a 1 bath apartment, there was plenty of space to put cosmetics, etc. We asked for and got extra towels. The toiletries were nice. There was also plenty of place to put the extra towels. We had a kitchen!! With a fridge, microwave and dishwasher. You could see where there had been a stove, not that we needed one. Having a separate kitchen meant nice cold water, sodas and heating up leftovers, loaded the ice bucket once, and we had counter space to boot. There was also a dining table with a leaf, in case we had company for dinner, I guess. The living room had a fairly comfy sofa bed, 2 end tables with lamps, and 2 other chairs, and a armoire with a TV/DVD player. And the best part was our balcony, with a bistro table and chairs. The balcony was shared with the room next door, but somehow, we never ended up out there at the same time. The location was great, at the intersections of Esplanade, Decatur and Frenchmen. There was a firehouse right across from us, and we could see the Old Mint from the balcony. We could walk down to the streetcar ( end of the Riverfront line), or walk out to the Esplanade Bus. Breakfast was continental, with pastries, coffee, cereals and toast. I walked down/up Frenchmen to Loretta's and bought some yummy \"extra\" treats, and also to a small bakery across from Loretta's ( corner on N.Rampart and Frenchmen), as the girls over-slept breakfast Sat and Sun. Coffee was available all the time. There's a soda machine on site, and an ice machine. There are a couple of small grocery stores in the Quarter, which make our \"apartment\" even better. The Frenchmen has a neat feel about it. You MUST have a key to enter the property, or be buzzed into the lobby by the front desk. The dining room ( for breakfast) has a real dining room feel about it. Entrance to the rooms is from a side door from the lobby, where you walk down a brick walkway to the courtyard. There's a nice pool and hot tub, which was great for soaking for a before/after dinner break. There's a small toilet area off the pool courtyard. Off this same courtyard is walking access to the parking lot, and above the parking lot is a huge sundeck with tables and chairs for enjoying the music from Frenchmen street venues. The parking lot is gated. We didn't move the car once we parked it, we used the streetcar/bus pass. I can't wait to come back to New Orleans. We will definitely use the Frenchmen again. I DO recommend buying a VISITOUR pass, we bought a 3 day pass, and it was an excellent deal. Book online, you can find free parking and if you can, book a suite! The Marigny neighorhood is a real neighborhood, walk around, meet the people who live there.

I want the place to be affordable because I'm there to spend my money on food and entertainment. I'm not planning on hanging out in the hotel room all day everyday. We stayed at the Frenchmen for 5 nights in July of '07 (that was even BEFORE new management) and we LOVED it! The building is over 100 years old so let's take that into consideration. There are a few things that may look a little aged but that's part ot the beauty of the place. That's part of the beauty of New Orleans, period. The actual rooms that I saw were in fine condition. We had a room on the back side of the courtyard. I saw the inside of three of the rooms in that corner area. They were all small but each was unique, cozy, and nice. We had a good size restroom and there was a mini fridge in our room. We are smokers and all we had to do was step outside the door and relax at a little table by the cute little pool/spa to enjoy our coffee and cigarette. I didn't get in the spa but the pool was refreshing in July. All of the staff was friendly to us. We checked in early. They held our bags and called a cab for us when we left. Our room was clean. The floors were tile so, sure, they picked up road dust if you didn't remove your shoes but I wasn't sweating it because I know that's what tile and hardwood do. Housekeeping came by around 10ish. When we weren't there they cleaned the room. When we were we asked only for fresh towels. I'm certain they would have cleaned the entire room if I had asked but I don't change the sheets and dust/sweep/mop every single day at home either. One night, I got separated from my bf in the Quarter and went on back to the hotel. I told the nightman as I passed through the lobby that I may be locked out but was going to check the room first and I'd let him know. I checked the door. It was locked. When I turned around to go back to the lobby he was standing behind me holding out a key. I don't know about you but I call that service! Most mornings we grabbed a pastry and coffee from the hotel. Some of the pastries were fresh and some were wrapped. I assumed the wrapped ones were for the late sleepers or a late night snack...worked for me anyway. They also had bread for toast, bagels, milk and orange juice. Community coffee (regular and chicory) were available all day and they offered to make a pot if it had run out. We had breakfast one morning at La Peniche right down the street. and it was good also. We met a two couples at the pool/hot tub and had a wonderful time with them. One couple had a car and they drove us uptown to Jaques-Imo's for dinner. It was fabulous and we had a great time! On our last night, there was a family who stayed at the pool rather late and were a bit noisy but apparently, there were no complaints. I turned on the TV to drown them out and I was so exhausted by then I went right on to sleep. The hotel is in an awesome location. We flew in and didn't have a car. We walked everywhere we went...even all the way to Canal. Walking in the best way to be able to take everything in. We did ride the streetcar once and it dropped us right around the corner. We had some great times with the locals on Frenchmen. There are some truly gifted musicians in the area and everyone was really friendly. New Orleans is a truly WONDERFUL place to visit. Everyone we encountered including hotel staff, restaurant staff, locals, and other guests were great people. You won't find any food or music anywhere that can rival what is offered in New Orleans.

We arrived at 10:30am, hours before scheduled check-in. Without a moment's hesitation, the desk manager offered his office for our luggage and took my cell number to call as soon as our room was ready. We were able to check in by 1pm. Our room was extremely tiny but quaintly decorated. The goldenrod walls were accentuated with prints reflecting french cats. The bed, while only a double, was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was roomy enough for general purposes, but only had a shower stall. It did have double doors, however, so I felt very french, indeed. The room also had a double glass french door, which was covered in a dark curtain, so light was kept out. Same cannot be said for the lovely stained glass window over the door, however. I don't require a pitch black room to sleep, so this was not a problem. Looking around the courtyard, I did notice ours was the only room with this stained glass window. I tend to overpack, and what woman doesn't?? We literally had clothes everywhere, yet housekeeping was not deterred. The one time we neglected to pick up our clothes from the floor, the housekeeper folded everything, even my boyfriend's socks, neatly on the bed. It looked like turndown service, only in reverse. The courtyard was small, but colourful. The pool was clean and refreshing after an 88 degree afternoon listening to music at the FQF. Two tables in the yard wasn't always enough as other people had the same idea regarding relaxing in the evening. Breakfast was an adequate affair of coffee and other hot beverages, pastries, cereals and fresh fruit. The staff was quite friendly and eager to answer any questions we had. I requested extra towels once and they were left on the bed when housekeeping completed the room for the day. There was an iron and ironing board in the room, but the ironing board wouldn't stay upright. We improvised by simply laying it on the bed. I'm not sure if the unit refrigerator worked or if we simply didn't know how to turn it on. There is a safe for your valuables in the room, as well.

The pool is great for just taking a dip and we were happy to discover that the 12:00 AM closure was more of a mild suggestion than anything else. If you end up driving, they do have a secure parking lot, however there are very few spaces for cars and moving around inside of it is very tight at best, I would recommend parking somewhere else if you have a large car, although it is secure, at $15 a night there are better deals to be found in the area.

Then when I turned it back on, I smelled it. It was killing me. Door knob had no latch in it. Extra latch on the door also did not work. Bed sheets were clean, comforter had stains on the inside. Some of these things would not bother people, especially if you go there just to get drunk and don't get back to your room until 2am or so..However, if you have children, I do not recommend this room. Pay the extra $$ and stay elsewhere (just not on Bourbon). The thing is, the french quarter is so dirty, that for ME, I would've liked to have come to a nice clean room. Our family likes to come back to the room a few times during the day to just rest our feet and chill out for a half an hour or so. I dreaded coming back to the room, so we just stayed out. If you are like me, then you would do better in a nicer room.", "Date": "August 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cnice staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2490006", "Content": "Very nice staff & very good Continental breakfast. Also, great location near French Market. Some good restaurants within walking distance. However, the room I stayed in was about the size of a walk in closet. The bathroom was extremely tiny with hardly any water pressure. Also, there was a large crack where the door to the outside of the room did not close properly. I was told that there were larger, much nicer rooms on the premises, but none were available at that time. I would suggest to anyone considering the Frenchmen for the first time to ask very specific questions about your accomodations.

Great location too! Just a couple of blocks from all the downtown activity, yet very quiet. We took the \"Magic Tour\" while we were in the quarter one night and I highly reccomend that SPECIFIC tour! Ron (the tour guy) was great.

I think it is important to keep in mind that this establishment is not a luxury hotel nor does it try to present itself as such. The room was indeed small, but other than a place to sleep and use the shower, it wasn't as though I spent that much time in the room anyhow. The room was neat and clean and was serviced each day. The pool is small, but that's because it's in the courtyard area. It worked just fine as far as cooling me off after a day in the Quarter. Jacuzzi was up and running and was plenty hot! I spoke with the night desk clerk who stated that a new general manager took over about 3-4 weeks ago and he has been working on getting things running more efficiently. You can't beat the location and I felt the price was reasonable as well.

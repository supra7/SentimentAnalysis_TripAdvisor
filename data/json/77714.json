It's true what they say the quality of service can make a difference. Front desk personnel needs to work on their greeting and manners I've worked in the hotel industry before I know that guest staying in the hotels are away from home either business or pleasure and a smile or professionalism can make a huge difference. If people are having a bad day that should not affect your performance at work if it does then stay home. I was very irrate to ask for help with a simple request and be met with attitude I paid 170 only to take my simple request and walk to a near by establishment and resolve it myself. I would not recommend this hotel try it for yourself call in before you stay to confirm and you'll find yourself having to call 2 different numbers or only to have someone on the other end tell you front desk is closed???

I booked the daycation package and wrote the staff a comment when I reserved it through your online reservation site that I really need this to be a special stay..and pre-thank them for making sure all is ready to go. We arrived at the hotel around 3:30pm and when I began to check in they said they had booked us a room with 2 queen beds and had no record of the daycation package purchased. I showed them my confirmation email on my phone and they said they didnt have any record of it in their files and asked if I could email it to them. Upset since I had planned the package as a surprise my husband used my phone to email it to 3 different addresses the check-in agent asked him to. When we got to our room we set our things down and heard music blaring loudly from another area of the hotel, there was a wedding going on outside in the garden and we were not able to go through the Japanese gardens as a party was in process. I booked this hotel since his family owns an architectural landscaping firm and I thought he'd enjoy seeing it...we could not even take a look outside. We walked to dinner nearby and later returned to the hotel to order up the champagne included in the package and rent our movie also. When we tried to order the staff said they had no record of it in their computers still so we were charged separately until they said it showed up and they could process a refund. His flight the following morning was at 8:40 am from LAX so we woke up at 6am hoping to get ready and check out. When we were checking out I noticed that we were charged for a movie and when I brought this up to the girl at the check out desk she said shed review the order and make sure that she took it off. We left and I dropped him off at LAX for another 9 months away...when I checked my credit card statement it appears that I was charged twice for our stay-both in different amounts. I will be calling the hotel tomorrow to talk to them about this. Terrible stay, we did not even receive a portion of what I booked and I will not be seeing my husband again for a long time.

We saw the rooms gradually get more and more dingy to the point where we no longer stayed here, but we came back when they started upgrading and remodeling. The location is wonderful, especially if you appreciate being right next door to Little Tokyo, with its Japanese markets, restaurants, and the Kinokuniya Bookstore. Many Japanese guests stay in the hotel, and the breakfast buffet has a couple of (so so) Japanese dishes. We are hoping that the Hilton chain will have sense enough not to destroy the unique Japanese flavor of this hotel. (Are they really going to call it the \"Doubletree by Hilton\" and let it go at that?) The hotel is also within easy walking distance (10-15 minutes) of the Disney Concert Hall, the LA City Hall, Olvera Street, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Los Angeles Union Station, the discount stores of the Garment District and Toy Districts, and the Japanese American National Museum. Freeway access is also excellent. We were disappointed in the buffet breakfast in the Azalea Restaurant. If the food was any good, then the $18 price might be acceptable, but it is very mediocre quality and showed a general lack of care in preparation. The way-overcooked scrambled eggs and the tasteless, soggy (even when freshly put out!) potatoes were especially nasty. Unfortunately it was too expensive to put together an interesting breakfast from the a la carte menu. The only sensible choice for us was the American Breakfast (eggs, potatoes, meat, toast, juice and coffee/tea) at $12, which is actually quite good and which of course benefits from being cooked to order. I complained about the buffet breakfast when I stayed here last November and the manager wrote me back that they were planning to improve it, but I didn't see any change on our current trip. Those potatoes are REALLY AWFUL! We found the hotel and restaurant service to be friendly and helpful -- no problems there. This hotel kind of nibbles away at you with extra charges, like $24 a day for parking and $10 a day for Internet connection. For parking, you can find cheaper places nearby if you look around, and I heard that the Starbucks just next door to the Azalea Restaurant has free Internet. For one minor gripe, I found it bizarre that you can't get a newspaper anywhere in the hotel. If you're lucky you might find an LA Times left in the vending machine outside (bring lots of quarters), or if you don't mind waiting in the long coffee line, you can get the New York Times, the LA Times, and the Wall Street Journal next door at Starbucks.

My complaint is with the terrible service I received from the front desk staff and not hotel amenities, although the condition of the room is a bit dated. The bathroom faucet would not stop dripping and the room ceilings looked like something from 1960s. When I first checked into the hotel on Friday morning (3am) the person at the front desk did not appear to know what he were doing. He seemed like he was arguing with the other person at the front desk about which room to give me. As a result, I was standing there at 3am for 20 minutes waiting for him to check me in. I understand if you are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but at 3am, the last thing a customer wants to do is wait for 20 minutes while you try to figure out what to do. Not to mention that I could barely understand what he was saying. When I had asked him how much the internet charge was, he told me $9.99 per day. The next morning at 8:30am, I was woken up to a drill (due to hotel renovation) in what felt like the room next door. Unfortunately, the drilling and construction work seemed to go on for the entire day. This means that if you plan to visit this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and try to work out of it, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on it since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely be distracted by the sound. As a matter of fact, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan to sleep past 8am either if you are a light sleeper like I am. When I finally called down to the front desk to complain, the staff replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you see the signs at the front.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd First, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I did not see any signs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and more importantly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153why would you put your hotel guests in a room where construction work was occurring next door?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She assured us that Friday was the last day that construction was going to occur. Saturday & Sunday morning at 9:22am, I started to hear the drills again. When I called down again, they said, oh we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this was happening but you can talk to our supervisor if you like. My reply was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to waste anymore time with this but will speak to your supervisor when I check out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I checked out, I had complained again, and they said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoh sorry, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have our supervisor give you a call to talk to you more about it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I politely left my number with them and have not yet received a call. Also, the internet charge for the room is $9.99 per computer although the front desk only told us $9.99 per day. For the same price, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay at a Kimpton property hotel or The Standard instead this hotel charges $25 per day for parking anyways.

The first thing to note is that the prices have gone up a little bit, but that's acceptable because compared to the other hotels in downtown LA, this one is still a bargain. I believe in my last review that I said they don't charge more for the renovated \"deluxe\" rooms (which are on the higher floors). However this time there was a difference of maybe +/- $20/night between the standard and deluxe rooms on their website. The next item is that the Kyoto is in the process of becoming a Doubletree by Hilton. I believe they said this should be completed sometime in the summer of 2012. For me this is long overdue, as I use this hotel frequently when downtown for business, and getting Diamond recognition and credit (points) for my stays is always a positive. But the drawback is that lots of things are being worked on and there were major maintenance issues during my stay last week (early Feb 2012). The deluxe room has a great large HD LCD tv in it, but this does you no good when there's only about 10 channels that come in at all. And at that, only half of those were of watchable because the picture quality was so horrific. There was no HD on any channel. Every channel that I enjoy watching when unwinding in the evenings was totally out (A&E and Travel Channel). On the first night I asked maintenance to come up and see if they could fix the television. The tech came up and said that the satellite people have known about it for a while and that they don't know when it is going to be resolved. I got a key to another room on a different floor just to verify the outage was affecting more than just my room. I suspect they aren't going to fix it, and am hoping they are just going to put a whole new TV system in place. Not being able to enjoy television (for me) is a HUGE problem. When I called the front desk to express my dissatisfaction, they said they could comp a day of my parking, which they did, but that didn't do anything for me whatsoever since it was a business trip and it was me, not the company, that was having to deal with the problem. It would have been so much better if they would have offered me a room credit that I could have applied toward all the times I ate/drank in the lounge. The next thing is the water. In my last review I stated that the bathrooms in even the deluxe rooms are very old. Old to where when you turn the light on in the bathroom you can hear the lights \"clink\" on, and the sink/vanity is VERY low. But on this trip they must have been doing work with the plumbing and water pressure, because on one occasion when I turned on the water, nothing came out, I heard a loud bumping noise and then it shot water out like an explosion and ended up all over me and my pants. Not the best situation when you're about to walk downstairs for dinner. On another occasion during my stay, I turned on the water and again heard the grumbling sound in the pipes and it shot out brown/dirty water. And on the morning I checked out, a note was under the door that they were doing maintenance and that the water supply for the entire hotel would be turned off for short period of time. Here's the thing about this hotel - the price is good and the people are terrific. They have a great staff and everyone from the bar to the room service to the valet are all wonderful. Being right downtown next to the Japanese village with great restaurants and shops is a huge bonus, and if you want to go a little further, the hotel has a free shuttle (remember to tip, people!). So I'd gladly give them another chance, but I truly hope that this Doubletree upgrade will involve a re-do of the bathrooms and vanities, fix the plumbing issues, and get a real TV channel line up with HD channels. Having those things would finally make this a truly fantastic hotel.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cJury Duty Stay\u201d", "Author": "califtraveler12", "ReviewID": "UR124162060", "Content": "Excellent location, very comfortable rooms.

I let him choose the hotel (here's where the learning starts!), and decided I would wear my \"easy going\" cap for this quickie trip. This hotel was a great deal on line and I loved the idea of a Japanese approach to our accommodations. After braving the rush hour traffic in LA to get to the hotel, we were in a hurry to check in and get to your dinner engagement. I had read on line that some of the rooms had been recently renovated, so checked with the person checking us in to make sure we were in one of the updated rooms. She replied that it was \"semi-renovated\" (learning continues...). Upon reaching our room, which was spatially adequate,it felt a little old and dingy. The bedding ensemble was new and styled very nicely ~ I think was the \"semi-renovated\" element our check-in attendant was referring to. There was also some new, very cool wall paper on the wall behind the bed. Everything else was very standard and in need of updating. Upon returning from our night out in Downtown LA around Staples center, we were famished and had walked around for a while trying to find something open to grab a late night bite at. With very little available, we took a cab back to our hotel and thought we'd order room service. Alas, no room service available. While there is a lounge in the hotel lobby, there is no food service. There is also a restaurant, but it closes early in the evening. I thought all of this was very strange, however it was a Thursday night. The front desk provided us with a Dominos Pizza menu and also found a menu for a Thai restaurant that delivers. The single desk attendant suggested we walk just a couple blocks down the street where we would find many restaurants open. We walked quite a long ways and there really was nothing open. This is not the best part of town I might add, and we felt it best to get back to our room. We ended up calling the Thai restaurant and ordering ~ eating at 1:30 am and it was pretty good. But really, in the future, I will not stay at a hotel without room service or adequate dining options close by. The bathroom, while functional and relatively clean had a loose faucet and just really needed to be updated. The bed however, was very comfortable and the bedding was nice ~ again, part of that semi-remodeled effort. If you're going to LA and will be out and about, not spending time in your room, it is definitely an adequate stay. I do think that you'll do better just a few blocks towards the center of downtown with other options such as the historic Millenium Biltmore which is actually great value. I won't choose to stay here again and definitely will do more research before I let my beloved do the choosing again.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix AZ", "Title": "\u201cFabulous stay!\u201d", "Author": "DesertDweller32", "ReviewID": "UR123239347", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Kyoto Grand.

We needed two beds and after a quick and friendly call to Marianne at the front office, she took care of the change for us. We called the hotel with a couple of other questions before our trip, and we were always treated kindly and given thorough answers to our questions. The bell staff were very friendly at check in, Self Parking ($24 per night) was a breeze. The front desk team was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. We had a room on the 20th floor and it had a nice view of downtown.

We were actually able to leave the a/c turned off and just enjoyed the cool, autumn breezes. The beds/linens are FANTASTIC!!! I have stayed at the Ritz/4 Seasons/JW Marriotts/etc, and these beds/linens were equally as wonderful as any of those high end, pricey hotels. Another nice touch in the room is having a small fridge. No mini-bar items to deal with... just an empty fridge in the room, waiting for us and our beverages! The only room for improvment would be better toiletries... They were some low-end hotel brand, when it would be nice to have L'Occitane/Bath & Body Works/Crabtree...etc... Not a big deal, at all...just the only thing I could think of where this stay could have been improved re: the room and amenities. The one other major place that MUST be improved: The business center is basically non-existent. There is only ONE working computer and the printer is hit and miss, at best. Since there is only 1 working PC, there was always someone camped out on it, with other guests, waiting. If you don't need a printer and have your laptop with you, you can go to Starbucks in the hotel and access their wi-fi. We enjoyed a nice dinner at Azalea Restaurant, one night.

With that in mind, i will tell you this: I have never had as bad an hotel experience as I did here at Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens. Here for my best friend's wedding, the hotel was chosen due to its location and famed garden. Strike 1: I was told upon check- in that there were no more rooms available on the 21st floor despite the fact that much communication was made on the importance of saving rooms on this floor for our bridal party members and the fact that I'd booked the room 1.5 months prior Strike 2: after specifically requesting a room with 2 double beds, we were reassigned to another floor with a room with only 1 king bed. Strike 3: After going to the front desk, yet again, to tell them about the issue... somehow a room with 2 beds \"magically\" became available on the 21st floor, when it was already 11 pm and only 5 minutes prior, I was told the floor was completely booked. Strike 4: the newly assigned room had the most God-awful stench I have ever smelled in my life, even with the fan on. The smell was confirmed to be completely unbearable by several of my friends who came by to visit. It was too late into the evening to switch rooms again and due to our wedding party commitments, I couldn't request a room change until the next night. When I did, the front desk associate had a bad attitude. I told him about the situation and the disgusting, nauseating, permeating smell in the room. He was short with me and said \"it looks like you've already switched rooms.\" I was so angry by this point and wanted to scream at him and management: if they didn't keep messing up my reservation and put me in such a situation, I would NOT even need to be wasting my time in complaining to them and switching rooms over and over again. I was finally switched to yet another room. In short, I will tell you this: I have NEVER had such a bad hotel experience, not even at a low-end Motel 6 with cockroaches scurrying around (true story). I would NEVER stay at the Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens again, nor would I recommend it to anyone, not even my worst enemy.

We both had been trying to pick a hotel for weeks and read tons of reviews for several hotels. I finally made a decision and settled on the Kyoto Grand and it exceeded both of our expectations. Our original reservation through Expedia said we were getting one king bed, but when we checked in, the staff immediately offered us a room with two separate beds. Check-in was really fast. Our room was very clean and our beds were made up and our towels were changed daily. The beds are AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE! Even after long days of walking around and sightseeing, we always felt refreshed the next day. Our window in the room was facing the beautiful garden. The bathroom was a little bit dated compared to the rest of the room, but it didn't bother us as it was always clean and everything worked. The shower had good water pressure. All of the staff at the Kyoto was friendly and helpful. They answered all of our questions and recommended places to go to in the area. One lady from the front desk, (I believe her name was Marisela) was extremely helpful. She booked a sightseeing tour for us around 10pm for the next morning. I realized the gift shop had closed and I needed to buy batteries for my camera, so I asked her if she knew where I could buy some - she told me to wait a sec and called someone from the hotel to bring me batteries, free of charge! We were a little reluctant to walk downtown by ourselves because we heard it was not safe at night, but it was perfectly fine, even for just two women. Shops and restaurants in Little Tokyo are open late, so we always felt safe and there was always something to do in the area. Pitfire Pizza is also a block away from the hotel in the opposite direction of Little Tokyo, so we went there for dinner a few times. Union Station is in walking distance to the hotel, as are several bus stops for various routes if you plan on taking the Metro. The Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Fashion District are also close by. The only things I could complain about was the hotel restaurant and the wi-fi. We had breakfast once at the restaurant and the servers offered us coffee before we got to see the menu, so unfortunately we didn't know that it was $4 each for coffee because of refills. Had we known that, we would have just got free coffee in the lobby. Wi-fi is expensive, about $10 a day. If you want it for less, you can go to Starbucks to use their internet. Other than that, I have only good things to say about the Kyoto Grand Hotel. Neither of us drive, but it was really easy for us to get around L.A. from the hotel by walking or taking the Metro.

The hotel worked quite well for us for several reasons. First, the hotel has a free shuttle service for destinations relatively nearby, including downtown and to the Medical Center. Second, the hotel is located in the middle of \"Little Tokyo,\" a cluster of Jethnic apanese businesses, including restaurants. Third, the hotel is far enough from what can be an intensely busy neighborhood, the area around the Staple Center, Nokia Center, and Convention Center. Fourth, the hotel is reasonable walking distance to other downtown restaurants and attractions (like the new Disney Concert Hall, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the restored Union Station, and some museums. We found the staff quite friendly and supportive during our stay. The only downside of staying here is that it's possible to get nickel and dimed to death with charges for parking and the internet. Make sure that you have something in writing about these charges before checking in. As to restaurants -- most of the Janpanese restaurants are pretty stodgy and not great. The best one we found was Chin Ma Ya, which is in a three level food court in the building next door to the hotel. Very tasty dishes, much more interesting than the others. There's a noodle shop (cash only, so no receipt to tell you the name) on the south side of 2nd street just west of the hotel that isn't bad. One of the nicest restaurants in the area is Traxx, which is in the concourse of Union Station. We had a great meal there one night, great food, very nice service, reasonable cost. As to breakfast -- there's a Starbucks at ground level adjacent to the back door of the hotel. The hotel advertises their Japanese garden, which is a very nice garden on the roof over the lobby of the hotel. It's open to all guests, and a very nice place to hang out. The downside is that the garden is often used for weddings and other events (mostly weekends), and those uses preempt use by other guests. Another downside is that there's no place to sit down in the garden unless it's set up for an event.

The upper rooms also have spectacular views over Los Angeles. If you're looking at using the conferencing facilities, then read on about my experience: A colleague and I ran a 3-day event at this hotel for 60 people. We picked the hotel because of its location in downtown L.A. and because it had the space we wanted at a good price. On the upside, the conference rooms were well-appointed and furnished, and four of them - their \"Four Seasons\" rooms had sliding doors which allowed quick and efficient changes to size for maximum flexibility, converting it to one, two, three or four rooms as needed. All the rooms we were using were adjacent, allowing people to quickly move from on to another as needed, and all rooms were close to the sleeping rooms - so no great long hikes down endless corridors to get anywhere. The event management staff gave us a great overall rate on a combination of the conference rooms/food and beverage/minimum number of sleep nights booked by attendees. They also gave us a discounted rate for parking. There was good email communication in the 9 months lead up to the event and the staff we dealt with were helpful. On the night before the event, the gave us both access to the rooms and allowed us to set up a registration desk in the lobby area. On the downside, there were a number of problems which left our events running less smoothly than we were comfortable with. Something seemed to happen between what they promised us and what we got. There was an apparent breakdown in communication between the person we were liaising with and the banqueting staff - i.e. the people looking after our conference rooms - which caused a lot of undue stress. On our first day, with one day's notice, we were told we wouldn't be able to use the nearest restrooms as another event had roped the area off. This forced our attendees, including disabled people in wheelchairs, to have to go to facilities on other floors, causing delays in events while we waited for them all to go and get back. The evening of that day, an expensive, specially-made cake for our event (that the hotel had agreed we could bring in) went AWOL after they'd offered to store it for us, never to be seen again. On our second day, we arrived first thing to find the rooms locked and after taking 20 minutes to get someone to open them, they and hadn't been cleaned from the previous day. On our third day, the area outside our rooms was swamped with people for two hours waiting to get into an event in the nearby ballroom - with those guests wandering into our conference rooms until we posted people on the doors to stop them. Throughout our time there, tea and coffee was consistently left outside one of the rooms we were using, rather inside as we requested, so that other random guests kept helping themselves (and at $75 a gallon for coffee, including taxes and service charges, as a not-for-profit organization, we weren't happy about that). Many of the attendees to our event also complained to us about the counter staff being unhelpful and rude, and overall, there was a general lack of organization. We did get a call from the general manager following our feedback. He apologized and told us it won't happen again if we go back there, but didn't offer to reduce the charge on our overall bill or seek in any way to make amends, which left us feeling there was little sincerity behind it. It's a shame because this hotel could be a great all round venue if they could just get their act together.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cYoku dekimashita!

So we thought we'd play tourist in Los Angeles...one of the most culturally diverse cities in the country. After reading reviews and looking at the best rated hotels on TA, some had their pluses and minuses. I found the Kyoto on discoverLosAngeles.com, and then read some of the reviews on TA. The pictures on their website reminded me of the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco. I did want to travel to Japan this summer, but staying in Japantown would have to suffice. Their website had a summer special, $199 per night included self-parking, WiFi, buffet breakfast, and chilled sake in the evening, delivered to your room (we only did this one night because we forgot). After looking at several other properties in the area, this was by far the best deal. I booked the room through their website and received a confirmation via e-mail. I wrote back and wanted to make sure they had my requests for a higher floor and a room away from the elevators and ice machine. Everything at check-in was in order. The young woman who checked us in was professional and friendly. She gave us a map of the area, and when she forgot to give us the breakfast coupons, she flagged us down when we returned to the hotel later that evening after coming back from the Griffith Observatory. She also recommended a Japanese restaurant, Fuga, which turned out to be a great find! I'm sorry to say I didn't get her name. She is a great asset to the hotel. We ate breakfast every morning and the staff was wonderful. The restaurant also serves Starbucks coffee which not only gets you going, but tastes great too. I can understand why at times, the Pangea Garden is closed for events. It's beautiful, serene, and peaceful. We saw two weddings from our room on the 14th floor. My only regret is not taking more pictures of it. Our room was a good size with two double beds, flat screen t.v., and a small refrigerator which was a nice surprise. I could sleep in that bed all day..it was very comfortable. If I had any concerns, I'd say the bathroom was a little small and there were a few minor little upkeep things, but nothing major to complain about. After reading some of the other negative reviews, I tend to question their veracity. I never book through third parties because you get what THEY give you and there's no compromise with the hotel because you didn't book the room through the hotel. You are just looking for a cheap place to stay and you get what you get. The hotel is location is fine. We walked around at 10 pm and it reminded us a little like San Francisco. Every staff member we spoke to was professional and cordial. The front desk is efficient. It's the customers that make their jobs difficult. When I checked out, I stood in line for about 10 minutes, but all it took was 2 minutes for me to review my bill, say how much I liked their property, and went on my way.

Pros: - great downtown location for Little Tokyo, Garment District - Clean room - Big TV Cons - Noise from below - Weak shower head - expensive parking", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cA lot of small things really do add up...\u201d", "Author": "esims04", "ReviewID": "UR110779769", "Content": "We decided to stay at the Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens because it was different from most hotels in the area. The hotel lobby and bar was pleasant and elegant but looked a bit run down and dated. We asked to be upgraded to a suite, the first thing they said was \"we do not recommend the suites\" a very interesting statement since most hotels would love for all guest to upgrade and pay more. They claimed their suites were not renovated but we did not mind. The first suite had two queen beds so we switched into a \"Japanese \"style suite, and it was literally a Japanese style, there was no bed and you had to make it and sleep on the floor. We are typical Americans and just wanted a bed big and flat screen to relax in. The third room was the room I booked online called the Deluxe King Room. It was very nice and updated. We were the second room from the elevator, and we were able to hear the elevator go up and down. This was not extremely loud, but enough to notice. We brushed it off and decided to order room service. To our surprise there FEES for just ordering room service! About 15 dollars in fees when we could of just went down stairs and ate; there was no indication about the fees on the menu for room service. We decided to let it go and the next day to eat breakfast and check out. We had booked the Penny Sale which included free Wi-Fi, free breakfast and free parking. Well, when we went to breakfast the waiter told us we needed vouchers. So not a problem, went to the front desk to get the voucher and came back. The waiter then said, you need two vouchers for the both of you. I was a littler irradiated since I book the room for two people but the waiter was kind enough to call the front desk and fix it. After breakfast we go to check out, our bill had two charged of internet and somehow\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6our room rate went up from the time I booked it! I look at the front desk lady and say \"Internet it free with the deal, please fix it\" she fixes it, brings me back to look at it, only one of the charges are gone. I tell her again \"There is still a charge for internet, please fix it.\" She apologizes and fixes it again. The last time I look at the bill my room rate which I booked at $147 went up to $160. I said this is not the rate I booked and thank God I had my reservation printed out from when I booked it. It clearly said $147. She said \"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weird\" and fixed it for me. All these little things do add up and made the experience annoying and unpleasant.

For us, this is not an issue because Trade Show Organizers planned for this well and arranged Tour Bus Fleet to provide dense service at 8 minute intervals of 1/3 full busses for comfort + commuting!! For LA, the closest hotels were 5 large blocks away from the convention center, so staying close by is not as beneficial for off site private meetings as other trade show venues where the hotels are across the street. The decision to stay at Kyoto Grand came mainly from positive reviews below on this site. We were not dissappointed. If you enjoy Japanese cuisine and service then this is refreshing as there are dozen or more superior Japanese restaraunts on par with best in any US cities. Ok, that is enough for the area. The hotel review, offers very good value at $175 per nite. In room breakfast choice at $20 with gratuity is excellent, compared to $42 with exactly same food a month prior in San Francisco's W Hotel across street from Moscone Center and local SF breakfast at diner of $27.00 + tip. Was delivered on time. Funny though, we had to phone each day to request the door hanging order form. You would think Housekeeping would put fresh ones in the room daily, but I have noted this from most hotels I stay in so this must be some trendy cost saving tip amongst hoteliers? I stayed on 9th floor. Decor was tired and old, but not peeling or faded and everything worked well. The bedding was new. Linens were Crisp, clean and as comfortable as any Sweet Sleeper upper scale bed. Slept great but that also could have been the Sake and long days. Towels were large and very fluffy. Everything was very clean, very! Gardens in the back of the hotel were actually refreshing to look at in the morning against the city scape and made me wonder, \"who would engineer that these days with real estate costs being so high?\", so this is pleasant bonus and helps put you in a nice, calm state. This is well maintained by the hotel as it should be and is a nice esthetic. I am a gardener so this was a bonus. I would recommend Garden View rooms over city view. The TV was older tube style, but I only watched it briefly, but it makes the decor appear older and not updated. Small change of this would update the room. Hotel's Ibahn wireless service in the room worked perfectly and having cost waved ($9.95) as part of conference booking package was great! Again, barely used it to upload and download few messages so it would have been painful if we had to pay each day. Lobby bar was well provisioned but underwhelming. OK for meeting or quick drink only. I would not choose to invest more time there than this. A dozen Japanese bars compliment Japanese restaraunts nearby. The hotel staff is terrific, from whoever answers the phone, the front desk, door men, bell captains, housekeepers, room service and kitchen staff were terrific! We did not use the hotel restaraunt as I suspect few do, epecially after reading the reviews here. I looked in and it was closed. At best, it did look subdued. If I owned this property, I would re design coffee shop to reflect higher energy and up beat Japanese style, Tokyo contemporary coffee shop with pastries for tea anytime and 18 hour operation for breakfast 6:00 AM to Midnite for Asian, European and East Coast North American travelers. I did notice from ther bus there is a Starbucks in the hotel, but never visited it. I did not visit the health club, but you probably figured that since this review focus is on sleep, drink and food. The showers worked great. Terrific water pressure. In Japan however, I am always amazed at the terrific tubs and showers. These, though very functional in terms of U.S. standards would be considered sub standard in Japan, only and I suppose a bath make over would be too costly. Safes are provided at no charge but this hotel is very secure. There are well dressed, polite and competent security people in the hotel and present. We felt secure and safe. I like a safe so I can leave my laptop in the room. I did not see one and called the front desk and within minutes, they brought one up and I was in business. The service in this hotel is excellent. Finally, we were leaving as the Tsunami hit Japan and saw the saw and felt the deep concern of many guests from Japan and the local shops. Our thoughts and prayers go out to our friends in Japan! Summary: none of the updates I suggest, the decor or bath fixtures or even coffee shop update would make my stay any better and the lack of these 'updates' are subjective and did not make my stay any worse at all.

I've stayed there one or two weeks a year every year since maybe 2005, since it was the New Otani (old name). My take is that the price is very reasonable for downtown (generally @$135/night). This is very important- they have rooms which have been renovated with black wood furniture and new bedding (very comfortable) with large Sharp LCD Tvs but you need to ask for it specifically. The front desk told me they don't charge more, it's just based on availability and upon request. I've had one every time. The only issue I have with these rooms is the bathroom- yes they are pretty small, but more annoying to me is the vanity/sink. I'm tall so any hotels with older lower sinks are annoyance when shaving and such. Newer hotels generally have counter height sinks which are much nicer. But that's my only issue with the room. Room service is terrific, it's a bit overpriced (only because of the service charge) but is tasty and I don't think it's ever taken more than 15-20 mins from order to delivery. Staff is very friendly. They have 24 hour maintenance staff and they were able to quickly accommodate my request to make my room's AC very cold despite it being cold outside and 2am at the time. Another important tidbit is that there is a free shuttle which will take you (and come get you) most places downtown. I've been taking cabs everywhere and never even knew that til this trip. Ramon at the bell desk clued me in on it and was awesome, even took me to an ATM for my bank to save me bank fees at just any ATM. Lastly they are probably being bought by Doubletree soon which is all the better since I am a Hilton Diamond member, and earning points would make this hotel all the better.

I made the choice to stay at this hotel because it was the only downtown LA hotel left with a vacancy at the time that I booked, which was several weeks in advance. I knew what to expect after the reviews, but wanted to remain optimistic and open minded. My friends and I were placed in a room that is advertised as a \"renovated\" room on their website. So the rooms shown in the website photos do in fact exist. Although now, I am wondering what year those photos were taken! The first thing that I noticed when I entered the room was that (as prior reviews stated) the air conditioning did not work. It was basically the fan running. Needless to say, the room temp was about 75 degrees when we arrived mid afternoon and at least 85 when we woke the next morning. We had the wall unit turned down to 60!!! I cannot imagine what these rooms are like when the outside temperatures are even higher. I do have a couple of positive things to say. I was pleased with the customer service. I called a couple of times prior to my stay because I knew the hotel was sold out. I wanted to be sure that there was not a problem with my reservation and I wanted to be first in line to check in.. just in case the hotel overbooked. I spoke with several different people and each person was extremely nice and accomodating. Also, my friends and I came in at 2:00 a.m. and needed to find a restaurant still serving food. The staff immediately recommended a Japanese restaurant a couple blocks away that was still open and the food was excellent!! Another positive that I can add is the shower in the bathroom. The bathrooms in the hotel have not been updated and still have the old 70's pink tile and fixtures. Also, there was no fan to absorb the moisture. With that being said, the shower in our room worked great! The water pressure was 11 on a scale of 10 and we were on the 4th floor! The water was also hot, just how I like it. The shower head was a hand held and also had a tall placement post that worked perfect for a tall person as myself. I didn't have to break my neck trying to wash my hair.

The bed (we upgraded to the pillowtop king room) was EXTREMELY comfortable. The shower had great water pressure. The room was quiet (it was a street side room not over the garden). We never heard people beside us, over, or under us. Their conceirege was always in the lobby walking around and very accessible. Anytime we were in the lobby looking lost, he would walk up and offer friendly help and advice. The only slight negative (and the hotel staff can't do anything to fix it) is the location. Its not the best, not the worst. The only big tourist stuff it's close too is olvera st., union station, chinatown, and little tokyo (of course).

The elevator takes you straight into the hotel where it has an enormous lobby area decorated with japanese paintings and other exotic decor, which made us go \"WOW!\" Now this is the reason why im rating this a 4 instead of a 5. i booked the \"Deluxe\" room with a king bed directly on the Kyoto Grand website. As pictured on the site, the deluxe room is the remolded room thats decorated in dark brown colors and specifically a 42'' flat screen tv, this is the room i booked. After checking in, we proceeded up to the room only to find that its one of the \"old\" rooms thats labled as the \"standard\" room on the website. The standard rooms are decorated in very light colors with a 25'' or so tv, very different from the deluxe rooms. So i went back down to the front desk and told them the situation, Maria at the front desk double checked my reservation on the system and she said that that room is whati booked! now the standard room rate was about $98 and the deluxe room was about $117, i did not pay the extra money to get one of those old standard rooms! (you can verify the differences between the two on the kyoto grand website when you get to the reservations page w/ the rooms/rates, there are specific and obvious differences between the standard and deluxe rooms even in the description)But Maria was nice enough (given the fact taht it wasnt really busy) gave me the upgrade to the deluxe remodeled room. The deluxe remodeled rooms are amazing and breathtaking! the huge 42'' tv kept us from being bored, the decor was very warm and relaxing, everything about the room was A++++++. So all in, the rooms, service, location were picture perfect except for the EXTREMELY MISLEADING room descriptions on the website. i hope the management reads this review to prevent this from happening again.

The real problem in this hotel is service. People who are supposed to provide service in this hotel are clueless. Local TV stations were not coming in -- but in 5 days, no one in this hotel could get the cable company to fix what was wrong. My radio was broken -- it took two calls, the second, very insistent, to get it fixed. Someone else's charges were charged to my room -- it took more time to straighten this out than it should have. There was no concierge available during the 6 days of my stay -- only the desk clerks, usually only one per shift. When I arrived, there was no bellhop -- I had to bring my suitcases up to my room unassisted. There simply weren't enough people working in the hotel, and the ones who were there could stand re-training. Neighborhood was very safe during day; I never walked around unaccompanied at night. Lots of Japanese and other restaurants nearby, and yogurt places (Yogurt Land at San Pedro and First is even better than Pinkberry.) Also markets and interesting shops. Location is walking distance to Walt Disney Concert Hall (excellent docent-let tours of all 4 theaters are available,) museums and the Cathedral.

The check in was unbelievably quick before I knew it I was headed towards my room. I got a very clean king deluxe room. The colors of the furniture was neutral colors which was nice. The bed was a little on the hard side but it was sleepable. The view from my room faced lots of high sky rises. And the view below was the beautiful view of the Japanese garden that is located on the property. I loved how peaceful the hotel was, I hardly seen anybody around except for the staff. And I thought maybe this is a well kept secret of a wonderful hotel. A must see on the 3rd floor of this hotel is the Japanese Garden as I strolled thru this beautiful garden I felt my stress just fade away completely. I could tell they really kepted up with the gardening and the water looked so clean. The thing I didn't agree on and shouldn't be charged to the hotel guest. Was the charges for parking which was $24.00 a day, which was charged on my bill automatically when I checked in. But I also realized that everywhere in that area and in downtown L.A, parking was charged. The thing that I didn't care for was that from the parking garage I had to walk thru the lobby and past the front desk clerks to get to the elevators to get to my room. But thats my opinion as for my partner she felt safer knowing the front desk clerks can watch whos coming in and out of the hotel. So thats a neigh and a yeah on that subject. The area is a great location to go to every popular attraction in Hollywood and Los Angeles. For restaurants yes there is a couple in the hotel but pricey. And the hotel connects to a mall with restaurants also. But around this area for fast foods restaurants thats open 24 hours its not close by its a quite a bit of a drive. Or in matter of fact any fast food restaurants, there isn't any close by. As for the staff they were very friendly and always greeted me with a hello as I passed by them.

Staff members were *more* than polite and kind. Truly, I did not run into *one* staff member who was nothing less than warm and accommodating. The room was standard hotel fare -- neutral and calm decor. The fridge was a welcome feature for snacks and drinks. Yes, the beds were very firm, but I slept well.

The Kyoto Grand, while hardly grand, fit that bill--I got a rate of $107. The hotel is located in (really at the edge of) Little Tokyo, probably the liveliest area of Downtown LA--one that has restaurants and stores open in the evening. At the same time it's only a few blocks from Union Station and from the Downtown core. It's a good location for a car-free traveler, which I was on this trip. It's near the Red Line subway, the Gold Line light rail, and numerous Metro and DASH buses. The hotel's location and its height are its best assets in my view. Asking for a high floor, I was given a 10th floor room, which had an unobstructed view facing south (other directions taller buildings might have blocked it). The room was acceptable, arguably \"Japanese\" abstract art on the walls. The bed was comfortable enough and there was good natural light in the daytime and darkness at night. I didn't have any noise problems. There was a decent radio--something you don't always get. As people said the bathroom is small--particularly annoying was a short bathtub with what felt like a sharp edge at the back when I tried to stretch out in it. The bathtub seemed chintzy next to a fairly generous room. Hotels should have adequate length bathtubs or none at all. I didn't try the hotel's restaurants--I went to Weller Court--a 3 story shopping court with multiple restaurants which was literally the next building over.

It seems that this hotel is more worried about getting you in the door at a reasonable room rate so they can nickel and dime you into getting a second job not unlike Home depot.

In that regard, I feel that it was a good deal, based on the $127/night price I got through Orbitz. I would be very disappointed ath the regular price of $190 to $200/night.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cRooms were noisy and area was ghetto\u201d", "Author": "grayrockravens", "ReviewID": "UR18156758", "Content": "Was in Los Angeles on vacation with my family of four and found this hotel (back then it was New Otani) for a reasonable $150/night. The room was rather cramped with 2 double beds, and the walls were thin. The worst part was that because of its downtown location, there were many helicopters flying around that made it hard for me to sleep. The tea garden sounds nice, but in reality is rather small and not exactly a long romantic stroll. Not much in the area, and so like much of LA, you'll need a car to get around. The Staples Center and Koreatown are only a 5 minute drive away, and there's a small Japanese plaza with a couple restaurants and shops within walking distance. I would not recommend unless you got it really cheap.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice with Convenient Location\u201d", "Author": "Charmqueen", "ReviewID": "UR18086511", "Content": "Very nice and clean room.

The room was what I expected for a 3-star hotel: perfectly adequate, nothing to go wild over. At registration the desk clerk handed me a cup of iced tea and a warm towel while I was signing in--a nice touch, and a sign of the thoughtful service that was to mark my stay throughout. The lobby's great, and the third-floor garden is a haven. The restaurant A Thousand Cranes is worth checking out. It's pricey, but the Sunday buffet is one of the best meals (and high-end bargains!) I've had in Los Angeles. The location, with a bail bond place practically next door, may be off-putting, but that's because a city detention center is nearby, as is City Hall. Thanks to one or two restaurants open as late as 3 a.m. I've wandered the streets in the area late at night without incident for more than 25 years. If you use public transit, there are many bus lines that go past it. The Civic Center Metro stop is a third of a mile away, and Union Station is just over half a mile away.

I looked for a hotel near the Metro station and Art Museum I was attending within walking distance. This place was a gem. Three blocks from the Metro station and two blocks from the Japanese American National Museum, right in the heart of LA's Little Tokyo. Formerly the New Otani Hotel, (It still has an Asian/Japanese theme) they have about a 20 story tower complete with everything you need. A lobby bar which also serves food, the weekend bartender Roberto G. makes the best mojito you could ever have and also is so personable he shold have a tv show.. Also a lobby level restaurant (Azealia) for mainly american food. A couple floors up are the main eateries, a fine food venue with a sushi and shashimi area, a place with a lot of beef and asian inspired influences and a mainly nighttime bar with every drink you want, including every type of sake, as well as food items. Hours vary depending on the day but there's always something, including room service if it's that late. Plus you're in the heart of little Tokyo. Yeah it might not feel great at 10 or 11 at night but it's safe! And there's a ton of other places to eat as well as the in-house Starbuck's, but they close early. For the hotel itself, easy and quick check-in and out, very competent staff, I never had a problem go unanswered. The room, I had a basic room, was everything you could expect, windows that open, variable A/C, bathroom toiletries, the tv even includes a few HBO channels. My favorite feature was the authentic Japanese Garden, located on a terrace on the third floor, it is a several acre oasis garden of foliage, streams and a waterfall. In one corner there is a full bar and grill where you can walk-up or order food to your table. Grilled ribs and a cool drink while admiring the LA skyline in the middle of a Japanese Garden, how cool! The hotel's staff was always there, not only for security but to make sure you had no problems.

Now with the negatives--The lobby was beautiful as stated before, so it was a complete shock to find a room that had a stale smell with carpets that were stained all over and the beds were not comfortable. There was a large group (25+) of 18-21 year olds staying there on Saturday night who were extremely rude and beligerant; I felt unsafe with them around, but the staff seemed unconcerned about the profanity there were loudly speaking throughout the lobby and garage. I was traveling with my 15 y.o. niece on a road trip from San Jose area, and we ended up leaving a day early even though I had prepaid for the night. The front desk staff were indifferent as to why we were leaving a day early.

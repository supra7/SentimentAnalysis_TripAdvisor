The rooms are nice...some have been better than others, but that's like any other hotel. The beds are comfortable, room size is average but perfect for us as we don't spend much time in the room, and the bathroom is sufficient for two. The complimentary breakfast is always good and the dining area is clean. There are two nearby restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The Thai Orchid is a good choice if you like Thai food, and Charleston's is a nice casual restaurant with a varied menu. The front desk staff of the Hampton will give you free coupons for Charlestons if you ask them. We have never used the pool, but it's indoor and doesn't ever seem to be very busy.

Several issues add up to detract from my stay at this property. Constantly blinking message light on phone, but there were no messages. #3 on the phone did not work, so I could not call 2 different numbers that contained the #3. Reported the phone issues 3 times with no resolution. The unreliable phone concerned me about my wake up call on 11 Aug, but it arrived as scheduled. Prior to checking out, I was grossed out by a large stain on the mattress sheet. Not to be graphic, but it was a stain one might see in a honeymoon suite\u2014no, I did not cause the stain. Did not notice the night before because I just crawled under the covers, but I did notice the obvious cigarette burn hole in the bed cover. This was a non-smoking room, but there was a stale smell of cigarette smoke. There are 3 entrances into the hotel. Of course, the one most convenient to my room was out of order, so I had to take a longer walk to access my room. There is a major railroad crossing adjacent to the hotel. Could hear passing trains at least 6 times in 2 days. A special train passes thru this crossing 17 times a day 6 to 22 Aug, so that may have been the train I heard. Nice LCD TV with good variety of stations. Free WiFi is secured with an access code. It was stable, but slow. Had to use Skype because my room\u2019s phone did not work, but Skype barely worked because of the slow connections. There is only one accessible electrical outlet built into a desk / workspace. Limited the options when using my laptop or to even plug in an iron. Large breakfast served in the lobby, and there are a couple of computers with printer in the lobby\u2019s front corner.

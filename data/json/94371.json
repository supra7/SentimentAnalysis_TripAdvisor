The best part of the hotel is the location, and that's not really a huge advantage considering that there are number of great hotels that are within 1-2 blocks of this hotel. The room itself was nice, looks like it has been recently renovated. But there are lots of strange little things in the room that keep this a good/average hotel. For example the bathroom is small and the doors open from the middle and don't close completely -- they have a 1/2 inch slit in the middle of them that is just awkward. The blinds were strangely difficult to close in our room which was annoying. We had a minibar in our room, but were not given the key to it (had to ask for that separately). And my wake-up call was about 15 minutes late the first day; again not a huge deal, but an example of average, not great, service. One thing I did like about the room is that there's a button on the inside that you can push and a \"do not disturb\" light will show outside the room.

For some reason I didn't expect that the prices would rival staying in Manhattan and at the same time, the number of hotels seemed limited. Thanks to a tripadvisor and a decent amount of research time, I had a terrific stay at The Colonnade Hotel in October, regardless of the freak snowstorm that blew through the city during our 4-day/3-night stay. We were celebrating my travel partner's birthday and the hotel kindly accommodated my request for a high floor and quiet room, and even left a lovely note with cheese and fruit platter for us on the first night. It was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate that the general manager took the time to acknowledge the special occasion. The King Luxe Room is a good size, very cleanly decorated with modern furnishings (think boutique hotel) and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The thin sliding door to the bathroom isn't ideal but the bathroom itself is very clean and the Thymes amenities are of good quality. There's even a yellow rubber ducky waiting for you on the bathtub ledge. The location is very convenient with a T (subway) station directly out front, which we used everyday as it was very easy to explore the city by subway and bus. The Fenway Park tour and visit to Harvard were highlights, along with great meals at Toro (tapas), Union Bar & Grill (brunch), Neptune Oyster and Oleana (Eastern Mediterranean).

The receptionist was very polite and said it was only for their record.

Especially because we were travelling with three toddlers, and when a hotel can cater to us and impress, it definitely makes mom and dad's job easier! We stayed here for 5 days in October, and had two adjoining rooms. My husband had a conference just up the street at the huge Marriott.That place is a zoo, and it takes 10 minutes just to wait for an elevator. I'm so glad we chose the Colonnade! Service was excellent. Service with a smile. Front desk staff was courteous and helpful. I'm blanking on the bellhop, but I think his name was Danny, the older gentleman who's been there for several years. Very knowledgeable & friendly, and he and the other bellhops were always happy to greet my children and carry our bags. In the room, the kids cribs were standard cribs, but decent, not pack n plays, which is often the case. And they brought us several rubber ducks for the kids. Everyone also enjoyed the floor to ceiling glass windows that lined the room. Wow!! Kids loved watching the people, buses, firetrucks, etc...and because of that, I would recommend getting a higher-floor room which will be quieter. There are black-out shades, so no worries about sunlight and all those windows. Rooms were clean, modern, nicely-sized (not huge, but not cramped either), beds were incredibly comfortable, nice sheets, etc. The bathroom was a little small, but it was clean and new, so that wasn't a problem for us. (but if you need a large bathroom, you may want to look elsewhere) Housekeeping was very efficient, and they were friendly, always happy to greet my family, ask if they could help, etc. The only negative that I found was that the hallways are dark. If I had vision problems, or perhaps if I was an elderly guest, I might have trouble finding my room or finding my way to the elevator! I think they should raise the lighting in the halls, but other than that, I can't find fault w/the hotel. Fitness facility was good, variety of cardio and weights. Clean, well ventilated. (according to the husband, I did not use this time) We had breakfast one morning at the brasserie, and it was very good, tasty, but service was a little slow. Lots of fresh choices on the menu, and that place usually looked busy, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again, and just hope for more efficient service next time. Location is excellent, but again it just depends on your travel plans. We were in town for a conference.There are probably equally nice hotels in more touristy areas, or perhaps if we were there for Head of the Charles, for example, I might stay somewhere else. Tip for families w/small children--there's a great playground just down the street, around the corner and down a few blocks, by a church. Also, you're across from the Prudential Center (shopping), Shaw's supermarket, Cheesecake Factory, and plenty of other stores & restaurants. Also, you're a short walk to Boylston, Newbury, The Back Bay, etc. (also across the street for Duck Tours, for those inclined to do that!!) We really enjoyed our stay, and we will certainly stay here again without hesitation.

We parked conveniently right in the hotel building which is not always the case in Boston. We were checked in courteously and efficiently by a desk clerk who treated us as though we were weekly guests. As we opened our guestroom door, we were met by a friendly woman who had just turned down our bed. She did her best to refuse the tip I eventually had to force on her. Our room was spotless. I know this hotel has been around for many years, but the decor was current, trendy and fun. The sound machine playing seagulls was our first hint that all necessary technology was in place. Sound dock, oversized flatscreen with plenty of channel options and DVD player. There was an in-room safe to protect my laptop. Lighting was high tech and totally functional from places to read to places to shave. The bathroom fixtures, mirror, make-up mirrors and soap products smacked of first-class boutique. The shower provided welcome serious force. It was impossible to find fault with any of the facilities, but even more impressive was the hotel staff. Our check-in was warm and flawless. There was an extraordinary presence of managers and employees in the lobby everytime we passed. Concierges were a centerpiece. Doormen and bellmen were visibly active and soliciting opportunities to help. My wife even struck up a lengthy conversation with a plain clothes security guard. We appreciate the security they provide. This guy added unexpected touches of personality and hospitality. We enjoyed very professional service at Brasserie Jo, the hotel restaurant, for breakfast. I'm not just talking the server, but the busboy whose duties apparently included serving water and coffee. The menu was French and fun.

I did my homework on Trip Advisor and found this hotel more highly rated than several well-known flags and at a far more reasonable price. However no place is inexpensive in Boston! We were not disappointed with the Colonnade. Our room was ready when we arrived early and check-in was fast and easy. Our room was ample size, modern, attractive, clean and comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows let us enjoy the view. We used the concierge service and they were very helpful. They recommended the Old Town Trolley for our initial tour of the city (more expensive than the competition but more frequent service and it stops right in front of the hotel). They also familiarized us with the subway (MBTA) with an entrance to the Prudential (Green Line) stop right outside the door of the hotel. Don't hesitate to take the subway to get around! Several times we dined and stopped-in for drinks at the hotel's Brasserie Jo. Excellent food and service. The bartenders were friendly and freely gave us their sightseeing recommendations. The highly rated Atlantic Fish Company is just a short walk from the hotel. Please make a reservation or you will have to dine either very early or vary late. Two places to visit while walking in the immediate area are the Boston Public Library (beautiful interior courtyard) and Trinity Church Boston (American Institute of Architects - Top 10 most significant buildings in the country).

That said, I just had to let everyone know how wonderful this hotel is. I can not say enough about my 4 day stay this week at the Colonnade Hotel. My company chose the Colonnade as the site for this years conference. Having stayed in the 4 walls of the hotel for the majority of my stay, except for a dinner cruise night, I can honestly say that for the entire 4 days of my stay, they completely wowed me. Right from the start, I had a pleasant experience at the front desk. They were friendly and helpful, offering area maps and suggestions on where to go and what to do. I declined because I am a Bostonian but it was still nice that they are helping out-of-towners to get out and see our beautiful city. Right away I was pleased with the appearance of the room. Clean, modern, inviting. My view was of the south end, not the city view. It didn't matter. My view was amazing both in the daylight and at night. I started by ordering room service since I was in for a long night of work. The menu was excellent, the staff was courteous both over the phone and upon delivery of my meal. I am always nervous about the quality of food in any hotel, especially room service. The food is all prepared from the downstairs restaurant, Brasserie Jo's. It was wonderful. I ordered the steak and asked for salad in replacement of the fries. The steak was delicious and the salad was huge and excellent as well. It came with a warm loaf of bread. The cappucino was also great. Over the course of the week, we were served breakfast, multiple snacks, lunch and dinner. Everything was perfect: presentation, fun and different snack ideas (ie. Hot pretzels w/ mustard and Fenway Park ice cream bars to name a few), lunches and dinners that were high quality and well prepared and presented. I have been to quite a few conferences and even more hotel weddings...never have I come across this kind of food. Needless to say I ate A LOT this week. Moving on to the service: I did not encounter one person who was not smiling at me, asking me how I was, asking if they could get me anything, etc. Such a wonderful and amazing staff. Hotel management should feel extremely proud that they have such a wonderful team interacting with their guests. The location: Again being a Bostonian, I did not need to sneak out during downtime to explore but if I had, and others did, there is tons of shopping, eating and even the Duck Tour, right outside the front door. Now for the pillows: Oh the pillows! The bed as a whole was fabulous with soft sheets and a comfortable mattress but the pillows had me at hello. I think the best way to explain them is heaven right here in little ole Boston! Several others could not stop talking about them as well. I found myself hitting snooze in the morning and day dreaming of them all day. I know it sounds totally silly, but you wouldn't understand unless you tried them. Great choice Colonnade! One last thing: They did not spare one detail. I never use any products from hotels but I did here. Their shampoos and soaps are wonderful and a great size. Then the rubber duckie. CUTE! Nice touch, Colonnade! It made me smile and I took it with me as a reminder of my wonderful time in your hotel.

I am finishing a 3 week stretch at the hotel. I have had a lot of time to learn about the place... First the strengths: 1) The rooms are uniformly excellent. The furniture, style and comfort are super. The bathrooms are modern, bright and clean. The linens and room maintenance are excellent. Rooms are bright, windows fill one entire floor to ceiling wall. There is a big TV, and nice Keurig coffee machine. 2) The gym is smallish, but well equipped. 3) The Brasserie on the first floor is fantastic. Truly super French food, in a beautiful art deco style. The service is super, the waiters and bartenders top-notch. The food is heavy, the wine French: many a nice night spent here. 3) Location is great. You are directly next to the Green Line E Train, and easy connections to the city. Lots of nearby shopping. Now, the room for improvement: While it aspires to be a luxury option, service is what prevents it from approaching the true luxury leagues. The major barrier is a lack of attention to detail. For a small independent hotel, customer relationships are sub-optimal. Despite spending 40 nights a year here, no staff member has ever addressed me by name, or even appeared to recognize me. Along this vein, CRM is not optimized at all. If I spent 40 nights at the Sheraton across the street, I would be recognized with a preferred status, or an upgrade, etc. In a small hotel, it might be a note from the manager, or a fruit plate. Here- in the middle ground, it's awfully anonymous. Next, service can be very spotty. The staff are very pleasant when you approach them with an issue (in my case a broken toilet). But followthrough is generally poor: days to get a repair with no updates, little attention to the problem, etc. A call for housekeeping supplies was forgotten. Followthrough is the problem time and time again. This seems to hold for room service who can deliver on time, but who seem to pick up plates from the hall once a day. There seem to always be dishes in the corridors (and a perpetual food odor in the halls). At any rate, will I continue to stay here? Probably (although the Copley Square is another nearly, recently renovated, fine choice). The rate/reward ratio is good, assuming you get a good rate. I like the room and the location. For most guests, the Colonnade is an fine choice for a short stay. But is the Colonnade what it could be? Not quite. I'm not sure what the obstacle is: disempowered staff ...absent management?

Colonnade was the only hotel to jump on this lead. Omni, Hilton, and disappointingly the Copley Square boutique hotel did not. I preferred the large room/small bathrooms floorplan of the Colonnade over the Copely Square small room/large bathroom floorplan. Like the Copley Square, the Colonnade had a recent facelift, albeit not as chic. The best feature is the new bathroom door configuration. It slides, which makes the usual cramped room entry with 3 doors (closet+bath+hallway) much more workable. Unfortunately, our first room had major bathroom issues. The remodeling was not done well, so that the tub was separating from the marble walls and the marble floor was caving at the rear of the tub. I did not notice this until my morning shower, when I stepped to the rear of tub and it flexed like a water mattress. My second room had no issues, and the change was done to minimize the hassle to me. As an aside, such oversight is not unique to The Colonnade. I have found in recent travel years that knowledge of the condition of a room needing attention (major/construction or mechanical, significant/mold or minor/burned-out bulbs, unplugged clocks) is not adequately shared among cleaning crew and management. Surprisingly, when I leave a written note concerning significant or minor deficiences for the crew, so as to prevent any trouble, the requested fix is usually ignored. About 25% of my stays require me, as a customer, alerting the front desk. The Copley Square was not without issues. Although its restaurant served the kind of food I eat most often (noveau healthy cuisine), Its bar attracts quite an evening crowd. When it empties, the noise on street woke me every night. Jo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brassiere, the restaurant attached to the Colonnade, served authentic french countryside comfort food dishes, which is what I prefer over high presentation and over sauced dishes. I wish that the French inflections of the servers could be dropped, whenever they are not authentic. The only staple that needs improving is the baguette. It is flavorless\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlikely due to a quick rise process. It would be better if they served demi-baguettes with more flavor. As a solo diner, I was still given a good table. My vegetarian/pescatarian daughter found foods to eat, when we ate together, as we often order several small dishes to share.

(and being able to sit on a real table- with a view-, with real chairs... not the ordinary tiny computer desk cluttered with the yellow pages and disposable paper cups!) Lobster and delicious Chowda is just across the street! We were there on Independence Day and street was pretty busy that night. We found out that extra staff was on duty to screen people willing to get access to rooms. A good point for the residents safety! We had our breakfasts at Jo Brasserie. It's reasonably priced, with a top notch service. On the negative side, internet is not free and becomes very pricey if you intend to use it everyday. Same comment for the parking. At $38 per day, it's not a bargain, but offers in and out privilege, and has direct convenient access to the lobby and rooms. We are experienced world travellers and have been staying in all kind of hotels, from cheap Inns to pricier Westin's ,Shangri-La's, Hyatt's and so... Staying at the Colonnade is probably one of our best experience, and one of the greatest value for our bucks.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLocation!

Red (Gray Line Tour) trolley stop is a block away at the Sheraton. We walked to Fenway and Northeastern. About 10 min taxi ride to Fanueil Hall or Aquarium. Plenty of food options within a block or 2. Cheesecake Factory, 5 Napkin Burger, California Pizza Kitchen, Cold Stone right across the street on street level. Food court with lots of quick options in Prudential Center across the street. Pizzeria Uno a block away. 7-11 a block away was very handy for water/snack stop. We had heard that street rooms were noisy but did not find this to be the case. You can hear when emergency vehicles go by with their sirens during the night but it happened maybe twice.

The brasserie also has a lovely cocktail bar. The location is excellent - there is a metro stop right outside the hotel taking you downtown within a few stops.

After our complaining, without any apologize she finally gave us a king size bed and say to us booking through the internet can never guarantee anything.

We did not take anything out from the mini bar so we call to the front desk ask them to removed the charge. Front desk told us all the charge has been removed. When I come back, my credit card has been charge another 4.75 dollars. So I have to call again to the hotel to ask them to remove.

The 2nd slight negative, and this is only for people with children, is to warn about the windows. We were on the 5 th floor and the windows fully opened, pretty scary for those with children. The biggest negative for me was the lack of free Wi-Fi in the rooms, there is free wi fi in the lobby but you have to pay for internet access in the rooms, pretty poor considering most hotels offer this as standard now.

When making my reservation, I informed the hotel in passing that my stay was a special occasion. Upon checking into what was supposed to be a standard King room, I found I had been given a complimentary upgrade to what is, hands down, the nicest and most spacious suite I have ever stayed in. The decor is understated and modern, with touches of warmth throughout. The bathroom is large enough to get lost in. The bed is impossibly large and comfortable. Did I mention the two enormous flat-screen TVs? The floor-to-ceiling city views? I have traveled extensively and stayed everywhere from the Ritz to a Motel 6-- and thus far, the Colonnade has been the most grand, considerate, creative and lovely hotel I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Within minutes of my settling down into one of the gorgeous, plush sofas in my suite's living room, the doorbell rang: behind it was a room service waiter with a complimentary cheese&fruit plate and a kind note from the General Manager, wishing me well on my special day.

This room shared a wall with the fitness center - you could hear the hum of treadmills by 6:30 am - this was a minor inconvenience but important if you are a light sleeper or late sleeper. This room was also set up as a possible adjoining room which meant we could hear EVERYTHING coming the next room from TV programs to a heated business conference call at 7AM one morning.

Positives were the staff - very helpful and I'm pretty sure if we had complained about the room, they would have tried to move us but we were settled in by day 3.

Airport to the Colonnade Hotel lasted about ten minutes at 2.30am, and the taxi fare was a very reasonable $26 (excluding tip). The Colonnade Hotel has excellent access to the 'T' (metro service) with the Prudential stop (on the green line) directly outside the front door. A single fare to the airport costs just $1.70 and involves three hassle free changes (green line, blue line and airport shuttle bus). Situated in a great location, the hotel is conveniently close to two up-market malls, Newbury Street (boutique shops and restaurants), Copely Square (City Library and Trinity Church) and within walking distance to most of Boston's landmarks. Rooms at the Colonnade Hotel are enormous, bright (floor to ceiling windows) and beautifully furnished in a contemporary style with an extraordinary large, comfortable bed and a very efficient, quiet air-conditioning system. There's a coffee maker, full sized ironing board and iron, flat screen tv and lots of storage space. The bathroom is stocked with quality cosmetics, a hairdryer, bath and an excellent power shower. On the minus side I'd have to mention a few things as tweaking them could make this hotel the perfect retreat in Boston. Our room was at the end of a long corridor and beside the access door to the hotel's apartments. From 6-9am and 5-7pm there was a constant flow of people using this route. The continuous loud click as the door was opened, not to mention the fact that guests tended to stop and have a chat before opening the door wore thin after our first two nights (we were too tired to notice initially). I would suggest that guests staying more than two nights are not given this room. I also got the impression that the reception staff were inexperienced and not particularly friendly or interested in our welfare. I did not get the impression that 'customer is king'. However, the bell captain made up for this with his genuinely friendly and helpful manner as did the porters to a lesser extent. Our room was generally very clean but could have done with some closer attention in relation to the skirting boards, scuffed walls and bathroom floor. There's a policy of changing the sheets after three days unless you request for it to be done on a daily basis, however, during our five day stay they were not changed at all. I don't want to sound harsh as the overall atmosphere at the Colonnade Hotel is very relaxed and not pretentious. We would definitely stay there again as the pluses out weight the minuses, however, when paying nearly \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 a night (inc. taxes), with no breakfast you tend to focus on exactly what you're getting for your money. I find value a strange concept in relation to hotels in the US - value to me is when you get a little bit more than you expected but in truth, at these rates I would expect something closer to perfection.

Easy walk to Newbury Street and Coley square etc as is the Boston garden area. walked in the day and early evening and felt safe - plenty of people and traffic about. Pru centre has a great Cheesecake factory restaurant! There is a Shaw's supermarket - I think 24h - across the street too. most of the Boston trolley tours seem to go down Huntington avenue as do the Duck tours but we chose Old Town trolleys ($38 adult) as they stop at the hotels door!

This was a return to the Colonnade after sampling some fine hotels over the past 5 years including the Liberty, Nine Zero and recently the Inn at St Botolph. We chose the hotel due to its proximity to our daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s University and graduation proceedings. The Colonnade touts itself as a hip, boutique hotel after major renovation. Do not be confused by this claim, this is NOT either. It is a hotel confused about what its identity is. It is still very tired in many ways with no soul or style. Its price point generally compares with the hotels mentioned above but does not come close to any of them in a singular category, especially management and follow-through. As always, these are both the keys to success. Upon check-in and moments after, we realized we did not have a key to the mini-bar, no big deal in itself, but we had perishables to store. We turned on the television but it did not work. Attempting to call the front desk, we realized our hotel phone did not work. There was no choice but to go back downstairs, tired after a 6 hour flight, and immediately now had to wait for engineering. Apparently the televisions have issues, and we would get to know engineering quite well over the next days. Okay, small details, but a glimpse of the lack of care and attention to guest services to follow. Our neighbors next door arrived late (we assume from New York), and carried on until about 2 a.m., arguing between themselves through the paper thin walls at the top of their lungs, nearly overshadowing the barking dog they smuggled in. We reported them to management several times and learned of the unwritten dog policy, expecting to have them quieted down and moved appropriately. Due to overbooking the 5th floor, set aside for guests with pets, we were their lucky neighbors. As a dog owner, I love dogs. However, the marital bliss next door between the most obnoxiously loud, argumentative \u00e2\u20ac\u0153love birds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was unbearable, bordering on constant domestic abuse. Late at night, or early in the morning, they kept us awake. After numerous complaints, they finally offered to move me! We were totally situated, and having to pack up my daughter from her dorm and 5 years of school, I was offered the inconvenience of moving by Colonnade staff. Are you serious? You have obnoxious guests, arguing at decibel levels unheard of, with a smuggled dog, that staff indicated was not known to them at check in, and I get to move??? Security and management were both useless in solving the issue by moving them to the appropriate dog floor and not among pet-less guests. It was clear that the problem was mine. Upon check out, I explained to management once again my displeasure with their inability to satisfy the situation appropriately. I was stonewalled by them into thinking I was wrong, and offered a slight rate reduction. I shared with them that guests have a lot of choices out there, including the new W and Ames hotel that both are actually fun and hip. The Colonnade is neither.

Not the case here. First off, the rooms are small and so are the bathrooms! I would rather forego the amenities for a bigger bathroom. It was March so that meant the weather was changing from cold to warm in a matter of days. When Justin brought our bags up he explained the room and it's amenities and such. During this he explained how the building is transitioning from winter to summer and the rooms may seem warm so to just open the windows to get some of that great Boston air. Yeah right. The open windows did not help the heat and the cooling system was not yet turned on, (the air conditioning) so one only had a fan to use and super noisy at that. So, we opened the windows, which have no screens or a bar across, so these things open out and they are long panels makeing it so easy for any suicidal client to have a go at it. The street noise sort of canceled any desire to rest and since they did not lower the room temperature at all during the night (even wide open) no one slept. So what is the point of going to a hotel if you cannot sleep because it is either too hot or too noisy? The next morning we went to complain and instead of finding a solution all we received was an \"I'm sorry\" and she actually started to argue with my other half. She informed him at that time the AC was not on and that there was nothing she could or would do and suggested we could leave. So we did and as fast as we could. Checking out she took off the internet charge and the parking fee, unbelievable. Needless to say, we went across the street to the Sheraton Boston and they took us in happily and warmly giving us an early check in to boot. The concierge was not on his best behavior and sort of threw the map at us and whizzed over the directions and that was it. Placing him in the middle of this large empty unwelcoming lobby makes him seem as if he is a king of some sort; pretty odd set up if you ask me. Anyway, he was a tad snobby and I kept asking myself why. The frustrating part of it all was how much time we lost for playing tourist; the whole day was soured and we ended up rushing to get our car returned at the airport and by the time we got back the rest of the afternoon was just trying to get over the incredulity of their reaction to the issue and the extra physical effort and expense the whole thing cost us. We ended up spending more for our room at the other hotel as well as having to give a nice tip to them to hold the bags while we went to dump our car. So, all in all, not a great experience! Maybe our room was hotter than most or maybe other clients were not as uncomfortable as we were but the next day, (the temperature was higher than it had been the previous day) I noticed from our room with a great view at the Sheraton, most of the windows on the Colonnade hotel were open... Those at the Sheraton told us VIP's like the Colonnade and now I see why, they like the snobby atmosphere and to pay for people to pretend to kiss up to them.

First, the positive: Great location, beautifully designed hotel, rooms and bathrooms are beautiful, with very comfortable beds, great light and views, and nice amenities. The downstairs restaurant is not cheap but is excellent and lovely. the hotel staff is friendly and mostly extremely. My husband and I were traveling with our two teenagers. The negatives might seem unimportant but it rankled us and tainted our experience: One, we requested a non-smoking room. Unbeknownst to us, the 6th floor is the first non-smoking floor, so the smell of smoke wafted up to our floor. The hotel staff obviously sprayed the halls (and maybe rooms) regularly with air freshener, which is disgusting in itself and only makes things worse. Anyone who is healthy and doesn't want to smell smoke also would not want to breath chemical air freshener. It made me feel asthmatic, and I don't have asthma. I learned to cover my mouth and nose with my fleece while I walked in the hallways. Also, the in-room movie (and TV) selection was so poor and sub-standard that it ruined an enjoyable aspect of traveling with my family that we have enjoyed in ANY hotel we've stayed in, even in much cheaper hotels. We had only about 10 awful movies to choose from, none we'd want to watch (although the hotel made sure there was enough porno available!). At almost any other hotel, you get a far superior type of film rental service (it's usually the same service in all hotels), with tons of selections and variety. When I clicked on each movie category at the Colonnade, it came up with the same awful 10 movies. And, when I complained to the front desk, they told me, as did the TV technician, that there was something wrong with the TV in our room, that we should have a lot more movies listed, and that they would fix it. Then, the next night, the same movies appeared. When I complained again, they told me that those were all the hotel's service offered, there was nothing wrong with the TV. So, I was given misinformation the previous night. We were visiting colleges for my son in the pouring rain, and at the end of several very long days and evening activities, we looked forward to settling down and watching a movie, and because of the sub-standard system that the Colonnade has chosen, we couldn't. We spent way too much time trying to wade through the misinformation to try to solve this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall to no avail\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I resented the waste of my traveling time. I would have preferred a straight answer and less time spent on the issue. And, to top it off, the hotel made no effort to credit us with anything to make it up to us. I don't like to ask for credits, so I let it go, but the hotel staff was wrong\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand foolish\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to try to make it up to us in some way with some kind of credit. The hotel is beautifully designed and comfortable, in a great neighborhood, and has a lot of great characteristics, but the smoke/gross air freshener and entertainment deficits really cheapen this hotel experience for the traveler.

The Colonnade's website promises \"large rooms,\" but not mine. I was right next to the elevator with a large chunk cut out of my room to make room for the elevator shaft. The room was both small and noisy. When I checked in, I asked if a room with a couch were available, and I offered to pay extra to get a large room with a couch. I was told no such rooms were available (I subsequently learned they indeed were available for the nights I was there--just not to me). I asked for a room on a high floor, away from any noise. I was put on one of the lowest floors, in an area where everyone had to walk by to get to their large rooms with couches. It was as if the young woman checking me were trying to thwart me in every way possible. The door to my bathroom was broken (no handle, no lock). Was I treated the way I was because I was a middle aged woman? I have no idea, but I am used to being treated well in hotels, so I will never return to the Colonnade and hope no one else will either.

Jimmy the doorman greeted us in a professional manner with a sense of humour. We cannot speak highly enough of Norman who also greets you in a professional manner. Every day he asked if our stay was okay and if we needed anything. We observed him running after guide buses for other guests and going that extra mile, a true ambassador for the hotel. Cindy the concierge who knows her job inside out and could not be more professional and helpful. She purchased tickets for a Red Sox game on the day of play, at very reasonable cost. Any hotel would be proud to have her as front of staff. Reception staff checked us in quickly. Our room was in the front on 11th floor with views to plaza and prudential building. A fairly good room size, enough space for 2 people. The beds were extremely comfortable. En suite facilities as expected standard. The onlt 2 comments, were that air extractor did not come on when using shower.The usual British thing, we could not make a cup of tea with our teabags due to no kettle but there was a machine to make hot bevarages with their supplies.None of these comments were a problem. The subway right outside front door for green line and taxis available. Did not use hotel brasserie, only for the reason that we wanted to check out other eateries. Reccommend Thorntons for cooked breakfast which is just across the street/block. This is not a restaurant but a cafe, which is very cheap and good food, people were queing to get in at breakfast. But the real gem was Quotes cafe in the Mary Baker Eddy library run by Melissa and her friendly staff.

Came back at 7:30 and was told the 2nd room was stillnot ready but would be by 8pm. 8pm came and went and no room. Was told 8:30. Guess what, at 9pm the room was still not ready. When asking the front desk for help and information why the delay, they made me feel like I was intruding. I'm a reasonable person, but to not be able to check in until after 10pm is ridiculous, but even worse is the snooty attitude of the front desk. 2. On the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of my stay, every morning at 7 am, heavy equipment (almost like a concrete jack hammer) began drilling above my room. When I inquired into the cause, I was told tough luck, we have to complete our work. Now again, I am a reasonable person, but I am on vacation, paying over $200 dollars a night and too be woken up at 7am on vacation is unexcusable. Start your work after 9, alert your guests, or send them to another room that won't be disturbed. I left the Colonnade very disappointed with the service and more importantly the attitude.

PROS: - Location is prime (across the street from the Prudential center and walking distance to Newbury Street, Boston Public Garden, Boston Commons) and close to T stops - Spacious rooms - Comfortable beds (too many pillows for my taste though) - Flat-screen TVs - Mini bar refrigerator in room - Robes provided - The bellhop - wonderful gentleman who has been working at the hotel for years and was a real pleasure - If you valet your car, you can leave it parked until 2 PM (I guess other people were told 3 PM) - Roof-top pool and bar - Brasserie Jo is adjoined for food and drinks CONS: - Less than friendly staff on check-in - Walls are paper-thin (I could hear it when the person in the neighboring room was using the bathroom) - Our toilet ran intermittently all night (to the hotel's credit, we did not inform them about it during our stay) - If you want to valet park your car, don't pull up in front of the hotel, it's actually ahead to the right up in a lot - Parking is expensive - Valet does not operate 24 hours a day - When we asked for a mini-bar key, the staff told us it would be awhile because they had to \"look for one\" and they weren't sure they had any left (strange for an upscale hotel) - Unable to accomodate our request for late check-out In conclusion, the location and rooms are wonderful.

As it was our anniversary, we decided to stay for one night and attended Jersey Boys at the Shubert Theater. We arrived two hours before check-in time but because I had applied for an \"i-prefer\" card on-line the night before we had the special privilege of checking in early and also having a late check out. It also enabled us to free internet. The couple checking in before us wanted to check in early but were not allowed to with out the card. I had requested to be away from the elevators and on a high floor and that was gladly honored by the friendly receptionist. Our room was on the 10th floor facing up towards Fenway Park and we were at first concerned about city traffic noise, but we were not bothered by it in the least. The room itself was on the small size but the furniture (king bed included) were not too big for the space. The flat screen T.V. was mounted on the wall and there was also a wet bar. The bathroom was marble-tiled and very pretty and functional. There was a full-length mirror as well as a make-up mirror in the bathroom. A nice added touch were two cozy terry cloth bathrobes in the closet. The Do Not Disturb Sign and Clean Room sign were activated by a switch that lit up outside the door. There was even a door bell! The one down side to the room (1037) was that the door did not seal properly (it was off by almost an inch at the top) and that caused hall noise to be more pronounced inside the room. However, luckily we were at the end of the hall and did not get too much traffic coming by our room. Another great thing about the hotel is the roof-top pool and bar. The staff is friendly at the pool, especially the bartender, but it tends to get crowded during the afternoon and it's hard to get a chair. It also seems as though guests stake out a chair early morning by putting a towel on it and then will go off to breakfast, etc. and leave the chair empty for hours on end to eventually come back and use it. It would be more \"guest friendly\" if a member of the staff monitored this and kept chairs available to people who were actually at the pool!! It would also be helpful if the staff actually checked to make sure you were a paying guest to keep the crowd at the pool down as much as possible. In the morning we had the pleasure of dining at the hotel's French restaurant, Brasserie Jo. The breakfast was excellent. The only complaint was when I asked the waiter if there was a limit on ordering the complimentary breakfast he said \"no, you can order as much as you like\". When we checked out, we found out that wasn't quite true and were charged $6 extra for \"going over the limit\". There is also a $38 charge for parking. In closing I have to say that we had a great experience at this hotel. The staff is friendly and the accommodations were comfortable and clean The extra touches make it feel like a special stay.

We asked for rooms overlooking Huntington Avenue on the front of the hotel but were assigned rooms on the back side of the hotel which overlooks a more residential brownstone area which would be quieter - I still think the front side is the preferred view for most. Some reviews had mentioned hall noise which I think arises partially because there is a bit of a gap between the bottom of the door and the floor - that can be mostly fixed by laying a towel along that gap to muffle any sound in the hallway. It would also be an easy problem for the hotel to fix by putting soundproofing along the bottom of the doors. There is a pool on the top of the building but don't go there if you are looking for a quiet drink and sunshine, there tended to be a lot of kids there which made it somewhat busy and noisy.

I would recomend this hotel, they truly know how to develop repeat customers, I will continue to be one.

I will tell you that being a family of 6 is tricky and/or very expensive when it comes to finding hotels. Most rooms max out at 4 and since our kids are still small, we need to have them in the same room or an adjoining room. I did a lot of searching and found the Colonnade boasted being family friendly, and they weren't kidding. I booked a family package that included adjoining king and double double rooms, breakfast for four, and four tickets to the Duck Tour or Science Museum and fanny packs for the kids for $399. I think this was a pretty good value, considering Duck Tour tickets are $30/adult $20/kids, so $100 there and breakfast (bacon, eggs, potatoes, toast, juice, coffee) was $17.00 if purchased from the hotel. Parking is typical city expensinve ($38 with in/out priveleges), but it's easily accessible and not so small you feel like your going to hit your minivan on the ceiling. The lobby is beautiful and the hotel staff is very friendly. The concierge was especially nice and helpful. They knew us all by name strictly from our reservation and were happy to provide any info we needed. The rooms were very nice, decent sized and we had a fabulous view from the 9th floor. The kids were thrilled with their very own plasma tv in their room and I loved the plush bed and the nice bathroom. The door between the rooms was in a convenient place and allowed good flow between the two rooms. There was very little noise between the rooms/hall, though I might not have heard anything over the typical din of my four kids. I had breakfast sent to our rooms as I didn't want to deal with the four kids in restaurant. There was a mix up with our order, I ordered four, received two, but they fixed it immediately without question. I wasn't overly thrilled with the food, the eggs were a bit to wet for my taste and the bacon chewy, but it was a hearty big breakfast they serve. The rooftop pool was a big hit with the kids, the deck was packed with 20-somethings and the pool is SMALL, but they had fun splashing around anyway. I would highly recommend this hotel for a family visiting Boston if you can swing it. It's great for kids and adults alike, I felt very spoiled here, but it never felt too upscale for the kids.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't have made a better choice!\u201d", "Author": "Lalynn21", "ReviewID": "UR34383032", "Content": "Great location...we could walk most everywhere.

My mother was in town visiting and she stayed in one room and the kids and I stayed in the other room. We split the cost so really, it was only $200 a night for each family. And for Boston with all of these add-on's, it was a great deal. The positives was most definitely the location. We're always trying to find a location that is good for kids. The T subway train is literally right outside the door. The mall is across the street with all of my favorite restaurants...PF Changs, Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen. There was even a Shaw's grocery store across the street where we stocked up on waters, sodas and snacks. The door men were extremely helpful and gracious. The only negative was the rooms were a bit small but when you're in a city, most rooms are not really spacious. The breakfast was also not anything to rave about. If I would have had to pay for the breakfast, I would have thought it was very expensive. I was also a little confused how they calculated the \"free\" breakfast and was worried that they would add the extra's onto my bill but when we checked out, there were NO charges anywhere for any breakfast. They also gave the kids cute fanny packs filled with stuff. They loved them.

First off, this review may be slanted as I'm typically a Best Western value type chick who doesn't enjoy spending $5 for a Vitamin water in the mini bar, though I love having access to one knowing it's there if I need it. Anyway, the reason I selected this upscale boutique hotel is ... my husband was off to Boston with one purpose - Extreme Beer Fest. He was to be involved with his buddies and festival the ENTIRE weekend leaving me to explore alone, etc. I selected this hotel as it was closest to the Cyclarama (sp?) and right outside a t-stop and seemed very safe, upscale without being a stuffy Marriott, youthful and COMFY . Safe/Secure & Helpful! The staff will bend over backwards for you. I locked myself out of the room and waited an entire 60 seconds for someone to help me get back in - they even checked my ID to make sure I wasn't breaking into a room - though I was in my socks and PJs. The concierge is busy, but makes time for you and acknowledges you even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a call or with another customer making you feel important. With a few moments notice, they gave my husband a ride to his walk-able destination (it was bitter cold that weekend!) in their new Smart cars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c super cute cars by the way! I believe they will drive one person within 1 mile of the hotel. Smart cars only have room for one person along with the driver, so couples, this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help you, in my case it worked out fine. Every night when my husband returned late in the evening, they checked his ID and room key to make sure he was really staying at the hotel. This was very comforting to me as a woman spending most of my time alone at the hotel. Also, ladies, the doors have THREE locks on them. Room Service Though slightly overpriced with a $4 service charge and automatic 18% gratuity added, the food was great (I ordered a chicken salad on roll with fries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mmm!)

The special rate included parking ($38 a day)! We travel with our laptops so I'm always checking out the internet connection rates as well. The rate is normally $13.95 for connection, however, as another member pointed out, it's included with the their member program-\"i prefer\" which is free. We've traveled to Boston many times over the years and have walked by The Colonnade but have never stayed. Definately our mistake! The location is fantastic! The \"T-green line\" is literally outside the front door. Prudential Center stop. Across from the hotel is the Prudential Center and the large mall is attached to it. You can actually walk for blocks through the glass walkways. The hotel went through a recent renovation and it's fantastic! The rooms are tastefully done with crisp linens and modern lines. I'm a fan of the king bed but when the kids are with us we have to settle for 2 doubles. The beds were comfy and pillows soft. The room boast large windows and can even open a little to let the fresh air or just get a feel for the temperture outside. We had a wonderful room on the 11th floor and was more of a cube set up rather than the typical long room. Each room has a flat screen t.v and a nifty ipod docking clock. My favorite extra was the extendable reading lights attached to the headboards! The bathrooms are a little on the smaller side but modern and clean which is all I'm concerned with. We never got to the restaraunt or to the fitness area. The pool is closed for the season but I understand it's quite nice and a happening spot. The best part about this hotel is their staff. They were genuinely friendly and helpful. Everyone person you met had a smile and a hello for you. Never once did it feel forced or insincere.

The service extends to other parts of the hotel. Peter at the concierge was absolutely wonderful. From setting up hair appointments for our out of town guests to reserving seats for a duck tour for a group of 20, not task was too difficult for him to handle. He was an absolute pleasure! Every single bell check and doorman was also helpful, courteous, and efficient. As for the room, we stayed in the Suite which was fabulous. Wonderful modern decor throughout, it was quite breathtaking when we walked in. Huge living room with flat screen tv, bathroom with 2 rooms (1 for the shower and 1 sink, and another for the toilet and another sink), dining table, and seperate bedroom with king size bed and desk with chairs, flat screen tv (number 2) and chaise. It was truly beautiful and spacious, one of the best bridal suites in the city! (I had toured all the hotels and their suites... it's an important feature to consider!). The beds were extremely comfortable!! My only complaint was this: the next morning we noticed that our toilet was not flushing properly. We called maintenance, who came to check it out. He said he had to snake it (im not sure what that means), but we were on our way out. We cam back at 1am, assuming that the toilet had been fixed, and when we used it and flushed, it of course wasn't working properly. My husband called maintenance again (it's 1:30am, I went to bed!) and they 'fixed' it. The next morning, the toilet still did not work. Now, I understand that this is an old building, and they have made many expensive renovations to the building, and I was hoping that essentials like plumbing would have been one of them. While this didnt completely ruin our stay, it is something to consider. There service had been 100% perfect up until that moment, so unfortunately I cannot give this hotel an Excellent rating.

I was not disappointed. From the moment I arrived I was warmly greeted by the valet and bellman who ushered me into the newly renovated and decorated lobby and front desk area which had beautiful new marble floors and lobby furniture. I was then greeted by the Concierge who informed me about the new renovations and the amenities the hotel had to offer. He also made reservations right then for my party at their exquisite French restaurant, Brasserie Jo. The bellman escorted me to my room which was fabulously redecorated since my last visit - a very warm feel with a combination of black, white,beige and oak. The new furniture, decorations, beds, bedding , plasma tv and radio with a wide variety of listening choices was very impressive. We went to the bar at Brasserie Jo before dinner and enjoyed a martini from their extensive martini menu - the best I have ever had. We went on to enjoy a truly wonderful dining experience in Brasserie Jo. The food and service were outstanding.

Recently my travels took me to Boston and a friend told me about a hotel that I really should visit. He said that not only was it in the perfect location, the food was incredible, the service friendly and attentive and their attention to detail were stupendous, oh and by the way the value was outstanding as well. I really trust this friend and so I proceeded to book my stay at the Colonnade in Boston. So many hotels \"talk the talk\" but very few \"walk the walk\" but I have to say that the team at the Colonnade does exactly that. My stay was flawless and I'm tough on a hotel. I tend to use all the services and I did so during my recent stay in Boston. My room is also my office and the detail and commitment that has gone in to their newly renovated guest rooms (I heard 20 million) were amazing. Obviously somebody spent a lot of time talking to guests and really thinking things out before detailing their rooms. Everything was where it needed to be and it was intuitive at every step. The design was beautiful and I kept thinking what a great value I was getting with every imaginable amenity in place without overpaying. At almost every hotel I've stayed at, you feel like something was forgotten and you are subject to mistakes from after thoughts - Not at the Colonnade! The room had it all - convenient lighting, wonderful drawer space - DVD player with flat screen HDTV - Wireless Hi speed (really hi speed) internet access - an i-pod docking station - electrical outlets everywhere you need them - stylish reading lamps from his and her on the bed - plush linen with impressively high thread counts - a modern and beautiful bathroom - great views of the city - Oh and by the way, have you seen these cool one cup coffee makers (I never saw them before) but they have that too and it was an awesome cup of coffee. Ok, so the rooms are amazing but what about the service? It was even better. They asked me what my arrival time would be upon my reservation and they were certainly ready for me - I was greeted by name - asked about all of my needs for my visit - they introduced me to their excellent concierge whom I used for many things with great success. All of their staff was friendly, caring and competent. I felt like I was at my second home as they routinely said hello to me as I came and went. One time, I was waiting for a friend in the lobby and I was checked on three different times offering me a drink, directions or simply saying good evening. So, far two for two - what about the food and beverage? I would have to say it far exceeded my expectations. They have an amazing restaurant that is a local hot spot called Brasserie Jo and it was terrific. I enjoyed dinner with business colleagues and they were all impressed and one night I had dinner at the bar and it was equally good. I also had breakfast there daily aside from room service one day and it was awesome. The chef is a major talent and the restaurants ambiance is hip, fun and they must give preference to the hotel guests being recognized each time I dined. I enjoyed the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed sea scallops one night and then splurged with the steak and frittes the other and they were both awesome but save room for dessert -You won't believe it - trust me on this one! Sorry for all the words but obviously I was very excited to find this gem in Boston - I highly recommend it and I'm confident you will too.

The room was comfortable, with a generic eastward view, and the bathroom was huge--I think it was an accessible room as the shower head was on the long wall opposite the shower opening, and not on one of the end walls. The rooftop pool was packed when we visited, but we got chairs quickly and then chaises after a short wait. The music they were playing was far too loud and flat out awful, and the CD kept skipping. My impression had been that the pool did not admit non-hotel guests on weekends, but it was clear that most of the people up there were 'regulars' from the area. The vibe of the pool area is sort of like a Cape Cod country club, and could easily be revamped to something much cooler.

Real convenient to just about anywhere you need to get to. But at some point you have to return to the room you paid a nice little sum for. This hotel is going through a renovation. Good thing. When I called to confirm my reservation, the man said renovations would begin again in the spring, which means half the hotel is renovated. I also requested a renovated room(after reading other reviews), since my wife and were getting away for an anniversary trip weekend. The gentleman said it shouldn't be a problem, and made note of it. I was excited. Until check-in, when the girl at the front desk(who could use a little more enthusiasm when talking with guests) told me it would be an extra 60.00 a night for the newer rooms. This would be a handy piece of information to have when confirming the reservation. I opted not to upgrade, and in hind-sight, I'm happy I didn't. One of the maids showed us the upgraded room. Same size, just flat screen TV, new linens and carpet. Nothing special. The age and neglect of this hotel hits you the minute you get off the elevator.

I stayed at the hotel in July for a conference, and right away I noticed that there was a lot of change going on, as the check-in was set up on some folding tables by the entrance, because half of the lobby was tarped over. I was pleased with my room, which appeared to have been recently renovated - and nicely. The room had stylish new furniture and furnishings, a big flat screen TV, a comfortable bed, wonderful new linens, and lots of quiet. However, several of my colleagues had one of the pre-renovation rooms, and they were furious when they saw my room. Their furnishings looked like something out of a 1960s-era motel, with a tiny little old TV, worn-out linens, etc. They didn't even get the same high-end towels and toiletries that I got. So if you're staying at the hotel during this transition period, be sure to request one of the renovated rooms. Otherwise, you'll end up paying a four-star price for a one-star room and will be as upset as my colleagues were. Other notes: The hotel gym was smallish bt adequate.

All in all, an \"Ok\" experinece if you are buying your room at a discount on hotels or priceline...$125 max for a \"premiere room\" and maybe $99 for a \"deluxe roon\"...but for your own sake, don't pay retail for a sub-standard hotel, restaurant and lodging experience.

My husband and I and high school age daughter were looking at colleges in the area. The Colonnade's location is excellent. It is across the street from the Prudential Center where you can find shopping and restaurants (Legal Seafoods, the Cheesecake Factory, a Food Court, coffee/pastry shops). If that's not enough shopping and eating you can easily walk one block to the Copley Plaza shops and restaurants or you can go the the grocery store also within a block. The 'T' stop on the Green line is literally in front of the hotel and an Enterprise Car Rental office in the basement of the Prudential Center was very convenient for us. Our corner room was spacious enough to have a roll-away and not feel cramped. And I can't say enough about the excellent service from the concierge staff, particularly Peter. The room service pizza was very good. On the downside, we found the room to be rather worn and dated, especially the bathroom. Although they advertise 'marble' bathrooms the tub/shower enclosure is tiled with ceramic. The sink counter top is marble, however. The use of tile or marble is not the issue, but rather their claims made it appear more luxurious than it really is. The grout in the shower is stained and even with care, water leaked badly through the shower curtain when taking a shower. After ordering room service our tray remained outside our door for 2 days, despite a call to have it removed. The second room service tray was picked up in a timely manner. I doubt that we would stay here again, although it was a good value for our 5 night stay.

The first time I was on my own visiting a child at BU and the second time I was there with many family members, meeting there from all over. There were some interesting observations: Both times I was there, our alarm clocks went off in the middle of the night or pre-dawn hours. The first was at 4 am, the second at midnight. Very odd- this has never happened to me anywhere else I have stayed. I guess the housekeeping staff does not turned off the previous guests' settings on the clocks. In addition, a hotel alarm went off late at night during the second visit; the front desk reported it as a \"communication failure.\" I'll say. Made for a lot of disturbed sleep. On the morning of our checkout, the maid could not wait to get her hands on the room and started a massive cleanup before we had checked out. We felt very rushed as a result and had no time for a shower. My brother and his family had it even worse; the maid woke them at 7:45 to clean their room, even though they were not even up yet and by no means had they checked out. When my sister made a small complaint at the hotel restaurant, the maitre de chastized her. A waiter later apologized. Let's hope the waiter finds a nicer man to work for. The bathroom doors in some of the hotel rooms allow for little privacy AND do not lock. (There is a one inch gap in between the two swinging doors.) Good thing I am comfortable with my family and am not too modest. Aside from the man at the restaurant (breakfast), the staff was wonderful, particularly the bellmen. The location is great and we got our rooms for a super price. Parking is stiff......and my blanket both times looked like a thrift store reject. I was afraid to look too closely.

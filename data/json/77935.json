{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Ok, I guess.. I booked my room prior to seeing all the bad reviews on this site. I must admit, I went there expecting the worst. The lobby was clean and the staff were very nice to me upon my arrival so I started to feel a little better. I was given a room on the sixth floor in the main building, not the tower, so that was also a plus. When I stepped off the elevator on the sixth floor, I was greeted by the strong smell of stale cigarette smoke. It was sickening, as I hate cigarette smoke to begin with. I quickly made my way to my room, again, expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised though when I opened my room door. The room was clean and there were no bad smells as I expected. Everything worked and the internet connection was nice and fast so I was feeling better about my decision. A couple things did bother me though. The water pressure in the shower was terrible. You also had to let the hot water run a very, very long time before it got hot. The mattress had some sort of industrial strength plastic protective covering under sheets which made it very hard to get comfortable in the bed. The safety latch on the door was broken off and never replaced which made me a little uncomfortable. On the bright side, the little cafe in the lobby had some fantastic food on the buffet!! The cafe staff was very cheerful and gracious towards me as well. All in all it wasn't that bad of a stay. I just can't shake the feeling that I just got lucky this time.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394634777", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ghost446"}, {"Content": "Loud night in New Orleans!

Let me first start off by saying that the reviews that I read on this site were accurate in it's description of this hotel. I wished that I had listened rather than ignore them. My family and I stayed at this hotel from July 15th - July 19th. When we checked in we were intially assigned to room 914. As soon as we opened the door we were greeted with a terrible odor that wreaked throughout the halls and only worsened as we had entered the room. In an attempt to find the source of this odor I tried to turn on the lights throughout the room only to find out that the light in the bathroom was out. Next, in an attempt to find fresh air, I tried to open the balcony door only to find that in had been sealed shut. I then contacted the front desk, who I must add were polite and courteous, and asked to be moved to another room. I was then moved to room 1004, which was just a small improvement from room 914 (bathroom light was not out). At that point my family and I had decided to try to make the best of our sitiation, after calling around to different hotels and finding out that they were booked of course. In ordor to improve the mildew smell that wreaked throughout the room (and halls for that matter) we made a stop at Target and picked up a large bottle of Febreeze in our attempt to combat the foul odor. Let's just say, it did not help much. So in closing I will advise you NOT to stay at this hotel. Apart from the friendly and courteous staff, this hotel is a wash....", "Date": "Jul 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR775075006", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "This hotel needs a Serious renovation! We stayed at this hotel July 1 - 5 during the Essence Music Festival. Unfortunately, the only positive note of our stay at this hotel was that we were allowed to check in early! The hotel definitely shows its age and wear. The ceiling tiles are dingy and the tile and carpet in the lobby and common areas are worn and faded. The walls and doors of the room were thin and we frequently were awakened at night by the TV's and voices of other guests and staff. The old HVAC unit in our room worked; however, it was covered with dust and dirt to the point that we didn't even want to touch the switch to turn it on and off. There were splotches of paint on the walls in different areas - obviously repairs had been made at some point or another, but the fix up was not done carefully. We didn't have much interaction with the staff and except for one occasion, our room had been made up upon our return each evening. I definitely would not stay at the Best Western Landmark again and would not recommend it to anyone else.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR885926544", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Lovely inexpensive hotel I have nothing bad to say about this hotel.

My husband and I attended an AOL bash and had a wonderful time with the people but the hotel had little entertainment. The club had decent live music but there is no other entertainment in the local vicinity other than a bar around the corner. The restaurant was understaffed and the food was rather cheap in quantity. The service for the rooms was ok although it smelled like a cigarette factory on most of the floors. The staff at the front desk could have been more accomodating and their attitudes towards out of towners was poor. The rooms need an uplift in decor and cleanliness is not a forte as we saw the thickness of dust/dirt on the rugs and around the bed. Breakfast should be called a snack, as the food was cold and not much to talk about for what they charged.

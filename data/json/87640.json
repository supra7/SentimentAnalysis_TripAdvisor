The location is FANTASTIC if you are looking for a real Chicago neighborhood experience. It is one building off Broadway St. which offers everything: restaurants, shops, theater, bars and lively/vibrant/fun people. You can walk to the waterfront (Diversey harbor) about 5 blocks away. You can walk to the \"L\" and get anywhere (including downtown) in minutes. A bit further walk to Lincoln Park Zoo to the south or Wrigley Field to the north if you are in a walking mood. The hotel is surrounded by apartment and condo buildings down a quiet, short street which is charming, homey and lovely. The residents are friendly and boy oh boy do they love walking their dogs! We met so many people and dogs in this spot-it was nuts! The room/hallways/furnishings are dated but CLEAN. The exec king room is plenty big with a closet, fridge, desk, dresser, iron/board, robes, nice toiletries...everything you need. But trust me, you won't be in your room for long-too much to see and do right outside your door but far enough away to make you feel like you \"live\" in this charming neighborhood.

Continental breakfast and newspapers are available (self-service) in the lobby. We usually loaded the tray and brought it back to our room. Coffee, tea and snacks are provided 24 hours a day.

Maid service was very good. The reception staff, day and night, was excellent. Advice and assistance were given readily and always with a smile. Maybe because it is a comparatively small place compared to the modern high rise city hotels, the staff seemed to know each guest and all were greeted with a cheery 'good morning' or 'good evening'. I must single out the young lady on duty during the day, whose name has slipped my mind. Besides being generally helpful, she surpassed herself on my last day when I was checking out. I had ordered a cab and waited outside for the usuall rapid arrival. She noticed I was still there a few minutes later and sent out another staff member to flag one down on the street. 15 minutes later i saw her racing towards me. She herself had run up to the high street and spent ages trying to hail a cab in a very busy morning rush hour period. No success! However, she suggested she arrange a private limosine service to the airport which would cost $10 extra. 5 minutes later I was on my way- many thanks!", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa City, IA, USA", "Title": "\u201cEuropean-style in an all-American city\u201d", "Author": "traveling_grandmothe", "ReviewID": "UR124966151", "Content": "When staying in Chicago for the birth of a grandchild, we lucked out and found a rock-bottom rate for The Willows.

We were looking for a quiet, quaint, historic place to stay in Lincoln Park and the Willows Hotel fit the bill perfectly. The staff was especially helpful. They allowed us to use their computer, printed maps for our expeditions and gave theater recommendations. Rooms were clean and decent sized for a big city hotel. Beds were wonderful with high quality linens. I slept like a dream. Room temperature was perfect at all times. We never had to fiddle with the thermostat once. Showers were hot with strong water pressure. One slight criticism, I wish the rooms had a chain lock. I sometimes worry that one deadbolt is not secure enough in a big city. This hotel seems to attract quiet patrons. There was no excessive noise or rowdiness. The continental breakfast was simple but decent. I had a toasted bagel with cream cheese every morning. They had a nice selection of bagel flavors and they appeared to be purchased from a local bakery rather than Lenders type bagels. The breakfast did not include any hot food, other than what could be toasted or microwaved. It included hard-boiled eggs, fruit cups, yogurt cups, small amount of fresh fruit, good coffee, cereal and other pastries. The public transportation system (Brown line on El) was about 3-4 blocks away. It was an easy and safe walk and we used public transportation extensively. From the Brown line, one can connect with other lines and go almost anywhere in the city. I would strongly recommend purchasing a CTA pass for your Chicago stay.

You can catch the #36 Broadway or #22 Clark(about a block away) to take you to Lincoln Park Zoo, the Mag Mile, the Loop or go North to Wrigleyville for a game. Very nice staff. Front desk bent over backwards to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. PROS: Location, staff, suite room size, mini bar prices and snacks, free breakfast selection, room size, 2 nice televisions, price was resonable, shopping and dining choices nearby. CONS: Overnight parking not available at hotel. We found overnight on Broadway but you have to feed the meter(kind of a pain) There is parking over on Clark at the Landmark/Bally's Total Fitness but it's pricey. No restaurant on site. Coffee shop or sandwich shop would be nice. Room next to stairwell was LOUD. Could not hear it in other room, so just ask for something away from stairs. OVERALL: We had a really nice stay and plan to stay again. Just nice to be able to shop a little and run the stuff back to your room. Then we hopped on a bus (just cross the street for pick up) and went down to the Nature Museum or Lincoln Park Zoo. Definately spend the extra $50 for the 2 room suite, makes it feel like you're at home.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery good customer service\u201d", "Author": "Il0veItaly", "ReviewID": "UR115453358", "Content": "This was my first trip to Chicago.

They were so loud, walking and talking then, turned a air on... nightmare began... the water dripping from their air conditioner to ours made \"LOUD\" banging noise. I'm not exaggerating ... it sounded like someone is hitting metal with a hammer. I was up from 3 AM on. It was impossible to go back to sleep. I told the front desk next morning and they changed our room to top floor. Breakfast was served in the lobby, bagel (It was really good !

The bedroom was a decent size with a king bed (I especially liked the linens\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very white and double sheeted) a nightstand and lamp on each side of the bed, a flat screen TV, a desk, a very small bureau and a closet. The sitting room had a fully stocked refrigerator (at reasonable prices), another TV, two comfortable chairs with a table and lamp between them. The bathroom was past the sitting room. It was very small and poorly laid out. In order to stand at the sink you really needed to close the door, which made it seem even more claustrophobic. Still, the bathroom had a tub/shower combo with good water pressure. What really makes this hotel special was the staff. Each employee seemed dedicated to making me happy. They were always helpful and there were enough of them so I never needed to wait long for attention. Cookies are served everyday from 4-6 and they are good!. We were on the third floor (there are 4 floors total) and the room was quiet. The continental breakfast exceeded my expectations. Along with coffee, tea, decaf, orange juice, they offered bagels, pastries, muffins, yoghurts, fruit cups, apples, dry cereal, assorted flavors of hot oatmeal, and Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches. Nothing was home made, but everything was fresh. The hotel offers free entry into a nearby gym. Parking is either $17/day or $22/in-out privileges.

My room, a first floor \"suite\", was apparently located under the stairwell that leads from the lobby to the second floor. This was not a problem during the day. But, was quite noisy at 3 am on Friday and Saturday night when drunken revelers came stomping home from the local bars. More so when the staff began digging ice from the ice machine next to my room at 6 am for the continental breakfast that the hotel serves in its lobby. In the case of the Willows, the excessive noise could be contained by the simple installation of some acoustic tiles and/or insulation under the offending staircase and more considerate behavior by the staff. The suite consisted of one large room with a wall installed in the middle of it and a couple of chairs, a tv and wet bar in the sitting area. It certainly was not worth the extra expense. The bedroom had a rather old window unit air conditioner which was unnecessary the night I was there. Heat, which would have been welcome the night of my visit, appears to be radiated steam heat as one might find in many older Chicago buildings. The bathroom was tiny and one could nat maneuver around its door without having to close it. The bedding was quite comfortble. However, the room fixtures including carpet were old, worn and appeared to be in need of replacement The neighborhood is quite nice. Many dining and drinking options are available within blocks of the hotel. It is quite close to the Lake Michigan beaches if one is traveling in summer. The hotel does offer a gym membership at a local Bally's. The staff seems a bit inept. Not capable of dealing with difficulties encountered by other guests checking in at the same time I was. There are only a scant few hotels in this neighborhood which is surprising given its proximity to Wrigley Field. My experience at all has been quite underwhelming (including at the Willow's sister hotel, the City Suites on Belmont, which backs up to an active El track). I suspect that the demand caused by the lack of competition in the neighborhood creates an environment where the hotel operators don't have to excel to keep guests coming back.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KC", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, reasonably priced, and in a great neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "KcSuds", "ReviewID": "UR35168870", "Content": "We just returned from a three-night stay at The Willows Hotel and found it to be very pleasant.

This is my second time at The Willows and both times the rates on their website were more expensive than on Expedia. 2) From O'Hare, take the Blue Line to Logan Square and then bus #76 to Sheridan. Get off at Diversey and Clark. It is only one block away from the hotel. 3) Explore the local neighbourhood on foot. There are wonderful shops, especially walking north on Broadway.

The bathroom was very victorian & clean, newly decorated and a nice size - it even had a vented window by the tub to open while you showered, which I considered a plus since there were no fans or other vents in the bathroom. Music is played in the lobby during their extended complimentary breakfast hours, which we found to be a plus. The location of this hotel is wonderful. It is one block from everything you want from restaurants to book stores and other shopping. The area is a hub of hussle bussel, but the hotel is quiet and restful. The staff is very nice and helpful too. Parking was a short distance away, about a half block - you park the car yourself.", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201chome away from home\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4233645", "Content": "I stayed here for the Chicago Marathon and found this great little hotel on the internet.I'm from a small town and not use to a big city but found the Willows to be charming and very safe.

Be forwearned - their internet ad is MUCH nicer than the reality. It's centrally located if you want to stay in Lincoln Park - but it isn't a cute, boutique hotel, even though it advertises itself as one. The lobby was a bit shabby - and the free continental breakfast was fast-foodish, carb-laden, and recycled. We didn't eat it once. The hallways were long and narrow - not very inviting. I felt as if I were walking down an old-fashioned rooming house kind of place - not an inviting little hotel. The elevator was a small, old cage affair (cute in movies, not in real life). Our room was very 1950's - beige, dingy, and dark. We had twin beds, I think - not two queens. Our windows overlooked a parking lot which had an all-night light that shined and made loud noises (so I wore ear plugs and kept the shades down). The bathroom was large - clean - and the products were replenished daily. We could hear someone practicing her flute down the hall - and people having sex in a room above us. The people next door had small kids - which we could hear clearly through the walls. Our TV was small - but hooked up to cable. There wasn't a closet - just an old armoire. I checked out the Days Inn a few blocks away - and The Willows was definitely better - but it wasn't a great, charming, adorable place by any stretch of the imagination.", "Date": "January 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "seneca, illinois", "Title": "\u201cstay at the willows\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2798369", "Content": "We stayed one night at The Willows while we were downtown for work.

The lobby was cute & the room was nice & clean. There were a few minor issues that popped up though that altered my original impression. I managed to score one of the previously mentioned 01 rooms with a view of tree-lined W Surf St. Although small, the room was bright & had a fresh, clean smell. When I walked back to the hotel from the parking lot, I noticed many air conditioners in the windows of the rooms, however my room didn't seem to have one. Fortunately it didn't get very warm & it wasn't an issue, but I wouldn't want to stay in that room on a hot, sticky day. The bathroom was clean, cute & a little small. The main issue I had with the bathroom though, was the water pressure. Showering became very difficult as the water quickly went from hot, to cold, back to hot, slowed to a trickle, back to cold, etc... In spite of these inconveniences, I would recommend this hotel to others. It is in a great location & the staff is very friendly & helpful.

Perhaps the greatest asset of this hotel is the neighborhood: it's nice to be in a residential area filled with lively service businesses...you have access to some real Chicago living here away from the bustle (and cost) of downtown . The hotel itself is perfectly serviceable and well maintained, with a charming little lobby area, and relatively generic non-descript rooms. We prefer the rooms in the front of the hotel (the 00 and 01 rooms) which are smaller, but cozier somehow.

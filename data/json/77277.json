The only negative thing that we may say is that it's a bit noisy the night because of the area, but this is what you get when you want to be in the heart of Hollywood (though it wasn't a big deal to sleep after a long day enjoying LA).

When we travel, I like things to be perfect, so I took the time to read several reviews about this place. Most of them were positive so I booked it. When we arrived at the hotel (which was easy to find using our GPS), the first thing I noticed was that Sunset Blvd. was a busy street, and that made getting in and out of the parking lot a bit tiresome. The parking spaces are small and limited, but we had no trouble with parking. The hotel was smaller and less polished than I anticipated (more like a three story motel). The Manager (Anisur) allowed us to check-in about an hour and a half early, which was a big help. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but the carpet needed cleaning. We walked about the room in our socks and within 2 minutes they were visibly dirty. Breakfast was good - a nice variety of things to choose from, but the breakfast area is small and can feel congested if more than eight people are there at one time. The hotel is located within walking distance of eating places and other amenities (7-eleven, Rite-aid, iHop, Starbucks, Burger King etc.), and about 7-10 minutes walk to Hollywood Blvd. When we stayed there, they were doing road work out front so we had a couple noisy nights to contend with, but that's temporary. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe, but I wouldn't let kids run around by themselves. All in all, this was a good choice for the price. Don't expect a three star hotel and you'll enjoy your stay.

We always wipe down every hotel room with anitibacterial wipes as soon as we arrive, and this room was no exception. In most every hotel we have ever stayed, even 4 and 5 star ones, the wipes are black when we are finished. This room totally passed the \"white glove\" test.

But i could connect to Starbucks wireless net if i had wanted to. and there is an internet cafe right across the street that is cheap if you really need a connection. there was a little noise at night, but that is to be expected when staying right on Sunset Blvd not far from the walk of fame, and the hollywood and highland complex. Nothing that a pair of ear plugs can't fix. i would stay at this hotel again.. i am frequently in the LA area, and i am sure i will end up at this hotel again :)", "Date": "February 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cMinimalist Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Westumbria", "ReviewID": "UR4155774", "Content": "This hotel is super simple. It is clearly 1950s with some modest renovations. The actual room was adequate and very clean. I was able to use my laptop as they seem to have a free wireless internet connection for the guests. The pool was quite small and cold, but very clean. Doughnuts and coffee are on offer in the morning. My only complaint about this hotel is that the price is a bit high for the area and there is a lack of security. It is possible to access the hotel by several different doors and none seem to be closely monitored by the hotel staff, but my room did have double locks. What more, the hotel's location is in an area that seems to be on the margins of tourist Hollywood and a run down residential area with a liquor store on the corner.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn Near the Sunset Strip", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77277-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Near_the_Sunset_Strip-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$74 - $160*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7051 Sunset Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90028</span></span> (Formerly Travelodge Sunset La Brea)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "77277", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/14/f4/14f4a0d72bf271d284a52f0ca4fc7d165large.jpg"}}

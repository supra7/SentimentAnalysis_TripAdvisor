At check-in, they didn't have our reservation in their computer. Luckily, I printed out my confirmation for our prepaid 2 queen bed suite...they didn't have any suites available that night which we had paid for so we were put in a regular room and changed to the suite for the next two days of our stay there. We were given a free bottle of wine for our troubles but not offered any money back on our prepaid stay. I would have spoken to the manager about this at check-out but that's when we ran into another problem there! WARNING: If you do stay here, double check the entire contents of the mini-bar!!!!!!!!! Verify that everything they say is in there, actually is in there or else they will try charging you for items you never consumed. The manager on duty who was checking us out informed us we were being charged for three items. Since I only had one bottle of water from the mini-bar, I told her this and she immediately went up to our room to check. She came back and told us again the items had been replaced the day before. After a couple of minutes of insisting we had only taken one item, the manager rudely said \"Well somebody did\". Obviously, she didn't believe us, but finally took the extra items off our bill. That being said, the Majestic was a nice hotel in a nice area, I'm sure these incidents dont happen to everyone but please do yourselves a favor and verify the contents of the mini-bar so there are no issues at check-out. Also, this hotel is definitely not for anyone with a wheelchair.

My stay was less than a third of the cost of staying elsewhere, yet I received excellent service, and it was a convenient location (just a five minute cab ride from downtown) . In these difficult economic times it was refreshing to find a good value. More importantly, its the little things that count. (Which also happen to be where most Hotels gouge you). While the Hotel has a quaint older charm, it did not lack any modern amenities. They have free wifi, large flatscreen TV's and a low priced 24hr interactive movie/entertainment package. I could not believe the pricing for the mini-bar/snacks which were only $1-$2 each. My room was large, clean and the bed was very comfortable.

Given that it has taken me twelve months to finally write a review it is entirely possible that my review may be outdated and my comments no longer applicable. I chose the Majestic for a number of reasons. First, I like to stay in accommodation that is unique to a city and I try to avoid the big chain hotels whenever I can. Second, the Majestic was/is close to where a friend currently lives. Third, it was recommended to me by another friend who had stayed at the hotel a year or two before. Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Majestic. Although the hotel is old and the furniture perhaps somewhat dated, that is part of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charm and, despite its age, my impression is that the hotel is generally well-maintained. I had little to complain about regarding my room, with only one exception mentioned below. I was lucky enough upon arrival to have my room upgraded from a Standard Queen to a King Suite with a den overlooking quiet, tree-lined West Brompton Place. The King Suite (Room #101) was wonderfully spacious, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom spotless, and the large windows in the den helped to create a bright and sunny environment. What I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find so good about the room was the air-conditioning, which did not operate very effectively, in my opinion. There was always some dampness to the air even after the air-conditioning unit had been running for an hour or so. I should note that the air-conditioning unit in my room was ancient and probably needs to be replaced, if it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced already. The plastic frame covering the unit was badly cracked and had a propensity to fall off. The unit was also quite loud when it was operating and I usually had to turn the dial to the least powerful setting to ensure a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Something else that bothered me a bit was what I would characterize as a musty smell that pervaded the room. Whether this odor was related to the poor air-conditioning, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. The musty odor was most obvious as soon as I came back from a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sightseeing. Nevertheless, I should make it clear that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily an unpleasant odor and, moreover, I would always find that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it very much after an hour or so back in the room. Meanwhile, I should also make clear that I never noticed any signs of mold or mildew in the room and, upon reflection, I now have to wonder if the smell was nothing more than the odor of an old building with old furnishings! :-) On a more positive note, I found the service at the Majestic to be exceptionally good and very professional. Two staff who were working at the Majestic at the time I visited and who might still be there, Richard and Gustavo, were particularly helpful. Richard provided useful transportation tips on how to get to the hotel from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare when I called to confirm my reservation, and during my stay Gustavo similarly provided good information on which buses to take to get to downtown and to certain specific sights. Gustavo was also very patient with me when I kept returning to the reception desk to replace/recode the access cards to my room when the cards mysteriously stopped functioning. Indeed, my room access cards failed at least four or five times during my stay and it took a while to figure out why this was happening. When sightseeing and using my camera, I would often place my camera case into the same pocket where I had placed my access card. What I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken into consideration was the fact that the camera case has a small magnet embedded in the case\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cover flap. It eventually dawned on me that it was quite likely the magnet that was messing up the coding entered into the access cards. Once I began putting the camera case into a different pocket, the problem with the access cards ceased! With any luck the hotel is now using less sensitive room access cards! :-) The Lakeview neighborhood where the Majestic is situated is predominantly residential and is a quiet, beautiful, and safe neighborhood to explore. There are a number of good restaurants in the area, especially on North Broadway and North Halsted and a couple of grocery stores nearby as well. The hotel provides breakfast in its ground floor common area and although what is provided is nothing special, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. and is enough to get one going in the morning. Meanwhile, the hotel is only a half block away from the bus stop on North Lakeshore Drive and bus service along Lakeshore Drive to downtown Chicago is very good (the travel time by bus was usually no more than twenty minutes). Finally, as many reviewers have noted, the Majestic is ideally situated for people who want to catch a baseball game at Wrigley Field; the venerable baseball stadium is only a ten to fifteen minute walk from the hotel. All in all, the Majestic provides decent accommodation in a wonderful neighborhood and should be considered by anyone who wants to stay somewhere else other than Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downtown core.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cTiny room, tiny.

Nice looking rooms, decently located, pretty good rates for Chicago. Actuality is the hotel is tucked way down in-between high rise buildings. The first floor rooms are numbered in the 400's to give the allusion that it is a real building. The rooms are just as cramped as the building is. Our double queen room was barely 20 x 20, and all crowded with odd furniture. There were TWO refrigerators in our room...and the hotel is bragging about how green it is? Which leads me to my biggest gripe with this establishment, which is the manner in which the staff behaved towards their guests. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a bellhop who was indifferent about helping with our luggage. Ummm.....do you work for tips? He asked me if I wanted help at the front desk and I told him yes, we would need a luggage cart brought to the front of the hotel. Because the lobby of the hotel is actually underground, due to above mentioned architecture, the bellhop informed me that they couldn't get their luggage carts to the front door because of the flight of stairs leading to street level. OK, so I just carried all our luggage in- four trips. The bellhop just watched....The desk attendant informed us about their \"green\" policy for washing towels, which is basically that they don't come into your room and switch out your towels during your stay, unless you ask for clean towels. I said to just leave our towels (and room) alone for our stay. However, this was not communicated, and housekeeping entered our room the next day and cleaned it while we were out on the town. Normally I would be ok with this minor mix up, but not only did they clean our room, they took the liberty of moving our personal items, such as our snacks on the kitchenette, and removing what they considered \"trash\", which included various newspapers and bags/boxes we had from shopping.....ummmm thanks for checking in with me on that, housekeeping. Feel free to just drop in anytime...The hotel was noisy all night, as there are concert venues nearby and lots of people coming and going from these and bars. The staff accused us -twice!!!- of smoking in the room, which was untrue and unfounded, and they actually entered our room twice during our stay to \"check\" for smoking. By the way, you sign a $200 cleaning-fee-for-smoking contract when you check in. So obviously, we would not smoke in the room. The hotel did smell like smoke all the time, mainly because of all the concert kids out in front smoking. Everytime the front door opened, the wind carried it in. I was absolutely insulted and infuriated by these \"room checks\", like I was living in a dormitory. I am pretty sure that the Majestic uses this a way to increase revenue- a nice surcharge on your bill based on nothing. They did not charge us, and although they accused us it was obvious that we had not been smoking in the room, therefore the matter was dropped....until we tried to check out, and the manager made us do a walk through of the room to check for smoke. Absolutely ridiculous. Again, no smoke, ashes, cigarettes, rolling papers, nothing... just a stern warning that they dont allow smoking here. Yeah, we got the point when we signed the contract!

We walked around several evenings and always felt safe. Breakfast was typical hotel continental style food....cereal, yogurt, bagels, muffins. Coffee and cookies available all day. The hotel is only a block from the bus stop and with help from Mona and Richard, we bought a pass and took the bus downtown (about a 10-15 minute ride) several times over. Very easy to navigate.

We spoke to the hotel staff and all they said was basically, \"well, that's why the price is so good.\" They did agree to \"shut off\" the system the second night but then restarted it at 5 or 6 AM on a Sunday (and on the day of the time change, no less.)

Loved the amenities, continental breakfast in the morning and cookies in the afternoon; frig, microwave & wet bar in the room. The bed was comfy, though the hide a bed wasn't both as a couch & a bed.

I found this hotel by reading reviews on this website when looking for hotels close to Wrigley Field.

I was looking for a close place to stay since I was coming from STL and taking my Cubs' fan boyfriend (I know it's hard to believe since I'm a Cardinals fan) to his first game at Wrigley, and wanted to be able to walk since I knew we'd be drinking and wanted to avoid the hassle of getting there. This place was a real find. The several times I had talked to someone at the hotel on the phone they were very friendly and helpful. This was the same when we arrived. It is a very quaint little hotel in the middle of a bustling, nice old neighborhood. Yes, it is old (quaint implies this) and does have window A/C units, but this didn't bother us at all. The room and bathroom were very clean. Landscaping and flowers and people out and about made walking around there enjoyable and felt safe. The walk to Wrigley is about half a mile, and there's plenty of stores/restaurants all around within walking distance. Just ask the front desk for anything in particular and they will kindly direct you there. The room we stayed in was one of the larger (the king with sunroom) and it was very nice and comfortable and welcoming. The hotel overall is welcoming as soon as you walk in and see the cozy lobby/sitting room (always with free coffee). Parking is down a few blocks but still convenient considering the sparse parking availabilty, and pretty reasonable at $22/day for Chicago.

SAFETY: It is on a narrow, tree-lined, residential apartment-heavy street where you'll see people walking, dog-walking which made me feel relatively safe. PARKING: If you are driving - NO easy parking & at times, NO parking. You can luck out and possibly park on the street (rare opening) or you can resort to using the large apartment building's miniature parking garage next door. It's VERY expensive. I think someone mentioned that you must drive around the block and go in the back to park, but there is a way to navigate through the garage back to the front of the of the block, turn right and you are at the Majestic front door. ROOMS: Very small but clean. Nice bed, decent linens. Clean bathrooms. Robe was plush to the touch but not used as it had dried shaving cream or mousse on the collar (not clean). Small TV which is fine for a very small room. As it is a much older building, also can hear most everything on floor, doors, creaking wooden floor halls. ELEVATOR: One. Tiny. Difficult to get luggage for 1 person and yourself on the elevator but there is a large staircase. Library/Living Room/LOBBY combo: Dark wood. Lovely. Coffee, tea, breads in the early mornings.

I say this because at this point in time I think we are in a good position to recoomend the Majestic. This hotel does a good job of providing a relaxing atmosphere. It has a European/English B&B feel in that the rooms vary in size, has a nice sitting area, no parking facility, and is on a quaint residential street. My wife felt more comfortable here than any other place we have stayed when in the states. Yes, many of the rooms have next to no view, but same can be said about many of the rooms in downtown Chicago as well most of the hotels in London. For a leisure traveller to Chicago (without kids), it has the most important quality a hotel needs to have: a very comfortable place to start and end each day. For travelers with kids, there is this concept called a CITY PARK literally two blocks away; complete with playgound, tennis courts, softball fields, a beach for dogs, a golf course, and even a totem pole. The hotel is a little over four miles north of the loop, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, and Grant Park. Being a half block off the lake, it is a perfect distance for an early morning run before work or play. There are options of a free quick continental breakfast in the hotel or a number of good breakfast places nearby, such as Ann Sathers, IHOP, or Nookies. There is a Starbucks, Einstien's bagels, and Caribou Coffee within walking distance. All of which are not far off the path to the El, and have high cab traffic going by. As far as the parking goes, if your willing to walk a couple blocks and willing to abide by the closing hours, there is the option of parking on the other side of Lake Shore Drive in the park.

When we arrived at the hotel with our children (no extra little perks for kids by the way) and our many bags, we were not offered any help with our luggage. We struggled into the hotel with kids in tow and had no idea where to park or how to get all our bags in while blocking the street. The lady at the desk directed my husband where to park (which was a parking garage you entered by going around the block)(leaving out the information on how to get back in the building without walking around the entire block) and after asking if I needed help with all of our luggage, (FINALLY), she, rather than grabbing any bags, picked up my two year old son. We spotted a rack to put all our bags on (rather than her letting us know there was one) and we then had to squeeze luggage and family into their very small elevator to get to our room. Never having been to Chicago, and arriving close to dinnertime, we were hungry and had no idea where to go for food. This hotel has no restaurants and no room service (the few times we called down to ask a question or needed something we were told to come down to the desk and they would help us). Therefore, the first night we asked the front desk where a family might go to eat a family friendly casual dinner within walking distance. They sent us to an Italian candleit restaurant (granted, within walking distance) where our children had no room to be comfortable and we could not even read the menu. We left there shortly after we arrived and instead walked to a carry out place we had spotted two doors down that had a very family friendly menu and atmosphere. (thank goodness) As far as breakfast, the Majestic does have a continental breakfast consisting of juice, coffee, bagels and croissants. However, not something you want to eat every morning for any length of time. They offer cookies and coffee in the evening. They are supposed to offer coffee and tea 24 hours a day but more than twice when I attempted to get coffee the canisters were empty. As far as friendliness, they always had a smile for my son when we came out of our room, but not even a hello to my daughter or the rest of the family.

It was our first visit to Baltimore. We found the Four Points to be a great, convenient place to stay and would definitely stay here again. Location and Transportation-We wanted a place close to the airport due to an early departure and this hotel is the closest to BWI (less than a 4 minute drive in the shuttle). We relied on the shuttle system to get around, and it did not disappoint. The driver's were helpful and friendly. They explained where to get the light rail and how to get back to the hotel from the light rail station (simply call the hotel for a pick up). I could not have asked for more convenient transportation. The hotel also arranged for a taxi to take us to the college open house because the light rail does not start running until 11:00am on Sunday. Room-The room was basic and clean. The carpeting could have used a cleaning, but overall, the room was very clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Internet was free. Michener's Restaurant-The hotel restaurant is down a set of stairs in the lobby. The staff is fast and efficient. The food was good....nothing fantastic, but good, enjoyable food. The bread they give you while waiting for your meal was excellent....worth a trip to the restaurant on it's own! Although we did not get the full Sunday brunch because we were in a bit of a rush, it looked good and there was plenty of food from which to choose. The only drawback to the food situation, really, was that they do not start serving room service until 6:00am. We had to leave by 5:15am and had room service been available earlier, we would have ordered it. Just a minor inconvenience. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay. The Four Points definitely knows how to cater to the airport/business crowd and makes your stay very easy. I cannot say enough about the transportation system. It was just myself and my daughter traveling alone, and the hotel staff made sure we knew exactly where to go to catch the light rail and the shuttle back to the airport.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice place, great value!\u201d", "Author": "Vacationfoodlover", "ReviewID": "UR126523796", "Content": "Very nice hotel at the airport that also provides parking for your trip.

Free wifi throughout the hotel.

It's conveniently located very close the airport (there is a shuttle service available though you MUST use the convenience phone inside by the baggage claim to let them know you've arrived for pick up) so you're not stuck riding about looking for the place after you've landed. As this is a 4 Points hotel, they have those wonderful Sheraton sleeper beds so you're guarenteed a good night's rest. There is a bar and restaurant on the premises and room service is offered as well, but be advised that if you do lunch in there, the menu, though stocked with super tasty crabcakes and the like, is very limited. I'm saying this because we had a vegetarian in our group who kind of got sick of ordering the same two things from the lunch menu after a few days. Please note, though, that the food is very good and that the dinner menu is a bit more expanded in offerings. If you chose to go offsite for meals, there isn't anything in safe walking distance (by safe, I mean that the area itself if safe but there is a large criss-cross of busy roads leading to and from the airport that would require lots of courage and not very many brain cells to traverse so it's wise to either find other transportation out). The hotel shuttle will bring you to the nearest train station so that you can catch public transportation to the harbor front or other shopping areas. Be advised that you can take a local taxi but it's not cheap. A ride to the harbor area will cost between 15 and 20 dollars, despite the fact that it's not terribly far away. It may be the way to go, at any rate, if you have cabin fever and don't want to try to figure out the local public transportation tables at the the train station. Just FYI. A little gift shop is also onsite selling stuff like magazines, chocolate, t-shirts or any forgotten item you might need at a moment's notice. They also have a tiny fitness center if you feel the need to burn off those crabcakes you ate (a treadmill, an elliptical and freeweights as well). FYI: since this hotel is so close to BWI, you will hear aircraft taking off and landing. It's not screechingly loud (I live near a military base so it's not really a big deal for me) but you can hear them. If this kind of thing bothers you, you may want to find something farther out. The rooms are very clean with wi-fi available and the usual cable tv offerings. The only bugger for me was that there isn't really a quiet way to shut the doors to the rooms so every time someone left, the door would slam and that can be a pain when all the party animals are returning to their quarters at 1 in the morning and you have get up early the next day. Finally, the hotel staff was awesome. From the extremely helpful people at the front desk, to the cool room service folks and to Collette and the ladies in the gift shop and the rest of the staff, they couldn't be more pleasant.

This could have just as easily been an older Marriott or a Holiday Inn. I chose this property because it was relatively inexpensive (about $70/night via Priceline) and provided free shuttle service to the train station for easy access to both Baltimore and DC. The lobby of the hotel is large, yet the low ceilings make it feel somewhat dark. Around the corner sits access to the outdoor pool courtyard and the hotel's conference rooms. The hotel's guest rooms fill multiple two-story wings that surround the pool courtyard and most have either a view of the pool courtyard or the massive parking decks of the airport next door. This hotel really is the closet hotel to BWI airport. Just make sure you go right instead of left when turning into the hotel or you'll end up dead-ending into the expensive airport parking garage rather than the free outdoor lot of the Four Points by Sheraton hotel. My wing of the hotel lacked an elevator, so I was forced to carry my luggage up the stairs to my 2nd floor room. The hallway on the 2nd floor felt almost claustrophobic, with old, dark carpeting and ceilings that could not have been more than 7 feet high. At 6'3\", I nearly hit my head on the exit sign coming out of the stairwell. The rooms themselves are clean and feel slightly more modern than the rest of the hotel, with a nice desk and free internet access, however the low popcorn ceilings provide hints at the hotel's age. Room service is limited, and there are no restaurant options outside of the hotel lounge within easy driving distance from the hotel. I opted for an $18 cheese pizza one night because I was too tired to get back on the highway and drive to a different exit in search of an Applebee's or even a McDonald's. No free continental breakfast at this property, either. The one big plus to this hotel was the free shuttle to the Amtrak/MARC train station, which provides easy access to both downtown DC and Baltimore, with continuing Amtrak service to New York City.

Yeah, it's probably seen better days, but I've definitely stayed in worse - and ones that were more misrepresented by the hype. We arrived to see a rather crowded lobby, full of members of a church convention. They were all dressed to the nines, and having prayer circles, so it wasn't like an unruly crowd or anything. I think this hotel only has two floors, with rooms sprawled out over a relatively large area. It took quite a bit of walking to get to our room, but that was okay, because I think the distance kept us away from the noise of the convention goers. The room was a little small, but otherwise it was clean and attractive. it looked like an older room that had been refurbished. The air conditioning worked well (it was a HOT day), and thankfully so, because the extra dehumidifier in the room was broken. Still, we were more than comfortable in the room, and with the air cranked to max, we never heard any noises from the other guests or the nearby airport. We decided to eat dinner in the small downstairs bar, since we concluded that the holy rollers were probably not going to be drinkers...and we were right (the few of them who came in ordered a soda or juice). With the light crowd, service was friendly and quick. We had a crab soup that was to die for (I'd almost go back just for the soup!), along with a filling chicken quesadilla. The drinks were tasty, and they even had a couple of decent brews on tap. Like another reviewer stated, there is a very small TV behind the bar, which is a pain to watch, but in all fairness, there is also a large-screen TV on the side wall. But the best part of the Four Points is the convenience to BWI. We were leaving for a couple of days, so we left our car in their free parking lot, and took advantage of the free shuttle service. Unlike many airport hotels, the Four Points shuttle runs on demand, rather than on a fixed schedule. When you're ready to go, so are they! And they are really close to the airport, so it's maybe a 5 minute ride to the terminal. So to sum it up, the convenience was great, and the accommodations were good.

However, its also only a 12-15 minute drive to downtown (or you can take the hotel shuttle to the airport terminal and catch the train into downtown). This is an older property that is showing its age in places, but overall was very clean. Our room was on the first floor right around the corner from the lobby, and was a bit noisy. There was a convention going on at the hotel and when people walked by the room talking, we could hear every word they said (especially annoying at 1am!) Our son stayed on the second floor and said his room was very quiet, so apparently location is important.

The room is very clean, but since it is an old building there is a lingering smell that is hard to explain. Bathroom is clean. You also get complimentary breakfast. For the price, I think it is expensive because it is near the airport. But for the quality I think it is too expensive. They have a restaurant, but if you eant to go out to eat, the nearest fast food is a couple miles away. Because of the price I will not stay at this hotel again.

After a quick check-in experience with friendly receptionists, the shuttle returned us to the airport where we caught the Light Rail (the metro transportation system). Our destination? An Orioles baseball game. We returned following the game, showered and watched a little television before turning in. I will say that I got a little worried when, at about 10:30-11 p.m., some odd and very loud jackhammer-ish noises began emanating from somewhere within or nearby the hotel. I let it go for about a half-hour before I called the front desk to ask them about the source of the noise. The lady that answered the phone acted as if she was unaware of the noise. Rightttt. Then a voice behind her mentioned something about road construction nearby. Made sense. I just couldn't believe the hour at which said construction was taking place. Must have been an emergency repair? The hotel was full so we couldn't be moved (not that that would have helped) and no comp or credit was offered for our inconvenience. Turns out the noise lasted about an hour, which was just enough to get my blood pressure going while the rest of family snoozed obliviously. I finally did get some sleep and the noise wasn't an issue for the remainder of the night.

I was working near Security Blvd, but could not find any hotels in that area with encouraging reviews. I booked at the Sheraton Four Points BWI because of the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Without a doubt, this property lived up to the reviews! I was thoroughly impressed, especially for the nightly rate I received through my business' travel agency. A previous reviewer said something to the effect of: \"Finally, a hotel claiming to be remodeled which really *was*!\" I couldn't agree more. Finding the hotel was easy, just drive to the airport and follow the signs indicating \"Hotels.\" It took about 25 minutes to get from the Security Blvd exit on I-695 to the hotel. From the outside, the hotel is obviously fairly old; two-story, white brick, mid-century design. It didn't look too impressive from the outside, but the moment I walked in I was blown away. The lobby is nicely decorated and inviting. The front desk staff was professional, prompt, and courteous. One front desk employee actually admonished another who was momentarily ignoring another customer while finishing a filing task, saying \"finish that later. Always attend to the customer first.\" My room was on the second floor, a decent walk from the front desk, but easy to find. The room was in perfect order when I arrived, with the heat already on (it was a chilly, rainy day). The room was very nicely decorated and had the much talked-about flat panel TV. There was a comfortable desk chair and a small but serviceable lounge chair, as well as two small ottomans (ottomen?) that could serve as seating. The bed was a very comfortable King. I was very pleased to see that the bottle of water on the desk was complimentary. My sleep was pleasant and restful. When I awoke, my folio had been slipped under the door. At checkout, the front desk staff simply asked if I had any questions and when I replied in the negative, she indicated that nothing else was needed to complete my checkout. My only two gripes about the room were (1) the HVAC unit was a little loud, but it did not keep me up, and (2) while in the shower, I got several warm and cool flashes of water. Not hot enough to scald, but a little surprising when they hit.

This is an older property but the remodel was great! The rooms have gold fixtures in the bath and flat screen TVs. The beds were comfy and everything was very clean. Very nice new decor. The layout of the entire hotel is less than desired. It seemed as though the hallways were designed as an afterthought. Somehow they messed up my reservation and they cancelled our room. My bad for not checking up behind them!!! If it were not for the unfortunate events that happened our first night I would have given it a better rating. There were 2 family reunions at the same time, which kept the hotel very busy. Granted, hotel security did a great job at handling it but there was severe overkill when the guard pulled a fire alarm at 2:00am when he thought he smelled cigar smoke coming from a room. Duuuh!! This evacuated the whole hotel and had old and young standing out in the parking lot in rollers and PJs. After the Fire Dept. left, 6 TSA Officers showed up and proceeded to throw out the person whose room it was. The next day, someone was smoking weed in their room (it could be smelled in the hall)and security went knocking on every door pretending to be housekeeping. When no one answered, they proceeded to open each door and see if they could smell anything. (Don't know how legal all this was!?!) They found the culprits called TSA and had them put out. I would definitely stay there again.

As other reviewers mentioned, the staff is very pleasant and knowledgable about the area, with directions on hand to just about everywhere in Baltimore. We also used the convenient and prompt airport van service to catch the light rail system to the inner harbor--my boys thought this was quite an adventure.

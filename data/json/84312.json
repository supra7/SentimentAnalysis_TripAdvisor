We deliberately didn't book any accommodation in advance, waiting to see where we would end up, and subsequently booking overnight stays at the last minute via hotels.com. Once we realised we were going to be in Daytona we surfed all the late deals we could get. There were all manner of deals available, with all the usual Marriott's etc making good offers, but the high regard in which the Sun Viking Lodge is held on Tripadvisor led me to book this independent accommodation. Hotels.com managed to fleece me by allowing me to book an upgraded \"Ocean View\" room, but they failed to arrange this with the hotel, who resolutely put us into a room with a view of the car park. Now I quite accept that the error here is hotels.com, not Sun Viking Lodge. However I was hugely disappointed that the desk staff, even when I showed my booking confirmation email with evidence of my having booked an Ocean View room, refused to rearrange my room. While they were brilliant at getting hold of numbers with which to try to contact hotels.com customer service, the repeated insistence that the mistake was nothing to do with them actually became insulting and irritating. You'd have almost believed that they weren't getting any money from my booking, which of course is just not the case. Having spent ages trying (and failing) to get hold of hotels.com, and having been abandoned at the desk by the check-in staff, I decided that life was too short and that I just wanted to get into my room, any room. So I gave in. When I read of other guests having problems and being helped so genuinely, I do feel aggrieved that I was effectively abandoned by the staff. I try to be fair and measured in my reviews, and I certainly don't hold Sun Viking Lodge responsible for the error in my booking. But I do feel their customer service in failing to help me out when I was clearly upset fell below what I would expect, especially from an establishment with a Tripadvisor award The room was clean, smelling strongly of disinfectant, with a large bedroom area, a rather dated, non flat screen TV, a dated kitchen aea and old school tiny bathroom. It was a motel room, not a hotel room, and as such was fine. But as one of seven comparably priced rooms I booked back to back over as many days it was the least impressive by some distance. I write this review in a Radisson in Orlando which cost almost to the dollar the same as the Sun Viking last night, but feels in a different league in terms of quality. So how does this hotel get such great reviews. Or alternatively, why is my review so crabby compared to so many others? The answer must lie in expectations, I suppose. This is a resort motel, with loads going on, many things for which you'd be paying extra to keep the kids entertained. As such it represents excellent value, and the staff are a credit to the owner. So my message is to take my review with a pinch of salt if the myriad extras are important to you. But if you're looking for a quality roof over your head for a night or two, you might feel, as I do, that your money is better spent elsewhere.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, OK", "Title": "\u201cA Great Time at a Great Place\u201d", "Author": "Mark B", "ReviewID": "UR136899714", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Sun Viking Lodge while I was in Daytona attending to family business and for a small vacation.

Now don't get me wrong this is no 5 star resort, but it is however very nice and clean for the money. It's best if you call ahead and reserve the beach view rooms, prefferably top floors for noise reduction. The reason I say this is a great place to stay with children, is the POOLS, they have a wonder pool with a huge slide outside, and they also have a very nice indoor pool incase the weather turns a little ruff. They also have rooms you walk right out to the pool on the first floor, oh ya the best part they have a \"HOT TUB< small but fun none the less. Daytona Beach Pier is a short walk north from the hotel , or you can drive it, the wife and I preffer to drive as walking is a little ruff for me.

It does not seem crowded here at all and we were surprised considering this is spring break for most. The room is clean and neat and the kitchen comes with everything you would need to cook with. They even gave us dishtowels, silverware and dishes/cups/glasses. They have a microwave, toaster, large coffeepot (12 cup) and cookware. The suite has two televisions, one in the livingroom and one in the bedroom area and yes, one of the tv's does have the needed jacks to plug in an XBox or PS3. The fold out bed in the livingroom is large enough for two adults to sleep in, so if you want to pile a few little ones in there, you could certainly do so. There is a guest laundry and vending in both the main building and the building with the suites, which is a blessing for families with kids. I would highly recommend bringing your own towels as there is never enough. Also, if you can get your hands on a beach chair and beach umbrella, bring it. They rent them on the beach, but why not have your own. I picked up a beach umbrella for about 10.00 and the local walgreens here sells the beach chairs for 10.00 each. There are daily activities for everyone here, including coloring and games for the little ones, bingo, shuffleboard, basketball hoop (shatterproof glass enclosed for everyone's safety--smart idea!) The beach is endless and is not crowded at all. You can drive your vehicle right onto the beach! If you do bring little ones, please watch them close because they may run into the path of a vehicle, motorcycle or dunebuggy. They go slow, but you just never know.

We stayed over Thanksgiving. First, I agree with many other reviewers- this place is dated. Our room was clean but....could use updating. Kitchen- provides dish soap, one dish towel- paper towels holder, but no paper towels. Fridge was clean. Stove was old, foil on the burners, but clean overall (we did not use during our stay). The staff was very accomodating. They were nice and eager to honor requests. I didn't realize the poolside cafe was seasonal which was a little disappointing, also we read the pool hours and my son was ready to do at 9:00 but the waterslide doesn't open until 10:00. We stayed during the turkey run so no fault to the motel staff- it was loud in the morning when the cars where heading off to the race track. In the early hours it seemed some of the cars were in our room as they were preparing to head to the track. Now- the reason that I was reluctant to review- my 12 yr old son and I believe our room was haunted. The first night I wrote off the weird happenings and the woman's voice I heard as a dream and a couple nights of not sleeping very well. However, when my son asked if I heard the woman after the second night, I knew it wasn't just my imagination. I don't believe in ghosts, but this experience has changed my beliefs. Due to the fact we were checking out that day, no need to change hotels. The presence wasn't harmful but there was definitely a presence. I read the place was once owned by a family from NY (1940's)- when I got back I researched if anyone else experienced anything weird ironically- another NY'er felt the presence- I don't know maybe somewhere back in time, something happened in that room and there is a relationship to NY- I wouldn't not stay because of this, I might however avoid this room- overall, the place is trying, it is clean, a few improvements could be beneficial.

I think the room was advertised at $150 per night and the room was definitely not worth that! Our room smelled funny when we entered (not the typical beach hotel smell, may have been coming from the air conditioner). We ended up buying 2 glade plug-ins (one for each room) and that helped tremendously. We also opened the windows to help with the smell and when we were closing them, they started to fall forward out of the track. After being plugged in for just a little while we didn't even notice the smell. The rooms were very spacious and pretty clean. The balcony has a regular door instead of a sliding door, which I couldn't prop open. There were 2 chairs and a small table on the balcony. The room seemed a little old but it appeared as though some of the rooms were being remodeled while we were there. We stayed on the 3rd floor which is the first floor that allows for oceanfront views because of the indoor pool. The view was very nice. If you are booking a room by the indoor pool you should know that it is pretty loud in that area even if there are not a lot of people down there because of the echo. I am not sure how loud it is in the rooms however. Also, there is nothing separating the 1st floor rooms from the pool area, so when you open your door you are standing in the pool area. This may be an issue for some travelers. The pools and grounds were very nice and there were plenty of chairs in the grass and around the pool area. The hotel staff was very nice and were seen about the property quite often. There was plenty of parking and it was all near the entrance. There were lots of activities for kids including contests and games. The food at the cafe was pretty good although at times they got a little busy and there was a bit of a wait, because there was only one person working. The prices were a little high, but not bad considering the convenience. The beach in front of the hotel was very nice, and is a part of the beach where driving is allowed. It is in a quieter section of town so there wasn't much traffic on the beach or on the road.

Condos are mostly vacant and the homeless are everywhere. Taking your kids to the boardwalk? Make sure you have them back to the hotel before dark. We had swearing screaming adults threatening violence in our proximity and decided it was past time to leave. We couldn't have scrambled fast enough! If you have the choice - go to Clearwater Beach on the Tampa side or even St. Augustine if you must stay in this general area. Biggins topless bar is across the street giving you a good idea of the class of the area. This side of the beach is more quiet than the boardwalk area - but I think that all the smarter people chose to stay elsewhere (Hilton for instance) - hence the reason for the quiet. On to the Lodge critique - yes - it's not been updated since at least the 80's - mauve decor, brown particle board doors, seriously old appliances in the kitchen along with so many cosmetic patching needs. We overlooked the indoor pool area and it felt very 70's with all the plants growing into the balcony so there was no view except for these palm plants which were in serious need of a pruning.

When they called Sun Viking she informed the staff of my situation and they agreed to provide us with a 25% discount and did not charge us the higher weekend rate as we checked in on Saturday. When I arrived at the Sun Viking I found that it was American Owned and Operated, very friendly staff, everyone spoke english. The office was very clean and very packed. Many people checking in. I reached the front desk to find the that the person who checked me it was the one who already knew of my situation. He was very friendly. After check in he handed me two coloring books with crayons for the kids and a free beach towel. We went to our room which was awesome, very clean, very big, with a full kitchen and the bathroom had two vanities, one in the bathroom and one outside the bathroom. Good size ocean front balcony. We stayed on the 4th floor. Elevators were very accessible. Laundry room right outside our door. Very family oriented. Each day the lodge had activities that were for the families. We played Bingo every day, did the Water balloon toss, adverteasing, card games, scavenger hunt.... The kids LOVED the waterslide. This place offered so much that we really didnt' have to leave and pay extra for activities. There was a Winn Dixie a few blocks up the road where we bought groceries for the week. The kids loved the Viking Cafe for lunch! My 5 year old loved the Cheeseburger and my 10 year old loved the cheese fries! The staff was very friendly and the guests have been coming there for many years. It was small enough to get to know the other guests but big enough to enjoy your own space. The beach access was wonderful. There is volleyball net on the beach, shuffleboard, two game rooms, an indoor pool and outdoor pool. This is the BEST experience we have ever had on a family vacation.

My husband, daughter, and I were vacationing with my 3 siblings and their families so cost was one of the primary focuses when looking for a place to stay. My husband and I typically stay at Hilton owned hotels because I have been a diamond club member for several years, so I had already decided that as long as the room was clean, I would just deal with the \"motel\" atmosphere that I do not typically stay at (I know that sounds snobby, but I truly do not mean it that way...I traveled for work for several years and just became accustomed to larger chain hotels). When I pulled in, I could tell the Sun Viking was an older, smaller establishment and just kept my fingers crossed that the rooms were clean. They were actually pretty nice! It looks like they have been updated in the last couple of years (nothing fancy, but certainly much better than expected!) and had some great amenities! We booked 2 - two room suites so there were 4 adults in each room, 3 kids in one and 2 kids in the other and I didn't feel like we were cramped at all! The \"Murphy\" bed was soooo much better than having to deal with a pull-out sofa and very easy to use. The hotel has an activities director who makes announcements reminding everyone they have 5 minutes before an upcoming event (bingo, basketball toss, face painting, sandcastle building, etc). My husband and I both remarked that it felt like we had a \u201ccruise director\u201d!! The hotel even had a grill you could reserve for free each night and provided the cooking utensils! The outdoor pool was a little small, but there were 2 of them which was nice in case you need to get out of the sun. The slide was awesome and they did a pretty decent job monitoring the kids coming down on top of each other. That one I blame more on parents who weren\u2019t paying attention to their kids though. The only complaint I have about the pool is that there are signs stating no smoking in the pool area which several people disregarded. It would have been nice if the employee monitoring the slide and pool had asked them to go to a smoking area. They were sitting within a few feet of the baby pool and the breeze was blowing the smoke directly towards the big pool...definitely not what I wanted to inhale at 6 1/2 months pregnant with my 17 month old daughter right there. I could have said something to the pool attendant or the front desk, but I hate to be \u201cthat person\u201d. It only happened the last day, so I just put up with it and tried not to breathe too deeply. One thing to note is that parking is very limited here. There is only 1 parking spot allotted per room, which we did not know before booking. As I mentioned, 2 families were sharing rooms so we obviously had 4 vehicles total. Apparently, when you book through Expedia, as we did, you are not made aware of all hotel policies. The front desk clerk, Larry??, was nice about it though. The hotel was not extremely busy so we just had to check with him to make sure there were still enough spaces on site. There is an overflow lot across the street, but luckily we did not have to use it. I think if we go back there, we will just check into renting a 15 passenger van so we don\u2019t have that problem!!

The hotels are either gone and replaced by condos or vacant lots. The only amusements are mini golf, the go karts are gone. Half of the gift shops are closed because empty condos don't bring customers. Boardwalk at ocean walk is a joke. Fifteen dollars for 3 peolpe to ride a ferris wheel is not family friendly. I don't know why people would go to the beach to go inside to a movie but really there isn't much else to do other than eat.

This year however there were six of us going and the old hotel could not give us a reasonable rate on two rooms, so we ventured into the unknown. After reading some reviews about the lodge we decided to give it a try. There are some bad reviews about the hotel on this site but what stood out to us is the way the management took their time to address the bad reviews and accepted both the good and bad criticism. We stayed from June 19- June 25 and had room 806 which was an ocean front with two queen beds and a pull out bed. There was a kitchenette with all the items you would expect ie; toaster, pots,pans,silverware,cutting board, tea kettle etc. Each room had a television in it with cable. The beds were not the most modern but they slept well. I even slept on the pullout a couple nights and it was not as bad as I thought it would be. The bathroom looked to be a bit more updated then the reast or the room.The balcony view was amazing overlooking the ocean. The property consisted of an indoor pool with waterfall, outdoor pool with slide, and a hot tub gazebo. There was also plenty of lounge chairs availble at all times of the day. The pools did get a little crowded in the early noon but we just went to the ocean during that time. We found ourselves alone in the pools many times around 5 or 6. There are two game rooms, nothing real fancy. Two laundry rooms. A computer room with internet and a printer availible. A workout room was also availble. The daily activities were funf for the kids and the staff was great with them. Overall this was a great experience for our family. This is not forsomeone who expects the most up to date or posh lodging. This is aimed towards families with kids. It was well worth our money and we will return.

There is a little cafe that we did not eat at, but everyone seemed to enjoy. There are organized activities for the kids, and of course, the ocean!

I also think they have excellent customer service and are very friendly. They keep the hotel rooms clean and I appreciate that but at this this point it just needs a renovation. The room I stayed in was very outdated. The kitchen literally had plaid green wallpaper from the 70's. The beds, pillows, and sheets are old. The bedspread is the old polyester floral type and there is no blanket...just a white sheet and the polyester bedspread.

Lots of activities for kids and families *Beach is right there and easily accessible *The rooms are SUPER CLEAN...always nice to see at a beach hotel Now for the cons: *I'd classify this more of a motel than a hotel really. The room we had was very musty smelling and without a balcony, there was no way to air it out. It was also quite dated. I tried to stay out of the room as much as possible b/c it was a bit depressing. *A/C - either toooooo cold or toooooo warm...no inbetween *The fight for a beach chair begins early - forget about getting one near the pool if you get up after 9AM. And there's NO shade at any of the loungers. An attempt to move a lounger into the shade that bounces off the palm trees after 2PM is a feat of amazing strength, since the chairs on the grass are chained together in groups of four *The nickel and diming is extrodinary. Pay for the safes. Pay for an extra room key. Pay for local calls. I was very surprised by this. Overall, I'd say that as long as your expectations are not high, this is a fine place to stay. The Hyatt Regency it is not (of course I would imagine the price tag would reflect this). I will say that our room was reserved by our family members who vacation here 2x/year for the past 20 years. Honestly, given the business they've done with the Sun Viking over the years, I'd have anticipated them getting something better than the WORST two rooms at the resort. 1st floor, facing the elevator shaft and stairwell.

After breakfast we wandered to the outdoor pool, which had a waterslide. I felt like I was 5 years old again - and loved every minute of it. When we heard that our room was ready (announced at the pool) we were almost upset about going in!. The room was beautiful, very very clean and smelled like coconut tanning oil - a favorite of mine. The kitchenette came in very handy for the week we were down there; it was a nice change to be able to make some sandwiches or breakfast some days and save a little money, (new family & on a slight budget). The evenings were perfect, most kids had gone inside already and a quiet romantic walk on the beach was wonderful. Spending 30 minutes in the hot tub before bed was also a great way to unwind. In the morning everything was sprayed down, very neat and clean outside - no garbage on that part of the beach either! The hotel is literally 20 feet from the ocean - it is breathtakingly beautiful from the bedroom balcony!! I had a quiet romantic trip, and cannot wait to come back with my kids. It may not be the place for 21 year olds to meet other singles but it is perfect for mid to late 20's couples and new families, as well as established families with a lot of kids.

It was terrific, despite the weather. It was just DH and I, and we were very impressed with the hotel and the employees. We both wish we'd been to a place like this when we were kids! Let me start with check-in. Because we were staying more than 3 nights, we got all kinds of freebies. What a nice surprise! We walked out of the office with our arms full. Nice touch! Our room, in the tower, was a surprise too. It obviously had not just been painted and redone, but it certainly looked it if you didn't look too close. It's obvious it's well cleaned and maintained. Usually in beachside motels/hotels, there are things I don't want to touch. I know it's the corrosion from the salt air and hard to keep up with, but it's gross. I'm used to spending a week walking careful so as not to rub against bathroom and kitchen parts. Not so at the Sun Viking. I think it's their ventilation system or the AC or both. Either way, though we were on the 7th of 8 floors and should have been dripping in humidity, we actually had bathing suits dry overnight in the bathroom! It was such a pleasant delight-- I've been to places where 3 days after wearing a suit it was still damp! I don't know where to begin with the other details. It was nice to have a place to go in the hotel where we could get breakfast or lunch. It was a good option, especially breakfast! Plenty of tables around in various places too. Really loved the indoor HEATED pool wiht the waterfall. How nice to have that option the 2 days it was rainy and windy (too windy for the beach). It is cleaned every morning, and despite what someone else said about being over-chlorinated, I didn't find that to be the case and I am very chlorine-sensitive. Someone else said the pools were small. When we were there, there were a lot of families on the 2 weekends (not during the week) and although one day the outside pool was slightly crowded, I was still able to swim around while DH enjoyed the slide over and over and over. We could have gone to the indoor pool where only one other couple were, but wanted to enjoy the sun. Btw, our first night we shared the indoor pool with another couple and at least 7 or 8 kids. I don't think any of us felt cramped, although there was a clear respect for everyone's space. Speaking of kids-- my husband and I often felt like kids in a candy store. What to do? Indoor pool? Outdoor pool? Hot tub? Ocean? Beach walk? Shuffleboard? Mini-Golf across the street? We spent one entire day in our swimsuits just running from one thing to the next at the hotel. It was great fun in between our sightseeing. We never did get our act together enough to get in on the bingo games, breezeway bowling and the other activities scheduled at the Sun Viking. We look forward to better planning next spring when we visit again. Oh, I almost forgot to mention this. I finally got my first jellyfish sting. Naturally, i couldn't remember what to use on it, so while coming up from the beach I decided to try asking the lifeguard at the outdoor pool. She handed me a spray bottle with vinegar and water in it to spray on the stings and told me if I needed more that it was right behind the counter. I did need more later (after she was gone) and had no problem getting it. I thought it was so very nice to have that handy like that. Haven't seen anything like that in all the other nice places I've stayed! In fact, the ones who have mentioned jellyfish in their information packages suggest going to the grocery store to get vinegar. I have to comment on the employees. Everyone was always so friendly and with a smile, asking the guests if they were enjoying their stay and was there anything they could do for us. It wasn't forced-- they seemed to be very happy working there and they seemed genuine in wanting to make everyone's stay a happy one. I mentioned earlier how clean the rooms were-- the grounds were too. Every morning early, there was a crew cleaning up, and someone was always around during the day seeing to things. This was completely different from my other experiences at other places. The truth of the matter is that our lovely room at the Sun Viking was about $25 more a night than the \"bargain\" place we'd been staying in Daytona Beach. It was completely worth it. The difference between that other place (I'll leave it nameless) with it's sometimes not working elevators, dim lights, non-working lamps in rooms, cramped bathrooms with corroded fixtures, damp rooms, indoor carpets that get wet and stay wet when it rains, one cold pool that is never cleaned the entire week, no activities, a cafe that is only open a few hours in the morning, grumpy staff, lots of noise and an overall sense of dilapidation. I LOVED having a bathroom mirror with a light overhead that didn't leave me wondering if my makeup was streaked or not. We loved having two sinks (each with its own mirror and lighting). I really just loved having everything looking clean and fresh. Oh, I can't believe I almost forgot this-- REAL DISHES AND UTENSILS! Our room had a full kitchen. The dishes were corelle (SMART move-- takes a LOT to break/chip them-- I know, they are the only dish I'll have in my house!). The utensils were not some cheap light set purchased at Kmart or worse. They were mid-weight and a pleasure to use. I'd even brought a knife with me because usually there isn't one, but Sun Viking had a very nice one in the room. And get this-- an ICE MAKER in the fridge! These little things... all week long we kept coming up with little things that did make a big difference in the enjoyment of our visit, and they were worth the $25 more per night. Add in the big things, and we felt we got quite the bargain at Sun Viking. Thanks Sun Viking!

But if you want a wholesome beach experience, and the reassurance of an indoor and an outdoor heated pool, this is the place for you. My son has been to five star resorts in florida, the caribbean and bahamas, and given the choice he would choose the sun viking.", "Date": "March 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201c2005 Spring Break Dissappointment\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3289232", "Content": "I had read several reviews before booking our weeks stay at the Sun Viking. About 95% of them were great, which leads me to believe that the owners probably wrote the reviews themselves. We were so disappointed in this hotel. The beds were very uncomfortable. We would have slept on the floor if we thought that it would have been clean enough. They pride themselves on being family oriented. Every night before going to bed I had to literally put two chairs in front of the door because I was so scared that my four year old would get up in the middle of the night and walk out of the room. The locks on the doors were not high enough to ensure the safety of all of its guests. The security was very poor. We had to call the front desk several times because of the people outside our door at 10:30 p.m. cursing, laughing, slamming doors, and bumping walls. We were told that someone would be walking around in a couple of minutes to quiet things down. This happened at least three of the five nights that we were there. The walls are very thin. You could hear the televisions of the people next door. When you look on the website or at a brochure, you see rooms that appear to be very big. Don\u2019t let them fool you. They are very tiny. We stayed in plan #2. This was supposed to be a side view of the ocean. Ha Ha! There was no ocean view. They also have a safe in the room, if you want to pay 50 cents every time you use it, that\u2019s great. They even charge you to make a local call. They do not have a fire extinguisher in the room. You have to share it with all of the other \u201csuckers\u201d that are paying $175.00 and upward a night. We were expecting great things out of this hotel and got less than mediocrity. We would not recommend this hotel at all and we will never return. I hope that this helps someone from making the same mistake that we did.", "Date": "March 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cSun Viking since 1989\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2699255", "Content": "We have been staying at the Sun Viking for vacations since the eight story building was built in 1989.

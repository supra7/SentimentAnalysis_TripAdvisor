Our rate was a total with tax of $102/night due to the convention. It appears they are usually $50-60/night.) Our gorgeous new Holiday Inn Express rooms traveling to Indy were $115/night. The hotel itself gives the appearance of being quite old-- 1960's maybe? Carpets in our rooms are fairly worn and the rooms in general are simply dingy. The grounds are clean as is the hotel itself. Upon entering our room from a fresh smelling hallway, the smell of smoke was evident. My floor was not a smoking floor. It got worse and we told the front desk about it. Despite the best of intentions, it absolutely was NOT addressed the next day as we were told it had been. Three of the rooms in our group did not have the beds made either. There was not a single item left on the bed in two of the rooms, one had a trundle bed in the way apparently, but all three rooms were noted as having the rooms completely done on the cleaning sheets that the front desk gets. Unnecessary. The towels were replaced and the garbage emptied in all. Day two our beds were made and the smoke smell virtually gone, but it did return as the week went on. The Internet was nearly impossible to connect to, even when most rooms were empty in mid-day. It also dropped easily. The rooms did have a microwave, small fridge, ironing board and iron. The power strip didn't seem the safest and was under the bed, and they lacked plugs anywhere near the computer desk for a laptop. While I may be swayed by the high price we paid for this hotel, I have balanced it out by leaving an \"average\" rating rather than \"poor\". The people working here both last year and this were all very kind and helpful (except when the cleaning was inadequate). The breakfast is good, quite standard now, but they kept up well with so many guests. The fact that smoking is still allowed in hotels is amazing to me. Having the first floor as a smoking floor only lets the smell rise. Walking through the first floor to use the stairs is like being in the bowels of hell. I feel horrible for the cleaning people who must be in that atmosphere. Truly, this hotel would not be on any list of hotels I'd recommend. I hesitate to stay in a place with such a low normal rate as it isn't ever what we want. But the people who work there are the only reason I would say give it a chance. They are very welcoming and try hard to help you enjoy your stay.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cTrip to Indy with FFA\u201d", "Author": "1964Denise", "ReviewID": "UR119603223", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a student convention with my son and other parents and students.

The driver's side window was shattered and the criminal took a GPS mount that was on my dash. My GPS was in my room, but the other guest's were taken. The front desk clerk called the cops. Upon questioning, she told me that no video surveillance or security was available outside. Also, when I asked for a vaccuum for help with removing glass from my car, she paged a man that gave me a little broom and a dustpan. At this time, it began to rain and snow. No further help was offered. When I asked for help finding a glass service, I was told there was a phone book in my room! The service and security at this hotel are way below average. If you choose to stay here, make sure you hide anything valuable or even related to a GPS. I know I wish I would have known about the \"common\" activity.

Room was clean and not smelly, beds comfortable, bathroom was clean, parking easy, service was good, breakfast was just ok (I had a weak waffle, pastries, fruit, coffee).

It was a good decision; the rooms are clean, the clientele was pretty considerate (seemed to be mostly couples and families), and the front desk staff was polite and efficient. I had a room facing the parking lot, which was a little noisy when the window was open, but with the window closed very little sound penetrated into the room. The bathroom was very clean, the amenities smelled nice without being too perfumey, and the water pressure was quite good. The coffee downstairs was decent, the free breakfast was pretty carb-heavy, but did offer fruit and yogurt so you didn't have to eat the waffles or donuts or bagels unless you wanted to. The entire second floor is for nonsmokers; if you have a very sensitive nose, you can tell that someone elsewhere in the hotel had smoked at some point in time, but the whiff I caught was so faint and momentary that it was almost instantly forgotten, and was certainly nothing that would bother even the highly allergic.

Additionally, I found the building to be in great shape, considering it was a little older. Our room was clean, as well as the pool area, and breakfast area were well taken care of and stocked. It's in a great part of town with lots to do. There's a Ruby Tuesday, Texas Roadhouse, Famous Dave's, Denny's, Cracker Barrel all within walking distance or so. Just east on 465 there are some shopping centers/malls (or just go east down 86th Street) or go either way on Michigan Road and you'll find a Walmart and Super Target. We were extremely glad we stayed in this area and this hotel specifically. We were able to still enjoy some of what Indianapolis offered downtown (by just going west and south on 465 to 65 south to the Children's Museum and Indianapolis Zoo). The zoo is GREAT by the way, as well as the Children's Museum.

I believe the hotel portion of the trip was around $65.00, which was well worth it. My flight arrived early and I called the hotel to get an ealry checkout due to so many late checkouts from a wedding and family reunion. No problem, since I had rental car (Dollar @IND, great cars price and service). I had my own navigation system with me so we found the Fashion Outlet Mall and some other shopping centers, that were great places to waste time. Upon returning to the hotel at 2:00pm, our room was ready and everything was as expected. The rooms were clean, and well kept. Furnishings were as expected, and none were broken, ripped, etc. We had a room with a balcony, that overlooked the pool and rear \"courtyard\", so it was great not to be facing a parking lot. Breafast in the morning was clean and well organized. The offerings were boiled eggs, bagles, muffins, waffles, fruits, cereals, juices, coffee and tea. The hotels is in the Pyramids Office Park, which was probably quite becuase of the weekend. There are plenty fast food and family restaurants (Famous Dave's BBQ, McD, Taco Bell, Denny's, Chick Fila, Wendy's, Panda Chinese and Cracker Barrel) all within a mile of the hotel.

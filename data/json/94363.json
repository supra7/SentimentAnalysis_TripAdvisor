We had dinner in the restaurant; the menu had nice selections and service was good. It was difficult to find a parking space and we left the car way out back. The lot was well-lit. There was quite a crowd for the Saturday early morning shuttles and they did fill up. Within ten minutes, we were dropped off at the terminal.

The walls were thinner than usual, as I could hear the couple in the next room with too much clarity. The restaurant needs particular attention. It is pretty dark and shabby looking. behind the bar their bottles consist of about 6 different liquors lined up in a row. Despite there being only about 6 people at the bar, I waited about 5 minutes before getting the bartender's attention. She was very busy talking with another waiter. The food I ordered there was actually pretty good. So all in all this was an average stay, but the hotel needs attention and the restaurant needs an upgrade and better hiring practices As other reviews have stated, it is located in an industrial area so there is not much in the area as alternatives for eating.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Britain, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cquick layover\u201d", "Author": "Jake N", "ReviewID": "UR125651871", "Content": "I had a seminar the next morning so instead of trying to avoid traffic going to boston in the morning, i decided to get there early and spent the night.

After about 25 minutes of waiting at the correct pickup location, diligently watching for the van, still no shuttle so I called again (and the phone rang 15 times before someone answered) and was told it would be just another 5 minutes. Twelve minutes later, still no shuttle, so I called again . . . then at that point the shuttle finally showed up.

Water, cups, and towels provided at the fitness center. - Friendly and efficient front desk staff . . . same for restaurant staff . . . I had forgotten my toothbrush and was cheerfully given a complimentary one. - Fresh cookies at the front desk during the evening - Spacious lobby good for meeting colleagues (e.g., to go over the presentation one last time), though some electrical outlets in the lobby would be nice. - Much more affordable than comparable lodging in downtown Boston . . . and really not too hard to get to/from downtown using the hotel's shuttle in concert with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (subway). Cons: - There is really nothing at all within walking distance of the property . . . the neighborhood is rental car lots, warehouses, and industrial facilities strung along an unwalkable busy highway. No restaurants, not even fast food, no convenience stores, no nothing. So if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a rental car, you are kind of hostage to the hotel restaurant for your meals unless you want to go through the hassle of taking the (free) hotel shuttle to the T station and then riding the T to a more happenin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 neighborhood. - Limited TV channel selection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no MSNBC, no Comedy Central. - Breakfast buffet was lame and overpriced as is usually the case at mid-tier hotels. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to have hotel restaurant profit margins. - Desk/ work area was kind of small\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 not much space from front to back of desk (which was really just a counter up against the wall). - Common areas like hallways and elevator lobbies are looking worn. - There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wee bit of airport noise, but insufficient to bother all but the most sensitive sleepers Neither pro nor con but potentially relevant - The hotel seems to be very popular with airline crews and in fact has a dedicated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crew lounge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brickell, Florida", "Title": "\u201cMeets Marriott basic standards\u201d", "Author": "Miamifun_9", "ReviewID": "UR120954115", "Content": "The hotel offers complimentary shuttle services which are very reliable.

The buffet was tiny and to suggest that the food was rewarmed was generous since most of it was no better than room temperature.

The overall cost of lodging is more readily factored in to travel plans. Location, however, can be something of a wild card affecting a overall travel budget in unexpectedly kind and not-so-kind ways. If easy access to the many attractions which a city provides is high on the priority list, one shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overlook the fact that there are many ways to get to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where the action is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the same amount of time. The best or most efficient route is not always from the urban core. Reasonably priced accommodations which might be slightly off the beaten path are sometimes overlooked in an effort to be in the heart of a city. And that would be true when planning a trip to Boston. What \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonably priced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means will vary of course from traveler to traveler. For cost-conscious leisure travelers, this notion could mean relishing a hostel experience; staying at the YMCA; putting up with some minor annoyances and a lack of amenities in quaint, unique or boutique lodging offerings which often dot a city; or even staying at a 3 star hotel as opposed to a 4 star facility. When considering the vast range of lodging options available in Boston, it is definitely wise to scrutinize on-line traveler reviews and a street map alike for lodging possibilities. Marriott is a nationally recognized reputable hotel chain, and it operates hotels in several different Boston locations. Rates for these hotels are consistent with the level of services expected of higher-end hostelries. However, budget-minded travelers who are nevertheless willing to pay a few dollars above the discount rate structure for overnight lodging but not face post-travel bankruptcy proceedings following stays at such star-spangled hotels, one might consider the Marriott Courtyard at Logan Airport located approximately 1 mile north of Boston. The Marriott Courtyard doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boast a tony in-city brass door knocker neighborhood address but is instead situated in the urban environs of Boston. What it does have going for it is excellent access to the airport and to Boston via the transit (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) train station. Such convenience is arguably well worth the extra dollars spent to stay at the Courtyard. The hotel runs a 24 hour call-request shuttle bus from the hotel to both the airport and the train station. Once deplaned and with baggage claimed, simply call the hotel to request a pickup. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle bus will pick hotel guests up at the designated traffic island outside Logan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s baggage claim area promptly. Wait times rarely exceed 15 minutes. The drivers are courteous and will assist passengers with loading and unloading baggage onto and from the vehicle. The same service is extended to guests wishing to be picked up at the train station after a day spent exploring the city. A $1 per bag tip to the driver is not excessive and an appreciated gesture. The drivers definitely earn any such gratuities considering their punctuality, pleasant demeanor, assistance with luggage and ease in navigating the busy traffic flow of both highway and the airport. The complimentary shuttle bus ride takes generally about five minutes from hotel to airport or train station depending on the volume of passengers. And, when considering the stress that early morning departure flights from Logan Airport can sometimes cause, there is much to be said for the peace of mind which arises from taking the shuttle bus from the Courtyard. Hop aboard with fellows travelers, business folks, and airline pilots and flight attendants and leave the driving to the hotel. The Mariott Courtyard is a nearly 250 room twelve storied hotel. The facility has been nicely upgraded from past hotel ownership. Most rooms have commanding cityscape views of Boston, harbor communities, and the urban areas adjacent to the hotel. The lobby is spacious and attractively decorated and appointed. Facilities on the first floor include the registration desk manned by courteous and professional staff, a full service restaurant and lounge, reception area chairs and sofas, and a business work area outfitted with wired workstations, wireless internet service, and fax and printer. Located near the elevators are a complimentary coffee and tea beverage station, a bank of monitors to assist with airport boarding passes and an ATM cash dispensing machine. Glass front coolers with beverages and snacks for purchase are located steps away from the front desk. My guest room featured two clean and comfortable Queen-sized beds, a well illuminated desk with combination bureau drawers, closet (armoire) space, a wide panel remote controlled television, and wireless access for computer lap-toppers. The bathroom while not overly large was nevertheless bright, clean, decorated in a neutral color palette, stocked daily with an ample supply of towels, and included a toilet and tub-shower combination with excellent water pressure and quick response temperature control. A well-lit mirror sink area with the requisite complimentary toiletries (soap, shampoo etc.) faced the bathroom. Electrical appliances included a hair dryer and coffee-pot setup within arm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reach of the sink area. The room provided no basis for complaint at all during my four nights stay. On the first night I was aware of flights taking off and landing at Logan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distant runways which were visible from the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s windows, but that to-be-expected airport noise signature quickly disappeared into the background from the second night onward. Even the sound of elevators in transit based on my room's close proximity to the elevator foyer also dissipated from awareness. The lobby level houses a restaurant and lounge which was a spacious, nicely designed setting offering a breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. A menu board for the various meals and dining times was positioned at the head of the stairs and carpeted ramp leading to the restaurant area. Prices were not cheap but were commensurate with other better Boston restaurants. The only meal which I ate at the hotel during my stay was the well-tended breakfast buffet. The buffet items were varied, attractively presented and very tasty. Although the cost for the buffet was more than I am accustomed to spending for breakfast in the midwest, the ease of starting the day off with a leisurely hearty breakfast right within the hotel was in my estimation well worth the additional expense. Wait staff were attentive and courteous. Most of the comfortable booths seemed to have individual wall-mounted, remote controlled TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the convenience of diners. There is an outdoor pool on the hotel grounds but it was open for use during my visit. If convenience in accessing Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many attractions and reasonably priced comfort are high on your travel agenda, then the Courtyard Marriott at Logan Airport is a very sensible option to consider when making plans to visit one of New England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s must-see destinations.

Up to 10 days of free parking plus airport shuttle service!\u201d", "Author": "Karascorner", "ReviewID": "UR39593076", "Content": "We (my boyfriend and I of 7yrs) stayed here in room #730 only one night, August 26-27th 2009, after flying home late on August 26th to Boston from a 5 night stay on Grand Bahama Island. Since our return flight was coming in late at night, we figured we'd stay here one night before driving home to Connecticut the following day. As a Marriott Member, I booked the \"Park & Dine\" package which got us our room for the night plus 10 days of free parking and a $50 food and beverage credit to the on site Bistro restaurant for a total of $201.29 after taxes and fees. Which is a decent bargain given that just 6 days of parking alone would have cost us around $90 with other vendors, not to mention the added $50 food credit, so we figured our one night really only cost us $61.29 (but we earnt points on the full rate, whereas if the parking and food was done separately we would not have received points on those!). POSITIVES: Parking at the hotel was free during our stay and free while we were in the Bahamas, BUT that was ONLY because it was an included perk for using the promo code I did when I booked our stay. Otherwise, parking would have been a $14 a day (while we were not a guest there) but it's free for the nights that you do stay there. The parking lot is patrolled by security. We saw the security vehicle making its route around the parking lot while we waited for the airport shuttle to arrive. The staff for the airport shuttle (the shuttle service is free!) was very friendly and pretty much on-time whenever we were quoted waiting times. When we needed to be picked up, all I did was call the front desk and tell them what airway we were flying and then from there we waited by the green marked section at the airport to flag down the driver. I should note that their white shuttle van is clearly marked with the \"Courtyard\" logo with \"Logan Airport\" underneath so you know you're getting into the right shuttle (see my photo). The hotel has a mini-market on the main floor with a decent variety of personal care products and food products like sandwiches, frozen dinners, ice cream, cookies, crackers, etc... Just be aware that convenience comes with a price. The woman who checked us in on August 26th was very friendly--although I did have to remind her about the $50 food credit we were supposed to receive as part of our package. The bathroom was clean and somewhat larger than other Courtyard's we have stayed at. The sink was actually in the bathroom, not outside of it and there was a large amount of counter space. The shower head was adjustable so that you could change the type of spray and whether it was high or low pressure. It also took little to no time at all for the water to heat up. There was a decent size flat screen LCD TV in the room. There were blackout curtains as well as window sheers. I've stayed at other places that didn't have black-out curtains and to me these are a necessity. I need darkness when I sleep, so if I get woken up by the slightest noise in the morning I need to know that the sun won't keep me from falling back asleep. Noise? None really. I didn't hear any planes the whole night and the only thing I did hear was the thermostat whirring as our room was not near an ice machine or elevator. The food at the Bistro restaurant for lunch was decent and the waitress was friendly. To use up our $50 credit we both got the full rack of baby back ribs and some drinks. The ribs were tasty even though they weren't slathered with BBQ sauce like I normally prefer. Its location is very convenient to the highway. It's right outside the hotel. We were lucky to miss a lot of the traffic caused by Ted Kennedy's death and the service going on in Boston August 27th while we were headed home. NEGATIVES: We arrived at about 3am the morning on August 21, 2009 to use our parking credit prior to our stay and use the complimentary airport shuttle to bring us to the airport. The guy at the front desk seemed very confused about the package we had booked and didn't understand that we were flying first, and then staying. After about 15 minutes of confusion on his part, we were finally waiting 15 minutes again for the airport shuttle to pick us up. Surely we could not have been the first people to use an airport parking package offered at this hotel, as there were plenty of cars in the lot with parking passes hanging from the rear-view mirrors when we arrived. I'm a member of Marriott Rewards and only one of my requests was fulfilled (which was a high floor). I requested extra foam pillows, there were none. The refrigerator? Non existent, there wasn't one in the room. The extra towels? We only received 1 extra. The hotel mini-market, again, even though I mentioned some of it as a positive. There was no price list posted that I could see for the food items. As I mentioned before, convenience does come with a price... just 2 ice cream Drumsticks and a Tollhouse cookie ice cream sandwich cost us about $15! The in-room temperature control unit was pretty dated. Our room was pretty cold when we arrived so we tried to turn up the heat and the musty burning smell that resulted was so gross I decided to freeze rather than get sick from smelling that. The bathroom, again, even though I mentioned some of it as a positive... The shower head seemed like it was positioned a little lower than it ought to be. I'm 5'5\" and the shower head was only up a couple inches higher than me. Someone taller than me could easily hit their head on it if they aren't paying attention, or someone even taller might have to hunch over to wash their face and hair. OVERALL: Would we stay here if we were NOT flying out of Boston and needed parking? No, but if we were then we would with the parking package again. And I'd also recommend it BUT ONLY WITH THE PARKING PACKAGE to anyone who needs 6-10 days of paid parking while they fly as their price is a value (which is the only reason why I gave it 5*'s for value). Otherwise, if you don't need the parking, then I don't see any value in staying here whatsoever. There are better places. Would I recommend this place to tourists driving to Boston? No, it's not close or convenient to anything they would probably plan on visiting, and the tolls once you get into Boston are ridiculous for this area (But hey! That's Taxachusetts for you!). I'm not sure I'd recommend it to tourists flying here either.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "iceland", "Title": "\u201cWorst Marriott hotel I have stayed at.\u201d", "Author": "guag", "ReviewID": "UR39001489", "Content": "Negattiv: Not according to Marriott standard.

After three days they had still failed to move the diet drinks from a back fridge to the main fridge. Front desk staff were more interested in doing paper work than handling customers or seemed to be exceptionally cavalier about how they interacted. The rooms were set up for linking laptop to flat screen for presentation dry runs, similar to wha they have in some of the more advanced courtyards in the Bay area - but they did not have any of the lines - you are expected to bring your own in this facility. One good thing is internet is free - more than I can say for most courtyards. The location, while close to the airport, requires some strangle u-turns and freeway exit ramps. Not straightforward if you are going in multiple directions during your stay. The restaurant is mediocre - though having well meaning staff. The one jewel is that you can take a back road to a small neighborhood that is at the end of one of the Logan runways, separated by freeways and water and cut through by train tracks. It is a little community with a few restaurants and well kept houses and yards, once you get off the main street - great if you like to get out of your room for a walk.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for a quick stay\u201d", "Author": "GEOFFS3", "ReviewID": "UR30635321", "Content": "I had a quick stay here on a Thursday night. For a short airport stay, it was perfect. There is really less to say than more. The Location: If you need to be near the airport, this is perfect. It's a 5-minute ride. If you need to be closer to downtown.....well you may not be no hot on the location. To access public transportation, you can ride the hotel shuttle back to the airport and catch the T. The Vibe: This used to be a Holiday Inn until it renovated and re-branded. It doesn't appear or feel like a Courtyard at all......until you are inside. On the outside, you can tell it was a Holiday Inn. The Room: Pretty much standard Courtyard. The bedding was awesome. Flat panel TV, large desk, and a spot to plug in all your wires. My king room had a small couch and coffee table. Otherwise unremarkable. My Gripe: Some of the old Holiday Inn branding still appears in spots. The location certainly is not fabulous, but this is an airport property. Sum it up: Met my expectations for a courtyard.

The address does not show up on my $800.00 Automobile Navigation system. This hotel looks like Marriott Courtyard on the outside and has a nice lobby but the rooms are more like Holiday Inn/Motel 6. Location is in an industrial part of town. Rooms are oddly shaped. LCD TV but no Pay per view and not a lot of channels. I don't get it. Promises High speed internet but it's Wi-fi and this traveller could not get a good signal and gave up. Space age coffee maker that makes one cup at a time and does not allow you to bre your own coffee. Starbucks is onsite but was closed when I arrived at 4.00 in the afternoon on a Thursday. Average bed. Heating is from a noisy \"Motel 6\" style heater that will keep you up all night if you leave it on, or you can just get cold. The door to my room has a problem with the lock. Onsite resturaunt/bar serves reasonable food at a high price, there is nothing else nearby and no sign of any information on local takeout taxi/other takeout in the room. I stayed there for one night on the last day of a trip to Boston. I just wanted to be near the airport but wish I had chosen a different hotel.

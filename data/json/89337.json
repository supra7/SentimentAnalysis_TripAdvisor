Here is a list of the problems: - The hotel (outside of the first floor lobby and bar) looks generally uncared for; doors and hallways have chipped paint, there are stains on the hallway carpets, it looks dingy and dirty, etc. - The water changed from scalding to freezing at times. This suggests a problem with the water heater. - There was a sewer gas smell emanating from the tub/toilet. - There was what appeared to be black mold in the bathroom ceiling (health hazard) - The room generally had a musty smell. - The tub flooded when being used for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Maintenance fixed it. - My toilet flushing mechanism broke (apparently while I was at work). Maintenance fixed it, but it never worked very well after that. - There were stains all over my room and on the chairs. - The bed was horribly uncomfortable. - The temp control was bad, the AC would freeze the whole room when on because the system was trying to drop the temperature one degree. - The cleaning staff did not always replace toilet paper or soap - The cleaning staff turned off my temp control when I went to DC for a weekend. They should not mess with the temperature when it is obvious that someone is still staying in the room (my suitcases and clothes were clearly visible). I set it at 74 degrees on Friday with the thermostat set to \u201con\u201d and returned to my room to be 80+ degrees with the thermostat set to \u201coff\u201d when I returned on Sunday. This really irked me; my employer paid for the room on my behalf (stayed there for over a month), therefore, I should be able to set the thermostat to any temperature I want and the room should be the same when I return. This shows that hotel management is cheap and that they instruct employees to try and save money at the occupant\u2019s expense. This is pennywise but pound foolish. - There are no garbage cans in the hallway by the elevators. Try eating a can of tuna and then trying to locate a garbage can to dispose of it so that your whole room doesn\u2019t smell like tuna. - The \u201chigh speed\u201d internet was painfully slow. - My jacket disappeared from the dining room. I forgot it in the hotel dining room and realized the next morning. I looked for it and asked staff if they found it the next morning, however, it was gone. It was my fault for forgetting the jacket, but usually staff sees that a guest left something behind, then they give it to the front desk. - Staff does not pick up the dry cleaning bag when you leave it in your room. Staff did not get dry cleaning back on time (supposed to be next day, but it was back in two and sometimes three days). They never put it in your room (like at most hotels). They do not replace the back and receipt when you use the one in your room. - The pool closes at noon on Sundays. Why have a pool if guests who are staying long term cannot even use it on one of their two non-work days per week? - Much of the cardio equipment in the \u201cgym\u201d is damaged. Weights mysteriously disappeared while we were staying there. I do not usually complain about these things, rather, I take them in stride. However, I feel that it is necessary to let people know how bad the Holiday Inn is. I have stayed at several of the Marriot hotels here in Baltimore for work, including the Renaissance, which was phenomenal (they took care of me even after my fridge exploded, leaking freon into my room). I stayed at the Holiday Inn two years ago and it was not nice then, but it has become horrible since. I do not ever want to stay at this hotel again. The Positives: 1) The front desk staff is very friendly 2) Michael the bartender is a phenomenal bartender, entertainer, and all around person. I spent many a night during my 32+ days at the hotel bar to break up the monotony of being in my room. The other bartender is subpar and square. Michael is funny, he always had a joke to cheer me up after long hours at work. He is extremely intelligent and a good conversationalist, we had some great discussions. He is a spectacular bartender, my drinks were always made right, were cold, and I never had to wait to get one (even when the bar was full). He made great suggestions about where to go, where to eat, and what to avoid in Baltimore. He is a great spokesman for the hotel and the city. If it wasn\u2019t for Mike, I don\u2019t know how I would have been able to deal with staying in the hotel. Kudos, thank you for everything Mike; who\u2019s better than you! Note to hotel staff: Give the guy a raise because he is the best bartender ever and makes your hotel bearable.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, close to baseball field.\u201d", "Author": "Loveroadtrip", "ReviewID": "UR127825170", "Content": "It is our second visit to this hotel.

Found this hotel on the web with a great rate. I will say that the front desk, house keeping, pool guard and bellman could not be any nicer or more helpful. Our room on the eighth floor was very clean, bright and well layout with two queen beds, sitting chair, desk chair with work area and a large LCD flat screen. That is where the good stuff ends. I think charging $23. to park as a guest when the public parking in the next lot was cheaper by far is just a rip off. Two cars, $46.. really? ugh. The beds in the room had a formed \"v\" in the matresses, not great for sleeping. 4 pillows on the bed, two firm, two soft, nice? sort of. They are only 1/2 pillows. Rollover in the night, you roll off the pillow.not so nice. The bath shower diverter was not working properly. The flow/volume of water coming out of the shower head was completely sub-standard. The LCD TV displayed only a few number of channels and displayed very poor viewing quality, It was a very nice, name brand TV and the worst picture from what appeared to be poor reception or bad hook ups. The pool is heated and indoors. Thats the good news. The bad news is the level of chlorine in the pool room was so high, it burned our throats. There is no reason for that high of a chlorine level in the pool room air, No pool for us. Morning brought no local newspaper to the room door and according to the front desk , none were available anywhere in the hotel. Upon leaving the room, we had to wait quite about 5-10 minutes for an elevator that had room for us. Only three elevators for guests and at peak times, they filled up pretty quick. We had fresh coffee and a muffin in the lobby coffee shop. I will say it safe and clean and fine for an over night stay with no plans to relax by the pool or in the hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Good Value\u201d", "Author": "GleefulTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR126049528", "Content": "I've stayed here twice before, and this site continues to live up to past experiences.

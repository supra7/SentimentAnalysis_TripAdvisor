Not good value for price paid, though.\u201d", "Author": "Luz1980", "ReviewID": "UR126341726", "Content": "The star of this hotel is the view. So you NEED to ask for a higher floor. Lower floors are probably loud. Let me start by saying that I keep in mind that NY accommodations are always more expensive than in other places, and the rooms in every hotel I\u00b4ve been to in NY are always so small you can\u00b4t even fit your luggage. So having said this, the Bentley has nicely sized rooms, at least I could see that at the Junior Suite. But the Bentley has a few issues that are easy to improve, and they shouldn\u00b4t be present in a +300 USD a night hotel. Let me point out some examples: Housekeeping: by far the worst part. The bathroom was not properly cleaned even once during our stay. Toiletries were never ever replaced. There was only one soap in the bathroom, which as soon as we arrived, we had to share for showering and washing our hands. So we had to ask for more soap. When they did, they also sent us a bottle of champagne as a honeymoon welcome, which we appreciate very much, but the next day after the room had been serviced, the empty bottle, bucket and used glasses were still there, right on the table. I was also very surprised to notice that they don\u00b4t have a \"used towel policy\" (bathtub means replace, hook means will use again), but they wouldn\u00b4t necessarily replace the towels we left in the bathtub either. Smaller, face towels were NEVER replaced, so after we had used the second one, no more face towels for us! One day my husband accidentally left a towel on the bed, by the time we came back, the towel had been placed extended on the bed (?), instead of being hung on a rack or replaced. Maintenance: another poor aspect. The heat was not working, and we were fortunate enough to have two not-so-cold days and nights in NY winter, but by the third day it became really cold again, so that night we could have used some decent heating. The result? I caught a pretty bad cold that night while sleeping, so when I left for the day next morning, I asked the front desk to send maintenance to my room to check on that. Maintenance never did, or if they did and couldn\u00b4t solve the issue, at least they never informed the front desk or us. So when we came back in the evening, the room was freezing (they had left the A/C crazy cold). I had to ask for extra blankets and heaters to be brought up, which they did (front desk staff was great all the time I must say). By the end of next day, after I had complained again, the heat was finally fixed. The water in the shower was cold though... guess we were not so lucky :) Last but not least: no turndown service and no trash can in the room. Just a small one in the bathroom. No minifridge either, although they are available upon request. These are the small things I was saying could be easily fixed and instantly provide a better service. But the views are great, and so is location. And the restaurant too. Next time I\u00b4ll go somewhere else, I guess.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salem, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "AggyD", "ReviewID": "UR126252264", "Content": "If you're looking for a \"destination\" hotel, you should probably look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a clean, very reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan with incredibly comfortable beds and a safe neighborhood, you simply cannot go wrong with this hotel.

This hotel has really improved since my first stay five years ago. I definitely can recommend it now and would have no hesitation about going back. Five years ago previous staff members were trying so hard to be hip they were unhelpful to the point of insolence. Things had improved by a few years ago, but now the hotel has it right.

The Roosevelt Island funiculars passing back and forth on their cables high in the air and boats going by on the East River only added to the effect. If someone wants to experience a dazzling NYC skyline at a reasonable price, a room facing south at The Bentley can not be beat. It is true that sometimes you can hear other guests - mostly in the halls where is seems some people forget to speak quietly. The walls are not that thick, however I never had a problem sleeping in any of my stays. The hotel is located near world class hospitals - both people's and animal's.

After more than a week at the Bentley Hotel I can say for sure that we will NEVER go there again, because everything is substandard. Here are our details: The location is about 15 minutes away from the next subway station. That is in fact the least handicap of this hotel! The rooms are very small and a bit shabby. The floor was dirty and was not cleaned after I asked for it. It took three days... A very small and smelly closet was hidden behind a strange door, where you could hear your neighbors as if there were in your room. The view was great, but it guess that is the only plus. The bathroom has no ventilation and turns, if you get some hot water, which is rare, into a sauna. There were not enough towels and toilet paper. Again I had to asked but did not get anything on the same day. The bar is the worst rooftop bar I have seen so far. Breakfast is expensive and not wort half of the price. At any diner around the corner you can get a better deal. Service is unfriendly and slowly. There are NO amenities! No coffee maker (just an small pricy coffee bar in the lobby with an every day very unfriendly woman), no mini-bar (just a few bottles standing together with the TV on the desk- no space), no free internet (but nevertheless extreme slowly). The elevator took ages! Worst thing was that somebody stole clothes and toys of our room and the management told us that they could not do anything because MANY people of the hotel had access to our hotel room. They could not find out what happened. For two day we had problems ending at the police and filing a report.

Approx 20 mins walk to Central park , easy to get to Bloomingdales, Macy's, 42nd street and 5th avenue . Never paid more than \u00c2\u00a310 for a taxi and even used the hotels limo service which was same price as a yellow cab . Before arriving in New York I did my own due diligence on the hotel after reading some pretty awful reviews , I emailed the hotel directly voicing my concerns on the reviews I had read. After three emails the director of rooms Brett Caspi called me personally to discuss my concerns. I was so pleased with this level of care and service that immediately all my fears were gone. I discussed with Brett that we would prefer a room on a high floor with views of the Queensborough bridge and also requested a coffee maker and a refrigerator . This was all confirmed , however upon check in things did not go quite as planned ! The guy on check in did not honour any of our requests stating that as I did not make the booking directly with the hotel and through booking.com that no special requirements could be accomodated and also the hotel was very busy ! Excuse me I made the booking in August 2011 , so you have known about it for 6 months and now your telling me your busy ! He was not the slightest bit interested that I had been speaking directly with the director of rooms prior to my arrival. I explained that I had email correspondence to back this up but as I could not show him (due to not being able to log on to my ipad) he was not interested. I asked for the director of rooms but he was not working. Also whilst checking us in he answered the telephone 4 times which I consider to be extremely rude and discourteous , no concern for the client he is dealing with . I have to say that this individual was rude, showed no concern for my requests and to be honest I doubted what our stay was going to be like if all the staff were so disinterested . Our room which I have to say was quite spacious for a twin and nicley furnished with a nice view even though it was on the 7th floor but not what I had requested , so I emailed the director of rooms my concerns and frustrations over the dreadful check in experience and requested that we meet the following day to discuss my concerns and disappointment . Within 30 mins I received a phone call from the same rude guy who checked us in , saying that Brett had picked up the email and had called in to apologise for the mis communication over the booking and as a gesture of goodwill they offered us dinner in the Resturant during our stay and a transfer to a room on the 18th floor with a coffee maker and refridgerator . We said we would move in the morning as we were a little tired. The following morning we went to reception to make arrangements to move rooms and were told the room wasn't ready ............ Erh what's going on ? It was available last night now it's not, we were then told I would be ready after 2pm and it had city view ! Mmmmmm I had requested a river view , so as you can imagine I was somewhat frustrated by now when the general manager appeared . Augustine (GM) was very apologetic and offered to move us to a suite on 18th floor at no extra cost , Brett then introduced himself and apologised for the inconvenience we had encountered. I have to say that both Brett and Augustine were both very accommodating and showed a high level of customer service unlike the guy on the font desk on check in , he could learn a lot from them both . Brett made reservations for us at The Smith which I recommend for Sunday brunch or any other day , the food and the atmosphere were fabulous and Brett even emailed the following day to check if we had enjoyed the Smith which I thought was a nice touch. Throughout our stay Brett and Augustine exceeded my expectations and made our stay at the Bentley a most pleasurable experience . The front door staff were just fabulous , so friendly and always had a big smile to greet you. I would recommend the Bentley and don't believe everything you read on here , If I had believed all the reviews I would have not stayed here, one reviewer told me to cancel and book elsewhere , I'm glad I didn't as we had a nice stay and met some great people . Whenever we ordered ice or champagne glasses in arrival back in the hotel they arrived at the room before we did !

Gorgeous view at breakfast in the morning of the 59th St bridge at sunrise. Stood there with my coffee for quite a few minutes just taking it all in before we had to go.

The bigger issue I have with this hotel, however, is they are untrustworthy with packages and don't have your back if there is an issue. I had about six packages sent to the hotel and two of them were missing. Curiously the most marketable and expensive were the ones which could not be accounted for (a Kindle Fire and Photoshop CS5 software). The custody of these packages by the Bell Hop employees was dishonest. If you have anything of value I recommend that you have all your ducks in line before picking them up as the hotel has an incompetent log-in and custody procedures. First make sure you have all your tracking numbers provided by the carrier with the specific number of boxes in each shipment and the contents of each package specified. Then OPEN THE PACKAGE IN FRONT OF THE BELL HOP and write down the contents of each package and have the employee sign the paper. With this in-person verification you have a better case to make if something is missing. My mistake was trusting that all the hotel employees would be honest but this what not the case with the Bentley. The front desk night manager took charge of my complaint and went through the motions of trying to locate the package but to no avail. (The night manager claimed he didn't recognize the name of the person who signed for a 'FedEx' delivery -- I had to point out to him the unlikelihood that a bell hop would sign for an Amazon Parcel labeled 'Amazon Fire' with his real name if he intended to steal it -- duh.) The Bentley offered no compensation. The front desk day manager claimed \"We have NEVER lost a package.\" Laughable; they lost two of mine. In contrast five days later the Gem Hotel in NYC's SoHo had all ten packages I had on hold neatly stacked and waiting in my room for me.

It's conveniently located for the subway (3 blocks from Lexington and 59th station, if you don't mind the walk, and the subway station is right next to Bloomingdales!) and we had a room with a great view of the East River and the Queensboro bridge - better than the first we were allocated which, when we opened the door, appeared to have already been occupied, with two cases in the room and other indications of someone else being in residence! Not what you want after a long flight and trip in from JFK! The room was fine, nice big bed with crisp sheets, compact bathroom adequately stocked though, as usual with most hotels, the towels could have been a bit bigger! The staff were friendly and helpful, so far, so good. Niggles about the hotel were: - our room had two windows, being on the corner; one had a good, Roman style, fabric blind while the other had two Venetian, slat, blinds. Not a problem you'd think, except that the window with the Venetian blind faced the east so as soon as the sun was up, we were woken! We were told the room had been recently renovated so why didn't someone think of putting the heavier blind on both windows? Also, in the process of renovating, the in-room fridge seemed to have been removed and not replaced and there were no tea/coffee making facilities though this might be common in all NY hotels. - the heating/cooling system was terrible! It was unseasonably warm for our visit (early November) and when we arrived the room was like a sauna, far too hot but we couldn't get the system to blow cold air. We called reception who sent up a maintenance man who 'fixed' the problem, saying it would cool down soon; it didn't! We opened windows and turned the system off. By the next day we couldn't stand it so called for help again - this time the maintenance man did solve the problem (though he had to take the front of the unit off to do it) and we were happy until a cooler day towards the end of the week. We selected heating mode on the control panel and set a temperature but only got cold air! Yet another maintenance man had to come to reset to heating. We gave up when the weather warmed up again the next day and just left the system off and opened windows to cool the room!! - on the subject of windows - we were on the 20th floor but the windows could be fully opened, just a bit alarming! - Internet access was chargeable (minimum $10 per 24 hours, cheaper if you bought more time) but I could not get my notebook to connect. A helpful call to the tech guys seemed to do the trick, but only if I took the computer outside the room, to the lift lobby to connect. It would then randomly drop the connection sometimes and stay connected for quite a while at others. The only good thing was the fact that I seemed to be able to connect for free!!! - finally, the only breakfast options were a hot and cold breakfast in the 21st floor dining room for $17.95 (plus, no doubt, tax) or the lobby coffee corner which was 'proudly brewing' Starbucks coffee and serving a few pastries, juices and sandwiches. The coffee might be Starbucks brand but certainly not as good as the stuff they serve in the branches! We had the best breakfast in the Ritz Diner, about 2 blocks west but only found it on the 2nd to last day!

That changed after my wife and I stayed at the Bentley while in NYC on business. We chose the Bentley because it was in the area of Manhattan that we wanted to stay in and the pictures on the website looked great. I will start with the positives: 1. Decent location 2. Rooms clean and modern and we had a great view of the city through large windows 3. Polite and helpful doormen That's where the good ends and the bad begins: 1. My wife and I had booked a non-smoking room with a king bed and were told when we showed up that we had to either settle for a room with a king bed on the smoking floor or a room with 2 double beds. We settled on the room with 2 double beds due to the horrendous smell on the smoking floor and ended up having to sleep in separate beds the entire trip because both of us could not fit into their tiny version of a double bed (and we are average-sized people). 2. The TV in the room did not work. We were told this was a \"building problem\" and nothing was done about it. Luckily we were in NYC so we rarely wanted to watch TV, but we couldn't even watch the news or sports scores. 3. Since it was a business trip for me, we paid upfront for 3 days of internet and the internet did not work for half that time, and we were again told that his was a \"building problem\" and nothing was done about it. 4. The iron in the room was scorched and left marks on my my dress pants. When trying to inquire with the manager about cleaning them, we were told the hotel had no in-house laundry and they tried to offer us a free breakfast in exchange from my pants being ruined. They were eventually convinced into trying to clean my pants and taking the cost of the pants of our bill if they could not be cleaned. 5. While I was at a meeting, my wife had breakfast alone at the hotel and charged it to the room. They billed us for 2 buffet breakfasts and when the error was pointed out, insisted that my wife had paid in cash for 2 people and that no refund would be offered. This was worsened by the fact that the food had been terrible. All in all, a terrible place to stay and I would advise any traveller visiting NYC to steer clear of this hotel.

The hotel itself had a fantastic view from the bar/ restaurant on the roof, looking over the Queensborough Bridge on one side. We enjoyed great cocktails there one evening. I must say a personal thank you to Helena Blat the general manager there who made our stay so special with little extra touches - some of which I did ask for in advance - but didn't expect such a high level of customer service :) The room itself was the size you would expect in NYC - we were quite pleasantly surprised as it wasn't as tiny as some reviews had led us to believe!

As for the updating of the hotel decor, \"Who Cares?\" It was clean and there were no mystery stains on linens or flooring and that's all I can ask for. I would stay at the Bentley Hotel again. On a different note, there is an amazing diner about 2 blocks away and on 60th and 1st there is a delicious Italian restaurant names Angels. (Don't quote me on the name I could be wrong.)

My sister and I spent many hours reviewing tripadvisor and other sites to pick a hotel for our 3 night stay in the city. We chose the Bentley because my sister had stayed in the hotel in the past and was pleased at that time and because they offered a smoking room. To say that we were disappointed is an understatement. The basic negatives are: 1- Run down hotel in great need of up-fitting. 2- Coffee available in the lobby at off hours but only available in the roof top restaurant in the morning. 3- Broken towel racks, shower rods in the rooms. 3- Scratched furniture. 4- Expensive taxi ride to broadway. Actually, it should have been a big clue to us that 2 taxi drivers had to 'google' the hotel to find the address! As a hotel owner myself I can say it is hard to please everyone all the time. However, you have to try. I was truely astounded by the hotels lack of effort to make us happy. The response by the manager stating we never asked for a smoking room and when offered one , chose a higher floor instead is totally false and very representative of the attitude we experienced at the time. We most certainly asked for a smoking room at reservation and were told that they could not guarantee individual requests. So...I get that. But, when we asked at check in time if they had a smoking room and were told that there was not one available for that night, but we could have one for the next two nights, we were disappointed, but understood. The next morning I called the front desk and was told very rudely that there was not a smoking room available for that night OR the next, that there was no record of that request. No apologies, no attempt to make up for their error in not putting the hold on the room for us. Nothing! I wonder if the person at the front desk just wanted to 'pass the buck' by telling us we could have one the next night. Anyway, we resigned ourselves to our room and set out enjoy the rest of our stay. We found that there was only one hand towel and no washclothes. We called the desk and were told that they would bring some to us. After an hour, we called back, asked about the towels and also asked for some ice. After another hour we called back and told them to FORGET the ice, to just bring the towels! Maybe asking for 2 different things was too much for them to handle. I understand the construction and the noise, the hotel cannot help their location and they do have to do the work required for upkeep. We do the same thing at our hotel. However, I also know that making a guest happy with their stay should be the focus of the entire staff from housekeeping through the managers. I think the snotty attitude of the front desk staff and the arrogance of the front desk manager is indicative of a persuasive negativity and no remodeling or advertising can overcome this. Until the attitude changes and the staff realizes that the patrons are the only reason they have a job there is NO reason to choose this hotel in a city that is blessed with a great many wonderful hotels. And ..Oh Yeah...the 'manger' said \" Go ahead and find another hotel if you don't like this one\" WOW! If anyone at our little hotel said this to a guest without doing everything they could to make the guest happy they would be out of a job.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, MO USA", "Title": "\u201c...not great, but fine for a short stay\u201d", "Author": "Gailmo", "ReviewID": "UR117007084", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel twice and feel it is an OK place in NYC.

If you hate overcrowded areas and prefer to stay in a more residential area off the beaten path like me, the editor of travelin-mate.com, you should take a closer look at The Bentley. The hotel is located along the Hudson at the Upper East next to Queensboro Bridge, East River Drive, and the Roosevelt Island Tram. Its interior is very modern, the rooms are clean and compared to other cities small but this is by the way the usual case in Manhattan. If you are a light sleeper you should bring earplugs, a further disadvantage of the loud metropolis, no matter which hotel you are staying in! Bellboys, receptionists, housekeeping, and the barista at the onsite coffee shop are very attentive, polite and obliging. Unfortunately, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had time to visit the top floor restaurant but the view over Roosevelt Island towards Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. To enjoy the location even more ask for a high floor room during check-in. Within walking distance you have an upscale supermarket at 1st Ave and 59th St and several restaurants along 2nd Ave. A nice recommendation is Jackson Hole Burgers @ 232 E 64th St # A if you do not want to spend a fortune traveling with family or friends. Staying in The Bentley requires some walking, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind since this is in my opinion the only way to really explore NYC. If four blocks to the subway is already too much for you take a cab. I definitely will recommend The Bentley to my readers on travelin-mate.com.

They are absolutely fantastic. Polite, friendly and could not do enough to make your stay comfortable and pleasant. They have some real gems there, and they really made my stay special. The hotel itself is pretty good for the price in NYC. The exterior looks a little tired, but stepping through the doors the interior could be a completely different hotel. Welcoming, clean and contemporary fittings are throughout the hotels. The rooms are a good size for NYC with fantastic views of the city. Wi-fi is throughout the hotel and for $10 a day you can get online, which is pretty good for a city hotel. The location isn't bad with lots of really lovely neighbourhood restaurants and shops nearby, and Bloomingdales about 10 minutes walk away, so it's ideal for shopping. The only down sides for me with this hotel was that the nearest subway is also about 10 minutes walk away. Now, I spend a lot of my time hiking and so having a wander along to the subway didn't really bother me at all, but at the end of a hard day in the city those last few blocks from the subway seemed a long way, so if you are feeling lazy jump into one of the abundant cabs. My other very minor gripe was the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom. I'm not very good in the morning until I've had my first shot of coffee so having that immediate caffine as soon as I open my eyes is considered a must for me. However, there is a very nice Starbucks just around the corner, and whilst not my first choice for coffee, it was very handy for the essential morning coffee.

The only reason why we considered staying here was because it was cheaper than all the other hotels. We booked our room through Bookit.com. We paid about $129.00 a night for a 10 day stay (awesome rate right?) When we first arrived from the airport it was located directly next to a Vet Hospital and the entrance to the FDR highway. The area looked a little sketchy at first but not horrible. There's construction work going on so there's alot of cones everywhere and signs blah blah blah. We walked up to the front desk and the employee, a hispanic fellow said hello and started to check us in. He seemed nice but not personable at all. Now maybe it's because I work in customer service, but If I'm the first person the client meets at the hotel: I'm going to make sure I have a smile and I go above and beyond for my customer. Well lets move on, people on other reviews complained about the elevators being slow. I found that they are just fine; all elevators take a while. It's no different than any other hotel elevators I've been in. Let;s talk the room. The room was a good size, especially for New York. I did think it was weird that the shower has half a glass door as a splash guard; but it seemed to work effectively. Housekeeping...GREAT! They were awesome! They did everything I requested and always left extra towels. I had one incident where my room key didn't work..front desk was nice, again no smile or a \" how are you enjoying your stay\" ehh...oh well. The hotel has a bar or restaurant on the roof top. Prices seem fair for NY and the views up there are pretty great. Finally...the neighborhood...walk up a few blocks and you are literally in the heart of everything. Right next to Central Park and shops and CHASE BANK at almost every corner. I rate this hotel a 4 but would have given them a 5 if the service from the front desk to the door people would have been nicer. This hotel has everything it takes to be a top luxury hotel, except they really need a staff that knows what the Service Industry is all about.

The reservation was booked using a third-party website for an average of $220 per night for 3 nights. Since there were three of us, I specifically asked for a king room with a rollaway. I was put on hold while the agent checked with the hotel, and the reservation for a king with a rollaway was confirmed. I received a confirmation from the hotel indicating we had a king room for 3 guests. The confirmation was from the Bentley Hotel (including a letter from Helena Blat). When we arrived, I asked to confirm that we were in a king before we went to our room. For the first time, I was told that we were in a double-room and that rollaways were not allowed in king rooms due to fire code. This would have been nice to know beforehand. How did they think 3 people were going to share a king room without a rollaway? Of course there were no king suites available, so we were stuck with the double room. The front desk attendants were less than helpful. Unfortunately, this was only the beginning of the disaster that is the Bentley Hotel. The air conditioner was not working in our room, the bathtub/shower would not drain water unless you physically held down the lever, and there were no handtowels or washclothes. The next morning when we left for the day, we asked for them to fix the air conditioning, bathtub lever and bring us sheets since the \"premium bedding\" included only a comforter, which was way too hot for a room without a working air conditioner. For some reason they could not understand our request for sheets, so we had to explain what a sheet was and why we wanted it. When we arrived back to our hotel that evening, the air conditioning and bathtub had not even been looked at. We called again and they said they would send someone up to work on it. When we got back from dinner, neither problem was fixed, but we were left with a mess of dirt and debris in the bathtub (which was very hard to wash since the drain was not working!!). At this point, my brother went down and requested a new room. The new room was smaller, but the air conditioner and shower worked. The dresser was tilted forward and the drawers would slide open, blocking the path in front of the beds. We had to use magazines to prop the dresser up so that the drawers would close. This is such a simple thing to fix so I don't understand at all why it would be this way. This time we had washclothes, but apparently in order to get washclothes you have to sacrifice your bath mat, which is absolutely necessary due to the ridiculous shower design. They should spend more money on repairs rather than trying to make the hotel look trendy. The rooftop restaurant was closed for most of our stay (what a shock!), but on the last day it had reopened and we went up for breakfast. The food was horrible and tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile. The Ritz Dinner is great for breakfast and is only 2 blocks away. We got great food there for much less than we paid for nasty food at the hotel. Never once during our entire stay did the staff at the front desk greet us when we returned to the hotel. Out of the dozen or so times we went through the front doors, only twice did a doorman opened it for us. The elevators were extremely slow. One time after waiting for over 5 minutes, an elevator came down with a worker, only for a worker to tell us no one could come on because he was going back up. If you dare stay at this hotel, I suggest getting the highest floor possible, because by the time the elevator would get to the 14th floor they were full.

At day 5 we made it up to our room on the 19th floor after a long day out in the city, only to find our keys did not work. I went back downstairs to learn that the keys must be re-coded at day 5 because there is no way to validate them for 7 days. ??? I then verified that if I had recieved a notice from the night before, or the morning of, I would have been able to visit the front desk, had my keys validated, and avoided the incovenience of what had occurred. I am still waiting for an apology for the inconvenience.... Had to call for an extra washcloth on 4 of the 7 days we were there. 3 of us were registered but only 2 washcloths were left. When I asked why only 2 were left when 3 washcloths were used, along with 3 towels, and it was obvious 3 of us were in the room, I was told that according to hotel regulations only 2 washcloths needed to be left (and 3 towels). I told the staff person that we were not about to share washcloths. I wonder if that means that if 4 of us had been in the room we would have had to repeatedly request an extra towel, as well as 2 washcloths....The bathroom was designed to have only one permanent, fixed door on the shower so the result was the floor was wet after the first person used the shower. Re-using our towels was not an option because they were needed to dry the floor after each person finished in the shower. We received a notice that the hot water was going to be turned off on one of the nights (from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning). That didn't seem too unreasonable except for the fact that there was no hot water the following morning as had been promised. Thank goodness we had showered the night before. We would have liked to have showered that morning but had to resort to washing up in extremely cold water instead. I am a runner and had to change my workout schedule and not run that morning because I would have had no warm water to shower with. We were there for St. Patrick's Day. I asked for information on the parade. I was given the correct time and location for the start but wrong information for the direction of the parade route. The parade moved uptown and I was told my the front desk staff that it went downtown.

No free wi-fi, and no fridge. Starbucks is very close (as usual = free wi-fi). I think the only reason I expected a fridge was because they do not offer ice with or without a bucket.

When selecting a hotel for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9es 29th Birthday (it was her first time in NY City), I prioritized what I thought would be important; panoramic views, location to transit, elegant accommodations, and of course a reasonable room rate were my top 4 must-have's. I read multiple review's on the Bentley Hotel, on this site and others, and booked a room for 3 nights. While reading the review's, I noticed that an attentive hotel manager was answering customer complaints and also (more often than not), thanking customers for their positive feedback. So, I decided to contact Helena Blat to ensure that our stay would be a success. Without going into the specifics of what Helena did for us (some things should remain confidential), I have to say that I was more than appreciative for what she offered. For one, her follow up with me was one of the best customer service experiences that I have experienced in the hotel industry. It's as if they trained her at the Ritz Carleton where the motto is \"ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen\". The extra touches that Helena was willing to add to our trip made our stay a classy and memorable one. The room was clean and spacious (particularly by NY standards), the view remarkable (by my standards) and the elevator was efficient. The front desk staff was professional and courteous, and the check-in/check out process was quick and simple. Even the valet staff was professional and friendly. If you are looking for one of the best value view's in NY City, look no further. As long as you are above the 15th floor and in a corner room, you will be impressed. The transit system is a bit of a walk, but not to the extent that some people have made it out to be. Even in February (it was 25 degrees and we came from Florida), it was not an unreasonable distance for us to walk. The neighborhood is upscale residential so you are able to admire the brownstone architecture and some interesting restaurants/stores on the way to the NQR train which goes downtown. Besides, after a long day of visiting the bustling neighborhoods in Manhattan, you will enjoy coming home to a relatively quiet residential area. There are literally hundreds of hotels in Manhattan to choose from and many of them are at a similar price point. So to some extent, you take a chance when selecting a room. I will say that your experience is more in your control than you think, so make an effort to research the property and communicate with the front desk/management; you might be as pleased with your experience as I was if you take my advice. One more thing, if Helena Blat ever goes to work for another hotel, I hope she communicates that to me so that I can stay wherever she is managing. Customer service in many ways is a relic of the past, Helena showed my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and I that at the Bentley hotel (under her stewardship) it is alive and well.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and upscale, but they don't pay attention to details\u201d", "Author": "jrzee", "ReviewID": "UR95746275", "Content": "The Bentley is a nicely designed hotel with very convenient highway access and a spectacular view from their hotel Diner.

We were looking forward to staying at the hotel and had positive expectations after viewing photos posted at the property's website. Our expectations were exceeded and then some! We were greeted by a very pleasant desk clerk and given our keys. I was impressed that the keys were blank suggesting anonymity if they fell into someone else's hands. We rode the elevator to the 15th floor and entered our room and were astonished at how big it was and the unique decor. The view to the west of NYC was fabulous and clearly impressive to us. On to the important amenities...the bathroom was spacious and the towels were thick, soft and thirsty. We love a shower with power and this was great. The bath had all the usual lotions and soaps. The body wash was a nice unexpected touch. I like coffee first thing in the morning and I missed a coffee maker in the room. This proved not t be a problem as I am generally awake and about long before my wife. I knew that coffee was available on the 21st floor at the rooftop restaurant. Even if you don't drink coffee or plan on eating somewhere else, the elevator ride up is worth it. What a view! It really was breathtaking. We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet one morning. It was luxurious to spend a leisurely time eating and scanning the skyline. What really is most important in a hotel room is how well one rests. My wife and I had some of the best night's sleep in a while. the bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows generous and so soft. We did linger in bed longer than we anticipated.

I would have normally booked a four star but took a chance on a three star rating as I was traveling by myself and figured I could weather a less than stellar stay as I was only here for one day and two nights. All in all I thought the property was okay when I first checked in but then the wheels fell off. Here are the items that I endured... Check-in: I booked through Hotwire but when I checked my bank account I saw that my credit card was charged for the room. When I asked the front desk they told me that when I gave my card the person checking me in made a mistake and charged my card for the full stay and didn't notice the Hotwire precharge. I asked for them to remove the authorization and they told me to trust them that it wouldn't be billed - not very convincing. I guess we will see if I get billed twice and what happens to the traveler on a budget who gets an extra $400 authorization - they didn't pay attention to detail obviously. Guest Room: The room was clean from what I could tell, however there were several items that I found completely unacceptable. First the front door bolt lock didn't work - I tried pulling and and tugging to get it to bolt with no luck. Second was the television - they have older 32\" LCD televisions but the remote battery was obviously weak as I struggled throughout my stay with changing the channel effectively, volume control and on/off. The television picture was horrible - no HD and most of the analog channels were mislabeled and very fuzzy - not good. I then took a look in the mini-bar and although it had power it was warm - the drinks were not even a bit chilled - the mini-bar was effectively not cooling at all. I then thought about trying one of the snicker bars but when I opened the package and took my first bite I about choked as the snicker bar was so old that it was that awful stale taste - can't imagine if they date inventory at all or even check the mini-bar at all? Internet Access: One of my biggest pet peaves is a hotel that charges for High Speed and then gives you awful internet speeds. I did some speed checks throughout the stay and the best speed I received was 168kbps - this is 1/100th of the speed I get at home. I couldn't even download a large powerpoint. Can't believe I get charged $10 a day for Internet that averaged a 2x speed of normal dialup at 56.6kbps. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE - I would have been upset if it was complimentary!!! Also, I couldn't bill to the room and had to bill my credit card separately and they must have some guy and a truck providing service because I got a personal e-mail from some guy named Lee Matthew at Lee@Cronow.com! I really don't trust having to give my credit card to an unknown entity that is obviously a garage based operation. Roof top restaurant: I went to get a drink and an appetizer. The bar has a nice view of the bridge but the atmosphere in the bar/restaurant was pretty weak. There was a television hanging at an angle and appeared to be close to falling off the wall. They had a lot of staff but it was obvious that they hadn't been trained well. When I received my food they didn't even offer me condiments or napkin and silverware. I shouldn't have to ask for thisand chose the NY Steak sandwich - which was okay. Attention to detail is key and this property could do so much better. Little things like quality internet service, television service and amenities, competant check-in and dining experience - if I would of had one of these items I might not have written this review. A comfortable bed and hot shower are not the only things I look for when choosing a hotel!

I didn't arrive until after 11pm and luckily I took a taxi because if I were driving, I definitely wouldn't have found it. I noticed that the manager responds to the majority of the posts (which I was thrilled to see) so I am hoping she sees this and suggests to maintenance that they luminate the outside sign. I can see how people would go right by it and not even see it. The lobby is really well decorated and made me anxious to explore the rest of the hotel. I had to print out some items for the walk the next day so I used the business center on the 2nd floor. It is really large. When I asked about the location at the front desk, the agent told me he wasn't sure if it was open. I didn't need a key or anything to access it so I would just confirm the hours if you absolutely HAVE to get something done while you are there just to be on the safe side. The rooms are nice but there was a slight odor to our room (703) as soon as you walk in. It wasn't overpowering and you really didn't notice while in the room. The beds were comfortable but there was no sheet on my bed, just the comforter and the fitted sheet. I thought that was a little odd. The AC is a bit out dated and a little loud but nothing to keep you from sleeping. It was, however, not very cold. I tolerated it the first night because I was so tired after a long day but the next day it really was too hot in there. I called the front desk, they sent maintenance up right away and he changed the filter. After that I had no problems. The bathroom is really nice. There is a glass partition that only covers half of the shower. Although aesthetically it's gorgeous, it is not very functional. You can't move it so you can only hope that the person before you did not leave the shower part engaged because if so, your hair will get drenched once you turn the water on. While in the shower, the water gets on the floor because again, there is only the half partition. Some colleagues told me that the rooftop restaurant had great food but it was closed when I arrived on Friday and closed unexpectantly on Saturday. We did go up anyway so we could have a few drinks. It is beautiful. It reminded me of a really swanky NY club/lounge. The view was gorgeous and even better at night. I would highly recommend going up there at least once. The location was fine for me during that visit. There is gas station next door and a pizza place on 64th (I wasn't impressed AT ALL), but other than that, not much in the immediate vicinity as others have already stated. If I was trying to sightsee NY, I would stay closer to the city/action. Although there is a garage the hotel uses for parking, it is on the street behind the hotel. No one told us we had to pay at the hotel, therefore we ended up paying more to the garage attendant. I would give PLENTY of notice when you are ready for your car because they took quite a while. I think the hotel should offer valet parking that way the guests wouldn't have to worry about the parking headaches. The elevators were quite annoying because they were EXTREMELY slow.

Very reasonable prices considering NYC standard. ($179/night). An extra feature: great pasta in the rooftop restaurant with the breathtaking view of the Queensboro bridge. Also, free coffee in the lobby. Staff was very friendly. Cons? A little noisy AC, no usable fridge (other than the small one stuffed with very expensive stuff), no free wi-fi and no coffee maker.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wadsworth, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cIt was a pleasure\u201d", "Author": "steve_harp", "ReviewID": "UR77857252", "Content": "This was our family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trip to New York and we were very apprehensive about picking a hotel.

Hotel should make walls thicker in standard rooms with more soundproofing materials. (and block off the fake door). Maybe its just a few that was like this ? I would not stay again if in a standard room but would in a corner room if price was lower. Anyway, they were very understanding and put us into a corner room which was soooooooo much better. The location is very good imo, its less busy on the roads outside (but still a little manic) , it is only a 20 min walk away from central park and about 20 mins to the larger shops starting with Bloomingdales. Times square is about 40 mins stroll and Ground zero is about 4 hrs stroll away which includes many many coffee and cake stops. We came across many places such as Grand Central, Tiffanys, times square, Macys, Empire state bulding, Flatiron building, Rockerfella centre , Ground Zero which had a very large discount store across the road and many other sites as well. We caught a yellow cab back to the Bentley and surprised at the cheap cost of 16.50 dollars. The room was very modern and clean but the showers need redesigning , too much water on floor and shower head not that good. The lobby was very smart and so was the restaurant on 21. There is a wine bar being currently constructed by the patio area outside the hotel lobby. Smoking was not a problem as you can use the patio area. Majority of staff were very helpful, especially Danny. He was a world of knowledge on Manhattan. Other doormen/porters were good too but the reception staff were ok but not on the same wavelength as the porter/doormen etc. The 2 ladies staff in the restaurant were very polite and helpful.

Complimentary coffee and tea are served in the lobby from 11am to 11pm.

I found myself in the restaurant where lots of people where enjoying their breakfast, only to be interupted by me, on the scrounge for a couple of cups of filter and then being humililated by the waitress who said that from now on it was 3 dollars a cup and no I could'nt have any unless I gave my room number! They need a kettle and some cups in the rooms just like a HOTEL. Anyway after 7 nights there I would say we have a pretty good idea about the Bentley, take comfortable, used, walking shoes as it's a good 15 minutes to the nearest subway, 30mins to times square (walking) rooms are small unless single traveller, mini bar is outrageously expensive, $28 for a small bottle of wine, $6 for a $1 pack of pringles, any problems with the t.v, safe box, lack of toilet roll, clothes hangers,(draw your own conclusions) where promptly dealt with. Rooms where clean ,bathroom was very good, plenty of towels etc and staff where always polite and proffesional.

I will try to atach photos. At check in the receptionist had told me that she 'could not change the room as I was part of a group' Clearly this was nonsense and the hotel was clearly far from full. I don't know why some, thankfully few, people in one's travels are so nasty. Probably she is unhappy, unless I was meant to slip her a few dollars for such a request, in which case I may be just naive. I have traveled all over the world, and I was sorry to disappoint my wife who seldom accompanies me. I would have complained to the hotel but I can't seem to find a site one can contact.

It was really spacious and elegant. I could not believe that this was the hotel I booked since my rate was really not that high for New York and I had stayed in a hotel which was rated as luxury hotel in the past few days and that was not nearly as luxurious as the Bentley Hotel. The next surprise came when I checked in and I was notified that I got a complimentary upgrade to a suite. I was quite exited and happy since the past fews were quite exhausting and I was really looking forward to relax a bit. The suite was beautifully decorated with a great and comfortable bed, two flat screen TVs and a nice view (the panorama windows where so beautiful!). In the evening I decided to treat myself to a nice dinner at the hotel restaurant at the rooftop. I really enjoyed my dinner, the great view and, by the way, had the best ros\u00c3\u00a9 wine in my life!

Do not use Super Shuttle! It is more expensive than taking a cab and the time lost because you have to drop off other passengers is ridiculous. I paid $32 dollars through Expedia and found out it was only $28.50 at the Super Shuttle counter (already $3.50 in the hole). We waited for 15 minutes for the shuttle to arrive to take us to our hotel. There was a couple already inside the van. They said they were in the van for 30 minutes already. We circled the airport and went back to their original pick up to get 2 more people. That's 15 minutes for us in the van, still at the airport. We picked up 2 more riders. Now we have spent 25 minutes in the van, still at the airport. So with the van full with 6 passengers and 1 driver you would assume we would be on our way, but no. We drive to another pick up and get 2 more riders. So now the van is uncomfortably full and we have spent 45 minutes driving around the airport picking up passengers. Not that big of a deal, because we should be the first group to get dropped off. We landed at LaGuardia and our hotel is in the Upper East Side, no brainer! Not the case. The first drop off was in the financial district. Too make a long miserable story a little bit shorter, we spent 2 hours 15 minutes in that van to finally get to our hotel. Which is a 20-25 minute taxi ride. I had already purchased a return ride from our hotel back to the airport. They quoted a 8:30 AM pick up with arrival at 10:30 AM at the airport. Our flight left at 12:59 PM. I ate the $32 dollars and we took a taxi for $23.50. Don't waste your time on Super Shuttle. Take a taxi or a private town car for $36. Okay we finally arrive at the Bentley, hooray! Bellman opens the door and greets us. He grabs our bags and we proceed to check in. I had requested a room on their top floor with the disclosure that it was our 1st wedding anniversary. I let the lady checking us in know about our awful experience getting to the hotel just in case I was being a little crabby. Check in was quick and friendly. We were given our keys to a room on the 6th floor, bummer! Definitely felt let down by the hotel. We go up to the room and open the door to find 2 double beds. 2 seconds later we are back down in the lobby and I talk to an extremely helpful gentleman and inform him of the situation. It's our 1st wedding anniversary, not our 50th! Viola! We get a room on the 11th floor with a view of the river and Queensboro bridge! Plus a king size bed. Room was nice, view was great. Only complaint was the AC. The unit is really old and it doesn't cool down the room very well. You must go up to the restaurant for a drink at night and enjoy the spectactular views! Central Park is 7 blocks east of the hotel. It takes 25-30 minutes to walk there. The closest subway is approximately 15 minutes away. It is a $15 taxi ride to Times Square.

Finally I asked her to close the doors gently as I was jetlagged - was up all night and was trying to sleep. She was rude and said - well, I am checking the rooms. I said yes, but the doors don't need to be slammed over and over while you are doing it! She slammed a few more doors and I called the front desk to complain.

Positives: - Clean, comfortable and nicely furnished hotel room. - Bathrooms were decently sized for NYC bathroom. - Nice bath amenities. - Staff were all very pleasant and friendly, really great. - Smaller hotel with boutique-like feeling. - Very reasonably priced hotel. Negatives: - Location is very far east so if you're in NYC to sightsee and you don't need to be on the upper east side, then do not stay here. You have to take a taxi to get anywhere (yes, there is a bus across there street but the buses in NYC are extremely slow due to traffic) and the subway stop is too far to comfortably walk to/from. I would advise staying midtown or more central area near subway. Also, the restaurants near the hotel are mediocre at best. There just isn't much to do around here. - Noisy windows. I've stayed at a number of NYC hotels over the years and most hotels are pretty quiet considering you're in NYC. For some reason, both hotel rooms here were very noicsy. I could hear the noise of cars traveling on the 59th st. bridge and the honking from the cars on the street below. Much much too noisy I thought. - NYC was experiencing some very mild weather for November and it was sunny and gorgeous. Unfortunately, the heat was on in the hotel and it was stifling and completely uncomfortable. They gave me a fan but that just blew around the hot air so it was not a relief at all. And I'm the type of person that prefers hot weather. So, if that happens, ask for a north facing room (so the sun doesn't beat down on the windows). We switched rooms and it helped. This is probably an occasional problem but when it does happen, it is pretty annoying. - No ice bucket or ice on the floors (although you could call and ask for ice and they will send it to you). No coffee maker, etc. - Mini bar in room is not cold so even if you want to spend $5 on a coke, if you open the door, nothing in there is cold! That was kinda annoying when you're thirsty and need something to drink. There is a gas station right next to the hotel where we picked up some cold drinks the next night.

The lobby, our room and bathroom were all very modern and clean. The room had a flat screen tv and had a view of the East River & Queensboro bridge, which was quite nice. It was a much nicer view than I've had right in midtown in pretty nice hotels. The bathroom was average size for NYC (small), but modern and still had plenty of room. It had glass enclosed shower, which I prefer over bath/tub combo with shower curtain anyway. Bed was very comfortable with nice sheets & down or down alternative pillows. The only downside to this hotel is the location. It's in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood, but as a tourist I like being in the middle of everything and you're not really near anything. The closest subway was a good 5-6 block hike, with only one or two lines going up that way. We just took cabs instead to avoid the hastle.

Others have mentioned about the shower having an unmovable glass door that only extends half way and this is a problem as the floor does get wet. That evening we went upstairs to the restaurant on the top floor and had a delicious snack with nice views. As we didn't expect to stay in the hotel for 2 nights,we checked out in the morning. Later in the day, I learned that we would need to stay in NYC another night and I called the hotel to see if they could acccommodate us for another night. They connected me to a \"reservation line\" and I was informed that the price of the room was substantially higher. I explained that I was there due to a family member being in Hospital for Special Surgery and they then offered a 10% discount. It was still substantially higher than the right before,but when we returned to check in again, we were Upgraded to a \"Deluxe Suite\" with 2 rooms which was very nice.

The glass covering only covers half the shower so water splattered everywhere.

They asked us whether we recognized 2 amounts charged to the card the previous day: $US 753.26 and $US 762.22. We told them no, and they said they would cancel the card immediately, issue new ones, and investigate what we thought were fraudulent transactions. Only when we told the front desk about the situation on the morning of our departure did it become clear that it was the hotel that had charged these two amounts to our card without any prior reference to us. We then agreed that what we actually owed the hotel for our stay was $US 612.22. The manager we spoke to said he would deduct $US 30 from that total because of the cost of our phone calls to the card services center in the UK. We explained that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contact card services again until Monday, because it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staffed over the weekend. He asked us to phone them on Monday and e-mail him the details. We phoned them on that Monday, and discovered that the charges currently appearing as pending were $US 762.22, $US 612.22, $US 612, 22 (again!) and $US 582!! We were also told that as those charges were still pending, they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us who had placed them until the money had been taken! It left us with only $US 182.13 in that account, with our cards canceled, and we had to begin traveling again 35 minutes after placing that phone call! The hotel had by now levied a staggering $US 2,568.66 against our account for a bill that should only have become payable at checkout, and should only have amounted to that final $US 582. We e-mailed these details to the manager, and said that we thought we were entitled to some compensation for the considerable inconvenience and anxiety caused, and that we would give him until the end of the week to respond to that suggestion before posting the story on the web. It is now the end of the week, and we have received no reply from the hotel. Our latest bank statement shows that the amount of money which has been taken is now correct, and the funds that were locked in PENDING have been returned to our account. However, until we receive new cards posted to our address in Belize, the only way we can access the money is to transfer it to a different account (which we happen to have \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not everybody would) which still has a functioning card attached to it.

This seemed a bit of an overreaction to me. This hotel has been renovated recently so TA readers should understand that many of the older reviews may pertain to the hotel pre-reno and pre-rebranding. It now has a very mod boutique look and bright white sheets which gave us the feeling that it was clean and comfortable, and it was. Reviewers who complain about location and noise obviously never lived in a city - subway, shopping, food and sights are within a 4 block walk (small blocks). Noise - well, I think you'd have trouble finding anything quiet in NYC! We feared noise from the FDR expressway next door, but the noise was actually from the cabs at the intersection instead. My friend used earplugs to sleep, I didn't, and both of us were comfortable.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cScoring \"B-\" for Bentley\u201d", "Author": "jcindc", "ReviewID": "UR31206827", "Content": "Needed upper east side location close to Hunter College for a graduation....also had rendezvousing out-of-towners wandering in from Brooklyn so the Bentley got the nod over the Fitzpatrick, Lombardy, Kimberly, or Affinia. We were told the property is actually a converted office tower but with WORLD-HOTELS branding and a sweet spot view of the East River and Roosevelt Island at about $200 per nite. Most of the TA comments and the #165 ranking are spot-on.....you can do somewhat better in room sizes, subway access, and overall refinements, but you will likely have trade-offs in the choices. For example, we drove up with our car so off-street parking at less than a small ransome was a priority......$20 per nite was the tarriff, and albeit there is no valet and the garage is actually a private operation at the opposite end of the block, you will do no better anywhere in NYC. The rooftop bar-restaurant was more bohemian than minimalist, and lacking in the usual trendy accoutrements....but six cocktails and two beers were only $58, again a more than reasonable tarriff for the take. Our northeast corner room had great floor-to-ceiling windows but irregular soffets and wall offsets are prevalent and narrow the walking space to somba-swivel clearances around the furniture and bed. Check-in was uneventful and quick enough, but we arrived relatively late on a Wednesday nite and through the two day stay, there appeared to be no shortage of lines and problems at the desk. NOTE to Management: one clerk for 197 rooms is obviously NOT a best practice. We score the \"B-\" for Bentley primarily based on the above tainted by a substandard bathroom and notable annoyances. The 35 square foot bathroom is a disaster on every front: there is no ventilation whatsoever to the point that the wooden door has swelled and can't be closed.....and even with it open the room mists up like a sauna; the pedestal sink is so tiny the small soap dish constantly falls in the basin; the half-curtain glass in the shower does indeed keep HALF the water IN, and HALF the water OUT on the floor; and the toilet bowl protrudes in front of the doorway, which is always a pleasant site entering the room. NOTE to Management: install an exhast fan in the shower before the drywall ceiling comes down; change the swing on the bathroom door so you can hide the view; and buy a shower curtain. The rest of the annoyances are correctible but include: horrible tv reception; ridiculously slow elevators; problematic room keycards-- the sole maintenance guy was running all over the hotel letting people in their rooms which left us waiting forever to get in ours; and last but not least, noisey and unrefined guests yelling in the hallways and making prank calls. Yes this is NYC and folks tend let it all hang out here, but we expected better manners after midnite on a Thursday for upper east side visitors. Bottom-line: if you don't have to park a car and are not targeting a specific spot on the upper east side, there are better choices for comparable dollars, especially if you are coming in with luggage-- the Lexington Ave subway is a 6 block walk....TIP: use 61st St as there are some really cool household furnishings stores. Otherwise for more than a couple nights consider the Affina or Kimberly.....or for extended stays, there are many vacation rental properties in the area that are a better value.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, QC", "Title": "\u201ca mixed experience\u201d", "Author": "ferdtelvin", "ReviewID": "UR30145796", "Content": "Contrary to previous reviews, the staff was very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is about five blocks from the closest subway (59th and Lexington) so a bit of a walk but that is what you do in NYC!. We walked to Rockerfeller Center and it took less than 30 minutes. One restaurant that we HAVE to mention is Espresso's Caffe at 1135 1st Avenue www.expressoscaffe.com. You MUST go there. It is only one block from the hotel and Francesca and her staff will serve you the most amazing pasta and bread. The prices are so amazing and portion sizes are overwhelming.

At one point I got on the elevator in the lobby and there was a yellow cone in front of the elevator door that said \"wet floor.\" I got on and pushed the button for my floor and waited and stood and waited and nothing happened. After awhile I gave up and stepped back out in the lobby and the terrifically professional clerks behind the front desk were laughing and one of them called out to us that we were on the service elevator. Ha, ha, laugh it up Chuckles. Could have told me, no? Oh that would have required a hint of customer service. To top it off I got a notification this morning that my credit card - the one I used at the hotel (which was the only time I used it in NY) was being cancelled and replaced because it had been \"compromised\" by \"fraudulent activity.\" Gee, I wonder how that happened?

First, although we'd booked three weeks in advance and asked for a room on the upper floors with a view, we were put in a room on the second floor with a view on the 'charming' building across the street. The staff mumbled something about 'damage done to a number rooms' as an excuse for it.

Well, when we came back the next evening, we discovered that we were in an identical room on the 6th floor. No upgrade whatsoever, but the room had some problems with its heaters. It wasn't a big deal, but somewhat annoying. I guess you can expect only so much for a hundred bucks... On the positive side: the rooms were spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom clean and large enough, with a great, hot shower. Also, we had a glass of wine at the bar on the 21st floor in the evening (great view) for $7.50, not bad at all for NYC. Some people complained about the location and that it was too far out (from what?). Well, I guess that depends on what you call far and what your preferred mode of transportation is.

I had read some bad reviews so I was prepared for anything. LIKED: - It was close to La Guardia airport, taxi to the hotel cost ($22USD) - a great alternative to flying into JFK airport which I think I read somewhere which would have cost $45USD by taxi. - Close to where New Yorkers lived, the location was surrounded by residential buildings so you don't feel like living in a tourist zone - Modern furnishing, clean bedsheets, clean bathroom - Great solid and comfy queen sized bed - Large windows (though curtains need to come down at night otherwise people living in the opposite facing apartment can see you but it is a fair distant apart) there were views of the bridge in the far left window from my level - think it was the 6th floor but nothing really to rave about DISLIKE: - No luggage assistant when I arrived, had to manage with heavy backpack and maneuvering through the door myself - Staff appeared more alive with other front desk staff than me checking in - The heater did not work well to heat up the room and there wasn't additional blankets to use so you do wake up in the night feeling a bit cold - The ipod dock did not work - The bathroom set up appeared to resemble a disabled person bathroom - the toilet had a very high seat and no lid, there was a chair in the shower, the basin had large handles to turn tap on and off, there was no where to put your tooth brush or toiletry bag or hang up clothes while you shower (remember no toilet seat) - there was a towel rack but water from the shower head could reach the rack, the shower curtain hooks also kept falling off when you move it to get in and out of the shower - Water from the tap was either super hot or cold, there was not way to adjust it to \"warm\" which reduced my shower time - You must pay for the internet, pay tv channels and snacks even if you move them from the box - apparently they have some sensor system that if you move an item for more than 30 seconds it gets charged to your room - I didn't test it out fearing I would be charged - No space in the mini bar for personal snacks it also had some special sensor system if items were removed - No kettle for making tea or cups to do so - Great sleep but woken up at 6am by the sound of police whistles directing morning traffic and attempted to get back to sleep but noise continues until 10am - Noisy / loud talking guest next door but this is obviously case by case MOST UNHAPPY ABOUT: Arriving back after a long day to find that the cleaner had not closed my door properly after cleaning / or room had been broken into (not sure really) since I don't trust anyone and lock up all my personal belongings when I go out to minimize my chance of having anything stolen. I did complain to the front desk but their response was to acknowledge the call and a small apology. SUMMARY: I stayed for 4 nights, walking to get to the main avenues was okay since I was a tourist but would probably recommend to first time tourist to stay somewhere closer to the action if they don't enjoy walking. Overall it is very neat, clean and modern place to stay but I am not sure whether that is enough to compensate for having simple luxuries such as having a heated room, warm shower temperature, being able to sleep in, competent cleaning staff, room in the fridge to store personal snacks, a kettle to make some tea.

Already at check-in we felt very welcome by both the doorman and the front desk. They followed us to a great room with a fantastic view as promised. The room was more then big enough for us, the bed was okey and a plus for the flat-screen. The only drawback was the bathroom, with a toilet who didnt flush all the time (and refilled water) and a problem with the hot water in the shower, but you sort it out by just letting it stay on for a while.

We didnt discover before after a couple of days that the previous guest had actually eaten up the whole pringles without removing it! Smart guy! But we didnt have to pay for it thanks to the kind front desk girl . The corridors is a bit dark but thats really not a problem. A small drewback was also that the tv could offer any pay-tv sports channel for watching NFL or NHL. Yes, the hotel is a bit \"far away\" if you could say that about new york, but its only a 10dollar candrive from empire state and the area felt really safe. We walked everyday to to around Time square and started our day from there. Its a nice 20min walk. Nearby you also got a some avenues with great shopping.

You also find a small and expensive internet cafe on 3rd ave. But MOST important, on 1th ave youll find RITZ, prob the best diner on manhatten! Its a classic american diner, open 24hours, serving gigantic portions of food! The service is above everything, the food is lovely and its so cheap! 20 dollars for 2 persons. Talking about food, if your in CHINATOWN, find Big Wong. It prob got the best soup in the world, but watch out, this place gets really crowdy! Forget it in the weekends. If you want cheap hockey tickets, go to the official page for the club and buy them on \"ticket exchange\", but if your going to an islandrs match, be prepared for a long and expensive journey. The train from Pen station takes 1 hour till your stop and from there its an 10min taxitrip. (get a real taxi, not one of the pirates outside the train station, we paid 20dollars! and remember if you buy return for the train, get to the right station, we took another taxi to the wrong station because he said it was the right one). When your leaving the match its impossible to find a taxi, walk to the hotel nearby, they will get you a taxi! But, I really recommend Bentley, we will come back in the summer!

My family consists of a 58 year old Computer Consultant, my wife, a 51 year old School Teacher, my daughter, a 22 Year Old Sabbatical University President, and my son, a 13 year old schoolchild. We had flown from our home in the United Kingdom for a short break in New York. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the first time that we have been in New York, nor the first time that we have been in the United States, in fact we have travelled extensively for both business and pleasure to the United Sates and many other locations around the World. It was a memorable stay for many good and one really bad reason. The really bad reason was because we chose, yes chose, to stay at the Bentley. When we checked in we were given two rooms, one which was suitable for my wife and me and one which was not suitable for my son and daughter, because it only contained one bed. Reception advised us that we could convert the sofa in our room to a bed and that they would move my children the very next morning. Reception were as good as their word, the next morning they moved my children to a twin bedded room. Unfortunately it smelt of tobacco smoke. I went down to reception and advised them of the smell because I did not want to be charged the advertised penalty of $250 for having the room cleaned following our departure. Although the room smelt, I told them that it was not a major issue and there was no need to move again for which the Receptionist thanked me for my understanding. We had a wonderful time in New York , we engaged in some sightseeing, some retail therapy and ate and drank well, we even Ice Skated in central park, which was truly magical. As usual the people were warm, friendly and very helpful, in fact everything that we have come to expect and have experienced on all of our other trips to the United States. We returned to the United Kingdom on 30th December after having settled our hotel bill. On the 13th January I received my December Mastercard statement which contained a charge from the Bentley Hotel for $250. Once my wife had scraped me down from the ceiling, me having assumed that the charge was for cleaning the room that my children had occupied and that somehow Reception had forgotten the discussion that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had with regarding the smell of tobacco smoke, I decided to pursue the matter. Incidentally, at this stage I should point out that neither my wife, nor my daughter nor my son have ever smoked, and whilst I was once a social leper I renounced tobacco some 15 years ago and have not smoked since. I immediately phoned my credit card issuer and after a discussion initiated a dispute procedure that is being pursued up by their Fraud Department as the transaction was conducted without either my, approval, knowledge or presence. I then phoned the Bentley, at premium day time international rates and attempted to have a conversation regarding the charge. First I spoke to the receptionist who put me on hold for 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 minutes whilst she attempted to get hold of the Front Desk Manager. Eventually she took my number and promised that she would get the Front Desk Manager to call me. No one called, so I sent a detailed e-mail, however, just like the call, no one replied to my e-mail. So the following morning I sent a detailed fax incorporating the content of the previous days e-mail. After many hours, the Font Desk Manager eventually phoned, unfortunately I was out at the time so my wife took the call. Apparently, the charge had nothing to do with room cleaning, it was for the disappearance of a Radio Alarm Clock complete with iDOCK from the room that my children had occupied. The fact that the item was missing had been reported by Hotel Housekeeping, incidentally the same Hotel Housekeeping that had allowed a room that smelled strongly of tobacco smoke to be occupied by non-smoking guests. A first discussion with the Front Desk Manager and a subsequent conversation with the Hotel Manager revealed an implicit accusation of theft of the Radio Alarm by me or one of my party. In fact the Hotel Manager vigorously defended her action in charging my card because I had supposedly signed a waiver that allowed her to charge me should anything be found to be missing from the rooms occupied by my party. So by default we were guilty of theft. When I pointed out to her that it was highly unlikely that I or, any member of my party would have stolen a $50 piece of tat that was unlikely to function in the UK because of different power supply and plug standards, or run the risk of arrest at the airport, she said that the matter had been resolved as they had refunded the $250 dollars. I made it quite clear that whilst they may have made a refund the unfounded accusations of theft were very far from resolved. In the same conversation there was no contrition, nor any mention of any recompense, for the wrongful accusation, the trouble, the trauma, the cost of international call and fax, all that I received form the Hotel Manager by way of apology or recompense was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry that you are so bitter about this incident, but we have refunded the charge. Have a nice day!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come as a surprise to most sane people, but here in the UK people are assumed to be innocent until proven to be guilty. If I was guilty as charged then the Hotel probably did have the right to charge my card. However, as there is no guilt on my part or my family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s they acted unlawfully in charging my card without any authority whatsoever. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have the decency to try and contact me before they took my money. Am I mad? You bet I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m mad. Am I going to try and do something about it? You bet I am. Firstly, I tried to have an e-mail dialogue with the Managing Director of the Amsterdam Hospitality Chain, one Nejib Ayed, but although he has opened / read my e-mails he has not afforded me the courtesy of a reply. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also discussing the matter with my legal advisor as we speak, so depending on when you read this things may have moved on. Now what advice would I give anyone who is contemplating staying in the Bentley? At least ensure that you make a detailed inventory of the room contents before you sign anything and get Housekeeping Services and Reception to countersign it. Scrutinise the detail of anything that you do sign before you sign it just in case you unwittingly give licence to the Hotel make charges against your credit card. And bye the bye the walls are paper thin, so you hear everything from neighbouring rooms and, eat out because the food in the restaurant is not good value when contrasted with the quality and value for money offered in all manner of local restaurants.. Based on my experience of the Bentley, how likely do you think I would stay in or recommend one of the Amsterdam Hospitality Group Hotels? Will we travel in the United States again? Of course we will because excluding the above episode time spent in the US is full of really great family memories . PS Although I was promised a full refund, their repayment has left me even further out of pocket which I will add to the bill for compensation for the false accusation, the hurt, the cost of calls and faxes and the inconvenience.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cThe Bentley is good - with few improvements needed\u201d", "Author": "itamarboston", "ReviewID": "UR23078258", "Content": "The Bentley's location on York ave. is more convenient than I had thought - 10 minute walk from Lex/59 subway station.

Our plans changed and we tried to book an addtional night. This involved waiting for over 16 minutes to speak to a human being but we were offered a king size room for the third night at the same rate. On arrival at about 5 pm on a weekday, the desk staff were cool to say the least but we were shown up to a room on the 10th floor. The room was a good size and overlooked the 59th Street bridge and the cable car to the island. It had a nice sitting area. However as soon as we began to unpack the noise from the air conditioning unit which was a basic box was so loud that we could not converse with each other. I went into the bathroom and was not able to obtain hot water from either the basin or the bath. I called reception and the tired way that I was dealt with indicated that this was not the first time room 1001 had had these problems. I was promised a maintenance visit which was a long time in coming. By the time the man arrived we were all unpacked and wanting to go out. The maintenance man arrived and said that the only way to avoid the noise from the unit was to switch it off. As the windows did not open this was not an option, After about half an hour of work in the bathroom he obtained hot water. We were very hot and sweaty. WE had to switch the unit on again. However the noise from the ac unit was intolerable and I went down to the reception desk to suggest that it was either a room change or we would have to move hotels. A room change was offered to 1511 but absolutely no help in packing up or moving so another hour of our visit was spent repacking two large suitcases and moving them to a room the other side of the hotel wiht a very partial view of the river. This was much quieter but also much smaller so I suggested to the desk that this was a lower grade of room as it was so much smaller and perhaps the room rate should be adjusted. I based this on the hotel web site which was very specific about room sizes and room rates. The desk clerk was absolutely adamant that the room was the same size and refused a reduction. At about 7 pm hot and quite tired from the room moving; I, a woman aged 58 and smartly dressed went to the roof top bar to have a drink. There were two bar staff behind the bar talking to a couple of customers. I took a table by the window. Two other tabels were occupied by groups of business men, five on one side and four on the other. I sat and waited for the waiter to finish his conversation at the bar. After about ten minutes he approached my end of the room, to take my order I thought. Not so lucky, he offered refills to one party, went off and got them, then walked smartly past me to the otehr group and did the same for them. As I am far too large to be invisible, I then walked to the bar and odered a vodka collins, the other barman made it using his hand to transfer ice to the glass and continuing his conversation with the couple. I paid him and took my glass back to my table. I finished my drink but neither member of staff approached to offer me a refill which I had to fetch from the bar.

The rooftop bar free-hand pours stiffies. The view is awesome from the outdoor lanai in all directions (360 degrees). The area is totally safe at all hours. No, it's not a five star hotel. But come on, if you want that you are going to PAY! And why? This place will suit you just fine. My wife and I are upper-class people and I'm telling you this place is a good deal. The staff were all super nice and helpful. The hotel contracts with a company that provides a black Lincoln town car limo which took us back to JFK for a flat rate of $50. You can't beat that with a big stick! Next time, I will try to arrange for them to pick us up when we arrive. And yes, I will be looking to the Bentley for my accomodations. We went to Carnegie deli (split a sandwich!), Central Park (took a nice nap with my wife on the grass), to the Top of the Rock (do this!), Rockefeller plaza, St. Patrick's cathedral and then the Comic Strip Comedy Club (which truly had me in stiches but the drinks and food are extremely overpriced -- $10 Corona's, $15 Crown, $13 Nachos!). The next day we went to the SouthStreet Seaport to the TKTS booth. The line was somewhat long, but it goes pretty fast. Had lunch at J.P. Mustards which was good. Walked to Wall Street/NY Stock Exchange, Trinity Episcopal Church, WTC ground zero (very moving) and almost got into a fight with some piece of [--] selling blown-up newspaper articles espousing that our own government blew up the world trade center buildings.

They were good at getting us to the show on time (Prime Rib was already cooked, so no waiting:). Then on to Time Square which was PACKED! It was totally cool. Get this through your head: Nothing is cheap in NYC. We did find, however, that most meals can be split (my $43 prime rib was so big neither of us could finish our HALF).

The room was on the 8th floor and was not too noisy and the view was a typical NY view of tower blocks which is what you expect in NY and besides who wants to sit in their hotel room all day and night in the city that never sleeps!

Another plus for this hotel is the helpfullness of the staff, they are all very helpful, polite and friendly. Ask the concierge for assistance and he will be more than happy to help you with any questions you may have including theatre tickets, directions, checking in for on-line for flights and many other things. All in all this hotel is a very good hotel. I guess the only slight critisism I could say was that it is quite far from the centre but that wouldn't stop me from staying here again as there are plenty of cabs to use to get to where you need to go. It's also in a safe area with lots of nice restaurants nearby.

We arrived around midday and were told the room wasn't available till around 3pm. When we finally returned we were surprised to be told they had upgraded our room and were offered a much better room on the 16th floor! Room was high enough to enjoy the views and to block out any noise. Yes there is construction work nearby however we really didn't notice the noise. You can't go to NY and expect it to be totally quiet though! Rooms were spacious and fresh towels provided daily. On the one day they forgot to replace them they gave us new ones almost immediately after we rang to notify them. Bathroom size is average but suited our needs. Word of warning to all about the minibar items on the table, we made the mistake of picking up the items only to find there was a 20 sec timer, fortunately we replaced the items swiftly! The two concierges were very friendly (David & David), they both had a great sense of humour and were very patient - even when we did monopolise their time! Both were very helpful and recommended a number of places for us to goto - thanks as I'm sure you will be reading this eventually ;o)!!! Receptionist staff and the doormen were again very friendly - with the exception of one of the receptionists who hasn't learnt the art of smiling yet, you'll know who we mean when you get there!! Be prepared to walk! Central Park took us just under 20 mins to walk to, most of the attractions you can walk to however it is a lengthy walk. I confess we were lazy and ended up getting a taxi most places however we did nonetheless cover a lot of ground by walking! One complaint is the lack of room service. A menu exists within the room information pack however when we rang we were told they don't provide room service. Never did find out whether this was a temporary problem, either way though I think the hotel should remove this information from the rooms. Nonetheless there are so many restaurants/ bars nearby that it was fine. You must however go upstairs to the restaurant to look at the view! Would I recommend this hotel? Yes! Yes this hotel isn't the Hyatt but unless you're prepared to pay those prices don't grumble, you can't expect to pay 3* prices and receive a 5* room!!! Ours was a leisure holiday so we really didn't spend much time in the room, either way it suited our requirements. After spending a couple of nights in/near Times Square we were glad we weren't staying in one of the hotels there as the crowds and noise is unbelievable!

We stayed for a week. The hotel is very unassuming from the outside. If you take a cab or shuttle from an airport to the hotel, your first thought when the vehicle pulls up is probably, \"Huh? We're here?\" The Bentley is located next to a gas station and an animal medical center. Neither of these establishments are a detriment to the atmosphere of the hotel, though. Once inside, the lobby is bright, clean, and hip-looking. Off to one side of the lobby is a cappuccino bar. Online, the bar is featured as a 24-hour cappuccino bar, but when we went down for coffee in the middle of the afternoon, it was unattended and no coffee was available. The bar is by no means a fancy cafe; rather, it isn't much more than an espresso machine. The staff is generally helpful with any bags you might have. Housekeeping is hit or miss. They do tidy the room every time, in addition to changing the sheets, but several times, they removed our dirty towels and didn't leave us with an entire set of clean ones. There were two of us, and at one point, we had no wash cloth and only one bath towel. One morning, we had maintenance knock on our door at least three times asking to come in and change the mirror (switched out for an identical mirror...?), and the last time, when we didn't answer quickly enough, the guy barged in and quickly apologized when he saw that we were still occupying the room. The rooms are nice, and air-conditioned. The beds are very comfortable, with ample pillows. The bathroom does not have a fan, and I believe that this led to the mildew or mold in our shower. The water did not drain from the tub quickly, so showers were taken in ankle-deep standing water. The water gets warm enough for a shower, but never truly hot. The view from our 10th-floor room was very nice, overlooking the river and other high-rise buildings that give the place a \"big city\" feeling. On our last day, the doorman offered to have a driver take us to the airport, which wasn't free, but it did save us a good amount of money versus taking a cab or shuttle. In all, the Bentley is just fine if you're spending time exploring the city, and even if you want to lounge around the room a bit. We spent a good amount of time in the room, and it was enjoyable and comfortable.

I need not have worried - we were greeted - in the middle of a thunderstorm and torrential rain - by friendly and efficient staff who gave us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite on the 20th. floor - I had requested a room with a good view and it was exactly that. Plenty of space, clean and comortable beds, everything worked in the bathroom. We knew in advance about the off centre location but after a day of being busy tourists in New York it was actually rather relaxing to walk 10-15 minutes (downhill) back to the hotel from the subway (taxi can be used as a very reasonable alternative for two or more people) and I felt it was preferable to the noisy and (very) expensive midtown options I had considered. The location of the gas station by the hotel was so minor a feature that it took 24 hours to realise it was there. Slight niggles would be the fact that there was _some_ traffic noise (but, hey, this is Manhattan - what do you expect?), closet space was a little limited, the lifts could be slow in arriving at busy times and the air conditioning was rather noisy and not in the first flush of youth.

The restaurant area was a big let down, the space & its location in the building could be turned into something quite special instead of a random collection of chairs and tables, it lacked atmosphere & character hence it was deserted most meal times, the cost of the self service buffet breakfast probably puts people off - a real shame Lifts were so slow to arrive. The hotel location is fair, our room suffered badly with traffic noise from the FDR/surface roads/Roosevelt bridge, it's smack in the middle of the on/off ramps for the FDR (6 lane highway) - there was a constant drone. A fuel station is attached to the building, this didn't cause a problem as such but it did create extra traffic with obligatory horn honking for no good reason. Subway is a brisk 15 minutes walk away, 59st Lexington is the best option taking any train marked R or W will get you to the centre of it all the main activities. There are a fair number of places to eat locally, breakfast at Ritz diner served us well, $5 for scrambled eggs, bacon, smashed potatoes & endless coffee was value for money with good service. Overall the hotel was good with a few problems, with hindsight I'd probably have tried harder to get closer to central park & further south, walking can take it out of you especially if you have to wait at every crossing. Also buy a MetroCard, we bought 7-day unlimited cards for $25 - great value & can be used on the buses too. The auto-vend machines don't like UK credit cards, cash or debit cards are fine.

It was recommended to us by a previous visitor and also seemed to be the lowest cost hotel in NYC that got consistently good reviews on Tripadvisor. We flew into Newark and got thoroughly ripped off by the Airport taxis (60 bucks, plus \"tolls\" where the tolls come to nearly one hundred dollars!!). The hotel arranged us a car to go back at less than half the cost, so it's worth giving them a call to see if they can pick you up! The hotel is located on the Upper East Side, right by the Queensborough Bridge. It's not a bad area, but the hotel is right by a busy road - it's well worth asking for the highest room you can get to avoid the traffic noise. We where on the 20th floor and it was fine. One the last day they moved us to a suite on the 12th floor and it was much noisier. Everywhere in NY is busy, so this is likely to apply to any hotel. The room was excellent. Very clean, comfy bed, big chairs, LCD TV and nice bathroom. Great to come back to after a busy day. The suite we got on the last day, although bigger, did not really offer any extra so I would keep your money - the standard rooms are fine. The reception was efficient and the staff friendly and polite - no complaints. We only had one problem; the hairdryer broke and they came and fixed it within 5 minutes of calling. We didn't eat there at all so can't comment. Like everybody else we went to the Ritz Diner for breakfast which is really good. It's located one block up E62nd street on the corner of 1st - it seems to have a more expensive menu at the weekends for some reason. There's also a great pizza parlour just around the corner next to Dangerfields and a \"7-11\" round the other corner. The nearest subway is either on 51st and Lexington (next to Bloomingdales) for the track down towards the Brooklyn Bridge and Central Station or 63rd and Lexington for Midtown. Both are about 10 minutes away. My advise would be to get a subway map (ask at any subway) and a ticket to last you your stay.

The place is, in a word, stingy. How else can you explain - don't even think about using the word justify - these quirky surprises: 1. One washcloth in the bathroom the day we arrived. None the next day, so I tracked housekeeping down and asked for two. One the next day. Ditto for our last day. And only two bath towels each day. 2. A sign on the in-room refrigerator (I have a photo, so you know I'm not kidding!) warns you that if an item is taken from the refrigerator for more than 20 seconds, you will be charged for it - and if you place any item of yours in the refrigerator, you will be charged, too! 3. An $11.95 (plus tip) breakfast buffet that is laughable even by New York City standards. Coffee, juice, toast, min-bagels, mini-muffins and three small bowls of fruit (emptied and not refilled while I was there) and some bananas complete the menu-- which reads much more appetizing than it was! The tired furniture, carpet and non-existent d\u00c3\u00a9cor don't add much to the 21st floor room, which is about as interesting as the inside of an empty warehouse. And speaking of d\u00c3\u00a9cor, do not expect your deluxe room to look like the deluxe room showcased on the website. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was deluxe, the fellow at the check in counter explained, because it had a king size bed in it. I find that curious. What about size? Closet space? View? Amenities? I guess \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd excludes those qualities and characteristics at the Bentley. The room was small, even by New York City standards. The miniscule closet is a bit wider than its door. The light on the built-in shelf-counter-cum-desk was broken. The closest light to the reading chair was a table lamp (with a dim fluorescent bulb) on the nightstand. Fortunately, the chair was next to the only window in the room, so we could read by daylight. When I asked to be moved because I didn't like the room or the view, the desk clerk told me he would call back in a few minutes. When he didn't, I called him. He said he was busy. I went downstairs and waited until he wasn't busy and then asked him, as politely as I could, if we could change rooms. That was not possible, he said, because the hotel was filled that night-Friday. I could wait until in the morning and see what was available\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6unless I wanted to move to the second floor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6overlooking the gas station and sets of gas pumps (and traffic) that are part of the first floor of the Bentley. I declined. When I had called (on Thursday) to confirm our pre-paid reservations, the Bentley had no record of us. Eventually, I was told we had a standard room, which I challenged because we had paid for a deluxe room (a difference of $150 for three nights). When I talked to the desk clerk about my dissatisfaction with the room, he told me it was a standard room. I disagreed, and said we had paid for a deluxe room. He very quickly (too quickly, for my taste) agreed that yes, it was a deluxe room. Had this been a first class, customer-friendly organization, I would have expected a call Saturday morning, offering to move us to another room -- any room almost! There was no message.

I travelled with my wife and 14 year old daughter on a sightseeing/ shopping trip. There were no problems at all with this hotel apart from the fact that it is a bit of a trudge from the nearest subway (lexington/59th street) at the end of a long day with lots of shopping bags! In hindsight, we should have taken more cabs ( these are unbelievably plentiful and easy to hail)but you always forget how tired you were the day before. If you are fairly fit and enjoy walking, then this hotel is for you. It is about 15 minutes to the subway and Lexington Avenue, where there are lots of shops and another 10 minutes or so to Central Park so you are not that far away from the action. The Ritz diner was where we had breakfast every morning on the way to the subway and we found it terrific value with a fantastic breakfast menu. Our fair sized room was on the 16th floor and, although the air conditioning was a bit loud, we were so tired that it did not affect our sleeping. We had two comfortable double beds and a nice TV. The bathroom was perhaps a little small but it was clean enough and sufficent for our needs. The corridors and lifts are pretty dark. In fact, in the lift you can hardly see the floor numbers! Also, I am always suspicious when there is a really strong smell of perfumed air or air freshener in the corridors. You keep wondering what they have to hide! I have to say my suspicions proved to be unfounded and the surroundings were very pleasant. We had few dealings with the hotel staff but when we did, they were helpful, efficient and courteous e.g. storing our luggage for us on the final day and ordering a taxi for the airport. Our favourite things to do a) take the subway to High Street, Brooklyn and then walk back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge. Great views of the Manhattan skyline and it is free! b) Go to the Top of the Rock observatory at the Rockefeller centre for fantastic 360 degree views. This costs about $17 but is worth the money and, by all accounts, better than the Empire State Building which, incidentally, you can see very clearly. c) Explore the area around Washington Square, (the arch where Harry gets dropped off by Sally after she gives him a lift and he says \"Have a nice life\") preferably south and west of that landmark, where there are some quirky shops, great bars and restaurants.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGive this place a try!\u201d", "Author": "Eyelashtravels", "ReviewID": "UR10247901", "Content": "Stayed in the Bentley for a few nights on business.

This proved to be a life saver as late nites of drinking led to dry mouths and a shop at your doorstep is brilliant.

I would not pay more than $300 for this hotel on weekday business travel and $250 for weekend leisure travel in the spring, summer and fall. You will find better value in the winter elsewhere, as weekend prices tend to drop at 4 star hotels in Manhatten. The hotel location on the east side of Manhatten is not too bad for a NYC vacation or business trip, if you don't mind being a bit off of the beaten path. The rooms have flat screen TV's and a modern feel but nothing extrordinary. The bathrooms are clean but a bit cramped like the room.

My girlfriend enjoyed watching the burly firemen for the hour we stood outside! It also afforded us a stark reminder of 9/11 with the memorial on the fire truck. On arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite and had a corner room - unfortunately overlooking the gas station next door. The room was only let down by three things - the air con/ heating was mediocre (thankfully we had unseasonably warm weather), the bathroom was tired and small and the closet space was non existent - we ended up living out of our bags on the floor. Mind you, how long do you stay in your room when you've the whole of NY to explore? The best aspect of the hotel is without a doubt the bar & restaurant on the top floor overlooking the East River and The Queensboro Bridge - a truly fantastic view of night time Manhattan can be seen from the bar. The hotel is ideal for exploring the Upper East Side neighbourhood and Central Park isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that far away. Be prepared to walk - the places aren't too close; don't be put off by a 10 Block walk (it's not that far really). A word of note; if you only staying for a couple of days and it's your first time in New York I'd suggest a hotel closer to midtown as it's not too central - but if you are an old hand at visiting NYC then that's part of the attraction for the Bentley as it gives another aspect to the city and there are some good restaurants near by.

I went out for the day, and when I returned around 6 pm, I was told that there was a technical problem with the room key card system and I would have to wait for a bellman to let me into the room. In a few minutes, I was shown to my room, but the bellman just let me in - I was given keys, but they didn't work. I went out for a bite to eat and when I returned, the fellow at the front desk (clearly under stress since others couldn't get into their rooms) told me that my lock had been fixed just moments after I left the hotel, and I was given another set of key cards. I went up to the room and the cards didn't work. I returned to the lobby, was sent back up to the room with a bellman, who couldn't open the door. Back to the lobby. With considerable attitude, the desk clerk escorted me to my room with the master control box and told me that he was reprogramming the lock. I got into the room and was given two keys. I went out to see friend later in the evening, and when lI returned at midmight, that key card didn't work. This time, it took three trips to the room with hotel staff, and twenty minutes later I was finally in my room - with no working keys. The next morning, a very kind hotel manager apologized, promised to have the keys working, and told me that the Sunday staff should have notified her of the problem over the weekend, but didn't. Fact of the matter was, when I returned later in the day, the keys I was given still didn't work. Finally, the manager herself came to the room and get the system to work. When I returned later that evening from dinner, my hallway had five kids sitting on the floor with their suitcases. When I asked what was going on, they told me they couldn't get into their rooms (this was at 11 pm).

Bentley was a very good surprise. Hotel is in 62th @ York avenue, so It is NOT in the centre of things, but the east side is a very nice neighborhood with many options to eat and walk. We got a nice room ( finished in 01) in the 8th floor, with a nice view of the east river, a Window ceil to floor allowed us to see the Queensboro bridge at front and the river. I asked for a higher floor and they promised me in three days, but actually we stayed in the 8th floor. Rooms were very clean with bed & linens Ok, changed everyday. Marble bathrooms, nice shower. Flat screen TV, small closets. Acces to WiFi through a provider costs 30$ the week, was reliable( daily or hourly acces is too priced ). We actually use internet to plan each day due the fact we got bad weather ( rainy and cold below 8C) first four days and very good one the last four days...( sunny and above 20C). Noise early in the moorning but not too noisy. There is a small fridge ....Do Not Touch it, if you get a bottle from the fridge just to see what it is you will be charged. Complimentary self capuccino ( or tea ) is available at the small reading room besides the Lobby, where daily newspapers and magazines are available.

Roof top Restaurant is a simple place to take a drink to see the river @ night, we did not eat there ( breakfast and dinner was offered) it is nothing too special, but it worth a night visit to drink a cosmo if you are going to stay. YES, Bentley iss a little bit off, nearest Subway station is 6 blocks away @ lexington with 59st ( six lines) or lexington with 63st. ( F line) . Getting to Central Park is 10 blocks away. but the walk is in a nice neighborhood. I believe that is the only reason this hotel is still at 200$+ night. Taxi Cab from Midtown / Downtont to Bentley were 10$ average at night. I do believe that these extra 10$ each day are much less that the extra 100$/ day that costs a good hotel in theater District that compares with Bentley. Few hints if you stay in Bentley: - walk to River View Terrace, to amazing views of Queensboro bridge & river . 3 blocks from Bentley. - Madison Avenue & the museum Mile are \"near\" the hotel, for a good walk day. We found a gem in the museum mile: neue gallery museum. German & Austrian ExpresSionist. Right now: \"Van Gogh & the expressionism\" is in display. amazing. - lots of good coffes to take breakfast. The Nearest the Ritz Dinner. If you want somethingh very hip: EAT Caffe @ Park avenue with 81. Best breakfast we had in town. fresh pastry and bakery, everything good. - tram to Roosevelt Island is 3 blocks away, nothing spectacular as it is a 4 minute raid, but if you stay in Bentley with Queensboro bridge at your side and you see the tram every day almost right @ your window, you have to ride on it.... ;-) - United Nations Building is few minutes walking down by 1st avenue. - we took dinner near Bentley just one night.

It is besides east river caffe almost hidden: \"Cuccina Tuscana\" or something like that. in summary, Bentley is a good hotel, NOT in the middle of things, but for NYC it is reasonably priced in a stylish decor,with nice & clean rooms. Rooms with views to the river & queensboro are something different that add this \"additional touch\" to the stay in the HOtel. Friendly staff, nothing to complain. YES for a long stay i will return. For a very short stay in NYC maybe you could prefer a more \"Middle of the action\" hotel, with tons of people, subway stations, neon lights surrounding....It is up to you. hopes this help-.", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely clean hotel but noisey surrounding\u201d", "Author": "dinochomper", "ReviewID": "UR7494293", "Content": "When my friend and I arrived the room we were allocated to was on the fourth floor, although the room was spacious and clean the noise level was horrendous.

My friend and I had a double bed each which had duvets and sheets - very comfortable bed. The only down side to our room was that the bathroom was a little small but adequate. The only thing that was missing was a extractor fan because everytime you used the shower the room steamed up so you need to keep the bathroom door open. One advice is to have a shower/bath in the a.m. because in the evening there is no hot water! There is a mini bar in the room and on top of the mini bar are crisps, chocolates etc. If you pick them up more than 20 seconds you will be billed. My advice is before you leave the hotel to return home check that you have not been billed - the same goes for the mini bar - don't open the door more than 20 seconds. You get cleaners coming everyday to replace your towels and generally tidy your room. We had a good panaramic view of the Queensborough Bridge and you can see the river (obviously depending where your room is). There is a cocktail bar on the 21st floor with a great view of the river and bridge. The waiters are very friendly. Also every a.m. you can have breakfast on the 21st floor - which is buffet style - personally I didn't think it was worth the money, you better off going to a american dinner which you will get a lot more for your money. Downstairs in the lobby you can help yourself to coffee (different types) and tea anytime you like.

Nice lobby. -\"Deluxe\" room much smaller than advertised & featured no \"city or bridge view\" as promised. -Several interruptions during our stay. Inconsiderate staff. -Nothing \"deluxe\" about the televisions in the \"deluxe\" rooms. -Horrendous, stressful parking situation. Not helpful at all. Read on for details... The Lobby is nice and the doormen & bag carriers even nicer. Very pleasant & helpful. However, this was decieving... We were extremely disappointed when we got to our room. We booked a \"deluxe\" room based on the pictures they advertised on the website we were booking from. We paid for a \"deluxe\" room but there was nothing \"deluxe\" about it. I think if we ordered the standard room, it would have been the same- just cheaper. Deluxe rooms are supposed to feature beautiful views (higher floors), but we were put on the third floor facing an ugly building..no view at all. The website boasts that the rooms are \"over-sized\" but I would consider our \"deluxe\" room small. We were interupted many times during our stay... (3 to be exact) 1. We had a room all the way in a corner tucked away from other rooms & elevators etc. on the third floor, which we thought would be nice and quiet, but we were awakened several times. It seems that when the staff goes into the \"employees only\" staff doors all around the hotel (linen closets, electrical control closets, etc.) during the night and early morning when people are trying to sleep, they are unaware that slamming the doors can be very disturbing to the guests who are trying to relax. Other than that the hotel would have been quiet, but we just heard doors slam outside our room all night. There is nothing relaxing about that. The staff should be more considerate. 2. The night before, just as we were settling in, two repair men barged into our room (they didn't knock) , apologizing, saying they needed to fix the mini-bar (that we weren't going to use anyway due to the high priced, un-worthy items like a can of amstel light for $6, yes a can.) They spent about 15 minutes messing with it. 3. Then in the early morning we were woken up by several \"tests\" and alarms to the communication system. Someone with a thick accent came on the very loud Public Address System announcing something. We couldn't understand what he was saying (maybe because we were half asleep?) so we had to call the front desk to make sure there was no emergency. There wasn't, but after that several more announcements were made about 20 minutes apart (just as we would begin to fall back asleep, how pleasant.) Then an alarm. By the last interruption we just got out of bed and checked out of there. For a boutique-style hotel, there is nothing swanky or modern about the television in the deluxe rooms. It is completely out-dated, fuzzy and blurry. It gives you a headache looking at it. Overall the picture and sound quality is something I'd expect from a tv in a Motel. The parking situation is also a mess if you bring your car. We pulled up to the hotel & they took our bags inside for us & directed us to the parking lot on the opposite side of the entrance to the hotel. When we pulled in we were told to \"come back later\" because they were full. Full? I just want to check into my room & I have to come back later because you're full? It took us 45 minutes from when we got there to actually get inside due to the parking situation. The front desk was no help. Our bags sat there in the lobby for 45 minutes while we waited outside in our car. The garage is small and cramped. The hotel should take care of the parking of your car when you arrive for the price we were paying to stay there, I've never seen anything like that. We're a young well-traveled couple in our mid-twenties. We have stayed at many hotels.. boutique, 5 star and all in between. This was no gem, I would never stay here again.

Having booked a non-smoking room on-line (average of $300/night) we were somewhat disappointed to get a much smaller and even smoky room. Only because of the late hour and as we were tired, we accepted, but moved the next day to a similar smoke-free room. The room was much smaller then the one we had during our first stay, but it was functional. The window AC/heating unit has come to age and was a bit noisy. Beds were clean and comfortable, but there was no hot water one morning before 7 am, making a shower an adventure during this time of the year. We suggest that mangement should consider a general overhaul and will probably try another hotel when visiting NYC the next time.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cTrying a bit too hard to be hip\u201d", "Author": "sunnyflies", "ReviewID": "UR6120571", "Content": "I liked this hotel, but it has some shortcomings it ought to address. While my corner room was fresh, spacious and nicely decorated in a contemporary style and had a comfortable bed, the three roman blinds covering the enormous glass windowed walls did not extend all the way down. They stopped 8 inches short of the window sills along two walls, creating a broad opening half way around the room, negating a sense of privacy. With apartment buildings across the way, this is an issue. The long, wide opening also made the room very bright in the early morning and sleeping beyond dawn difficult. One blind was broken and stayed permanently lowered, so that I could not lift it at all. The other two went up easily, giving me a beautiful view up and down First Avenue and with it a feeling of real delight in being back in New York. Whoever designed the elevators was trying too hard to be hip and lost sight of common sense. The cars are painted black inside and are ridiculously poorly lit. They have tiny low watt, recessed lights, one in each corner of the ceiling, making them very dark - especially at night - and making it hard to see the buttons to operate them. Hallways tend to be too dark as well and the vases hung on the walls seem to loom out of nowhere which is an odd feeling. If the halls were better lit, it would be easier to appreciate the smaller vases hung on each door with a single flower in them. Hip and dark at night clubs are one thing, but dark elevators and halls are not suitable for a hotel when travelers are often tired or jet lagged. Although The Bentley offers dinner room service, it does not offer breakfast, nor does it have coffee-makers in the room. Fortunately, the Ritz Diner is jast a block away for a very New York eating experience. It's fun, almost like being in a TV or movie set. The hotel seems to be popular with Europeans and is a comfortable walking distance to excellent shopping, restaurants and major hospitals.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Niels2", "ReviewID": "UR5961034", "Content": "I stayed for three nights at The Bentley and had a great trouble-free stay.

We had read all the reviews so requested rooms as high as we could get but we didn't arrive till 1030pm so there wasn't much going. The male receptionist, who was initially a little frosty but soon warmed up, gave us some rooms on the 4th floor, then moved us to the 7th floor. Our room was right across from the lifts but actually I never heard the lifts at all, or people in the corridor. The only unfortunate thing was we had an adjoining (locked) door to the next room and some mad scottish woman was in there who not only spoke loudly but smoked as well, so we had the smell coming through the adjoining door. When we had first arrived in the room it smelled very strongly of cleaning fluids, then as that wore off I realised we were in a smoking room but it wasn't too bad as we didn't spend too much time in our room really. The bathrooms were clean, plenty of clean towels left and the beds made every day. Our room overlooked the corner of East 62nd and 1st Ave and it seemed to be the thoroughfare for the bridge. The noise of the traffic itself is like a background hum which you soon get used to but the worse thing is the honking. I was awoken at 530am our first morning due to this and the worst of it goes on till about 930/1000am. (Rush Hour I guess, as at the weekend it was quieter) Nearest tube (Metro) station was only 5/6 diagonal blocks, taxies were easy to get right outside the hotel, Central Park was walking distance. Taxi Fare to Time Square was approx $12, Metro Fare $7 for all day travel. Be aware when travelling by taxi that you need to give yourself plenty of time due to traffic hold ups. We nearly missed the start of our Broadway Show. There are some decent restaurants and bars quite close to the Hotel, we discovered O'Flanaghans quite by accident and had an absolutely magnificent steak cooked to perfection, then a band came on at 11pm and we ended up staying till 2am, brilliant night. The lead singer of the band used to sing with FatBack Band, terrific music. The hallways are 'moody', the free coffee and tea in reception was very welcome, and the staff were helpful. The room we had was small but looking at some of the pictures on this site there are bigger, better rooms. I think it is just luck of the draw unless you have actually paid more for a 'deluxe' room.

My boyfriend and I got a great last minute deal through expedia for $179.00 a night, and we booked the week before. I shoudl note that in New York, hotel prices aren't fixed so you could pay this much for one week and $900 a night another week. Bizarre. Anyway, the hotel is in a great location--62nd and York, right by the 59th Street Bridge. Though the area does not appear residential when you arrive, it is if you walk one block to 1st street, where there are tons of restaurants and stores (lots of pizza places to the south of the bridge). We loved walking most places. The nearest subway stop is a bit of a walk (10 minutes?), at 3rd and 59th (it's actually the Lexington and 59th street stop, but there is an entrance on third) and from there you can go just about anywhere. I like staying in this area because you get a real feel for new york. The hotel itself is modern looking and the staff are friendly. upon arrival, our bags were taken immediately, and we could check in right away at 2 pm. we were upgraded to a king sized bed from a queen. The room was a decent size with teeny tiny but nice bathroom. I was surprised by the lack of a safe--especially since there was a space for one, but when we asked the front desk, they told us that only about 20 rooms had safes. that bothered me, being in new york at what was designed to look like a fancy boutique hotel. We had to ask twice for towels when the shower sprayed outside teh curtain and soaked one, but otherwise the room was clean and comfortable and nice to stay in, though with a dimly lit bathroom. Also, the elevators and hallways were dimly lit--dark would almost be a better descrtiption--with a weird flower motif, but that's them trying to be trendy and it was more entertaining than anything else. Overall, i was very please staying in the area so inexpensively, this is the second time i've stayed, and i would definitely stay again. Good for people who want to see what it's like living in manhattan rather than staying downtown.

TROUBLE When we got to the hotel, the staff asked us if we wanted a smokers or a non smokers room (although we had already booked a non smoking room). Turns out that the non-smoking rooms were all booked and we were offered to stay one night in a smokers room and then have a non-smoking room the next night. Actually, we told them that we would check the room out and then decide. The room smelled a lot like cleaning products, but not so much of smoke, so we agreed to stay there for one night. Although I wonder what would have happened if we had refused...? In the morning however, when the smell of cleaning products had disappeared, we could definately smell the smoke to the point that our clothes smelled of it. We notified the staff and they gave us another room when we were out that day. It worked out OK for us, but for someone sensitive to smoke, this is unacceptable. 2. ROOMS We had the chance to try out two rooms during our stay. The first one was on the ninth floor, facing the queensborough bridge, the other one was on the 17th floor, straight above the first room, but with an additional window towards the East River. My guess is that this window is there from floor 14 and above. We booked a deluxe room (since it was actually cheaper than the standard room at the time), but the first room we stayed in was probably a STANDARDroom. It had a microwave oven, a combined CD-player and alarm clock, a 20\" TV, a closet, an ironing board and possibly an flatiron. I guess the second room we got was a DELUXE room (not a suite!) because in addition to the standard room it had a flatiron, a fridge, a sink with faucet, a safe (great!) and a complimentary glossy magazine. Oh, and both rooms have air-conditioning with on/off switch, hot or cold air. It's a bit noisy, but it does the job. Otherwise, both rooms are clean, the furniture is stylish and comfortable, the bathroom is clean too and from what I understand above NY standard. 3. SERVICE There are always staff in the Lobby, and they're alwas helpful and nice. The rooms were cleaned every day. The library in the stylish lobby offers free newspapers and tourist information, and there is a self-service coffee bar where you can get regular tea or coffee, espresso, cappucino, different varieties of decaf and so on from a machine with fresh coffee beans and fresh milk. It's nice to have a cup when you come home from an exhausting day of sightseeing. We visited the rooftop bar only during daytime, but the view was stunning. 4. LOCATION If you're used to walking, like we are, walking to central park is easy (even if it's hot out) and takes about 10 mins if you walk slowly. The hotel is close to bloomingdales and other shopping on Lexington ave (where there's also a subway station). The blocks around 58th street / 1st ave have a lot of good restaurants and a couple of cool shops, inluding Terence Conran.

This is the ambiance that the hotel is going for but even we, a creative couple in our late 20's, found it too dark to even read our room number. Alas, we found our room and were pleased. Super clean, modern and a nice view of the Queensboro Bridge. Great room size and the air conditioning worked well to cool us off in the +100F heat. The shower temperature and pressure were great. When we returned from exploring the city every night, our room was always nicely cleaned up for us. New hand and body towels, new soap and shampoo... however, our face cloth was never replaced after the first day (not that we really cared!)

Many of you say that the location is too far from everything, however you can hop on the M31 bus and it will take you into the hub of things. New York is best seen on foot, I think anyway. Tons of great restaurants (and a comedy club) are easily within walking distance. We found the Ritz Diner to be very convenient and open 24 hours, with an ATM as well. The rooftop terrace and restaurant were quite nice. Good cocktails and the service was prompt. We had dinner one night and the food was quite good (try the steak) at a reasonable price. The rooftop terrace had great views but be careful walking on the planks... they were very rickety. We also found that a lot of the furniture in the lobby and the rooms (side tables, chairs, couches in the lobby) were a bit worn and could use an upgrade but were still in presentable shape. We found the hotel very quiet at night in our rooms (no noise from other rooms.) The snack and drink machines were always sparse when we had late night munchies but the Mobil station just on the corner proved a better replacement anyway.

Both the bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean and cleaned every day with fresh towels. Staff were friendly and there when you needed them but otherwise left you alone. Check in and check out was very quick and hassle free. Sometimes the lobby is full of school/travel groups but they were not there for long. The lifts were very slow to arrive on the ground floor especially if the third one was being reserved for staff only which made things very difficult on occasion. Yes lighting is dim in the hallway and lifts but so what. The airconditioning in our room was very noisy (possibly left over from the building's days as an office block?). We turned it off at night. Could sometimes hear noise from other rooms especially where we had an interconnecting door but it didn't go on late and we could only hear it near the window. Bring a face cloth with you as only one provided for the room. We brought a travel kettle as coffee available from the lobby which is fine when you are returning from a day out but not good for first thing in the morning. The walk of 7 blocks to Central Park is a nice one and not too far. Cabs are cheap to anywhere touristy and it is nice to stay in a hotel in a quieter, residential area. We had breakfast every morning at the Ritz Dinner which is on 1st Avenue one block up 62nd street directly from the Hotel. Very convenient. Go after 9am when the rush is over. Lots of places to eat on 1st and 2nd Avenues. We didn't eat or drink at the restaurant but the view was amazing and it seemed a very relaxing place to spend an evening.

The hallways are lit more like a nightclub than a hotel. I have good eyesight and I had to strain to see the room numbers. It's not a reason not to stay here, but the halls are unusually dark for a hotel. On the other hand, at night my third floor room might have been brighter than the hallways. That was because there were bright lights coming from the windows of an adjacent building (or section of the building) and the curtain was not quite large enough. The top half of the bed was getting so much light that I ended up sleeping nearly horizontally (king size bed) to avoid it. It was also a little noisy, but it wasn't all that bad. Some of the wood furniture had the finish worn off of it in places, so don't expect anything especially posh.

If so, that would be a bargain. I paid almost $200 a night and at that rate, I probably wouldn't reserve unless I could get them to guarantee a higher floor.

I have to say that after reading some of the reviews I was a wee bit concerned but we had a lovely stay. The animal hospital was there, yes, but it didn't infringe on the hotel or our stay AT ALL & the gas station was on the other side but again NO negative impact ( in fact quite handy for late night snacks to go along with the free tea & coffee that was always available from the library!!) The rooms are immaculate & ALL of the staff are so friendly & willing to help you get the most from your stay. Ask Sam or Adda at the door for help, they were fab!! The complimentary body lotion is lovely, you should try some. Plenty of fresh towels every day! The location was nice, we felt safe walking at night & on exploring did get a taste of some real New York living. However, I would say that it is quite a way into the centre of the action ( Times Square etc) and if you are not fully fit & able for a good 30 minute walk each way then you need to use the cabs ( about $10 including the tip) as even the nearest subway was about 10-15 minutes walk. My only negative would be the sound proofing of the rooms.This could be improved a little as we could sometimes hear TV & things from next door but we could have had a deaf neighbour & this was not through the night or anything!!

I booked this hotel with one of our suppliers for the price yes and for the fact that on the 21st floor it showed a beautiful restuarant overlooking the Queensborough Bridge. The famous restuarant was still not open for business till now March even though I rang the hotel in January and was assured it would be open for Valentines Week. After reading all the reports on Trip advisor I have to say I was worried sick on what was going to greet me when i arrived at The Bentley Hotel. Yes it is right next to the Animal rescue centre and Yes there is a Gas station right up against the windows of reception. I did a bit of dectective work and it seems that the building used to be offices which is why it still looks that way from the outside. Inside it is airy in recept and our room 1911 on the 19th Floor was large but even that high up with only single glazing the traffic noise is terrible. The bathroom was beautifully laid out and the piping hot water was nice too but with the lack of any extractor fan in the bathroom as soonas you opened the door the whole bedroom would fill with steam and hence huge amounts of condensation filled the room. Now normally you would think thats ok I will open the window but not here there was no wsmall window at all just 2 huge single glazed windows. The heating worked on a mind of its own, staying there for the worst cold spell this year it wasn't even luke warm and on the days it reached 60f outside we came into the room with the heating on full. Most descriptions give teh Bentley stating mini bars yes you get the cupboard where it should be but no bar and as no restuarant there was little else to do but eat out all the time. The free coffee machine in reception hardley ever worked and the bar for recption is a marble slab, with a man sitting behind it with a few infact 4 bottles of spirits and a bucket withabout 10 bottles of beer in it. I was not amused as were many of the americans staying at the hotel also. Aside from all this the cleaning of our room was perfect and the bed was fanstatic to sleep in...But as for giving the hotel 3*** I would find that very hard t do maybe 2** but no more than that. I travel the globe with my job and it certainly didnt come up to the standards that I was held to believe it had in both its offical description and its star rating. Depending on how many red lights you were held up with the Lexington subway was 10-20 mins walk. Diners: Burger Heaven,Tramway.

The outside appearance on arrival did nothing to dispel that impression, but suprisingly, the rooms were clean and sophisticated, and the linens were lovely.

But if you only need a clean, comfortable, esthetically pleasing room, and don't necessarily need the ammenities of a four-star hotel, this little boutique hotel fits the bill.

I found this out myself on this site afterwards. A standard room is just that, a clean if not small room, because it only sleeps two people. With a nice bathroom and not nessasarily with a view of the river. We had only paid for a standard room because our tour operator didnt advise us otherwise. However, when we signed in, I asked the receptionist if she could give us a big bed, because me and my husband are both big and we were going to be in that bed for some time. She smiled as if she understood and then looked at our room number on the computer. She said she would change the room to another one higher up with a bigger bed. The room was lovely. It was spotlessly clean, towels changed everyday and bed sheets changed regularly. A free safe which is unusual since they normally charge. Hairdryer in the bathroom ( which by the way was spotless ) iron and ironing board! A C.D. player by the bed along with the telephone. An ice bucket with two glasses.

The decor reminded me a bit of some boutique hotels I've booked in L.A. and Miami. I stayed on the 6th floor right off the elevator lobby area. The room was a nice size (for NYC) and offered a desk, a chair, a closet. The linens were clean and comfy. The bath was large and had wonderful lighting. It was quite roomy. I didn't mind the walk b/c I had acknowledged when i booked. I ate in the restaurant that evening and enjoyed the Vodka Penne Chicken dish. Pricing seemed reasonable.

About the hotel itself -- it is located in a quieter section of Manhattan. But, nowhere in NYC is absolutely quiet. In fact, every hotel I have stayed at has been noisy to some extent, so I always bring earplugs. Though I was concerned about the noise level after reading some reviews, I was glad to not share some others' experiences. I slept like a baby. That said, the hotel room had some minor defects. First, my bathroom sink had three large cracks though they were already repaired -- it wasn't a pretty sight. Second, the TV plug was slightly bent and sparked when I plugged it into a different outlet. Third, the iron's dial (heat setting) was gone -- so it worked on my cotton-based clothes, but I had never encountered that experience before. The hotel front desk was always well-staffed and friendly. The hotel has over 20 floors and 2 elevators. The hotel decor was ok. The hotel room decor was ok -- although the window blind was very wrinkled, looked cheap and shabby, was a dab brown color, and did not cover the whole window. There is no business office. (But, NYC tourist fact -- there is free Internet Access at the Times Square Information Center next to the Loews Theater -- several computers that feature Yahoo Mail. But, there is some wait.).

The hotel wasn't the ritz, but i went to see new york and not too stay in my hotel room the entire time.

The rooms were a very good size and somewhat of an unusal shape, but they were a nice size to relax and unwind in, the bathroom was again quite nice, it wasn't the ritz, but as the hotel never claimed to be it had me impressed as i didn't go there with any expectations. The only main gripe i had was about the waiting staff when i ordered a meal, he was more concerned with chatting at the bar and practically threw the menu at me, not very friendly, but i only dined there once so don't know if this was standard behaviour. The views in the morning were worth the price of the hotel, a nice breeze and breathing in the fresh air on the riverside made for a nice way to wake up and appreicate the city, be warned for the mobil station, it is not very well signposted what is pavement and what is forecourt, so be wary of getting run over. Location is quite good for the park, and as i went in summer it is a pleasant walk to the subway for downtown, just be carefull of getting caught up shopping in time square till 1am then getting a subway and walking the couple of blocks back in the dark. Favourite part was the food emporium over the road, very nice and holiday esq feel to it. All in all, i would not say this hotel was anything spectacular, but it was a hotel with character, it gave me some tales to tell when i came home to my friends and there is nothing about it that i would say ruined my holiday, it was very well priced and i would definatly stay again.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay at the Bentley\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3495071", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay at The Bentley in New York.

The first night we found only one, even though two people were listed on the reservation, and we had two beds. The next morning I left a note with the tip, asking for 2 wash clothes each night through Sunday. The next two nights were fine, but Saturday night we returned wet from an unexpected rain shower only to find no (zero) wash clothes.

We didn't have a vacation this past summer, so we decided to stay in NY for a nice, fun weekend. On our first day there we received excellent, friendly service from the staff. To our surprise, there was a major storm coming the day after, so we decided to make our first night a night out. We went shopping all morning through the afternoon, had dinner, then came back to the hotel to get ready. Unfortunately our time there went sour when the vents stopped blowing hot air, and the hot water ran out just as we are getting ready to go out at around 10pm. We called the front desk to see what the problem was and they told us the hotel was having problems with the hot water, and that it should be getting fixed soon. The windows in our room began to fog up and even froze on the inside (it was that cold). After an hour of constantly calling the front desk, I decided to go downstairs and request to be moved either to a different suite that had heat and hot water, or to be moved to another one of their hotels in NY with a comparable room. They agreed to move us to a different hotel at 11:30pm, and even paid for the cab ride. They checked us into a filthy, badly decorated, tacky hotel near by, and our room wasn't even a suite. It was 12 midnight at this point and we were exhausted and carrying all our shopping bags plus luggage. They couldn't move us to a comparable hotel because they were all booked, so I asked for them to refund us our money and we would find a hotel ourselves at this point. After calling around NY for the cheapest place we could stay that wasn't dirty, we found a regular room at a Marriott for about $30 more than we were going to pay for a suite at the Bentley. We got to the Marriott a little before 1:00am, and we were so exhausted and hungry, we ordered pizza, then fell asleep to a movie. We didn't even get to go out to a bar or club because our second night there, there was a huge snow storm, and the third day we had to go home early because my best friend's father had died of a heart attack the night before. Because of the huge inconvenience the Bentley caused us on our first night, I spoke with someone from management, and he told me he was going to see what he could do, but after a month of waiting for his phone call, someone else calls back and says that all they can do for us is give us $30 dollars off our next night there, since that is the difference for what we paid for the Marriott. They couldn't do anything for us for the inconvenience they caused us. So to say the least I wasn't very pleased with how management handled the situation. Come to find out, we weren't the only ones that suffered from lack of heat and no hot water, but everyone staying that busy weekend, and some people even lacked electricity in part of their room.

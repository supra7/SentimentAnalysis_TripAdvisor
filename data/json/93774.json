The location was decent, most staff was friendly, but the accommodations were terrible! We rented an ocean front room with a king bed in a seperate bedroom and a queen bed and sofa bed in the other. The sofa covers were soiled, sand was visible on most furniture surfaces, the bathroom sink was half way torn off the wall, the bath tub/shower was rusted in most cracks and corners, the stove had a burner that wouldn't stay down, and the door separating the living areas looked like it had been punched in. In addition, we had to walk thru the bedroom to access the other living area which defeated the idea of privacy. If we used the sofa bed we had to sacrifice access to our ocean front balcany. The main door to our room was difficult to open and close. This was a very disappointing experience and a rip off for the money!

We checked in on Friday, intending to check out on Sunday, but we were having so much fun that we decided to stay another day. When we made our request to add a night to our stay the front desk was extremely flexible and accommodating. We didn't even have to switch rooms! Our room was only steps to the gorgeous beach and it made the walks back and forth so convenient. The hotel pool was small, but warm. very clean and not at all crowded for a holiday weekend. We enjoyed a dip for a change of pace from the beach. Janet at the front desk was pleasant, humorous and very helpful with all of our questions and requests.

The girls above us continually going in and out of the room and hearing the sliding glass door all day and into early morning hours. 3. The couple having sex on the balcony above us... Really??? I'm just glad the kids were already in bed. 4. The smell of pot and the coughing from the floor right above us. Again, glad the kids were asleep.

I researched a lot of hotels and for the week that I was going this was the best value. I think I got a better deal then some people. I booked in June 2012 and stayed from July 29th- August 3rd, 2012. The hotel is located right on the beach, 45h Street. It was nice, little dirty out there but I guess it is expected. I liked how the lifeguard gave safety speeches and called people out of the water to hear them. The hotel is right on the beach bus line which made it easy for traveling up and down the main street. It took about 10-15 minutes depending on traffic to get down to the Boardwalk by bus.The hotel was average. We were on the 3 floor and had a side balcony for a view of the ocean which was fine. The rooms were clean and had a kitchenette. We used the fridge for our drinks etc for the beach. The hotel was older and the halls were painted blue and yellow. The elevator door was fast to close. You had to be quick getting in and out or the door would close on you. Anyways, We were there just to sleep and shower. We were mostly at the beach. The pool closed the early, so no night swimming. I did see the guy checking the pool daily. There was coffee and juice in the mornings, but we went to Layton's and to a little place just down the street called Satellite. So, don't; expect anything big in the lounge area. I guess my only complaint would be the room service. We came back from the beach at 5pm and our room was not even done yet. I took at shower around 5:20 and it was room service. So, after my shower I went downstairs to let them know I am ready for them and they were like house cleaning is done for the day. We had this happen 2x where our room was not done and we are already coming back from our beach day. I over heard people at the pool saying the same thing. I think basically all they did was change towels and make beds. The bed was ok but the other bed kind of sank in the center.

They would take the dirty ones, but not replace them. They have more rooms than parking spots and that was confirmed by the security guard who works the lot at night. They actually called us on Saturday evening to move our truck, but had no where for us to move it to, so we refused! So then we were afraid to leave the property for fear that we would return and not have a place to park! In addition, this place is located on 45th street and the only thing that is really within walking distance with a 9 & 6 year old was Seacrets (for lunch), otherwise there is nothing around here.

As expected no ocean view, but, was disappointed that the rooms are still elevated and have railings preventing direct access to the beach unless you are athletic enough to hop over an approximate 3.5 foot railing with yet another 2 or so feet to go before hitting the ground. Also, all doors except the main entrance are locked at 10PM. This is not unusual for hotels, but, what is unusual is there was no option to unock the other entrances via room key necessetating an extra block walk and treking sand through the lobby. Check-in at 4:00PM was crowded and check-in was slow given it took about 15 minutes to check-in the 4 parties ahead of us. On the plus side, I've stayed in probably 8-10 other hotels in Ocean City and the only one nicer was the Hilton which is literally 3 times more expensive. The hotel was remarkedly sand free given it is beach front; I saw housekeeping using the largest, loudest, most powerful vacumn i've ever seen to clean the hallways daily. The kitchen was just the right size for our needs. The bathroom was kept clean but there were signs of mold developing between the door frame and the shower; again not suprising in an oceanfront property but it will need to be dealt with before it spreads. As stated in the title, it is a great midtown location, about 10-12 blocks from Jolly Roger Amusement Park and only 3 blocks from Seacrets, not to mention easy and inexpensive bus service to the inlet and boardwalk areas.

Place was at capacity. I've stayed at this resort prior to its renovation, so it was nice to see it cleaned up a bit on the exterior and inside the rooms. Didn't update the bathrooms however and they were pretty generic, our shower head was falling out of the wall. To me this is your typical \"shore\" type hotel, and was very clean and comfortable for what we needed. No bells and whistles. AC worked good. Appliances in mini kitchen looked new. We had oceanfront room and that was the best part!! Loved waking up to the view of the ocean and sound of the waves. Easy to walk to beach. Has pool in parking lot but was not open yet too cold. Parking is real pain in the neck. Make sure you have your \"permit\" on the dash or you will get a warning on your car saying it would be towed. My pass blew off the dash when I shut my car door and I had a warning saying it would be towed. Front desk had my info on car and told me \" I had no pass\" before i even said anything which kind of annoyed me. They told me this when I went down to have my keys reprogrammed which magically both stopped working, yet they were quick to place blame on us stating we had it too close to a cell phone or credit card, even though I had them seperated the whole time. This place is in walking distance to Seacrets, so you will have loud rowdy drunks coming in at 2 am. That is one if main reasons we stay at this place, but we are not out of control. Something to consider if you are a light sleeper. Place not walking distance to boardwalk. Prices were hiked up due to car show weekend, but place probably wouldn't be too bad of a deal off season or during a normal summer week. Overall decent hotel, clean, and slightly updated. Best part was how close it was to the beach and the wonderful view. Typical \"shore\" hotel and we weren't disappointed as we knew not to go in with high expectations.

Had all working appliances (coffee maker-didn't try it, don't know how it was, microwave, oven, fridge). The refrigerator and freezer kept our items extremely cold. The AC in the room actually worked SO well that we had to turn it DOWN a few nights since we were so cold. The view from the 5th floor is absolutely gorgeous. Everyone here, from the hotel workers, ladies cleaning the rooms, receptionist, to other vacation goers, were EXTREMELY polite! I actually could not believe how friendly people were, it's great to know that there are a lot of wonderful people still left in the world!

The hotel is clearly older, but besides the bathroom which was a bit 80's our suite had been recently renovated (new carpet, furniture, appliances) and it looked like the inside of the hotel was freshly painted. The couch had a couple of stains on it - not sure why they got a light color upholstery for a hotel room! Cleaning service did a good job each day. In the suite, each room had a flat screen and an iHome docking station, and the main living area had a dvd player. Room had a free safe. Room was quiet at night. We did have to hang a towel over the window in the 2nd bedroom to darken it for our young kids - there were only miniblinds on the small window there and they let in too much light in the morning. The hotel is at 45th and the boardwalk starts around 25th or 30th...It will take you 20-30 minutes to walk down to the boardwalk (we just drove down). The upside of being away from the boardwalk is that the hotel is quiet and the beach isn't overcrowded. We loved that!!! There is also a parking lot right behind the hotel and you get a space with your room - we had no trouble parking at the hotel. We had to pay $400 for Saturday night, which felt overpriced to me but then again it was oceanfront in peak season. Paid $300/night the rest of the stay which felt fair.

At first, the hotel is hard to find, and parking isn't so great. The pool isn't very nice and is VERY small.

We would have loved to have stayed in Rehoboth but there are only a few oceanfront hotels and they were either booked or way more expensive. While looking for a hotel in OC, I read the reviews of the Atlantic Oceanfront Inn on TripAdvisor. I always read reviews before I book a hotel anywhere. After reading some glowing reviews and some not-so-great reviews, I went ahead and booked an oceanfront king room. Based on the reviews, I made sure to request a room on a high floor (above the 2nd floor) so that we could actually see the ocean from our balcony. We arrived on Thursday around 2:30pm and there was plenty of parking, but our room wasn't ready yet. Check-in time was at 3pm so we drove around a bit before going back. When we went back, the parking lot was almost full but we still found a spot. There were 2 girls at the front desk - the one who checked us in was very friendly and the other one seemed to be too involved in a personal phone call to even give us the time of day. I confirmed our request for a high floor and we were put on the 4th floor which was excellent! We got a parking permit and our keys and went to the room. It was nicer than I expected. My girlfriend (after seeing some news report about bed bugs in hotel rooms) immediately checked the bed to make sure we didn't have any extra visitors....all clear! The view was fantastic! We actually saw some dolphins playing...very cool! I wasn't sure if there would be shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom (which there was, pleasant surprise) so we brought our own just in case. Since we had an oceanfront king, our room was renovated which was a big plus! Great flat screen TV with lots of channels; comfortable, pillow-top mattress; decent bathroom (with shampoo/conditioner/lotion, but no hair dryer so bring your own); large balcony with comfortable chairs (did I mention the excellent view?); well-equiped kitchen (even though we didn't get as much use out of it as we planned); overall it was nice and clean for an old hotel. The housekeeping staff seemed nice although we never actually used their services while we were there. We just reused our towels and didn't really need anything from them so we kept the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door the whole time. Parking was sometimes a problem (no spaces later in the evening) but the maintenence man (I assume) showed us where we could park in the lot. Unfortunately, my car (at some point during the weekend) got scratched, probably by someone not watching where they were going when backing out of a space but it wasn't anything major. Also, there was a room of loud, obnoxious college boys having a big party in their room down the hall one night which woke us up around 3am. All it took was a quick call down to the front desk and within about 5 minutes, the party ended. Kudos to the staff for the quick response. Other than that incident, we slept really well the whole weekend. I brought my laptop even though the reviews had said the WI-FI wasn't great. I'm not sure where everyone else stayed but we had a great WI-FI connection throughout our stay. When I logged on to my computer, it asked for a user name and password to access the WI-FI which we received by calling down to the front desk. Perhaps we were lucky. As for the pool, we only used it once in the late evening. It was very sandy (some people just don't understand about washing off the sand BEFORE going in the pool) but we still went in. We were the ONLY people at the pool at the time which was really nice. It was nice that we were far enough from the boardwalk and the bigger hotels that the beach wasn't as crowded. PROS: Beachfront (not just oceanfront) hotel; great renovated rooms (oceanfront only); large, private balcony; FREE WI-FI; comfortable bed; decent pool; friendly staff; FREE coffee in the lobby; full kitchen; big flat-screen TV with DVD player CONS: No hairdryer in room (which we knew beforehand so brought our own); small parking lot and narrow spaces; water pressure in shower not great (but water was good and hot); knives in kitchen very dull (barely cut a lime for our Coronas); hallways were dark and outdated, could use some sprucing up All in all, we had a wonderful long weekend. We'd definitely go back or at least recommend to anyone looking for a decent oceanfront hotel that's less than $300/night.

Obviously the 'theme' of the getaway was relaxation, beach/pool and sun. For that, the Inn served its purpose. The location was worth the aggravations I encountered. Many hotels/inns/motels in OC state they are oceanfront, but when you drive by them, you notice that there are other buildings DIRECTLY in front of them. Luckily when the Inn stated oceanfront, it truly was! You walk out of the hotel, walk a few steps and you're on the beach. This end of the beach was much quieter because it wasn't directly on the boardwalk. They ran out of parking permits so I was unable to purchase one. Luckily I found a spot on the street, but parking is scarce and if you find one on the street, I suggest you do not move it until it is time for you to check out. The rooms were fairly decent. We had an oceanview room on the 2nd floor. The room wasn't updated but like I said, it was decent. Everything was pretty much in working order. The sofa was disgusting because there were stains all over it and it was just really worn down. I didn't even want to sit on it, let alone pull it out and sleep on it. So I didn't! I liked the fact that it had a kitchen. We didn't cook but used the refrigerator (full size) and the microwave (mini). The pool is small but it was never really crowded so it wasn't an issue. There was quite a bit of sand in the pool. I assume people came from the beach and didn't use the hose that was either right off the beach or the hose that was INSIDE the pool to rinse off. Also, the fliter wasn't running either day I was in it so that was a bit unsanitary I thought. Housekeeping wasn't really an issue. As others stated, the wireless doesn't really work. Luckily I actually took OFF on Friday and didn't try to be sneaky and say I was working from home because there is no way I would have been able to do so in that room! My advice is that if you are traveling with a family or want to actually relax, do not stay during the weekend. On Friday, the college kids took over and I swear it sounded like they were literally bowling in the room above us! I was hoping they were just loud while they were getting ready to go out but this lasted until around 1ish. Then we got some peace and quiet until around 4ish and then it started again. We called to the front desk initially but I doubt they even went up there. And if you stay that close to Seacrets (4 blocks if that) you have to expect that the college kids will be present in abundance. Would I stay at the Inn again? Probably not. I see what it has to offer so I'd probably try someplace else but in no means was it an awful place to stay.

It's VERY touristy so a mid week stay is really pleasant! The first room we got at the hotel was ok, note that this hotel claims that all rooms have Queen/Double beds. To me a double bed is a full size bed - and I KNOW those beds in our first room were full size (but I didn't argue the point) but that wasn't why we wanted to get a different room. When we saw the view from our side ocean room (and it was a ground floor room) we decided pretty quickly that we wanted to pay a little extra for an Ocean front view room and lucky for us they had one!! Once we saw the beach we knew we had to have that ocean view room - it's SO PRETTY! They were very nice and the room was ready for us very quickly! The new room was SO much nicer than the first! Plus it had a flat screen tv, a dvd player AND these were definitely queen beds! (My husband and I CAN'T share a full size and if we hadn't had any other options I would not have been happy but they worked with us which was great!) And the view was so beautiful! I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is that it's obvious that this hotel has been there for a long time and has taken a bit of a beating but it was clean, service was great and I really liked the location! Were there stains on the couch? Yes. Was there some damage to the table in the room? Yes. But the room was clean, the kitchenette was perfect and kept down the cost of food, the balcony had two comfortable outdoor lounge chairs, the pool was small but so nice for a quick dip and the view was awesome. As for the location - I loved that it wasn't on the boardwalk (which is tourist central) and the beach wasn't crowded, the parking is tight but we always found a space. We were really pleased over all! I can see where this place may not be so great on the weekends (Sat night especially) considering all the frat boys we saw checking in as we were checking out but we really did enjoy it and look forward to going back again! Oh, two quick things though -first, they have one floor that is smoking (the third) and we were on the second, one afternoon our bathroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke (the only thing I can think of is that someone above us was smoking in the bathroom above us and I am SUPER sensitive to cigarette smoke) so for a little bit we closed the bathroom door and left the fan on and by the time we got back from the beach it no longer smelled at all.

We had a two room suite on the 2nd floor facing north. Had requested that we be on the 5th floor facing south, this was totally ignored. At check in front desk clerk seems bothered by any requests or suggestions. When we entered the parking lot by the pool we noticed that is was halfway drained and the filters had not been running because it was dirty. Figured they were getting ready to close it up for the winter. There was another couple checking in before us and they asked what amenities the hotel offered and the clerk had the nerve to point to and suggest the pool. Weird. The room itself had been remolded with new carpet, new dressers, countertops, and appliances. No dishwasher in the little kitchen, and housekeepping does not do dishes, which led us to wonder how they were santized between guests. Washed all dishes in scalding hot water before we used them. The beds were also new and comfy with white crisp linens. Towels we big and fluffy and bathroon was clean upon arrival. After that housekeeping never cleaned the tub ( mat never taken off bottom and we could see our own hairs) we had 3 tissues in a box under the sink, after using these and throwing the box away we never received another box of tissues the entire stay(4 days). Seperate air conditioning units in the bedroom and the living area, but I ran both of them at full blast for hours and could not get the rooms to cool any lower than 78 degrees. The AC unit in the living area was situated so that if you sat on the balcony with it running you could not hear the ocean or anything else. The unit in the bedroom was so loud that it atcually startled you awake when the fan would kick on. The little bedroom was tiny and had only a bed and dresser, no TV, no clock or radio. The living area had a sofa, table and four chairs, another bed, nightstand, dresser, flat scrren TV and DVD player,clock radio and an old fashioned Ma Bell princess phone when picked up was nothing but static. There were no instuctions or guides in the room. No restaurant or attraction guides, nothing explaining the layout of the hotel or where anything was located. Had to figure all this out for yourself. Not even anything printed on the phone about how to dail the front desk, or get an outside line. No TV channel list and nothing about what to do in the event of a fire. They advertise free WIFI throughout the hotel, they only way I could find to connect was sit on the floor by the entrance to our room. If I moved even over to the bed 4 feet away it would disconnect. Ice machine was outside with one soda machine which wanted $1.75 for a 20oz soda. There were two luggage carts for the entire hotel and the only entrance was up a ramp at a 45 degree angle. Difficult to say the least for loading and unloading luggage. The best thing of all was the two holes in the living area wall in the newly renovated room.

We stayed at the Atlantic Oceanfront Inn and it was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had in my life. First off, the staff was incredibly rude and unprofessional.. I cannot even stress that enough. The hotel was absolutely filthy... some lightbulbs worked, some didn't, one cheap plastic chair on the balcony, the door handle was broken and had to be opened only a certain way, the bathrooms disgusting, beds hard as a rock, etc etc. When first entering the hotel we noticed that the toilet had been stomped up. With absolute disgust, we immediately called the front desk to ask to have that fixed. We waited and waited for someone until we finally had to call again in which they explained that they had already come to our room and no one answered, which was a complete lie. They continued to argue with us saying that we had to go down to THEM and they would give us a plunger!! I was absolutely appalled and complained that I would absolutely not plunge a toilet that we found like that when we entered our room. They continued to argue saying that the maintainence worker was off and no one was there to do it so we had to and \"if [we] didn't like it [we] can complain to the manager in the morning\". After a couple minutes she finally said ok she'll have someone come up. When they knocked on the door, they handed us the plunger and walked away. Absolutely rude and disgusting if you ask me. So after this occurrence and all of us frustrated as it is, we noticed that the bathroom had absolutely no towel, floor mats, wash clothes, etc. What hotel does that? Again, we called the front desk to ask if they could bring us towels. They replied that if we wanted towels WE had to go get them ourselves downstairs. Are you kidding? Again implying that \"if [we] didn't like it [we] can complain to the manager in the morning\". When the towels were retrieved from the front desk they had only given us 2 so we explained we would be needing more and they refused to give us any more than 2 towels. Not to mention, the staff was just sitting there playing Solitaire on the computer. We were absolutely beyond furious at this point! Later on, we realized we needed more pillows. Again, called the front desk to ask if we could get more pillows. They flat out said that we could absolutely not get any more pillows. Not to mention, we were again told \"if [we] didn't like it [we] can complain to the manager in the morning\". We were stuck using the pillows from the couches! The flat pillows and the rock hard beds with one itchy thin comforter caused the most horrible nights sleep, as you can imagine. I couldn't stress to you more what a horrible hotel this is, regardless of the decent prices and ok view. Having to deal with the incredibly rude staff and the dirty rooms is definitely not worth it. Please, please, please do not waste your time or money.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201chorrible! never again!!\u201d", "Author": "vacationlover45", "ReviewID": "UR18731976", "Content": "this hotel was beyong horrible! me my husband and my two children one 15 and one 12 walked in and it was a mess. the toilet was broken not even attatched to the ground. there was no toilet paper only two towels. the couch smelled like throw up. the chair by the table was broken and the carpet tacks were sticking out of the ground. there was a pretty nice view but that was about it, the beds were not confortable and the chairs on the balcany were plastic chairs. the staff were very rude and they didnt vaccume or clean our room. they didnt take all the dirty towels off the floor in the bathroom and they were just beyond rude. we will NEVER stay there again and i reccomend that no one stays in this hotel.", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Atlantic Oceanfront Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d93774-Reviews-Atlantic_Oceanfront_Inn-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$115 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4501 Atlantic Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "93774", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2c/ff/d4/atlantic-oceanfront-inn.jpg"}}

I arrived at the airport at midnight. There is a shuttle to the airport that runs every 20 minutes. This is very convenient, but it will take you nearly 20 minutes to walk through the airport tunnels to the shuttle stop. We were picked up in the most run-down shuttle of all the busses I saw from other hotels, but the driver was polite. The shuttle stops at the Marriott Suites first before going to the Marriott, so figure on a 15-minute drive. The hotel was under construction when I was there and the entry was a bit of a mess. Check-in at the temporary reception desk on the third floor was prompt. The exterior of the hotel looks like a run-down motel with a running balcony that allows anyone to walk along right outside your window. The sidewalk was crumbling in places. Several wings were closed down for renovation. Once in the room, thought, it was clear that they are serious about their renovation. The rooms had new or updated furniture and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was small and cramped but with all new appointments and an excellent shower. The rooms have a flat screen TV with Pay per view and sleek new telephones. The Wi-fi worked well. It made me agree to a charge, but the charge didn\u2019t show up on my bill. The bar stayed open until midnight but I didn\u2019t use it. There is both an outdoor and indoor pools and fitness center, but I did not use these. If you are going to a meeting with the NBOME or the Lutheran Center, this is the most convenient location but it is still a 10 minute walk through winding cooridors (I'm glad I had a map). There are nice restaurants within a 10-minute taxi ride.

The reception is on the 3rd floor so you have to take an elevator up to check in. Then to get to my room I had to walk for 5 minutes, pulling my luggage and computer through the middle of the dining room and around a corner and then down a hall and back down on an elevator and all the way to the end of another hall on a ground floor room. Very inconvenient. I got lost trying to find the elevator as no one told me that I had to walk thru the middle of the dining room. So I had to drag my bags back to reception to ask for directions again. And still no one offered to help me with my stuff. I eventually did get to my room. I apparently was in one of the renovated rooms and the room itself was OK but still not quite working (issues with TV, etc.). The main problem, however, is that it seemed deserted in this section and dark and dingy. And looking out into a dark courtyard at ground level with no one else around just didn't feel safe. Felt like I was staying in a strip motel where you would pay $59. Room service man was very nice but the food was not great, salmon was fried vs grilled and just not what I expected for the price.

The facility is worn and although they are renovating, the feel of the hotel is old and run down. I was \"fortunate\" enough to be stuck out in the \"B\" building which meant to get to your room you have to walk through the indoor pool area that was reminiscent of a steam bath. By the time we made it to the doors to re-enter the hotel and head to our room we were covered in sweat and condensation. There is no way around going through the swimming area, which we found ridiculous. It may be fine in the winter, but not in 110 degree weather. The hotel boasts \"convenient accessability\" to downtown via a train stop just behind the hotel. This is false. If you are looking for a hotel with easy access to downtown Chicago, this is not the hotel. First of all, to get to the entrance to the train you have to walk to the back of the building which is not lighted and is a haven for homeless people (we encountered one on the way back our first night urinating in the elevator). There are no doors in the back of the hotel to avoid walking around the entire building outside (not fun in 110 degree weather). . Additionally, they have locked the gate between the parking lot of the hotel and the train area and provide a special code to access. Each night as we tried to maneuver our way back to the hotel, the code wouldn't work and the gate would stick. There are security guards hanging out by the front door of the hotel, but we never found one working the area behind the hotel near the train access. If you want to go downtown and don't want to take a train, its an $80 cab fare round trip (plus tip). Our room was dirty and there was hair in the bathtub and in the floor of the bathroom. The sheets smelled musty and overall the room felt and appeared dirty. Also, if you are on a business trip and need access to a computer with printing capabilities, you must scan a credit card that holds your account for $80 for 48 hours. There is no way around this so if you need a 5 minute computer to print one document as I did, then you have to give up $80 of credit on your card until they remove the charges. This is ridiculous as most hotels have a system where access to printers is free, and if there is a charge it ranges from $7- $12 for 15 minute increments and does not hold your card with ridiculous fees. All in all this is not a good representation of the Marriott brand. I would not recommend this facility for any reason.

I was here for a convention (not business) being held at the hotel. The convention was wonderful, no complaints about food, service or anything there. The rest of the hotel is going through much needed renovations. I asked for a room in the garden wing walking out to the pool. The first one they gave me was overlooking the 2nd pool which was locked. Most of the rooms in this courtyard area were being renovated so a lot of the doors into the hotel corridores were locked. I went to the front desk the next morning and they were very nice and moved me into another room by the indoor/outdoor pool. They also said that a friend coming in later that day would have the room next to me. When she checked in they originally assigned her a room far away from mine. When I asked why they were able to find one down the hall. I think the problem was one room next to me had been renovated and seemed to be a model for the others -empty while I was there with the light on all the time. There were lights left on in the majority of the rooms being renovated also. I look for hotels that are on the \"green\" side so the waste of energy bothered me. Also there were no recycling containers anywhere in the hotel. Cans were thrown away with garbage. Hopefully this will be fixed when the hotel is finished. One other weird note, the housekeeper kept taking the soap I had partially used. I put one bar back in the box so she would leave it and she took that and another unopened one! The rooms are definately dated and need to be upgraded but the room I saw that seemed to be finished looked very nice. The carpet is worn and dirty. I needed a refrigerator for my medicine I had to call 2x for it in the 2nd room. I got one right away in the 1st room. I should have asked for it to be transferred because the one I got never went below 50 degrees. I carry a thermometer because my medicine cannot be frozen. I never asked for another one but I did hear that someone elses refrigerator quit working after a night. I hope these are being replaced also. I needed freezer packs to be frozen for the way home and the front desk had me take them into the restaurant. The person there was very nice but when I went to pick them up the restaurant was closed and it took a long time for the front desk to get them.

Oddly, the pool area is one of the few things to recommend about this hotel -- it has quite a nice set up, though nobody seemed to be using it when I was there. The restaurant and bar are decent enough, but overpriced. Speaking of overpriced: the parking is absurd, at $24 per day ($30 for valet), and wireless Internet access is equally as absurd, at $12.95 per day. If you have a car, there are some decent restaurants a few miles away. If you don't, you're stuck with the hotel restaurant, a pizza place (which is a must if you have never been to Chicago), or a couple of fast food joints. There is nothing else of any interest nearby. It is about a 45 minute ride on the \"L\" train to downtown. Overall, if you have to stay in Chicago for a couple of days and don't need or want to go downtown, the Marriott isn't a terrible option if you can get a good rate.

We have stayed here in the past and found it nice enought and convienent since it is right on the edge of Chicago and less than a block away from an El station making it easily accessible to downtown Chicago without having to drive and park in downtown Chicago. The hotel room was ok and we had a king room (Rm 303). This room faces the interstate, and the El train tracks, and O'Hare airport so there is a lot of traffic noise, train noise, and take off and landing noise. We live in the Minneapolis area so were not overly worried but it was noisy. It is noisier still in the hallway though. The second night of our stay a wedding party had a room down the hall and we had to call security three different times to come and quiet the group. Made it fairly miserable for settling down that night but we blamed ourselves as a \"you get what you pay for\" deal. There is a large window overlooking a deck but you cannot open the door (probably to keep down the noise) too. It was a bit strange since usually patio type windows open. The pool here is one of their more interesting features since it is an indoor/outdoor pool and you can swim underneath a barrier to move between pools. Our eight year old loved it but the pool is getting more worn out and needs maintenence that the hotel doesn't seem to care about. In one place in the indoor part it looks like mold is growing on the side of the pool. The pool is warmer than most swimming pools on the plus side and is 12 feet deep, and long enough to do laps both inside and outside. We probably would stay here again but will ask for a room not facing the interstate or higher up so the traffic noise and El noise isn't as noticeable.

My first stay was in the \"motel\" section. This property has a 12-story main tower and connected to it two square-shaped \"motel\" that is 3-stories high. The \"motel\" section has open balconies with chairs where you could sit facing central courtyards. One courtyard contains the outside part of the indoor/outdoor pool. The other courtyard has a seasonal outdoor pool which was covered during my stay. My second stay was on the 12-floor of the main tower. From the balcony window facing the airport I could see planes coming in on their approach and almost see them land. In the distance I would see planes take off. Unfortunately the balcony door did not open, probably due to liability concerns. Perhaps in years past, before people became sue-happy, guests could step outside and enjoy the breeze. Now the balcony looks neglected, worn, and dirty. The noise from the planes is noticeable in the room and occurred on a regular basis during the day (just about every 5 minutes). Even though I was on the top floor, I could also hear the traffic from the nearby freeway. I'm not a light sleeper so none of the noise really bothered me. The rooms in the tower and the \"motel\" were very similar. Neither roomy nor small. For some reason the ceiling in the bathroom was lower than in the room and the bathroom was definitely tight. You kind of have to step out of the way to open and close the bathroom door. I felt a little claustrophobic. On my second stay, 2 of the lights would not work. It turns out both were not plugged in; something the housekeeping staff should have checked. Otherwise everything worked as expected. I will agree with previous reviewers that this hotel is a bit dated. I can see that areas of renovation and modernization have taken place over the years but clearly there's only so much that can be done to an older property. The public areas, such as the lobby, meeting rooms, and restaurants look nice but the remaining areas, corridors, and rooms are dated and worn. I did not use the pool but it looked nice and was used by many guests. I did use the gym which was located at the very end of the \"motel\" section away from the tower. The gym had a nice selection of aerobic machines and some weight machines as well as some dumbells. Every one of the staff I encountered was professional, friendly, and helpful. The airport shuttle service during my first stay was frequent and prompt. The shuttle does stop at the Marriott Suites first from the airport and then makes a stop there on the way to the airport. If you have a choice between staying here or at the Marriott Suites, I would recommend the latter. My second stay, I self-parked which cost $20 with unlimited in-and-out privileges. I would probably choose another place to stay if I was in the area in the future.

The one thing this hotel has going for it, is location. The El train - into downtown is within short walking distance, the airport is quickly accessed by shuttle, the convention ctr is about 2 miles away and freeway access, is just around the corner. On the downside, this hotel appears to have been built in the 60's. We were in a room located on the west wing (3 floors only) as opposed to the main tower. It reminded me of staying in a motel, only it was much larger. With elevators by the main lobby, it was quite a walk to our room, something reminiscent of large Las Vegas hotels. In addition, while we entered the room from an inside hallway, the room has an additional door that led to a shared walkway on the outside. If you did not draw the heavy drapes, the inside could be seen even with the sheer drapes closed. Because of this, most of the time it was kept closed, making it darker in the room. While the furnishings in the room were outdated and worn, the bed was newer and very comfortable. I must admit, the very old crystal lamps gave me a chuckle. I haven't seen those, since I was a kid in the 70's. Because the bed was quite high, it was difficult seeing the tv, which was placed so low in the armoire. The bathroom was tiny, but clean. The toiletries were quite nice - Bath and Bodyworks Aromatherapy. Staff was always courteous and friendly. The sports lounge had good food and the small gift shop was convenient. The internet is not free as they say on their website. And parking was outrageous at $20 considering the huge uncovered lot in the front. All in all, at the conference rate, it was ok.

I wanted access to downtown Chicago's shopping, dining, and culture. The hotel is only a 5-minute walk from the Cumberland L station. That let me go downtown without worrying about auto traffic and parking. However, the Blue Line was undergoing renovation, and the trip seemed closer to an hour than the usual 45 minutes. Also, I wanted access to visit family outside the city. The hotel is barely a block or two from the Cumberland I-90 exit. In addition, I was flying out of O'Hare. I don't think it took me more than 10 minutes to drive from the hotel to the Hertz car return. So the hotel met my key expectation: convenient location. My Hertz reservation led me to a special deal for that weekend. I stayed three nights at a $109 base rate, but the special deal meant that I only had to pay for the first two nights. I'm glad I brought the Internet printout explaining the special deal. At both check-in and check-out, the clerks were unfamiliar with it. However, both times they took my printout to the manager. After a few minutes, they came back and honored the special deal. I did have to pay for wired Internet ($12.95/night) and self-parking ($16.75/night). My room was in the tower, which was close to the lobby. However, parts of the hotel are some distance away. The walk to the fitness center was roughly 5 minutes. On the way there, I noticed two men starting their workout by running through the hallway to the fitness center. That made sense since the distance was so great. The fitness center itself was uncrowded during my visits. An elliptical-type cardiovascular machine worked well and had a built-in tv; I had to bring my own headphones to listen to the sound. The center also has weight machines, and the hotel has indoor and outdoor pools. The room itself was generally typical of other Marriotts where I've stayed in size, decor, and general condition. In other words, it was adequate, with no significant problems but no especially exciting features. The king bed did seem to reflect the recent trend toward a soft, complicated set of bedding with lots of pillows.

I encountered uniformly friendly and helpful staff--including the bellman at the front door, the maid, and the parking lot attendant. They seemed genuinely eager to help.

The room as well as the hotel in general are acceptable, but not up to the standards of the typical Marriott. The facilities seem to be rather old, and in need of more than a superficial redecorating. My room was on the ground floor in a wing overlooking the pool. I was nervous about noise, but this was not a problem once evening came. The bed was very comfortable with bountiful pillows and comforters. The furniture and carpeting looked to be well worn but clean. The only cleaning flaw I could see were \"dust bunnies\" in the corners of the bathroom floor (under the counter). I had difficulty adjusting the thermostat in the room -- the only choices seemed to be to blast the air conditioning to arctic level or endure dampness/humidity that left the mirror fogged (this was long before I took a shower, I should note!). Internet access is available for a fee. I didn't eat any meals at the hotel so I can't speak to their food offerings. I got a snack at the gift shop which has plenty of drinks and healthy snacks available. My colleague and I found the front desk staff to be somewhat less than helpful when we were seeking restaurant recommendations. The employee handed us a mimeographed sheets with restaurant options, but really couldn't tell us what was near or far, although she told us none were in walking distance. Airport-Hotel shuttle: We waited over half an hour at the airport bus area -- the shuttle seems to service a number of hotels so it can be slow at peak times. The CTA Blue Line is right next to the hotel premises. It was very easy to get downtown.

We were able to get the LAST room at the Marriott O'hare. None were available at ANY of the other hotels he tried and he tried every online travel website as well as major hotel chain. O'hare airport is very confusing to find bus/shuttle center. Once you do finally find it, shuttle comes to door number 2. Shuttle takes about 15 minutes and stops at other Marriott properties first. Since we were checking in close to midnight, we were able to immediately and the staff was very helpful and kind. We had no luggage as it had gone on an earlier flight so they gave us some toiletries and robes which I found very nice! We requested room service breakfast during a 15 minute time spread and a wake up call. We discovered the next morning that our room clock was set to an incorrect time, but the wake up call saved us and arrived on time. Breakfast was nicely presented but arrived right on the dot of the final moment of the 15 min. time block. A bit pricey but we were tired and it was better than eating in the airport. Shuttle runs every 20 minutes on the hour and they are prompt. No problems to mention, room was overlooking the pool, nice and quiet, clean, the beds were comfortable, sheets and towels nice and soft.

The hallways felt dim and underlit, and not in a fashionable way. My room was an unreasonably long walk from the lobby, as you have to walk throught the pool atrium (!). Most people would find it to be an approximately 10 minute walk. The staff was surpisingly pleasant and helpful even by Marriott standards. The food in the restaurant was decent but typically pricey. The airport shuttle leaves every 15 minutes and was on-time. The room internet access was $12/day and wired only (not wireless), so there's no surfing from bed .

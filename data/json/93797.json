The room was large, and given a top floor stay, had a spectacular view of the ocean. The structure is solid, but the overall hotel appears to be falling short of repair. The room was clean, but you can detect it is falling apart. For the price and location, if you want to stay in Ocean City, but not anywhere near the hubbub, the Fenwick Inn is a great choice.

Aug. 26 thru 29. With the Fling you get the 3 weeknights, $12 daily breakfast coupon, and a $40 voucher for dinner of your choice at 10 different (pre-chosen) restaurants. Now the Review The room was very nice, very clean and comfy. We got the king bed room, huge comfy bed (but take your own pillow) a sofa and a desk with mini fridge and microwave. Room faced Bayside, no view but we didnt look out the window much. Nice stong shower, plenty of towels. Breakfast was limited choices but ok for a quickie breakfast. With the copon you'll kick in $8 to $10 for two for breakfast and that includes tip. We got to the beach early every day thanks to just taking the elevator upstairs to eat. The upstairs lounge was was nice we had good happy hour prices and a great bartender (Alex) The pool is nice water was ok, overclorinated but most indoor pools are. Its open until 10pm which was nice after hitting some happy hours and coming back for a late swim. For the dinner voucher we chose one of the buffet places for our dinner but thats a different review. The voucher cut our dinner cost by 2/3s with tip so it was a real value. All in all if you can book the Fenwick Fling you cant go wrong. The hotel is older, but nice and clean, and friendly people, and service. We paid $250 for what is esentially still prime time in OCMD and we got breakfast daily and dinner one night. Also included when you book at the Fenwick Inn site you get to choose 5 or 6 coupons for places like the Green Turtle, Smitty's, and many more vouchers. We didnt even use all of our vouchers.

Friday the 15th was set-up day. After a tiring friday beach traffic drive and exhibit set-up, my wife and I set off to the Fenwick Inn to check in. I had made reservations in February and was expecting to get the rate negotiated between the Fenwick Inn and my hotel room broker (a large national service which supplies discount lodging sevices across the US and also to various Federal, State, and Local government agencies). The rate I was expecting to pay is approximately one half the normal in-season room rate. This rate is secured under contract between the hotel and my lodging service. The lodging service does not show any blackout dates or caveats. When I arrived at the hotel, the lobby was jammed with noisy softball tournament participants and their parents/chaperones. The lobby desk staff were working as fast as they could and included the Manager on Duty - Ch___les. It was he whom I dealt with at check in time. When I presented him with my reservation confirmation and the account card the lodging service provides to be presented upon check in and required by participating hotels, he indicated that he would not be able to honor my rate under the contract between the Fenwick Inn and the lodging service. I was taken aback. I was over 100 miles from home and there were no other hotels which participated in this lodging service. I mentioned my reservations made in February and confirmed in May. The Manager on Duty said he was under instructions from the hotel manager to not honor the contracted rate due to some disagreement with the lodging service. I called the lodging service 1-800 number to speak to a representative. They indicated that the facility was under contract and that they did not show any blackout dates. They confirmed what my rate was supposed to be and offered to call the hotel to try to get us a room for that evening at the contracted rate. They promised to call back. Fifteen minutes later, they called back. Long and Short: The hotel manager on duty (whom I had already received a 'no' from) also told the lodging service that the hotel would not honor their contracted rate. I asked for a supervisor and got one. I explained the situation to her and she also called the hotel. The manager on duty apparently called the general manager at home during this time. After the lodging service supervisor spoke with the manager on duty, I received a call back from her. Long and Short: No Dice..... The lodging service supervisor was unable to help me out and said that their contract administration dept would take up the matter on the following Monday. Meanwhile, my wife and I are S-O-L. The closest participating hotel was 25 miles away. We were stuck in a resort town on a friday night with no reservations and hotels which were charging premium rates because they were more than 80% full.... The Fenwick Inn manager on duty was discussing his discomfort with others behind the counter loudly enough to hear and remarked his displeasure with having to be the 'bad guy'. My wife and I were thoroughly disgusted at this point with the Fenwick Inn and their failure to honor their committments. As we were departing their lobby, the manager made a weak, lame, half-hearted apology as were were at the door from behine the counter. At that point, my wife suggested if the Fenwick Inn truly had a problem with the lodging service and their contract/billing/payments, that the obvious solution was to take the matter up with the company and not to ding the customer.

Heard for years, when I was a kid, how posh the Fenwick was-that was in the good ole' days-no longer even close to posh! My husband and I have not had a vacation in 4 years-due to a sick child and a sick father. We so needed a break-both of us work 2 jobs. The room was small, not as clean as I would have liked-no hair dryer-no fan in the bathroom. Pillows were so uncomfortable-no support at all...mushy and squishy. Our first night I was awokened by other guests banging on the doors and yelling down the hallway. The second night(about 1230am)-customers from the bar(upstairs in Fenwick) were in parking lot-drinking out of plastic cups-arguing...screaming....pushing each other...5 floors below us! We could hear everything clearly.The night time front desk clerk attempted to get the crowd of 10/12 to leave with no luck. Hotel has no security at all-one girl-who we were told did not want to call the police and get the bar patrons in trouble. The bar patrons were beyond drunk and one car drove through the red light fast when leaving the lot! The other car, van, kept having the alarm go off...numerous times at 1am in the morning! About 8 people who were drunk after making noise and disturbing the peace finally left-driving through the parking lot-obviously drunk. I called down to the front desk in the middle of this disturbance and asked the front desk lady, how long she was going to let this continue? She was no help at all! I told the front desk crew at check out in the morning-they could have cared less. The young man who worked the front desk the first day of our check in-seemed to be the only employee who actually cared about us and the service! Our first night-we decided to visit the bar upstairs. We were looking forward to the \"happy hour\" the website offered so wonderfully. The bartender upon arrival was \"weeded\" with 5 customers sitting at the bar. We waited a very long time when waiting to be served. We then asked for a menu-which we never got from him-but he seemed to get others around us a menu. The relief bartender came in-apparently late to his shift and seemed to care less about service than the first bartender. We asked for a menu and if they had any food specials....we were told \"shrimp\"...with a gruff and giggle. What kind of shrimp? No explantation...no nothing! The couple behind us also got sick of waiting for service and left. My husband and I felt slightly relieved that it was not us personally that were being ignored! We never got asked if we wanted to order food...so we quickly finished our drink...and left! We stopped at the front desk and told the very nice young man who was working earlier our issue-he did not seem shocked at our lousy service. We then went and ate across the street at LEOS! COMPLETELY not even worth the 98 buck special we were given. TOTally disappointed in the lack of cleanliness....professionalism etc. The icing on the cake was that the maid ran over my IPOD charger with the vacumn...ruining it-while were out for the day.

My husband, one-year-old son, and I were in town for a family reunion, so we saw quite a few rooms on the fifth and sixth floors. The lobby and elevators look like they may have been updated within the past few years, and the bathrooms on the fifth floor were fairly nice with granite countertops and new fixtures, but the bedding, walls, ceilings, and hallways probably look the same way they did forty or fifty years ago when this place opened. Our room was a king room on the sixth floor. Pros? It was spacious, the air conditioning unit worked, there was hot water and decent water pressure, and there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room. The hotel was just a short, one block walk to the beach. Cons? The hallways were incredibly dark and dingy -- like a bad horror movie with flickering fluorescent lights, popcorn ceilings, exposed water sprinkler pipes, and matted, old carpet. The rooms themselves were quite dated with broken furniture, ripped wallpaper, stains on the walls, water damage on the ceiling, and faded, dingy bedding. My first impression upon entering the room was...\"Yuck.\" It wasn't exactly cheap, either, considering that it was off-season and that the hotel wasn't the best: $153 per night. It was not worth that much. Other things of note: To their credit, the front desk was fast with check-in and check-out. We ate at the hotel restaurant on the 8th floor, and it was mediocre. The food was good but not memorable, and it was definitely overpriced. The bar staff was friendly, and the drinks were cold -- no complaints there. They have an indoor pool, but we did not use it.

At check in, the woman at the front desk was very friendly (forget her name now though). She said that she had a room available but it was on the 7th floor, just below the restaurant and asked us if that would be alright. (I suppose this would be bothersome to families with children). No problem for us though, as we just needed a place to sleep & shower. As I said, we were only in the room to sleep, but it was a nice, clean room. Some of these reviews are very negative when they really shouldn't be! Our bed was clean, our sheets/pillowcases/floor/bathroom/sink/tub everything was clean. I also liked that they had enough parking for everyone. There is parking in both the front and the back. We went up to the restaurant for some late night drinks. There were only a few other people in there, but it was fine and the drinks were reasonably priced. I have eaten dinner there previously, but they have since changed the name/owner? It was delicious when we ate there the first time, and I'm sure it still is. It is only a block+ from the beach, and you do have to cross Coastal Highway to get to it.

Boardwalk fries, crab cakes, mini-golf, the beach, and the Fenwick Inn! My family loves this place. I have been here at least 100 times. It has been awesome every time. The staff is super friendly, They are very helpful when it comes to anything. They really do care that you have a great stay. Jordon's Rooftop has a great view and delicious food. It is open to the public so if you have your own place down here, you should still check it out! The bar is fully stocked with all the best drinks. There is a pool table and other games as well. Check it out on a weekend night. You can find some great music and dancing.The pool is super comfortable. It has a huge hot tub with jets. The heated pool even has jets! It also has an outdoor seating area to relax in the sun. The rooms are perfect. The beds and pillows are super comfortable. Huge TVs in each room, fridge, and a nice view on either side of the building. IF YOU DONT READ ANY OF THE ABOVE AT LEAST READ THIS...........you will not find a better hotel in Ocean City for the prices the Fenwick Inn is offering. Do yourself a favor, take a look at some of the rates other places charge just to stay there. WOW! How can you be expected to rent a jet ski or go out to eat! Craziness. The Fenwick Inn understands that people want to come and enjoy the beach, the food, the boardwalk, everything. They want people to have fun here and come back soon. That is why my family does. We love it here! Oh yeah to to top it all off, they are dog friendly during the off season! (I wish it was all season) You can bring the pooches to enjoy the beach and boardwalk during your stay.

We love Ocean City in the offseason since it is so quiet. We were just looking for a weekend to getaway. The Front Desk was very friendly and courteous upon check-in. We were able to check in a few hours before the official check-in time of 4pm which was wonderful so we could go shopping before dinner. We opted for a suite since it was offseason and the price difference wasn't that much. We were so glad we did. We had a dining area with a microwave and frig. Those really came in handy since my husband could not finish his dinner one evening so he was able to put it in the frig and then reheat it for lunch the next day. The suite also had 2 bathrooms. The master bathroom had a jacuzzi tub in it which was great so my husband and I could have some privacy. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding looked and felt brand new. The suite also had a living room that was separate from the bedroom. Both rooms had a flat screen TV with HD channels which my husband loved.

After check in we were given a room on the 6th floor. Overall we were very happy with it.

We were upset about this because our stay was for 2 days, our full day promising rain. The hotel gave us free passes to the Jolly Roger Water Park and it was probably the most fun we had all weekend. I can't say I wasn't still disappointed about the closed pool but the passes were a great value. They supposedly have free internet but it did not work in our corner room. We used it in the lobby no problem. We had breakfast one morning at the hotel restaurant and found it to be satisfactory. It was inexpensive and the food was decent.

The extremely rude front desk people wouldn't let anyone check in until 4pm. (we arrived at 3:15pm) So we decided to go lay by the indoor pool. Come to find out it's closed because someone died in it days prior. They promised it would be opened the following day. (we wouldn't of swam in it anyways..) It stayed closed the entire week. But they did give us comp passes to the Jolly Rogers water park. So we decided to wait in the rooftop bar/restaurant until 4. Guess everyone else had the same idea because the place was packed with people waiting to check in. I think this was their tactic to get people to buy food & drinks. The restaurant seemed extremely dirty and the food others were eating didn't look very good. At 4pm, we went to check in and found the lobby was packed and the line was out the door.

We had people traveling from all over the east coast and as far away as Oregon. The hotel does not allow any early check-ins, nor will they atleast register guests prior to 4pm. Despite being on the road for 11 hours, we arrived at 3pm and couldn't even use accommodations prior to 4pm. (I have worked at hotels in Myrtle Beach, also a beach resort town. Should a room be ready prior to check-in we always proceeded with checking-in the guest. If not ready, we atleast registered the guest to avoid waiting in the long check-in lines later on. There were also facilities to change for pool/beach use.) I did not feel very welcomed by the staff there. In addition, the pool was closed and no alternatives were given. We were told they were cleaning the pool and it should be open later when in reality someone died the day before and the pool would be closed indefinitely. We found out later that water park passes were being given to guests, but no announcement was made. By the time we found out, we were checking out Sunday morning. (I do not mean to sound indifferent to someone's death. And I realize the beach is right there. We did have many elderly people who cannot sit in the sun and stay on the beach.) Besides bringing a large group there, we brough the hotel a lot of money between room rates, facility/banquet room, food and restaurant, I believe we were not treated as a top notch hotel should treat a guest. Our room was great and the food was great. But treatment was definitely below standards. Another inconvenience, the hotel did not include banquet and food for the reunion into the room rate, as many do for groups.

I've been staying at condos and hotels in OC every summer, all of my life. I found this one with an ad in the Washington Post. The room rates were quite cheap for the week I stayed. I looked on tripadvisor and found that the reviews were split 50/50. Check-in is at 3, plenty of parking in the front and rear off of the Coastal Highway. The hotel is about 10 blocks south of the Fenwick, Deleware border. I was pleased with the room because on the 6,7,8th floors you can get a room with an ocean view (not ocean front). The room was decent (not great, looked well used and as old as the hotel itself). And of course, there's no water pressure but atleast there was hot water. The best part of the room was the very comfy bed. The worst part was the tv with no remote. Rooms come with a microwave, and mini-fridge. Fenwich offers a free wi-fi network, but most rooms are separated by a concrete wall. You can always go sit in the lobby or rec room to get a good signal. There are so many choices for restaurants in Ocean City, and you just have enough choices within 4 blocks from the hotel. Room service is efficient and thorough. There's an indoor pool that seems to be quite popular on rainy days with the younger crowd. On the 8th floor, Jordan's Restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I ate breakfast at Jordans every day, it was rather cheap and easy. However, while the bar boasts that it has cheaper drinks, the dinner menu is a bit pricy. I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone that will travel to OC. Whether you're new to the city, or you've been coming to it for years, it's as good a beach hotel you'll get.

Let me add that we were also travelling with two teenagers and two children under 10 yrs. old. We stayed at the Fenwick Inn for three nights this past August. We arrived at 12:00 PM and where told that they HAD NO ROOMS READY AND THAT WE COULD NOT CHECK IN BEFORE 4:00 PM. This was fine since we wanted to get some beach time in. I came back at 4:00 as I really wanted to unload the truck and get settled. Because they don't let anyone in before 4:00, there is a mad rush to get checked in. Be prepared to wait 40 minutes. Also a local police officer was leaving the hotel with a incident report while I was waiting to check in. Not the most encouraging beginning to a family vacation. Finally, I got our rooms and gathered the family who were waiting outside (no place to stand inside). We went up to the rooms and saw at least 5 trays of discarded room service food trays outside the rooms left over from breakfast. Since it was now closer to 5:00 PM, these should have been cleaned up already. The two rooms were OK. Each had a mini fridge and microwave. Both reeked of cigarettes even though they were supposedly \"non-smoking\" rooms. Pealing paint on ceiling as a result of water damage and carpet stains, but overall clean. I wouldn't want to spend any time in the room other to sleep and shower, but that was the expectation from the start. Bathroom was fine and clean. Not a lot of water pressure from shower but was warm. Also bring your own shampoo and soap. They do offer, but must be used sparingly. I wouldn't use the pool. When we walked by, there where probably 30 unsupervised kids in and out of the pool and hot tub likely creating swim conditions that would be less than favorable to get in concidering no one seemed to monitor pool. There was also a small arcade that my son enjoyed while waiting to check in. Hotel is close to the beach (one block), but you do have to cross Coastal Hwy. I ate at the restaurant on the top floor. Food was pricey for what you got and there are some funny discrepancies that can be found i.e. The chicken finger basket (chicken strips and french fries) is more expensive than if you order them seperately. Also, shrimp entree (1/2 lb. steamed shrimp with side and salad) was $10.00 more expensive than appetizer 1/2 lb. shrimp. I think $10.00 is excessive for house salad (bag mix) and side of (frozen) veggies. Overall, if you don't mind roughing it, the price is good at this hotel.

The staff was very friendly and even the maids were nice and willing to talk to you if you ask them a question, most of them spoke French but had very good English to convey a message. They had a n indoor pool with a little mushroom fountain which the kids loved. They also had sprinklers the kids could move around like a squirt gun on the sides of the pool. The adults could enjoy their large hot tub which was quite hot. The rooms were large, and you can get street view or bay view from the back if you are up high enough, We could see a little of the ocean from the 5th floor facing the Coastal highway. Parking was easy. We saw at least 5 wrecks when we were there on the Coastal Highway, I would recommend this hotel for people with older kids who can cross a busy highway safely but if you have little ones i would stay on the Ocean Block Side. This hotel runs about 119.00 with a aaa discount a night. it also has a lounge area vending machine room and arcade games. The hotel is much older than alot of Ocean City's hotels but it is spacious.

For $120, we got a dirty, run down, and UNREMODELED place. The sign said remodeled rooms. The bathtub did not drain, there was a smell of mildew and mold, the pool/hottub totally gross. The air conditioning/air ventilation system must have high mold/mildew concentration. I am sick now. There was drunken teenagers/college kids partying and trashing the place. I can't believe AAA gave this place a two-star rating. Unbelievable. I saw the pictures on this and other websites. I was fooled. I have travelled alot and I will for now on stay only in familiar named hotels, i.e. Comfort Inn, or Holiday Inn. Stay away from privately owned establishments unless you personnally know someone who has stayed there. Ocean City Maryland is such a rip off anyways but it's the closest for a beach weekend. Just be wary of any lodging/resturant in Ocean City Maryland.

We had a nice, comfortable, king size bed in our room, the AC worked great and the bed was far enough from the door that we didn't hear too much noise from the hallway (which we appreciated on one night when a group of drunken young women down the hall carried on until the wee hours). The first time we used the shower, it didn't drain very well, but the problem was fixed after we complained to the front desk. The room was cleaned very well each day. The restaurant (Jordan's) is decent -- very reasonable prices, okay service (nothing spectacular, mind you, but what do you expect from a bunch of kids working there for the summer?). It's very convenient and you won't get food poisoning. You have to go across the street to get to the beach, but that wasn't a big deal for us. There is plenty of free parking on-site and although you're a bit removed from downtown, that's what your car or the city bus is for. For the rate, I thought it was just fine and I would stay there again.", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNever Again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3759749", "Content": "Anyone with hotel experience will be very disappointed. I read the other reviews before we stayed, some good, some bad, so I gave the benefit of the doubt as a generally tolerant soul. Well, now I believe the other bad reviews, and the good ones must be anomalies. Where do I start: On arrival at 5 pm Sunday, there was a very long check-in line, into the parking lot, about an hour wait. The AAA tour book states a special feature is early check-ins & late checkouts, in reality, no way, they refused any check-in's prior to 4pm. At check-in, right in front of the lobby desk, a woman & man with a baby in stroller next to us, decided to open a case of beer & start chugging together while waiting, then spilling beer all over the floor including the stroller, nothing cleaned. Nice family atmosphere. The room was stinky, moldy, carpet nasty; we had to stay, & figured other rooms were worse, so cleaned & sprayed with a whole can of Lysol. The A/C was filthy, stunk, loud, and leaked condensation to soak the carpet, don't wear any socks. A drip from outside, the room a/c above, dripped on the metal windowsill like water torture all night. The windows do not open so forget any fresh air. The refrig had to be unplugged at night due to noise. The elevators were very slow, or did not work, stairs were a must, and the stairways sometimes had foul odors of urine or wacky tobacco. The pool seemed okay except we couldnt see through the water so we refrained. Jackhammer construction across the street for wake up calls. Extremely busy highway to cross to beach, unreal, like a major inner city loop, not safe for kids or unaware adults. If you are paying even $99 per night expect something better than tenement housing. Camping would be better.", "Date": "August 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNever Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3729953", "Content": "We have stayed at the Fenwick before, and were not overly impressed, but decided to give it a try as it posted as being \"remodelled\". We checked in and dressed to go out to dinner, and as we were leaving our room, noticed that the light fixture in front of our door in the hallway was On Fire!!! We broke the glass to the fire alarm and pulled it. We walked down, and the front desk told us (and others) they did not know if it was a fire or not. We assured them the wall was on fire, and to have people leave! Outside, people were complaining about how long it took to check in, bad service, and some, who were eating in the restaurant above the 7th floor (fire area) were told to continue eating. When I questioned the manager about this the next day, she said that the alarms go off all the time from the kitchen, so how would they really know? People were using the elevator to go down while the alarm was going off. The fire Marshall was not impressed with the hotel. Another comment was \"you get what you pay for\".The front desk was not helpful and only when pressed offered us 30 dollars off one night at the hotel for \"helping out\". They were not polite. I also questioned paying for a room that was Very noisy until 1:00 a.m. and she said were were told it was right under the restaurant/bar. I told her was had not been told this, and she said her staff wrote it in the comments, so it was true. I demanded another room for our second (and last ever night there) and they moved us. (again not a renovated room) Our frig did not work in the first room, and many electrical wires pug into a powerbar in each room. The clock radio flickered on and off if you moved it. I questioned being charged for a frig when it did not work, and she said we informed the wrong staff (no apologies) about the frig. We had to make 4 calls, spanning 1 1/2 hours for some extra blankets. Service sucks here, and the renovated rooms were no where to be seen.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at the Fenwick!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3353020", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Fenwick Inn with a group of 100 for a convention. The hotel was chosen because all other hotels in MD were sold out. Now I know why the Fenwick was available!! This hotel was fair at best. It is very tired and in desperate need of renovation. The hotel pool area was very poorly lighted, probably so that you could not notice that you could not see anything in the water past your waist. The pool towels were as big as hand towels and washed so many times you could see through them. When we checked into our room we found the room to have stains on the ceiling, dirty carpets and the blanket on the bed was soiled. When I called down to the front desk, I was told that I would have to wait my turn behind other guests because they had a long list and only one maid for fresh linens. Since it was 10:30 p.m. already, and I didn't want to wait any longer, I told her to please drop the sheets and blankets off so that I could make my own bed. After two phone calls, the sheets did arrive, but no blanket. When I asked the maid for a blanket she told me they had no more left. It makes you wonder how often the blankets are ever changed and washed if there is only one for each room. We had a sleeping bag in our car and used that for the weekend, since the blanket never showed up the next day either. Although the Jordon Roof Top restaurant is located in the hotel, we were told it was not affiliated with the hotel when my husband inquired at the desk to have the room service breakfast dishes removed from in front of the elevator area on the 4th floor at 8:00 p.m. Since the restaurant doesn't belong to the hotel, I don't know if the hotel can be blamed for this one or not, but another woman in our group ordered the lobster for room service and ended up spending the evening in the local hospital for food poisoning. Others in our group had many complaints as well, including only 2 of the 3 elevators working, only two luggage carts for hotel, dirty rooms, etc. Our group does plan on attending this same convention again in MD next year, but if we can not get 100 rooms all in the same hotel we will probably split up in lieu of staying at the Fenwick. No one in our group plans on going back to the Fenwick. However, when we checked out, they did take $20.00 off our room for it being dirty.", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNever ever again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3352139", "Content": "Not happy at all with the Fenwick- the website makes it look nice.

At first they weren't even going to move me because they said they were sold out and when I said my eyes were burning from the smoke smell they said \" that's a non-smoking floor\"- but finally offered me another room. The bathroom was not clean and the room had a hole in the corner of the ceiling from water leaks. The pool was so questionable looking the girls on the team wouldn't even swim in it.

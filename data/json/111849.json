I thought the staff was very nice, always asking if they could help. The rooms were the only disappointing part. They were very small and dated. I am talking popcorn ceilings and peeling wallpaper in the bathrooms. The rooms were cramped, making it difficult to move about with two adults and two kids. I mean, there was not even a closet, just an armoire. But, the beds were awesome, and that was the most important part to me. We liked the facility itself. Nice nice pools, especially compared to the hotels in the area (you could see them as you strolled the boardwalk). We had considered staying at the Sheraton, but after walking the grounds of the Sheraton, I am glad we chose Westin. That being said, if we go again, we'll probably splurge and stay at the Mona Kai. It was newer and seemed a lot nicer. Overall, the Westin was a good spot to bring little kids with the two water slides, one for big kids and one for little kids. Also, the pool-side cafe had a nice big children's menu. And, I enjoyed the location of the Westin, right next to Whaler's Village where you could grab some dinner. I recommend booking a whale-watching excursion through the Westin on the Gemini. It was great. Watch for the $25/day resort fee. Some of the guests did not know about it and were surprised that it was tacked on.

It was our first trip to Maui and after many months of research finally decided on Westin Maui because of the location (which is great). We arrived from Honolulu after a short 3 day stay there at around 1pm. We had a car and valet was great and very friendly. We were able to checkin early which is always nice. We were upgraded 1 category to deluxe ocean view. The room is typical Westin at first glance, but they really do need upgrading. The worst thing was the balcony. All the cement was crumbling on it so if you go out in bare feet your feet are covered in cement. Also, the view was look hard to your left and there's the ocean. This room was going for almost $600 a night! We didn't pay that, thank god (we used points). So, certainly for that price you go in with pretty high expectations. Very quickly noticed that there is alot of construction at the resort. They were redoing the area where the Luau is held so the adults only pool (another reason we booked here, we don't have kids) was listening to jackhammers all day for 10 days. Not impressed. The breakfast buffet is outrageous at $28 per person. We always ordered off the menu as the meals were plenty of food for more than half the price of the buffet. We did eat at the hotel once at night but the service was terrible. So incredibly slow. I'm not used to that especially at a $600 a night hotel. Another night we went to the \"lounge/restaurant\" for a nitecap. After waiting for our drinks for half an hour and being told over and over \"they are coming\" we just left. No thanks, $15 for a drink too! The location is great, right next to Whaler's village. We loved that and ate at the restaurants there every night.

Now, after my own stay here, I am convinced that some of those posters must work for a competitor!! Positives of the hotel - - The grounds at the hotel are beautiful - waterfalls, flamingos, pool areas, etc etc. Beach is beautiful. - HAPPY HOUR from 5-6 is a must - you have to get the $5 mai tais... out of this world! Live music is also playing as well, so great to either sit on your balcony and listen/drink or stay near the pool. - Location is great as well - while I would agree that other resorts are a bit better in terms of overall \"ambience\" (think Ritz, for example), the great thing about this resort is that it's right next to Whaler's Village if you feel like getting off the resort, and also only a 10 min shuttle to Lahaina. You don't feel like you're stuck here. - Service: everyone was really helpful, from concierge to wait staff. - Weather: can't beat Ka'anapali... lots more rain just 10 mins north (kapalua) and much windier in the south. - Beds! If you ever slept in a heavenly bed, you know what I mean. To be fair, some things could be improved on. Our room wasn't ready at check in (about 1 hour late in getting ready), so that could have been taken care of a bit better. I was also a little disappointed in the hot tub as it's not one of those completely in-ground ones and looks as though they forgot about it in the plans and added it at the end. Room was nice, but not spectacular. Overall, a great stay. It takes about a day to wind down and realize that you're in Maui where things are not so fast-paced, but once you reach that point you don't want to leave!! I hear some of the reviews that mention things could have been better/improved upon, etc, but if I'm not mistaken, that is what a 4 star hotel is - fantastic, but has a few areas that can be improved upon and are not as good as 5 star.

The 5 star rating is almost entirely because of Aliko (sp?) who recognized our disappointment with the room we were originally given on the 3rd floor of the ocean tower. We ponied up for ocean view to make sure we had a good spot. However, I guess since it was part of an \"escape package\" (better deal?), it ended up being hardly what you could call ocean view. You could see slivers of the ocean through all the trees and resort grounds so it wasn't technically false advertising but we were very very disappointed. Also, since it was a two queen room, there was very little space for us to get around - my wife is pregnant and we brought our 3 year old who slept in a crib so it was really cramped. I went to the front desk right away and was not mean or pushy but said we were not happy with the view and that we felt cramped. Aliko went to work and found us a great room in the beach tower on the 7th floor. It was AMAZING! It had an awesome view, was a single king room and had about 100 sq ft more room than what we had originally. We are SOOOOOOOO thankful that Aliko did this for us. It is because of him that this gets 5 stars. In reality, it was what we were expecting for what we paid (even with the \"escape package\" - it wasn't cheap). The positives: Aliko (as I said, he made this trip for us because of the room change/ upgrade). In addition to Aliko, Carlito and Elena at the host stand for breakfast were always very very sweet to our family. In addition to the people I mentioned, the property, pools, beach, grounds, rooms (ocean view in the beach tower) are really really great. I've heard others talk about the tired feel or the property/ rooms and that this isn't Westin quality but I've stayed at other Westin properties and this is definitely up to par. The beach location couldn't be better - right on the beachwalk that goes past Blackrock/ the Sheraton on one side and past the Hyatt on the other. Totally beautiful. I'm all about the beach and this place delivers. Close to the best beach I've seen in Hawaii (I've been the Big Island, Maui 5 times, Kauai, Lanai, and Oahu). By best beach in Hawaii, I'm really talking about all of Ka'anapali but right in front of the Westin is no better or worse than any other place in Ka'anapali unless you want to walk right out of your hotel and snorkel which is pretty good at Blackrock (which again, is not a far walk from the Westin). The pools and slides are beautiful, great too - plenty of room to swim around through waterfalls, into a little cave pool area, etc. Our daughter loved it. Lots of pool chairs and only sort of had trouble finding an open one the first day we were there (we did find a spot for the whole family so it wasn't a problem). I'm not a spa guy but did go there the last day we were there because it was raining. It was really really nice. Probably on par with other great hotel spas but I was very impressed. If it wasn't Hawaii and the beaches and pools weren't so awesome, I would probably have spent more time in the spa/ fitness center because it was so nice, relaxing, clean, quiet, etc. My wife got a couple massages there and said it was great. So, in summary on the positives, the place is really, really nice. It felt worth what I paid but in the eyes of the Westin, I probably got a lot more than I paid for because of the upgrade. On the negatives - the past 10 days felt very very crowed. I think they were bursting at the seams (which I why I was so amazed that we got the better room). I don't mind a lot of people at a place but it meant that the personalized service/ attention (other than those I mentioned) was difficult for them to deliver on. They got you what you needed and did respond to issues (see below) but I think they could have used a few more people to man the front desk, etc. I've been to other resorts in Hawaii where you come in, they put a flower lei on you, they give you something refreshing to drink, give you a cold towel, sit you down and explain everything to you and make you feel special at check-in. Here, they have to get you through quick because there were so many people waiting to be helped at all hours of the day. Parking was cramped but when it was full, they gave you free valet so you never had a problem getting a spot. However, the spaces were very close together (similar to other places in West Maui). I recommend not getting anything larger than a full size car if you stay here because of the tight parking spaces. We did have problems with our toilet. It just could handle any toilet paper going down it (similar to South America or some places in Europe I've been to). I'm almost positive this was an isolated incident to our room but we had to have them come 6 times to unclog it. We even had to use the bathrooms near the Ono grill instead of our room because of the problem. They always came promptly to take care of it but it was a little annoying/ embarrassing having to call almost every morning to have them come take care of it. A relatively small sacrifice to pay for such a great room but if I had paid for the room outright, this would have really made me upset. We did see one cockroach. The body of it was about 1 1/2 inches long. It was right outside our room and we shewed it away so, as far as we know, it wasn't in our room while we were but unfortunately, when we shewed it away, it ran under our neighbor's door - sorry! Positive/ negative - the buffet breakfast was totally awesome but it better be because it was $30/ per person. Fortunately our 3yr old was free. I know this is pretty standard cost-wise for breakfast buffets at nice resorts but it still always feels steep to me. They have an alternative in the resort where you can get a la carte items and only spend about $15/ person to get a decent breakfast. Despite the cost, we ate at the buffet almost every morning and I don't regret it at all. The selection was great, food was great but the bonus at the Westin that is better than other nicer resort $30 buffets I've ponied up for was the view. If they tell you or you ask for it, you can get ocean view seating (they seat you where the Tropica restaurant is). So great to sit there in the morning and have breakfast with the family next to the ocean. Tropica restaurant was pretty good. We only ate there one night so we could experience all the other great places nearby (Roy's, Leilani's upstairs and down, the Hula grill, etc.). At Tropica, I did the tasting menu which I now kind of regret because the main course was steak (I like steak but this one seemed to have some sort of alcohol base in the sauce which was too overpowering). The big positive surprise was the baked Hawaii. I wasn't expecting anything but this was delicious! I liked it even better than Roy's molten chocolate cake or the Hula pie at Leilani's. So, a total tangent to the Westin review but the perfect meal in Ka'anapali is Roy's regular green's salad (the creamy sauce is great), the Walu (if they have it) at the Hula grill and then baked Hawaii at Tropica. In summary, it was a great trip thanks to the upgrade from Aliko - otherwise, I think I would have felt shorted.

The room was okay, but this resort is so big that I felt like I was stuck in a German sardine can. There were three pools but none of them were big. If you didn't get up really early and reserve your chairs, you might not get a spot. Pools are way too crowded. Food is not good enough. I don't care that it was expensive , but expensive and crappy food is not okay. If you have an endless supply of money, don't mind paying $12 for a watered down drink, poor food and thirty to sixty dollars for a pool or beach cabana or lounge chairs, then this is your paradise. Everyone is between 50 and 70. The resort bars shut down by 11pm. Again, I hate people who whine about how expensive a place is without doing any research . I knew this was an expensive place to go. What I don't like is spending well over 15 thousand for a 3 week vacation and not enjoying myself.

Parking- As you see in almost every review, it is very tight and most of it is built for mini-Coopers. We only had a couple of times we could not find a place, and the hotel was very accomodating about valet; didn't even charge me for the first night when I used valet on purpose for check in. HINT- go to the last row in self-parking if you have a SUV or bigger car. The spaces are larger, particularly against the back fence. Overview- Very pretty property with a nice lagoon with pink flamengos. Good layout to get to everything and no real problem getting around. Only 5 minutes from Lahaina and 10 from Kapalua. Give yourself 45-50 minutes from the main airport as there is only one road and plenty of traffic. Only consistent service gripe was that it look usually 1-2 minutes for someone to pick up on the Guest Service line whenever you called. I guess it's just a busy place. Check In- No surprise here that we did not get an upgrade even with Starwood Preferred statud and AMEX Platinum booking. They weren't mean about it, but don't expect them to go out of their way to help you find an upgraded room. If you want a better room, better book it. Room- Mehh. It was ok, pretty much like rooms I stay in weekly for business. View was very nice. We were on the 7th floor for an Ocean View room and looked out over the lagoon and out to the ocean. Lagoon and birds are noisy if you plan to keep the sliding door open, but drowned out most of the noise when closed. Room definitely needs a makeover; new paint, fixtures, carpet, would help. Bed was the Heavenly Bed, which was very comfortable which is always important. I give Westin props for always investing here. Resaurants- I did not each the $35 breakfast buffet so cannot comment, though it looked good. We ate at Tropica the first night and got a table on the beach (or on the golf grass in front of it). Everything was fanstastic and definitely recommend going there. We also ate at the Hula Grill next door at the Whaler's Village, which was also very good and I recommend it. Leilana's is also quite good in the same place. Beach/Pool- Didn't really get in the pool, but they looked great. Rented a cabana for the beach and had great service all day. Pretty cheap (only $60 for the whole day) and worth it to have better service and some privacy. You can look right out to the Molokai and we saw a number of whales throughout the day. Check out- This is the one place they get a 0, or 1 star if I have to. Called for help with bags. After 15 minutes, called again. After another 10 minutes, gave up and hauled down bags ourselves. My wife let them have it the desk. Better service needed here. Overall, it was a very nice time, and the negatives were not enough to detract from our experience. I would have expected a little better from Westin, but I think this hotel is extremely busy and well used, and they have not taken to effort to renovate where needed. Service could use an upgrade if they ever aspire to add a star to their rating. It is average with some bright spots (restaurants, valet, and beach) and lows (front desk, Guest Service,a dn bell service).

Upon arrival we noted that the grounds were still quite beautiful and were greeted warmly and escorted the the \"newer\" Beach Tower where we used to stay many years ago. We are Starwood preferred guests and expected a nicer room and good location but to our dismay our room was close to the elevator, over looking the top of a pavillion and part of a pool area and had a partial ocean view. While we were not thrilled with our view we were even more disturbed with the cleanliness of the room. The furniture was extremely dusty, there were numerous finger prints and marks on the door, greasy looking areas on the headboard, a marble shelf next to a coffee station with sticky residue and a rusted cracking cabinet that housed a refrigerator. A dirty decorator pillow and the frosting on the cake was finding some prior guests underwear still on a shelf in the closet!!!!!!! We tried changing rooms but were told they were completely booked and had to have housekeeping come three times before it was acceptable. Additionally through all of the complaining it was very difficult to get through to guest services to even get attention and had to literally go downstairs to the front desk to complain. Next problem was the restaurant Tropica with cold food and beyond slow service that made our first night the beginning of a disappointing trip to paradise. The pool areas are beautiful but crowded with the most uncomfortable chairs, no cushions unless you want to rent a cabana you cannot get a cushion!! The highlight of this hotel are the bellmen, valet's who have been there for many years and still are extremely helpful personable and cheerful.

The sink and the adjacent area over the \"bar type refrigerator\" with coffee pot was very small. The beds were lovely, comfortable Heavenly Beds. Overall, I'd say the room was smaller than we expected for the price; however, that said, this is Maui and this is a prime location.

We felt it was heaven on Earth. The hotel is beautiful, from the grounds to the pool and beach. We did not get an ocean view to save some money, we weren't in the room enough to justify the extra couple hundred dollars a night. But we did check out the ocean view in some friends we met room and it was amazing, truly beautiful. The rooms were very clean and a good size. Pool- The pool is amazing, it was a great time with plenty of room to lay out and relax when we were there. We only ate the pool side food once but it was the chicken nachos, and they were very very good, especially for pool food. Drinks were pricy at the pool. But you could walk into the hotel and buy cheaper beers from the gift shop and take them out there. But the best move we made was buying booze and mixers at a store in town and making drinks and taking them to the pool with us. Lots of Malibu rum and Hawaiian Sun drinks! They were great! Bring a small collapsible cooler with you to bring drinks down to the pool with you, or buy one for around seven bucks at the store. There was a nice bar just off the pool as well to watch some sports and belly up to the bar. It was a great group of people it seemed, not too many kids. We are both around 30 and we met many people to have fun with if we wanted, but we spent most of our time spending it together. There were a lot of pregnant women on baby-moons and they had a great time. Location - The location was amazing. Whalers Village right next door with all sorts of restaurants and shops. Hula Grill, Leilani's, and Kane and Taro right next door for great food as well as the in house restaurants and Starbucks. It had everything we needed and wanted. We were a twenty minute drive to Lahina for all the shops, galleries, restaurants and just overall awesome time. We ate at Cheeseburger in Paradise which was great, the Lahina Pizza Company was over priced. The beach walk right in front was a great way to see the beach. Just to the right, looking at the ocean, past Whalers Village is a little hut to rent snorkeling and other sports equipment. Just a ten minute walk takes you to the Black Rock where the snorkeling is wonderful. Enjoy! We took a boat out to Molokai to snorkel. It was ok, a little pricy considering there was a great place to snorkel just a ten minute walk away. The parking was good. If you got in late at night or when they were packed they would valet at no additional cost. We arrived and check in went well, the lobby is beautiful. We went to our room and it was on the third floor overlooking the parking lot. I didn't like this so called and asked for a change, they changed us the next day to a room on a higher floor which was much better, however, we were right next to an elevator which was actually very disturbing. But we dealt with it because we didn't want to move again. One night the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate. It was a trek, but it was a small kitchen fire or something like that. So, no big deal. This was the best trip of our lives, and we have a trip to Kauai' planned for next month. We could have eaisly gone back to the Westin, but wanted to try a new place out.

If not you call Costco from your cell at the front desk. They will correct it. The property in general is what you would expect from Westin...beautiful grounds and good service. What is not typical Westin is the lack of attention to upkeep and cleanliness of the rooms. You can see that the landscape and common areas is where the revenue re-investment goes. We had a very nice premium ocean view room that had seen a lot of turn over without a good cleaning. Stained carpet, dusty, dirty walls and a bathroom that had not been sanitized since...well who knows. I had them send housekeeping after we unpacked but not a lot improved.

I'll start with the positive. First, the location is good, and the common areas are pretty and fairly well kept. The pool areas are fine. The rooms all have balconies, which is nice. Those are really the only highlights. The rooms and especially the bathrooms were pretty gross. Our bathroom had such a strong mildew smell to it I searched for a hidden wet towel that had gone un-noticed. The tub was dirty, the door was institutional, and the decor was just depressing. I have seen nicer bathrooms in hospitals. The cleaning staff did a very cursory job of cleaning each day. Even more shocking was that they didn't actually clean the rooms until the afternoon. On our first full day, our room remained unclean until 2:30 PM. They barely make the bed for you and don't straighten anything, so I am unclear as to what takes so long. There is nothing even close to turndown service. For the first two nights, our cleaning lady's scent- a mixture of soap and bad perfume- permeated the room and the sheets. The service across the board was almost laughably bad. When I complained about the stench in the bathroom and the cleanliness of the room, they said they would have to call me back, but never did. A couple days later, we asked for some cotton swabs and they said they would have them sent to our room. They never did. I'm a Starwood Gold member, so I thought that may invite some concern for our happiness, but it only got us an unsolicited sales pitch for a new property they are building nearby. The room came out to be over $400/ night, so it was a fairly high price to pay for such poor service and a terrible room. I really would recommend looking elsewhere.

I sent the guest manager, Sean an email a month prior to our trip to let him know this was our first trip with a Starwood Property and that we were very excited to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary during this trip. Upon arrival, we were greeted by several valet attendants who all welcomed us with huge smiles and helped us with the kids and our bags. At check in, I was excited to learn we had been upgraded to an Ocean View room by Sean. Will brought our bags up to our room and gave us a quick yet detailed run down of the property and what to do and how to get there. Our room was fantastic! Great view of the ocean, the pools and the whales every morning! We went out for dinner shortly after for less than two hours and returned to find a delicious cake and a bottle of champagne waiting for us!!! Thanks Westin! That was the best birthday I had ever had, HANDS DOWN! And that was just the first night. We enjoyed some relaxation time in the pools with the kids the first night after a long day of flying. The second day, we retrieved our vehicle from valet and the attendants told us some Road to Hana tips and even loaned us a CD with a guided tour to help us on the trip. Each and every hotel employee that we came in contact with had a smile on their face and made us feel like we were at home and were the most important person on property. The people who claim everyone was rude or unconcerned with them, I can only think that you get what you receive. Smile at someone, and someone will smile back. On occasion, the line at the front desk was long and the process seemed a bit tedious. If you want something quicker, check and see if you can find a Holiday Inn near by and go there if that's the biggest concern you have. YOU ARE ON VACATION. IN HAWAII. RELAX. The rooms are great, the beds somewhat heavenly, I am pretty picky when it comes to beds and I slept like a baby on them. The rooms were quiet, which is a huge deal for me as I am a light sleeper. The fridge was a great plus to have in the room to keep drinks cold, and a few snacks on hand with the kids. My brother in law even got a microwave in his room to warm food and formula up for their daughter. I was never concerned with anyone jumping on to my patio to break into my room, not from the 9th floor, and I wouldn't have from the 2nd floor either. The sliding glass door has two very suitable locks. Use them if you feel it necessary. The only problem I had with the property involved the internet. I never EVER leave my credit card on file with a hotel after a HORRIBLE problem with another property that you can read about in my other reviews. For some odd reason, not having a card on file prevents you from accessing the free wi-fi that comes with the resort fee. This boggles my mind, because my resort fee had been paid for, why does that not cover my wi-fi? It also covers parking and not having a card on file didn't effect this. I think that is something Westin needs to work out to ensure a better hotel experience. On one occasion, we also didn't get housekeeping while we were out, we left later in the day when they came by I am sure and a quick call to the front desk had it taken care of upon our arrival while we were at dinner. I also think there should be some double checking by housekeeping for rooms that don't get cleaned in the morning because not everyone gets up and our by 10 or 11 AM. Other than those two issues, and the fact that the parking spots are very tight and people don't know how to park in between the lines, this place is spectacular! The staff is wonderful, in fact I have never been to a hotel with a more friendly staff. There is golf right across the way, several amazing restaurants with great seafood.

However, many of the cleaning staff and bellhop staff are very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, and the common areas (pool, lobby, etc) are pretty nice. Bottom line; next time you're on Maui stay at a nicer place, even if it costs more. The Ritz Carlton in Kapalua and the Four Seasons in Kihei are more expensive, but you get a lot more out of it.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "hms4uk", "ReviewID": "UR123308559", "Content": "Great Location, Great Staff, Great Rooms....

You can't beat their stretch of beach and the 5 pools and slide are awesome. Our room was deluxe ocean view with a great view of Black Rock. Being right next door to Whalers Village is nice. Fair Notice: They have HARD mattresses. If you like this, great. I prefer a softer mattress. Ask for Foam pillows if you don't like down. We got every 3rd night free and free breakfast. The parking does have small slots BUT the last two rows by the tennis courts are a good size so just use them. The beach is AWESOME. So are the pools. If you have kids this is a huge plus. BIG HINT: Don't buy a boogie board. Every day we saw them piled up by the garbage cans from people who had gone home. Also, try the lost and found and ask if they have any leftover beach or pool toys. You'd be surprised. Yes the concierge hit you up for a timeshare presentation but they are very polite about it. Just say no and that's the end of it. The luau was a lot of fun. Great location near the beach. If you like the fire knife dancing this is the one for you. We tried the Sheraton luau and it just wasn't as good. The Westin Luau is table service. They bring a course and put it on a lazy Susan. The show was very good. We had a premium table which was nice. We never had problems with the staff. They were always nice to us. If I may? Treat them like people, not staff. Ask them how they are, smile! Also, you came to Hawaii. Learn to run on Hawaii time. I think this is huge. Go with the flow and you'll be fine. RELAX. This is a family hotel. Lots of kids. Know this up front and make your decision accordingly. The resort fee is what it is. Nobody likes it, every hotel seems to have it. Load up on the waters and coffees and shampoos in your room. You paid for them! Wireless Internet has improved a lot since last year. Basic speed in your room included in resort fee. Are things pricey? Duh, this is Maui. Maui is pricey. Load up on Costco and K mart goodies. The Resort Aspect? There is an activity hut by Ono restaurant and activities are posted in the lobby. Your kids can feed the koi fish in the lobby. Just ask about it. Honestly the pool, waterfall and slides and beach do a great job amusing kids of all ages. Shout out to specific staff: Carlito and Jocelyn at Ono. The cleaning Staff on the 9th floor of the beach tower. Ray the Concierge. Melissa Stephen, Manager. To sum up? Get a deal, ask for the Beach Tower on a high floor away from the elevator. RELAX. Be nice to people. Be aware this is a hotel that is big with families. The pools are great for kids. Park in the last two rows for a bigger spot. if there's a problem don't freak out and just try and get it dealt with. I will stay here again.

The rooms at the hotel are becoming more and more outdated and really need to be refreshed.

I get the buffet, restaurants and bars being on the higher end but the Starbucks prices were beyond exorbitant with the majority of the items being $4-6$ each. 4 drinks and 4 pastries was $40. 3. Customer service has gone down from my previous visit. Concierge staff seemed disinterested in helping with recommendations and rushed us off vs. the last time I was there the staff was extremely helpful. Concierge used to give lots of perks for Platinum members (chocolates etc.) but now they don't offer much of anything unless you go on a timeshare tour. 4. Other charges have gone up ($37 for 2 chairs on the beach for 1 day - come on!).

We called our credit card company and Villi immediately, but have not been refunded the total amount as of yet. We felt that everyone should know about this situation in case it happens to other guests of the hotel as well. The other smaller issue is that because of the payment issues with getting the Tikkis, we forgot to pick up our luau photo at the end of the luau.

The hotel was PACKED while we stayed and yet we didn't have any trouble scoping out two chairs for my husband and I to relax while the kids swam.

We walked to Black Rock (5 minutes) and were snorkeling with turtles. The beach was clean and sand was great. Whaler's Village proximity made life easy as well since we could grab a \"cheap\" lunch at the food court or a nice sunset dinner at Leilani's (with Hula Pie!)

He also offered to loan us boogie boards for the week. By the next morning, there were two boards at the front desk FOR FREE (which we returned at the end.) My only complaints are the $25 a day fee but I must say we tried to get our monies worth. And the onsight restaurants were quite pricy. We went into Safeway in town and stocked up on breakfast foods and lunch makings since we had the frig and microwave though to combat the prices the Westin wanted.

The white sand beach is great to swim in and walk along, and there are tons of activities like surfing, snorkeling, volcano tours, etc. The only downside is that in adition to room rate and the $25 daily resort fee, you still have to pay for things like beach chairs, etc. But you do get free fruit flavored ice water and starbucks coffee when its dark :)", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, nice location, but...\u201d", "Author": "SoCalSD3", "ReviewID": "UR122475053", "Content": "Overall, we had a very nice stay at the Westin Maui resort and spa, but all was not perfect in paradise. We had an ocean view room and we there for 6 nights (12/26 - 1/1). This was our first big vacation with our 2 year old son outside the mainland, so there are a couple thoughts to share. We have traveled (airplane) about 5 times with our son already, but most travel has been in the lower 48 States. Checkin - I have never seen a check-in process this chaotic. We got to the hotel about 1pm, put our name in and they said they would call us when the room was ready. This seemed perfect, however we did not get our room until 5pm (2 hours late.) If it was just my wife and I this would have been fine, but with a kid in tow it can be a little nightmare. I witnessed this happen to about 10-15 families...which should not happen at a hotel chain like the Westin. When you're spending good money, you expect a room at 3pm checkin. My wife and I have traveled a decent amount around the Caribbean, Mexico, S Pacific and have never seen this type of chaos before. I noticed it happen every day as we walked by the lobby. The hotel did comp us (and others) for the delay, but I would have much rather had the room at 3pm to get settled and enjoy the day. Room - Our ocean view room was good. We were in center of hotel on 6th floor with a pretty nice view. However, anyone on our side of the hotel was pretty close to the lobby waterfall, so it was loud at night. You could sleep with windows open, but it was surprisingly loud. I can't imagine those rooms right above the lobby waterfall, it must have sounded like they were sleeping inside the waterfall. The beds, although the heavenly bed, were not good. They were old and need to be replaced. Pool - The pool is very nice. However, we had some high winds (35 mph+) the first couple of days, so the pool was cold. Most of the little one's we saw (under 3/4) and spoke with were not in the pool as you froze in and when you got out. The older kids were fine. Our son spends about 200 days a year in the pool since we live in San Diego, but our pools are heated, so I guess Westin is trying to save money. Prepare to wake up at 6am to reserve your pool chair, otherwise you are out of luck. Beach - The beach is beautiful and great for people watching, activities etc. However, due to the steep drop off, this is not a good beach for kids under 3 years old. There's no way for them to wade around and play safely. We went down to baby beach in Lahaina which was perfect to chill and wade in for our son, so if you're in the area head down there for a day. For older kids the beach in fine. You can also jump on the many catamaran's right from the beach to whale watch, snorkel etc. This is very convenient. We rented the beach cabana's for 2 days which was very nice (although it's $60/day), so if you're looking for some chill time I would recommend it. Just make sure you reserve it early as they sell out. Food - food on-site is good, although prepare to pay. The breakfast buffet is pretty nice and you can sit in the Tropica restaurant right on the water and people watch or see whales breaching in the distance. It was also nice as kids under 3 eat for free with their parents at the Ono restaurant (near pool.) For those of you with young kids you know eating can be fun adventure, so having free meals all week was nice. At night the Ono restaurant has live music which our son loved to listen to. Premises - the landscaping, ponds, birds etc on premise are pretty amazing. They have done a beautiful job and our son loved to watch the waterfalls, Flamingos, Koi fish, parrots etc. It was a great activity just to walk around the premises. Nearby - The Westin is right next to Whaler's village which has 2-3 nice restaurants (Hula Grill, Leilani's and Cane & Taro) as well as high end shops, grocery stores, ice cream etc. It's a great place to eat, walk around and just enjoy the night air. The Westin is also close to Lahaina which has calm beaches and a great little downtown to eat and stroll around in. Overall the Westin is a nice hotel but needs to be updated and run a little more efficiently. As stated in other reviews, the Westin also nickle and dimes you for just about everything, which I don't necessarily mind, but it can add a decent amount of money to your trip, so budget accordingly.

The Westin Maui Resort is the perfect spot for a family to enjoy a vacation by the beach. However there are a few gotchas you should be aware of when staying at the Westin Maui Resort & Spa. I found that everything at the hotel was very expensive. It seemed the hotel was more interested in making money than focusing on customer service than making sure guests have a good time. Coffee, kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk, Orange Juice will cost you $4. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s double what Starbucks charges for the same cup of coffee. Go downtown Lahaina to Starbucks instead. Pineapple pieces for breakfast are $8. Breakfast buffet was around $20 per person but kids are free. Beach umbrellas and chairs are $37 per day if you can get a reservation. I got charged $18 for parking for the first night. Basic Internet access is free however if you need more bandwidth its $14. This is all on top of the ridiculous $25 per day resort fee. Try getting the hotel to remove the resort fees when checking out. I had the resort fees removed. Be advised that the checkin process was slow. Checkin counter seemed understaffed and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to provide me with a room until after 3pm. Even with prior communication with the hotel regarding our arrival time etc. Next time I will ignore those emails from Starwood asking if I have any special requests for our staff. Basically the hotel never received the information. The Westin Maui Resort & Spa has four or more concierge counters located on the property. An American express travel desk is also located in the lobby. I would recommend not getting to comfortable chatting with the concierge staff. Their goal is to schedule a tour of the Westin Maui Villas. I was suckered into taking a tour of the Villas. Waste of three hours unless you have $100k and interested in buying a timeshare. Just collect your Westin Bag, map and view the restaurant menus book available on the desk. Use opentable to reserve restaurants. I also got a box of chocolates from the concierge counter. If you take a tour of the Villas ask for the $100 spa voucher. I highly recommend taking advantage of the SPA services. Massage was awesome. Book the massage for the second day. Also recommend using the SPA facilities. The hot tube and relaxation room are heavenly. Guess that is why they call it the heavenly spa. The gym is also brilliant. The gym has a great selection of machines and weights. Our room was an ocean view overlooking the ocean and pool. Highly recommend request an upgrade for an ocean view. The Mountain View rooms look directly over the car park. The rooms are dated and based on the popcorn on the ceiling I would say date back to the 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I heard a rumor that a renovation/upgrade will happen in the New Year. With almost 120 nights in a Starwood hotel this year, the Westin Maui Resort & Spa has the worst bed. Every morning I woke up with a bad back. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the hotel uses Westin beds. The beds sank in the middle. I spoke with the front desk about the bed but not action was taking to replace the bed. The toilet also flushed by itself. However the rooms seemed to be well insulated. I never heard the neighbors. Room comes with a coffee machine and refrigerator. I heard you can request a microwave. There are four pools and one hot tube located on the property. I found that you needed to reserve your spot by the pool at 7am. By 9am all the pool chairs where gone. One day I did ask the staff to help me locate a spot by the pool. I was never able to reserve the private cabanas. I never ordered food by the pool. Instead walked over to whaler village and ordered food from the food court of fish tacos from Lahaina on the beach. If I go back to Kaanapali I will look into staying at the Sheraton or another resort. I found the Westin badly managed with a don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care attitude. I was never able to speak with the manager even after requesting his or her contact information. However on the last day I did discover a true gem. Her name is Dawn. I believe Dawn is the only Starwood representative on the property. I would recommend calling dawn prior to your arrival to request an upgrade to best available room etc.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moraga, California", "Title": "\u201cHotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "UR122291566", "Content": "Wonderful hotel.

Christmas on Kaanapali Beach is a unique experience - crowds are just about everywhere. But, this time also stretches the staff to its limits and that's why I think my experience at the Westin is particularly noteworthy. On check-in, I was not satisfied with my room and discussed my concerns with one of the front-desk managers, Giadee Kaiwi. Remember, the place was crowded. To my surprise, Giadee worked for several hours in the background to assist me and almost \"miraculously\" all of my concerns were resolved. The next day, I got a call from Giadee, who brought me a little package of home-made cookies she had baked on her day off. I think this is a unique touch - in over 1 million miles of business travel, I never had that type of experience. Over the next 10 days, I got to know a number of other staff members at the Westin and realized that Giadee is not unique. I believe the Westin has an outstanding staff, giving their very best to make their guests feel welcome even at 100% occupancy rate. I find that remarkable. I give them five stars on service and staff dedication. Overall, I like this place a lot. It is conveniently located, has great grounds, good restaurants, and a spectacular architecture.

Apparently, because of other similar complaints, the manager couldn't see us for another three hours. We waited.

We were initially told there were no king rooms available, but after some some persistence, she eventually was able to find one. Our room was small, but comfortable. Bathroom was adequate, but nothing fancy. Bed was very comfortable. We had a mountain view room, over the parking lot. The view was actually very nice, and I really enjoyed watching the sunrises. The balcony doors are not at all soundproof, so I would suggest bringing earplugs if you are noise sensitive. Ammenities- we loved the pool areas and the waterslides. Lots of places to relax and we did not feel crowded at all. My husband used the gym and said it was adequate, nice view, but could use more weight equipment. We snorkled at Black Rock and loved our experience there- saw rays and green sea turtles. Restaurants- we ate had room service once, and had drinks during happy hour at the pool side bar. There are 3 hours of happy hour deals at the hotel, and this offers great value. The location of this hotel is very convenient to Whaler's Village and the other hotels on Ka'anapali beach.

We had planned on staying at the Hyatt on Ka'anapali Beach where we had honeymooned but the construction changed that. Instead we booked at the Westin. Wow, what a place. We had a terrible flight and felt awful when we arrived and we were looking for something to perk us up. At check in I inquired about the possibility of an upgrade from our Mountain View room to an Ocean View. Boy did they deliver! We were given a room on the 10th floor overlooking the pools and ocean. The balcony was the perfect place to sit with a bottle of wine and watch the sunset. The entire staff was awesome. Nathan at the bell desk loaded up all our luggage, grabbed us some ice and gave us great dinner recommendations for our first night. Tropica Restaurant is great. We went a couple of times and sat at the bar for appetizers and drinks. Tommy and Freddy are great bartenders there and make sure you try the Kona Lava Red and the Pohaku. One of the high points for us was the adults only pool. Even though the hotel has 5 pools we never left this one. It's enjoyable to be able to relax with a drink and not worry about getting splashed or listening to kids. The pool side bar is located there and they are great for drinks and lunch. One negative would be the hot tub. Not sure why but the hotel had the temp cranked really high on it. It was impossible to put more than your feet into it. The hot tub was the meeting place and a great place to hang out with new friends and talk about island experiences, restaurants or just share a drink. The beach in front of the hotel is great! Perfect waves for beginner surfers and I recommend you try it. Josh and Phil at the surf desk are great teachers. We arranged a dive at Black Rock through the tour desk and Doug is a great dive guide. The sea life and visability is perfect.

She loves to dance and the Ocean bar played great music. Our rooms were very new, nice, clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The view from the bath-tub was fabulous. you could open the double doors from the tub and the curtains form the master bed and see the ocean while you took a jacuzzi. The resort has 4 pools for swimming and 2 for Koi fish. They let you feed the fish, so my son participated during feeding hours. The main pool, near the Ocean bar, has a very fun, long water slide. But you have to be able to swim on your own to go down. My son and husband were banned from going down in tandem. We really loved our suite and would recommend it.

I'm glad I did because the Westin is beautiful and service is top notch. Everyone is extremely friendly and the aloha spirit is alive and well here. It is infectious and the guests can't help but be sucked right in. Yes, the hotel and its restaurants are expensive and there is a resort fee, but you get what you pay for and then some. The food will always be delicious and the service will always be fantastic. You will never be disappointed and that counts for a lot! A couple times the parking lot was full. In those instances, they valet for free so there is no wasting time circling the lot. The beach in front is great with a rough patch to the left for good surfing and gentle surf elsewhere for swimming. The location can't be beat. You can walk to Black Rock in 5 minutes or less for great snorkeling or jumping off Black Rock. The huge two level shopping area, Whaler's Village, is next door. Fantastic restaurants like Leilanis and Cane & Taro are in Whaler's Village. The adults only pool is major plus because this is a big family resort and there is still an oasis for singles and couples. The bar in the adults only area is really cool with friendly bar tenders and servers pool side. We needed a late check-out and with no issues were given a 2pm check-out. We needed wine glasses and a cork screw and room service delivered them incredibly quick. The grounds are meticulously cared for and lush green. The activities booth on the grounds (American Express Tours) is good and very helpful. Their scuba is excellent for beginners! Beware: the people at the surfing booth are great, but their equipment is not. For example, their paddle boards don't have leashes so if you fall off you are swimming frantically for your board -- that's bad!! Their surf boards are beat up too, but at least have leashes. So if you want to paddle board (and I hightly recommend it), you have to go to Trilogy Ocean Sports and Beach Center right in front of the Kaanapali Beach Hotel.

Here's what we experienced: NEGATIVES: We arrived extremely exhausted from Australia and just wanted to check-in, dump our bags and freshen up. Unfortunately, our room wasn't ready so we went for a walk, got a coffee and sat by the pool until we could. This is where the first hiccup was ... got our key, entered the lift, got out and our room was right next to the lifts, we remained positive until we entered the room to find we were looking out over a concrete rooftop, plus looking straight at the side of the Ocean Tower (a blank concrete wall) plus three huge air-conditioning turbines/cooling towers!!!! Oh yeah, we'd found paradise ... NOT. We booked an Ocean View Room (confirmed six months prior) and advised that we were SPG members (obviously, that counted for nothing). So we grabbed our bags and headed straight back down to reception absolutely fuming mad. Luckily my husband handled the situation (as I couldn't speak due to the tears welling in my eyes). After a firm discussion with the desk clerk, begrudingly he found us another room two floors up on the 7th floor overlooking the pools with a 180 degree view of the beach - suddenly, our holiday improved 100%. So our question was, why put guests through this trauma in the first place? Finally, let the timeshare thing go people - stop nagging every guest who arrives ... very 1980's and unprofessional. POSTIVES: Apart from the first hiccup, we had an absolutely fabulous time. The five pools were fantastic, plenty of lounge chairs to relax in, the beach was gorgeous and the service was seamless. Fantastic location, every other resort was within walking distance, Sheraton, Hyatt etc. Snorkelling at Black Rock is a must, Whalers Village is right nextdoor with restaurants, shops and ABC store (where you can buy all your essentials at normal prices). Take the free shuttle bus in to Lahaina it's well worth it, plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from. We also did an island tour which was worth doing if you don't feel confident hiring a car. We dined at Tropica and our server John (from Virginia) was an absolute delight ... the food was modern and uncomplicated. We chose not to eat breakfast at the Hotel as we wanted to do our own thing. ADDED TIPS: We had dinner in Lahaina at David Paul's Grill ... if you are a foodie, you will appreicate the entire experience - unique flavours, original cocktails and excellent service.

There are a good deal of other desirable hotels on this side of Maui - we will be looking more at these for a future visit. See our thoughts below. Pros: The grounds are lovely - nice pools (though nothing special like a river run or elaborate water slide for thrill-seeking kids), flowers, trees, swans etc. The beach just outside the hotel is also very nice - clean sand, nice water, but a lot of traffic and tourist development. The staff and service they offered, at the front desk, at the concierge, the quick service line on the telephone (always answered promptly and in a friendly, helpful manner, and the valet), was terrific - the staff deserve high commendations for their warm, helpful disposition. Negatives: Rooms out of date, furniture damaged, dust covered furniture, tiles on floor broken, walls dirty. All we had to do is slide a lamp over to see that the tables are not adequately dusted - hard to get at areas are even worse. The fountains outside are ludicrously loud and will keep you awake all night, as will the arguing of neighbouring guests through the paper-thin walls of the adjacent rooms. Plan to enjoy the lanei? Be preparing to inhale cigarette smoke as smokers are allowed to smoke outside their rooms here and the balconies are right next to one another. The elevators were under repair more often than not, but this is not a big deal, it is more the condition of the rooms and noise (difficulty sleeping) that led to our disappointment. Important - the Westin aspires to \"resort\" status but they charge their patrons for the \"rental\" of plastic loungers on the beach. We have travelled extensively and have never seen this. Want a seat? Be prepared to pull out your wallet (or your room number) - otherwise loungers are shackled. A Side Note: We had a negative experience at the Spa here owing to the behaviour of one of the staff members. The spa is already dated, nothing special, with plain, barren cubicle-type rooms and little in the way of outdoor treatments. While it is a treat to go to a spa on any occasion, we would not recommend the spa at the Westin due to the lack of atmosphere, and more importantly, the staff, which, in the case of our therapist, was outright rude, insulting, and not at all interesting in trying to accommodate our needs. Note that we did visit the Salon and we were happy with the staff there who were friendly, good-humored and keen (and well able) to make a good impression on customers.

The gardens are very pretty, the pools and walk ways are very nice with the ocean back drop. However the hot tub was a very high temp and extremely small. My 20 something age children told me at night it was quite crowded and awkwardly cozy in the evenings. The rooms seemed very drab and rather dated. The sink area in our room was very small, although it was larger in our kids mountain view rooms. I was disappointed in the quality of the sheets used in our Garden View room. The sheets had a scent that was not a clean and smell but a rather stale mildew smell to them. With the gardens, pools and location I would have given it a 4 star except twice in a row we have been given sheets that had stains on them. Big GROSS in my book. The final thing that dropped them to a 3 is the noisy elevator. Our room was right across from the elevators and they ding loudly when ever it passes our floor.

And when needing something from the front desk like the complimentary late check out, so we could go ziplining on our last day, it was never a problem or a hassle! We were given a free upgrade to ocean view room and there was a bottle of chamange in our room upon check in to celebrate our anniversary. We did have to wait two days and move rooms to get an ocean front since the hotel was sold out due to weddings for 11-11-11, but the hotel made it very easy for us and it wasn't a big deal. So thank you to Kain and Joven at the front desk you help ensured our stay was relaxing. This was our first trip without children and we enjoyed the quiet of the adult pool but the pools were never too loud and there were lots of families enjoying them. As for the rooms. We were in the ocean view tower which is what people call the older tower. It was nice and clean (in both rooms we were in). They are a typical Westin hotel room with comfortable beds and nice ammenities. Our room was always cleaned and the cleaning staff never woke us up! We were in a room on the 10th floor that had amazing mountain views for the first 2 days and my only issue was that is was right next to the elevator so I could hear the dinging like it was in my room (Room 1020 Ocean View tower) when we got moved to the Ocean view room (Room 917) with the great king bed the view was out of this world (it is worth paying for the upgade if you have to)! There is nothing special about this room and yes if you go over the room and tower with a microscopic eye then you will see paintchips and such but nothing that was unacceptable in my mind and I am easily offended! So if your looking for the Four Seasons then I suggest staying at the Four Season (I think there is one on the island) but if your in Hawaai and your hanging out in your room then your doing something WRONG! Also thanks to Sara a concierge for loaning us her own personal CD for the road to Hana! Saved us some much need $$$ since we left a lot of it on the island!

We were booked for a garden view room in the main part of the hotel that's above the lobby, and we were not happy with it. It looked and smelled like a college dorm room, and had a horrible layout. The bathroom door blocked access to the bedroom, and there was a box fridge just thrown in the corner. The view was of the waterfalls and garden, which was fine. We complained and were upgraded to a deluxe ocean view. WOW, what a difference. You wouldn't know it was the same hotel. The room was renovated and modern. The view was amazing. We were happy from there on. As of October 2011, the hotel informed me they are starting to renovate that smaller tower in 2012. So keep your fingers crossed. The pool choices are endless. They even have an adult pool for those of us who don't want to listen to screaming kids all day. And there was even a poolside bar at the adult pool. Jackpot! The beach was small, as the tide has washed away a lot of their sand. But there is still plenty of room to not have to be close to other people. They rent a pair of wood chairs and an umbrella for $30 a day, or you can get the more comfortable wide recliner chairs for $10 each a day. We did that and we were much happier. I think the people on the wood chairs were jealous. We spent an afternoon at the spa, and that was amazing. It's blows away any spa you've ever been to. You will pay for it though, as with anything on the island. Location is excellent, only 2 minutes from Lahaina. You are 45 min from the airport, but everything is. There is a one lane highway all the way to the hotel, but the drive is spectacular. We took 100 photos just on the drive from the airport to the hotel to check in. The hotel is directly next to the whalers village, which has a handful of restaurants. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, and the buffet is the way to go. If you order a la carte, then you are going to spend more than just doing the buffet. Don't pay any companies to take you on a snorkel trip. Walk yourselves down the beach about 300 yards and snorkel at Black Rock in front of the Sheraton. It's free, and the best snorkeling you will find on the island. The water is calm, because the giant rock blocks the big waves. My wife was struggling to swim when we did a test run in front of the hotel. We saw sea turtles and lots of fish. There is a great natural reef over there. Rent a Jeep or convertible and don't bother valeting. They have free self parking that you are already paying for in your \"resort fee\". For internet, connect to the business center or lobby wireless, and don't bother paying for the \"faster\" room internet. They limit the speed on the \"free wifi\" for the rooms. It was sad how slow it was. I connected to the business center from the 9th floor and got 7MB down and 1MB up. The housekeeping staff was very good at their jobs. We had a very sweet lady on the 9th floor that kept our room immaculate. We did our best to keep it organized, and she did such a great job. Don't forget to tip your housekeeping if you are happy with their services. That goes for any staff on property. They are working hard to keep you happy. The rest of the hotel staff really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The concierge was so helpful. We got some great tricks and tips from them. If you intend to do any amount of driving on the island, go to the GyPSy Guide stand in Lahaina and rent the GPS unit they have. Google it to find them. It tracks where you are and gives you history, tips, places to see, places to avoid, and basically gives you a tour of the entire island based on where YOU want to go. You can rent by the day or week, i believe. We only got it for one day towards the end of our stay, and I wish I had it the whole week. It was great. Eliminates the need for any maps or books about the island. We brought $100 worth of books with us to Hana, and we didn't open one of them, because the GPS guide knew it all. It told us which waterfalls weren't that impressive, and where we could pull off. It let both of us keep our eyes on all the sites.

The hotel has no business center. They placed 2 computers in a narrow alcove that is part of an outdoor caf\u00c3\u00a9. The area they were in is cramped and has little ventilation.

When I read on trip advisor about the rennovations being done at the Hyatt (five days before our stay) we immediately called our wonderful travel consultant, Maui Kay (mauikay.com) who incidentally lives on Maui, and she was able to get us into the Westin. We were there from Oct. 28th to Nov. 3rd. We had a room on the 9th floor of the Beach Tower. It was a large room with a large bathroom. Our view was that of the pool area and grounds and the ocean. We were very happy with our room location. The decor was not my style, however, and it was not very Hawaiian looking. The dresser was wood with a glass top. The carpeting was old and bubbling. The patio chairs were worn and uncomfortable, but I could get past all that since the view was so nice. The bedding was comfy and they give you plenty of pillows. Our biggest complaint would be the noise people made when opening their sliding door to the balcony. Some days it started at 6 a.m. Our package included the breakfast buffet each day. We took advantage of having a good meal at the start of the day, a small snack for lunch, then a dinner. The breakfast buffet was usually the same each day and there was a chef who would make you eggs of your choice. We chose to eat ocean side each morning, which ended up being in the Tropica Restaurant. The view, the breeze, the setting.....ahhh, a must do! If you don't have the buffet you can order off the menu. There is also a cafe in the lobby area where you can purchase coffee, bagels, pastries, yogurt, and cereal. The grounds of the resort are beautiful. There are several waterfalls, flamingo's in the lobby pond, five pools, one being adults only, and a tiki bar. There is also a bar at the Ono Grill and at the Tropica Restaurant. We ate lunch one day at the Ono Grill. The food was good. The sandwiches we ordered came with fries or Maui Chips and cost around $12 a dish. Drinks not bought during happy hour could cost you eight dollars up to fourteen. A Mai Tai was $11. Take advantage of the happy hours. As far as parking, we only had to valet one night, and it was probably a luau night. We were not charged, but did tip the guy when he brought our car around the next day. We did not attend the luau there, but we viewed the area where it takes place. It is a small area and there are 20 or so round tables of eight, a stage, and in the back, an area where the buffet is served. We only encountered one employee who was unsmiling, otherwise everyone seemed helpful and friendly. At the pool area you do need to wear a wristband and you have to return your towels before 5p.m. or they will charge you $25.00. There is a stand near the pool that sells smoothies, shaved ice, popcorn, hot dogs, chips and other snacks. They also have waitresses who will bring you food or drinks. There are cabanas to rent in the pool areas or chairs with umbrellas by the beach. The beach chairs cost $35 to rent (you get two) and there is a limited amount. Get down to the pool area early to reserve them as they go fast, or reserve them before you get to Maui. Since alcohol isn't allowed on the beach, they do not have waitresses who come down to the beach. At least not during our stay. On arrival you get a Westin bag and a coupon for a free coffee mug at the cafe. Also a free 4x6 photo but they take more pictures in hopes that you buy them. We didn't bother with the photo. There are lots of scenic views on the grounds that allow for several photo opportunities. We had no problem waiting for an elevator, but we were also there during off season. The hotel was maybe 60% occupied. We never waited in a line for the buffet or at any of the restaurants we tried. There were not many children at the resort either. Another benefit of staying during off season is being able to get a late check-out, or if you're really lucky like we were, the use of a room until 4p.m. for no charge if you have a late flight. There are a few manned activity and tour desks in the lobby and while they are convenient, be advised that the rates they quote are higher than you might pay booking the activity or tour on your own or with a coupon. Or better yet, call Maui Kay and she'll take care of you! The Westin is right next to Whaler's Village, the Hula Grill and Lelani's. We saw several rainbows over the mountains behind the resort. Even the mountain view is gorgeous.

Having said that, we stayed 6 nights at end of October and had a nice time. The Ocean Tower rooms are older and smaller than the Beach Tower. Spend the extra money and get Beach Tower, Ocean View.

We were scheduled to spend five nights on Maui.

We were so thankful to spend our final three nights of the honeymoon at the Westin. Lucky for us, the Westin was able to accept our reservation without any prior notice the same day that we checked out of the other property. We waited for a few hours, but a beatiful ocean view, king size room became available for us. For being ocean view, this was pretty much ocean front. Our room faced the ocean and looked out over the gorgeous pool area. The view was about 75% ocean/beach/pool, and the other 25% looked out over Whaler's Village. The room was spacious, clean, and modern, and the bed was the best part. It was so comfortable, we wanted to bring it home with us! The bathroom area was large enough for both of us to be getting ready at the same time, and we really enjoyed the extra counter space and bar above the mini fridge and safe. Within 10 minutes of us being up in the room, there was a knock on the door. To our surprise, we were treated to a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice with two champagne flutes. We were pleasantly surprised since the hotel didn't even know about us until a few hours prior. They really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special on our honeymoon even though it was totally a last minute booking. The pool area (five pools in all) was just beautiful. Tons of tropical landscaping, and plenty of waterfalls. We appreciated the \"adults only\" pool, and we never had an issue finding chairs. We particularly enjoyed the hidden whirlpool area tucked away in a cave that connects two of the pools. It was a private area, and we were the only two in that area of the the pool at night. The staff is friendly and accomodating, and we really liked the valets. We only used the valet parking one night. When the self-park lot is full, your car will be parked by the valet without having to pay for valet. Even when we didn't use valet, they were so kind.

The location of the hotel is perfect. There is plenty of sandy beach area along the ocean, and it's right next door to Whaler's Village. Such a short walk to dining and shopping! We did have dinner at Tropica, the resort's restaurant, and felt it was a bit overpriced. However, we received a complimentary dessert since our reservation for dinner was booked through the hotel concierge and she gave us a coupon.

The ironing board was in a special cabinet built for this purpose in the bathroom! The Westin Maui, like some other resort properties, banks it reputation on opulence throughout the hotel - other than the guest rooms. We found the grounds pleasant and the hotel staff very helpful. However, when we went down to the pool area and asked for beach towels, we were advised we had to wear wristbands \"for security purposes.\" I advised the young man that I no longer went to summer camp and also studiously avoided all-inclusive resorts where wrist bands were required. I did remove the wrist band, as did several other guests, and was not bothered (there were no \"security\" staff checking for these). This is an extremely strange requirement, given that the Westin is virtually inacessible to non-guests. Parking is controlled and it's a fair hike along the beach from anywhere else.

The location was perfect in the middle of Kaanapali, near Lahaina where there is a little more going on. When you walk in, you are met with the waterfall and flamingos and it's all open-air.. just beautiful! The pool area is amazing with a hoop court, volleyball court, children's waterslide and an adult waterslide. Maui is expensive and eating at the Westin is costly. You will have to get in your car to stop by a McD's or Taco Bell for a cheap lunch, but we expected this. We did order the Kahlua Pork Nachos one night at Ono Grill and have to say that it was delicious! We booked a mountain/golf view room and we asked for a higher floor, which they gave us and our view was beautiful. I'm sure the ocean view was better, but our view was still very nice. We checked in very early; our flight got in at about 10am and despite the rep at the front desk commenting \"you're early\", he still was able to get us into a room and was able to meet my preferences. We were not bothered by car alarms going off in the parking lot below us as other reviewers commented (the parking lot is on the mtn/golf side). The room was nice. I'm not sure why some ppl say they are outdated, it had dark wood furniture, a flat screen TV, and a very comfortable bed. Maybe it's the popcorn ceilings?! hehe I guess it could use a little bit of cosmetic work, especially in the restrooms. The bathrooms weren't anything to rave about....a toilet and a shower. Our room was cleaned every day, but just for appearance sake, the bathrooms could use more attention for sure. When we arrived, there was one main elevator out of service for at least 2-3 days, but I later heard that they are remodeling, not to mention, I read constant complaints regarding the elevators, so I was not surprised. Not a major complaint, but it could be an inconvenience for most. We learned to just go to the other elevators on either end and those were quicker. And, we just had to remember that we were on vacation and not in a hurry, so just relax! My husband said it would be great if they added a lazy river since the pool area is so large and connecting. But, we walked around to nearby resorts and still thought the Westin's pool area was better! Also, a suggestion.... play some island music at the pool area! It would add to the ambiance... may even \"encourage\" more drink purchases. ;-) During this trip, we opted not to do a luau, which was fine. We got lucky and found a spot where we could actually view the dancers at the luau above the stage so that was great! In reading even the most recent hotel reviews on here, I could see how others may have had a bad experience with rude staff or unclean rooms, because there was some staff who never smiled. They could use some improvement in their customer service skills, but luckily, we didn't encounter anyone blatantly rude.. lol. Luckily, we did not have a bad experience here!! And, surprisingly, it was not over crowded when we went. There were times, we wished there were a little bit more people there, but it was fine. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the Westin Maui and would definitely return.

We have stayed at Starwood Resorts (Westin and Sheraton) a few times, but this was the least pleasant experience. First, when we arrived at check-in time. after 3:00pm we were told that our room was not ready and to come back later. Literally, 2.5 hours later, our room was still not ready and it seemed as if the front desk person was being inconvenienced to provide a room. She was inconsiderate and did not seem sympathetic that we had a child who was extremely tired from the long flight. Also, several times when we were in the line for the front desk there was only one person who seemed to be working with guests although there were others who were at the front, but not acknowledging that there were people waiting for assistance. Second, the room was outdated and dirty, with dust all over the fixtures, desk, phone and crumbs on the floor. Good thing I had brought my own Lysol wipes to clean. The bathroom was okay, but our toilet had problems (running constantly) and it sounded like a wind tunnel in the commode area. Third, I agree with other reviews that the lines for coffee and pastries was at least 10 minutes every day and the servers were not smiling nor attentive. I often waited at least 2-3 minutes to be acknowledged at the counter. Fourth, the self-parking was often crowded and we were concerned that the parking spaces were too close together and our daughter and myself had to exit the car prior to parking in the tight spaces. Also, twice cars were parked behind us and we had to alert the valet to move the car so we could leave. Fifth, the food was outrageously expensive. Yes, I know it's Hawaii, but why would I pay $5 dollars for a small OJ that I can get at Safeway (down the street) for less than $2. Same with other food items: $5 for a muffin, $8 for a breakfast sandwich, $8 for a fruit smoothie. Sixth, the internet (both wireless and room) was terrible. We had little signal and were often having to reboot our respective devices to reconnect. My husband had to sit down near the front desk to get even close to a constant signal. This service was also supposed to be part of the $25 dollar resort fee. Last, we paid $25 dollars a day for 2 small bottles of water, self-parking and who knows what else -- definitely not worth that amount and often less at other hotels. There were two high points, one of our servers at the Ono Bar & Grill was very friendly during our first day and sympathized with our wait for a room.

We received complimentary champagne (requested for our anniversary). Rooms are given either mountain view or ocean view. If you get a mountain view room, try to get one on one of the upper floors as we did (the view is gorgeous up high, just call in advance to request this). The parking was hassle-free. The gym was clean, had various types of cardio machines that are state of the art, and the weight machines are all you need to get a good workout in. The spa is $25/day (unless you get a treatment, which are expensive but appropriately priced for a high-end hotel). The hotel is beachfront, so there's no drive or long walk needed to go into the water. The beach itself is not packed by any means, the water is clear and warm. Good place for snorkeling (Black Rock), and there are many activities that you can book through the hotel (AmEx). If the salt water isn't your thing, the multiple pools are amazing as well. There's even a division between adult pools and children's pools, which makes it nice for those of us who are looking for a quiet and relaxing place to sunbathe. The guests are mostly couples, and young families. The standard room is decently sized (~250sq ft, not counting the vanity area and bathroom), w flat screen TV, sleek furniture and sizeable armoire, marble countertops, a safe, a minifridge, balcony with a couple chairs and a table (great for drinking your morning coffee), free wifi, and a blowdrier... Ray (the concierge), Steve (scuba instructor/dive master), and Virginia Galenato (our cleaning lady) are top of the line people and are best at what they do. We went to the lu'au on the premises, which was fun, although the meal layout was a bit awkward... they bring one big plate of food that you have to share/ration amongst yourselves at the table (~9 people at each table). The resort is also closely located to the Lahaina strip, where you'll find many shops, boutiques, restaurants, etc. The down sides- half of the elevators were down at any given time, and there's no shuttle service to/from our airport (kahului).

This was a good date to choose because the weather was great and the resort did not have the crowds others have written about. When we pulled up to the resort, we could tell it was a mega resort ( which we like) and could also see that the beach tower looks a little out dated from the outside. As others have mentioned, the lobby/resort area is very impressive and has the WOW factor we all want. We booked our stay through Costco which I highly suggest ( all kinds of extra perks/freebies). After mucg debate, I called Costco and payed for the upgraded toom to Oceanview. This is a must!!! You will be disappointed with there Mountian View rooms. While waiting for our car each day, seeing the mountain view rooms, my wife and I commented how awful the view was. Absolutely without hesitation get the resort/ocean view room and request the Beach tower. It is much newer. Also request away from the elevators and above the 4th floor to get better view and not hear the noisy elevators. The beds are awesome here!! we slept great. The rooms are nothing fancy, but honestly you spend more time enjoying Maui than the rooms. We did have to move rooms because the first rooms was very dirty and did not have the view we had paid for. The resort moved us to a great room on the 5th floor Beach tower. Pools are very fun and relaxing. If you do have kids though, there wlll be no access to a jacuzzi for you on your trip. The only jacuzzi is at the adult pool. Take advantage of happy hours for food/dring at both the resort and Whalers village. There is Martini hour at Tropica and happy hour at Ono's. I also suggest the happy hour next door at Leilani's restaurant. This is a great way to keep cost down. As everyone else suggested, stock up on snacks for the room at ABC store in Whalers Village right next to resort. My wife and I both enjoyed great massages at the resort, look on the website as they have specials every month. You must take time to snorkel at Black Rock, it is fantastic. Saw turtles and spotted Eagle Rays. The Gemeni sail boat the resort is great too. Staff is awesome. Book on their website, it is cheaper than booking at the resort itself. We did the sunset cruise which was relaxing.

Check in went well, they were very friendly but the front desk did consistanly have a line of several guests. The wait was never more than 5 minutes or so, so I didn't mind too much. The room was not as nice as other Westins we have stayed in but it wasn't bad either. Kind of small and maybe a tad outdated, but they did have the Heavenly beds and shower and that was really all we used it for anyway. The food & beverage and the staff were great. From the first drink we had at the Ono, we fell in love with the staff there. We looked forward to seeing all the bartenders daily (especially Shannon & Junior!). We had lunch and dinner there several times and I still dream about the pork sliders! We also had the breakfast buffet one morning, although it was pricy, we were not there to pinch pennies so I would reccomend trying the buffet at least once. Tropica was hands down the best dinner we had on the island. We ate there twice and watched the sunset during dinner and the food and the view were AMAZING! Again, you must eat there at least once as well. The beach was great, we rented paddleboards several times and did some snorkeling in front of the Westin and a lot down at Black Rock (the Sheraton). The erosion on the beach did not bother us at all but we are from Florida so we are used to all kind of beaches. The ocean water was refreshing, we never felt cold in the ocean but the pool was COLD! Maybe it's just my Florida blood but I could not stay in there more than 5 mintues without having a few drinks first LOL! We did, still, make it a point to go down the slide at least once a day. I enjoyed the spa one day which was very, very nice. Beautiful spa, with great monthly specials. The location was great we loved walking to Whaler's Village and to hang out at the Sheraton. We rented a car and we very, very thankful we did. You need a car to get around Maui. But, even though we were there during \"off season\" the parking got full just about every night.

Overall it's an attractive property and we got a reasonable room rate with their promotions (about $350/night), however between the noise issues and feeling like you are being nickel-and-dimed at every turn, we will not be staying here a 3rd time. Pros: -Friendly staff -They upgraded us from a standard ocean view room to a deluxe ocean view room when we checked-in (larger room/closer to the ocean) -Good sized lanai -The rooms are nicely furnished and clean -The property is beautiful and close to the beach, shopping and restaurants -Within walking distance to Black Rock (great place to snorkel) -We love to occasionally splurge on room service and their food is pretty good -One of their pools is for adults only -Convenient jacks so we could hook-up our iPod and listen to music thru our TV Cons: -The biggest reason I won't return is that every night from 5 PM to 9 PM they have LOUD live music in the restaurant. Call me crazy, but when I go on a beach vacation I want to listen to the waves crashing on the sand, not some guy putting his personal spin on Margaritaville. Even with the sliding glass door closed and the TV on in our 7th story room, we could still hear the music. Perhaps if we'd stayed in the Ocean Tower, which is further away from the restaurant, the music wouldn't have been so loud. Of course then we also would have been further away from the ocean... -You have to wear a wristband when hanging out by the pool. I understand and appreciate that they only want hotel guests using the pool and hanging out in the lounge chairs, but why can't they just determine this by the pool towels? They already have a system in place where you have to check-out and return the towels using your name and room number. -There were very few and sometimes no staff to take food/drink orders by the pool. -The pool waterfalls are lovely, but loud; especially at 5 AM when I was trying to sleep and my husband was going back and forth from the lanai to the coffeemaker. -The room does not come with a DVD player and if you'd like to rent a movie in-room it costs $17.99 for new releases. Yes, $17.99! -The $25/day resort fee includes basic internet, which is very slow. If you want to upgrade, it is an additional $9.99/day and even that is still extremely slow. -The pools are really cold. After being on the beach all day I like to just hang out and relax in the pool for a while. I'm sorry, but freezing cold water is not relaxing. -Uncomfortable chairs on the lanai.

I got there early for check in and they said my room wasn't ready, so they checked me in and said they'd call me when my room was ready. We waited around the hotel and even went to the Whaler's village, but even at 1:30pm, our room wasn't ready. I was beginning to worry that the cold food we had in our insulated bag was going to go bad (we stayed 5 nights prior at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Villas where we had a full fridge). I asked the bell hop and asked if they can put some stuff in the fridge and they were so helpful!!!!!! After that we went to Kuhului to run some errands and in the meantime, hotel called and said our room was ready. When we got to our room, I was so regretting booking two hotels for our 10 night trip and wished I just stayed at the Villas. Our room (ocean view in the Ocean tower) was pretty small, the carpets looked like it needed to be replaced and so did the wall paper. As someone mentioned earlier, I thought this should have called a Sheraton or better yet a Four Points! However, as we settled in and spent the 5 nights, I walked away thinking it wasn't as bad as I first thought. Here are some of the good highlights: - Heavenly shower! - oh how I missed you!!! Hotel gives you an option to not have both shower heads going to conserve water, but I'm on vacation and one of the reasons I love Westins is because of the heavenly shower! - Recycling bin in each room - just because I don't want to conserve water during my showers doesn't mean I don't think we should recycle during vacation. Each room has a recycling bin, so I thought that was convenient. - Lobby area - The lobby and the grounds of this hotel is really nice. From the water falls, to the flamingos, black swan, koi fish, parrots, it is all very nice - Decent pools - Pools were nice and some of them connected through a cave sort of thing with waterfalls -Tropica restaurant - I'll have a separate review for this restaurant (the good and bad), but I did like having a restaurant ocean front. They also have a early bird and late bird dinner specials which I thought made things a little bit affordable. (since I have two kids, we normally ate early anyway) - Location - Location is kind of nice since it's it's right next to Whaler's village and basically in hotel row where you can walk to other hotels through the beach front sidewalks. - Shuttle service - We used this to go to the Sheraton hotel which is like 2 hotels down, but with 2 little ones, we took the shuttle. I heard there is great snorkeling on the beach near Sheraton. However, with two kids, we didn't snorkel, however, we did see 3 turtles within a couple of feet from us standing in the water, it was pretty amazing. Here are some of the stuff I didn't like as much - This place needs major room renovations - the grounds are really nice, but the rooms do need to be re-done and updated. Also the walls are really thin and you can hear the conversations your next door neighbor is having. I kind of felt bad for our neighbors because I had moments where my boys were acting up. - Beach - the beach is not as great as I had hoped. it's actually really short (from the sidewalk to the water) due to eroding. - It's a bit crowded and a little commercialized - Although the grounds are great, there are vendors on the grounds and I feel like too much is going on. I don't feel like it's truly a getaway peaceful resort. However, I think this place will be great for singles since there seems to be a lot going on and lot of people. - Parking - I think many people mentioned this. I went in September when it's not supposed to be even that busy, but it WAS THAT busy! Most nights we were not able to find parking and they had to valet it for us (which is technically free if there is no parking space, but we tipped all the time, so that kind of adds up!) And as I mentioned being crowded with no parking space, it's overall looked like it was a very full hotel as I saw bunch of rooms facing the parking lot (even on the 2nd floor overlooking the valet area) all occupied. I think I will most likely stay at the Westin Villas when returning to Maui, but if I couldn't get it, I can say I would stay at the place. P.S.

The hotel is gigantic, the grounds are impeccable, the pool is everything you imagine from the pictures and more, and the beach is right out the back door.

The lush vegetation, flamingos, swan, birds and fish add to the ambience of the hotel. The waterfalls and numerous swimming pools create an atmosphere to relax and unwind. You don't have to constantly be on the run while on vacation; it is pleasant just to sit at the hotel and relax. Staff is very nice and helpful; however, don't expect great service from most of the concierge, who feel they are doing you a favor by answering questions. They also push attending a timeshare presentation, which we completed, but once they get their commission they are no longer as helpful or friendly. The hotel has a great buffet and there are three persons in particular who make us feel welcome and valued as a guest in the hotel; these persons are Nerio, Tami Mello and Alaine; they provide great, friendly service which makes a difference and encourages us to come back every year. The buffet is constantly being replenished with fresh items. My only suggestion regarding the buffet is to add a new dish every couple of days; after being at the hotel for two weeks and eating a buffet breakfast every day, it would make a big difference to have a little more variety. We also ate at the Tropica restaurant. The restaurant has greatly improved, with more variety and tasteful choices. Becky is an excellent server, who is friendly and attentive. John Hernandez who is a food runner is especially nice and friendly and conveys the Aloha spirit; he will do whatever it takes to make your dining more enjoyable. He stated that he was raised to respect people and to treat guests at the hotel as if they were part of his family. We also had a great housekeeper, who throughly cleaned our room and was always cheerful and friendly every time we saw her. Her name is Leonara C. and she made us feel welcome and appreciated to be a guest at the hotel. The hotel is undergoing renovation, new paint, new large bird cages for the parrots and updated elevator interiors. We were also told that the rooms will be renovated in the near future. The rooms are clean, however, they could use new carpeting and updated bathrooms. The shower contains old style shower heads (two of them) which waste water; I would prefer the new rain shower type which are becoming prevalent in other hotels.

In short, I found the staff to be very accommodating, but you need to be comfortable spending your vacation around a LOT of other people. If you like peace and quiet, the Westin (and Ka'anapali) is not for you. I should preface my remarks by saying that, before arriving at this hotel, I spent 7 days in Wailea, which I found to be a much quieter part of the island. The Westin--and all of Ka'anapali for that matter--has a lot more people hanging around. My wife kept saying that she felt like she was in Vegas: there was just too much activity. Based on my stay, I can see two reasons why someone should choose to stay here. First, after the Sheraton, it has the best beach access of all the local hotels on the strand. (However, even this is relative. The beach quickly drops off and parts of it are pretty rocky, so it's difficult to play in the waves.) The second reason to stay here is the close proximity to Whaler's Village, which is an upscale shopping mall. The room itself was a little dated and impersonal, and I expected something a little larger for the price that I paid. The bath/toilet area was quite dark, and there was mildew around the tub. I also think it's funny that Westin crams their trademark double showerhead into a dated and small shower/tub combo. They're going for luxury, but the whole thing ends up looking stupid and tacky. I did appreciate having a fridge in the room. The pool area was nice, but the deck chairs are packed in pretty tight, and it was difficult to find shade. (Shaded cabanas were available for an extra fee.) Speaking of fees, getting two chairs and an umbrella at the beach went for $36/day, which seemed a little unreasonable to me, especially given the high price of the rooms and the added resort fee. I've had good experiences with the Westin brand in the past, but this stay was disappointing.

Waterfalls, an awesome slide that even mom had to go down several times, grattos with massive whirlpools, an adult section to the pool with jacuzzi and a bar. Locationwise, this hotel is centeral to everything. A great outdoor mall is right next door with wonderful restaurants and stores that are unique to Hawaii and some that are chain stores, but not common to the east side of the U.S. If you rent a car, getting anywhere from the Westin is easy and worth it because driving anywhere in Maui is worth the time just for the views. A car is not necessary if you like to shop, however, the Westin has a great shuttle that goes to most of the places you could want to go. It is hard to want to leave the property so you have to force yourself to get out. The stores in the hotel have great things to buy and satisfy any cravings or sundrie needs. The restaurants on the property are very good too and they have the best breakfast buffet ever... fresh, delicious food, and I consider myself a \"foodie.\" As far as fun things to do, location, again, works for you. We took a catamaran ride to a great place to snorkle. The ride there was as fun as the snorkling. The Gemini catamaran is right at the hotel beach. People come from all over Maui to take this excursion and it is right outside the hotel. If you want to para-sail, again, the location is right at the beach outside the hotel and it is a blast.

They were quick to grab my stuff and place it in my room which was already waiting for us; a welcomed surprise with a jetlagged toddler especially considering we were a bit earlier than normal check-in time. Upon walking in we were greeted by an impressive walterfall, live flamingos, large koi swimming in grand pools and a traditional Hawaiian shell lei/\"Aloha\" by the staff. After a quick check-in, we headed up stairs to our room which was nicely appointed with 2 beds, small refrigerator, all the bells and whistles. The room had mountain views overlooking the golf course, Surgar Cane Train and to my surprise also offered a peek of the ocean. The grounds of the hotel were thoughtfully laid out with attention given to an \"Adults-Only\" pool/bar complimented by plenty of space for kids and families to play without being disruptive to honeymooners, etc. There are several waterfalls withon the pools, a large slide for the big kids/adults and a little shoot for the keiki. My daughter went down the slide at least 100 times. By far the highlight of her trip (great for me because it was free). Other free perks included feeding Harvey the black swan, catching a quick peek at the luau show and dancing to the music til she pooped out. Also, because she is 3 and under, she ate for free. We both got the best 5 nights of sleep I can remember due to the lush beds...ah the beds! I was actually a little sad to sleep in my own bed. Happy to shower at home but miss the beds! NOTE: If you like a firm pillow, call guest services. There are several activties offered at the hotel but they don't push them on you. In fact, so much that I overlooked the offer for a free 4x6 taken by their professional photog...heard about that by my brother. There are kid-friendly, cheap eats at the poolside eateries and pristine beaches in front of the hotel. Safe swimming for my daughter and fun snorkeling for me were just a quick 10 minute stroll to Black Rock.

I would first like to send out my highest of compliments to the staff at this resort, and more specifically to my wedding coordinator Bonnie Stolp. During the year leading up to our wedding Bonnie tirelessly answered the hundreds of questions I sent her way. Her suggestions and recommendations for everything from music to photographers were absolute perfection. The level of organization and professionalism executed by Bonnie and all other staff members working at our wedding ensured that our special day was absolute perfection. Us girls started our day at the Heavenly Spa where the staff were fun, upbeat and accommodating. They did a fantastic job on my makeup which held up for the entire celebration which isn't an easy achievement in the warm tropical weather Maui has to offer. Following the spa we continued our wedding preparations up in the Halawai Lounge that we had reserved specifically for us girls (I highly recommend any bridal party rent this room as it gives tons of space to get ready in with a spectacular view of the entire resort, beach and mountains). Our wedding was presided over by the Reverend Pia Aluli who, with his gentle nature, delivered a beautiful ceremony that we will never forget. Our photographer, Caprice Nicole, captured our special day in the most beautiful pictures without ever overtaking any part of the celebration, allowing us to maintain the fun and relaxing atmosphere that we had strived for on our wedding day. Bonnie and her staff set up the ceremony and dinner venues so beautifully that it exceeded all expectations. The dinner was exceptionally delicious and received rave reviews from all of our guests. Following the buffet, us and our 47 guests enjoyed a fantastic chocolate fondue for dessert topped up by a delicious 3 tier wedding cake that was so good that it disappeared completely before the night was out! Following the toasts, we moved into an indoor venue on the property where the DJ (another recommendation of Bonnie's) kept everyone on the dance floor into the morning hours. He was a ton of fun and entertained every request that was made! For all couples interested in getting married on the island of Maui, my husband and I highly recommend the Westin Maui Resort and Spa.

The Villas property is literally about a mile or two north of the Resort and Spa, sharing the same beach but a different part of it. Having stayed at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas first, unfortunately all the other properties we stayed at afterwards were not as good - the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas was our best hotel experience in Hawaii. We decided to stay one night at the Westin Maui Resort & Spa just so the kids could enjoy the pseudo water park with slides. Unfortunately, there is really only one genuine slide at the Westin Maui Resort and Spa and for some reason we were thinking there are several. There is a second smaller slide about 10 to 12 feet long but more for the baby set. The primary slide is pretty good for kids and adults. There are two hot tubs but kids are not allowed in them much to the sadness of my kids! The pool area is very busy and loud which is not a problem for us because we live in a world of loud with three boys ages 8, 8 and 11. If you are a couple looking for a quiet time or prefer not to be around kids - this is not the property for you, We found the overall layout of the resort to be confining - felt small relative to the number of people there. The resort rooms surround the pool area on three sides, the fourth side opens to the beach and ocean, The pool area is the center and where most of the activity is. The first room we were given felt like a cage - very small for a family of five or even four. But, again, we were spoiled by the large villas at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas. We asked for an upgrade and the resort was nice enough to give us a room a little bit larger. Both rooms were clean. The whole property was well maintained. The beach in front of the resort is nice, sandy bottom, but not the best for snorkeling. If you walk about a half mile up the beach (there is a sidewalk that goes along the beach)you can reach Black Rock, by the Sheraton, which offers decent snorkeling, as well as amazing cliff diving. You will also walk by a mall en-route to Black Rock which offers fast food dining options and shopping. There are several restaurants along this walk as well. All in all, we just felt like we were at a typical resort with small rooms and a nice pool area - but too many guests. We felt cramped and got the feeling the Westin tried to put as many rooms as possible in the resort, cramming them in with a pool area in the middle.

The beach outside the Westin was a lot nicer for swimming than the beach outside the hotel next door. One day we decided to snorkel and were just floating, not taking any effort to paddle. The current pulled us over to the beach next door and it was so rough! And the pools are absolutely glorious - with waterfalls, a hidden whirlpool and slides. My favorite was the adults pool which has a bar that can serve drinks right to the pool. The towel deck place sells inflatable tubes and mats and there is a pump to fill them up too. The hotel staff were very warm and welcoming. They knew we were celebrating an anniversary and sent us champagne to our room. Another day they gave us a box of chocolates. The people at the concierge desk were helpful in giving us directions and suggestions for activities. One of them even recommended we cancel a hike we booked because she said that we could do that on our own.

We generally like the Westin hotel chain and were hopeful for a good experience, but we were sadly disappointed. We reserved and were placed in a mountain view room, which is a lovely setting in itself. However, you can really enjoy the view too much while sitting in the plastic covered, deflated cushions available on the deck furniture. The table is dusty and the overall deck is old-fashioned, cast iron railings with stained cement floors. Back inside the room, we were treated to scratched and chipped furniture and thread-bare carpet. The bathroom is so small and dated; the door barely clears the toilet. The painted, plywood closet on the bathroom wall (intended to store the ironing board closet) is so classy. Of course, we didn't have need for the closet because we could never get the ironing board to collapse after use. And, the shower heads thrust the water with such force, they were anything but \"heavenly\" as advertised. When we first laid down after our six hour trip from the mainland, we immediately noticed dozens of miniscule ants crawling all over the pillows and bedding up near the headboard. We immediately called \"Service Express\" (which we couldn't get to work from the cordless phone) and they told us to leave the pillows in the hallway and they would replace them. We immediately vacated the room and walked around the property, which is admittedly beautiful. When we returned an hour later, we had new pillows and pillow cases. We never did see any more ants...must have been a bad load of laundry. The parking situation is worth a mention. The \"self-park\" option is included in the $25 a day \"resort fee,\" (which also includes wifi.) However, when we would return between 8:30 and 9:00 PM, the \"self-park\" was full. This required us to valet park \"at no additional charge.\" However, as decent travelers, we always tip the parking attendants who are extremely efficient and victims of this parking scheme. When we picked up our car the next morning or afternoon from the valet, they would hustle to get our vehicle, but we would have to wait and of course, tip. The parking situation is a pain to say the least and I wish the Westin management would address it so the customers who elect to \"self park\" can do so without having to tip throughout the week. We thoroughly enjoyed the pools, water slide, ample beach towel availability and on-site beach and snack shop. We had lunch a few days at the poolside restaurant Ono Bar and Grill. The access to Kaanapali Beach, Whaler's Village and Black Rock for snorkeling was a major factor in our completing our stay at the hotel.

This hotel is extremely large and I felt that it has perfected the art of nickel and diming its customers to death. Want a beach chair? Pay money. Want to park or use the internet? Resort fee. etc., etc. First, the pros: The beds are soft and the beach towels are surprisingly soft. The location has a decent view when you're standing on the beach. After all, you are on a beach. A couple of the staff were friendly. You can call to complain via 1-800 number at 6:00 AM. The cons that I encountered far exceeded the pros: Most importantly, all three of the rooms I checked in to had defects or noise issues. The first room was a mountain view. Mostly, I saw and heard the parking lot, including slamming of car doors and car alarms. The shower in that room barley functioned. The second room was a garden view (an upgrade for our dissatisfaction) and it smelled like moldy carpet. The carpet was pulling away from the door. The front desk attendant suggested that I simply, \"keep the door to the room open,\" to rid the room of the smell. He said they often have problems with humidity causing mold or mildew smells. The room feels damp and soggy. The third room, also a garden view, was also quite noisy. My husband and I elected to stay in the smelly room instead of the other noisy room. No other rooms were offered to us, possibly due to availability. We are canceling the remainder of our stay and transferring to another hotel. Additional things that were off-putting to me: The staff was rude or off putting most of the time. The food is overpriced for the relative quality, especially the breakfast. Parking is a nightmare after 6:00 PM. Lines to the front desk are long. Some elevators were out during our stay. Another thing that stands out is the aggressive sales pitches the concierges forced us through when we wanted to ask a question. Overall, the stay wasn't great. It isn't romantic and when you're here, you'll feel like you just stepped into an artificial environment.

We had an Ocean Front View room overlooking the pools with a beautiful view of the ocean. I loved sitting on the Lanai while I enjoyed my coffee in the morning. The pools were great, but somewhat crowded. In order to get a decent lounge chair by the pool I had to claim our spot by 7:30am before the pool was even open. I was dismayed to learn that everyone was claiming thier spot by leaving towels on the chairs so early in the morning. Even though the pools are closed after dark, there were children swimming in the pools which could be heard at 10pm from our 11th floor balcony. We stayed in a condo north of the Westin for the first week of our trip and decided to treat ourselves to 3 nights at the Westin. It was a major disappointment for the $459 per night we paid. I expected to walk into a plush room, but instead it was drab, the carpet was worn, wet and lumpy. My first impression was the feeling of being in a cheap hotel room until I looked outside and saw the view. That was my only compensation. Everything at the resort was over priced. Even though we paid a daily $25 resort fee we still had to pay for beach chairs and umbrellas at $35 per day. The self-parking lot was not large enough to accomodate all the guests. If you left to go sight-seeing when you returned there were no available parking spots which meant costly valet parking. Over all I think the Westin is over-priced and not a good value.

I can't say enough about what an outstanding experience it was. The hotel is tough to beat in the area when it comes to quality, value, and proximity to the beach, Black Rock, local snorkeling destinations, and shopping. The grounds were meticulously kept and pools provided both relaxation (quiet at the adult pool) and fun (at the main pool with water slides, volleyball, activities, etc.). This hotel really does have it all. But I have to say that, without question, it was the service that stood out for us. \"Exceptional\" doesn't seem to be an adequate word. The staff was accommodating to all of our needs, and made us feel right at home. We had some dietary restrictions heading into this trip, and we actually considered postponing our vacation as a result. I am so happy we didn't. The staff was so unbelievably accommodating that it turned our current inconvenience into a truly remarkable and memorable time. While there is no doubt there were many people who helped us out that we never met, we loved how invested the following people were into making us feel special and at home: John King: Thank you for coordinating this special culinary experience. You actually took time out of your own well deserved vacation to follow up with us and make sure ours was special. That is service at it's absolute finest! Michael Wong and Garret Fujieda: Thank you for following through with the amazing food and service that John had promised! Your crew is well run and performed flawlessly. Eric Waddell: Thank you for really making us feel at home during our stay! Your personal approach is unmistakably first class and represents you, the Tropica, and the Westin in the highest light. And on another note: your snorkeling location tip turned out to be our best snorkeling experience while on the island! We snorkeled with about 50 spinner dolphins jumping out of the water, giant schools of fish, Moray eels, Octopus, turtles, and on and on. Wow! Ikaika Manaku: What an incredible chef you are! Your creations, with such limited restrictions to play with, were simply amazing! I can't say enough about how impressed we were with you and your skills! The fact that you came out to meet with us every night while having thought out, and planned for, our dining experience ahead of each night made us feel like celebrities. Very special indeed, as are you. Jimmy (Exceptional server at Tropica): Your smile is undeniably infectious. Your service is first class, fitting of the highest establishments anywhere in the world!

We could sleep with our curtains open, slider open to hear the ocean and no one could see in our room. Also, they were doing some rennovations on our floor which concerned me, but we NEVER heard any noise, ever and the hotel was very good about it not affecting our stay. We were somewhat concerned as to a few less favorable reviews, however we found the staff to be fantastic. We absolutely love the Westin's beach area and pool area. They are beautiful, clean and never felt crowded. We had arranged to rent beach chairs and an umbrella for several days and met an employee by the name of Kurrent.

I would say that this hotel is great if you have kids, but perhaps would not be my first choice if I was coming to Maui for a honeymoon. Hotel was fully booked during our stay, but did not feel too crowded. Snorkeling down at Black Rock is fantastic and well worth it. We went to the Sheraton Luau and really enjoyed it. Food is average, but they were really good at moving things along and keeping everyone entertained. Golf in Maui is absolutely stunning. Beautiful holes, wind to challenge you and treacherous greens.

The breakfast buffet was good, but it did not change at all the entire week. The food at the resort was what you would expect, overpriced average food. The drinks were quite expensive, except for the happy hour specials. I would highly recommend the sunset cruise on the Gemini boat, the Road to Hana( Especially if you take the mountain road back around Kapalua), Going down to Lahainna for Dinner.

Nothing special, certainly nothing luxurious. In addition to the room, I called the Spa several times to make an appt, left messages, however, no one ever called me back. All of this could have been ok (I mean we were in Hawaii) but our room was on the 10th floor with an Oceanview (which of course we paid more for) we were literally in the middles of a CONSTRUCTION ZONE. RIght next to our room was MAJOR Construction, hammering, drilling, walls were coming down, etc. The Hotel Manager was completely non accommodating to me and only offered to move us to a different room (twin Garden view) after my husband called. The fact they put ANYONE in that room OR even on the 10th floor is unbelievable and unacceptable. They also turned off the water due to the construction. They finally moved us to 7 and you could still hear the construction. I understand construction happens but do NOT put guests next to it.

I want to start by saying that the exterior of the resort was beautiful. I went with my teenage kids and they loved the beach, pool and water slide as did I. In fact, in my opinion the Westin had the best beach and pool of all the hotels in the area. The service was mixed. The pool side food service and housekeeping were fantastic. However, the front desk was poor. We booked two hotel rooms through a local travel agent. We requested connecting rooms. The travel agent assured me she me such a request in writing. The Westin clearly knew we had minor children because their ages were on the confirmation voucher. Nevertheless, the when we checked in, I was told by the receptionist that we never requested connecting rooms (a fact my travel agent confirmed was untrue) and even if we did the Westin cannot guaratee connecting rooms unless we paid extra. I never heard of a \"pay extra\" option from any hotel and is clearly not on the hotel's wbsite. Not only did we not get connecting rooms but the rooms on each side of the hallway with 25 to 30 rooms between them (even though I was assured by the clerk before we checked in that it was less than 10 rooms). After much discussion for approximately an hour, the hotel discovered a \"cancellation\" and was able to accomodate adjoining but not connecting rooms. The interior of the hotel was somewhat aged. The carpeting was stained, the walls were marked. In other words it looked like the carpets were not replaced for awhile and walls had not recently been painted. The rooms themselves looked aged. One of the rooms \"heavenly bed\" was over soft compared with the other rooms' beds, the air conditioning did not work properly and we had a wonderful view of the dumpster. The reply from the front desk was we are sorry and will note the same. Not a very satisfactory reply. Overall, I would recommend the hotel for the pool and beach but would be sure to investigate the location of the room.

I spent a great deal of thought and time planning our honeymoon, and I've got to pat myself on the back for choosing correctly. The Westin was top notch. From the moment we stepped through the door into the open lobby, with waterfalls and flamingos surrounding us, my wife was beaming, and didn't stop until we checked out. I booked via Expedia and was happy with my price (heads up to Starwood Preferred Guest members, expedia bookings don't earn you any points). Nevertheless, it paid to have joined Starwood. Upon check-in at about 5pm, I encountered a pleasant staff member who, upon mentioning it was our honeymoon (do this often!), offered us a bottle of champagne and upgraded us from a 3rd floor room all the way to the 9th (top) floor! Was this due to the honeymoon or SPG membership? Not sure, but my money is on SPG... Its free to join so do it! Room was clean, bed was comfy. View from balcony... INCREDIBLE! Pool complex below you, then white sand, & Molokai on horizon to the right, Lanai to the left. The pools were really fun, five of them linked via waterfalls, waterslides, etc. Also a Grotto area, always fun. Maybe a little cool but it takes, oh, about 6 seconds to acclimate, and feels great in the warm Maui sun. Plenty of lounge chairs to go around, in shade or sun. Actually didn't use the beach that much, our one regret. Ate dinner on the night of our arrival at the poolside bar. Its a bar, not a restaurant, but i was perfectly pleased with the burger I ordered. Didn't eat there for any other meals so cant comment on the other restaurants. Room has a small fridge; we bought bagels and snacks to save money on breakfast and lunch, and made our romantic dinners count! Took advantage of the offer of a free photo session; of course they push you to buy, we politely declined and took our freebie which was very nice. A few pointers on island activities: - Snorkeling in Maui is obviously excellent. We rented gear from Boss Frogs in Lahaina, as well as an underwater camera, & were happy with what we got. The Black Rock is about a 10 min walk down the beach (@ the Sheraton) and offers some great, convenient snorkeling in calm water. Also snorkeled at Molokini on a catamaran trip booked thru Boss Frogs. Molokini was great, Turtle Town was a bit of a letdown, only saw two turtles. Oh well. - The Road to Hana is well worth it. Get the banana bread (we loved Aunt Sandy's on Keanae Rd in Haiku), and the Kalua pork tacos at Up In Smoke BBQ, about 10-15 min before you arrive in Hana. Honokalani Black Sand Beach is a nice place to relax before the drive back. We skipped the Haleakala sunrise, maybe next time around. - Luau: We went to the Sheraton's. The Old Lahaina luau is supposedly the highest rated, but its \"authenticity\" means no fireknife dancers. We wanted fireknives, so chose the Sheraton. The Kalua pork was incredible, the drinks were maybe a little weak, but plenty of them. A great time overall! - Dining: Mama's Fish House. Just go, its your honeymoon. Make your reservation early, maybe even before you fly to Hawaii. Our only regret was that we ate too late, didn't have a view of the ocean due to darkness. - Beaches: Kaanapali beach can't be beat... white sand, soft lapping waves, snorkeling. What more do you need? Big Beach in southern Maui was also nice. For the daring, Little Beach is right next to Big Beach. Get the *skinny* on this beach from locals or fellow vacationers, you'll get the *bare* truth if you ask around. Overall, I would return to the Westin in a heartbeat, and would urge anyone I know or who may read this to do the same. Honeymooners, book without fear, you'll remember every moment of the trip.

Location of the hotel could not be better, very close to the Whaler mall where there are restaurants and shops. And that is all. Front Desk employees are overloaded . That is why they are not only unhelpfull, but unhospitable (and I could say even hostil). We arrived at 12 m after a very long flight and asked if maybe our rooms were available. The answer of the guy in the front desk was short and dry: \"Check-in time is 3pm\". Of course we knew that!. He acted like if he were doing us a great favor. He offered two rooms which were inconvenient for us because they were in different floors.We said we would wait. An hour and a half later he gave us one room. At 3 pm the second room was not ready. He told us \"You refused the rooms I offered earlier. You should wait\". At 4 pm our second room was not ready yet. Nobody in the hotel had told the housekeeper to clean that room. Employees of the concierge are not different. I had read the reviews which said that they were more interested in selling the Westin Villas time sharing plans than helping guest with information and reservations, and I tought the writers were exagerating. What we experienced is exactly the same. The ladies had long, long talkings with the prospective buyers, and people who just wanted a restaurant reservation had to wait and wait. I am not in the hotel business, but I have common sense: the management of the Westin makes a big mistake in giving two completely different tasks to one employee. The concierge must help guest. He is not there to sell anything. So, for information and reservation it is easier and faster to look in internet and to call directly. That provided you are lucky with the speed of internet. The service included in the \"resort fee\" is so slow, that you have to be very patient or pay more for the faster one. The rooms we got (\"mountain view\") were ok, but too small for a resort beach. The beds were very good. Renting a chair and an umbrella at the beach is almost impossible. You have to make a reservation two or three days in advance. Later we found out that the reason is a Maui regulation that impose on each hotel a limit of chairs they can put in the beach. Westin has a quote of just 15 umbrellas! If we have known that before, we would have bought them at a store. The gym was pretty well equiped. The problem is that treadmills were in use all the time. We did not stay at the pools, so the only thing we can comment about it is that they looked very crowded at all times. We realized that the best experiencies of our stay in Maui were outside this hotel. The first one, as I said, is the incredible beach. The second one was the snorkeling tour with Trilogy, and the third one was our dinner at Hula grill restaurant. Maui is a lovely place, but the Westin Hotel is definitely not.

I had indicated that it was our anniversary, and upon check-in, a bottle of nice champagne with 2 flutes was delivered to our room. Our room, by the way, was in the beach tower, and it was nothing short of spectacular. A spacious room and bathroom, directly looking out at the ocean. Doesn't get any better than that. We enjoyed being right in the middle of the action; restaurants next door, the boardwalk and the activities counter where you can arrange site seeing or parasailing trips. If you elect to not have your room cleaned, you receive a 20% discount at the hotel's restaurants. That's a bonus.

Our son, who is 10, was able to go from beach to pool safely and he had a ton of fun being somewhat independent. You do need to rent the beach chairs and umbrellas...never mind, you're not vacation and it was worth it. There's a Starbucks in the lobby with lots of breakfast food so every morning, we just had coffee and a breakfast sandwich instead of going to a restaurant. Our room had a small frig and we stocked it with juice, grapes and a couple of beers. The Westin is a Starwood property and I'm convinced they are the best hotel brand out there. What a great time!

We used our room for sleeping and showers and it was great!! Yes the pools are cold but they feel wonderful after being in the sun!!

You have Whalers Village right next door with shops and many dining options. You are also only a 10 minute drive from Lahaina. The only change I would ask the management to make was the time of the Luau.

We enjoyed our stay and we would stay at the Westin again. The entrance, with the waterfall and flamingos, is absolutely beautiful. The pools are so nice, although they were way too cold for the first 2 days that we didn't bother going back in until the last day. At some point along the way the water did warm up to a very comfortable temperature. We stayed at the adult only pool which was extremely relaxing and enjoyable. We had poolside lunch service a few times and the service was good, the food was enjoyable, and although we've seen complaints about the price of the food, we didn't find it to be out of line; remember - you are at a resort and getting food delivered to you poolside so don't expect an $8 lunch! We went to the Luau. It was on site and convenient. The food was as expected at a Luau, and the show was ok (not that I have been to any others to compare). There may be better Luau's to see for a better price, but for me it was just an item on my checklist of things to do, and we enjoyed it. We went on the Gemini for the snorkel and lunch sail. We really enjoyed it; swam with the turtles and saw all as expected. The surprise was the lunch which was much better than we expected. As far as the hotel goes, the staff were very friendly and willing to help, especially the concierge (who actually aren't part of the hotel staff but American Express staff). Our room was as described by others; dated. We knew this going into it, and we were fine with it. We overlooked the parking and the mountain and could see a rainbow almost every afternoon on the mountain. We really weren't in our room that much, so it was fine. The sink was outside the toilet/shower area, but that didn't bother us. Yes - the carpet and furniture could use an upgrade but again - not an issue for us. I read many complaints about the parking spaces in the self park and unless you are there to see it yourself, you can't believe it. We had a Mustang convertible, which seemed to be the average size of rental car. There are many families with vans and SUV's as well. The parking spaces are pretty much the same width as our car, allowing for a few inches to open the door at most. I always had to let my wife out before pulling into the spot as we couldn't possibly both open our doors. What are they thinking!!! The good news is that the lot was often full (luckily) so they would valet the car for no extra charge. By the way, if there are two (at most) travelling, I highly recommend getting a convertible. The location is great, the beach is great, Maui far exceeded our expectations. Here's some info for when you are off the property; We really enjoyed walking around Wailers Village. Hula Grill was very enjoyable; the food and bev's were very good, but the atmosphere was awesome! Leilani's was good - we ate at the dining part - not the casual beach part. Make sure you walk around Lahaina (Front St.) and see the shops & try some restaurants. We ate at Mala and loved it. We also at at Kimo's. The food was average - just try to get a table with a decent view. We also had dinner at The Plantation House which was about 20 minutes north. We got there early and got the best table with a spectacular view of the sunset. The food was great.

I read all the reviews on this property and am not sure if people were just blind or just happy to be in Maui but here is what we experienced. The only positive remark on the property I will make is that the pool and landscaping were nice. That is where it stops!!!!!!!! I booked this hotel many months in advance and had to book 2 rooms so my family of 5 could be together. When I booked the Resort the hotel would not guarantee me a suite with a connector room which is why we had to book 2 ocean view rooms. SO, we arrive at the Westin and upon check-in there was no one to greet us with lei's or welcome us with the exception of the bell man. We checked into our room of which only 1 was ready at that time so this is not a big deal. The lady at the desk, who was very nice, checked us in and said we had a double upgrade (more on this later). Hmmmm, this is okay I thought to myself. Anyway our room was not ready as I said so we decided to have a late lunch. We went to the hostess stand and were given a table. The entire area where the restaurant is located (outdoors) which also connects to the pool area is flagstone. EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE there were ants on the flagstone which we found a bit concerning and we even had the wait staff move us to a different area which still had the same issue but not as concentrated. So we ordered a couple of Mai Tai's which were horrible!! Whoever mixed the drinks needs to stick to pouring only water and soda. Sorry to be harsh but this is a factual statement. After finishing up our late lunch we were able to get into our room. All we wanted to do was drop off our things and head to the pool and see what else was around the Resort. We entered into our room (remember the supposedly double upgrade) and our jaws dropped!! Literally, I thought to myself this is just a tad upgrade from the Days Inn or Holiday Inn but with a view. This is definitely not what a WESTIN room looks like or smells like for that matter. Again, we had 2 rooms now that connected. Oddly, 1 room had a mildew order and the other was ok. WHY? No excuse for this to happen!! I looked at my wife after we dropped our stuff off and said, \"What happened to the double upgrade the front desk lady said we had?\" Disappointment not only had sunk in with me but my wife too at this point. We went downstairs to walk around the Resort and then find a spot to lay down at the pool. One side of the Resort by the KIDS CLUB and down towards where they have the Luau had the same foul mildew smell we experienced in our room. NOT GOOD!!! I got everyone settled in by the pool and went to the front desk and spoke to Michael, who was the Customer Service Manager. He was very polite and nice and I want to make that clear as it is only right to give him the proper credit he deserves. I explained how we were very unhappy with the room and property and asked him to see about a SUITE or move us to the Westin Villas (part of SVO a mile or so down the road from the Westin) if that was an option. I was also willing to pay more points and/or money if need be to upgrade to the Suite too which I was willing to do many months prior to arriving in Maui. Well, the Suite was not available and Michael said he would follow up with me on the Villas. Not an issue I told him and I went back to the pool area and told my wife the update. Now, it was getting late in the afternoon and we were all starting to get tired. We are from the East Coast so a 6 hour timezone change is a bit of a transition. When we got back to our room and got our children settled in Michael called and said he could make the change happen to the Villas and we could go either today or tomorrow. We made the move the next day and I will close with saying to EVERYONE that this was the best decision we made on our trip!! Go to the VILLAS!!!

We traveled with 3 kids and they had a great time. The rooms in the tower section are large enough to accommodate a rollaway The pool is amazing and even has a little cave built in. The only real downside at the Westin is that to get a chair by the pool (especially a rare spot under an umbrella), you DO have to set your alarm, get up early, and stake out a spot; that was disappointing. But overall, we had a wonderful experience. Having Whaler's Village next door was great for shopping needs, souveniers, a snack or meal, or just something different to do. If you want to swim with sea turtles, walk up to Black Rock where you can see them fairly often.

The hotel is very beautiful and clean. They have the best staff members that really care about their guests. My daughter injured her finger by slamming the car door on her pinky by our third day!! While we waited to see someone from the security (which was within a couple of minutes) each employee that walked by stopped to make sure my daughter was ok and if we needed anything and were trying to comfort her! I forgot the security guys name but he was amazing!!! He calmed her down, cleaned and gave me proper supplies to keep her pinky cleaned and protected, and escorted us back to our room and waited to make sure my daughter felt comfortable about her pinky before leaving. I was real nervous that it may have been broken or might need stitches but he reassured me that it was fine. While we were relaxing our room, my daughter received this huge banana split ice cream by another staff member that did not leave my side until the security guy came along (she saw how nervous and scared i was).

Very spacious with lots of storage and plenty of bathroom space as well. There were fridges in the room that were replenished with 2 bottles of complimentary water daily - so be sure to take advantage. One evening I could even see the hotel's luau from our room. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous although we didn't use the pool much.

The drinks are good and the fish tacos are spectacular! We ate the fish tacos three times. :) Our package came with breakfast coupons for the buffet daily and the buffet is excellent. LOTS of choices and it was all excellently prepared. Beware of the crazy birds though that are dying for your food scraps. :) They were quite comical.

I rated this hotel as very good because if I had kids this would have a been a good spot although it was expensive and not worth the fees. The hotel is beautiful and the grounds are well kept. Checkin was easy and the staff was very friendly. I was located in an ocean view room which was nice and had a beautiful balcony. Ask for a higher flood to really get a nice view of the property. Note: If you want to see the Luau without the food. Ask for a balcony room near the stage. You will hear the Luau from whatever ocean view room you are in. So if you want to hear AND see the Luau why not. Food: I travel all the time and avoid hotel food at all costs. However, the food in the hotel is really good although it is pricey. Five thai wings for an appetizer will cost you $11. Property: The hotel has a pond with ducks, flamingos, and fish. There are water features throughout the property and several pools. People put towels on the chairs early near the pool. The property is loud and kids are EVERYWHERE. You can hear them in their rooms from the hall, running up and down the hall, and running near the pool. I'm guessing the spa is one of the few places you can get quiet or in your room in the day time while they are at the pool. The property has a nice ocean fron location. The Westin was pricey and I was thrilled to be spending another 3 days renting an oceanfront condo for over half the price and no noise. Being at the Westin is like being a kindergarten teacher. You are either cut out for the noise or you're not. The $25 a day resort fee is killer and not necessary. The internest is slow. You can not even watch Netflix. To get the higher speed you have to pay another $25 which was ridulous. If you don't use the gym or the pool it's just ridiculous. Location: The location is good. It is about 40 minutes from the airport. I would suggest just using the shuttle although I did enjoy my rental car. SPa: Didn't get to go. The place was booked during their two hour special times. It is pricey so if you're trying to save money call ahead for the specials and book before you get there. TIPS on saving money in Maui 1. Get the circulars at the airport that have coupons. The hotel may have some also. 2. Go to the farmers markets and try the grocery stores the Kona coffee is reasonable around $10 for 100% Kona. Be ready for sticker shock at the prices but there are also some good deals to be had. I shopped mostly at Foodland which is like a cheaper Whole Foods. 3, Longs Drugs - This is a really good place to get your souveneirs, chocolates are cheap and on sale. If you want quality stick with Maui Lona. The other chocolates may be cheaper but they lack the quality. Water, etc.. are also cheaper. 4. Go To Costco right near the airport - they sell the Maui Gold pineapples for $3. Everywhere else sells it by the pound and you will pay almost 5 bucks for it. The airport is ridiculous. Pineapples are the only fruit you can bring home. Also, Costco has things like Teriyaki Ribs and the HI candies are cheaper and in bulk to be bring people back gifts and the Mai Tai mixes are a steal. On some items this Costco is expensive just because of HI prices but you will not get better prices for the size. 5. If you're on a budget there are two shopping centers right on the Honopillani Highway and you can spend less around $10 bucks for a meal. If you want local food try L&L Hawaiian and you will get hooked on the Kalbi ribs. I would try Aloha plate. I wanted to go there and heard nothing but good reviews. They serve Hawaiian food but are a few dollars more than L&L. 6. Rent a condo for the week. You can get Oceanfront and get more rooms and a fully equipped kitchen for 1/2 the price of the Westin. The peace and quiet was well worth it. 7. You will get so many fees tacked onto the rental car that you may want to think twice. When I returned by business car to get my personal car the attendant asked me where did I fill up the car. That's odd. I'm thinking it has a full tank of gas why does it matter. Well in Maui, if you don't fill up in Kihei they will add extra fees like 4 or 10 dollars depending on the location. UNREAL! I rented a car for three days and spent over $50 in fees. If you are expecting upgrades because of your status with Avis First, etc... be aware they have something I have found no where else in the US. They have 2 classes of Full Size cars. So don't be surprised when your upgrade gives you a car that is basically smaller than what it would be anywhere else. The people in HI are great!!! The prices ridiculous! The views gorgeous!

All the chairs were taken at all the pools by 630/700 AM. There is an attendant that comes by and marks your chairs at 730, then comes back by at 830 to make sure you are there, so basically by 830 you have to be at your spot to not lose it. But if you do NOT get to the pool by 630 AM and lay down towels and a shirt or two, you will not get a lounge chair at all, until maybe 3 pm. 2. The Cabanas can be reserved prior to your stay. I tried to get one and they were reserved WEEKS in advance. you can always reserve one and then cancel by 9 am the same day. So better to have one, then not if this is your choice. However, cabanas do not have TV's or even a radio. And there are very few of them. 3. Westin Kids Club, FILLS UP FAST. and only allows a certain amount of kids per counselor. Reserve in advance, you can always cancel. My daughter had a great time here and didn't want to leave. They also do it at night from 6-10. It is kinda pricey, $60 for half day and $80 for full. Only for kids 5 and up. There was babysitting services available. 4. This property is located right next to a shopping area known as the WHALERS Village. Inside this shopping area is an little grocery store called ABC store. You can purchase beer, wine, milk, chips, whatever you need really for at very reasonable prices. We got beer and wine and just stored it in the fridge in our room and drank that by the pool. $7 for a six pack beats $7 A BEER. The hotel drinks are VERY expensive. and I am talking $12 for a pina colada. 5. Next door at the cool Lailani's restaurant is an awesome happy hour every day from 3-5 PM. THey have $4 Mai Tai's, Margaritas and Beer. Also awesome food. I recommend this over the hotel bar/restaurant grill ONO. Which by the way, the hotel food was BAD. only the beach side food was ok. The restaurant TROPICA-AVOID. It was awful. 6. For breakfast and lunch, next door to the hotel near the Whalers Village was Cane and Toro-or named something like this, had INCREDIBLE breakfast. There is also a MCDONALDS in the Whalers Village. Also a SUB shop known as MR. SUB which looked like a hole in the wall, but actually had good Salads and Wraps. I liked the Chicken Ranch wrap and the Greek Chicken Salad. 7. SHUTTLE for Hotel, also services 3 other properties. You are the last to get picked up to head to town, LAHAINA, meaning you don't have to go to any other properties so you get to town quick.... but on the way back to the hotel from your night on the town, they drop everyone else off to the Sheraton, Westin Villas and one other stop prior to the Westin hotel. So, keep in mind the trip on the way back is longer to the hotel then on the way into town. Overall the property was a great location and near lots of shops and restaurants. Would stay here again, but might try Grand Wailea just to switch it up.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cGarden view?\u201d", "Author": "truthbtoldNyc", "ReviewID": "UR115164274", "Content": "It was a nice stay, but I wouldn't go back.

Expect extra daily fees and taxes on the hotel bill. I recommend a cabana by the beach ($55 for 2 people) which has drink service and shade if you want it.

The lobby was beautiful with a huge waterfall. We checked in to two rooms. They were identical in size and shape but one room had a huge table with two chairs blocking most of the entrance to the balcony. I'm sorry I didn't photograph it, because it was just so out of place and awkward. My room didn't have the huge table, but it did have a desk with no chair. I called several times asking that a chair be brought for the desk (see photo), as I had work to do on my computer but the chair was never delivered. Our shower didn't drain and my first shower ended up being a foot bath. We called and maintenance fixed the problem quickly. The room was comfortable enough. Our room was centrally located and therefore we were right above the large waterfall. You can hear the waterfall even with your balcony doors shut and the curtains drawn. It's not a problem, just surprising. The first morning there I was privy to my neighbors VERY loud cell phone conversation he was having on his balcony. It was inconsiderate of him to be so loud before 8am on his balcony, but I also think the hotel could do a better job of sound proofing. The pools were nice but very crowded. There were tons of people walking all over the place all the time. It was Christmas (we checked in on Christmas Eve) so it was a very busy time of year. It was just all a little chaotic for me. We ate twice at the hotel restaurant. Both times it was good. I did appreciate that when we arrived with our car both nights, the self park lot was full so they valet parked us for free. The valet and bell boys were very nice. I didn't chose this hotel, but I don't think I'd stay here again. I gave them 3 stars because I think it is a pretty hotel in a good location (Whaler's village area). I just really prefer the Westin Ocean Villas in the Ka'anapali area.

I booked the Maui Westin Villas for the first time expecting a remarkable one bedroom ocean front suite. Not only did I get a mediocre room w/no view, the hotel is in North Kaanapali located w/nothing around it (nice free shuttle though). We eat all our meals out, so the time share atmosphere wasn't very appealing. For 30,000pts/nite suffice it to say...I wasn't impressed. I'd take the Marriott for time share. So, I got my 180,000 Starpoints refunded! That same day I shot over to the Westin Resort Hotel, spoke to the SPG counter hostess, Dawn, who spent 20 mins filing thru the locked suites to get Suite room #488 using only 12,000pts/nite getting a Plat upgrade. Huge ocean front corner suite; I believe in the Ocean Tower and overlooking the pool. Can't promise she can do the same for you, but I gave her a generous tip for her time & great choice in rooms; it made our seven nite biennial trip the best yet. We used the fold out couch and our own blow up mattress for the children. Our children always love the pool waterslide (best on island), the lounge chairs w/permanent umbrellas for shade and the pool food for lunches. Starbucks and breakfast items are great in the morning. If you can negotiate a good room (suite) w/view...this is the resort. Also, next door to Whaler's Village; ie. Hula Grill (drinks, music & sunset views...food just ok). Best burgers in Lahaina: Cool Cat Cafe. Sunsets: Kimo's. Kapalua rest: Pineapple Grill (get table near window) and best dessert, upside down pineapple cake w/ice cream.

We just love the westin Properties and now, we love Hawaii! I just have three negative comments and then I will praise the resort for our stay. First, upon check-in, as Starwood Preferred guests, we were reserved a room with a free upgrade from a deluxe oceanview. We were told there was no upgrade available. A little disappointing. We had a partial oceanview room facing the Whaler's village. It overlooks the parking lot, which is a very busy, noisy, truck polluted area, especially in the mornings. My second complaint is that the resort, surrounding resorts and the Whaler's village, close VERY early...10pm. Not that we are late party animals, but seemed a little early to have the resort cleared out and so quiet at that time. My third complaint was the self-parking lot. We rented a Ford Mustang convertible, along with probably 30 other hotel guests. The partkingspaces are painted VERY small! Hard to find spots and fit is a suv or car parked line to line. I suggest they repaint the lines to accomodate other vehicles rather than compact cars. I really don't think many people who visit Hawaii rent compact cars. The resort is absolutely beautiful. They do have a resort fee. Resort fee always seems silly to me but just make sure you drink your two bottles of water. Housekeeping was always good, staff was very friendly. Our room included a buffet breakfast which was great every morning. The Whaler's village next door was a nice little shopping center with a McDonalds and a good frozen yogurt shop. We always found chairs at the pools and didn't have a problem getiing a waitress at the pool. They do have a shuttle service to a couple locations as well as the other Starwood propeties, which is nice. Located right on the beach with great access.

We have been staying with Westin for about 25 years because of the quality of the hotel, the location, and quality of service. I felt compelled to write this review so everyone else may take advantage of a level of service that we had never experienced until this past February. I want to introduce you to Stuart. He works in Recreation. This is my families experience that he was responsible for creating. We like to spend all our time at the beach. My son and I boogie board and my wife lays in the son. I went down to the beach early one morning and I was immediately greeted by a smiling, personable, and well spoken young man. He introduced himself and welcomed me and my family to the hotel. He then asked how he could help me? I told him that I wanted to rent an umbrella and chairs which he was happy to help with. He was very helpful in explaining how the rental process works and then took the time to point out which spots were available and those spots that he felt were the best. I chose a spot and he immediately grabbed an umbrella and two chairs and RAN them to the spot I chose. He set it up and then asked if it was to my liking. I told him I would be back later with my family. Before I left, Stuart told me that he could set up the rental for as many days as I wanted to reserve it for. I told him I wanted it all week and he made the proper notations and told the appropriate people. I returned 40 minutes later with my family and we arrived at our chairs which Stuart had already placed towels on for us from the head to foot of each chair. Note: this is not a standard thing that I've seen done before. We had a great day and Stuart came by a few times and aksed if we were having a good time at the resort. We chatted a while and mentioned that we were going to Hana the next day so we would not be there. So...we arrived back at the beach the day after the trip to Hana to find that Stuart had again set up our chaisr with towels and had made towel pillows for us based upon his observation of how we roll our towels during the day. He set us up in the same spot that we had chosen for the week. He came by after we were at the beach about 20 minutes and asked how our trip to Hana was and about how dinner was at a local restaurant. I was shocked that he had remembered details that I had shared two days before and thought enough to ask about it. Stuart's service was ultra-high-quality the entire time we were at the Westin. Stuart is courteous, concerned, compassionate, respectful, and detailed. He takes the opportunity to personalize his service in all that he does. Here is the kicker...The last day we were there we did a whale watching cruise. Stuart knew we went on it that day. When we returned we were heading back to our beach chair when I noticed Stuart running in the distance away from the chairs toward his desk area. I ran to catch him and tell him how impressed I was with his service and to show my gratuity to him $$$. I asked where he was running to and he said he was going to get something he had prepared for my wife, son, and I. He stood and gave me a bag of freshly cut pineapple and 3 ice-cold bottles of water. I asked what it was for, he replied because we had just got off the boat and it was hot day. I told him I was headed to my room and he offered to deliver the bag to my wife for me. He stayed late that day and allowed my wife and I to use our umbrella until the very last possilble minute. We had the only umbrella on the beach and Stuart made us feel like royalty as we sipped our champagne, ate our crackers with our cheese and (pineapple Stuart had provide)d. I felt bad about him staying so long but he insisted that we soak it all up since it was our last day. I took good care of Stuart on our way back to our room and told him I hope he is there the next time we visit the Westin. You wont' believe what happened next. We went out to dinner after having our champagne at the beach. When we got back to our hotel room we found a chilled bottle of champagne with a thank you card from Stuart. Bottom line, Stuart is phenomenal. Make sure to rent a beach umbrella and chairs at the Westin Kaanapali Resort and Spa. Be sure to ask for Stuart in Recreation.

All in all, we still managed to rack up nearly an additional $1000 in expenses in 5 days.($200 for dinner at tropica one night to be fair). Just be prepared! We did the whale watching on the Gemini, well worth it. Book online in advance direct and save over booking through the hotel. We brought snorkel gear and walked up the beach to the rocks by the Sheraton, fabulous! Skip the cost of the catamaran. We did 2 luaus, the old Lahaina luau and the one at the Westin. Do the old Lahaina, the Westin's was way more pricey, and in comparison, kind of cheesy. The hotel has a posted policy about not leaving you towels all day on the chairs at the pool, but never enforces it. If you wish to sit by the pool, you better have your towels out really early in the morning. In the 5 days we were there, I never went to the pool. In part, there is no where to sit because all the towels are sunning themselves, but more because we were on the beach. We rented the umbrella and 2 chaises everyday at the beach. ($40 per day) Will we go again? Oh, no doubt! Stay at the Westin? You bet! Bring a wheelbarrow full of cash? Of course! It's just a reality of vacation that the last memory is the bill under the door!!

We did some extensive research online and decided that the Westin Maui Resort and Spa was where we wanted to stay. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and gives you that island feel from the moment you walk in. We came just in time for Easter which is definitely a popular time in Hawaii. There were definitely a lot of people staying at the hotel. It was still easy to find seating at the restaurants and in-room dining service was quick and efficient. We found it difficult to find pool deck chairs during Easter weekend but that resolved once Easter was over. The pools at this hotel are phenomenal!!! The waterslides, volleyball net and grotto areas were our favorite to spend hours and hours in. The beach is pristine and playing in the surf was so much fun - sometimes I would have to drag my niece in to eat because she was having so much fun. We used the valet parking service but self parking is cheaper and easy to do. I definitely recommend renting a car when you are in Maui - it's easy to find your way on the island and fun to tour around on your own timetable. The staff here are warm and friendly and greeted us whenever they saw us. The houskeeper for our floor would check in with us every morning even if we indicated that our room did not need cleaning. In the interest of the environment this hotel offers a $5 restaurant credit for each day that you do not need housekeeping. We definitely appreciated this perk and were able to save up the vouchers and use them all at once. We had a great time on our special holiday and it is definitely one that my niece and I will remember!

The whole staff including maintenance, maids, pool staff, to the concierge were so pleasent and helpful for anything we needed, even if it was just a friendly smile passing. The concierge Natalie was soooo nice and extra helpful to us, always there to assist. The grounds of this resort was absolutely beautiful! The placement of the pools were well planned with the sound of waterfalls to block the sounds from other pools and excellent views of the beach from almost any chair! You never had to worry about getting a chair, there was plenty for everyone. We loved the adult pool, and relaxed up there every afternoon. The landscape around the pools looked very natural and upkept. A++ on the outdoor pool area!! The entrance to the hotel was so welcoming and i lovedddd watching the beautiful flamingos and koi fish. The location of the resort was awesome. Me and my husband loved going to Old Lahaina Town, which is a old downtown area right on the beach. It is only about 5 mins away from the resort, and you can use the complimentary shuttles the resort offers. Awesome shopping and food there!! You have to try out Kimos if you go there, awesome food!! Also right beside the resort, is a very cute shopping center, Whalers village. You just walk about 10 steps outside the resort and you are there! The best meal we had the whole trip was HULA GIRL in the village. If you stay at the westin, Hula Girl is a must and you have to try the hula pie for dessert!! We also went to the spa when we were there, and both got massages. They were both very good! I would def. recommend the spa!! After the treatment you can sit and overlook the ocean.....very relaxing. If you have facebook, I would \"like\" this westin, you can see any specials and events going on!! Although this was our first trip to Maui, it def. wont be our last trip to this Westin!!!

The suite had 4 sets of sliders, 2 sets in the living room area, 1 set in the bedroom, and 1 set in the large bathroom. The rooms were large, clean and nicely decorated.

We checked out the other hotels on the beach, but liked the Westin the best. The sunset sail we took on the Gemini left from in front of the Westin. A word about Starwoods: my husband has been a Marriott rewards member for more than 10 years. In all that time, he has never received a room upgrade despite being a silver member (staying a minimum of 10 nights a year). Prior to this trip to Honolulu (2 nights) and Maui (9 nights), I joined Starwoods in hopes that booking 11 nights might matter to some hotel chain.

This was by far the best of the three. I'll start with criticism first, before the praise. =) The breakfast buffet is expensive. The food is decent, but you can go next door to Whaler's Village and go to the food court or even ABC Stores for much much cheaper. I did it one day, and was glad I did, because it was tasty. But probably not worth $30/day to do. If it is to you, you won't be disappointed, though. A happy medium between leaving the property and the buffet is the coffee place in the lobby. They have coffee and pastries for a reasonable price. I was able to make breakfast out of that most days. That is my biggest complaint. The rest of the trip was nothing short of spectacular. The pool is large, with 5 options for what you like to do. In most places, the pools that aren't adult pools are super crowded with annoying screaming kids, and this place is no different, HOWEVER, the layout of the pool area seems to mitigate this. It doesn't seem so bad here. There is an adult pool area, but we never went over there as we felt comfortable in the area by the water slide the whole trip. There is plenty of space to find a chair in the sun, or in the shade, or under a palm tree where you can get both sun and shade as the day progresses. Pool side service for food or drinks can be slow, but that is to be expected, I suppose. There are coolers set up pool-side for free, cold water. Worth checking out: the pool side hut/bar near the adult pool - especially after dinner. There is a hot tub up there for an evening soak, also. I would probably skip the luau here, but admittedly did not attend. But the location is right on resort property and doesn't seem very private. There are many others worth checking out off property. There is plenty to explore off the property. Blackrock is right on the beach at the Sheraton, and has amazing snorkeling. We saw turtles each time we snorkled here. It is not too far north down the beach (walking distance). Next door to the resort is Whaler's Village which has a nice selection of restaurants, an ABC store (which is great for stocking up on supplies or alcohol), and a yogurtland - which is a great late night (before 10:00) ice cream place! Great hotel for the value. The rooms are clean and comfortable. We had a beach tower room facing the pool, which is the way to go, I think. Be prepared though: if you have your balcony door open at sunset, you'll hear hundreds of birds chipping as they settle in for the night. If you normally go to sleep a few hours after sunset (which occurred at around 7:00 in late May), you'll be fine as they are quiet by the time it is dark. But if you go to bed near sunset, you may not want that pool-view room - I think you'll still hear them through a closed door. The best value in the area, though, in my opinion. This area of Maui is full of resorts, some of which are nicer than this, but WAY more expensive.

After booking I had read some negative reviews about this particular property and was a bit weary. We had stayed at the Westin Ocean Villas prior to checking in at The Westin Maui Resort & Spa and loved every minute there. Arriving to the Westin Maui Resort and Spa, we truly felt like we were in beautiful Maui. The bell men were fast, efficient and welcoming. The front desk staff was so accommodating. Coming from the villas (where we had a full kitchen) we brought some items which needed to be refrigerated (which we were relying on our mini fridge to do) Since we attempted to check-in way earlier than normal check-in time, our rooms weren't yet available, but the front desk staff took our perishables and stored them in their fridge while we waited to check-in. The gorgeous waterfall and flamingos in the lobby were a treat to the adults and the kids. Such a gorgeous ambiance- they even had flowers out for the ladies' hair- they really had thought of everything! From the coffee shop in the lobby with the self-serve breakfast stand, to the poolside bar and restaurant- the food was all great. While all food and drinks are pricey on the island, we didn't feel like we were paying an arm and a leg for poolside dining. While the property is definitely a bit older- it's the cream of the crop when it comes to location. Conveniently located to shops and restaurants, with a gorgeous stretch of beach, this property really allows visitors to get a little bit of everything! Ready for some sand between your toes? The beach is literally steps away from the resort pool. When it came to our room- we were fortunate enough to get an amazing upgrade. Everything was exactly what you'd expect when traveling Starwood. Beautiful Heavenly Bed, nice amenities, mini-fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TVs and the best part of all- VIEWS, VIEWS, VIEWS! I'd absolutely recommend paying a bit more for an ocean view- after all, you ARE in Hawaii! Of course our room was immaculate and housekeeping was on top of it. As little as this may seem, my fiance and I couldn't believe how fast the elevators were- we never once had to wait to get back to our room. For an older property, they've made all the upgrades you'd want, while accentuating the older features that truly showcase the character of the interior and exterior architecture.

I did plenty of research before we selected the Westin. It came down to Sheraton or Westin. I preferred the location (close to Whaler's Village) and always sleep well in Westin's heavenly beds. The resort had great scenery both within the hotel and oceanside. The entrance is great and has a pond which includes koi, flamingos, and a black swan. Great attractions for smaller children. The pool area is broken up into multiple pool areas which is nice. We spent all or time in the adult pool section so I cannot comment on the other areas. Although they geared more towards families and children. Had a basketball goal and volleyball net for water games. You could have some fun if interested in those items. Guests can also elect to rent beach umbrellas or cabanas on the beach as an alternative to poolside. We elected to rent the beach umbrella on one day and preferred the pool. The umbrellas are nice until people sit in front of you, obstructing your ocean view. Not a big deal for some folks but I enjoyed our time there in the morning before the beach got crowded. Wife and I preferred the adult pool for the majority of our stay. The water slide and pool side bar are both great perks at the hotel. To get away, go under the waterfall within the pool to find the hidden jet pool inside the waterfall. Great secret. The food on premises is expensive but pretty good. The restaurants are not 5 star but everything we tried was very good. This goes for everything from the poolside bar menu and snack bar to the Ono grill, breakfast buffett, and Tropica. We sampled all the food offerings and they all had good quality. Food in general is expensive in Maui if you haven't been. Unless you intend on eating McDonald's every day your meals will run $15 per person and up regardless of where you eat. The Westin is no exception but worth the premium if you don't want to venture off premises for good food. Just next door is the Whalers Village. This is a great spot for dining and shopping. I pity the guests that have to walk from hotels further away, it is literally a stone throw away from the Westin. You have Hula Grill, Leilani's, Cane Taro, among others as alternatives to eating at the hotel. The pricing is similar to the hotel and the quality is about the same. The shopping is also pretty good within the village. Although the area isn't that big so after a few trips through for shopping you have seen everything. My wife and I visited a few times and never returned. The room accommodations vary widely. When I booked this trip I elected to upgrade to the ocean view rooms. Upon arrival they told us all available rooms included two double beds not a king bed. After insisting on a king since this was our anniversary they were able to find one. The room was right next to the elevator and the view was obstructed by the beach tower which holds the deluxe rooms. If this had not been our anniversary we could have lived with the view. The room was small (450 sq. ft) so I went down to the front desk the following morning and explained our displeasure with the room. After explaining our view was not satisfactory and the room was small the front desk representative offered to research options and leave us a message in our room within a few hours. Upon returning to our room after some time in the sun, to our delight, we had a new room booked. The hotel staff moved our stuff (with our permission of course) to the beach tower the next day. The room we had for the rest of our stay was great. 9th floor in the beach tower was superb. The beach towers are 11 floors tall and from 9 to 11 are reserved for Starwood Preferred Guests, so if you are SPG make sure you get these rooms. They are wonderful, fantastic views. I think our room was the deluxe ocean view room. TIP: Over the course of our stay it was evident you get the best front desk service early in the morning. The front desk service tapers off in the afternoon once the \"B\" team shift starts. TIP: If you haven't booked your room, upgrade to the Beach Tower, the rooms are bigger and you have higher probability that your ocean views will be unobstructed. The common areas of the hotel were always clean. The pool area was always kept clear of trash. I could not find anything to complain about during our stay. The shuttles to Lahaina were definitely a huge perk. As you can imagine everything in Hawaii is expensive, including taxi. So taking advantage of a free shuttle to Lahaina gives you numerous dining options for lunch and/or dinner without the expense of renting a car or paying for cabs. The shuttle picks up promptly every hour at a designated spot. Very easy to plan your day and rely on the shuttle for transportation. The much discussed RESORT FEE. I don't think the resort fee is that big of a deal. You get 2 bottled waters, which in Hawaii is about a $10 per day value. The fee also includes free parking and internet access. The internet access is somewhat on the slow side for most people but the parking seemed to be sufficient. We rented a car for 24 hours to drive to Hana ourselves and the one night we parked lot had space at around 4:30pm. The exception was about 9:30pm when we returned from dinner in Lahaina that same night. The hotel staff greeted us and parked our car in valet complimentary since the lot was full. Overall the Westin Maui Resort was a great value. Nothing in Maui is cheap. If you agree with the phrase, \"you get what you pay for\", then take a serious look at the Westin. Perfect balance between price and amenities, providing great value to vistors of West Maui.

The resort is very beautiful, from the front desk up to the room. I loved the open air lobby! At night the lobby is nice and quiet and they serve coffee for those who can't get on the Hawaii time clock. I spent several nights in a cozy chair, sipping on coffee and looking at the stars. They also provide daily flowers for your hair in a basket at check in as well as shell lei's for the gentlemen. It was a nice touch! We had originally requested and paid for an ocean front view room. At check in, we were told they did not have our room available and we were moved to a mountain view room. We were very upset...until we got to the room and saw the view! Knowing what I do now, I would not waste money on an ocean view. Waking up every morning and sitting on the balcony watching the morning storms pass over the mountains was HEAVEN! The poor folks on the ocean view side were stuck in direct sunlight and the sounds of screaming children below them in the pool. No thanks! Speaking of children...they were everywhere. While I was vacationing with older folks in my party, I was on a family vacation- so children did not bug me. However- I would not suggest this hotel to a honeymooning couple or anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing time. It's possible that it was due to summer time travel, but even the pool was very appealing to the \"family with children\" crowd, so I am assuming they typically have children on the property. The pools were beautiful! I even went down the waterslide a few times just for kicks. The lifeguard was not paying too much attention to who was getting on the slide- therefore, several people walking the beach that were not staying at the hotel were using the pool. The adult pool was not enforced as adult only during my stay. I had several children splashing around in the hot tub and the pool the few times I attempted to visit it. Also, it's not secluded from the family pool, so you won't find much relaxation here. The onsite restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were pretty good. I forget the name already, but we dined at the restaurant in front of the spa the night they opened it after renovations. The food and service was pretty good, but as you can expect- was overpriced. Breakfast in the lobby was pretty good and a decent price. The room itself was quite small, but very clean and comfortable. As we did not spend too much time in the room, this was not a major issue. I loved the lotions/shampoo/soaps that the hotel places in your room. The best I've ever seen at a resort! I spent a day in the spa and had a massage by the ocean. Please note- the oceanside massage is under a cabana at the pool. I could barely hear the waves- mostly just heard children screaming. The massage itself was not bad, but I have had better at Massage Envy! Next time, I would take a pass on this. My favorite part of the spa was sitting inside the calm room, munching on the dried pineapple, almonds and drinking the lavender lemonade that came complimentary with your spa services. It was the quietest spot I found all week and I gladly spent a few hours relaxing there. The staff was a bit lacking as far as customer service goes. I never experienced anything horrible, but even more so- never experienced anything great. They seemed pretty understaffed all week and were pretty short with customers. I found this unfortunate considering everywhere else I went- I had the BEST customer service. I just loved how friendly the Hawaiian people were during my stay. The beach was unforgettable. Great swimming, perfect temperature and nice soft sand. Renting a chair or an umbrella costs an arm and a leg as you would expect, so not much lounging happening on the beach. If you are looking to paddleboard, head about ten minutes south of the resort to rent your board. The rentals at this resort are WAY overpriced. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay! The proximity to Whalers Village and the beautiful modern amenities of this resort were well worth what we paid.

We are SPG owners and requested 2 rooms near each other on the \"owners\" floors. We checked in and were placed on the 7th floor (lower floor) in a room the size of a closet (I was told by the staff all the rooms would be the same). Given we were getting in at 12am, I decided to let it go and went to the concierge desk the next day. I especially wanted to change rooms because a huge tree outside our room was home to literally hundreds of very loud birds each morning. The concierge directed me to the front desk person who was alone on the desk and clearly overwhelmed by the line of people checking in/out and wanting changes. When I got to her and explained our original request, she said there weren't any owner's floors (though the upper floors had signs indicating such) and that all rooms were the same. I asked again about changing both rooms and she slapped a map of the resort on the counter and said, \"Well, you tell me where you want to move because I certainly don't know what you want.\" Hello? Service with a smile? I explained again, very politely, that we wanted to be on an upper floor, not near the elevator, and that the reservations had been made in August, and we appreciated her help. She went on the computer for a while and found two rooms on an upper floor that would be available later in the day. I thanked her, we packed our bags to be moved when the rooms were available, and went on our way. When we returned, we went to our rooms and found one room was directly across from the elevator and the room was very dirty (e.g., hair on the bathroom floor, damage to the walls, etc.). The elevator is very old and the whole night we could hear it grinding up and down the building, stopping at every floor. We decided not to try again, but looked forward to leaving as soon as we could. I will say the grounds are beautiful and the breakfast buffet was sufficient (would be nice to have different items every once in a while). The service throughout the property was not good- people didn't help those of us staying there or each other (often heard arguments among the staff and blatant sabotage of each other). We did enjoy the fitness room and very much appreciated the use of workout clothing. I do not recommend this resort.

Overall we thought it was ok. Let me start off by saying, do NOT waste your money booking the \"Deluxe Ocean View\". As other reviewers have stated (and I wish I had actually taken their advice), this room ONLY faces Whalers Village. The room is a great size, but it's loud. Period. We switched to the Ocean Tower and although the room was smaller, we actually thought the view was MUCH better and the room much quieter and, therefore, thought we got better value for our money. The main con about this room is, like others have said, the sink is outside the bathroom. The light switch for the toilet/shower is next to the sink so these two factors make it a bit awkward in the middle of the night. Who cares that the room is a bit small. It's the size of most normal standard rooms and we, personally, don't need a huge room. Three most important things about it: GREAT view... the only noises you really hear are the sounds of the waterfalls at the pool (a good white noise) and the beds are very comfortable. Think about it... all those other factors like the food, etc.... you're going to eat around town anyway right? I do agree with others that it might be time for a little \"spruce up\" of at least part of the property. Don't bother with the breakfast deal. The food is fine but I think most people enjoy trying different places. The staff was nice and accommodating. Maybe they're not the warmest people on Earth, but they do their jobs and are polite. I think some other reviews might be a little unfair towards the staff. Overall, the place gets a solid \"good\" rating from us. If you're reading this and still not 100% set on going to Maui, might I (highly) recommend the Koa Kea Resort in Kauai. I forgot to write a review after our honeymoon there last year. Now THAT'S close to perfect! Two great restaurant recommendations: Lahaina Grill (in town) and Merriman's (near the Ritz) You won't be disappointed!

I will rate this hotel first and then Maui. We had a Premium Delux Ocean view room in the Beach Tower on the 8th floor, and far away from the elevators; the room faced the Ocean with a panoramic view and overlooked the Pool area as well. This is the most expensive room they offer, aside from a Suite. There are 11 floors and I think this room type is floor 5 or higher. We stayed on a Starwood Friends and Family rate which was half the rack rate. So, we don't have any room to complain given the enormous discount. Pros - Our room was in the perfect location and the view was wonderful. The heavenly beds are awesome! Cons - the room was a bit small and so was the little patio. Not a big deal though. The bathroom had 2 sinks and a nice shower. What we didn't like was that the room would not get cold enough. We like to sleep with it really cold. We set the air on 65 (as low as it will go) but we were still hot. We even had a large floor fan sent up to our room, but it didn't help all that much. Maybe it was just our room, who knows. Okay, whatever you do, do not stay in the Ocean Tower or you will be very dissapointed. We spoke to other guests at the pool staying in that tower (which is older) and they said the rooms were tiny and the sink was in the bedroom, not the bathroom. I had read this before we booked and made sure we were in the Beach Tower. The Premuim Delux Oceanview rooms are only located in the Beach Tower, so if you book that, you are safe. There are a ton of rooms that face the parking lot in the Ocean Tower. There are also a ton of rooms in the Beach Tower that face the side where Whalers Village is (opposite side of pool area). That side is no good because it's very loud in the mornings with trucks delivering things. I do think the Westin is the nicest hotel and has the best width sand on this stretch of Kna'anapali Beach. We walked down to Blackrock at the other end and thought those hotels looked dirty and old. There is one on top of Black Rock that looked nice but we couldn't really see it. I think it may be the Sheridan. Also, if you have snorkeled in the Carribean, don't waste your time in Maui. It was pitiful. We snorkeled at Black Rock and on an all day excursion to Molikini. There is nothing to see except a few fish and large turtles. We drove over to the Ritz to check it out...amazing! If you can afford to stay there it seemed wonderful. We didn't walk down to the beach so I don't know what it's like there. The pools at the Westin are all very nice and we had no trouble at all getting chairs to lay in. I don't think it was busy when we were there May 2nd - 10th. If you want an umbrella and chairs on the beach it is $35/day. We did that one day to be close to the ocean. The grounds are well kept and very pretty. Don't waste your money eating at the Westin unless you have bkfst included in your room rate. It's such a rip off and you will find MUCH better food next door at Whalers Village. There is a Coffee Stand at the Westin that serves Starbck Coffee (a large is $8) and all sorts of cerials, fruit, pastries, oatmeal, smoothies etc. It is so expensive though. We went to Safeway and bought coffee, milk, coffee, cream, cerial, bananas, beer, peanut butter, chips, salsa etc. We were so happy we had our own food. We made coffee in the mornings, sat on the little patio, then made a simple bkfst. That way we could spend our money on other things. We even ate at McDonalds a few mornings for pancakes and sausage. For lunch and dinner, Hula Grill in Whalers Village was our absolute favorite restuarant in Maui based on quality, price, and service. We ate there 5 times. Leilanai's is right next to it; we ate there for dinner once and thought it was good too. Cane and Taro is behind Hula Grill. They had great Sushi Rolls and I had one of the best Lamb Shanks I've ever had. If you have a car, drive to Plantation House (close to the Ritz) for dinner around 6:00. The view i& sunset is breathtaking and the food was good. I would call and make a reservation for one of the tables by the windows. You won't be dissapointed. Do not waste your money on Mama's Fish House in Paia. We paid $50 for stuffed Mahi and it was fine, but seriously. We had hear so many people rave about it but we thought Hula Grill was way better. We went to the Spa for massages twice. Both times we had a wonderful experience. As far as Maui goes, the weather wasn't great while we were there so we were sad about that. The scenery is beautiful with the mountains and ocean. However, it was cloudy most of our trip. We went to Turks and Caicos last year and once we were in Maui, we wished we had gone back there. I'm sure the weather contributed to this, but our other reason is that if you are going to the beach the whole point for us is to enjoy the sand and water. The water in Maui was very cold and the waves were constantly coming in. We only got in the water once. It's also not that beautiful clear Carribean water where you can see everthing. In Turks, we were in the water the whole time and you could snorkel right in front of your hotel...amazing snorkeling and diving. It was so calm there, we laid out on rafts in the water. Also, you have to pay $35 to lay on the beach at the Westin and we just weren't going to do that every day. In Turks, they set up 2 chairs and an umbrella just for us every day right on the beach....no charge. Back to Maui - we did the drive up Haleakala to see the sun rise. But, it was so rainy & cloudy we didn't see anything. If you plan to do this, do it soon after you get there when your sleep is still of kilter because they pick you up at 2:30 a.m. Also, bring jeans, sweats, jacket etc. It was in the 40's up there at 10,000 ft. We biked down the mountain and that was pretty cool. I'd reccomend this. I hope this was helpful. I reviewed Trip Advisor for months on end trying to decide where to go. All in all, stay at the Westin if you can afford the Premium Delux Ocean View Room or at least a room guaranteed in the Beach Tower facing the pool side.. Maui is very expensive so be prepared to spend some money while you are there.

The hotel was beautiful, the pools were very nice (the kids loved them), and the beach right in front of the hotel was great. We had a garden view room on the 2nd floor, but because of the landscaping, our back patio was right at ground level--it was very quiet and private. The pros: Clean room/good maid service Bell hop hooked us up with free stuff left by previous guests (boogeyboards, beach mats, etc.) There are plenty of freebies to be had, so I would check at the hotel before I bought any sorts of water toys. Beautiful grounds Helpful and friendly staff Nice, central location Breakfast buffet was included and was pretty good . .. well stocked, clean, and consistent day-to-day. Complimentary valet parking when self-park was full (all but one time this was the case) The cons: VERY crowded (all but two of our eight day stay, if you were not sitting in a poolside chair by 7:30am, you were not going to have a chair that day). They were actively \"bouncing\" people from holding chairs, and you still needed to be down there early to claim a chair. Two different days we unknowingly sat in chairs that had been reserved by someone prior to 6:00am. The staff had confiscated their items before we got there, but that did not stop them from harassing us about it and try to bully us into giving up our seats. I really did not appreciate the stress and tension that the chair situation brought on--I was there to relax! Workout room was very warm and crowded. I think the temp was due to the number of people in there. Most days all of the treadmills were taken each time we looked. On the quiet days I was able to get in there and get a treadmill and it was cooled down a bit. This resort just seemed to be overcrowded in all facilities. We never received this complimentary tote bag that everyone is talking about. We saw people with them, but never got one. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have. The kids eat half price is a joke. Part of the reason we picked the Westin is we were sold a package including kids eating half price. All it means is that the Westin has a kids menu . .. they call it half-size, for half-price or something like that. It was typical bar food/kids menu items, and anyone walking in off the street could get those same prices (just don't pay extra for this). We finally wandered over to the mini food court at Whaler's village and were able to find a decent salad and sandwiches on whole wheat (we wished we would have tried this sooner--but were not expecting anything very good out of a mini foodcourt). The beds are standardly outfitted with down comforters and feather pillows. Being allergic to down/feathers, I requested that they make up one bed non-down, which they nicely did. The only problem was that every night I would be sitting in bed and start coughing . . .turns out the maid would mix pillows/covers up between the beds. Every night we had to sort through all the bedding so that I could get a non-feather bed. Again, not a huge deal, but if you are allergic this is not fun! I've experienced similar problems at other Westins . . .I think they have a corporate misunderstanding of guests with allergies. We started using our breakfast buffet vouchers at the Sheraton. It was so nice that we had the ability to do this. The staff there was friendly and welcoming. The food was equally good to that of the Westin (though a bit different in offerings) and it was SO much quieter. We enjoyed the peace and quiet and noticed that this hotel was MUCH less crowded. All in all, it was a great vacation. This is a nice property, and great for kids. If the price were the same, I would stay at the Sheraton or Hyatt, given the choice. We visited the other resorts just to compare and the Westin was far and away more crowded than the other two.

When we got back from dinner the spots I had photographed were wiped down and the entire room had been cleaned again. BUT it was hardly a VIP cleaning. There was still dirt/grime on the shower fixture (which I wiped off myself) along with built up scum on the shower control which would have come off had they been serious about cleaning the room. I took more photos and we just went to bed, it had been a long day. The next day my wife complained to me about not sleeping well because her sinuses were irritated. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain to the front desk that morning because we were in a hurry to leave and it felt like it would have been a waste of our time. When we came back that evening my wife starting complaining about not feeling well again and we began to wonder if something in the room was bothering her. Looking around we found some black mold like substance in the crown molding above the bed (on the wall that divided the bathroom and sleeping area). That was it, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying another night in that room. We went down to the front desk and demanded to be moved to a different room. The hotel was near capacity and only had 2 rooms for us to choose from. Both rooms came with a parking lot view (we had an ocean/Black Rock view before) and were smaller than what we currently had. But there was no way my wife was spending another night in our initial room so we opted for the higher floor (with 2 double beds nonetheless) and moved our stuff over. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well that night either. All night long we heard road noise from the highway, random car alarms going off in the parking lot and the friendly garbage truck with its beep-beep-beep in the morning. The bathroom in the new room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much cleaner either. Again there was a lot of built up dirt/dust from weeks of neglect (I took more photos). Keep in mind that this room is on a different floor (2 vs. 8) in a different tower so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not likely the result of the same cleaning person with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153training issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We ended up being contacted by the General Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive assistant because the GM was out for the week. She was a very helpful woman and easily the nicest member of the hotel staff we had encountered. She tried to get our room upgraded but there was nothing available. She also took care of our charges for the first 3 nights we had to endure in room 287 and gave us some additional SPG points. Finally she treated us to a luau at the Sheraton with premier seating. All nice gestures that we appreciated but the damage had been done by that point. Overall I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend anyone stay at this Westin. However, if you do choose to spend your time here check the condition of your room and stay away from anything by the parking lot. Despite what they tell you it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quiet, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get one good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep while we were there.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newtown, PA", "Title": "\u201cRoom a disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Songbird811", "ReviewID": "UR104957367", "Content": "We stayed here the beginning of March, moving from the Ritz to be closer to the town of Lahaina.

Not unlike being on a cruise ship, there are a lot of additional costs you must be ready for. There is a $25 per day per room \"resort charge\". The food, beverages, snacks, etc. are outrageously expensive. You expect to pay a premium at a Hawaiian resort, but $3 for a bag of chips? $7 for a hot dog? A hot dog? Muffins and coffee in the morning.....$50. There is a Safeway in Lahaina, go there, stock up on beer, wine, muffins etc. Many people do. You won't be the oddball. All in all, we still managed to rack up nearly an additional $1000 in expenses in 5 days.($200 for dinner at tropica one night to be fair). Just be prepared! We did the whale watching on the Gemini, well worth it. Book online in advance direct and save over booking through the hotel. We brought snorkel gear and walked up the beach to the rocks by the Sheraton, fabulous! Skip the cost of the catamaran. We did 2 luaus, the old Lahaina luau and the one at the Westin. Do the old Lahaina, the Westin's was way more pricey, and in comparison, kind of cheesy. The hotel has a posted policy about not leaving you towels all day on the chairs at the pool, but never enforces it. If you wish to sit by the pool, you better have your towels out really early in the morning. In the 5 days we were there, I never went to the pool. In part, there is no where to sit because all the towels are sunning themselves, but more because we were on the beach. We rented the umbrella and 2 chaises everyday at the beach.

I'm glad we did. I have to admit the hotel is looking a little tired in places (elevators) but overall the hotel is wonderful, offering all the amenity choices we love. Every morning we'd wake up and not being lovers of heavy breakfasts, we immediately fell in love with the Starbucks cafe in the hotel lobby situated alongside a pool with parrotts and flamingos! Pasteries, bagels and fruit were on offer with a Starbucks coffee - heaven. Then off to the pool where we never had any issues with finding sunbeds. The adult pool is fabulous - quiet and has it's own pool bar. Then off to lunch at the Whalers village and always to the Hulu Grill which offered entertainment and fabulous food overlooking the ocean. The hotel offers a free shuttle serivce to Lahaina every hour from the hotel (5 mins drive) which we took most evenings and the town is full of art and gifts shops and many restaurants. We booked the Lahaina Luau through the hotel tour operators and it was one of our best nights. A five course meals full of maui delights, endless wine/cocktails and hawaian entertainment - a simply wonderful romantic night. We also took the Gemini trip (again booked with the hotel) to whale watch and finally also experienced the helicopter ride looking at the waterfalls. Yes we splurged but it was a much anticipated holiday and enjoyment was our goal. The only small disappointment occured when we checked into the hotel and our initial room had the tinest bathroom ever!

My husband and I were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary, so this was our second trip to Maui, and the kids' first (ages 13 and 10). I strongly recommend this hotel - following is a listing of highlights: * Pools. Probably the #1 thing we consider when choosing a hotel - and they were fantastic. The water was sometimes a bit cooler than I would like (admittedly, I prefer bath-type warmth!), but the kids had a blast. We played water volleyball almost every day (sadly, the girls did not win). * Staff. The entire staff was attentive, thoughtful, and friendly. I'd like to especially acknowledge Gigi, Assistant to the hotel's GM. When we arrived in our room, a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us, and cookies/milk for the kids. Really, really thoughtful. Anytime we had questions, Gigi or one of the other friendly staffers was there to help. In fact, one time, our Mustang convertible needed its battery jumped in the parking lot, and one of the valet staffers quickly saved the day. * Food. We loved the buffet breakfast - it had something for everyone, ranging from eggs benedict, to custom-created omlets, waffles, french toast, various types of sausages, bacon, lots of fruit, and more. What a great way to kick-start the day (and a great view of the ocean to boot!). The kids also loved Tropica for dinner (beef satay appetizer was great for them). * Location. Perfect in every way... Short walk to Black Rock for amazing snorkeling (our second day, we saw 4 beautiful green sea turtles), plus great boogie boarding if you walk to the left toward where the surfers hang out. Proximity to Whaler's Village was another huge plus. We LOVED Yogurtland and truly enjoyed our dinner at Hula Grill and Leilani's. * Ambiance. Natural ponds with koi were beautiful, and the parrots were fun to watch (my husband's favorite was \"Bob\" - the blue one... he liked to sit on my husband's shoulder and take his hat off with his beak!). They also have two gorgeous black swans: Kramer and Newman (you'll have to look to find one of them, he likes to hang out near the adult pool). To address some of the negative reviews... you can't please everyone all of the time. Our thoughts: * Condo pitch: Only got it once, and the concierge was extremely nice and respectful when we said we were not interested. Totally not a hard sell whatsoever. * Internet: Worked fine for us! * Pool chairs: We never really had an issue. Some days, we got up early (7a) and were easily able to find four chairs right upfront. Other days, we were out and about, returning in the afternoon - and again, had no issues finding chairs.

I even got married on the grounds in 2007 so I'm very familiar with this hotel. This was by far the worst I have ever seen it. I'm a Starwood Gold member so I have come to expect a little more out of a Starwood Hotels. First the good: Shuttle- We flew in to West Maui instead of Kahului and were picked up at the airport by a free shuttle that I had prearranged. Pool Staff- Hard workers and very polite. Pool- Beautiful as well as the grounds. Location- excellent. Right in the heart of Kaanapali Beach. Rooms: Clean but dated. Now lets get to the bad: Check in: As a Starwood Gold member I used to not have to wait in line at this Westin to check in. There was a seperate line for Gold and Platinum memebers. Not any more. I was told to go stand in line with everyone else. Clerk was rude. Told her I was over there for our anniversary and that we got married at the hotel and she never even looked at me or spoke a word. Upgrade: The hotel was at 75% capacity when I was there. We were upgraded to Ocean view but had to get a room with two double beds. A room here with two beds is very tight. Not much room to move. (Found out from another gueast who isn't a Starwood member that he got upgraded to an oceanview with a king sized bed, and he booked it within a week through Orbitz. He also got a bottle of champagne because the check in clerk asked him if he was there for a special occasion and he said it was his anniversary). Internet: Terrible. Worse than dial up. You are paying for high speed internet through the resort fee. Breakfast: Wasn't able to get breakfast included by booking through Starwood but other people we talked to who booked through Apple Vacations and who were not Starwood members were able to get it. Pool Bar: The upper pool bar used to have a thing called Unwind. It was between 5pm and 6pm every night and they had someone singing Hawaiian songs and a girl hula dancing. That was done away with. Now all that is offered is the same surfing videoes I have seen for the past 10 years and Stevie Ray Vaughan music blaring over the speakers. Doesn't really set the mood for Maui. Happy Hour doesn't start there until 8pm. If you are from the East Coast, you are pretty much ready for bed by then. If you want something nice, walk up the beach to the Sheraton. They have Happy Hour from 4-6 and they have a singer every day. Puts you more into the island feel than the Westin. Coupons; We used to be given free drink or appetizer coupons from the pool staff. Those days are gone. It's obvious that the Westin has cut back on everything. Consierge: You will get hounded about getting in on a time share. It's happened to me there for the past 5 or 6 years and it still happens. You will get the same box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts though if you stop and see them. Tsunami: We were there during the tsunami. We were on the 8th floor so I guess no one figured we needed to know of the coming tsunami. We were never notified of anything. The sirens were going off but you couldn't hear them with the door shut and the AC on. Would have slept right through it if our family wouldn't have called our cell phone. The next morning we bought breakfast from a very limited menu. Friends of ours who were staying at the Grand Wailea said that they all got a free continental breakfast and everyone in the hotel was notified of the tsunami. There was a hand written sign in the lobby stating that the road was closed but if I wouldn't have walked past it, I would never have known anything about the tsunami from hotel staff. I addressed my concerns with the manager. I told her that it was obvious to me that the Westin is cutting costs in every area. I explained that I was a Starwood Gold Member and have been treated better in the past. I explained that we got married there, and we come back every year and stay with them and no one acknowledges that fact. She was sympathetic and apologized. When I explained that I didn't even have a car there and I wasn't happy about paying the resort fee for which parking is included, she agreed to waive it. Next year I will look at which hotel gives me the most for my money. I will no longer be loyal to the Westin as I can see which direction this hotel is going. I will look to the Sheraton or Hyatt Regency or possibly stay in Wailea. The Maui feel is no longer at the Westin. It has now just become a bunch of pushy tourists and grumpy staff members.

Normally they are very nice but this woman was pretty rude. So, let me see if I got this. They put room packages out there to lure guests. Then when someone purchases that, you treat them poorly? They call every morning to tell you that you have a personal concierge but what that person really is trying to do is set up a condo sale for you. They seem more interested in selling condos than taking care of guests. Pretty tacky for a Westin property. Our Orbitz package included the breakfast buffet everyday. After 4 days we got tired of it... Poor quality. We ended up walking to the Sheraton everyday after that. Excellent food there. One of our biggest disapointments was the pool. It was so cold you could hardly stand to be in it. Even the kids couldn't stand it. The towel guy said the heater's been broke for 6 months. The pool waitress said its always this cold. The manager said when its cold outside like this, the heaters can't keep up. (We had 14 days of 82 degrees and virtually no wind). There is also little to no security. Some local kids stole some of our stuff while we were in the pool. One night, 6 local surfers and their new girl friends stage a soft core porn show in the hot tub. No security... so we ended up going to our room for the night. Our tub/shower drain wouldn't work so you had to stand in a foot of water when showering.

Close enough to whale-watch from your hotel room (they provide binoculars!). The pool areas were super -- the hotel was full but we had no trouble reserving nice chairs at the adult pool every day. Poolside service was excellent (with delicious fish tacos!). Our room was a seventh floor deluxe ocean view (Beach Tower) on the Whaler's Village side, so although we saw the shoppers we also saw a quiet, scenic stretch of beach from our room. The room was spotlessly clean and very quiet. Fridge, HDTV on all channels, plenty of space for all our bags.

We've stayed at probably 10 Westin's around the world in the last several years and this was by far the most disappointing. The goods - housekeeping - solid, what more could you ask for? We asked for a few more amenities and they provided them. - the lobby & grounds - very nice. Not so spectacular and serene, but solid nonetheless. You can walk out to the beach quickly, and walk down the path along the beach either way for a leisurely walk. - the pool - good enough for us, we enjoyed it and spent a fair amount of time there. - refrigerator - glad to have one as we bought water, etc. before we arrived and it came in handy - parking - when the self-parking fills up, they valet for free. Expected, but a nice touch. - workout room - it's open 24 hours and has a great view, although a bit small The bads - check-in - the process itself wasn't so painful but the \"attitude\" was.

But they didn't seem to want to help at all or make it seem like they were trying. We checked online and saw that some upgrade rooms were available. When we checked in subsequent days if upgrades were available, one of the front desk staff actually got into a debate with us as to how many Starpoints it costs to stay at the property. I'm not exactly sure how it got to this as my wife was the one who had the conversation, but to me it just showed that they weren't trying to help, and were instead trying to justify themselves. Even if you aren't going to help, at least act like it. This really hurt our impression of the hotel and of Westin. - the rooms - they are just dated, plain & simple. There are rust marks in several places, the shower is just really old. - no bath gel - they don't offer bath gel standard in the rooms, I've never seen that as a Westin. Alot of things at this property just reeked of \"cost savings.\" Given that the hotel was packed (we also think there was some kind of convention there), maybe they feel that they don't need to go above & beyond to operate this hotel.

Maui is beautiful. You could easily see the whales from the very nice beach. The weather was great. We avoided the rush for pool chairs by paying $50ish for a beach cabana daily (for us, it was worth it). The hotel is lovely and very well located (if you don't mind a lot of people milling about). The staff were all very nice and helpful and yet.... I feel ripped off. The hotel has 2 towers. The Ocean tower is old and the rooms are small. The beach tower is newer, the rooms are larger and it was in pretty good shape. So, after doing my usual thorough research, we booked a deluxe ocean view room (beach tower). For those of you looking to book this hotel, you know that this is a pricey room category. So what did we get? The daily sound of trucks backing up from as early as 4:05am and more typically 6am. When I think \"Deluxe Ocean View\" this is not what comes to mind. This room category is adjacent to the Whaler's village and is compromised due to the continual unacceptable noise level, yet the Westin only sells rooms at this hotel based on tower and view (I know because I asked). This means that the noise level is not something they think should be considered when pricing their rooms. I phoned to complain and was told that we could voluntarily downgrade to the Ocean tower for no credit (they were full). But the manager said we probably shouldn't do that since those rooms are small and in need of renovation. I then asked if we could be moved to another starwood property in the area. I was told that they couldn't move us and, if we leave early, they charge a one night penalty - but that they would wave it for me. As if they were doing my a favor. The room was not ready until 1.5 hours after check in time and another day, the room wasn't cleaned at all. Even when they did clean it, the room wasn't that clean, left over hair from the last guests, an odd smell in the bathroom (like an old mop), coffee pot not cleaned. Our shower wasn't cleaned once in 9 nights. It would have to be fairly bad for me to notice. Please, Westin management, do not tack a patronizing comment to this review about how you are glad that I enjoyed Maui and that you take your customer feedback seriously .

I stay in all types of hotels and resorts -- Fairfield Inn to Four Seasons. I'm not overly picky but my rule of thumb for a hotel is: \"at least as clean as my home\". The Westin Maui Resort & Spa would qualify in most public areas but failed in the guest room, corridors and some public rest rooms. ROOM- Our room in the Ocean Tower was crowded with furniture. An armoire was necessary due to the lack of a closet. This, plus a desk, a nightstand and two double beds made the room a bit tight and we are only 2 adults and a 7-year-old. The Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bath were very nice amenities but did not mask the dated bathroom, fixtures, tiles, beat-up doors, etc. The in-room safe was large enough to hold our laptop and the mini fridge was ample and quite handy. I can overlook \"dated\" if the room is very clean but dated and dusty is harder to accept. The lamps and shades in the guest room and the corridors were covered with dust-- a lot of dust. 7 nights and they were never touched. Overall the room was much less than expected and certainly did not resemble the guest room shown on the website. SERVICE- the service in general was average. There were a few cases with the parking Valet, the towel desk, Sea Dogs and in Ono (the main restaurant) where we experienced \"good\" to \"very good\" service but, generally \"just okay.\" LOCATION- was very good. Adjacent to Whaler's Village (shopping area) on a beautiful section of Kaanapali beach. The swimming pool was a highlight for our 7-year-old and we enjoyed it as well. The real bugger was that if you did not go out before breakfast and claim a pool chair (which is NOT \"permitted\" but totally ignored and not enforced at all) you were out of luck by mid-morning. I literally could not find a single chair (just for me ....not a group of chairs for my family...just one chair) by 10/10:30am on several days. There were towels and more towels drapped everywhere on every chair. No belongings, no people. Didn't dare touch/move those towels or someone would think you were trying to take them (becuse you sign them in/out on your room and face a $25 charge if you lose/fail to return it) If you want a beach chair, you can rent it but that's not convenient to the pool. Bringing the chair reserving situation to a staff member's attention earns an apology but no real resolution. The resort fee (mandatory) includes high-speed internet, self-parking and two bottles of water each day. In my opinion, a good value except for the chaotic parking situation. Every time you'd come back to the hotel it was a race around the small parking lot to find an available spot. Often you'd have to drive back to the resort entrance and the valet would park it. Guess where they park it? If you were lucky enough to grab a spot in the self parking lot.... great....until you try to get your car out and find the valet has someone else's car (the guy who couldn't find a spot) blocking you in and you have to hike back to the hotel entrance and wait for the valet to come move that car so you can get out. Overall the problem seems to be that the hotel has outgrown itself. In my opinion, It seems like they've added more and more rooms/towers but the pool, beach and parking lot are quite overcrowded. LIKED BEST: The breakfast buffet in Ono was excellent, the grounds are beautiful and the beach and location are super.

If you enjoy surfing, Chris plays some outstanding big wave surf videos on the bar TVs. This bar also featured a night time happy hour which was a very good value. The hotel also does an excellent job of managing children at the pool areas, having separate family and adults-only pools for whatever your circumstances dictate.

On the plus side, it has a beautiful fantasy lobby with a huge waterfall upon entrance. The most impressive area is the chain of pools outside with its meandering surrounding streams and some fish, flamingos,a few swans and a some tropical birds. Our room was a garden view overlooking the huge fountain,and we could still see a sliver of the pool and ocean, quite beautiful. We were afraid the room would be really small as some have reported, but we found it was just fine and had plenty of space for all our things. The maid service was very good. You could tell this was a renovated older room, but it was clean,the decor was neutral...our only complaint would be the carpet should be replaced and the screen door seemed dated with its aluminum frame. We choose this hotel because of the price. The last time we were in Kaanapali we stayed at the Hyatt ,but we just did not want to pay those prices this time. Here are some of my complaints,which I realize not everyone will agree with... but the hotel is still expensive and its a long way to Maui for most people,so hopefully my review will help some of you decide if this hotel is the right fit for you................... This hotel and the immediate surrounding area is crowded beyond belief ! We arrived around dinner time and we tried to eat at the hotels restaurant Tropica,but we could not get in because a convention group booked the entire room. So,all you have to do is walk outside the hotel towards the ocean and immediatly towards the right is the entrance to Whalers village(a rather generic open air mall) and there are three restaurants,Hula grill,Leilanis and Cane & Taro. All three restaurants had a min. 1 to 2 hour wait. What was worse was the crowd around there... it was like a shopping mall on Christmas eve,bumper to bumper people ! Fortunately, we walked a few blocks to the left and got away from the crowd and ate at an excellent restaurant called Longboards, with nice entertainment too! Now for the pool area....although quite expansive,it still felt a bit claustraphobic. The lounge chairs are no more than 6 inches from each other,so if every chair is being used,you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor. There is a long row of shrubs and a sidewalk that separates the pool area from the beach and ocean, so you really are kind of corralled in that pool area. Lucky for us, the hotel was not booked to capacity and we always managed to find a lounge chair. There are two kind of hotels....one where parents bring their kids, and one where kids bring their parents...this hotel is the latter. Kids were running around wild everywhere ! Even at the breakfast buffet. Lots of strollers too (watch your ankles). Never mind the adult pool,it seemed more shaded than other areas,and the sunny spots were always taken. Some kids in the pool had floats with honking horns on them, for hours you heard honking amongst the screaming..yuk ! Now,this is probably a great place to bring your kids, the parents seemed to love it. We spent more time at the Sheraton black rock on the far end of the beach, an easy walk. Although there were lots of people there also, it felt much more open and you felt like you still had your own space. I could go on and on, and gee, I have! Bottom line is, we had a rental car and had a great time on Maui. Its our fourth time to Hawaii, we've been to all the islands and love them all,they each have there own unique qualities. If you already booked this place and how I described it doesnt seem like its for you, dont panic...its a beautiful hotel anyway,you just have to work a bit at finding your space here. And for a local restaurant,just walk away to the left or right a few blocks and the crowd thins out. I agree with some others that this hotel does not have a strong Hawaiian feel, but hopefully you dont spend all your time at the hotel,get out and really see Maui,its beautiful !

The place is big, so there us a lot to take in. But there will be a smile on your face as you head to the elevators to take you to your room. When we arrived in our rooms we were pleased. They were clean and comfy. As I mentioned - we travelled in the dark - so we didn't really get to see what the ocean/resort truly looked like yet. However, when we woke up the next morning and pulled the drapes back, opened the sliding glass door and stepped out on our patio - we were blown away. It was the most surprising and beautiful sight we have seen. Blue, blue ocean, outlines of the other islands in the distance, palm trees and the maze of pools in the middle of the resort. It was breathtaking! Needless to say, we were really quite pleased. Oh, and I must tell you that most days you can see the blow holes from the whales out in the ocean from your room. Sometimes not very far off. They also liked to jump out of the water in front of our hotel to show off. It was ridiculous how close they were and how often you saw them. Just an awesome sight to see! The hotel food and service were quite good and the pool staff were great. Always smiling, saying hi and eager to get a volleyball game going in one of the many many beautiful pools (there's waterfalls, hidden hot tub and a slide as well). There is also a shopping centre called Whalers a mere 3 minute walk away. You can buy everything and anything there. We rented a car for a day and took a drive around Maui, and again it was breathtaking. There is beaches all along the highway. You can literally pull off to the right at most times and hit a beach. I highly recommend renting a car. Most islands you visit will generally have the poorer area that you have to go through to get where your going - but it's not like this in Maui. This really is just a wonderful place. The whole vibe of the island is not anything like you've experienced before, there is so much beauty to see, the people are super friendly and you could actually seriously see yourself living there! Bottom line, Maui is a place that everyone must go to at least once in their lives. It's a trip of a lifetime and we pray that someday we can return.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prince George, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - terrible rooms\u201d", "Author": "shesmiles_11", "ReviewID": "UR93462806", "Content": "We arrived on Dec 27 and left on Jan 8, 2011.

Our room had a nice entertainment center and the amazing Westin Heavenly Bed. The bathroom products were nice as well, and the hotel always had that subtle Westin green tea scent they put in all their hotels. I do have to mention that the bathroom part of the room was outdated. It needs an overhaul. Fortunately, nothing was dirty as some people have mentioned, just older. They also had a fridge in our bathroom ? and magically two water bottles appeared every day. Great touch! The pools were quite crowded, everyone grabs a chair at 6am and keeps stuff on it all day, so its hard to find a spot. We did manage to always finds chairs, but it took some work. The pools were nice, clean, and fun, though they were quite crowded and a lot of children, I would not recommend it for someone who doesn't like kids. But we didn't mind. The pool service was amazing, very attentive, and some of the best tasting Pina Colodas ever! Way to go! The prices on food throughout the resort were excruciatingly high. We were shocked, $10 for 1/2 a papaya at the restaurant. Poolside food service was expensive. Everything was expensive. The food and drinks were substantially more than they were at the other hotel we stayed at which was a Waldorf Astoria, that shocked me. However, the quality of the food was really good. Not the typical fried rubbish food a lot of beach resorts serve. We got Nachos one day and they had real cheese, not that weird liquid cheese. Also the pool side service was amazingly fast, and constantly refilling our water, and bringing us free pineapple. We used the gym and spa. I have to say the gym was too small for the amount of people there, and we were never able to take any spinning classes, they fill up days in advance. However the facility was nice, perhaps not staying during X-mas would alleviate this issue. The location is great, you can walk down the beach to Whalers Village and go shopping, and there are quite a few better priced restaurants there. The grounds were nice, there is a walk through waterfall, and paths and pools, and a cute little gazebo.

I have been Starwood Platinum/Gold for 10 years and have stayed at many Westin's, Sheraton's and St. Regis Hotels. The Westin Maui's biggest problem is that it is 40 years old. Back in 1970 it must have been truly incredible, in 2010 it does not really compare to some of the other more modern resorts on Maui. Whether you should stay here depends on several things, here are the pros and cons: Pros: Great location right in the middle of Kaanapali Beach 2 minute walk to Whaler's Village which has 3 nice restaurants, shops and a great yogurt shop Best pool on Kaanapali Beach? (my 10 yr old loved it) Good service Good buffet breakfast (though pricey, would be great if your room rate included the buffet) Pretty nice rooms (though small), comfortable beds Short drive to Lahaina and Kapalua Never had trouble parking (don't need to spend extra on Valet) Cons: Small rooms Older hotel (but holding up pretty well) Pool chairs - you have to get up at 7am and put down a magazine & sunscreen (or other similar object) to reserve chairs. If you go down at 10am you will not get a chair when the hotel is near or at capacity Lot's of kids, families and people (not a con if you are one of those families) $25 per day resort fee (includes self parking, fitness center, Internet (their connection was very slow) and 2 bottles of water per day Bottom line, if you want a deluxe 5 star resort, go to the Ritz Carlton, Grand Wailea or Four Seasons. If you want a 3-4 star bustling, kid friendly resort with decent rooms and pretty good service, the Westin is great. If you want it a bit quieter, go to the Sheraton or Hyatt, they are at opposite ends of the beach and get less traffic, they are also a longer walk to restaurants and shops at Whaler's village. If you want beach chairs, reserve them in advance, as they do get booked up. Some people complained that they have to pay for them, but they are not expensive (I think it is $20 a day for 2 chairs and an umbrella), it is supply and demand as they limit the number allowed. If you want pool chairs, send someone down at 7am and reserve some chairs.

It's important to bring locals into a Hawaii resort/hotel - we need to share and support our local artists, many who make a humble living selling their artwork.

Nice view of the beach from the balcony or lying in bed even. It could have been better directly facing but let's face it, not every room is going to have a perfect view :) If you want that, then book it. Just don't complain about the cost. Supply and demand people...supply and demand :) The hotels location is a huge asset. Without a doubt, it's at the best spot on the beach. On the extreme north end of the beach is a Sheraton (part of this chain) with a nice beach as well. Just a little more crowded than I like. Our beach was probably the widest stretch along the beach. Smooth soft sand and various waves throughtout the day. Just be careful wading in. It's got a little more of a drop off than you might expect about 20 feet out. Nothing dangerous, just might catch you off guard :) We walked the entire beach length and as you move south on the beach, by about 3 more hotels, the beach gets very narrow and even rocky. I'm extremely happy we went with the westin instead of the hyatt. The hyatt had almost no beach to speak off (althought the property looked fabulous). Pools are incredible here. Nice water slide (one for the kids as well). Water vollyeball net, water basketball, groto with jacuzzi and waterfalls. Even has an adult pool to get away from the kids. Crowd was mixed here. Not a rowdy crowd or party type place (which I liked) but had a good mix of young and old, familes and couples. Even saw a few singles there. Very respectful group of people. One of the nicest things was that all of the things you might do in Maui happen right here on this beach. Parasailing, snorkle and scuba excursions, whale watch boat trips, etc. The catamarans pull right up on the beach and off you go. The only exception would be kayaking. You'd have to walk down about two properties (not far at all) to rent some kayaks or jet skis. Everything else is right here. Now let me address some of the negatives that I read and spooked me a bit: Resort fees: Every property on the island charges the same fee....deal with it....it's the cost of going to a resort. If you don't like it, don't go to a resort.....I hear Denver has some nice hotels this time of year :) Rooms: The rooms were fine. Nice couch, reasonbly comfy beds, fridge so that you can stock some drinks yourself, good tv channel selection, clean and spacious bathrooms, very attentive housekeeping staff. Anytime I asked for anything, it was in the room within 10 minutes of me hanging up the phone. Cost: There are cheaper places and there are more expensive places. Do what's right for you budget. I found it to be very reasonably priced for the quality of the grounds, amenities and the great attiudes of the staff members. Don't be afraid to book a mountain view room to save some bucks if you need to. You shouldn't be spending that much time in your room at a place like this anyway :) Parking: This one had me spooked. I expected parking hell. I never had a single problem parking. Always had plenty of empty spaces and it's very easy and convenient to park. Don't waste your money on valet.....the lot is 200 ft from the front entrance. Pool and lounge chairs: This one I just can't believe someone complained about. There was neveeeeer and issue getting pool chairs. I don't think I ever even saw the pool busy enough to keep me from going....and I hate people hahahaha. Tons and tons of pool chairs easily available. Pool is open until 10 and most people are finished with it by 5 p.m. so it's almost a private pool at that point. Good seperation between the different parts too. Beach chairs: Rent the beach chairs...well worth the whopping 5 bucks for the ENTIRE day......you can get 2 chairs AND and umbrella for 30 bucks for the whole day......well worth it. If you can handle the sun without the umbrella, you're into it for 10 bucks for two people to have 2 nice comfy chairs placed on the beach for you. I saw some complaints about cobana rental prices??? Not even sure why you would rent one of these....they're not even on the beach. Although they do have some mini cabana type things kinda on the beach......but they were all right next to each other......and as I mentioned...I hate people hahaha Short of it is rent a couple of chairs and maybe an umbrella...you'll love it. Ohhhh...I almost forgot.....if you've got the inclination, they may offer you a tour of one of their time share properties up the beach. Doesn't matter if you're interested in it or not, if you can handle loosing 90 minutes of your day it's well worth it. They'll give you a $100 credit at the hotel AND a coupon (I think it's a coupon) for 50% off of your next stay at a starwood property!!! We got busy and never made it and I'm sort of kicking myself for that. 50% off of any hotel stay is fantastic....... Overall, definitely one of my favorite hotel expereinces so far. Good for young or old, couples or families.....just bring sunscreen :)", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice Family Hotel with amazing location\u201d", "Author": "Jeanjavert", "ReviewID": "UR89704346", "Content": "Check in was fine. Our room was deluxe ocean view with a great view. We could hear the elevator and the carpet had a few bumps in it but who cares? The lanai door did a good job soundproofing the trucks at Whalers Village. Nice to be next door to it. We got every 3rd night free and free breakfast. The parking does have small slots BUT the last two rows by the tennis courts are a good size so just use them. The beach is AWESOME. So are the pools. If you have kids this is a huge plus. The hamburgers at ONO are great.\u00c2\u00a0 Yes they hit you up for a timeshare presentation but they are very polite about it. Just say no and that's the end of it. The luau was a lot of fun. It is table service. They bring a course and put it on a lazy Susan. The show was very good. We had a premium table which was nice. We never had problems with the staff. They were nice to us. If I may? Treat them like people, not staff. Ask them how they are, smile! Also, you came to Hawaii. Learn to run on Hawaii time. I think this is huge. Go with the flow and you'll be fine. RELAX. This is a family hotel. Lots of kids. Know this up front and make your decision accordingly. We were there over Thanksgiving and we just never had this problem with no lounge chairs or Lineups at the buffet. Yes it is busier towards 9 or 10 but it's not a crisis. See above about relaxing. The resort fee is what it is. Nobody likes it, every hotel seems to have it. Load up on the waters and coffees and shampoos in your room. You paid for them! Wireless Internet is a little slow and spotty. Are things pricey? Duh, this is Maui. Maui is pricey. Load up on Costco and K mart goodies. The Resort Aspect? There is an activity hut by Ono restaurant and activities are posted in the lobby. Your kids can feed the koi fish in the lobby. Just ask about it. Honestly the pool, waterfall and slides and beach do a great job amusing kids of all ages. Shout out to specific staff: The 10th floor cleaning staff always asked for my room key when they were cleaning my room and I came in. THANK YOU. I appreciate the security. Carlito, Alex and Melinda at Ono were awesome. So good to my son. Carlito fixed our wobbly table without being asked. Thanks! Brandy at the front desk lent me scissors and tape. Mahalo! Another lent me an ink pad. The older gentleman at the Koa store was very friendly and kind. Danny from the bell staff volunteered to take our picture for us. That was a huge deal for us. Small kindnesses are everything. I am sure the front desk staff has heard the same questions a thousand times. Their job however, is to act like they have never heard it before and help us without making us feel silly for asking us which one of them did. I will refrain from naming the individual. To sum up? Get a deal, ask for the Beach Tower on a high floor away from the elevator. RELAX. Be nice to people. Be aware this is a hotel that is big with families. The pools are great for kids. Park in the last two rows for a bigger spot. if there's a problem don't freak out and just try and get it dealt with. I will stay here again.

The accent is on HOTEL. The rooms were terrible, dark, small and rather dirty - not resort caliber at all - just \"hotel.\" Nothing in the room spoke of Hawaii - it could have been a room anywhere, in any city. We had connecting rooms (one King, the other double Queen w/ a pull out sofa, ocean view (IF you turned your head to the right). Three teenagers in one room. Pity my poor baby on the horrible pull-out bed. Stinks to be #3. Looking out of window was shocking - our view was of the other wings of the hotel. It is institutional, blocky, dated, and very unattractive. We were in a room that did not have a view of either sunrise or sunset. Looking down was a great view of the huge and lush pool area. Excellent pool. The lobby, restaurant, common areas, and pool grounds were fantastic. RUN to the adult pool if you do not have kids. Coming from the East coast - I could not sleep the first morning and crawled out onto the lanai (aka teeny tiny terrace) at 5:45 AM. I was SHOCKED to see numerous people and MANY little children making their way to pool lounges. (My kids are in late teens and met no one - most here are under 10). I decided I had better go and stake a claim for my family of 5. All chairs were filled by 7:30 AM. Hello? This is a vacation? That was my daily ritual, get up early to get a group of chairs together at the adult pool, hopefully w/ a sliver of shade. I stayed at the chairs for an early coffee and a chance to read quietly. My family showed around 8 or 9. EVERY DAY I noticed chairs that were \"reserved\" by 6 AM (people put towels, magazines & books on lounges to hold a spot), but the people did not show until NOON - or later! Once or twice, hotel employees placed little cards on the unoccupied but \"reserved\" chairs asking them not to do this, but they did nothing concrete to stop this annoying practice. Daily, I witnessed hapless couples wandering to the pool area around 9 or 10 to have absolutely no place to sit as half the lounges were \"reserved\" yet unoccupied. The looks on the faces of the honeymoon couples were tragic. There were very few lounges on the beach (due to local laws, not hotel rules), so I stood in the morning queue to get towels and try to reserve a beach chair. I asked on Sunday and could not get one until THURSDAY! And they charge for them, and the umbrellas. This really is a pool hotel, not a beach resort. But do visit the beach, it is lovely and far better than the beaches at the other resorts, which are sometimes non-existent, and the water is warmer than the pool water. Be prepared for lines everywhere - to check in/out, for coffee, for towels, even in the morning for the breakfast - when there plenty of open tables. I did a lot of research on Luaus. Wanted the full experience, but not the cheesy, junky kind. The one at the hotel was pretty good. Good music, great dancing, excellent fire show and not embarrassing at all. Food was not terrible and it was table service, not buffet. We were told we could get more of anything we wanted, but it didn't work like that. The meal was rushed, waitstaff hard to find. Drinks were so watered down that the waitstaff would give you two if you asked for one! Be prepared for the aggressive photographer as you walk in. I was literally grabbed and man-handled into place for the obligatory family shot in front of the lovely backdrop. Hotel is within walking distance of a few decent restaurants and a good shopping \"mall\" with an expensive but convenient mini-mart type store. The concierges were terrific. Bartenders were crabby and wine by the glass was terrible. Hawaii is fantastic. This hotel is not. Westins are really mid-market hotels, despite the cost.

We have stayed at this resort a number of times and always loved it. It is still a beautiful resort, great location, great buffet breakfast, great pool and water slide. However... Our reservation was for an Ocean View room. We arrived at 4:00 PM and were told that all of the rooms overlooking the pool and ocean were taken and that we would be put in a room on the end of the building, where we would be able to see the ocean. We expressed our displeasure but agreed to go look at the room (Room 854). The balcony of the room looked directly at the Kaanapali Alii resort, about 50 yards away. The ocean was off to the right. However, the right side of the balcony is a solid wall from floor to ceiling all the way to the railing. So, if you leaned over the railing, and looked over the rooftops, you could see the ocean from the balcony. We returned to the lobby and told the woman at the desk that we were not taking that room. She explained to us that the room was considered Ocean View in her computer, as if that somehow made the view spectacular. We asked that she or a manager come up to the room with us, stand on the balocny, look us in the eye, and tell us that it was an Ocean View. That didn't work. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that there were none available. Then, she tried again to talk us into taking the same room. We explained that we would sleep in the lobby until they found us an Ocean View room. Then, a manager magically was available. He began the conversation by saying, \"We are 100% full\", as if that somehow relieved them of their commitment to give us an Ocean View room. We repeated that we would sleep in the lobby until they found us an Ocean View room, either at the Westin or at one of the other resorts. Then, within a minute, we were given a real Ocean View room.

The experience was very good overall. We were on the Starwood Preferred 9th floor in a mountain view room in the Ocean Tower. It was on the small side. Had a king bed and enough room to set up our daughter's inflatable mattress on the floor (which we packed in a duffle bag). The room was comfortable but crowded with the three of us, but we were hardly in the room except to sleep and eat lunch a few times. The LCD TV had excellent picture quality. The armoire and dessers were sufficient for all our clothes. The bathroom was with the sink open mostly to the room and toilet and tub/shower in a private room, which made noise for my family when I was up early getting ready shaving. The housekeepers were very friendly and accommodated requests for blankets and sheets for the inflatable mattress. They even left us about 5 extra towels each day without our asking and that was appreciated. The rooms were actually fairly quiet except one night the wind was howling throught the closed sliding door when it was particularly windy. The elevators were quick and we hardly waited more than a minute each time. The pools were great, We barely went to the beach as my daughter preferred to swim in the pools. We loved the waterslides. The beach had a strong undercurrent in the water, so we were fine with staying in the pool. No problems getting a chair at the pool, but I hardly used that either. The pool water was on the cooler side but definitely was heated as I could feel warm water coming out of the filters. The poolside service was expensive but the food and drinks were good. The same menu was at the bar and my daughter could eat with us for free there. We thought the breakfast buffet was enjoyable too, And fortunately it was included in our room rate. The staff throughout the hotel were always friendly and helpful,especially the housekeepers and the pool attendants.. The concierge did try to sell a time share preview, which we declined. The parking lot fills up after dinner and the hotel puts up a sign that valet parking will be complimentary and it was mostly except for twice they still put the charge $15 on our bill, but they did correct it when I asked the front desk clerk to do so. We bought some supplies at Safeway in Lahaina, about 5 minutes away by car and used the mini-firdge to the max. This helped save money on lunches. Dinners were at restaurants. We liked them all: Duke's, Hula Grill, the old Lahaina Luau, Kobe Grill, Maha (great sunset dining in Lahaina), even the chinese restaurant next door at Whaler's Village. Having the Whaler's Village next door was a huge asset with shopping and the ABC store nearby for more sunscreen and clothing and a few gifts. I would definitely return, but would probably splurge for a bit larger room if possible next time. We chose the King room over the 2 doubles because who wants to sleep in a double on vacation for a week?! And my 4 year-old does not care if she sleeps on an inflatable mattress.

There are a nice selection of restaurants, as well as a shopping area, Whaler's Village right next to the hotel. Everything is very pricey-but it is Hawaii, this has nothing to do with the property itself. A hot dog is $7 at the pool but again, you will pay that everywhere you go in Hawaii. The rooms were very clean, ours was a tad small, but you do not spend much time in the room at all. You can walk down the beach to black rock and have great snorkling. The only two things that I was dissapointed in was that the hotel only has 8 beach umbrellas and two were broken, so that left 6 available, with probably 1500 or more people staying at the hotel? I would suggest buying an umbrella and taking it with you if you wanted to have shade on the beach. Also, the pool water is so cold, that you can't be in longer than a few minutes. It is pretty much like ice. I would say it was too cold to be refreshing-it was almost painful. All in all, though a great hotel.

SPG Platinums get raked by $25 Resort Fee\u201d", "Author": "PDXStocks", "ReviewID": "UR85371220", "Content": "I'll start with the positives. The pool area is gorgeous though not as nice as the Marriott down the beach. But it is nice and the pool staff are quick and efficient even though the drinks are lacking. Also the location is wonderful. Any hotel you pick on Kaanapali Beach wins in the category of great location. Now for the rest of my thoughts. No suite upgrade for this Platinum member. I asked and it was flatly denied. Furthermore, what do I get for the mandatory $25 resort fee? Is it the in room internet which I get for free, based on my status, at any Starwood property? Is it the two bottles of water or the local paper? Those too are standard at Starwood properties with my status. Maybe the value is in getting to use the workout facility which is also a benefit of being a platinum member. I did benefit from free self parking, so that is one benefit I received. In a nutshell, I think most guests and especially the Platinum members who are already receiving most of the mentioned benefits are getting a good screwing from Starwood. It's all about money folks. When you check in the agent will open a map of the property and then show you the automatic $25 resort fee that will be added to your bill. It states, \"In a world where life is sometimes too complicated, we are making things a little easier. In response to suggestions from our guests, Westin Resorts has eliminated several incidental charges in favor of a single resort charge.\" Hogwash. How stupid do they think their guests are? Do they think we buy this crap? Just admit it Starwood. Your revenue goals for Hawaii are down. In this economy guests arrive at your resorts but they don't spend as much as they did previously and rather than increasing the room charge which would cause occupancy to possibly fall further, you institute this \"resort charge\". Lucky me, I'm staying on a 1/2 price hotel offer so I only have to pay $255 plus taxes to stay in a very dated hotel, the former Maui Surf that is at least 30 years old. I believe $255 is more than a fair charge for the quality of room I received. And now I get to pay a resort charge for a bunch of \"amenities\" that are already comped to me as a Platinum SPG member. If you want to know what I mean when I say \"dated\" you need only read the other guests reviews. This will be my last trip to Hawaii where I stay in a Starwood property with a mandatory resort fee. I'm not biting. And I'm not stupid. I don't need the extra check-ins for my Platinum status and as a traveler who spends over 100 nights each year in various hotel properties my standards are somewhat different than the Maui Westin. That said, it will be fun to challenge myself and find properties in Hawaii that don't charge the resort fee. Many properties are jumping on the bandwagon to bump up revenues and to me it's insulting.

Booking: * We booked a promo that entitled us to a 3rd night free, daily buffet breakfast, and a room upgrade (if available). We wanted an ocean view room and after contacting Starwood were advised to book the partial ocean view as October would not be too busy and we would have no problem being upgraded to ocean view at check-in. Check-In: * Arrived at the hotel mid-afternoon and it was a bit of a zoo out front and at the check-in. My initial impression was, \"Nice hotel and lobby, but I feel like I am in Vegas, not Maui\". Especially after already spending 10 days previously at other locations with more hawaiian feel to them. * Waited in check-in line for 15 mins and was advised we were in a partial ocean view on 10th floor of ocean tower. Asked about our upgrade and was told it was not possible as hotel is fully booked. Asked her to show me where our room would be and was advised it was a side facing room looking out to the ocean. Room #1: * Went to our room and we were on the 10th floor looking out over the parking lot facing the hills. Was it partial ocean view? Sure, if you went out on the little deck, looked around to the right over the golf course and some other hotels, there about a mile away was the ocean down by the Hyatt. Same story as others have complained about with this hotel. Room #2: * Called the front desk and asked for a manager. A very helpful lady did find us a room on the 4th floor facing inward. However, the room directly faced a very large tree. But we did have a nice little sliver of ocean view between the tree and the other tower. Ahh, $420 a night well spent in paradise! * Each morning and evening around sunset we also were able to have an interesting experience with the local wildlife. What sounded like hundreds of birds would swoop into the big tree and have a little party. While extremely annoying, it was kind of an interesting phenomenon. Pool: * The pool is probably the best thing about this hotel. It is fabulous and winds around the tropical grounds. Despite our challenges, we still enjoyed lounging around the adult pool every day. Ask what the drink special of the day is and you can save $3-$4 off the regular price. Service around the pool was always very good. * It can be challenging to find space at the pool, especially the locations with umbrellas or close to the pool. You just have to be patient and keep working your way closer as spots open up. This can take some time though as there are typically lots of great spots just sitting there idle as people have reserved them with towels. This is not allowed, but there is no enforcement, so it happens pretty regularly. Spa Services: * Wife enjoyed a very nice massage at an outdoor setup near the pool. Rates were reasonable and she also was able to enjoy the spa inside after for awhile. Parking: * After reading prior reviews, I was expecting some very tiny parking spots. However, it wasn't too bad. Yes spots are tight, but if you back in, it is not too tough to get in there. * Finding a space is another thing though as they go very quickly (as early as the aftenoon). But they will valet for free when this happens. * It's also very easy to get blocked in as the valets will double park behind you. I had a tee time one morning for 7 up at kapalua and let them know in advance I would be leaving my spot # early and didn't want to be blocked. I was assured it would be no problem, but sure enough I wen't out there and was blocked in. Not a big deal, but i had to waste 10 minutes or so trying to get them to move the car in my way. Breakfast: * Buffet is a nice to have if it comes as part of your package. Lots of variety and a great omelette station. But I wouldn't want to pay the $33 per person or whatever the ridiculous amount is. We stayed at the Hotel Wailea earlier in our trip and missed the simple continental breakfast they offered. Conclusion: * We still had a good time and enjoyed the pool, but we won't be returning to the Westin. We were concerned by some of the poor experiences expressed by other reviewers and unfortunately we also had similar problems. * While management did try to resolve our room issue, in the end we did not receive what we were promised. This is especially annoying given I expressed this concern when booking and was assured it would not be an issue. * I cannot recommend this hotel as there are simply better values out there. ** Check out my other reviews for Hotel Wailea and Fairmont Kea Lani for comparatives.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cBed bugs!!!\u201d", "Author": "utbeef", "ReviewID": "UR84845070", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here on two separate occaisions. The first time here was in 2005, and again in February 2009. We absolutely love the resort's location, amenities, pools, restaurants, and super friendly staff. The only problem (and I consider it a huge one), came after our third night there. We awoke that morning, and I noticed something scurrying across our mattress. I got up and switched on the lights while my wife kept her eyes on it. I had seen news programs that spoke about the growing problem of bed bugs in the hotel industry, and I immediately suspected the worse. I then grabbed a Ziploc bag, and corralled the bug into it. I took the bug with me downstairs to the lobby. I feared that if I simply showed management the bug, they'd try to argue that it was not a bed bug. So instead, I went to the hotel's computer room, and googled bed bugs. I printed the photos of bed bugs which totally matched the one in my Ziploc. I then spoke to management while showing them our bug. To my surprise, they did not act defensively about it. They acknowledged that bed bugs are a growing problem, and their hotel was not immune. They agreed to launder all of our clothing, and moved us to an upgraded room. I don't know of anything else they could have done, however I suffered insomnia for the remainder of our stay. Every time I would lie down at night, I constantly felt like something was crawling on my skin. I know my mind was playing tricks on me, but considering the circumstances, it is understandable. After leaving Maui, we went to the big island and stayed at the Royal Kona resort; which was a separate nightmare in its own right. Thanks to our uninvited roommates at the Westin Kaanapali Resort, I can no longer stay in hotel beds without the thought of bed bugs racing thru my thoughts. I would still recommend this hotel to someone due to the fact that I realize some things are out of their control. Before this incident, this resort was one of our all-time favorite places to stay.

Having said that, yes, there are some annoying flaws. But rather than turn a 5 star review into a negative tirade, I would rather mention them all later in the review and focus on the what makes this an excellent resort. Let me say right up front that the best value is clearly using Costco vacations. Buffet breakfast, rental car and an upgrade to the next class of room is included and you will not want to pay extra for any of that as Hawaii is already insanely overpriced (well, it is still America after all). 7 nights in mid October on the 5th floor of the nicer (ocean view) wing ran us about $2450 (more on the rooms to follow) Although the brochures claim an abundance of activities on Maui, should you choose to get your money's worth out of the resort, there is little need to spend more than a day or two away from the area. There's an awesome paved path that runs from one end of the resort area to the other. The beach itself is uncrowded since most people opt for the pool area for their relaxation . For easy snorkeling and very personal encounters with large sea turtles, you can walk 5 minutes to Black Rock Beach located by the cliffs opposite the Sheraton. The picturesque (albeit touristy) town of Lahinna can be reached by shuttle all day or by an easy 7 minute drive. Lahainna features some excellent but pricey restaurants with spectacular oceanside sunset seating, a lot of art galleries and jewelry stores and a banyan tree like you've never seen before. Possibly worth a trip, but all your shopping and food needs can be had right next door at the Whalers Village Shopping Complex. (fast food at the food court is the only inexpensive option-if you want cheap, vacation somewhere else or hit Costco and stock up as soon as you get out of the airport). Although the \"5 star\" resorts are located on the snobby south side of the island next to the gated communities and Rodeo Drive style shops, Kaanapali Beach is easily the nicest stretch of beachfront property on the island. The hotel grounds are beautiful and feature 5 separate pools, including an adults only area which makes this hotel an excellent choice for both couples and families. Not once during our stay was there a shortage of chaises (Keep in mind we were here in October but the hotel was still full due to the 10-10-10 weddings). There is a beach bar with typically overpriced but good drinks and they constantly come around to all pool areas taking food and drink orders. Be warned; the relaxation factor can add up. The down side would be the ridiculously small 7 person Jacuzzi where you will find the younger couples huddled every night discussing how they packed every possible minute of the trip with activities. A fun place to spend the last hour of the evening. The facilities include a very beautiful spa (we didn't get a treatment so can't comment on it-prices are typically expensive) and a spacious gym with more than ample exercise equipment (We don't do that on vacation otherwise it wouldn't be called vacation). There are 3 loud parrots, some koi and a very lonely but adorable black swan that are resident pets. The buffet breakfast is served in the restaurant next to the pools and you are given the opportunity to eat at Tropica, the restaurant overlooking the ocean, if there is space. Coffee is typically weak; bring Starbucks Via's from home or pay 5 bucks for \"Kona Blend\" at the kiosk. More on specifics: ROOMS: We had the whole family together but they all opted for either pool facing (garden view)or parking lot facing rooms due to cost issues.There is an enormous comfort difference. The ocean view rooms are 450 sq feet with large double sink bathrooms and enough room to fell like home for a week. The showers have double heads and they provide 2 free bottled waters every day as well as extra small touches like double Starbucks style cups for the average but adequate Kona coffee that is brought to the room every day. Furnishings are contemporary and modern with nice Hawaiian pictures, a full size desk, couch and balcony with an idyllic view (see pictures). Go out at sunrise and enjoy the birds. Only downside: ocean view rooms face Whalers Village and you will hear delivery trucks in the overnight and early AM; however, the soundproof factor is excellent- we heard zero neighbor noise from next door, outside or above with the balcony door closed. Apparently, you can cut some of the resort fee by requesting every other day maid service but we don't stay at hotels to come back to a smelly unkempt mess. Beds are VERY comfortable, but pillows could be firmer. LG flat screen TV's are excellent; safe size is big enough for large laptops; Wi-Fi connection is average speed and you need to log on each time, kind of annoying. But for the rip-off resort fee, you should try to get something out of it. We visited the parents rooms- smaller rooms are tasteful ,but too claustrophobic for me; feels like a Super 8 that charges Plaza Hotel rates. PARKING: Is a disaster and the worst part of the resort-Small self-park lot with room for about 20% of hotel capacity. When there are no spots, (almost always) you give it to the valet. They claim it's free, but CHECK YOUR FOLIO BEFORE checking out- We were charged $14 a day but they reversed the chagres with no problem. They should invest in an expansion-the frustration is ridiculous after a long day of island hopping. SERVICE: All staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly; much different than Kauai; mostly white staff that seem to work to a higher standard than other islands. They do give you a \"free gift\" (tote bag) and try to interest you in standard timeshare crap but unlike Mexican all-inclusives, it's not mandatory to attend any sessions. Just ignore it. An additional unknown charge on our bill was removed promptly and request for coffee, pillows etc immediately acknowledged. BUFFET BREAKFAST & DINING OPTIONS: Buffet is good but nothing spectacular; paying for it individually every day would be insane (almost 30 bucks per person). Standard fare of eggs, pastries, French toast/waffles, cereal, fruit (could be better considering it's Hawaii) and bacon/sausage/hash brwons (all greasy and tasteless). Omelet station and fresh smoked salmon are the standouts. Didn't eat at hotel restaurants but prices are typically overpriced. If you get the Costco package, your vouchers allow you to eat at any of 5 different resorts. DO NOT TRY THE SHERATON-the difference is night and day and it shows-their staff is overweight and barely speaks English, the food is cold and stale, you wait almost 15 minutes and the clientele that stays at the hotel is clearly a social class below the Westin crowd. Dinner choices: We ate at Roy's, 5 minutes north of resort; excellent but expensive- also ate at Cane and Taro's in Whaler's Village- hint: 20% off entree if you order before 6 PM (but then they tack on 18% tip which is more than they deserve for the good but unspectacular service) Excellent fresh fish through all the pricey restaurants. Make reservations for any trendy place after 5:30. We also tried Hula Grill, pan-Asian -2 minutes away -with entire family. Again, excellent macadamia crusted fish but expect to pay almost $80 for 2 if you have alcohol and appetizer. Same goes for most Lahiana restaurants-try Aloha Mixed Plate for basic but average island fare (\"plate lunch\" which means a bit of the cheapest cut of pork or ribs, 2 scoops of white rice and an island delicacy known as \"mac-potato salad\"- at least it's cheap) EXCURSIONS: Try Gemini Charters; they leave right from the pool area-We did a sunset cruise with snacks-better than most, food is catered from the Westin the staff is very attentive. Day snorkel and fishing trips are very pricey and that's why I liked Kauai better for self day-tripping. Refused to get up at 2 AM to see the sunrise on Haleakala but highly recommend a drive to the summit-takes about 90 minutes and well worth it. Didn't see the need to drive to Hana when paying so much for the resort and will take an entire 12 hours to do properly. Skip the Kona Botanical Gardens, they charge $10 and my back yard is nicer. Other choices include a Sugar Museum, Plantation Tour and local Winery, none of which struck me as spectacular. I beg to differ with the brochures that rave about how many great things there are to do other than the beauty of the resort area. I tried Zip lining- $187.50 per person for EXACTLY 4 1/2 minutes. The other 3 plus hours are spent carrying your line, watching others come down and chatting with the guides about how they love Hawaii but all have to work 3 jobs to live there. Fun but IMHO, an absolute waste of money Instead, do it in Costa Rica or Panama for $40. Drove one day to \"Big Beach\" on the south part of the island. Touted as one of the nicest, this beach is nothing spectacular and looks like any California coast beach. Drive to the end of the road and take an awesome short hike on lava rocks instead (about an hour from the resort). Maui roads are very well paved and drivers are not like in Maine (or Kauai)- they drive the limit or faster. Wind is absoultely unbearable in the central part of the island so don't be discouraged when you get off the plane. Some days are better than others. We had 2 windstorm but warm days followed by 5 perfect 82 degree days and no rain. RESORT FEE: Absolute BS but every major chain hotel now charges it. Feels like robbery and you get absolutely nothing; Wi-fi is free at most Best Westerns, parking is a joke anyway and those that use the gym on vacation, well, all the power to ya. $25 a day PLUS tax; only good part: Hawaii state tax is low at under 5%. But not worth looking elsewhere because they all do it now. LUAU: Although usually cheesy, \"Drums of the Pacific\" nightly at the Hyatt, was very entertaining; only a 7 minute walk. Food is better than expected- typical fare of salads, kalua pork, fish and chicken. For an extra 10 or 12 bucks, you can opt for \"Preferred Seating\" which means you go in after the \"VIP Seating\", (which is a total rip-off and all you get is to be 3 feet closer to the stage and eat 5 minutes sooner for 12 bucks more). Professional production company makes the show kind of like Cirque DuSoleil for the Islands. The fire-juggling will entice the kids and everyone had a good time; watered down drinks suck (of course) but are included for the approximate 90 dollar cost so go crazy. 3 of the other options are the same company anyway so I recommend this one. SUMMARY: Only the \"W\" chain ranks higher than Westin on Starwood's hierarchy. At this Westin, you get the extra 1/2 star without having to stay at the most expensive resort on the island.

The room was large and well appointed nice bathroom and twin head shower. The kids slept on the sofa bed which is OK for young kids, but not good enough for adults. It is worth noting that the room is looking old in some areas; the carpet is a bit stained and baggy, and the sofa bed had a few stains. Not as good as a hotel of this class should have. The location is really unmatched, nicely in the middle of the beach and only a 5min walk to the 'blackrock'. This is honestly one of the highlights. Blackrock is a rocky point that goes out to see in front of the Sheraton and the snorkelling around it is excellent, we saw a turtle there which was amazing.

I'm used to room service charges, but the Westin was outrageous. A 20% gratuity auto-added to the bill in addition to a $7 delivery charge.

We walked past the Marriott and Hyatt where the beach was almost non-existent. -It's next to Whaler's Village shopping center which has 3 restaurants and a tiny food court for those who don't want to eat only at the hotel. (Avoid Cane & Taro, overpriced and the food wasn't even tasty). We didn't have a car and were glad not to have rented one. -The outdoor space is well maintained (lobby, pool area, and restaurant). -Great breakfast buffet if included in your hotel package, otherwise it's way overpriced at around $27 per person. Cons: -The rooms need renovating already (I believe it was last renovated in 2007) and are the tiniest rooms I've seen. -Horrible musty/stale smell when you walk into the room due to the a/c. We actually thought the room was a smoking room. -The tub has a slow drain...better call engineering right away. -Service was spotty from completely indifferent (front desk) to helpful (some of the restaurant servers). -The front desk needs an attitude adjustment, it's as if you're bothering them when you go there. They're definitely lacking customer service skills. They have one person dedicated to the Japanese tourists who refused to wait on the person in front of me (even though there was 3 of us in line and only 1 other receptionist).

Joven at the front desk was great in helping me choose just the right room that faced directly toward the ocean. It was perfect except I wasn't able to get a King Bed. But the two Queen Beds worked fine. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The ocean front is readily accessible through the hotel gardens, pool areas, restaurants etc. I was there during an off season and there were very few children. The hotel is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I got several spa services over a two day period and the spa was clean, with all the amentities and the staff were great. The beach area is pristine and there's a lot to do in the area. Shopping at Whalers Village and Front Street in Lahaina was fine for my needs. The restaurants at the hotel, along the board walk and in Lahainai were great. What else can I say? I loved, loved, loved this place. I hope to return to Maui and if I do, I won't even bother to investigate other hotels. I will save my money and stay at the Westin. It was very pricey and that is the biggest downside, but I had a ton of AmEx points so I didn't have to come out of my pocket for most of it. Nevertheless, whatever the cost in the future, I'll stay here again. Believe me, it is worth it. As a female traveling alone I felt very comfortable at the Westin.

First of all, the room descriptions are fraudulent. I reserved the partial ocean view room thinking we would have a decent view for our one of our honeymoon stays. Instead, we were stuck in a room facing the road with a balcony overlooking the parking lot. The only \"ocean view\" about it was a fraction of a glimpse of the water stuck between two buildings only after walking to the very edge of the balcony and straining your neck around a 90 degree turn. After complaining to the front desk, we were told that this was what they considered a partial ocean view, but after explaining what the term \"fraud\" meant, they promptly gave us another room. Problem solved? Not even close. The new room looked clean, but after we unpacked, we discovered that the toilet was completely soiled. Since we were so tired from moving around, we just called the front desk to clean the room again. When we got back to the room, we discovered the a/c had a hideous mildewy smell. That wasn't a problem, thanks to the fact that the thermostat broke after being on for only a few hours. Although the hotel engineer came in and fixed it, he said all the rooms have the same nasty smell from the a/c. We got another treat the next morning when we discovered the shower drain was nearly completely clogged. Standing in stagnant hotel drainage is nothing fun let me assure you. By far, however, the worst part of the stay was the paper thin walls. I am not kidding when I say you will hear every single conversation from both rooms next door. Thanks to the poor insulation and connecting room doors, we were up all night from crying kids on one side and obnoxious partiers on the other. When I complained to the front desk, all they said was to call again when it happens, and security would knock on their door. After explaining that one of the rooms was from a crying baby, she happily reported that they were checking out that day. What about the other side? Thanks alot. Overall, this was by far the worst experience we had of the 3 hotels we stayed at while on our honeymoon. The pool, shops, and restaurants in no way make up for the nightmare room experience. I would suggest any serious traveler avoid this hotel and go up the road to Kapalua. If you have to stay in Kaanapali, avoid this overpriced glorified holiday inn.

From the lush tropical vegetation to the flamingos lounging in the hotel lobby pond, the hotel grounds truly transported you to a picturesque getaway spot.

The patios provided the perfect opportunity to kick off your shoes and enjoy the sunset and luau show below (which, I'm told, is one of Maui's best). My one main complaint was the service, which was at times spotty and indifferent. We encountered a few staff members who seemed bored or occasionally even irked by asking them questions or even to have our order taken at one restaurant. This does not apply to the whole staff, but I would mention that I seemed to encounter the annoyed-employee on more than one occasion.

First of all, the resort is old - I recommend staying in the Beach Tower, where the rooms are newer and larger. When we checked in, we found our initial room had not even been cleaned, so we had to wait 2 hours for another one. The manager said he \"upgraded\" us - basically our next room was a better view, same size, in the Beach Tower. We did receive shell lais upon our arrival, and the lobby area is beautiful with flamingos and waterfalls. Our kids, ages 15, 12, and 5, loved the pool and beach areas. Black Rock was quite close with good snorkeling. As others have said, you do need to claim a chaise by the pool early ( we fortunately could do this since we stayed on East coast time). We ate one meal at the poolside bar and grill which was ok and expensive. Most of the time, we dined next door at Whalers Village (Hula Grill or the food court which was perfect for kids). I recommend buying snacks,drinks, and sunscreen at Walmart near the airport prior to driving to the hotel. We also found a Whole Foods near the airport which had great sushi! Also, there is no need to rent or buy boogie boards, ice coolers, or beach chairs - we were able to get all these items at the bell desk from other families that had left them there! Also, rather than spending $10 per drink at the hotel, we bought liquor and wine in Whalers Village at the ABC store. The fitness area was quite standard, and I did not have any spa treatments.

The staff at the Westin's spa were indifferent when I went to preview the facility so I spent 5 hours and a lot of $ at the spa at the Ritz instead, (who by the way had no long appointments available so they brought in extra staff to accommodate my wishes - now that's great service!).

We have been to Maui 6 times in past 7 years, usually staying in Wailea. We picked the Westin in Ka'anapali primarily because it is a Starwood property and I used SPG rewards to book the room. Overall, this is a a slightly below average Westin. It has above average common areas, the pool area and the location. It is mostly below average on service, more like a Sheraton than a Westin. First the positives: 1. Good location in the middle of Ka'anapali that is next door (walking distance) to the Whaler's Village shopping center, with a complimentary shuttle to local shopping and the other Starwood properties in the area. 2. The pool area with multiple rocks and waterfalls is impressive, with 4 or 5 interconnected pools and a water slide for the kids. Its not as impressive as the Hyatt or the Grand Wailea, but its a highlight especially for children. There is also a koi pond with probably the biggest well-fed koi fish I have ever seen (some of these fish are scary large) -- every morning they hand out fish food to the kids to feed the fish, which is a hit. 3. The O'no restaurant next to the pool is convenient and serves decent food, including the option of smaller dishes. The pork sliders are very good. 4. Nice boardwalk along the beach that extends in both directions. 5. Pool side chairs were not difficult to get.at most times throughout the day. 6. The small refrigerator in the unit (one of those personal sized refrigerators that you see in college dorms) is convenient for storing left overs. Now, the negatives: 1. Checkin left a lot to be desired. When I arrived at 2:15 pm, there were 16-20 people in front of me in line, which was at least a 20 minute wait, and rather ridiculous. They need to add more checkin help when the line gets long. Also, when I asked at checkin whether any upgrades were available, as I am an SPG elite, she responded that I would have to wait until 3 pm to get upgraded (it was 2:45 pm at time!). Are you kidding me? I was not going to go back into that long line. This is the type of thing they would take care of at most Westins I have been to. 2. The rooms are comfortable but small for a Westin. The bathrooms are tiny. 3. I tried to reserve a beach umbrella and chair as soon as I checked in. I was told none were available and I could be put on a \"wait list.\" It turns out they only have 14 umbrellas available for the entire hotel. This falls within the \"what in the world are they thinking?\" category. This is supposed to be a beach resort, and there is plenty of space on the beach, why not offer more umbrellas? Its pretty unbelievable. The staff at the towel desk was pretty unhelpful the entire time: They will not call you if a space opens up, you have to keep calling down there to check if anything opens up. I never got off the \"wait list\" during my entire stay. This was probably the single worst part of my experience as we traveled several thousand miles to come to a \"beach resort\" that does not even offer sufficient beach chairs and umbrellas to its guests. 4. The self parking lot is packed and too small for the number of guests, and the parking spaces themselves are all compact-sized, so if you have a typical mid-size rental car, you will have a difficult time parking if you can get a spot in the first place. To the hotel's credit, the valet offered to park out car for \"free\" because the lot was full (I say \"free\" because you actually pay $25 a day for parking when you are charged for the resort fee). 5. The high speed internet is very very slow. 6. The pool itself is not heated very warmly. During the afternoon, the beach water was actually warmer than the pool. Also, there is no jacuzzi area open for families. 7. At the beach, there is a very steep drop off only 15 feet or so out from the edge of the water, which is much different than Wailea. Its also windier than Wailea. We also took the Westin shuttle one night to have dinner a Pulehu, which is located at the Westin Ocean Villas (a timeshare property).

The real beauty in Maui is in the south of this fabulous island on the way to Hana and beyond. So, why I have stayed in such expensive supposedly one of the best resorts over there on my honeymoon? Nothing more than to be indulged and feel the luxurious peace of mind. Simply, I didn't feel any of these for the following reasons: - Over priced compared to the service you receive (not a value of money at all) - Their service level cannot be categorized as luxurious, but fairly acceptable. - You may have paid a lot of money to stay at this hotel or even paid the triple the price to have an ocean front like I did to enjoy the sunset during my honeymoon stay but don't expect too much. You just paid for your bed and the use of the lift to your room. Everything else has to be paid as extra (same concept as cheap rated hotels). Even for any service that you pay for, there are two categories, the cheap and the expensive one. High class luxurious hotels never charge you extra or categories their services because they assume delivering the best service ever which is not the case in this poor hotel. - The hotel fees that you'll be charged for are nothing more than just using you and trying to milk your pocket. - I was really astonished after traveling 30 hours from my homeland to this resort to stay by the sunset and the beach to still need and paying the most expensive package available at that time, that I still need to pay extra for my shade on the beach!!! ...

I don't know what is the difference between accessing a public beach which normally have have chairs and tables for the public for free and this $475 room per night resort's beach? guess what? you still need to pay an extra $55 for your shade and chair :)). - $25 hotel feel per room per night! For what?? To have high speed internet access in your room, park your car, free bag, free photograph per couple per stay. As if any single star hotel anywhere in the US doesn't provide all these services already for free. This is what you really get. VERY VERY VERY slow free internet access in your room that get's you bored while you're supposed to spend this valuable time at the beach or enjoying the island or simply relaxing! If you want to have a high the real high speed internet you have to pay $10 per day!! ... so why the hell I am paying those $25 hotel feels in the first place??? ... You're allowed to self park your car for free in the self park area where the market car lots are not sufficient for any mid size car to fit it. Even if fits, you can't open the car doors without hitting the car next to you. expect the same to be done to your own car as well. Don't want to risk scratching your car? then valet park it for $15 per day! .. wow .... did I mention that you're entitled for a free photograph??? Guess what, you're entitled just to see this photograph on the computer screen but you have to pay for the print out :))) ... yeah, you've started hitting my ba**ls hard baby :) ... Where is my free bag that was included in the $25 hotel fees??? You'll find a plastic bag (can be used for your garbage) in your room. Although you pay for these $25 hotel fees daily but you'll receive this garbage bag once per stay. - Basic requirements like bath scale, bath slippers .. etc has to be ordered from the room service. exactly like any other cheap hotel. Thank God that I have planed my honeymoon on 3 parts ... I have enjoyed the other 2 plus Maui as an Island. My next visit will not be in a hotel. Or I will choose the cheapest as not to have high expectations that I wont get anyway. By the way escalation process of management is very poor, bear the staff as they have nothing to do with the hotel policies. They hear these bad words everyday from a lot of people like me and you'll do. At the end they have nice beds in outdated old rooms and fabulous view and location by the sunset ... anything else is not even worth mentioning. I highly urge Westin's management to leave this nice location to another chain like Ritz-Carlton, Fairmont or Four Seasons to take care of tourists visiting this area.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonney Lake, Washington", "Title": "\u201cDawn was amazing\u201d", "Author": "MotivationMan", "ReviewID": "UR78240828", "Content": "We travel a ton for business and pleasure, and are a part of the SPG Platinum Preferred membership program.

My biggest complaint about this hotel is the pool/beach situation. You can read plenty of reviews on here about that so I'm just echoing the frustration. Be sure to call the hotel weeks in advance to reserve a chair or cabana on the beach. Otherwise, once you get there, it will all be sold out. They offer very few chairs on the beach which I don't really understand. They could easily add more chairs so there are more options. Beach cabanas are a complete joke for what you pay. They are all right next to each other so there is no privacy. We had a cabana next to the one of the end (#2 I think). A family of 6 had rented the cabana so they were all sharing it and sat there and talked the whole time. Annoying. Also, the cabana staff will not take your food order so do not expect any service for your fee. The only thing they would do is keep bringing you tap water and some chopped pineapple. We were there during peak season and the staff informed me that they were understaffed which is why they wouldn't take our lunch order but the waiter could bring us water. Huh? We had to walk to the bar to order lunch. Again, annoying. The good thing about this hotel is its location. It is walkable to many restaurant and entertainment options which was very convenient.

Check-in was fast and efficient and the desk staff were very friendly. Overall I found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful - what you would expect. Our room was nice, clean, had a nice view, and had a mini-refrigerator - which was nice. The room was small, especially considering we have two teenagers but at least we had two queen beds and we really did not spend too much time in the room anyway. The balcony was also nice but small. We had to pay a $25 resort fee that covered parking and internet. It seemed a bit pricey but at least they were up front about it. And when the lot was full later in the evening they did not charge extra for the valet service. As we got there late in the afternoon we decided to eat dinner at the restaurant by the pool. The food was ok, what you typically expect from a hotel restaurant. The hotel grounds themselves were impressive - from the lagoon with the flamingos to the many pools and the water slide. We had great poolside service for lunch and drinks and though it gets very crowded we must have been lucky as we did not seem to have a problem getting chairs. I will admit the pool area does get very crowded, there is definitely an issue with people \"reserving\" chairs and not using them, and the pool water is cold. The location on the beach is great and I liked how close it was to Whaler's Village. We did some shopping there and had a few meals, even at the less expensive fast food places. What was also nice was how close the Maui Dive shop was. We rented snorkeling gear for 2-weeks and at the end dropped it off at another Maui Dive Shop closer to the other hotel where we were staying later in our vacation. We did the Westin's version of the luau. It was very entertaining, the food was good (though not great), and it was expensive. For the price of the luau they could have included the picture they took upon entry instead of charging another $20. As a Starwood member I did get a 10% discount on the luau. The highlight was the fire dancing. The one complaint I had was how aggressive the concierge was in trying to push timeshares at their sister Westin down the street.

Checking in we were greeted by an amazing woman who I think was named Monica who willingly upgraded us and sent us up a bottle of champagne with a congratulatory message. Our room was much bigger than we anticipated and our view was amazing. We were able to sit out on our balcony and listen to the live music being played in the Whalers Village. Unfortuneatly, we weren't able to sit out on our balcony as much as we would have liked because our room was next to a chain smoking woman, and when we called the front desk to complain, nothing ever happened and if it did it didn't change this womans behavior. Looking around the grounds of the hotel we felt as if we were staying in paradise, the flamingoes and fish in the lobby, the pools, everything was very clean and a sight to see. Upon checking in we asked about our free 4x6 picture and were told where we could sign up for it. When we got to the sign up book we saw that the only day available was the day that we were due to come home, which wouldn't work because you had to wait a day to get the picture and if we wanted it shipped to us it would have cost us $15. We opted to have another guest take our picture in the lobby for FREE. If you would really like to take advantage of the free picture do it as soon as you check in and you MIGHT be lucky enough to get s time slot. We ate lunch one day (shared a plate of $16 dollar nachos) in the poolside restaurant that took up an hour and a half of our time. We sat at our table for a good 20 minutes before we were acknowledged, waited another 10 for our drinks after we ordered them, and another 15 minutes waiting to get a bill so that we could leave. We could have taken that time, walked to the Whalers Village and ate and stopped at the ABC store and bought some drinks and wasted less time. I understand that the attitude in Hawaii is laid back, but come on! You could tell that the servers didn't really care whether or not they did their job well. Apparently they don't work for tips. We also had breakfast buffet coupons as part of our stay. The buffet lines were short, and tables were open but it still took 10 minutes to get sat. The only time that I can say I was truly impressed with the service on the food and beverage end was the Sunday that we were there and there was a Build your own Caipirinha station set up. Those guys were having fun and were genuinely interesting in making our visit a positive experience. Like many others have said the pool areas were amazing, but if you wanted to sit by them you had to fight the crowds at 6:30 in the morning to reserve a chair. There were signs posted saying that it was something that was monitered, but I never saw it enforced. One morning a girl was walking around tagging chairs but nothing was ever moved. Hanging out in the pool wouldn't have been an issue if the pools weren't freezing. Its a good thing we enjoyed the beach! The parking attendants were very pleasant and waived the valet fee when we came back each night which was nice. There is a business center but its more of a kinkos. If you want to use the computer located outside of it you have to pay for the minutes you are online. They don't even allow you to check in for flights for free, you would think that the resort fee would cover that.

We arrived to the hotel late afternoon to find the self parking lot completely full. My concern was alleviated when we were comped all valet fees for any nights when self-parking was full. Westin was very good about this, and I appreciated it. When we checked in, service was quick, friendly and easy - kudos again for a nice job, especially during a busy afternoon check-in. Our first night was uneventful, we enjoyed a nice evening in the happening Ka'anapali area. Our bed was pretty comfortable, but frankly nothing special. We are Starwood Preferred members and paid for \"Partial Ocean View\" which meant we got a 2nd floor corner unit that overlooked the A/C unit of another building, with a big drain in front of our balcony that collected fallen bathing suits/underwear (lots of it), etc. On our first morning, we exited the elevator at 7:30am (on our way to breakfast) to find people scrambling to throw beach towels on pool chairs, which immediately angered me. There has GOT to be a better way than this. As other reviews state, pool chairs are cramped and hard to find (unlike other reviewers, I have no problem with them being in the sun - you're in Hawaii for crying out loud). You basically have to stalk folks that look like they're leaving their chairs to get one. Often times you can only get one chair for two people, then just hang out in the pool. Terrible. Next, we go to breakfast, to find a line of approximately 20 people to sit down for the buffet breakfast. The hostess was working by herself and had lots of writing to do for each party, thus the line. It took 10 minutes to get seated in the breakfast area that was basically empty at the time. Not good service. The view from the Tropica area was a nice touch at breakfast, we thoroughly enjoyed this every morning. Around lunchtime on our first day (a Sunday), we went to the pool and stalked until we got chairs, only to realize we were in front of a DJ who was BLASTING rap/dance music that could be heard from my brother's house in Washington, DC. Seriously, WAY too loud. We moved to the beach to try to avoid this, but still felt the vibration of the music. Had this occurred every day, we would have switched hotels in a heartbeat. I'm a late 20's professional who enjoys to party on occasion, but in my opinion, this type of thing should not be done in a resort that caters to families and honeymooners. My advice - avoid this place on Sundays in the summer (apparently that's when they do this). Maid service staff was amazing, and very personable. She left a great impression in that area and was sure to get us whatever we needed. We really appreciated that. The only time we visited the concierge was to pick up our \"free gift\" - a tacky coffee cup, which was really just bait to get us to the desk so they could try to sell us a timeshare. Seriously, we're on our honeymoon, and you know this, we didn't come there to be sold on timeshares. Overall, a nice hotel with a lot of problems to solve (in our opinion). There are many other hotels in the area that I'd try before returning to the Westin.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "calman", "Title": "\u201cTHIS IS THE BEST RESORT I HAVE EVER STAYED AT.\u201d", "Author": "mrbbman", "ReviewID": "UR75811054", "Content": "When we walked up to the counter at Starwood Resort, the front desk clerk greeted us with a great smile and said welcome to paradise.

The rooms are nice, but be sure to clarify when booking your room what \"partial ocean view\" means. When we checked in we were given two rooms located over the front entrance and when you looked to the very far right you could you see slivers of the ocean between two other hotels. We asked the front desk to be moved to \"partial ocean view\" rooms and were told that these were. However, they did move us to two rooms the next day that overlooked the inside garden/waterfall area and had a much better partial ocean view. The food was very good, but expensive, but it's that way every where on Maui. The staff was all very friendly. We took the scuba lesson in the pool and did the intro dive at black rock--very fun.

We stayed at a budget condo for the first half and were looking forward to pampering ourselves a little bit and this nice resort. While we did really enjoy ourselves, there were some ways in which the resort did not meet our expectations. First, I will list the high points followed by areas in which I think the resort could and should improve. Pros: *Beautiful lobby with flamingos, fish, waterfalls, etc. A great please to just take it all in. *Pool area- Wow! Enormous and diverse with something for everyone. Seats were hard to get, but it you were flexible, we were able to get to 2 chairs and bring them next to each other and any point of the day. I don't think it was as bad as many make it seem, although they may have had large parties. *Location- 5 minutes to Lahaina on beautiful Ka'anapali beach. It really was a prefect location. *Food- the quality of the food we had at \"Ono Bar and Grill\" as well as \"Tropica\" was very good. I recommend the \"Macadamia-nut Encrusted Chicken. I got it twice! *Spa- this was beautiful and Paris does a fantastic deep-tissue massage. One of the best I have ever had. *Room Size- I thought the size of our room (in the Beach Tower) was a good size. The Ocean Tower rooms were smaller. *Westin Bed/Bath- very nice, as advertised. Cons: *Front Desk- When I checked in (and prior to arrival on the phone) I let the Front Desk know that we were on a anniversary trip and asked for any possible upgrade. The woman who checked us in was cold and uninterested about it all and said that she upgraded us to a \"Golf Course View.\" We proceded to our room on the 6th floor of the Ocean Tower. I didn't see any nice green golf course, just parking lot and highway. I was a bit sad to start our experience this way. (We had booked a garden view and would prefer that to the supposed \"upgrade\" of the parking lot.) After returning to the desk we were directed to a woman who was working the Japanese Guest Services counter. She was very friendly, nice and understanding. She worked for a few minutes to change our room to 284 in the Beach Tower. While it was a lower floor room, the view was great of the pool and gardens. When you came out onto the balcony you could see the ocean. *\"Concierge\"- I put the word concierge in quotes because they are annoyed when you ask any questions about directions, reservations and recommendations. The really aren't concierge at all. They are timeshare sales people. They are very pushy and leave you notes to come get free gifts. When you show up for the free gift but aren't interested in the timeshare they are upset. In fact, one woman said, \"Well, OK, I guess you can have your gift.\" Bluntly put, I paid too much money to be offered a free gift and then be lectured about time share sales. It was offensive and Westin should know better. Housekeeping- Housekeeping was poor. The room was barely cleaned. Nail clippings from a previous guest were on the floor upon arrival and remained there throughout our stay. We were not always given our daily waters and service was inconsistant. We caught a cockroach on the last morning too. I wouldn't expect this at a Westin Resort. Parking Lot- the self parking lot is ridiculous. The spots are the smallest I have ever seen. It is dangerous and is begging for dents and scratches. Resort Fee- I know about this fee upfront, but have to say. $25 a day to be able to use the gym, self park and for 2 bottles of water a day, internet and 1 4X6 photo is crazy. The gym, internet and parking should be included in the already high room rate and the water and photo should be for sale like everything else. Service Express- Service Express is a button on your phone that you call for pretty much any of your needs. I had to call it twice. Once because we were not given the water that we were supposed to receive each day and another because I needed a nail file and it was listed as in item that could be provided if needed. Let me say this clearly, there is nothing express about service express. The water took over 2 hours and the nail file took 1 and a half hours. Someone could have told me there was a file in the vanity kit that was already in the bathroom. Restaurant Service- We dined at both Tropica and Ono. While the food was good, the service was slow. Donna, in the Ono, was both slow, uninterested and inattentive. Donald was a better. I hate to be so negative, but I think that if the management and staff were to change some of these things, the resort really would be worth the high cost. It is beautiful and a great place for families with fantastic pools. I do recommend it, but can't do so enthusiastically or highly because of the above concerns.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201c4th time was not the charm...\u201d", "Author": "Mattman08", "ReviewID": "UR74966948", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 2 years and have loved it.

We asked the woman to come back because our son was napping, she got annoyed and said she had to leave at 3 pm. I said ok then leave... I mean really how is that my problem. The next day we had a do not disturb card in the door (again napping child) and she knocked on the door. I was livid. Then she did a terrible job cleaning. The carpets were nasty sticky. The restaurant staff was so slow we sat there for 6 minutes and asked someone to get our waitress who had Been standing at the bar waiting for her drinks for at least 3 minutes, she looked right at us and did not move... We waited another minute and walked out. We walked out of the bar 3 times from lousy service. One day the bellman Aaron literally stuck his empty cart in our elevator as the doors were closing even though there was another one right across the way open and empty. It was a snotty rude move. I don't know what has happened there, it just felt like the staff are all cranky and unhappy. Lastly, getting a seat at the pool is going into mortal combat. Good luck with that.

I knew when I booked this hotel that the rooms would be tight. (Two double beds) We had 4 adults in our room and it was stressful to say the least. No place to put anything, and we constantly had to pick up just so we could relax. I don't think it was possible to fit a rollaway in the room so my two adult children took turns sleeping on the floor. As it was, we payed $500/night for the room. Thank God we had a balcony overlooking the parking lot (mountain view). It was the only peace and quiet we found at the hotel the entire week. The rooms overlooking the pool/ocean had to be loud and had no privacy at all. Honestly I thought summer was a slow time to visit (off season) and I thought the crowds would be light. I was seriously wrong on this one. Someone mentioned the parking lot. I prayed everytime we pulled in that the lot was full so the valet could park the jeep for free, as the spaces were barely large enough for the smallest of vehicles. I did figure out if you want a bunch of extra towels just go down to the left of the valet area. They have a huge supply of them and gave them away freely. This was great for going to the beaches or day trips and of course when we returned we swapped them for clean ones as we constantly ran out of them in our room. If you wanted to relax by the pool you had to get down there by 7 AM to place a towel out there. What a joke. Good thing I didn't care about lying by a pool when the South Pacific was perfect and beckoning!! We met a lovely family the first day that gave us their boogie boards as they were flying home that day. We assured them we would pass them on to another family when we left as well, and it was fun choosing whom we would gift them to that last day:) Everything at the hotel felt like a scam to sell you something. No I am not interested in going to a presentation for your property so I could get a credit for the hotel. The free photo I was promised was a scam to get us to buy a package. The hotel is beautiful so take your own photo and save the time and hassle. The food is very overpriced but then again this is Hawaii and everything is overpriced. I did find a great place in downtown Lahaina called Boss Frogs that rented everything you could use on your trip for less than half the cost of most everything they try to sell you on Kaanapali beach. (Rentals of surfboards, snorkel equipment, golf clubs, etc.) This was the best deal in town. The spa was overpriced and nothing to write home about. Lovely as it was, it was the low point of our trip. Kind of a let down. We had massages in cabanas by the beach. It was unnerving having hundreds of people walking by you while you are half dressed getting a massage... For some reason I had envisioned considerably more privacy than what we encountered... We are gold members and were told we would get upgraded when we arrived if available, but nothing was available. Figures. No lei greeting either, but we got some shell leis another day so no big deal. All in all I would say the front desk was virtually no help whatsoever during our trip. I get better service out of hotels that only charge you $100/night. They must not be hurting for business... Overall, my adult children enjoyed the trip and the hotel so I would say it was a nice vacation. However, I would never give my business to this hotel again. I prefer to be more catered to instead of looked at as one of the masses. It reminded me of Disney during peak season. It lost its appeal because it was so crowded you got no attention, and at the prices we paid I would expect a lot more. Anyone can come to the pool, even though I'm sure it is frowned upon. No one was checking to see if you were a hotel guest or not. I did get a wristband one day but it annoyed me and I removed it immediately. Nobody noticed or cared. I used the slides a few times with no wristband and they never checked.

The neat thing about the Westin is that the Whaler's Village shopping center is right next door. We went there for a quick and inexpensive breakfast almost every day.

The only negatives for the Westin are the smallish rooms and the parking. Regarding the latter, the spaces were extremely narrow and required my family to exit the car while I pulled into the space. Worse, there weren't enough spaces to go around, so we saw a lot of double parking each morning. Good thing we never got stuck behind somebody. We learned to park in the furthest rows to avoid that possibility. But don't let those negatives dissuade you from staying here. We wanted a posh resort hotel, and the Westin does not disappoint. The landscaping is beautiful, and the hotel staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. We would heartily recommend this hotel to our friends.

Tomorrow we are going to the Grand Wailea to try there spa. We also went to a small strip mall spa called Zensations. Read me review it was the best massages my wife and I have ever recieved. Our stay was wonderful and we do not have any regrets or complaints. The hotel grounds are great along with the staff. I will definately return in the future with the kids.

The hotel was beautiful and it was in a great location! We were in the newer tower, and the rooms were great. Plenty of space for 2 of us, and a gorgeous view. You can easily walk to Whalers Village for food and shopping, or down the beach strip to the other hotels. Black rock is just a 2 minute walk down the beach. Lahiana is just a 10 minute shuttle ride, and another great location. We had great service from just about everyone at the hotel. It seemed to be a smooth running operation, which is appreciated at such a busy and family friendly resort. The spa was great too, although smaller than I would have expected. Staff in all departments were friendly and accomodating. We were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade, and a VIP escort to our room. Nice touch. During our entire stay we only ran into one staff member who may be employed by the Villas, who was unfriendly. Beware of the shuttle driver! His name is Maunalani (I think??) and he is a bit crabby and rude. He told one family that if their stroller didnt fit in the compartment that they would have to leave it on the street. Really? He stood out since everyone else had the \"ALOHA SPIRIT\". It didn't change our mind about the resort. We really loved it, and cant wait to go back. The food is great and pretty well priced in comparison to some neighboring restaurants. Will definately recommend this hotel to a couple and/or family. We thought it was great! A few tips for travelers: 1. Get to the pool early as can be expected, chairs go really really fast. If you can afford it, get a cabana. They are $50-$100 depending on each one, and they are worth it! But you have to reserve those early as well. 2. if you book your vacation through a package... GET THE BREAKFAST. The buffet is awesome, but $30.00 per person if you buy it when you get there. We had gotten our breakfast included in our package, and it really was a great deal. Our only real complaint was not about the hotel, but about the family in the room next to ours. They had children who would not stop screaming... and then of course the parents would start screaming at them. Seriously parents, I know you love your kids, but screaming kids at all hours of the day and night can really ruin other peoples trip.

It's the little things that make a stay sometimes. It is expensive here but then this is Hawaii so we weren't surprised. The hotel grounds are just beautiful and very relaxing, but the smell from the flamingo's/pond takes a bit of getting used to. The buffet breakfast is good although again overpriced. They were running a kids meal plan for under 12's for $15 per day which was a great deal, but it ended at the end of June. This could be something they could do more often to encourage families to eat at the hotel. The rooms here are average in size with a small bathroom. We had a mountain view room with amazing views and comfortable beds. The cleaning in the bathroom area could be improved around the tile/grout but on the whole housekeeping were good. We only had one night where it appeared there was a party going on next door to us, but the front desk addressed it immediately and said there wouldn't be any more issues with the people there. We were told the next day that the people were only staying 1 night and were attempting to crowd into one room, not what we expect at The Westin at all. Hopefully they will decline guests in the future wanting to stay 1 night since it obviously attracts people who can't really afford to stay there!

Never left enough towels in the room. We have four of us in the room and they would only leave two towels every time! The parking lot was a big hassle every time.

Food at poolside which is same food at the Ono grill were pretty good. Didn't try Tropica restaurant. Whaler's village just right next door.

The koi, flamingos and swan in the ponds/water were beautiful although sometimes smelled too strong of algae. Made wonderful background for photos. My son also went to the free stargazing and liked that as they looked through telescope. Didn't try any of the lei making sessions for small fees. Location overall was very nice and it was good value for what we got. They also had complimentary limited computer access for printing boarding passes if needed. Didn't take advantage of their complimentary shuttle into Lahaina, since there was free self parking so easy to come and go as we please. Would highly recommend and stay here again.

Everything started with a room mishap. I was told I would get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153King Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room from the 800 reservations operator, but when we arrived at noon on our scheduled day of arrival, we were given a single room with a king bed. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to work for our family of four so after talking with the front desk, we were moved to a room with two doubles and a single sofa bed. I have a boy and a girl and they are too old to be sleeping together so my daughter got stuck with the sofa bed that was literally 24 inches wide and 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21228\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd long (we measured). There is no way an adult could sleep on this. We asked for another comforter to make the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more comfortable and were told there would be a $300 deposit required that they would refund if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it home with us. What? I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to put a deposit down on the other two beds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 After finally tracking down the night manager, at 9pm, we were told that they would fix our room situation the next day. Surprisingly, they did and we were VERY pleased! Still there was a lack of service and a lack of information that haunted us our entire stay. When I called a week prior and talked directly with the concierge, I was told that we would receive a lei greeting upon arrival. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get our 59\u00c2\u00a2 shell leis until our second check-in day. A bummer for my daughter who was so looking forward to that Hawaiian custom. (You can order flower leis, but that is extra.) On my last trip to Maui (at another hotel), we were greeted with cool wash cloths and a glass of POG. I guess those days are over. There are beautiful waterfalls and flamingos and lots of beautiful places to take a family photo at the resort. You are even given one photo free\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if you sign up the minute you arrive. The front desk never told us this and by the time we figured it out, it was too late and there were no more slots available during our stay. We got a shot with our own camera, but we were ready and willing to spend money on this for a professional photo. While at the pool, I was wondering why so many parents were ordering their kids $8 PB&J sandwiches. Is everyone here rich or do they have a secret? Yup, another feature that we missed. There is a new feature called the SPG Kids Pass. It is only $15 a day and includes breakfast at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOno buffet ($30), lunch from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOno Bar & Grill, Sea Dogs or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOno Poolside and then dinner from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOno (with dessert) as well. We figured we spent at least an extra $100 on our daughter that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to, in addition to wasting several of our free breakfast passes on her at the buffet. No one told us about this until our breakfast server did on our last day at the resort. Overall, we had a great time in Maui. How can you not enjoy paradise? It just would have been that much better if we could have enjoyed our resort even more. Here are a few tips on how to make your stay at the Westin Maui a great one: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Write down the exact room type you are to receive and call the front desk in Hawaii to confirm even after you receive your written confirmation. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on the 800 number as it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in Hawaii. Make sure they match. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Print it out the exact rate plan or promotion code that you are applying to your room and take it with you. There are so many different codes and discounts available. Our front desk agent had trouble with ours. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ask about any kids discounts or programs that may be available. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Call the American Express Activities Center at the resort and have them email you a list of activities available before your arrival. This is not on the website. We worked with Stevie and she was wonderful. She made sure to remind us to pick up our forms early so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose our reservations for scuba and parasailing. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 If you have curly hair, bring your own hair dryer. The ones provided don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a low cycle, just high and higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Be aware that there is a $25 resort fee that is charged daily. This covers the self parking (valet is extra), the internet ($10 extra if you want higher speed), the gym, your free photo (if you can get on the list in time), two bottles of water in your room, etc. They should use this extra money to heat their pools and jaccuzi...brrrr. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Be prepared for the BIG sales push to buy into the Westin Villas up the road. Yes, the Westin needs some updating and maybe some better customer service, but we enjoyed ourselves\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hawaii after all!!!", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay in Maui\u201d", "Author": "Isca", "ReviewID": "UR69502691", "Content": "We stayed for 2 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Needs Major Renovations!\u201d", "Author": "Paradise114", "ReviewID": "UR69017650", "Content": "We recently stayed 5 nights at the Westin Maui in late June 2010 to celebrate our Honeymoon. First off, I must say this hotel has a very nice staff. Everyone was very pleasant during the duration of our 5-night stay. However, having said that I must say that this hotel is in need of improvement in many areas!!! We flew in on a Monday morning and arrived at the hotel at around 11:30 am and were told that the check in was not until 3pm. There were no spare rooms to refresh us after a couple long flights,. This was a slight annoyance but we got over it quickly and just let it go. The lobby area was very beautiful, had a beautiful waterfall, and it had a very warm inviting feel. When we finally got our room we were upgraded from a king/terrace view to a partial ocean view. Unfortunately however I was told that the room they selected for me had two twin beds. I unwillingly had to accept considering that this was a special occasion so I relented and just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153went with it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now an issue I defiantly have is that this room was COMPLETELY outdated. The first giveaway is the acoustic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popcorn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ceilings that are found in the hallways and room; I mean most places stopped using this type of ceiling back in the mid 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s! The room we stayed in had no closet; instead they put an armoire in the room, which shrinks the room considerably. The wallpaper in the sink area was peeling, the fire sprinklers were rusted, the balcony needed new paint, and the balcony table had cracked glass. It was just so disappointing! Even the elevator up to the room felt very dated and old. They added some paint to the doors to try and update it, but it still feels out of date. Overall, I mean this is Maui! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying a lot of money to stay at a Westin Resort & Spa. I should have gone down to complain but my bride just told me to let it go, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on our Honeymoon and only staying for five nights. I even earlier asked the very nice lady at concierge which tower was the more updated one, and she responded that they both were recently renovated. This was absolutely nothing that I noticed anyways. Another thing, I know that this hotel gets A LOT of honeymoon couples and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great. I mean Maui has always been HUGE for Honeymoon couples, I know that. But if this Resort could put in any effort in showing appreciation, it would go a long way. They did nothing to let us know that they were glad we decided to spend our honeymoon staying in their hotel. I had to ask the receptionist if they did any kind of flower lei greeting when we arrived. She went into the backroom and came back and handed us two shell leis, which was pretty nice. When I went to the room I asked the express service line if they had any kind of special honeymoon stuff that they do, like champagne or rose pedals on the bed. Later that evening I was surprised with a nice bottle of Champagne, so I thought WOW how nice is that! I thought this bottle would be a great way to celebrate my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday, which was on Wednesday the 23rd. So I went and made dinner reservations at the hotel's Pacifica Restaurant for Wednesday at 6:30pm, just in time to eat dinner watching the sunset. Unfortunately though when I brought the bottle of champagne to the hotel restaurant I was told due to Maui liquor laws I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink it there, we had to drink it in our room. Now that is fine and all, I can be pretty understanding in regards to state liquor laws, but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered any kind of alternative to the situation. The manager simply gave us a no, and the restaurant had to take it back to our room for us, we couldn't even take it with us. They then proceeded to show us their wine list and since we cant drink our honeymoon champagne for dinner, we can now instead buy some drinks! The waiter was very nice, but we decided to go to Cane & Taro which is next door in Whaler's Village, where we had a great dinner! Last, The $25 charge they make you pay is a complete rip-off. Now I know most hotels are using this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort charge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd these days, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a complete racket and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised some hotels haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t removed it yet as a courtesy. Among the things you are given for this charge are two small bottles of water per day and 1 photo session with a 4x6 image (more up sell opportunities for them to make more money) and I got to say for $25 a night the photographic company that takes the photos should call you to schedule an appointment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hi, my name is __________ we noticed that you recently checked in today and would like to know if you would like to schedule an appointment today for your photo session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When we did go to make an appointment we were told they didnt have any openings until the following week! In closing, the pool was beautiful, and the staff was extremely nice, but this Starwood property needs some major updating! The nickel and diming of guests needs to stop somewhere. Instead of having multiple concierge associates, re-assign some of them to a specific task like following up with guests that are staying there for a special event! This is Maui, not some downtown slum! Show up the other resorts Westin! I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been pretty critical, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pointing this stuff out so that they can learn and improve! Guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who are traveling to Maui have a lot of options to choose from, and Westin is on prime real estate on Kaanapali beach! If they completely gut and renovate the property, it will be unbelievable! Until then I cant recommend this property to anyone, and will be sending people to the Hyatt, Marriott, or Four Seasons in Wailea.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel Stay Ever\u201d", "Author": "sunshineseeker717", "ReviewID": "UR68733595", "Content": "The Westin Maui was probably one of the best hotel stays I've ever experienced.

Beyond that, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of this as a Westin. Our 1st room was in the Ocean Tower\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis is the oldest section of the hotel, although we heard that some of the mountain view rooms had been renovated. Our ocean view room had awful lighting, dilapidated furniture, worn carpet, black stains in the grout, and no closets. The layout was very poor with too much furniture crammed in, which is probably why most people say the rooms are too small. Some reviewers have noted that the rooms are dirty, but it seems more like years of crud built up in various places that housekeeping just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remove. One thing we noticed was sprinkler heads, of all things. One was completely rusted out and the other was so caked with dust & dirt that it was barely recognizable. Would they have worked in a fire? Maybe, but their condition shows a total lack of regard for guests. On day 2 we went to the front desk and started describing the issues with our room. Before we got halfway through the list, the clerk was already moving us to a room in the Beach Tower. This room was MUCH better, although the couch looked like something they had found on the side of the road. It was filthy. We were warned there might be noise from Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village, but this was not a problem. The staff was pleasant, even though they were usually overwhelmed. Day after day there was a line at the front desk and the phone rang off the hook as 1 or 2 clerks worked diligently. Meanwhile, 6 or 7 concierges (a.k.a. timeshare salespeople) stood around chatting together. Either hire more desk staff or train those concierges to help out. There is no SPG member check-in. Bottom line is that this place needs a major overhaul. Maybe the Beach Tower can do with just a sprucing up\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnew carpet & tile, fresh paint, furniture replacement, etc. The Ocean Tower needs to be gutted and modernized.

As an SPG Gold member, I was able to redeem some points for this hotel. The pools and lobby area are beautiful. The rooms are decent. There is a little fridge which is helpful. We went to Safeway and Walmart to save on snacks and drinks. We were put on the 2nd floor facing the parking lot so it was pretty noisy in the morning. I've stayed at Starwood hotels all over the world and this was the most crowded resort by far. As mentioned by other reviews, there are lots and lots of kids running around. On our first day, it was so crowded that we couldn't get a chair at the pool. It was around 11am. The trip did get better and the surrounding area is nice and you could walk to a lot of places like Whalers Village. If you decide to go to Maui I would recommend checking out Front st. This area is a 6-8 minute drive from the hotel and has cool shops and restaurants that are right on the beach. We ate at Kimo's and Lahaina Fish Co. If you make reservations, you will most likely get a table with a great ocean view. We watched the sunset from Lahaina Fish Co. and the view was PHENOMENAL. The food and prices at Kimo's and Lahaina FIsh Co. are decent. Also on Front St. was Ululani's Hawaiian Shave Ice. This was the best shaved ice we had in Maui. You could tell they take great pride and care into making each shaved ice creation. Do not get a shaved ice at the snack bar at the Westin, it immediately turned into a solid piece of ice and was difficult to eat. So in conclusion, the Westin Maui would be more appropriate for families or for people looking for an active vacation (snorkeling, surfing, etc.). This is a decent hotel but for the points and prices I've seen, I don't think it's a great value. From a Starwood points perspective, I think the Le Meridien Cancun or Westin Cancun gives you a better value. If you were looking for a more romantic or relaxing place, don't go here.

It definitely was not too small for the two of us.

We got up to our room (939) and were beyond thrilled to see a spotless and upgraded room. The room overlooked the pool and ocean. Magnificent grounds and rooms. I wouldn't say the rooms were small. I would describe them as Cozy. At about 7 am i would step out on the balcony and see people starting to reserve their chairs for the day. Even though there were reserved chairs we never had a hard time finding lounge chairs. The ones that seemed to go the fastest were the ones under the Tiki Umbrellas. The pool was always clean and the water was perfect. The one thing that I was alittle dissappointed with was that the \"Family\" pool is meant for people who are there with children, and the \"Adult\" pools is meant for people there with no children. I noticed alot of people who were there without children overtook the family pool. I am pretty sure that if I took my 5 year old to the adults only pool I would have been asked to leave. One day after coming back from a sunrise tour I was ready for a realxing massage. I called the spa to ask if I could get an appointment that day. I was pleasantly surprised they asked if I could come down in an hour. YES YES and YES I said. the locker room was fantastic and I could have stayed in there all day. But as I walked into the waiting area I thought I stepped onto a movie set. All the chairs are facing what seemed like a glass wall overlooking the ocean. AWESOME place to kick back and have some Mommytime. I had the BEST massage from Paris and the most Amazing facial from Maria. I hope when I make it to Maui again they both will still be there. I walked out feeling like a million bucks. MAHALO to the whole spa staff !! If you are searching for a place to stay in Maui. Look no further ! Westin is a fabulous place to stay for your Hawaii getaway. Not only is it gorgeous, but it is close to everything. Stay at the Westin you will not be disappointed !

We stayed at the Westin on May 8 to 11, 2010. We are a young couple in our late 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and fell in love with this hotel! We arrived at the Westin around 2 pm and were able to check into our room early. We booked an ocean view room and were assigned to the 11th floor in the Beach Tower. Upon arrival, the Westin gives each of their guests a shell lei which I thought was a nice touch. (None of the other hotels we stayed at while in Hawaii gave out any type of lei.) The view from out room was absolutely perfect. Some on Trip Advisor have complained about the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small rooms, but we have nothing to complain about. Yes, the rooms are a little smaller than a typical hotel room, but we felt like we still had plenty of room. The beds at the Westin are very comfortable, and we always got a very good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep while we were there! The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grounds are immaculate and quite beautiful. There are waterfalls everywhere in and around their five pools. The pools are large and only about 2 or 3 people were in each one at any given time. One of the pools has a water slide. The Westin has a lagoon with several flamingos and two swans. They also have parrots and a cockatiel. We stayed at Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas a few years ago and the Westin reminded me of a small slice of Atlantis. The Westin is in a perfect location on Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach and only a short walk to the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village. There are several restaurants around the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village and there is also some nice shops there. The Westin is also about a five minute walk along Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach to Black Rock. My husband and I loved Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. In fact, it is one of our favorite beaches in all of Hawaii! There were always plenty of chairs by the pool, but the hotel does not offer free chairs for the beach like our hotel on Kauai did. Also, we never felt like the beach, pools, or hotel was overrun with kids as some have said. We only saw about 3 kids the whole time we were there. This may have been due to the fact that we were there in May and school was not out yet. The only complaint we have about the hotel is the size of the parking spaces. Although there were always plenty of parking spaces to choose from for self-parking, the spaces were super small. My husband usually had to back the car out for me so I could get inside and I am a small person! One time, someone parked too close to my husband, and they only way he could get into the car to drive it was from the passenger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side! If I remember correctly, the self parking at the hotel was free but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you are paying for it in the $25 per night \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they charge!

If Ocean view is important to you, call ahead or make sure that your room is an ocean view room. The hotel itself is nice appointed and decorated in an asian style. The koi pond and waterfall that greet you in the lobby are very nice and soothing. The pool area is impressive and very kid friendly. I have a 10 year old and we just turned him loose on the pool. No need for kids club. If you do not have kids, beeline for the adult pool. The biggest stress of the day was getting chairs by the pool. It is first come first serve, so you need to be down there before 6:00 AM if you want anything. You can also reserve chairs on the beach or beach cabanas for a fee but you need to call at least one day in advance to guarantee. Pleanty of charter companies for activities (sailing, snorkeling, scuba, whale watch, etc.) I recommend walking down to the Sheraton and snorkling black rock. Very friendly waters and cool fish. If you can get breakfast included in your rate, that is the way to go. The buffet is $28 ($15 for kids), really good, but can blow your budget up. The poolside restaurant is good as well. Was not impressed with the bar. Specialty drinks were not good. There is an attempt to get you to see the timeshare property, but they asked me once and then left me alone. We also did the Luau and were disappointed. It was basically an average dinner with a show. Seating is first come first serve. Being in a chronically late family, we sat in the back.

We absolutely love this hotel for many reasons, friendly staff, spacious rooms, sparkling pools and a soft sandy beach. We've been staying at the Westin Maui for the past 4 years, always during the Feb/Mar timeframe. It's the perfect break from the Chicago winters. A great vacation starts with a great room with a great view. The hotel has a range of rooms: mountain view, ocean view, deluxe ocean view and premium deluxe ocean view. We've stayed in all of them over the years, but have found the premium deluxe ocean views rooms are the best value. Believe me, paying the incremental cost to get the premium deluxe room is well worth it. The room is larger with a couch, larger lanai with beautiful views of the pool and beach. The Westin offered a great promotion, pay for 2 nights, get one free, including daily breakfast buffet. Take advantage of this offer (if available). The morning breakfast buffet exceeds expectations, it includes all of the standard breakfast greats, plus a made to order omlette station. It's a great way to start the day. We alternated our days between the adult pool and the beach cabana. Definitely rent the beach cabana for a day ($55), but make a reservation the day before because they are in demand. The cabana attendant brings you waters throughout the day and freshcut pinnapple for a light snack. The cabanas are much quieter than the pool, steps from the ocean and perfect location to watch the whales in the distance. On the days we spent at the pool, we took advantage of the \"drink of the day\", always something tasty and refreshing, especially the mai tai! For those who like to hit the gym on vacation, the Westin offers a plenty, lots of machines and free weights. It's next to the Spa, overlooking the pool. I always have a deal with my girlfriend, when I go play golf, she gets to go to the spa. She always love the treatments. For golfers, the Kaanapali course behind the hotel is perfect, you could walk to the clubhouse or the valet guys will drive you over. Ask about the 2 and 4 round specials. In the evening, you cannot beat sitting out on the lanai, watching the sunset, and enjoying a cocktail. The Westin is close to Lahaina (5 mins) with lots of great restaurant options, Lahaina Grill, I/O, Pacifico, and Mala, all offering fantastic seafood dishes. Talk to the Westin conceirge to book the reservations. On our day of departure, the Westin helped us maximize our final day of pool time by accomdating us with a late checkout and access to a courtesy guest room to freshen up before the long overnight flight.

I'm tagging along (AKA \"mooching\") with my husband at his company's annual corporate recognition event! Thank God I'm in Maui... I'll start with location. The resort's location in Ka'anapali is what resulted in a one-star reduction. It isn't the Westin's specific location...it's Ka'anapali in general. If you don't mind eating mediocre food three times a day and seeing nothing of the native culture, you can add the star back on. In order to have a plethora of 5-star experiences - in both food and activities - you have to drive a lot, pretty much a minimum of 20 minutes one way. Our room...well, well, well. This is where corporate shines. My husband arrived a few days before me...and prepared me. I knew it was going to be great when this normally sedate man called me and told me to prepare myself for the room...he was actually kind of embarrassed. When we're footing the bill, we stay in glorified closets. On the corporate dole, our \"room\" was the size of a small apartment and over looked both the pool and the ocean. We had four balconies. The bath \"room\" was just that...a room (about the size of my bedroom at home). We also had a living room, office area, dining room, bedroom, and guest bath (that never saw a tush). The decor was...mmmm, corporate (completely lacking in personality), but I am surely not complaining. The pool...we hid in the adult pool section, away from the squealing kids sliding down (and up) the water slides. If our kids had been with us, I have no doubt that they would have never left the kids' pool. In the adult sanctuary, you will find two quiet pools with lots of lounge chairs (never had to look farther than a few feet for an empty one), a small jacuzzi, and an adult bar with roving server (ahhhh...perfect for those poolside lava flows). Service...mostly impeccable, starting with the porters at the front door and ending with the room service ladies. (If you don't want a.m. and afternoon nap wake-up service, you need to make good use of the \"Do Not Disturb\" placard.) The exception was the restaurant staff...plan on repeating yourself a lot, waiting patiently for things to arrive (i.e., menus, food, checks, etc.), and - if you're lucky - you might get to see the hostess sleep standing up. Tips...the poolside restaurant is not too overpriced and serves a decent lunch. You'll go broke if you eat there for breakfast (or at the walk-up snack stand where I paid $17 for a bagel, tea and pineapple). The porter who brought me up to my room gave me a great tip cementing my philosophy that you never miss an opportunity to ask a local for advice. (I brought him a cream puff from the island's best local bakery later in repayment...he then called me \"Cream Puff\". This is what life is all about.) Talk to Bob, the local macaw...Bob is funny.

We went on our honeymoon and had the vacation of our dreams! We arrived at the hotel at about 7:30 in the evening and the check-in was quick and efficient. When we went up to our room, champagne was waiting for us with a card congratulating us on our marriage. After unpacking we walked around the resort grounds for a while, taking in the gorgeous open-air lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c flamingoes, ducks and parrots that call the resort ponds and trees their home. Our 9th floor premium deluxe oceanview room was the perfect size for the two of us, it included a king bed (which really is heavenly!), a sofa, a dresser, a refrigerator stocked with 2 bottles of water (which was re-stocked every day), a coffeemaker and a desk. The room was very quiet, we never heard our neighbors. The lanai was furnished with two chairs and a table and was also the perfect size for the two of us to relax with books or watch the sunset. Our last night in Maui, we ordered room service (which was very reasonably priced!) and wheeled the cart onto the lanai and had a beautiful dinner under the stars overlooking the resort and ocean with the sound of waves crashing in the distance, it was fabulous! Our vacation package included breakfast for two every morning, so each morning we enjoyed the breakfast buffet (a huge selection of food, absolutely DELICIOUS, especially the omelets and smoothies) overlooking Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach and the ocean. We spent quite a few days lounging around the adult pool, a very quiet and spacious pool that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elevated from the others (so you can relax easier without kids running around you) with lava flows and a private bar. The pool was surrounded on all sides with lounge chairs, and as others have said there were lots of lounge chairs that were being reserved with towels, however we could usually find two lounge chairs side by side. We also took advantage of renting covered beach lounge chairs through the resort which was fantastic! The beach right outside the resort is also great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c incredibly soft sand, gently waves, and plenty of room to lay out a towel. We loved that the Westin was so close to the shopping center next door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a great place to grab some ice cream or purchase some Maui souvenirs for your family back home. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a food court with a McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for a cheap meal if you would prefer. There are a few restaurants located on the boardwalk. None of them are as good as the restaurants in downtown Lahaina though (in my opinion), so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a good place to eat or great night life then definitely head out to downtown Lahaina for the evening. Lahaina has local restaurants along with chain restaurants (such as Bubba Gumps and Red Lobster) and they range from cheap to expensive and everything in between, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for everyone. Just a side note \u00e2\u20ac\u201c best burgers we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had was at Cool Cat Caf\u00c3\u00a9 in downtown Lahaina! There is a $25 resort fee charge per day which includes use of the gym, parking lot, wireless internet, bottles of water and other little things like pool towels. We knew about it before we got there so we were expecting it and it seemed reasonable. Especially since we used the internet so much while we were there. Other than the beautiful grounds, delicious breakfasts, spacious rooms (with truly heavenly beds), some other pluses: we could always find parking even in the evening with the exception of once when we had to valet because the lot was full, the location is perfect, and the resort is large enough that even if all the rooms were filled it still wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel crowded, and the snorkeling available at Black Rock is a huge plus. There are tons of activities that the resort offers (snorkeling, surf lessons, para-sailing, scuba lessons, crafts, and many more) all with an extra cost, but fun stuff for all ages.

Slept with the lights on every night and kept my suitcases zipped for fear of what crawled around. The staff will only recommend trips/tours if they do business with the company. I suggest researching things to do before arriving in Maui. The hotel is dirty but I do have to say the staff is friendly. If you go here - you are stuck until your plane leaves.

Upon arrival at the airport we realised that a taxi would cost us $100 whilst a shuttle (which according to the hotel we should have pre-booked) would have cost us $60; therefore we picked up a car from Avis for $153. The hotel staff were very nice and our room was ready upon our arrival at 2pm. We had a view of the ocean and the balcony was perfect for sipping champagne while watching sunset. The room which contained two double beds was somewhat small although we appreciated the fridge. Two things - make sure you ask for the ocean tower and I'd ask for a floor in the upper level so you can see the beach as well; it was a little limited from the 4th floor! The gym and 5 pools were great; particularly the adult pool. The food was fabulous as well. We chilled out and read books by the pool and then snorkeled at Black Rock at the Sheraton. Our only criticism is we found the food to be very expensive; not so much the poolside food but rather breakfast options and dinner. If you are looking for sushi - try Genki Sushi at the shopping center next to Lehaina Farms (the Westin shuttle drops off and picks up passengers which will also allow you to buy water, soft drinks etc for your room).

We are the \"picky\" type couple, and we scrutinize easily, especially when it comes to services, hotels, etc. Let me just say that we were very pleased, and some with this resort. First off when you arrive you walk in and its like a rain forest, opens to big trees with a surrounding pool filled with big koi fish, pink flamingos and native birds. The decor is asian themed, which is pretty cool. samurais and chinese artwork and sculptures. This was nice instead of the cheesy touristy hawaaian print everywhere. We got an \"ocean view\" room. We were on the 3rd floor facing whalers village, our view was amazing. it was not ocean FRONT, but ocean view, meaning a view of the ocean. since we were near the front we had an awesome view of kaanapali beach and up to black rock. there was a parking lot below us and at times in the early morning you can hear the beer trucks and delivery trucks backing up, unloading, etc. but once the morning rush is over, who cares, the view of the ocean and the sunsets is 100 times better. We were perfectly located centrally. being directly next to whalers village was a HUGE plus because there are cheaper restraunts at the food court, AND an ABC store, which basically has every and anything you need. The staff are very professional and good at what they do. always smiling, always willing to help. the host for breakfast even remembered our names, which was impressive given all the people they see on a daily basis. the room was very spacious, large king bed, huge dresser. big desk and workspace, a couch, and huge bathroom. AND the shower, wow, best ever. the water pressure was very very powerful, felt so good after a day on the beach and the pool. we got massages in the morning, but was a little overpriced at 145 bucks for 50 minutes, for 2 thats 300 dollars, which looking back would be better spent on shopping or nice dinners and drinks. DRINKS at the hotel are expensive. 11 dollars for mai tais and daquiris, so prepare. ALSO, take the 25 bus to lahaina mall and go food shopping and get drinks, sodas, snacks, meats and cheeses. It is VERY expensive to eat in Maui, VERY. TIP: if available purchase the program that offers free breakfast buffett. it was WELL worth it considering eggs and bacon is 18 dollars per person, not including beverages. we ate breakfast at the hotel every morning, check wtih your booking agent about upgrading to a room offering free breakfast. snorkeling out front is amazing, directly out front of hotel. black rock was cool just to say you snorkeled there and take some pics, but its crowded and visibility is bad due to all the people and kids kicking up sand and debris. housekeeping was of course very professional and courteous as expected. we thought the sheets were a little weird on the bed, took a few nights to get used to them, you will see what I mean. we loved sitting on our balcony at night just watching the waves roll in and the activity along the ocean front. beautful mountain views to the right ocean to the left and front. cant beat it. THE POOL by faaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrr the best pool on kaanapali beach. we walked to all the other resort/hotels on the strip there and nothing even came close to the westin pool. this pool area is huuuuge, like a freakin small waterpark, slides for the kids, and a pool just for adults up top. sitting at the pool and in all the waterfalls you look out to the most amazing view in maui, the view of lanai and mollakai. doesnt get better. There is a 25 dollar per day room charge. which sounds like a lot, but it covers parking if you have a car, unlimited wifi in your room for internet, AND you also get a free photo from a photographer on staff. should you have any more questions about your upcoming trip to Maui, please feel free to email me, ill answer questions and give insight. i know how much I appreciated all the tips from others prior to our departure, i want to do the same for you.

The purpose of our trip was to celebrate his birthday. We are in our late 20's early 30's. We don't take many vacations so when we do we like to splurge. This hotel is definitely the right place for that. We booked our room (and flight and car) through Costco travel. They were fantastic and I have no complaints. We checked in around 3 o'clock and it was very quick. They gave us shell lei's (flowers cost extra :( ) and also sent a yummy cake up to the room for bf's birthday) We were given a partial-ocean view room on the 5th floor of the beach tower (room 521). It was great, even though directly across from the elevator I never heard it once. The view was a combination of the waterfall and ponds in the hotel lobby, pool area, beach and ocean. We both enjoyed leaving the glass door open at night and falling asleep to the sound of the waterfall. The room was clean, and adequate. The bed was very comfortable. It's true, room service did come a bit late but we were barely in the room anyway so it wasn't a hassle. The part of the service that truly impressed me the most (and this is partially Hawaiian airlines doing as well) was due to a late flight off the mainland one of our bags was lost. We filled out the necessary paperwork and were on our way. Once we got to the hotel we let the bellman know and then headed out to check out the northern end of Ka'anapali beach. By the time we got back to our room (no more than 2 1/2 hours) our bag was waiting for us in our room! I was amazed; their attentiveness saved me loads of stress. I had called a month ahead of time to reserve a cabana for the day after my bf's birthday. When I called the towel desk had only been open for an hour and someone had already booked the cabana I wanted! So if you want to do this you need to call ASAP. We rented the cabana near the adult pool, between bar and the ocean; it had very cozy lounge chairs and had the most amazing view of the ocean. The cabana boy regularly brought us ice water and pineapple and our waitress Keisha brought us everything else. It was such a relief to have this area to ourselves and not have to worry about walking away and losing our spots or having to carry all our stuff around if we wanted to take a dip in the ocean. We invited some people we met the day before to join us, otherwise it would have been way too big for just two people. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll post pictures so you can see. We also rented a small two person cabana the next day because I was sunburn and wanted to stay out of the sun. It also had great service but the view wasn't as good. I was able to use the gym and the spa during our stay. The elliptical on the far left was a bit jarring, so I moved to the far right and it was much better. All the machines have large TV's mounted at eye-level. This is great if you want to watch TV, however I would have preferred to look at the view behind the TV, besides I brought my iPod and like listening to my music while working out. It would have been nice if you had the option of lowering the TV so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not forced to stare at the blank screen. The spa was beautiful, and my lomi lomi massage was very relaxing. Part of our package was the free breakfast buffet. Neither my bf nor I are really breakfast people but we tried it a few times. The food was always decent, and displayed nicely. My only complaint might be the birds. I understand that we're eating outside and it comes with the territory but some of the birds were actually sitting in the vase that the serving utensils were put in (in front of the chafing dish), that was a little too close for comfort. We also were given a free portrait sitting, you basically walk around the lobby with their professional photographer and he takes a bunch of pictures. Then you go back to his desk and pick your favorite picture and he prints it out for free. You can buy a disc with all the shots for $100!? That was my biggest shocker of the trip. It only took him 5 minutes to take the photos and it costs next to nothing to transfer them to a disc, I just cannot justify where the cost of $100 comes from.

Left with mixed review\u201d", "Author": "Sar31", "ReviewID": "UR62797492", "Content": "(FYI: We stayed on the 11th floor of the ocean tower) After spending WEEKS before our trip reading reviews... I was slightly worried about this place being, well, dated and dirty. To be honest, we must have had a great maid (Roxalinda) because we didn't have that problem. We had a late check in due to a late flight and weren't greeted with a lei.. which bummed me out-but I got over it. I'm an adult! But check in was smooth--could have been because we arrived at 5pm. Arrived to the room and were happy with the quality. I will say that it is a small room... but being that my boyfriend and I are average sized and traveled without children, it was perfect for us. Bathroom was separate from vanity, which some people may hate, but I'm adjust easily. Here's my biggest complaint of all.... THE VIEW. We paid in advance for an upgrade to a \"partial ocean view\" and feel we got screwed. I've traveled all though out the world, in all types of hotels, motels, ocean views and partials... and this was BY FAR the worst \"partial\" ocean view I've ever stayed at. I'd rename it to the Mountain and Golf course/parking lot view... because that's what it was. ((I bet the regular view was probably on the 5-6th floor, and partial ocean was up on the 10th and 11th of the ocean tower.)) I guess its because the building was on an angle, but either way, I was not happy waking up to car alarms on a regular basis. Next to that, we were the lucky couple that got placed right next to the elevator. We stayed, and I didn't complain to the front desk only because we weren't in the room too much. But after 3 nights of being woken up by it, it got frustrating. So word to the wise, if you get placed there... ask to relocate immediately. Now I have to note about the pool--since I'm sure you all want to know.. It's an awesome pool and you can ask for as many towels as you'd like. There adult pool is a great quiet kid-free zone for those that aren't looking for loud pool recreation. For those of you that have young kids, it does not have a lot of places that are shallow enough for kids exploring the water, but the perk is that they let you have water toys/rafts in the pool... so maybe you could bring. those for your child. My only complaint about the pool is that people would go down to the pool and reserve the good spots under umbrellas at 7am, then leave for breakfast. So people like me that looked for a spot at 8-9am, went looking for a spot amongst a sea of towels... that's not right. We were shocked too that they closed down a majority of the pool for some private event ALL DAY Sunday. That's not fair to regular guests of the hotel. Listen, its clear to anyone traveling to Maui that its expensive and you can't avoid resort fees. Once you get over that-its easy to have a good time. Save some money by grabbing some snacks/booze from the ABC store, hit up happy hour and eat at the food court in Whalers Village if you want to save money, but most of all, rent a car and travel around Maui--- its worth it because its beautiful! Good: Location, staff was friendly, shops on site, beach, pool, lava flow drinks!, the spa, Internet was fine for me on my iphone, happy hour specials, if parking is unavailable the valet will park for you free, Bad: the view, Tropica restaurant, old chairs for beach, late check out = $50, people saving chairs at pool, Tia Juanas restaurant down the block, things shut down after 10:30pm", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great views but rooms lacked......\u201d", "Author": "TravelMom20102010", "ReviewID": "UR62610308", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin for 4 nights during mid April 2010. We are a family of 4 and enjoyed the Westin and our experience- here are a list of the good and the bad- The good- * Location is great- right on the beach, next to the Whaler's village for shopping and restaurants- the boardwalk in front of the hotel was a great place to walk/run in the morning. * We were in an ocean front room-the view was awesome and amazing. We saw whales daily playing right in front of the hotel and it was great to leave the screen door open each night and fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean. * The pools were great for our kids and they loved the water slides as well as the different activities in and around the pool each day. There seemed to be plenty of chairs around the pool and we had no trouble finding a spot. We went and did activities during the morning in would wind up at the pool early afternoon and never had trouble getting chairs. We were not there during a major holiday or spring break. * The lobby is very pretty- little walk ways to go through and birds throughout the lobby made the kids happy to explore. * The staff was friendly and we never had a bad experience with anyone working in the hotel. * They offer fun activites for the kids daily- most are free, our kids loved feeding the birds in the morning- but the best activity was the star gazing with Becky- she was great and showed our family all the different plants/stars. We were the only people at the star gazing on the night we went so we had a private lesson. We were not able to look through the telescope due to the mist but even without the telescope we learned and saw many new things. Now the Bad- * The rooms are small- which is no big deal since you don't really spend too much time in the room to begin with- However- our room was not very clean when we checked in. I thankfully had wipes in my bag so I was able to wipe down surfaces. The bathroom looked like no one had wet mopped the floor in months-hair, sticky, a make up spot on the tile etc... The dressers and vanities were not clean, cup stains, finger prints and just plain dirty and there was a splattered on the wall above the coffee maker that looked like it had been there for months- The switch plates were flithy and the temperture gages on the thermostat were almost black with finger prints. It was pretty bad! Since we loved the view from the room we did not ask to change rooms, I just spent some time wiping things down and removing stains. But it does make you wonder how clean the room is between vistors- this is pretty basic stuff- I am not asking for 2x daily cleanings etc.. just some basic wiping down of floors and vanities. Bring your wipes and plan on doing some cleaning if this stuff bothers you- I'm not a Kate Gosselin who freaks out about cleaning etc...- it was just basically dirty! * The rooms need to be updated- they have a very 80's-ish feel and could stand some updating. * If you are staying there for any length of time and like your room serviced before 3:30-4:00 you need to call housekeeping and ask to have it done early- they seem to be a little under staffed and there were days when we came back to the room at 4:00 and they still hadn't gotten to our room yet. * We had the breakfast buffet a few days and asked at one point to have a to-go container to take back bagels that the kids had not eaten etc.... and we were told that you are not allowed to use to go containers at the buffet. While I understand this theory, and they are trying to prevent people from scamming the buffet and paying for 1 person to have breakfast then stock piling food for other people who did not pay, it seems a bit ridiculous when all 4 us had paid for the buffet and we were just trying to take bagels that were already on the kids plates out of the restaurant. We wound up carrying them with the cream cheese and all out of the restaurant in our hands. Give me a break! We have been to many hotel buffets all over the country and this has never been an issue- if you paid for the buffet you should be able to take things with you to some degree!! * I was also told, very politely, that you are not allowed to have coolers at the pool- again I understand this rule in theory-preventing people from bringing large amounts of alchol to the pool to consume etc.... however my cooler was filled with water and juice boxes for my kids. When I told/showed the staff member what was in my cooler to prove that I was just a Mom providing drinks to her kids, he told me that I had to hide the cooler in my bag and not bring it out if I wanted to keep it at the pool. I think the hotel needs to be a little more flexible on some of the rules that they enforce, especially for families traveling with small kids. If I was guzzling beers from my cooler all day then I think I should be spoken to but when the cooler is filled with water and jouce boxes I think the staff might what to pick their battles. I would come back to this hotel if I could stay in the an ocean front room again. The good out weighs the bad in my eyes and would recommend this hotel to a friends- I am just planning on having some cleaning products on hand to take care of the things that housekeeping missed, some plastic bags to carry my left overs in from the buffet and a larger beach bag to hide my juice box cooler in on my next visit!", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "plum0411", "Title": "\u201cNice and expected\u201d", "Author": "plum0411", "ReviewID": "UR61861625", "Content": "Writing this review while staying here right now (got here yesterday, leaving in 5 days).

Liked the bed because it was super-soft (if you like soft) . I'm five months pregnant & hungry at odd hours, so i was happy to see a small fridge which can actually hold more than a pint of milk (the in-fridge freezer can hold only the size of an ice tray unfortunately). I actually managed to fit in milk, apple juice, three bottles of water, three apples and two mangos, so i was happy. Beach is a step away, i don't know why people complain about the towels and how, if lost, we owe them $25. Just don't lose the towels, how hard is that? no big deal i think. Service is average, nothing special.It's not like they remember my name or anything (walked up to the same front-desk person and she didn't recall me at all i think), considering i checked in yesterday, but then again this is a BIG hotel, so understandable. Our room view kinda blows (we're on the third floor overlooking the parking lot (called \"Mountain view\" i think) but at least it's away from the elevator. we were given the option to \"upgrade\" to pretty much the same view, except higher up, but we declined becuase it would have been two double beds instead of king bed (i need all the room i can get with my expanding belly!). It's interesting how they spin it as an upgrade since it's still a view of the parking lot! Tried to see if any rooms were available today for a \"complimentary upgrade\" with a king bed a day later, but no go, seems like the offer is only for when you get there first.

Its a typical hotel room with two beds and a bathroom. The room was very small compared to most hotels, two people could not pass each other without one having to step behind a bed.. The beds were doubles, not queens, so it was not very spacious sleeping arrangements. You could tell this was an older hotel. Our cost was$325 per night with tax.

On my last day, I signed up for paddle-boarding and received an amazing lesson from the friendly staff at the recreation booth. It was an experience of a lifetime! and I recommend it to everyone.

I was especially torn between the Sheraton down the beach and the Westin Maui. As a Starwoods Gold member staying on cash & points, everything I read online told me the chance for an upgrade was better at the Sheraton. But with young kids, I opted for the better pool figuring that we would spend little time in whatever room we received anyway. Surprisingly, we ended up being upgraded - twice. From the mountain side of the Ocean Tower to the oceanview side and then again to the Beach Tower facing north towards the Sheraton and Black Rock (overlooking Whalers Village). Obviously, not everyone can be upgraded but if you are given the option of either the Beach Tower or the Ocean Tower, go for the Beach Tower, which has newer and larger rooms. It also has lighter and brighter halls and public areas. Each floor is designated a \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" floor, I guess owing to the new-ness of the building itself. Only the top few floors in the Ocean Tower are given that designation. Because the rooms are larger, our standard room also had a twin-sized overstuffed chair with pull-out bed which gave our family of four some extra sleeping space. We also had a bathroom with dual sinks, a refrigerator, safe, etc. The only problem with the room was we had smokers next door out on the lanai. When I called the front desk to see about moving to another room (maybe another upgrade?), I was informed that smoking wasn't allowed in the rooms or on the lanais and only in designated areas on the property. The front desk manager told me security would be dispatched to the offending party's room immediately. Yikes! Not only was security there within minutes (I heard them knock), the couple next door checked out the next day. The $25 resort fee does seem a little exhorbinant at first but when I thought about it, it really wasn't that bad. In the age of hotels and air carriers nickel and diming for everything, paying $25 each day for parking, internet access, gym access and two bottles of water daily seemed like a good deal. On a recent trip to San Francisco, I paid $35 per day to park my car, $12.95 for daily internet access, $10 per day for the gym but opted to bring my own water. If you don't plan on using these amenities then yes, it's kind of ridiculous but you can always try to take it up with management. The parking is close by and secure, the internet access realtively fast, the gym very well equipped, and the water welcome. Plus you get the free shuttles to the other Starwood properties and to Lahaina. The grounds and pools were all lovely. We never had trouble finding two lounge chairs together among the several pool decks. The kids loved the water slide and the activties including the lei making, henna tattoos, and ukulele lessons. They didn't visit the Kids Club but it looked like it had several great programs. One night, the hotel staff set up a large movie screen on the pool deck and we watched \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\" Since it started at dinner time, I ran next door to the food court at Whaler's Village and brought back dinner to eat on the lounge chairs as the kids watched the movie. Another night, the staff brought in an amateur astronomer and telescope and we did a little stargazing. We rented a beach umbrella and chairs for a full day for $25 and it was well worth having a reserved spot under cover although there is plenty of room on the beach. The items are yours for the entire day and we didn't have any problem leaving for lunch and returning later. Other resorts down the beach that we visited (Hyatt & Marriott) don't allow these items on their short beaches, only on the grass lawns above them. I have to admit that we didn't have any meals on property during our four nights. As many reviewers have suggested the food was quite expensive. We chose to eat next door at Whaler's Village for almost every meal when we weren't visiting Lahaina. The restaurants are diverse and the food court offers several options including a McDonald's. All in all, it was a great experience, helped along by the upgrade, but since we spent very little time in the room anyway, I think I would have rated the hotel high anyway.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort - Will Stay again\u201d", "Author": "GlobalTravelGuy", "ReviewID": "UR56614468", "Content": "My wife and I, along with your two girls (4 and 5), stayed at the Westin Maui last week and had a fantastic time.

The hotel's location is fantastic - short walk (2 min) to Whaler's village is fantastic where there are a variety of restaurants, fast food type places and an ABC store.

As for luau, we didn't go but we did watch the fire dance from the sidewalk that runs right in front.

The gym was lacking in enough equipment even for me, and the stationary bicycle shook like it was about to fall apart. I often stay at a Westin in Cincinnati for work, and i was disappointed to find our room here was no nicer than that one (at $80/night!).

However, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised after we arrived. True, the rooms are small and this did color our view of this property. The small size was further complicated by the fact that they had placed a table and 2 chairs in front of a desk - which meant that the desk was unusable. The table and chairs made it somewhat difficult to move around. The prices are high but this seems to be the case in Hawaii. High prices for food and drink are not unique to this property. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. We did use the Concierge but be aware that another purpose of this desk is to get you to attend a time share presentation. Self parking was somewhat of an issue if you returned at night. The spaces are very small and not all drivers seem to be capable of parking straight, in between the lines, in these small spaces. As a result, many parking spaces were simply not usable. We used the American Express travel desk, located on-site, and the staff was very knowledgeable and very helpful. As other properties seem to do, this property charges a $25/day 'Resort Fee'. This fee gives you internet access and self-parking (plus a few other things). I am not a big fan of these 'fees'. We would return to this property in the future but we would also check out other properties in the area.

I complained to the front desk and they sent up an ionizer to clear the smell. They said it would be 3 hours to clear it, but my husband went to the room and they were removing the machine after only 1 hour. The smell was slightly better, but still stunk for the rest of our trip. We had been to this hotel 8 years before and remember the rooms being much nicer and cleaner. Definitely needs and overhaul. Friends of ours needed to be moved because they found cockroaches on their walls at night. The hotel was full, so they could not move us. Spent most of our time outside, so decided I would tolerate the smell. Other friends had a flood when their shower backed up smelly sewer water. The hotel didn't want to move them as they told them they were full. They threw a towel over the water, and after much complaining they managed to find my friends another room - hmmmm. Being right next door to Whaler's Village was a bonus, but as others have mentioned food prices and drinks at the hotel were expensive. $10 for a glass of wine, I bought a bottle of the same wine next door at ABC for $14. They do nickel and dime you for everything. You want a towel you need to get a wrist band and a big sign saying if you don't return your towels there is a $25 charge. To have a lounge chair on the beach is $5 each per day plus more for an umbrella. The first day there were absolutely no chairs around the pool to be had. I asked for one of the many beach loungers they had behind them to be brought to the beach and they said no they had rented out all the chairs they were renting for the day. So my first day was spent shopping at Whaler's because every time I checked around the pool all the chairs were occupied or has towels reserving them. You pay enough to stay at the hotel, there should be somewhere to sit and enjoy the pool or ocean. We had a great trip, despite the smell in the room and lack of space around the pool, and would probably stay close by there the next time, but would be tempted to check our their villas or The Sheraton.

It was so noisy that we kept the door to the balcony closed day and night and used airconditioning even though the temperatures were pleasant. Our room had with two \"full\" sized beds, and not queens which we are used to, so my husband and I slept in separate beds as each bed was too narrow for two people. The bedding resembled that of an Austrian ski resort instead of a tropical resort with heavy comforters and a down blanket between two sheets, so warm we had to take the covers off the beds in order to be able to sleep.

Incredible package value including rental car, room, \"resort fees\", breakfasts, 1 dinner, 2 bottles of water/day, self-parking, spa entries, $200 resort credit from travel agency. We read so-so reviews and didn't get our hopes up. We arrived Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving), and requested an upgrade to full Ocean View room - we got it ! (no additional cost) Very friendly service at front desk... plus they hand out little Leis (made of shells) to guests checking in - nice touch. Room was older, but pretty well updated - no problems. Bathroom was a little small, but worked great. Small refrig. and Coffee Maker in room (plus a safe, storage for food, etc). Beds were typ. Westin - heavenly (so, so comfy). View from room was jaw-dropping: approx. 160 degree view of lushly landscaped pool areas - then whitewater views of the deep blue Pacific Ocean. Ahhh, just need a glass of wine to complete the picture. Smallish lanai (patio area), but nice. Some people smoking on their lanais detracted from the pleasure. Suggest Snorkeling a few hundred yards north at \"Black Rock\" (in front of Sheraton hotel) - saw colorful fish, 2 Squid, and a large (3-4 foot diameter) Sea Turtle just cruising around near the shore. Wonderful. Snorkeling in front of Westin is OK (lots of \"Humu\" fish and other fish feeding in coral reefs a few feet offshore). Also great snorkeling at mile marker 14 about 7-8 miles South of the hotel. The afternoon was great for hanging out at the pool areas.... this was a very lush area with multiple pools (incl. \"Adults only pools\") and a decent waterslide for kids (and adults!). Uncrowded at this time of year (despite 83F temperatures - warm & sunny). Good drinks and sushi there also. Lots of waterfalls (all over the place) give a nice aura - and drown out most ambient noise. We ate breakfasts and 1 dinner at \"Ono Grill\" at Westin. Great outdoor seating, food was good (not great), prices were pretty high ($28 each for breakfast buffet), but ours was included with the travel package (whew). Ate a lot of pretty good food right at the hotel. Gym is very nice - 2nd floor overlooking the dining/pool areas. Concierges were very helpful to arrange stuff for us: (1) Parasailing... very fun, they launch you from the boat and let you out 600' or 1200' (depending on cost), and reel you in - you get a little wet... approx $100/person, I think. (2) Snorkel trip to Molikini on a Catamaran... too windy that day, and they docked very near the snorkel place we found near mile marker 19 south of Lahaina... I was prepared to be disappointed, but it was great ! \"Four Winds\" was the boat, I think... very friendly crew, OK breakfast (bagel & juice), good boat ride, great to just dive off the boat to snorkel, tons of colorful fish (and 1 smaller Sea Turtle) near the boat. GREAT BBQ lunch (burgers, chicken, beer, wine) About $100/person, but very enjoyable. We saw \"breach\" of 2 Humpback Whales in the channel. Cool. (3) Zip-lining... place near CJs deli nearby hotel, short drive up hills, strap on a harness, and zip down 8 cables (lengths of 300' to 1200') for about $160/person.... pretty exhilirating. One note: Self-Parking gets full at night (one night I snuck my rental car into the valet parking area). Westin is right next door to Whalers Village (outdoor mall) with shops and restaurants. Leilanis was OK (good Ono fish tacos). A small walk south to Hyatt Regency, we ate at Umalu restaurant on the beach - surprisingly great upscale pizza, burgers, salads - costly but good food quality. Recommend Roys Kahana Grill restaurant (7 miles North) - great service, FRESH fish, great ribs, and good Chocolate Souffle. Do not recommend \"I/O\" restaurant in Lahaina... highly rated in a travel book I had, but poor service and bland food and high prices made it a poor value (just my humble opinion). CJs deli (Kamaa street - above golf course) has great food for cheap (for Maui). Hotel has 2 internet terminals at coffee stand - no fee (nice feature). Also: no fee to check-in and print boarding passes in hotel lobby (near elevators) - another nice touch. We bought our own alcoholic beverages and snacks (plus souvenirs) at Costco and WalMart near the airport - to save money. We forgot we were stocking up on \"Black Friday\" (crowded)...oops. Negatives: I can't think of any (actually: we found the magnetic key cards get de-programmed every 2-3 days - a minor inconvenience). Westin performed very, very well !

For those traveling with family, note that this was the one hotel we could find that allowed us to book five into a room (me, wife, 15 year old and 12 year old twins). If you want to save $, the room had a king bed and pull out queen sofa. More than enough room for us. 4. Top beach - quite sand, fun waves, water is beautiful 5. Location - promenade provides easy walking access to whalers village next store and up through the Sheraton (lots of shopping and eating options within easy walking) Consider: 1. Free internet at the hotel coffee hut - available 24/7 (great diversion when awake at 2 am your first morning and every one else is still asleep) 2. Check out the stand next to the coffee hut - great value on postcard idea. Small wooden surf board that kids could decorate and write brief message. $10 with postage. A great keepsake (we send one to ourselves as well). Also send pinneapples home from hear. 3. Check out the ABC store in whalers village to stock up on supplies 4. Rent snorkel gear for the length of your stay at whalers village. We kept in the car and found a number of places to put in during our travels. Dont miss honolua bay in west maui. Went back a second day - great fish count, good visibility. Spent a lot on cruise to molokini but saw 100x the fish here. 5.

We waited for over an hour at hula grill, had lousy service and mediocre food. Do yourself a favor and stay onsite if you are only looking for casual dinner that can accommodate the kids. 7. Pizza at whalers village was tasty and a good value 8. Leave time on your trip to hana - at black sand beach before reaching hana, there are fresh water caves. The highlight for all three kids - leave yourself time earlier so you do not feel rushed here. A lot to see and do at this park. 9. If your daughter is looking for hula lessons (priority one for ours), there are free lessons on selected afternoons at whalers village. 10.

We booked it through the Hawaii Travel Bureau and saved lots of $$. They upgraded us for free to a full ocean view room with a king size bed. The lobby and grounds were spectacular as well as the service and amenities within the resort. The breakfast buffet was plentiful but costly at $28 USD per person (this was included in our room rate). But Whalers Village is only a few minutes away by foot and also has breakfast options including McDonalds. We had lunch at Ono's on the resort which also served healthy and tasty food (a sandwich lunch with salad will run you $18). But again Whalers Village and the ABC store is only a few minutes away where you can buy a sandwich for $5. We never had dinner on the resort as there are tonnes of dinner options in Lahaina to select from. There were adult as well as kid pools which gave us the option of having a quiet, relaxing day or a day filled with kids splashing and running around. There is also an activities desk right on the grounds to book outdoor activities or sunset dinner cruises and things like that. The beach in front of the hotel was clean and inviting. You can rent beach chairs for $5 each and umbrellas for $10 each. There is amazing snorkelling with green sea turtles at Black Rock at the Sheraton about a 10 minute walk away. There are tonnes of places to rent snorkel gear. At night the lobby was scented with aloe white tea incense which the hotel spa sells and it smelled amazing! There is free parking for cars but if the lot gets full then they valet park your car for free. There is a $25 per day resort fee which covers 2 free bottles of water per day, unlimited internet in your room and parking. There are also numerous concierge desks which help you plan excursions, dinners, tours etc. But be careful because they convinced us to attend a timeshare presentation and we wasted 2 hours doing it but they gave us $100 resort credit in return. I debated on booking this resort versus the Grand Wailea and the Marriott in Wailea but we took a drive down there and there was not much around.

We were supposed to receive a partial ocean view for ten nights and it was more like a full parking lot view in the back of the hotel. We felt that we were misled. We needed binoculars to view the ocean. We immediately switched rooms only to have the same problem.

The maids did not clean thoroughly and we would even tip them every so often. We have to say the Spa there was nice, although my massage with Zyla was disappointing as well.

I've read these reviews for quite some time in preparation for my recent trip to Maui. I honeymooned there three years ago and stayed at the Hyatt. We had a great time and really looked forward to going back. When we were pricing this recent trip, the Westin came in at over $1200 CHEAPER than the Hyatt. So we took a risk and stayed there, especially after reading some of the earlier reviews about cleanliness, service, etc. I was very pleased with the overall stay and would go back again, but dollar for dollar, the Hyatt is still our favorite. The Westin is definitely an older hotel that has been renovated but likely needs a few finishing touches. We stayed on the 9th floor of the ocean tower with a beautiful oceanfront room. The balconies are very close together but there is enough room to spread things out to dry and still sit down. The view is AMAZING. The room was clean with some wear showing on the wallpaper and in the bathroom. We brought cleaning supplies to wipe everything down but we were pleased with the overall cleanliness of the room. The best perks of the Westin is its location right next to Whalers Village. We saved so much money on food by eating there throughout our stay. The new Cane and Taro restaurant was also very well priced for the large selection that you could choose from. We did do the breakfast buffet at the Westin and were pleased with the quality and the selection. It is comparable to the Hyatt. The pools at the Westin are large, but not as spread out than at the Hyatt. Also there isn't a swim up bar at the Westin which would have been a nice feature. All in all, the grounds at the Westin were nicely kept and good towel service. What does separate the Westin from the Hyatt is the Westin's beach. There is no beach at the Hyatt, the actual cabana chairs are now on the grass to rent as the beach has more or less washed away (except at the very edge of the property on the Lahaina side). The Westin beach is beautiful sand that is spread out with a very easy walk to Black Rock at the Sheraton. We snorkeled and saw sea turtles and several different species of fish. Wow, it was really nice to walk out and jump in the water with such a large beach. That was a big bonus. I would highly recommend taking a helicopter flight around the island if it fits your budget and itinerary. We flew Blue Hawaii and were very pleased with the trip. The guide Chris was very nice, funny and well informed of the island. It was a once in a lifetime experience. I would also recommend the magic show Warren and Annabelle's on Front street. It was VERY FUNNY and a great way to wrap up the trip. The food was also very good at the show and the cocktails were spot on. This show would be great for people of all ages. We met a couple that has been there 14 times!!! Warren is hilarious!!! All in all, we had a very nice stay at the Westin. The service was good, rooms were clean with a little updating needed, pools and grounds were clean, and the food was good. It was an awesome price that we were able to book a package (air, hotel, and car) through Expedia that gave us the freedom to do lots of other things like helicopter and see some shows/nice dinners out. That itself along with location is reason enough to stay at the Westin. They even brought us a bottle of Champagne for our special occasion. I thought that was truly a personal touch. I would stay there again without hesitation (as long as the price was right.) When comparing the Hyatt to the Westin, I'm not sure that a fair comparison can be made. The Hyatt has recently remodeled its outside bar/restaurant area (Umalu) and the overall grounds are more spread out with newer finishes throughout. There is no beach there so that's defintely a downside. For a honeymoon though or anyone really wanting a lot of private time, I would still recommend the Hyatt. Its quieter, more spread out, and has less kids (the Westin had lots of kids). But for the discount we booked the Westin for, I would go back in a heartbeat!!!!. it was truly an awesome vacation and gave us the freedom to do the things we couldn't do before.

There have, on occasion been small customer service issues, but each time it was taken care of by the staff in an efficient and friendly manner.

From the valets who greet you when you arrive to the folks around the pool, we always feel like we are being treated like royalty.

Honestly, other than ordering food or drink around the pool, we haven't eaten in their restaurants much. We just love walking down the beach to the Whaler's Village for dinner on the ocean. However, the meals we have had at the Westin restaurants were all terrific, if a bit pricey. The location of this hotel is ideal. You can walk to Whaler's Village for cheap food court meals and snacks, as well as shopping. You can walk to several great ocean side restaurants, walk to Blackrock for snorkeling, and walk to a few other resorts. Lahaina is a short drive away, as is the grocery store. Kapalua is also a short drive away, where you can find a fabulous sushi place (Sensi). There is also great sushi to be had at the Ritz.

Some of the reviews on this site are very accurate; others may be a little picky. Here is a short list of the some of the highlights and minor issues we ran into. The property around the pool is amazing, there is one poolside cabana that we rented three of our 7 days, its up on a deck at the far side of the pool furthest from the building, the only two person cabana not on the \"stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, its facing the Ocean, it was amazing, very private, sat above the regular pool deck and has a priceless view of the ocean $50 a day and worth every bit of that. Don't bother pre -ordering anything to be placed in room upon arrival - I ordered rose pedals, chocolate strawberries, a flower arrangement and we were supposed to get the free bottle of champagne - everything came eventually but it was all disjointed and really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide the romantic effect at arrival - having to call down to see where rose pedals are in front of your wife kind of kills the surprise! If you get a regular ocean front room it may face Whalers Village and the Ocean will be off to the left, the view is amazing looking out but not so wonderful looking down. Not a big deal, just be prepared. The proximity of the hotel to the town of Lahiana, Kapalua and having whalers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 village next door makes it the perfect location. Blackrock is a short walk away and offers good snorkeling. Couples massage at the spa was the best I have ever had. Wish I could remember her name for you guys. Get a car, parking is easy, if the lot is full vallet is free, drive around, we had such a great time jumping in the car to finds local breakfast joints and just cruising around. Kids -this hotel is perfect for families, we will be back with our two kids, however if you are there for a romantic getaway the hotel is perfect as well.

We had an Ocean View Room in the Ocean Tower, on the top floor (11) with a view of both the ocean and the pools. I'd highly recommend the Ocean Tower over the Beach Tower. Our room was nice, but the air conditioning made a very loud noise, and although we complained, no one came to fix it. Also, when we first got there, there was an old piece of soap still sitting in the soap holder in the shower. The rooms are configured very strangely. The toilet and bathtub/shower are behind a door in a room with no mirror, and the sink is out in the open, so there's no privacy when brushing teeth, putting on makeup, shaving, whatever. I heard that all the rooms were configured like this, as it's an old property. The hotel is more like a 3 and 1/2 star than a 4 star, and it's definitely not a 5 star, except for the location.

A little cold and always busy and active. When booking this package on Expedia, it was between this hotel and its sister hotel down at the end of the beach right next to Black Rock, the Sheraton. The Sheraton prices run a little less than the Westin, but I went Westin as they had a waterslide and I had teenagers. During the evening the Sheraton always has a torch lighting ceremony, and a diver jumsp into the ocean. We would often walk down there to catch that. We slipped into their pool one morning ... much warmer than ours. No waterslide, but I liked their lagoon like pathways. They often would have a hula dancer by the pool in the evening, grassy lawns, more laid back pace than at the Westin which was no focus around pool, and more focus on bar areas, drinks and dinners. Don't get me wrong, the Westin was VERY nice, and the service was great. But when we return, we will most likely book into the Sheraton.

Check-In: We checked in at 6pm it was hassle-free. We we opted to self-park instead of paying $15 per day. However, there was really never any parking after 7pm, so they valet the car for free most nights. They explained there was a $25 resort fee that included water, gym and free internet access. We were aware of this when booking our trip so it was no problem. We started with a partial ocean view in the Beach Tower and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the greatest view, however half way through our vacation we decided to talk to the front desk about an upgrade. We got lucky and we moved to the Ocean Tower and had a room on the 7th floor and boy did we have a spectacular view of the resort and ocean. The room could use some work, wallpaper bubbling and small bathrooms, but we spent time relaxing on the balcony listening to the waves and enjoying the magnificent sunsets. The sunsets were to die for. Beach Tower v. Ocean Tower- The room in the Beach Tower was much larger; bathroom had double sinks, but did not have the best views. Everyone recommended the Beach Tower so I asked for this when we checked in. When we moved to the Ocean Tower, we could tell it was an older building with much smaller rooms and bathrooms, but the views were spectacular. So, it just depends what you really want for your vacation. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the smaller room because we barely spent anytime indoors. Food: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother purchasing food at the hotel. The buffet was $28 per person for breakfast and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear very good things about the hotel restaurants. We even went into Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village to get coffee every morning ($2) and it tasted better than the $4.18 cup of coffee from the coffee bar at the Westin. I also recommend going to Safeway and picking up some groceries for your room. The beach was beautiful and we rented a caba\u00c3\u00b1a at the Sheraton at Black Rock to snorkel for a day. We stayed there two years ago for our honeymoon and enjoyed that resort a lot too. It was well worth it. The snorkeling was superb and we saw many large sea turtles and colorful fish right next to black rock. The Westin pools were relaxing and not too crowded this time of year. We spent most of our time at the adult only pool. The nearby town of Lahaina is very active, full of tourists, and a fun place to visit. I wish we were still there. Take time to look in the art galleries and eat at Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I also recommend making the drive to Paia and eating at Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House because it is well worth the drive and the money. The staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly.

The bed was comfortable. The walls were pretty thin - I could hear a baby crying and kids playing the first two days but luckily nothing too annoying. The hotel's wi-fi network was awful - felt like a dial up connection, would suddenly become disconnected, and wasn't strong enough for me to download anything from iTunes. The pool was great although there are few spots in the shade and they were always taken (I got very sunburned the first day so wanted to stay in the shade the next couple of days). It was convenient that I could check out snorkel gear at the Sheraton and charge to my Westin room so I could snorkle at Blackrock ($8 for an hour seemed like a bargain). Pool service was good - drinks were brought pretty quickly after being ordered. Had a great burger in Ono but overcooked fish there for another meal (I think my order was forgotten under the warmer as several others received their food who arrived after me). Ate a plain but decent caesar salad ($9) at the Sea Dog poolside snack bar and enjoyed a nice dinner at Tropica. I didn't rent a car so no comments about parking, but I appreciated the free hourly shuttle into Lahaina. The spa service was good and included a coed quiet lounge overlooking the ocean but the whirlpool/sauna/steam room area was tiny.

We must have arrived just after all the kids had gone back to school, because it was not \"overrun\" with kids as some of the other postings mentioned. Even so, we spent our pool time at the adult pool and staked out a shady area because the afternoon sun was very hot. Bring lots of sunscreen! They have a great system now to identify guests (and therefore non-guests. When you get your towels you are given a bracelet. Staff also will remove items from chairs if no one has been there for awhile; this allows space for everyone. The beach is clean (not always the case in other countries) although a bit narrower than expected, but it did not feel crowded. The hotel had only 5 beach umbrellas the first day we were there; they had ordered additional ones that arrived before we left. Again, if you are going to spend all day on the beach, you might want to consider renting the chairs and umbrella to have the option of shade. We decided on a mountain view room as were not going to spend any time in the room. Room size was ok; you are really paying for the rest of the resort. The bathroom was clean, no mildew or odor issues as some of the other posters found. Although the room overlooked the parking lot, the view of the mountain side in the morning was lovely. Housekeeping could step it up a bit; we found bits of old food on the floor and also asked them to come back and dust. Some of the staff were outstanding (the Loss Prevention officer who helped with a lost and found issue) some were humorous (the young man at the activities center by the beach that was more interested in talking to his surfing buddies than the guests) and some were puzzling (the concierge that did not want to bother with us??) Overall, pleasant and mostly helpful staff. Our rental car got dinged pretty good while under valet care, but we did not notice until we had been driving around for the day. As other posters have noted, parking at the hotel is challenging and the slots are very narrow. Be sure you know exactly what your car and homeowners insurance covers before renting a car. I did not take out the extra insurance but had no problems with my personal insurance covering the damage. In hindsight, I would have taken the shuttle to the hotel (~$50) and rented a car in Lahaina for the day we wanted one. On a side note, we had great excursions. We did the Sunset Sail and the Snorkel Sail with Gemini Charters. They sail a 64' catamaran that loads at the Westin beach. Great and knowledgeable crew that loves to sail! Captain David, a naturalist, was marvelous. Book online and save 10%. Both trips were well worth the money. We also did a day trip with Ekahi Tours. Our guide, Charlie, graduated from Hana High School. The small group of 12 adults was just right for us. The tour had lots of stops including the winery, Charles Lindberg's grave, the Pools of Ohe'o, Hana, all enhanced with a running commentary of the islands.

Our view resembled the picture on the brochure. We had a lovely time. The staff were efficient, the grounds clean and we had no trouble finding pool chairs. The hotel has stepped up its efforts to discourage those nitwits who would \"reserve\" 4 chairs for 4 hours without getting the towel wet. Staff were present to leave warnings to obviously vacant chairs, and if no one showed up in an hour their stuff was taken off. It made for some interesting evesdropping when the former \"Owners\" came back! We did a fantastic catamaran snorkel trip right off Kaanapali beach through Trilogy. We went to Honolua Bay, up around the north end of Maui. I have taken many such trips to snorkel, and this was hands down the best snorkeling I've ever done, plus we didnt have to leave the hotel at 5:00am to drive to Maalea Harbor....The weather was consistently warm and sunny, and the ocean was warmer than the pools.

The room did have a fridge which was nice and available for use, not one of those that is always fully stocked and you can't move any of the food items or they automatically charge you. Our bathroom was very small and did have some mildew issues. It was not terrible but could have used a good cleaning. The bed was comfy as all \"heavenly beds\" are and the wireless internet was a plus. Housekeeping did seem to start ultra early (like before 8 am), not bad for us since we were up around 6 am most days (still adjusted to East coast time) but could be a negative from some people. The pools were nice with lots of waterfalls and 2 slides. There was definitely a \"family resort\" feel. The majority of guests seemed to be families with small children. So if you don't enjoy being around kids this is not the resort for you. The adult only pool was a lifesaver for us. Our only complaint about the pools was that the water was very cold. They were definitely not heated. I guess they expected the hot Hawaii sun to heat them up. But they definitely remained chilly throughout the entire day. Food at the hotel itself was pretty expensive. We did eat breakfast there most mornings just out of sheer convenience (~$12 per person for a muffin and a breakfast wrap). Drinks around the pool are pricey compared to the mainland, but really pretty much on par for most of Hawaii. ($6+ for beer, $9+ for cocktail). Lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurants was just too much for us. We ate Whaler's Village or took the free shuttle to Lahaina to eat instead. The resort really is in a great location. It is a 2 minute walk to Whaler's Village where you can get just about anything you need. It has a great beach. The surf is relatively calm, it is in great shape, and very clean. The only downside is that they charge you $30 to rent 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for a day. They also offer the free shuttle to Lahaina. This is a great service because unless you are really lucky and get one of the curb side parking spots, parking cost $10 a night in Lahaina. It is worth the $10 just to take the shuttle and not deal with the parking. Overall, I would rate this resort as good but not great. The location is awesome. The pools are nice but cold.

Last year we stayed at the Hyatt Regency, and had a great time. This year we took advantage of an amazing vacation package offered by Costco Travel at the Westin. So we decided to go to Maui again and stay at the Westin. Boy are glad we did. To put it succinctly, the reviews in general do not do justice to the Westin. Many people might be confused about the layout of the hotel. Let me explain as best I can. The best rooms are located at the Beach Tower. Located closest to the beach. In the beach tower the best room are premium ocean deluxe rooms. Most of these rooms face the pool and have a great view of the beach and the ocean. These are even numbered rooms. The ocean deluxe rooms are good rooms but they face Whalers Village and they tend to be nosier. The main building is called the Ocean Tower. The mountain view rooms face the parking lot and highway 30. These have the worst views. The Garden Views rooms are the lower level rooms and your view is aobstructed by the beautiful landscaping on the property. The ocean view rooms face the pool and the ocean but they are located quite a distance from the beach. The beds are very comfortable. The staff is very friendly. The shuttle provided by the hotel is awesome. It takes you to Lahaina. This is great when you've had a few libations.The shuttle also takes you to the Sheraton, and the Westin Villas. (The shuttle is not offered by the Hyatt). The buffet is a pro, although expensive, it was free to us everyday as part of the Costco package. I would not pay the charge of $28.00 for it. The gym is a nice feature free to the guests. The machines face the ocean. Also, the Westin has five pools. One is an adult pool. We never had a problem finding lounge chairs. The beach in front of the hotel is the best. The sand is soft and the ocean is clean. Whalers Village with its restaurants and shops,is located right next door. The have a food court with reasonable prices. The Westin also have happy hours at different locations. Take advantage and get all the free Maui magazines and brochures. They are extremely helpful finding deals throughout the island. As far as negatives, they gave us a handicap room when we first arrived and it smelled like dirty gym socks. When I complained the next morning they happily moved us to a top level non handicap room. Another negative is the parking. Don't get rent a large vehicle. The spaces to park are extremely small, and parking fills up fast. A postive thing is that when the lot is full, they will valet your car for free. The biggest negative is the thin walls. You can hear your neighbors making plans for the day. Getting off the topic of the Westin, here are some tips to enjoy Maui. We enjoyed eating at Ruth's Chris. They have a special for 39.95 and 49.95. Salad, side and steak. One entree order is plenty for two people. The restaurant is located in Lahaina right across from the ocean.

This Hotel was very expensive for us at 400.00 a night but we can say we did it once, this did not include taxes and the kids club. At first we were scared from the reviews, but let me assure you this place is awesome. I think when the people complain thats just who they are. The room was average size with a couch that turned into a bed for our young son. We could see the ocean from the bed... we were on the 10 floor again just awesome. We celebrated my birthday there and they sent us a cake which was waiting when we came home that night. People complained about the walk to blackrock and the other hotels along the beach, its really not that bad. I mean i guess they are not used to walking a couple of blocks ( beautiful views along the walk) My only complaints is that the slide closes too early and the food and drinks are really expensive, ex: 2 mai tais were 24.00 with tip, but at the hula grill they have happy hour at 3pm to 5pm for half price (5.75) and they are very good. In Lahaina there was a resturant with views of the ocean with mai tais for 2.95 during happy hour starting at 11 am and they were good too. When you arrive in maui get all the free books and brochures that are offered at the airport, lots of great deals... we ate at Cheeseburger in Paradise (good), Freds mexican resturant in Kihei (great Fajitas, Ok drinks), Eskimo Candy in Kihei (very good) but not open on the weekends, and having a condo we cooked there sometimes. Go to Costco when you leave the airport, they also have a food court if you are hungry when you arrive. Hilo Hatties has great coupons in those books so use them. We did a few excursions, We went to the Drums of the Pacific Luau at the Hyatt, the food is just ok the kaula pork taste just like carnitas, and stay away from the poi...lol, but the show was really great. We went to Molokini (we used the Four Winds and it takes an hour to get there then when we arrived the water was too rough so they took us to Coral Gardens and it took another 45 min, so we arrived we were the first in the water because we did snuba and they give 30 minutes of snuba after we got back in the boat we ate a hamburger and got back in the water after 15 minutes they said its time too leave. Try a different company, that cost us for 2 Adults and 1 child almost 400.00 with snuba for less than a hour and lunch). We did road to Hana (very beautiful) take mosquito repellent i got bitten several times and didn't know until the next day. We drove up to Haleakula during the day ( wow now we know were they get the pictures for Mars...lol. We snorkled at Black Rock, we saw alot of fish and even a turtle came right by us, I never dreamed they were that big, awesome. We visited the Maui Ocean Center, its nice and most of the fish you see there , you will see when snorkling, but i personally think the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California is the best by far Now if you have children the Westin has a kids club which we found to be a great thing and don't be fooled by the way it reads (first come, first serve) they were not that busy and at times maybe 10 kids in the half day program and two in the full day progarm which we took full advantage of using them for the first 3 days on a 12 day trip. My son (9) loved it and didn't want to leave, they are very good about playing with your child and making projects. Do make reservations just in case they have a rush of kids.

A resort that is truely mimics Hawaii\u201d", "Author": "brigmix", "ReviewID": "UR38672583", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I am in the travel industry. I have taken so many vacations that I cannot count them. I consider myself picky when it comes to traveling, which is having my expectations met based on what type of hotel I am staying in. I require a very clean appearing and smelling room. I will not stay at a place if there are odors. To me the odors are representative of the quality of the housecleaning and managements goals. The people MUST be friendly. I am on vacation and want to be treated that way. Last, there are the conveniences. I think you must have them available on sight or the hotel should make it easy for you to access them (like a shuttle). The Westin Spa and Resort - Kaanapali, exceeded all of these expectations. Upon arrival, my family and I were approached by a staff member before we could even check in. He presented each of my family members with a necklace made from shells (a nice touch and welcome). Upon check in they upgraded us free to the top floor Mountain View room (we had chosen garden level, since we are on a budget). For the first three days we had a message that there was a gift waiting for us. The gift was a box of macadamia nut chocolates. Though it was small a very nice gesture I may add. The room was well appointed, very clean and the beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in (which includes the beds at home). The sheets were luxurious and we had thick down comforters and plenty of pillows soft and firm to choose from. The room is not spacious but was plenty of room for a family of four. My husband and I spent each morning on the balcony (each room has one), and had a beautiful view of the picturesque mountains where the clouds just hang over the mountains makes the rising of the moon a beautiful backdrop. We could see the ocean from our chairs without having to move. The one thing that a prior posting mentioned is that this side faced the parking and you can imagine how loud it is, well that was not the case for us. I never heard anything. So my suggestion is that if you ask for the Mountain View, which is cheaper and a very pleasant experience make sure you are on the upper floors. Each day our room was tended to. We had such a pleasant woman who we saw each day. She fulfilled each request we had with a smile. We were given four bottles of complimentary water each day which was great for the pool stays or road trips we took. Halls were quiet though the elevator was often very full. But that was o.k. going to and from the lobby. It is a resort, what would you expect. The lobby was a beautiful and leisurely place to gather and visit with other people, let alone walk through. The impression I got was that there would be tons of people roaming around making it difficult to traverse your way through the lobby and people area (using a freeway as an example). We were there in the highth of the summer travel season. The lobby is a large (very large) open area, with plenty of outcropping with seating to enjoy the very large pond that extends the entire length of the lobby area. There were many Koi, ducks, swans and flamingos present. My kids loved seeing the fish and flamingos! They lobby was also absolutely gorgeous and well appointed. We spent a portion of each day sitting and visiting down there. They had comfortable seating and views of the large pond and waterfalls. The pools were great for the whole family. The 5 pools are situated at different locations but are all interconnected by small lagoons and channels. One is designed so that you swim through a cave, which is actually a spa area with jets etc. They had an adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only pool which is nice for the couples or for you to get away from kids. We read on some postings that you had to get out by the pool at 9:00 to grab a lounge chair, well we were out there at all times of the day except mornings, throughout the length of our trip and always got four lounge chairs, next to each other, without difficulty for us to use poolside. So I am not sure what the problem was with the others. They had waiters tend to you while you were poolside; bring food and drinks when you needed them. The beach is literally 25 feet from the pool. So it is very convenient for us to play, swim and walk the boardwalk (especially during sunset). We never ate in the restaurants, we never needed to. We were always away from the hotel sightseeing so that was never a concern. When you travel to Hawaii, why would you want to eat in the hotel restaurants? There are so many local restaurants to choose from. Lahina is where the nightlife, shopping and restaurants are. There is a couple of restaurants right around the hotel that are popular and recognizable. Once again, why would you eat at or by your hotel with all that is available in Lahina? The hotels in Kaanapali offer a free shuttle bus that takes you to different places in Kaanapali (beaches and snorkeling spots). Whalers Village is right next door, which offers a little shopping for those die hard shoppers. Ah, now we will speak of the parking that is so unduly noted in almost every posting. The parking is free (well sort of since you do pay a $25 guest fee each day). I cannot tell you how many resorts charge for their parking at outrageous rates. Parking during the day is quick and easy and a short walk to the hotel. At night when you arrive past 7 pm you WILL encounter a line of traffic to find parking. But as another individual noted and I will verify, the parking is then done by valet... free of charge. You pull up to the entrance sometimes three lanes wide, leave your keys in the car and they park it for you. Then the next morning you have them bring your car around, and I must say quickly and efficiently. The valets also offer to get you towels for the beach if you need them or anything else that will make your car trip more comfortable. So I actually think that the parking is a plus... free valet! Now that we are home in California, my family has not stopped talking about their stay at the Westin. This is our third time to Hawaii (other islands) and was by far the most pleasant and enjoyable hotel stay we have had. I must also state that the Westin is top notch and highly rated. I do not believe anyone could be disappointed. The staff was all exceedingly friendly, as well as helpful and were willing to resolve any issue we had quickly and to our satisfaction. We even had one instance where there was a perceived safety issue and the hotel manager himself called us to help resolve the issue.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the type to completely research a place before we visit. The hotel definitely met the expectations my husband and I had for our trip. We did have the discounted $225 a night rate. The lobby and grounds are beautiful, the room was large enough for both of us, and the staff was very pleasant. We did receive one postcard under our room door about a free gift but thanks to the posts here I knew to ignore it since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the time share spiel. Since we had booked most of our activities and restaurants we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to ever see the concierge. We had a mountain/golf course view room in the older Ocean Tower. Since we were very high up and near the end of the hall, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience any of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that others had commented on. While this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most immaculate room we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in, I think people forget it is a beach resort hotel. I found it to be pretty clean considering we ourselves tracked in various sand, dirt and other debris from our various island excursions. We only ate lunch once at the hotel, but the food seemed very good- and yes it is expensive but most of the food on the island is and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most expensive food menu we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comparable to most cities. We stopped at the COSTCO by the airport and bought Vitamin water, snacks, bagels and fruit which we kept in the fridge. The pool area did seem to be pretty full and with a number of families, but Maui in general seemed to be a family destination. If you want seclusion and privacy Lanai or perhaps the Makena area (which reminded us of West Palm in Florida) is a better bet. The best feature of this hotel is the location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only located on the what we consider the best beach in Maui (and yes we did drive the whole island- and see almost every beach) and is at the widest part of the beach, but within walking distance to the black rock (pretty good snorkeling- we saw many sea turtles when we went in), the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village complex and near Lahania. The only strike against the hotel in my opinion is the parking. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the 25 a day resort fee (for those who do I hope you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t travel with a vehicle in any major city/ high cost of living area because trust me 25 a day to park, use the gym, the internet, and for two bottles of water is good deal), but they should just forgo the valet service and open those lots for regular parking and the issue would be solved. This was our first trip to Maui and we were more interested in seeing the island, hiking Haleakala and the rain forests, and the lava fields, driving to Hana, snorkeling and kayaking and swimming in the warm ocean, visiting the towns (Paia is a hidden gem), and going to the best (and local) restaurants (Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish house, the Paia Fish Market and Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were the best). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly 11 hours to sit by a quiet pretty pool all day (we could get that much closer in the Caribbean ), perhaps for those who just wanted that had a different experience. One last tip- If you plan on touring the island (especially the road to and past Hana) rent a Jeep. We were torn between a convertible and Jeep and with the conditions of the road (many passes only fit one vehicle, and some of it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even paved) and to add to the sight line the Jeep was indispensable.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but crowded, noisy and average rooms\u201d", "Author": "Georgeamazing", "ReviewID": "UR37415603", "Content": "Let's start by saying that the expectations placed on this hotel by us were very high to begin with. This is because of the price of the hotel. We took the 225 dollar a night deal that Starwood was offering for this hotel. Usually it can be from 400-800 USD a night. We arrived in Maui through an independent shuttle bus service from Kahului airport. Our first impressions of the hotel made it seem like paradise. The lobby was magnificent and probably the best part of the hotel. It was just like nothing you have ever seen before. Unbelievable and the designer of the lobby should get 5 stars for this alone. We checked in with the front desk who were friendly throughout our entire trip and were upgraded from a garden view to a mountain view (not much of an upgrade - but nonetheless got a better room). We were placed on the top floor in the older ocean tower. This showed in the elevators we took up which were well below average. The hallway seemed decent enough but as soon as we got in our rooms we were appalled. The room itself was small, the washrooms had a horrible odor and most of all they gave us a connecting room. We could hear the couple next door having a normal conversation. Can't complain - you can't really fault someone for talking. So we asked for a room change in which we were denied because they were full. So we stuck it out and tried to fall asleep when the couple next door was out - this worked for the days we were here and we had otherwise no problems making it through the night. Facilities: Great pool area and fantastic location right on the beach. The pool was large and amazing for pictures and just pure enjoyment. We spent a lot of time here. The only downside is that if you hate kids, you will hate this place. Kids everywhere, running from pool to pool. To receive some tranquility, we had to head out to beach which was way more peaceful and less kids due to the fact that the water gets deep FAST. Beach chairs were always signed out so you had to get one early. Amenities: Free wireless high speed internet in the room kept us connected and a free shuttle to Lahaina town (which has a ton of shops for souvenir shopping and restaurants for dinner) was very much appreciated although it was full a lot of the time (so you had to wait for the next one). It came every hour. The restaurants were extremely pricey (what did you expect - comparable to a resort of this caliber) but the food was delicious. Free shopping bag, free 4x6 portrait taken professionally and 2 free bottles of water are all included in a 25 dollar/day resort fee. Location: Perfect - on the beach and right next to Whaler's village, a small shopping plaza that was enjoyable. We walked through this at least 8 times as sometimes this was the only place to get stuff. Lahaina town is about 10 minutes by shuttle and is also a nice little town with a wide variety of shopping. Overall, nice staff, great lobby, and definitely paradise when you are out of your room. When you are in your room, you feel like this is a 100 USD lower end hotel.

Unfortunately, this property is now on my \"never return\" list. Everything was great until we got there. The concierge desk (NOT the Timeshare \"personal\" concierge) was extremely helpful and provided us with menus of restaurants and put us in touch with activities beforehand. They were a pleasure to deal with. Unfortunately, the \"personal\" concierge even went as far as to contact me on my cell phone to let me know of the great package they had for me if I would only come downstairs to see her. If you want to email me, leave me a note in the room (which they did, twice), or leave a message on my room phone, that is all fine by me. It is just something about receiving a call on your phone that is a little irksome. But I digress... The hotel grounds are very nice. Very open, very expansive. Everything is very nicely appointed and well-maintained. There was very little litter to be found anywhere. There are several pools and many lounge chairs, but very little in terms of shade. If you come out to the pool after 7am, you will have no luck in finding shade, and a difficult time finding a chair at all. However, the pool does empty in the afternoons, and starting about 3pm you will have no problems at all. You have to get a wrist-band to get towels, and are told that each unreturned towel will result in a $25 charge. This is essentially unenforceable however, as once they close the towel shack in the early afternoon, you can take and leave towels as you please. The pools are unheated, which I was not expecting. The ocean water actually felt a tad bit warmer. Later in the day (since the hotel blocks the sun from the east until about mid-day) the water will warm up a bit. We also had room service a few times, most of the food being the same as the 'Ono menu. It was slightly more expensive in some instances, but as SPG Platinum you receive 20% off room service (but not at the restaurant itself) so if you want to eat in the room it will actually be cheaper than going downstairs. There are other discounts Golds and Platinums receive (spa, etc.), but we only used the room service one. Now on to the stay...unfortunately it did not live up to expectations...I put in our reservation notes and contacted the hotel directly before our stay, letting them know that I was there in part for my birthday and in part for a wedding, travelling with my wife and our six month old daughter, and that I would appreciate any accommodations they would be able to provide us. Unfortunately, that seemed to have meant putting us in a room directly adjacent to an elevator. This does not bode well when you have a six month old infant. I am not one to return and complain, especially after I gave ample opportunity to take care of us right the first time. Strike one. Being a destination wedding, I was able to convince one of my friends who would also be out in Maui to stay at the Westin as well. He is a taller person, and pre-paid for a room with a King-sized bed. We he arrived it was about 45 minutes before typical check-in time (2:15 or so), so after the desk agent took all of his information, she asked for his cell phone number so that they could call him since his room was not ready and let him know when it would be. Over 3 hours passed by and there was no phone call. He returned to check-in and was given no explanation. He entered his room to find it was two doubles, not the King like he had already pre-paid. He was unable to switch rooms. Strike two. I mention this story about my friend because he will now most likely not give Starwood another chance, and my recommendation did not live up to expectations. The individual who took my friend's phone number and failed to call at check-in also had a rather unfortunate experience with us on our last day as well. I went down in the morning of our last day to request a late check-out. As always, when I know that I will need a late check-out in advance, I will mention it at check-in as a sign of courtesy. The agent informed me that it wouldn't be a problem and that worst case I would have to change rooms. Our departure flight was later in the evening, and our daughter needed to take a nap. When I asked the individual who dealt with my friend about a possibly late check-out, I was immediately told that the hotel was sold out and that I had to check-out at noon. Unfortunately for her, I also have the SPG application on my iPhone and just minutes earlier verified that there were in fact several rooms available. I let her know of this, to which she asked for my room number and said that my room was blocked for an arriving honeymoon. I then asked if I could change rooms, as per the check-in agent, but was told that I would incur a charge. My response to this was that I would in fact not incur a charge because I was a Platinum SPG member and late check-out, if available, was one of my benefits. Her immediate reply to this was that I was not Platinum. I asked why she would presume such a thing, to which she replied that I was not marked as a Platinum. Again, I knew this was incorrect as I had not only made the reservation as a Platinum (so my reservation did not need to be refreshed), but I also put it in my reservation notes, in the email I sent to the hotel directly (to which I received a confirmation of receipt by a reservation agent), but when I checked in I was given my Platinum amenity. I let her know that she was incorrect, reiterated our need for a 4pm late check-out because our infant daughter needed to take a nap, and to please check again. She excused herself to the back area, came back a few minutes later, and presented me with a key to another room. Strike Three. Going in, do I really expect a sweet upgrade? When the hotel is empty, yes I do. I will tell you that we will definitely return to the Sheraton Hacienda in Cabo because of the upgrade and how we were treated. The Westin was fairly full, but a room next to an elevator? That's where I'd imagine you put people who booked via Priceline. I'd recommend staying at the Sheraton (on Black Rock) or the Westin Villas if you want to be near Ka'anapali, so what if their pools don't have a slide?", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice, but not the Four Seasons\u201d", "Author": "L0vedGreece", "ReviewID": "UR37089539", "Content": "THE ROOMS.

There were maybe five feet between the foot of the bed and the dresser. My wife and I were on the second floor with a garden view room. These rooms were probably five feet wider than the sixth floor room. It made a big difference. Thus, I would recommend that you spend the extra money if you are going to be spending time in the room or if there are more than two people to a room. THE POOLS. The slides, the tunnel, and the waterfalls are excellent. The two north pools, however, are noticeably colder than the two southern pools. Unfortunately for the children, these two pools are where all the children congregate due to the kiddie slide, the basket ball hoop and the volleyball net. So after about an hour in the pool, our blue-lipped, chattering-toothed monsters had to get out to warm up. It is that cold. On the positive side, the Westin has a policy that prohibits the guests from going to the pool early, laying a towel and a sacrificial magazine on the lounger, and calling it yours for the rest of the day. Pool staff will place a notice on the lounger warning you of the policy. After an hour the staff will remove your items if they are still unaccompanied. We applaud this policy. We felt compelled to go stake our claim on the first day. After we learned of the policy, however, it freed us up from having to go to the pool earlier than we would have otherwise wanted. Many of the chairs are in the sun, at least part of the day. They do have covered chairs and cabanas available for rent ($55 for two covered chairs, $90 for large cabana that fit 8). We rented a cabana one day and it was the best decision we made all day -- we should have called in advance of our trip and reserved a cabana for our entire stay. You have padded lounge chairs, plenty of towels and a cooler which they supply with water and ice (we put our snacks in their as well). You also get much better service. More importantly, you get a break from the sun to reapply sunscreen, give the kids a rest, etc. The sun is bright, hot and scorching -- despite putting on sunscreen throughout the day, we all burned. THE SERVICE. There were a couple of experiences we had with the staff that were troublesome. We reserved and paid for (in advance) a \"Garden View\" room. Upon check-in, we were told that we had been upgraded to a mountain view room on a higher floor. When we got to our room, it was clear that it was not an upgrade -- the room was small, with two double beds (we requested a king) and had a parking lot view. We went back to the front desk to request our original (non-upgraded) reservation, and were told that they were full. So, the truth came out. It wasn't an upgrade -- it was what they had available. In fairness, we stayed in the (non-upgraded) room for one night and the next day they moved our stuff into the originally reserved room. Interestingly, when we asked for a late checkout on the day of departure, we were told that we couldn't have one because the hotel was sold out for the evening and guests were guaranteed check-in at 3 pm. Query why this policy didn't work in our favor when we were checking in. We went to the poolside restaurant and had a seat. Three waitpersons passed us by without giving us a second look. We managed to flag down a fourth waitperson who was wearing a uniform, nametag and apron. We asked if he could get us a couple of drinks. His response was that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am off right now, but let me get someone over her to help you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will tell your waiter and your order will be out shortly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This attitude may result from the sheer number of guests at the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel that will cater to your needs on your hard-earned vacation, your may have to step it up a notch. For example, we went to the Four Seasons for lunch. At least three different waitpersons visited our table, each with a polite smile. Our glasses never ran dry. The second incident came at the poolside towel cabana. Inside the cabana there are several pool accessories available for sale. My father asked the attendant the price of an item and was shrilly told, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now the attendant could not have known that my father is blind in one eye and has poor vision in the other. It does not matter. There is no excuse for not being polite. Why not give a polite response or just answer the question. THE FOOD. Of the Westin's restaurants, we only ate at Ono. They have a pool or beachside brunch for ~$30 per person, which was fairly good. We are not big eaters so we certainly didn't eat $30 worth of food, but everything in Maui (including cereal purchased at the grocery store, which was $7 per box) is more expensive than on the mainland. There are certainly cheaper places to eat for breakfast -- one that we tried and thought was comperable was the Kanapali Resort (next door to Westin), which had an all you can eat brunch for $18. After that, EAT NOTHING ELSE AT ONO. You may be tempted because of the convenience, but if you want food that actually tastes good, get off your lounge chair and walk down the beach to one of the other nearby beach-side restaurants. Don't get me wrong, the food is not down right nasty, but it's not good (on a scale of 1-10, I rate it a 4-5) and it's expensive. The burgers were OK and the kids liked their tripple-decker PBJ sandwiches (of course). The lava flows are delicious (one of the better we had), so if you do eat at Ono, order a lava flow to wash it down and you won't care nearly as much! THE SPA. The spa was nice. Upon arrival, you're given a robe and slippers to change into and then escorted to a waiting lounge with an assortment of hot tea, fresh squeezed lemonade, water w/ cucumber and lime and various dried fruits and almonds to nibble on. You can also order lunch in between services, but we didn't do so. I had the 80 min. heavenly massage, and I was glad I paid for the extra 30 min. The masseuse was nice and had good pressure, but at times I felt her strokes were too fast, as though she was in a hurry. On a scale of 1-10, I rate my massage a 7. I had no problem making my reservation the day before, which was nice. Moreover, my mother-in-law, father-in-law and three sisters-in-law were able to make appointments for their treatments at the same time (all of us booked the day before). They thoroughly enjoyed their treatments (wraps, facials and massages) and we enjoyed sitting in the lounge and chatting in between treatments. The chairs in the lounge were not the most plush and relaxing I've ever had, but they were comfortable. Overall, our spa experience was relaxing and fun -- which is what we were looking for. OVERALL. This is a great place to stay if you have kids. There are scheduled activities for them all day long, day and evening \"kids camps\" so the parents can get a break and many large pools with fun slides, waterfalls, etc. The rooms are nice, and the beds and showers are indeed \"heavenly\" (at least as compared to the usual hotel beat-down). If you don't have kids or are looking for something a little quieter, this is not the place for you. Overall, we felt the resort was nice, and a good place to entertain the monsters, but quiet and relaxing do not describe the overall atmosphere. If I were traveling without kids, I'd have preferred the Four Seasons (in fairness, we've never stayed there with or without kids, but when we were there for lunch, I was sorry we hadn't made our reservation there).", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for 1st timers to Maui\u201d", "Author": "Ciscoho", "ReviewID": "UR36931140", "Content": "We read a lot of reviews about the Westin Maui Resort & Spa before going and most of the pros and cons turned out to be very accurate. On the con side, the rooms were rather small and a bit dated. If you have young children, you would appreciate a larger bathroom with newer amenities for bathing the kids. The parking lot was always quite full and finding an available parking space was challenging but they did offer free valet service to guests when spaces were hard to find. The drawback was that you felt obligated to tip the valets for something you were not at fault for having to do. Other small items which does make a difference were the very dated and small refridgerator provided in each room and a pretty clunky microwave oven that was provided to us. Lastly, the Heavenly beds is more of a marketing gimmick than anything as I found the beds and linen to be average. Certainly did not meet the expectations that was built up from the advertising. In fact, the amount of linen was actually rather more cumbersome than comfortable. Overall, I would rate the rooms to be 3 stars only but the entire complex would be 4 stars. On the good side, the resort had lots of pools and activities which is great for young families who do not wish to venture out every day. Our kids aged 2 and 7 loved it. There were plenty of exotic wildlife which fascinated the kids. Whaler's Village was right next door and offered good shopping. As well, Lahaina was less than 10 minutes away which was convenient for grocery shopping at the local Safeway for breakfast and brunch foods. After a couple of days we got a little tired of the local restaurants (Ono, Tropica, Leilani's etc.) so we ventured out to Lahaina and outlying areas for meals. You can find more reasonable restaurants around so eating does not have to be expensive as everyone says. The staff overall was very friendly and helpful. You don't need to spend money joining the snorkeling tours as there is decent snorkeling just off the beach in front of the hotel. Also, just a couple of miles down the road at Black Rock is very good snorkeling for free as well and you can even see the sea turtles there. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay as the hotel location was very convenient and the pools and facilities were great for for kids. I would definitely go back without hesitation but wouldn't mind exploring for some similar alternatives first.

We booked through Expedia, using one of their 24 hour sales, with an absolute great rate hotel + car. Booking through Expedia vacation (hotel + car) won't get you any points if you are a SPG member (it's wholesale price), so look how deep are the discounts before booking through a third part. We thought that a wholesale rate would put us in the worst room of the hotel. Actually, we got a good upgrade when we get there, a room with ocean view (a direct view of black rock and the Whaler's village, which is right beside the hotel), with a king size bed and a sofa bed (the sofa bed was actually quite comfortable, and I don't really like to sleep on them). One of the reviewers complained about noise at the Whaler's village (and also construction noise). We really did not have a problem with that, in fact, we haven't heard any noise at all, although it is also true that we tended to wake up earlier to have breakfast and go to the beach (we were rarely in our rooms after 9am, especially in the first days of the vacation, where we tend to get up even earlier, due to the time difference between mainland US and Hawaii. The room was quite nice. A little stain on the carpet - no big deal. It had a flat screen tv, a fridge, and safe, plus a desk with various connections for your computer and various outlets (very convenient if you have things to charge: cameras, cell phones, portable dvd players). We didn't bring our laptop, but I think we would be able to plug a laptop to the room's flat screen. Based on some reviews, we thought the rooms would be tiny but our room was not too bad (although not too spacious either). No problem at all with service and reception - everybody was quite helpful and friendly. The highlight of the hotel was the grounds (beautiful, well manicured) and the swimming pool. There are 5 swimming pool (one adult only). The \"adult\" area has the pool, a bar, and a hot tub. The other 4 pools are interconnected. 2 of them are interconnected through a passage where you swim through two waterfalls and where there is a hidden whirlpool. There is a small kid slide, and also a very fun water slide (you need to be able to swim and cannot wear floating devices). Great for kids. Some reviewer mentioned some fine for not returning the towels. We didn't find any problem with that - they actually did not count how many towels you check and return (but ask for your room number when checking in). I wonder how they would charge for not returning the towels with this lax control. We did, however, had some problem finding a free pool chair (so we were never by the pool at peak time). There are several restaurants at the premises (we haven't used them, they were quite expensive, in our opinion). There is an artificial lake, with waterfalls, flamingos, ducks, swans, and (giant) colored fish. Great location at Kaanapali beach. Whaler's village is right beside the hotel. Best way to get there is through the beach walk. The stretch of beach in front of the Westin is pretty decent, although the best part of the beach, in my opinion, is the area close to Black Rock, a short walk from the Westin. I think the highest point for the Westin is that it is in a terrific location to watch the sunset on the sea. Make sure you are at the hotel for the sunset, it is incredible. The Westin charges $25 of resort fee, that includes the parking (see comment below), 2 bottles of water per day, and free internet (which we didn't use). It's mandatory, so consider the fee when comparing hotel rates (BTW, all resorts charge fees of ~$20. Now, some quibbles: - parking lot, as some reviewers mentioned, is quite small. The spots are narrow, and there aren't to many of them. The good news is that if the lot fills up, they start to valet park your car without charges (if you want valet all day, you'll have to pay another $10 in addition to the resort fee). However, most of the time, you feel like in a crowded mall, when you look for incoming people leaving to grab their spot. It can be annoying, if you enter and exit the lot a couple of times, and also a waste of time. - eating inside the hotel is quite expensive, even the breakfast. You walk to the Whaler's village for breakfast, but they don't open until 7:30am (bad for early birds who haven't yet adjusted to the Hawaiian time). And to go anywhere else, you need to drive (and deal with the parking problem). - hotel feels a bit crowded. We've heard that the hotel was not completely full, due to the economy woes, so I wonder how it would look like at full capacity. - no microwave oven - it would be very useful. - check if resort is for you. We've learned that staying in a resort may not be worth the extra bucks if you spend most of time elsewhere - the pool may get a bit old after a while. All in all, you can really go wrong with the hotel, especially if you have kids, but I would not stay here if it were not for the deep discounts.", "Date": "August 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cMake sure you get a rate with breakfast included\u201d", "Author": "christens02", "ReviewID": "UR36698680", "Content": "We had a rate of $290 per night. That included the breakfast buffet for 2 each day. If you're planning to spend the day out and eat the big breakfast anyway, you may be able to find a rate like this. I don't know that I would pay more than that for this room. The rooms were generally nice. There was a large bar area in our room that seemed to take up a lot of space, but over the 4 days we were there, I came to appreciate the extra space. For some reason, I didn't feel like the bed was as comfortable as other beds I have had at other hotels, particularly Sheraton/Westins. I can't put my finger on why. The resort fee includes many things, including high speed internet. They have the wired connection in the room, but I think they only have wireless now. Neither I nor my sister could get the wired connection working at any time. Drinks were \"only\" $9 here. That's less than many other hotels in Hawaii, but by the time I got here, I was basically sick of fruity drinks. I did enjoy my chocolate-coconut-pineapple smoothie for $6 just as much. Also, I really liked the triple decker PBJ from the kids menu, which they let me order. We really liked the Ono restaurant. It's listed as a tapas type place, but one item is really enough. Or one and split a salad. There is a dessert there that I think is called the chocoholic.. It's a GIANT dessert. Two of us couldn't finish it. It was so big that I made up a story about it to tell my niece for story time that night. Our favorites were probably the grilled cheese, the greens salad, and the ahi sandwich. LOVED the pool and the slide. Note that when it's windy, it's very cold to stand in line for the slide. The sand on the beach is suboptimal for sandcastles, so if you're a serious sandcastle maker, don't waste your money on the sand toys. You're better off with a single bucket from the dollar store (I brought mine from home). Note that it's usually windy and that inflatables have a tendency to blow away. We almost lost our beach ball several times. There is a pool under the waterfalls between two of the pools. It looks like a whirlpool, but it's not heated like one. It does provide a pool out of the wind, which is where we went to play with our beach ball eventually. You do need to go to the towel desk and get a wrist band before they'll let you down the slide. The lobby includes a waterfall, large pond with koi, swans, and flamingos. Do go down and feed the fish. They let grown adults do it too. Took my surf lesson here. It was $70 for a group 2 hour lesson. I had 23 people in my lesson group, which seemed like too many. However, I was glad I had the rest between times paddling out. I understand that the 8 am group is usually smaller and that there are usually better waves. I had a nice time with the 11 am group. There is also a 2 pm group, but I don't know anything about that one. The people taking private lessons seemed to be having a nice time as well, but I don't know about that cost. I do want to ding them for a couple of things. First, we requested late check out (which we were entitled to as gold members), as our plane wasn't until 5 pm. We had to argue until finally they let us keep one of our two adjoining rooms until 1 pm. The adjoining door was open, and they didn't clean that room during the time that we were there, so I don't know why they insisted on only letting us have one of them. Also, it seemed like the housekeeping staff was on the verge of greatness, but couldn't get everything together. One time they remembered everything except leaving water. The next time, they forgot to leave coffee, the next time cups, the next time towels. I don't know what the problem was. It wasn't a huge deal, but it was aggravating to have to call down every day to get something. They always brought it promptly, however. We stayed in a mountain view room, and it was very nice. Note that you'll be facing east, so close your curtains if you want to sleep later than 6 and you want it to be dark.

The room: We upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View and yes, you could see the ocean to the left, but directly in front of us were the rooftops of Whaler's Village. I don't usually care what I'm looking at since I don't spend that much time on the balcony, but the noise was awful! The first morning we awoke at 5am to construction going on at Whaler's! Besides that, there are delivery trucks bringing food to the hotel at that hour! Every morning, we could hear the trucks beeping and the big steel doors opening and closing! There is also a parking lot there, so we often heard motorcycles starting up at all hours. I complained to the front desk, but of course they told me that they were booked and could not change our room. I talked to the manager and he said he had other complaints about the construction noise, so the hotel talked to them and they said they wouldn't start until 9am. It didn't matter at that point because the food delivery trucks and parking lot noise wasn't going to change. The room was fine, nothing special. The bathroom was dull, but at least the toilet was separate. The lobby: Nice, but the pond had an unpleasant smell when you walked by. The pool: Nice pool with a great waterslide (the main reason we chose to stay there). The downside was having to get to the pool early enough to get lounge chairs! Even though there were 4 of us, we would only take 2 chairs because we aren't selfish jerks like some people! My kids didn't need lounge chairs because they spent most of the time in the pool. When they would get out to eat lunch, we would just have them sit at the foot of our chairs and eat. No reason to take up chairs for other adults. I can't tell you how many people would have 4 or 5 chairs saved with towels and toys and they would never be used! Just because you have 3 kids with you, you don't need 3 chairs for their toys to sit on! We put our unused pool toys under our lounges, and rafts behind our chairs. It's really simple people! One day, we came down to the pool at 8am, and there were 2 chairs saved with towels already, so we took the 2 empty ones next to them, and a few hours later there were still no people. Finally, someone asked me if they were being used. I told them that they had been sitting unused for hours. So they got the pool staff to remove the belongings. Around 3pm, a couple shows up and starts looking around those chairs for their stuff! They asked me if I had seen their stuff, and when I told them, they acted annoyed that their stuff was moved! Seriously!!!?? You saved your chairs from 8am-3pm and expected your stuff to still be there!? They really need a better system at the pool. 4th of July was a joke at the pool! I think the locals get a room for next to nothing and then they invite all their friends and family to join them at the pool! All you have to do is give them a room number/name and you get a wristband to get you in the pool. We had a family of approx. 20 next to us! They had the lounge chairs facing all different directions and they had all their stuff strewn everywhere! It was nuts! They acted as if they were in their own backyard! The drinks at the pool were just ok. Not good enough for $12 for a \"Westin\" Mai Tai! They have a regular Mai Tai for a little less, but it sucks! It was bitter and gross. I had a horrible margarita there too. The food at the pool was pretty good though! After many pool days, we decided to get chairs on the beach one day. I stood in line for about 20 minutes to have the guy say he only had 2 more chairs left. I was the 3rd person in line, so I left and got chairs at the pool again. Bummer.

The pool does get filled up pretty quickly but we spent most of our time at the beach and came back to the pool towards the end of the day (3-4pm) and were able to find chairs easily. We did get a beachside cabana one day which was nice but came with a hefty $60 pricetag. A huge negative with the pool area is that theres only ONE teeeeny tiny hot tub in the adult pool area. That thing can probably fit 4 or 5 people max at a time which is unacceptable!! Build a new hot tub!!! The beach here is great as well compared to the other hotels, when you get to the Hyatt side you can definitely see the erosion of the beach during high tide. Food is expensive at the resort but its expensive everywhere in Maui unless you really do some research and try to hit up some local spots.

The room was superbly decorated and looked very fresh. The bathroom was amazing and had a large selection of free toiletries which my wife became addicted to :D But the number one thing about the room had to be the bed! it was so comfortable and huge and from lying in it you could look right out at the pacific and hear it lapping against the shore.

The staff was monitering those who left and did not return within an hour. We left to get breakfast and came back with a note on our chair. They would have picked up our towels and books 25 minutes later. We never experienced any issues with children. Even in the elevators the children were very well behaved. Is the food expensive - yes. However, there is both a Costco and Safeway on the way to the resort and a refrigerator in the room. There is also an ABC store next door to the resort. Along with a food court. We bought some items at ABC that were very reasonable. Once again, since this was a treat we indulged within reason. We ate the breakfast buffet once and then decided to split an omelet on other days. Ask for the ocean view side. We ate at Barefoot Bar ( food ok - sunset magnificent) and then other places on the island the rest of the meals. We did a sunset cruise on both the Teralini and Gemini. They both were on the beach outside of the Westin. The Gemini is recommended by the Westin. We knew they had internet specials and both honored the discounted prices even though we called instead of booking on line. We preferred going direct instead of using the hotel conceirge. I would highly recommend this for the location and the beach. We walked up and down and found that the Westin has the best beach area.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed - Rooms are the worst I've ever seen for a Westin\u201d", "Author": "DMAttorney", "ReviewID": "UR34270213", "Content": "I was paying $400 per night at Westin, so I was expecting it to be like other Westins - great.

Instead she chose a 10 day trip to Hawaii. I have been fortunate to have trveled to many places in the world and Hawaii was one place I never had much interest in visiting. I was pleasantly surprised by the natural beauty of the place and by the incredible volcanos. The Westin was perfect for this type of trip. Friends recommended the Four Seasons and I felt as if this was a little too romantic for me and my teenage daughter. The Westin was great because it was luxurious, on the beach and was in a perfect location. My daughter and I are foodies and we found so many incredible restaurants nearby. We rented a car and went to Lahaina, many memorable restaurants, one of which was the Plantation Restaurant in Kapalua. The fish tacos at Lelani's were wonderful for lunch and the Hula Grill (same owner) was a favorite too. Both are steps away from the Westin. Make sure you ask for the robes at the Westin. Be advised that the Westin charges $25 per day for the amenities. Personally, this charge should be included in the room charge. I don't think the added charge makes any sense because you have to pay it. A little trick is there are only 10 beach umbrellas so if you want to sit on the beach under an umbrella get to the desk by the beach by 8 AM and they open it up at 8:30 AM. There are always 10 people there by 8:30 AM so get there early. The food at the Westin is pricey for the quality and there are so many great nearby restaurants that I would highly recommend venturing out. The beds are super comfortable and we had a room with a golf mountain view. We hardly were in our room and we paid much less for this splendid view. It was beautiful.

There's a slide at the pool and birds & fish in the lobby. If you're a childless couple looking for a quiet, relaxing getaway -- this hotel is not for you. We were so unable to relax, we left mid-stay and went to the Four Seasons in Wilelia. Some details: The pool area is a zoo. It's a free-for-all when it comes to finding chairs; most people head down by 8am to stake claim for their family for the entire day. There's no pool-side staff to help you find chairs or enforce \"vacant\" chairs. What's remaining (if anything) are undesirable chairs, in the bright sun, next to screaming children. The pool area is also a mess; there's service items and old towels strewn everywhere. It smelled like urine one day. There is an adult-only pool, but there are so few chairs that there's never anything open. The sounds of screaming children permeate this area as well. You also need to check-in and check-out towels from a towel shack -- with the threat of being charged if you don't check-in your towels at the end of the day. Huh? You can get a somewhat relaxing experience by getting a beach cabana. It's not really a cabana -- it's a two seat deck chair with a retractable awning. Unfortunately, they're $60 for the day, and guess what: there's always a screaming kid nearby. You can snag a chair & umbrella on the beach for $15, but they're first-come first-serve, and are filled-up by breakfast. The food at the poolside restaurant & the main hotel restaurant Tropica were average to below average. The spa facilities were clean and above average, but the actual services (stone massage) were below average. The Beach Tower room was passably clean, but not actually clean. Felt like it needed a spring cleaning. The front desk staff was hit or miss. When you got a nice person, they were terrific. When you got a cranky one, boy were they cranky. Free parking wasn't free at all: the cost was headaches and not enough spaces. I conceded to $15/day valet to not stress over this. All in all, this hotel was what you'd expect for a Westin that was adjacent to a Convention Center or a business district in a city: decent and dependable.

The Ocean Tower can suck if you have a room facing away from the pool towards Whaler's village (odd numbered rooms) as you get the restaurant \"smell\" - think sizzling steak aroma.

You have easy access to a wonderful Beach and great shopping at Whaler's Village. I am so glad we chose the Westin over the Hyatt and Sheraton. For a convienence matter, the other hotels should not be an option. The pool at the Westin is definitely colder than the average pool, although it sure felt great after a hot long day.

Kimo's is always fun in Lahaina. Best burgers in Lahaina is Cool Cat Cafe (lunch). Always enjoy hitting the Napili Kai Resort at the Sea House Restaurant for breakfast overlooking the beach and then hitting the beach. Wesin's pool was better for the kids than the Sheraton. Great waterslide and pool. They hand out towels at 7am. Save them for next day to reserve lounges say 4am to 6am (no worries if you're still on CA time). Get 2-4 lounges under huge umbrellas at base of waterslide to view your children. Pick the two off to the far right.

I use TripAdvisor extensively when planning vacations and admit some of the mixed reviews of this property had me worried. If you have kids or are tolerant of families let me put your mind at ease- the resort is awesome. Expensive, but awesome. We requested the Ocean Tower with the slightly larger rooms and were glad we did. It's indeed closest to the beach and both the breakfast buffet and the best of the five pools are literally steps from elevator. Ignore the complaints about the distance from the lobby- it's a two minute walk past waterfalls, koi ponds, flamingos and parrots that delighted my kids, ages 4,9 and 13- every time we passed. Rooms were crisp, clean and modern- typical Westin. The well-used bed and linens were a touch less \"heavenly\" than what I've expereinced elsewhere but still above average. The resort is lush and beautiful, We brought flashlights and had fun and productive nightly \"gecko hunts.\" Every morning they have timed races on the big waterslide- an activity that even made my teenage daughter break character and act like a kid again! Much has been written about the pool chair situation. We read the reviews, fell in line, and made sure we ate early and were at the pool before 9am every morning. No problems. We never reserved more than three chairs, because we're cool. Most people are considerate but there are tools at any resort that can spoil the \"aloha.\" Don't blame the resort or generalize about the class of people around you. Negotiate for the free daily breakfast buffet package- the food is great and it helps defray the bloated cost of the everything else you eat/drink on property or in Maui. Also stop at Safeway or Costco and use the in-room fridges for saved $ on drinks and snacks. The Hula Grill right next door was the best food/value/view we encountered.

If you find that relaxing, this is the place for you! You will spend your entire time at the pool fighting for chairs. Let me start by saying this is my first review of a hotel ever. My husband and I travel frequently and typically stay at Westin, Marriott, JW Marriott, etc. In the past two years, we have been to Hawaii twice, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, along with several smaller trips. I am by no means a \"high maintenance\" woman. I am a low-maintenance type athlete gal and have never been to a spa, had my nails done, etc., so this is not coming from some woman who expects everything to be at her beckon call. Check in was smooth. The lobby is very nice, but deceptive to what you will find in the rest of the hotel. We went to our room and it is exactly as other reviewers on here stated. I have never seen such a tiny room with such low ceilings and for some reason, they have decided to see exactly how much furniture they can cram into the room. You can barely move. The rooms are very worn, old, and crusty - certainly not up to typical \"Westin\" standards. It was one of those hotels that you wanted to have your shoes on whenever walking on the flooring because it was so disgusting. Basically, they have tried to gloss over a very outdated, old hotel. You can hear EVERYTHING your neighbors say, every time a door closes, a toilet flushes, etc. I cannot recall a hotel that I have been in that had such thin walls. The same dirty room service food would be left in the hallways for you to walk past for the entire day, sometimes multiple days. What topped everything off and made me decide I needed to write a review was today's event at the pool. My husband and I approached two completely empty pool chairs with absolutely nothing around them, which is a rare occasion to find at this hotel. You have to \"hunt\" chairs like you are an animal because people place towels on the chairs at sunrise and then don't use them the entire day. We placed our items on the chairs and some guy swam across the pool to very rudely state that those were his chairs even though nothing was on or near the chairs. I am typically a rather shy person and I actually ended up in a heated argument with this guy until I finally walked away and decided he was not worth it. For the most part, the crowd here has their nose in the air in an attempt to pretend they are something they certainly are not. The crowd is a bunch of wanna-bes trying to pretend like they are \"high-rollers\". I have never seen people so obnoxious and stuck on themselves. Staff is not much friendlier - certainly not the \"Aloha\" spirit you expect when in Hawaii. In general, this place is an absolute zoo. It is chaotic , crowded, and far from relaxing. Do not go here if you are looking to relax and have a stress free vacation! I wish I had went with my gut after reading other reviews on here and stayed away from this place. Parking - every evening when you return the self-park area is full and you are forced to valet your car. You have no choice. They are very \"generous\" and do not charge you extra to valet your car, but they stand there and stand there and stand there waiting for their tip. Now, if I choose to valet a car, I certainly leave a tip because that is an expected protocol of using the valet. I do not expect to tip someone everytime I want to go somewhere because I was forced to valet because the self-park lot is ridiculously small. There are numerous other items that made this hotel less than stellar, but I have already typed a book.

Gorgeous open lobby area with a koi fish stream, black swans and flamingos basking in the warm Hawaiian sun. Our room was in the Beach Tower, which was quite a walk from the hotel front desk. We paid for an ocean view, but the ocean was really out the side of our balcony and the room actually faced the Whalers Village outdoor shopping mall (Great shopping, by the way... just steps from the hotel). Room was nice; comfy bed and very nice furnishings. Breakfast was nice; buffet style out doors by the pool. We were told that we could use our free breakfast coupons at three different restaurants, so we chose to go to the Sheraton the second day. I was really disappointed in the food and service there, so we ate at the Westin's buffet the third day, as we did on the first. However, we were under the impression that the third restaurant was a ways a way from the Westin. Turns out that if you go into this other restaurant area (which looks like a doorway for the servers), it leads to a beautiful area with a waterfall and overlooks the beach. I was disappointed that we didn't know about this area sooner. I only went to check it out because I saw people walking through the doorway and wondered where they were going. Unfortunately the hotel didn't tell us about this area. It would have been nice as a change of scenery. The pools were great; very relaxing. The main pool has two areas; one with a mini slide for kids to use and the other area has a large twist slide that even adults can use (I tried it once and that was enough fun for me!). Lots of waterfalls that splash into the pool. Behind that area is another pool exclusively for adults. Absolute Heaven! There is a \"cave\"-like structure that you can swim under and inside you'll find a hot tub. Very romantic! Plus, as the main pools close at 9pm, the adult pools are open til 10pm. One word of warning; when we arrived, we were told that there was a welcome gift for us at the front desk. We went to get it and it turned out to be a bunch of coupons. The Westin has condo properties and the staff tried to rope us into scheduling a tour of their property in exchange for a $100 voucher. We almost fell for it, until I read the fine print. We had no intention of going to their tour, but the catch is that if you DON'T go on the tour, you will be BILLED for the $100. They never actually gave us the voucher, but it caused us a lot of worry because we were afraid we would be charged anyway. Just be aware and always read the fine print! I was really disappointed that they would do something like that and it lowered my opinion of the hotel somewhat. There's no real business center that I could find but the pool bar has free internet computers for use. The fitness center was excellent, with every kind of machine you can imagine. I wish we could have used it more. Plus, it's open 24 hours a day, which is really cool. Parking, as others have said, is TERRIBLE! Very small spots and people don't know how to park in the designated parking spots, so one night we came back and had to use valet parking, since our mid-size car wouldn't fit without smashing into someone's car. Unfortunately there is a fee for valet, so again we were afraid we would be charged for something we had no control over. I noticed that there seem to be MANY more valet spots than there were self-parking. Ridiculous parking situation for a hotel this big. Every night we had problems finding a space. All in all, a nice hotel, right on Kaanapali Beach.

First he tells me our reservation was cancelled since I did not 'confirm' the reservation in April (when I put my credit card down for a deposit I was never told I would need to and I had just stayed at the Moana, another Westin resort, the days prior and had no such issues) then he tells me that I should not have received the discount that I was getting, although I had a letter stating I would be using said discount. After informing him that I had no such issues at the Moana a few days earlier he relented and began to check us in which he did in such a harried manner you would think there were 20+ people in line behind us, it being almost 11pm there was no one, and a many minutes later we were unceremoniously presented with our keys and mumbled directions to our room. (We did walk by the check in desk another day and saw him helping another couple with the same rushed attitude, so maybe that's just how he was). Both my boyfriend and I discussed asking for his manager but decided that since we were getting such a great deal, and it being late at night we would let it go unless we had some other issues with him. Thankfully we did not and the rest of our stay was magnificent. We spent hours by the pool, which is great since there are 5 separate pools including an adults only pool so none of the pools ever felt really crowded, and at the beach, walking to Whalers Village and exploring the hotel and surrounding area. Our room was spacious and the 'free' wi-fi and daily water were a nice touch. (I say 'free' because they charge all guests a $25 daily fee for these things, no ifs, ands or buts).

We had come from Honolulu. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and had a view of a large tree and the parking lot. It was okay, everything else made up for it. There is a Costco as you come out of the airport at Kahului. We stopped there after we picked up our rental car. The place was packed. As we were staying at the Westin for 4 days, we did not want to eat breakfast out every day because we knew prices would be expensive, so we picked up a large fruit bowl and some muffins at Costco and some soda. The Westin has small frigerators for some food and drinks. Checkin was a breeze. After we checked in, we walked around the property before heading toward the swimming pool. They have a very nice sundry shop on property for snacks, sodas, buying t-shirts, macadamia nuts, etc. A lovely waterfall is right outside the lobby and has flamingos, swans (I think they were swans), and large koi. The swimming pool is terrific. They have a large waterslide for \"older\" children. They have waterfalls whereby the water from the fall empties into the pool. We did notice that the water was colder when you were near the waterfalls. The pools are interconnected, and there is one pool with a tunnel that my son just loved. If you take a walk you can go up the stairs up behind all the pools and see the most amazing views. There are small geckos running around on the stairs. There is a wedding gazebo up at the top. There is an adult only pool with a bar. My husband immediately wanted to start building tiki-style huts in our backyard when we returned home-haha!! We tended not to eat on property as it was too expensive. The breakfast buffett was over $27. We tended to eat off property. Whaler's Village is right next door. Down in the lower level of Whaler's Village is a food court where you can get McDonald's, chinese food, pizza, and ice cream. We ate there a few times in the evening. The food was reasonably priced. We also ate one evening at Lelani's on the Beach (it's also right next door), but again it's kind of pricey. CJ's Deli and Diner is about 1/2 mile away, and there are several restaurants in Lahaina. We ate at Cilantro's and Cheeseburger in Paradise. I will say the Westin Maui makes the best Pina Colada I've ever had--and at happy hour drinks are 1/2 price. There is also an ABC store at Whaler's Village for purchasing small items. There is a daily charge of $25 that is added to your room. With this fee, you get 2 bottles of water, access to the fitness center, internet service, and I can't think of what else--maybe parking? Oh, another thing I wanted to add is that their beds are amazing--I think it's called the heavenly bed--I really would love to purchase one for our home. You just sink into it. The beach is only a few minutes from your room. We found the waves to be a little rougher than the ones at Waikiki. There is also a nice walking path that goes along the resorts in West Maui. It is very nice to get up early in the morning and take a stroll. You can get some beautiful pictures. Also, you will be able to see the islands of Lanai and Molokai from West Maui.

The room had a safe that held our laptop computer which is very convenient. Coffee maker and refrigerator came in handy as well. Pool was excellent - we went to the adult pool almost every day - and there was always plenty of room. We had most of our meals by the pool since I was there on an employee rate and we would get a discount at the pool bar and Ono's. The food was very good and the servers were very polite. I asked my husband if he wanted to share a sandwich with me and when it came the server had it split up for us already - very nice! We ate at Ono's several times for lunch and breakfast. We did get the breakfast buffet only because I did get the food discount...$28 for a breakfast buffet in my opinion is way too much - the food was good but not worth $28! We also had dinner at the Hula Grill and Leilani's next door at Whalers Village which was also very good. We totally took advantage of the shuttle into Lahaina almost everyday. Moose McGuillicudy's, Lahaina Fish Co., Mala's, Bubba Gumps all had great food and service. My favorite is Mala's near the Lahaina Cannery Mall (a must)! I did get a massage at the cabana one day and they did have a 10% discount. Almost fell to sleep it was so great.

Had another great experience. People whine about the size of the rooms in the Ocean Tower. My thoughts? If your traveling as a couple you'll have plenty of space. If you are traveling as a family you're going to be crammed into any standard hotel room regardless of whether its 360 or 450 square feet. The Ocean Tower rooms have very classy furniture, nice big balconies (ALL views on the ocean side of the building are nice - even if you are on a lower floor and can't actually see the beach), and our room was very clean. We've also stayed in the Beach Tower and can tell you I'm fairly indifferent between the two. The people were friendly as ever, and the hotel (keeping in mind it's over 20 years old and parts are like 35 years old) looked great. The pool is the best in West Maui, and the slide is fun for all ages. You can't beat the beach location, again, the best in West Maui. We found the food expensive but very very yummy - especially the breakfast buffet. I'd ALMOST pay $28 for it at home every once in awhile... The resort fee is a bit of nuisance but you'll find it at all Hawaii resorts, and at least at the Westin it includes some items of real value, we used the water bottles everyday and the wireless internet (also included) was great. Considering Internet alone is costing $12-13 a day at mainland hotels, and parking is easily $10 at most places, $25 isn't that bad.

We have a home on Oahu so we travel to Hawaii a couple of times a year. We decided to visit Maui and I cashed in 60,000 Starwood points for 3 nights. My friend accompanied us and paid $350 a night for the same room, but with a view of the parking lot. We at least got a mountain view. As is typical for all Hawaii hotels, the lobby is gorgeous. The front desk personnel are pleasant. Then you get on the elevator. Somebody mentioned it was dirty but I think it was incredibly worn. It looked like a fleabag hotel elevator. I can't tell you how shocked we were. Then we get to the room. It was nice enough but I don't think I have ever stayed in such a small hotel room, except maybe London. Even New York City has larger hotel rooms. No closet, no place to put our one small suitcase. We had 2 double beds. I can't believe that Starwood would have a hotel property with double beds. My friend had a King bed so she had a bit more walking around room but not worth $350 a night. Of course you need to pay for internet, the \"resort\" fee, breakfast, etc. The restaurants were okay. You have to watch the birds though. They were helping themselves to the food on the breakfast buffet. There was a coffee bar/breakfast area that some people thought was complimentary. Nothing is ever complimentary at the \"high-end\" hotels but some people had to be told to pay and others just took what they wanted and walked away. It was so weird and unprofessional. The pool was a nightmare. There was an adults only pool which we couldn't use. The family pool was huge but too deep for our kids to stand up in. People reserved their chairs at like 6:00 in the morning but at 9:00, after we had been swimming for 2 hours they still had not made an appearance. It left people like us who actually were in the pool with no place to put our things but the grass. There were only 4 or 5 people in the pool the whole time we were there but the chairs were always empty with towels on them. They have this system where you get a towel but if you don't turn it back in you get charged $20. And supposedly they will pick up your towel if it sits on a chair for half an hour. They only went around putting warning notes on a couple of times in the two days we used the pool But we actually witnessed two fights where people thought their chairs had been stolen and some guy was getting dinged for the towel because the pool attendants collected them. He tried to take some other people's towel. It was really ugly. I've thought about what the hotel could do to have a more pleasant hotel experience. Maybe it is just the class of people this hotel attracts but \"reserving\" a chair while you are in your room for 4 hours is rude and I think the hotel needs to address this. If you are already paying $350 a night for a room you should try the Hyatt or stretch a bit for the Ritz-Carlton. A much classier hotel. If you are cashing in your Starwood points go to Thailand. For half the points you get 3 times the room for twice as long.

I read some of the negative reviews and decided to stay at the Westin anyway since I have never had a bad experience at a Westin property. My wife and I recently traveled to Maui and decided to stay at the Westin using a combination of points and cash. When we arrived at the hotel we were impressed with the beautiful lobby. We then checked into the hotel were told that we were be upgraded to a Mountain View room on the 10th floor. So far so good. We then got into the elevator which set the tone for the overall cleanliness of the hotel. The elevator looked as though it had not been wiped down since it was originally installed. As we walked down the hallway to our room we noticed a couple of dirty room service trays sitting on the ground. Throughout our stay we found this was a par for the course. We would see the same dirty trays and trash sit in the hallways for several hours. At one point I noted the time we first saw a couple of trays in the hallways, six hours later the trays were still sitting in the same place. In that time someone from room service had come through the hallway at least twice and never bothered to clean up. When the trays were finally picked up trash that was sitting on the side of one of the trays was left there. That trash sat in the same place for another day before it was picked up. The room itself was very small and had limited space to put our clothes (no real closet). The bed had the Heavenly pillow top mattress which helped but was not to the same standard as other Westins I have stayed at in the past. The pillow top mattress was not able to make up for the old box spring and mattress. The room had a balcony with a small table and two chairs. The view of the mountains was very nice. However, when you looked down you there was the self parking lot. The problem with the parking lot is that the noise from the horns honking was unbearable Every time someone locked their car doors their horn would honk. The only thing more annoying was those times when the lock button was mistaken for the panic button and we got to hear the car alarm go off. The worst part of the stay was the service provided by Service Express and the front desk. I stopped by the front desk to see if they had a room that was not directly on top of the parking lot and was told I could pay extra for an ocean view room. I then called later to talk with a manager and was told she would note my complaint in the system but she could not help me. This is not say that certain individuals did not go above and beyond to try and make the stay enjoyable. The staff in the restaurants and the valet parking attendants were always very friendly and helpful. The location was incredible. The pool was very nice. However, the poor service from the front desk and service express, the lack of cleanliness, and poorly maintained rooms make the Hyatt a better choice for the money. I have stayed at the Hyatt and Ritz-Carlton several times and how found the experience at these hotels to be much better. I paid $90 per night, plus $25 resort fee, and 4,600 Starwood points per night for this stay. Despite paying a little over $100 per night for hotel that charges $300 per night I feel like I was robbed. The experience I had at the Westin might have been bearable if it was free.

We were not greeted by anyone when we pulled up at 8 pm on a Friday night. We had to figure out how to get into the self parking, which was full and we finally found a valet to help us park our car but no one offered to help us with our bags. Check in was okay and the gentlemen behind the desk said we were upgraded to a full \"ocean view\" in the Ocean Tower. I should have right there requested a Beach Tower after reading the reviews, but figured it would be okay. The elevators are old and need to be cleaned or something - I understand that salt air/water will erode metal, but I think a Clorox Bleach wipe would have done a world of good. We were on the 5th floor so really couldn't see the ocean through the palm trees - so much for the \"ocean view\". Our room didn't have to two complimentary bottles of water when we got to our room, nor did we get them consistantly everyday.

I am a \"preferred\" Starwood member and got a message that the concierge had a welcome gift for me, but when I went down, she just said that she was happy to tell me I was getting Starwood points for my stay - what? That's not a gift, that's part of being in the Starwood program. The pool was crazy - it was crowded when we were there and the \"chair hogs\" were down at 7 am saving chairs that they wouldn't come sit on for hours later. Westin's policy is if a chair hasn't been occupied for over an hour, they'll move the stuff, but I never saw that happen. We chose to just stay on the beach, which was nice and not too crowded. The location is great - Whaler's Village is right next store - I would highly recommend swinging by the ABC store in Whaler's Village to stock up on snacks, lunch items and such vs. eating at the Westin. The breakfast buffet was below average for the price - had it not been included in our package, we would have passed on eating at the Westin all together.

What makes this hotel the best on Ka'anapali is its location and the quality of rooms and amenities. Having stayed in different parts of the hotel we'd recommend the Beach Tower which has larger rooms and is closer to the pools and beach front. All rooms have recently been renovated with new furnishings and feature the Heavenly Bed which is simply divine. The hotel has a great pool scene with several pools to choose from but the property does lack a kiddie pool for kids that cannot swim. You should also know that the hotel does charge a daily resort fee of $26 so be sure to account for this as you budget for your stay. The fee covers wireless internet access, two bottles of water (daily), newspaper, parking, and access to a great workout facility. Hotel food prices are expensive but is to be expected -- fortunately the food is very good and they have several healthy options. If your looking to save money I'd recommend utilizing the refrigerator in the room by buying breakfast items at the local grocery store (Safeway or ABC) instead of the $25 per person breakfast buffet. In addition, the hotel is located next to Whalers Village which has great restaurants and shopping including the Hawaii chain store \" ABC\" (equivalent to CVS) which has great prices for things like snacks and gifts. Lastly the hotel offers a great spa (complimentary for SPG Gold/Platinum members) that features a quite room with great views of the ocean and complimentary water and snacks.

We stayed at the Westin Maui with friends from Oct 17th-Oct 22nd. I was looking forward to the traditional Lai upon arrival, sadly we didn't receive so much as a hello much less a lai. Because this was a dream vacation I blew it off because of it being so late at night when we checked in. I am a gold Starwood member and booked a fantastic rate on their website. At the reception desk there is a Starwood Preferred Line, however no one was there so we waited in the normal line. The young guy that checked us in, was horrible. I had to ask him for the upgrade, if that is what you want to call it. ( I will get to that later) While in the process of getting our keys, our friends arrived with Lai;s around their necks. They are also Starwood Gold members. I asked where they got the Lei's, they answered at the entrance to the hotel. Someone magically appeared at the Starwood desk and checked them in with a fabulous upgrade and full explanation of benefits they could enjoy as Starwood Members at the hotel. We went to our designated rooms. The room is large and comfortable, very clean. Big bathroom, lots of room to spread out for the week. I went to the balcony to see what are upgraded view looked like. To my surprise we were upgraded to a view of either the trash containers or the top of lobby roof. If we walked out on the roof far enough we could see the pool. (Stay away from the 2nd floor, it is labeled as a Starwood member floor) This was totally unacceptable, I left a message for the hotel manager and requested a phone call the next day. The manager called the next day and offered me an oceanfront premium room with her apology, Our friends were on the 8th floor, so we accepted an Oceanview premium instead to be closer to them. We ate breakfast at the buffet one morning. Beautiful presentation and so many food choices. Excellent buffet, but not worth it to us at 25.00 per head per day. Westin offers rates that include breakfast, but we did not select one. Our room came with a frig, which we filled up with groceries from the local market. Food is very expensive in Hawaii, be it at a restaurant or at the market. This worked well for us, as we spent a lot of our time at the pool or at the beach, so we would run up to the room for sandwich or snack. There is a mall next door and a food court. (IE: McDonalds) There are lots of great restaurants to pick from as we did each night for dinner. Pool: Huge Pool area, Kids Pool and an adult only Pool. Waterslide. Great fun for everyone. The water is cold. Didn't make sense since the temp was high. Every morning the staff fills the pool with freezeing cold water, so be prepared. The spa is wonderful but pricey, so bring extra monies. Staff is wonderful. Several evenings we would arrive back late after going out for dinner. If the self parking is full they will Valet for free. We enjoyed that several evenings. Overall the Westin Maui is wonderful and I still rank it overall as VG.

The public areas are beautiful and impressive, with a design intended to take advantage of vistas of the impressive swimming pools, swan ponds, rock formations, and man-made waterfalls, as well as being wide open to the tropical breezes of Maui. The Hyatt Regency Maui is probably three times as impressive and beautiful, but also more expensive than the Westin. For a family of 2 adults and 2 teens, 5 nights at the Westin was more than sufficient, as the room itself is small. If we were to stay here again, then we would try to book two connecting rooms instead. We were in the Ocean Tower (the larger of the 2 tower options available) and while the room itself was furnished fairly comfortably (great bed, flat screen TV, built in armoire), we would not consider it resort luxury. For that, stay at the Grand Wailea instead but be prepared to pay the price for luxury too. The bathroom had a small sink area outside of the bathroom (which was simply functional but nothing luxurious). There was a convenient empty refrigerator and a safe under a cabinet in the sink area itself. Overall, while the public areas are gorgeous and well kept, the hotel rooms are just too small to really enjoy and relax in (if that is what you intend to do \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which our family likes to do after a busy day of sightseeing/swimming). Overall, the Ocean Tower is a bit tired and outdated for 21st century resort expectations and should probably be imploded and constructed brand new. But the location is excellent, the public areas are beautiful and impressive, and the swimming pools and beach convenience were great. The resort fee we were charged everyday gave us parking in the very narrow parking spaces of the self parking lot. Plus you got Internet access, fitness room access and 2 bottles of water daily. On weekends, the self parking lot will likely be full and spaces hard to come by. The resort fee is a joke and should be eliminated since you really aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to accept or decline it anyway. When the Westin was upgraded in the late 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the hotel constructed five swimming pools, complete with waterfalls and a cave Jacuzzi. And of course the hotel fronts Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach itself. The beach has great wave action \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not too mild and not too strong. But it can become deep after only a few feet into the ocean, so little ones must be watched carefully. Not great for any snorkeling, so we walked about 15 minutes towards Black Rock and found some nice areas to snorkel from the beach. Plus there were some tourist teens diving from the Black Rock cliff into the ocean. We played in the four family friendly pools nearly every day of our stay, but these close at sunset. As others have noted, the pool water is initially cold and while your body will eventually get used to it, I wished they had turned up the thermostat on the pools. The adult pool and spa (the fifth of the five pools) is open until 10:30 PM, but not for children. We had no problems finding loungers at any of the pools or at the beach. The work out fitness room overlooked the pool and casual restaurant through floor to ceiling windows. Although the modern design was very cool and impressive, there were only a handful of work out machines (but plenty of cardio options). The upside was that the fitness room was open 24/7. We took advantage of the breakfast buffet offered in the casual restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Colonnade Cafe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd overlooking the swimming pool area. Great selection of fresh fruit, eggs cooked to order, pastries, cereals, Japanese breakfast options, and plenty of meats and other cholesterol choices. But if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a short walk to the buffet stations, then ask to be seated in the adjoining \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tropica\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant for a smack-on ocean view from your table. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize this until after our second breakfast there. Dinner choices abound in Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali and we had one dinner in the Colonnade Caf\u00c3\u00a9, which was seldom busy. The Westin is adjacent to the Whalers Village shopping plaza where the Hula Grill and Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were always packed with tourists and the menus were expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but great locations on the beach, so if that is your thing then go for it as many people seemed to eat at both places. There are some inexpensive options such as the nearby CJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (in the Fairway Shops section of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali \u00e2\u20ac\u201c serving breakfast, lunch and dinner at very local prices) and the Aloha Mixed Plate restaurant in nearby Lahaina. We unexpectedly came across LuLu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the Lahaina Cannery Mall and got a 50% discount off everything on their menu (if you ordered between 5 and 6 PM). Excellent deal. One can also pick up breakfast at McDonalds in the Whalers Village food court. Would we stay at the Westin Maui again? As a family, only if we could book 2 adjoining rooms at a deeply discounted rate. For a couple, the standard room is fine. Loved Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali because you are totally wrapped up in the beauty of the island, but would consider trying some of the other hotels and timeshare resorts available there.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNever Been so relaxed\u201d", "Author": "dsecord", "ReviewID": "UR27030588", "Content": "When we first got there, they told us our room was next to the elevator and we would be switched (if we so choose) the next night to a better room.

We saw more Whales on our snorkeling trip then our Whale excursion. Every time we went under water while snorkeling, we could hear the Whales! Black rock is right down the beach, and one of the best places to snorkel. If you want some waves, go to DT Flemming beach (North about 5 - 10 miles). Another good snorkeling place is Ahihi bay, which has an underwater preserve. That is located near Grand Wailea (South of resort). The Westin has a great staff that can tell you where all the locations are, plus set up trips for you. That makes life even more relaxing, you just show up.

I was traveling with a group of 14 people for my sister's wedding. I had my husband and three year old son with me . I would like to address some of the issues previous reviewers had stated. Let me just start by saying what an incredible deal we got on our room...$200 dollars per night through Orbitz. We stayed in room 1120 in the beach tower....the older tower. The arrival at the hotel was breathtaking when you see the beautiful lobby with all of the fish and birds. It makes you feel like you are in a tropical paradise. My son instantly wanted to feed the fish. Our check-in was smooth and then we went to our room. Our room was next to the elevator and overlooked the parking lot but was on the highest floor (11th) so we mostly saw the mountains and golf course. The room was just big enough for the three of us and turned out to be a very quite room. I never heard the room next door or the elevator...or anything else really. The beds were so comfortable and I am going to buy one of those heavenly shower heads. The room was also very clean and the cleaning lady was always ready to clean by 9:00a.m.. The lobby was a great meeting place for our group in the morning and to keep our son entertained. It was also a wonderful place to relax in the shade. The pool area always had a seat and the waitresses were extremely nice. There was never a problem getting towels either. The pool was clean but a bit cold. My son would not get into it until the third day because of the temperature. The pool temperature is fine once you get used to it . The drinks are pricey but there is usually a happy hour going on at one of the bars. I did not care muchfor the breakfast downstairs. My son always ate free because he was under five which made it convenient. We racked up about a $650 room bill upon check out. Some of that was the $25 resort fee and there was a lot of tropical monkeys from the bar. They are $10 dollars a piece but my husband became addicted to them. The parking spaces were small but there always was one available. Every staff member we encountered was nice and I definitely did not get the impression that the hotel had a \"Disney\" like feel to it. It was just a relaxing and pleasant resort that gave my family a lot of wonderful memories.

We were trying to decide between the Westin and the Hyatt (never got to see the Hyatt so not sure which one was nicer). The weather wasn't great but better than once we got to Kauai. It was very windy but most of our days we had sunshine and it was in the high 70s so even with the wind we got to spend some time at the pool. A bit too windy for the beach. We liked the lobby when you arrive as they have a lagoon with pretty waterfalls and flamingos. We were greeted with a shell lei. The package we chose on Orbitz gave us an upgrade to a mountain view. It was actually a very pretty view and we were up high enough from the parking lot where we didn't hear much noise. There is also a $25/day resort fee which covers self parking (fills up at night but they valet your car for free if it is full), 2 bottles of water per day and silly things that have always normally been included in your rate like a safe and the fitness center. The water came in handy as you have a little frig. The rooms are small and tight but fine. The beds were comfy. The shower itself seems a little dingy. I definitely didn't feel like I was staying in a room that costs $450/night. Luckily we had 2 nights for free with our orbitz package. The hallway, elevators and rooms didn't seem like they just had a renovation. Not sure what they renovated...The grounds were a different story. 5 pools including an adult only pool. 2 water slides, one for the kiddos and one for the adults. When you request pool towels and they put a wristband on you (a different color each day) - tacky! No ones checks your wristband except if you want to go down the water slide. If you want to use a chair on the beach, which I think should be included providing you are paying $25/day resort fee. That feels like nickeling and dimeing. Speaking of, they offered pilates and yoga but charged you I think $12/class which again with the resort fee thought something like this should be included. The grounds are very lush and tropical and fun pools. They have a couple waterfalls and cold \"hot\" tub in one of the caves. It's a little warmer than the pool but not a hot tub. They have a separate hot tub as well by the adult pool. We got breakfast included with our orbitz package and glad we did as the breakfast buffet is about $27/person. It's very good, with custom omelettes, scrambled eggs, french toast or pancakes, bacon, fruit, bagels and pastries. Includes coffee, tea and juice. I gained about 5 lbs from this vacation probably from these huge breakfasts! You could eat here at the Westin resort & spa the other Westin ocean resort villas, or sheraton. We only ate here and at the Sheraton of which the breakfast was great there too. To compare the Sheraton, the grounds were nice there too but not as nice as the westin. What the Sheraton has over the westin is the beach is much better. You can walk there from the Westin (10 minute or so walk) and snorkel although my husband is an avid scuba diver and said the snorkeling was not good at all there. He almost rented a tank, he was glad he checked it out snorkeling first. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants other than our included breakfast. Which you can sit at either of the restaurants including Tropica and have a nice ocean view while enjoying the same buffet. Most people don't know this, just go around to the ocean side where tropica is and get seated there. You won't have to wait in line either. While in Maui we did the Road to Hana, continued on after the road to Hana and went up the volcano in one day. It was an exhausting day. I would advise to break it up. A lot of the waterfalls were not that spectacular which I was surprised since it was winter time and their rainy season. We had the Maui Revealed book (which is a great book by the way) and tried to follow the stops on it. We missed many and one of the first water falls it tells you to stop at we didn't get to see since we did not feel like walking over dead animal carcasses that were probably most likely left there by the locals to keep tourists away from spots. Also you don't need a 4-wheel drive. We had a compact car and did just fine. Bring your bonine if you are prone to car sickness. Between all the curves and then the dirt road (after the road to Hana if you continue on) is very bumpy. Speaking of we rented a car from priceline and got a great deal of $12/day. People who hadn't rented cars couldn't even get one since they ran out. With the economy they have shipped out many of their cars to the mainland so better to have one secured before you leave. For the road to hana trip, we bought a styrofoam cooler and got some sandwiches at the Foodland Deli before we left our hotel area. It was nice to have a little picnic at Waianapanapa State Park. This is something to see. Once you get to Hana, you can either turn around and go back the same way you can or you can continue on. This is where we thought it was really beautiful sights of the coast but parts of the road are not paved and it is very narrow where only one car can fit through at a time but most cars are all driving from Hana. We felt it was well worth the continued drive. We then drove up the dormant volcano Haleakala which is 10,000 feet up. Boy you are high up there!! We actually drove above the clouds. It's very curvy of course driving up a volcano but it's nicely paved and plenty of room for 2 cars to get by. I'm sure on a clear day it would be quite an amazing sight. Bring a jacket it's a bit chilly. I have to say one of the best things we did was go to the magic show of Warren and Annabelle. It is an amazing show!!! And not cheesy or tacky either. We still can't figure out how Warren did the things he did. My husband and I were one of the chosen couples to help. There's no sawing a woman in half or anything like that. And it was quite neat to part of the show and not figure out how he did things when we were up so close. Not to be missed! Make sure you get your tickets ahead of time as they sell out. We went to the earlier show 5pm and it doesn't end until 9p. If you are not eating, you can show up a bit later. About an hour later and you can still get a drink or a dessert. For restaurants we went to Leilani's on the Beach, next to the Westin. We just ate downstairs which is a bit cheaper and more casual. It was good. Make sure you get the Hula Pie! It is to die for but you'll need to share. It's an oreo cookie crust with macadamia nut ice cream, hot fudge, whip cream. YUMMY! There's a chain of restaurants you can get this at. Like the Hula Grill too, same type of place next to Leilani's. Kimo's in Lahaina (just 10 minute drive south) is part of this chain. They have a lot of fish specials and they were very good. On the water as well. It was very good. I had ahi whenever I could which was often :) BJs restaurant has chicago pizza and it was very good. A bit of a cheaper dinner. The large pizza is huge and too much for the 2 of us. Across the street but up and has a view of the water but not the sunset as there is a big tree in the way at least in February there was. We also ate Pacific'o (a late lunch) and it's right on the beach. Again it was good. Got a mojito and it was VERY strong, too strong for me. Lastly we took a ride down to the Wailea area. Ate at Nick's Fishmarket at the Fairmont. VERY expensive. Entrees were mostly $40-50 if you wanted a salad it was another $14-18. It was good but not that good. The service is what they are known for but they are all on top of you when they seat you. You got one person getting your chair while another is putting the napkin on your lap and another is pouring water. And then they watch you. A bit uncomfortable. I like my service somewhere in between, not wondering where my wait person is but attentive. Fairmont grounds are nice but they aren't as lush and tropical. It's a little more \"higher class' but we were looking for a fun pool and more tropical. It had a nice beach area but you couldn't walk as the other resorts and them blocked it off so it is private. I guess good that it's private but we like to walk the beaches. Also visited the grounds at the Four Seasons! And that is luxury! It's not super tropical nor does it have fun pools but it's NICE! I had booked a oceanside massage there. Which was pretty heavenly except for the weed whacking going on next door at another property. Plus construction. They made up for it by comping me since we had driven an hour down there which I thought was very nice of them. My husband golfed at the Makena Golf course down in wailea. It was very impressive and he was the only one on the course so he golfed by himself. He had planned to golf at Prince in Kauai (supposed to be the best in Kauai and some say the he best in Hawai) but we both went in the ocean and got knocked around pretty good by the waves. He landed on his shoulder and it never healed enough to play Prince :( Overall we had a great stay! Maui was our favorite island out of the 3 we visited - Oahu, kauai and Maui.

The hotel itself is very very nice, and a lot of effort does appear to go in to keeping it that way.

It is worth bearing in mind that this is a very large hotel. We mistakenly thought it would be relativley quiet given the economic crisis and sort of out of season time. We we're very wrong. Hotel was full, people everywhere!!! A place by the pool?? NO CHANCE. Due to the high winds we had being on the beach was not much of an option either, sandblasted. The beach at the Westin is nice. A lot of people say its spectacular but I would say its far from that. If your expecting blue waters and the same beaches as you would find in say the Bahamas or Grand Cayman.... forget it. Food at the hotel is very pricey. Cost of the breakfast buffet is daylight robbery. 2 X Buffet and an ONE orange juice each $65. We had a room bill at the end of the week of over a thousand dollars. One other point, the Westin charges this daily resort fee. $25. It covers things like parking, gym, internet and some other stuff that really is worthless. The daily resort fee does irritate me at hotels as its simply another revenue earner for them. And for people which only come to relax and dont use whats included are penalized. Upon check-out, I complained I was not happy about the charge as we had used absolutly nothing that was included and the duty manager cancelled five days of charges so that was a result and good service from the Westin. Overall it is unlikely we will return to Maui at all. Far nicer places to go for the same or less cost and much much better beaches elswhere also.", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bozeman, Montana", "Title": "\u201cOrdinary\u201d", "Author": "qaz123", "ReviewID": "UR25758191", "Content": "This property is, simply put, ordinary. Nothing really distinguishes it from the other mega-resorts lining Kaanapali Beach. The rooms a decently sized, though there is no design feature that makes them stand out in any way. If you didn't look out of your window, you could be in Des Moines. The room felt relatively clean, but certainly not spotless. The pool area is sprawling, but even given its apparent size and the fact that Hawaii is allegedly suffering from a significant downturn in tourism, it could be hard to find open loungers if you didn't arrive early. Part of this must be due to the fact that there are no loungers on the beach, unless, of course, you want to pay extra money. As other reviewers have written, the pool is cold. In fact, we swam in the ocean rather than take a dip in the pool. The beach is nice, though it is a little narrow in the area in front of the Westin. Down by Black Rock and the Sheraton, the beach is much wider and the water calmer. As an aside, the Sheraton was more spread out and imparted a feeling of spaciousness as compared to the Westin, which tries to fit a lot of stuff into a smaller space. The service was fine, nothing special and nothing outrageously bad either. Housekeeping was prompt, which is commendable given the size of this resort, and the front desk was competent enough. The valets handed their job with aplomb. As for parking, the self-parking section of the lot filled up every evening before we returned from dinner, so we received \"complimentary\" valet (you still have to tip and you are paying a $25 resort fee). The gym was the cleanest and, in my opinion, the nicest part of the hotel. Spacious, immaculate and stocked with new cardio and weight equipment, it had much to recommend it. Overall, this property is fine--we used cash and points so I can't complain about value--but there is absolutely no way I would ever pay full price here.

Also, if you want to do a whale watch trip, they leave right from there, so it's very convenient.

There was enough storage space. The non-ocean views from the upper floors were very nice - of the mountains and the other hotels. I wish the lanais had been bigger, they were very tiny. The room had a nice flat screen TV. Heavenly beds were very comfy. I had also hoped for a nicer bathroom; it was quite low-ceilinged and tiny with no ventilation fan. It was great to have a refrigerator. Our room service and other room requests came promptly, no long waits though it is a very large hotel. We also had a convention there for part of our stay; they mobbed the buffet breakfast but were otherwise not bothersome. I wished that the hot tub was not up on the upper, adult-only level. We like to go in as a family, and i noticed that down the way at the Hyatt there were no such restrictions. Others may prefer a no-kid hot tub. The kids club was very nice (Much nicer than the Hyatt's) My 9 yr old son went there one morning and would have liked to go back. Others said the pool was freezing and i agree. We moved to the Westin from another property where the pool was quite warm, and really found it difficult to tolerate. Our stay was in February, so it wasn't super hot, and a warmer pool would have been more pleasant. I had thought that my son would be on the slide all day, but I think the water was too cold for him to enjoy it. It is very easy to sit on your beach chair at the Westin and do nothing all day.

Some days it is just above average-but we definitely walked the 1/2 mile down the beach everyday to plant ourselves in front of the Sheraton for snorkeling. Watching the cliff divers here was fun too. They also had some good live music from their pool. We dined in Lahina-we know some locals and went directly to their recommended restaurants. I would return to Mala (overlooking the pier). If you visit Wailea shops be sure to eat at Tommy Bahamas cafe-good food, reasonable price, and good service.

The beach at Kaanapali is the bomb!, we decided to try a different hotel. This was hard because we fell in love with the Hyatt located just down the beach. The Westin Maui Resort is so similiar to the Hyatt it is hard to say which one is the best, they are so similiar. If you are deciding which one to go to I would have to say, if you have younger kids, 5 years to 7, the Hyatt is better just because they have a small kids beach/pool and slide which allows less worry. The Westin and Hyatts pools are really similiar, but I think the Hyatt has more tropical feel, but the Westin has more room around the pool area and has a better & bigger beach area. The drinks at the Westin aren't what they should be, lack size and flavor, but are still worth the money. Pina Coladas at the Hyatt are better! The breakfast buffet at the Westin is excellent and the hotel is really close to Whalers village which is great at night, you can just stroll over to one of the restaurants next door for dinner. The staff at this hotel are really nice and offer great service. The grounds are awesome here! If you are looking for a Laua,look no further, the Luau here at the Westin is one of the best. The fire show at the end is AWESOME!!! I recommend the surf school located near the Marriot down the beach. They were excellent with my older 11 year old son, I felt he was safe at all times and within walking distance from the hotel. The instructors are local Maui surfers and nice as could be. Again if you are looking for a local place to get some good breakfast, cheaper from the hotel, go to Java Jazz. Just a short drive north of the hotel located in a little shopping center. Awesome music while you have breakfast, enjoy their excellent specialty coffees or a bloody mary. If you get the pancakes, BEWARE!!, they are huge. Share! My last review of the Hyatt, I think I might have mentioned that we did not get a lei greeting or even a Aloha when we arrived, well, not the case at the Westin. We arrived and right away received a lei for a women, and the boys and I received one for guys. The greeter even told us the story behind lei's and gave us a Aloha to the island and resort.

Our room was never cleaned till around 4PM each day and it seemed that it was an afterthought because it was never dusted, never vaccumed and the tub seemed dirty. As for the 25$ resort service charge, we were supposed to get 2 bottles of water in our room each day. Well on 4 occasions we were not given any and I had to call and have housekeeping bring it up. When they did the guy stood there and expected a tip for what I have already paid for. As for soap they would not replenish it on a frequent basis, at times were were left with a small piece that we needed to use at the sink and then in our shower.

The pool area is great but the Adult pool area is small and fills up quite fast each morning with people reserving chairs which we were told that they were not allowed to do so but no one enforced this policy. We asked the conceirge about the Sheraton's dining menu and they do not have them which I find extremely odd as they are sister hotels. They will have menu's of several other places but not their own??? We asked about the Prime Rib dinner that they were offering and they told us that we should go and no reservations are needed and that they have free valet service for hotel quests that ate at the restaurant otherwise it will be $5..

In 2004 I had an oceanfront room at the Hyatt Regency and this time I had a mountain view room at the Westin. I must admit that on both trips I spent little time in my room - probably less than eight hours a day. There's just too much to do on the island to spend in the room. The Hyatt room was certainly bigger than the Westin and offered more room for luggage storage. Bath size was comparable but in different configuration with the Hyatt having a combo shower/toilet in one small room with the vanity/sink in another. The Westin had the traditional all-in-one. The Westin won points for its empty mini-fridge with complimentary bottled water, in-room safe, and double-headed shower. The bed was very comfortable and room nicely furnished. I did miss being able to leave sliding doors open so that I could listen to the ocean waves as I had at the Hyatt. The two things that won me over to the Westin were its location and its pool area. First, the Westin in right in the middle of Kaanapali Beach with the Hyatt on one end and the Sheraton/Black Rock on the other. Since I had activities on each end (parasailing and snorkeling) this was a central location. Then Whaler's Village adjoins the Westin and is so convenient for shopping and dining. On days by the pool and beach, I'd run over to Mickey D's or Nikki's (great Hawaiian pizza) in the Whaler Food Court and return to eat it poolside, certainly saving a few bucks over the more expensive hotel options. The Hula.Grill and Leilani\"s By the Beach are great places to eat as the sun goes down and the ABC store is great for snacks and supplies without having to go to Lahaina. The Westin pool area was preferable to me as it has a separate adult pool area on a different and quieiter level than the general pool with kids. I had no problem finding a lounge chair to relax here. Since I was with a large group I had no issues with the front desk checking in or out. I did ask the concierge about processing film and she referred me to the Ritz Camera in Whaler's Village and Long's Drug in Lahaina. The Ritz Camera shop is no longer an option as it is now occupied by a T-shirt shop. No issues with housekeeping and kudos to the bar staff for great service on several occasions. Fortunately on both of my trips the hotels have not been overcrowded with tourists and the aloha spirit has prevailed. Both the Hyatt and Westin have equally attractive lobbies and common areas.

Upon check-in, the red-head gentleman at the front desk told me that we requested a room away from the elevator, but the room we were assigned to was exactly next to the elevator. He also told me that we would need to wait 45min - 1 hour if we want a room as requested. So...we waited for our room. Check-in time is written at 3 PM. We checked into the room at 5:15 PM. The same guy who checked us in also tried to tell us that our rate was alot higher that what we reserved the room for. We had to pull out the laptop on the spot and slapped the reservation page in his face before he agreed to change the rate to what our reservation records said. I find this to be the most disgusting tactic to rip off people who are there for a relaxing time. It is a know fact that Maui tourism dropped severely all of last year, and this must be the time for the hotel to reclaim their lost businesses. The hotel staff repeatedly said that Christmas break was a blessing for them as business filled up like the good old day, all the sudden. However, what the front desk tried to do was totally unprofessional. A few days into the vacation, we decided to order take-out lunch from O'no restaurant. The day before I ordered the take-out myself and it was fine, but the next day when my wife went to order the food, the host who took the ordered decided to charge my wife a 10 percent service fee. When asked why, the guy just simply shrugged his shoulder and said that they always do that. Another the dishonest act! Since our flight did not leave until midnight of the last day, we asked for late check out. They told us it would be $200 extra. We agreed to that, but at check out, the front desk person tried to charge us for an extra $25 resort fee for the late check-out portion in addition to the $25 resort fee we had already paid for that day!!! What the ? Watch out for your bill at the restaurant. They indicate that a child under 5 eats free with 1 paying adult. However 10 times out of 10 they would conveniently forget to deduct the child meal from the check!!! Too consistent to be called \"mistakes\". None of the jacuzzi had hot water. Enough is enough. I think the general manager of this hotel should rethink his/her customer service standard and ethics. All of the staff should be retrained or replaced if this hotel is to continue to try to deliver the customer service product that Westin pride itself upon.

The room was small but they did upgrade, at no charge, to a bigger ocean view. There were no suites available as we had virtually no planning in the trip. It was the best decision ever.

Here are the good and bad in my opinion. Location is excellent. Probably the nicest stretch of Ka'anapali Beach. Some would say the Sheraton which is at one end of the Boardwalk but the Westin in in the middle. It's also directly next to the Whalers Village Shopping area so its convenient to walk around. The Boardwalk that runs along Ka'anapali beach connects all the hotel resorts so its a beautiful walk to do. My room was very nice. It was in the Beach Tower Rm 583 and was newly redone with a flat screen tv and nice bed and balcony. Maid service was ok not great. Cleaned daily but they didn't always provide lotion which is important to me after being in the sun all day. Mini fridges in the room makes it nice because you can grab a burger at the McD's in Whalers Village or food at the Safeway down the street and not pay hotel restaurant prices. The pools are very nice albeit crowded at times. The first week that I was there (mid dec) the hotel was empty and the pools/beach were perfect. The Xmas week the families and kids arrived and it was impossible to get a seat at the pool. That's not the Westins fault but warrants mentioning. Also, Leilani's Restaurant next door was being renovated (its open tho) and noise from the construction was directly under my balcony. Again, not the Westins fault. Golf courses are nice Kai and Royal albeit expensive. There are better courses to play on Maui for the money. Go to Wailea/Makena. The $25/day mandatory resort fee is a bit much to swallow. It gets you unlimited internet, use of the gym, two bottles of water daily, and free parking at the resort. I don't have a problem with them charging this, but I would just factor it into the room price beforehand. Ends up being cheesy at checkout to get another bill. Also, because I reserved this vacation package thru USAirways, I didn't get Starwood Points for this stay. Again, seems cheesy but this is why its not a 5 star place. Service. I also didn't get a lei greeting upon arrival or even see one. With all this said, its a typical Westin. Nice place. Efficient. Friendly. Clean. But it's not the Four Seasons or The Ritz. Service isn't up to that standard but then again, you aren't paying it either. As long as you realize this, it's a nice place, in a great location. Would I return, yeah probably for the right price.

When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a front desk employee who was anything but friendly. After informing us that there were no king rooms available with the full ocean view that we had booked we decided to take a room with two double beds rather than skimp on the view. The room was very small with the two beds in it and seemed like it hadn't been used in a while as everything was covered in dust. There was no complimentary champagne that we had heard so much about and the room wasn't even ready for guests i.e. no shampoo and soap, dirty, etc. The bathroom was small and could have been cleaner. Throughout our stay houskeeping left much to be desired. The bed always seemed rumpled and thrown together and the bathroom never seemed quite clean. The view from our lanai, however, was beautiful and we spent many evenings enjoying a drink there. Although the grounds and waterfalls were beautiful, we found them to be a bit noisy - completely drowning out the sound of the ocean. The pool areas were nice and always kept up. However, as mentioned in an earlier post, the hot tub was always full of kids and when we did finally venture in it, it was scalding hot. As with all resorts, the bars and restaurants were very pricey but we ventured down to Front Street for dinner most of the time. The food court at Whalers Village made for a cheaper alternative for breakfast and lunch. When inquiring about a late check out we were informed that the latest we could stay without a charge was 2:00 p.m. and after that the charge would be $200. We took advantage of the additional couple of hours and checked out at 2. We found the public areas of the hotel (the lobby, pools, etc.) to be very nice, but the room definitely left something to be desired for a four star resort. Also, we didn't find the employees to be very accomodating even though for the entire week we were in Maui all we kept hearing about was how slow things were there which would make me think that customer service would be at a high.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "christineb2000", "ReviewID": "UR22768340", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel with wonderful amenities and pools.

We like to party a little but enjoy the relaxing part of life too. We went to Waikiki at the end of march of 08 and wanted to try somewhere different so we picked Maui. In march we stayed in a condo so this time we wanted to stay at a resort and WOW was this one nice. We arrived around noon and of course our room was not ready but they upgraded us to a full ocean view. We went to the casual restaurant/bar for lunch and realized that all resort amenites are over priced. We are not cheap people and i like to enjoy and shop and spend money like anyone else. I just have a hard time being over charged for anything . I understand the resort has to make money and they have a lot of things to pay for but 24 dollars for 2 double drinks is crazy !!!! Anyhow we have lunch and a few drinks and then go check into our room. Very nice and a great view. The room is not very big but good enough, you are not there that much but one thing i need is a good size bathroom and that it was not, way to small but still nice and clean. Very small fridge if you want to keep a few snacks to avoid being overcharged in the resort. So that same day we go back downstairs for a few more drinks and then decide to have a little nap and then go to dinner. Well needles to say after a few drinks and no sleep the night before because of the flight we we out cold . 1:30 am we wake up, slept over the alarm so we decide to get some room service, we were starving. The late night menu was very limited but oh well we are hungry and try to order. We then find out they have only one type of sandwich left that neither me or my husband like . There is nobody in the kitchen to make anything and we find out all the sandwiches are all pre made. We go back to sleep hungry and really upset. The next morning we go to the front desk to talk to the manager and they were very nice and gave us a free breakfast buffet, which is 30 dollars a person so that was nice of them. We then decide to go to Safeway to pick up a few things and find the cab ride 2 miles down the rode was over 30 dollars there and back so needless to say we go and rent a car for the week. You really need a car in maui to go anywhere. There is the little whalers village right beside the hotel and a few places to eat but you can not eat there the whole time. So now we are set , got the car and got some snacks up in the room. The resort is very nice and clean, the lobby is very beautiful and the pools are very nice. They have an adult only pool so that's were we hung out. The tropica restaurant was ok, didn't find lots on the menu and again over priced. All of maui is very priced. We travel a fair bit , go away twice a year and now that we have been to Hawaii twice i don't think we will go back for awhile. It is so pretty there but we way over spent. You can't go running up to your room all the time to eat and drink. I love eating out and sitting at the bar for a few drinks but man i don't like paying threw the nose for it. We work hard and do have to save for our holidays and we will be paying this one off for awhile. Front st. is not very far , 5 min drive and there is lots of pubs/ restaurants and little souvenir shops. We hung out there alot. We went to the laHina grill for a fab dinner. We went to a few malls as well, shopping is not very good in maui, either channel or real cheap stuff. We also did the road to hana. Its crazy curvy and if you get car sick easy don't go . It was a very pretty dive but you don't need to go all the way . We went about 3/4 of the way and that was enough. Leave early if you want to go , you don't want to drive that road at night. The botanical gardens are really nice and they have really beautiful parrots there too that you can get your picture with. We also went to mamas fish house, everyone says to go . Its was ok but i have never paid 16 dollars for a martini and 55 dollars for an entre!!!! Not worth it. Maui is a very quiet island, there really isn't much to do there at night unless you want to go driving all over and for us at night we like to have a few drinks and you obviously can't drink and drive. I wanted to maybe go dancing on a few nights but that's not going to happen. We were there for halloween and down on front st. is where everyone goes. Do take a cab that night. It was fun , so many people and lots of cool costumes. Black rock is a 5 min walk down the beach and you can snorkel there, we did and saw a few fish so that was cool. The beach at the hotel is very nice but be careful of the waves, they are strong and i got slammed once, hubby had to pull me up....lol We also had a couple message and that was very nice as well. good spa.

We travel extensively and our preference is between top end 'boutique' hotel/resorts and ones that our four year old enjoy as well as ourselves. We had our 4 year old with us this time and I couldn't rate it better for children. Note: The kids club only takes children from 5 upwards. Having said that, it also looked great for people travelling without children as there were two 'adult only' pools with cocktail bar and restaurants (both on the property and very close by) that people were having 'intimate' meals at. Pool/water area was without doubt the 'piece de la resistance'. Lagoon style that wound throught the property with lots of different pools - massive water slide that kept all happy (ourselves included!) water volleyball pool, quieter 'relaxing pool' and for the smaller ones a little water slide into a pool more suited for young children where they floated around with their blowup rings (bought from the poolside store) flying down their little slide and going under the little waterfall. Poolside service and food was great, the restaurants were good (the best hotel one we thought was the one on the beach) - breakfast has the best selection we have come across (though the positioning of the birdhouse in the middle of the breakfast restaurant was not a good idea as the birds are thieves!...). Good Spa and the gym is fine with all the usual machines - busy at times - avoid the 6.30 am start. Across the road is Golf and Tennis (too hot for us to do both but prob great in cooler season). The hotel is located on a white sand beach - you walk from the larger 'kids' pool onto the boardwalk of the beach where the hotel has loungers if you are more a beach type. It is approximately in the middle of the beach with 'Whalers Village' literally next door which has restaurants, cafes, grocery store and shops (including Louis Vuitton...). If you walk along the pretty boardwalk to the left and right there are other hotels with lots of easily accessible restaurants/cafes too. End of the beach on the right is the 'black rock' beach in front of the Sheraton which has nice snorkling (not SCUBA diving quality but great to see little fish). Note: the hotel snorkel rental was approx $15 for the day - if you're planning on snorkling a lot recommend you go to Snorkel Bob or one of the rentals in Lahaina as they are more like $15/20 for the week. Room at the Westin was lovely (bed and linen was great) with beautiful views onto the ocean - and we booked the cheaper type - I suspect we were lucky as the two or three (?) floors below us would have looked onto the foliage and waterfall - though that wouldn't have been so bad as the pink flamingoes were beautiful. Service was great. The only niggle was the resort charges which are compulsory at approx $US25 a day for free self parking, gym access and internet etc - I guess if you used none of those it would be annoying. You have to pay additionally for access to the sauna etc which is located IN the Spa which my partner was irritated by as he figured the daily charge should cover that. We rented a car - I wouldn't bother next time as the resort has a shuttle from the airport - I'm pretty sure there was a shuttle into Lahaina (if not it's certainly not far and there is a little 'bus' service outside the resort) and all the 'tour' type things will pick you up from the resort. If you feel an overwhelming urge to explore the island the resort can organise a car for you for a couple of days. Note: Maui is a windy island - which I'd forgotten. If you are planning a boat tour suggest you leave it until the day before to book as if the wind is 'up' your day out may turn into a rough one and the tours/dives are not always refundable if you choose not to go because of rough conditions. Overall we really enjoyed our stay - we weren't looking for a 'boutique' hotel this trip - this is definitely a larger hotel with all amenities but it is done very stylishly, excellent amenities and service and I would definitely recommend it.

The hotel need major renovation. It shows ages inside of elevator, hallway, and bathroom. It even look \"cheap\" because grass cloth wallpaper was painted. If you stay at this hotel, DO NOT rent SUV. Parking spaces are so small and tight. You will have difficult time to find a spot, and if you are lucky enought, it is difficult to open the doors of SUV. In fact The concierges adviced us to ask the vallet desk to park the car if we cannot find a parking space. This is terrible, you have to drive around the parking area wishing you can find a space. Maid service was not sufficient. Our room was not cleaned after 3pm three times during our stay. Sometimes, glasses has lipstick marks on. I was not sure they just wash glasses at the sink in the room or change used ones. Used towel was left in the bathroom a couple of times.Our robes never hung up. \"Do not disturb\" tag was missing when we checked in, so we used in-room order tag with hand written \"Do not disturb\".

There were no problems with getting seats at the pool, no matter what time of day we were able to get 3 seats quite easy. The cost of food is comparable to restaurants in the local area depending on what you want to eat. The only negative was the cost of breakfast hence we ate out, and with the location right next to Whalers Village there is plenty of choice. Restaurants to visit - definitley Plantation House is a must for breakfast sensational view and really well priced meal, only 10 minutes from the hotel. Bubba Gumps if your into shrimp... we were very disappointed in the Lahaina Fish Company very pricey and our fish was overcooked and dry.. Kimos in Lahaina is worth a visit as well.

Given our stockpile of Starwood Points we returned to the Westin. Pros: Friendly staff, easy access to shopping, off property restaurants, short drives to Lahaina and Kapalua and a short walk to Black Rock and snorkeling. We saw turtles everyday and as many as (5) in one day in and around Black Rock. Note: Black Rock is a day excursion for the cruise ships that will port in Lahaina. When the ships are in Black Rock is a zoo. My advice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go first thing in the morning. The best snorkeling is at Honolua Bay. Cons: Pool: Even in the off season the pool area can get crowded. The pool has a theme park feel. Yes there is an adult pool area but the area fills quickly. Be sure to mark your desired spot before 8:00 AM. The earlier the better. The best spots were taken by 7:00 AM. Also, some guests don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to understand Adult Only, to include the hot tub. To the Westins credit the staff was quick to remind parents that the area is Adult Only. Cabana Reservations: If you want to reserve one of the private cabana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around the pool do so weeks in advance. Sunset Dinner: For the romantic the Sunset Dinner will set you back nearly $600.00 and are held in one of the Cabanas around the pool. For that reason there is little to no privacy and besides\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6$600.00!? We did it anyway and were disappointed. Elevator Noise: When you check-in ask to see your room. If you are within 2-3 rooms of an elevator \u00e2\u20ac\u201c move. Ocean Tower or Beach Tower: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in both. The Ocean Tower has the same pool view but a much better sunset view. Luau: Okay if you absolutely positively must attend a Luau, attend the Old Lahaina Luau in Lahaina. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their core business. The so called Luau at the Westin is not worth the price of admission. Trust me on this one. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve attended Laua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and from our balcony we watched three of them at the Westin. The so called Luau area is the same spot where weddings, receptions and conventions are held. Give the Old Lahaina Luau a try. As for dinner suggestions Mamas Fish House, The Plantation House and Merrimans are a must do. The Pineapple Grill in Kapalua was okay. A Sunset Dinner at Merrimans or the Plantation House will cost you $150 -$200 far less than the Westin. Give breakfast at the Gazebo Restaurant at Napili Shores a try. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the experience but get there early and I mean early. We arrived at 7:00 and were seated in 15 minutes. By 8:00 the wait was easily 45 minutes. Note of caution. When you book your trip you will receive a letter stating you have been assigned a personal concierge. Take note that the Personal Concierge will help you with dinner and excursion suggestions but first and foremost they are first line Vacation Ownership aka Timeshare sales reps.

We had a wonderful time and were very pleased to have landed this hotel through Priceline. I bid for it in November 2007 since I saw that Hotwire had it for $139 a night, so I figured Priceline had it too and voila, I got it. We stayed from 9/20 until 9/29. We have been to Maui numerous times. This was our first trip to the Westin having stayed previously at the Hyatt Regency four times, the Kaanapali Alii twice, the Sheraton once and the Whaler once. After staying at the Hyatt several times and being such a fan, I expected the Westin not to live up to the Hyatt. I was wrong. Although the Hyatt is a lovely property, the beach is not very good. They are both great properties, but each has its own distinct character. We arrived at 1:15 P.M. figuring that we'd have to wait to get into our room since check-in was at 3 p.m.. To our delight, not only did they have rooms ready, but the nice lady at check-in upgraded us to a partial ocean view room on the 4th floor. She was so accommodating. I asked her where our room would be and she said the 2nd or 3rd floor facing the waterfalls, so I asked her if we could have a high floor facing the mountains. I think she thought I was nuts for requesting a mountain view, and it was she who suggested the partial ocean view. We received Room 409 which is at the far end of the older tower, and we had the greatest view of the waterfall, the gardens and could see quite a bit of the ocean off to the left. A word of warning, be careful not to get rooms 401 or 403 since you will be sitting directly on the roof top. As others have mentioned, room is quite small but adequate. Appeared to be in pretty good condition except the drapes were too short [appeared to have shrunk] and lots of dust on the dark furniture. However, the housekeeping service did such a great job overall. We would always let them know when we were leaving so they could do our room promptly and they did, except for the 2 days when we forgot to tell them we were leaving, and the room wasn't done until around 3 p.m. Just tell them you want the room cleaned early and they are happy to oblige. Parking lot does fill up if you're not back to the hotel by 8:30, but the valet service was wonderful! They were always very efficient. We had such positive experiences with all the employees there from the bellmen to the check-in to the pool desk. We rented umbrellas at the pool desk just about every morning for the beach. Two loungers and an umbrella will set you back $25 plus tip, but it was soooo worth it. Most mornings we were there when the pool desk opened at 8:00 a.m. and some mornings we even got there at 7:45 a.m. and they opened early for us. It didn't seem necessary to be there so early on several of the day, however, since they still had umbrellas for rent as late as 11 a.m. But this past weekend they were sold out by 8:30. The only beef I had with this hotel is those who run out at 7 a.m. to reserve pool chairs. I went to the pool only one morning. The pool desk opens at 7:30, yet there were towels reserving every single one of the shady lounge chairs by the adult pool, so I asked the pool attendant what that was about and they stated that they have to wait an hour and only then will they \"tag\" the chair. Well, it used to be a 30-minute time limit, and when I did a walk-by later in the morning, most of the loungers were still sitting empty 3 hours later, so my advice to those wanting a pool chair in the shade is to simply take it upon yourselves to remove others towels if no one is at the pool. They're not supposed to be reserving chairs anyway. You can tell the chairs that aren't being used because they had only a towel and or a magazine. We only ate at Ono for lunch. It was decent, but we preferred the restaurants next door since hamburgers were $10.95 vs. $14 at Ono. We had the $29 breakfast buffet only one morning, but it was very good and worth it to us since it filled us up for both breakfast and dinner. Other recommendations: There is a Round Table Pizza at the Fairway Shops approximately 3/10ths of a mile from the resort. Round Table will deliver, but we went and brought our pizza back. It only took them 20 minutes to cook it. Right in the same plaza is a Deli/Restaurant called CJ's and they have hearty breakfasts for a fraction of the cost of the resorts, and very good breakfasts as well as great boxed lunches for Hana, and wonderful plate lunches. We also had dinner at CJ's and enjoyed the Mango Ribs and Mochichi chicken. We would be inclined to go to the Westin again if we got a reasonable price. We would not be inclined to go there if we had to pay over $250 a night, however. Because we got such a great rate, I think that made for a fantastic experience, but if we had paid full price I think I would be more fussy about the place.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medford, New York", "Title": "\u201cWestin Maui was wonderful\u201d", "Author": "MelG8", "ReviewID": "UR20507149", "Content": "This resort was paradise.

Pros: The resort is beautiful. 5 pools, lovely beach, great location, comfy beds, clean rooms, prompt and efficient maid service. Loved the location next to Whaler's Village and convenient walk to Black Rock for snorkeling. These two things more than made up for the cons listed below. We snorkeled twice a day at Black Rock and saw sea turtles and spotted rays, along with beautiful reefs and tropical fish. Can't stop thinking about the amazing things we saw there. It's a must do! At Whaler's Village, you must stop at Hagen Daaz and try their Big Island Dazzler sundae. There's a $1 off coupon in the Maui guide right inside Hagen Daaz. It's a scoop of coconut and pineapple ice creams, shortbread macadamia nut cookies, chocolate covered macadamia nuts and whipped cream on top for $7.50 before the coupon. We were addicted to these! Room was quiet and maid service was prompt and impeccable. Two free bottles of water per day and an empty refrigerator for your own items. Helped keep the costs down on breakfast and cocktails. Cons: Even after Labor Day, the hotel was extremely busy. Had to be up by 7 a.m. to get to the pool stand to grab beach towels to put on chairs at adult pool or you'd be out of luck trying to get a spot in the shade. Pools were freezing cold. Compared temps to pools at Sheraton and Hyatt and Westin pools were definitely much colder. Parking fills up quickly and spaces are rediculously narrow. If parking is full, they will valet for you at no extra cost, but then you're stuck waiting for car hop and tipping valet. Internet access was out for 3 of the 7 days that we were there. Only refunded $25 even though there is a $25 daily resort fee, of which part of that goes to internet access. Took the time share pitch for a $100 resort credit. Supposed to be only 90 minutes. Our gal tried to go over that time limit and we insisted we needed to go as we had no interest in buying and had met our end of the agreement. She got huffy with us if we objected to anything she said in the presentation and was huffy when we told her we were leaving. Not as low pressure as other reviewers led us to believe it would be. All in all, we would definitely stay at the Westin again if we could get a promotional rate, but not sure we'd pay the $400 per night fee that's standard. Other recommondations: Sansei restaurant is a must. We ate at their Kapalua location twice and would have eaten there every night if we had tried it sooner. Sunday and Monday nights arrive by 5 p.m. for their 25% off all food promotion until 6 p.m. Lines form early as locals get 50% off--must show a valid Hawaiian driver's license to get that deal. But 25% if still worth it. Other must do: eat breakfast at the Gazebo Restaurant in Napli. Try the macadamia nut pancakes with coconut syrup. To die for.

Overall we weren't that impressed. We've stayed at a few other Ka'anapali hotels and condos. The hotel and grounds are wonderful as is the staff (very friendly). However, it wasn't family friendly and not a good value. Why? First, the pools. All pools are 4 feet deep. Our 6 year old is tall for his age and is 3 ft 11 inches tall. There's no kid's beach or similar area as there is at other area resorts. The \"kids\" water slide is a joke. You're not able to even slide down it since there's no real slope and everyone sticks to the slide the whole way down. The large slide is ok. Second, the kids camp is more of an afterthought vs. a true amenity. We tried using it twice for our 6 year old and both days someone had called in sick so there were no counselors. The camp looked very small. Age limits are 5-12 years old so our 4 year old couldn't go at all. Both were looking forward to the activities presented online. I believe the State of Hawaii has just changed the lower age limit from 3 to 5 for hotel day care facilities. Third, food prices are too high. Yes, I know this is a resort and pricing will be high, but $28 for a breakfast buffet? $5.50 for a machine-made latte? The quality isn't like it is at other nearby resorts. Our first morning, we grabbed two small OJ's from the cafe and were surprised each was $6.30. We noticed there was no price tag and pointed this out. Throughout the week, there never was a price tag. Same thing for the fruit plate. Careful with your kids grabbing food without knowing the prices:)! Lastly, this doesn't have to do with family-focused travel, but we noticed that timeshare is everywhere at this hotel. It's in the lobby, it's all all the activity desks, it's out by the pool, it's in one full wing of the ground floor. These folks are focused. Part of me thinks their goal is to convert all Westin Hotel visitors into Westin timeshare owners at the other Ka'anapali resort property. That property is definitely a better fit for families and those wishing to avoid the high costs associated with resort travel.

It was our first trip to Maui and we decided on the Westin because of its location and the fact that we got a pretty good deal. We did get the lei greeting when we arrived. At check in we were upgraded to a room in the beach tower (had only booked a garden view). Our room was a spacious king with a killer view. We did have a problem where we kept hearing water run through the pipes every 1-2 minutes for the entire night - not very peaceful. The Westin rectified the situation by moving us to the exact same room at the other end of the hall. No more noise at night! The hotel was large and filled with people. There are a lot of kids which could be a drawback to some. This wasn't a big issue for us. The pools were nice - we stayed by the adult pool but it fills up quickly. You need to get to the pool by 8 or so to get chairs. Beware - the flagstone gets super hot around the pools!! Make sure you put some flip flops on before strolling around. The location was great - right next to Whaler's Village. There is a great path that runs all the way down Ka'anapali Beach. This is a good place to run early in the morning (distance of the path about 1.3 mi). I can still picture myself jogging and looking over at the ocean! There is a shuttle that takes you to Lahaina. We utilized this service often - Lahaina is a charming town. There are tons of shops and restaurants and is very laid back. The restaurants are pretty good. We had the breakfast buffet one morning. It's a little pricey, but the food was good. We had lunch at Ono's a couple of times as well - very good. The shave ice at the stand by the pool is great!

If you are looking for a quiet, serene setting, this may not be the resort for you. The Westin adds a mandatory resort fee of $20/day to the room charges. Our room was not upgraded upon check-in (unlike many others who have reported receiving a room upgrade). I was told an upgrade to partial ocean view would cost an additional $145 per night! We were given a room with a mountain view, looking toward the golf course. Because it also looks over the parking lot, many times a day we heard sounds of car alarms and delivery trucks beeping in reverse. Our room was very small and nicely decorated, but in need of maintenance. The sliding glass door did not seal and the wind whistled through the panes all day and night. The toilet leaked every day and we had cock roaches in the room. Several light bulbs were burned out and the TV remote had a dead battery. The staff was prompt at tending to these issues when we mentioned them, but a guest should not have to point these out in a 5 star hotel. The housekeeping was very good, and supplied us daily with water, coffee and toiletries. The Heavenly beds are amazingly comfortable for sleeping, but we also had to use them for in-room dining since the room did not accommodate a table or chairs for this purpose. We spent time at the adult pool, where we had to claim a spot by 7:00am. Several guests reserved lounge chairs with towels, and would return hours later. I did witness some monitoring of the lounge chairs by resort staff, but it was not strictly enforced. The poolside service for food and beverages was great. If you prefer to swim in water above 75 degrees, I recommend the ocean because the resort pools are not heated. The resort is located on a very beautiful, clean, safe beach front. The Westin rents beach chairs and umbrellas to guests for $26+ tip per day and these also get reserved quickly so get there by 8:00am to rent an umbrella. We did not use the spa services since we had sticker shock from the prices. Instead we found Third Heaven Spa just a mile up the road and had more than 2 hours of relaxing treatments at a fraction of the cost Westin charges. The Westin is located next to Whalers Village where dining and shopping options are plentiful. Hula Grill was our favorite. They make the best Mai tai's!!! Overall, our Westin experience was good.

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed at many different types of hotels and different ranges. I'm quite disappointed with the level of service at this Westin. After a long international flight from Japan, another domestic flight to Maui and securing a rental car, we arrive at Westin where I expected it to be a high class hotel with a nice welcome. Upon arrival, the valets were too deep in conversation with each other and ignored us, there were no bell boys to help with our luggage or golf bags, the was no lei greeter (there was a rack with some leis on it by the door that I didn't notice til day 2). Now I probably wouldn't complain about all this - except that we paid over $300 a night and I've stayed at less expensive hotels that have provided amazing service! Even the Outrigger Resort Waikiki we stayed at next (for the same price) was alot better - their staff was on top of everything! We had a Garden View room w/King bed - nice view of garden, pool, and beach. However it is pretty small and I've stayed in small hotels in Japan! Even more ridiculous is the $20 per day fee they tack on for: - Admission to WestinWORKOUT\u00c2\u00ae - High Speed Internet Access in your guestroom and public areas - Self-Parking - Shuttle service to Kapalua West Maui Airport, upon availability - Shuttle service to Ka'anapali golf and tennis facilities upon availability - Westin Maui souvenir shopping bag - Two (2) bottles of water replenished daily - Outdoor portrait sitting and free 4 by 6 color photograph through Westin Maui Photography Give me a break - this is the Westin! It should all be included in the rate. Bottles of water are normally complimentary at other hotels. I have to pay for self-parking as a guest? And who wants a Westin souvenir shopping bag? (which by the way is a small gift bag with a picure of the hotel on it). Taxes and fees are another $30 - so remember to $50/day on top of what your rate is. Be aware that this is a very, very crowded hotel with a very very crowded pool, if that's not your thing, then this wouldn't be it for you (Check out the private & romantic Mama's Fishhouse Inn). Good things - the restaurant food was excellent, even just at the outdoor bar & restaurant by the pool, and the concierge lady we worked with was very helpful and gave good recommendations. There is also an adult only pool. The hotel is beautiful w/an indoor / outdoor feel. Overall - I will not stay here again nor would I recommend it to my friends.

I absolutely love the waterfall in the lobby! We had our picture taken from behind the fall. Check in was swift and easy, though the attendant could have been a bit friendlier. She was not rude but I expected more. Maybe that's a southern thing. The hotel itself is very nice, clean and the rooms are great and sound proof. Soft plush bed, plenty of space in the room, lovely bathroom, made with marble tile, the view from the balcony was beautiful, even though we were over the top of one of the restaurants. To get up in the mornings to the view of the ocean was just fantastic so much so that after the first day we didn't notice the rooftop again. The pools are laid out nicely. The kiddie and family pools are seperate from the adult pool. That was VERY nice! The restaurants were expensive but we expected that. We had our morning breakfast buffet included in our package. I think the price was $25. I thought that was acceptable considering the variety of items available. I loved the guy who made our omelettes in the mornings. He was very friendly. So was all of the wait staff. One thing I LOVED about this hotel was that on the other side of the hotel was a shopping plaza. In that plaza there was a tiny Mcdonalds, a pizza eatery , mexican eatery that also made subs, and a chinese eatery. The prices were exceptional and the food was very good! Now this place is not part of the Westin but it's just around the back of the hotel. That was a welcome find because you get tired of spending $25 for a cheeseburger and fries. OH!!! the snorkeling is great right out in front of the hotel and especially about 300 yards down from the hotel. For me the only draw backs were that the parking lot would fill up very quickly BUT, BUT the valet staff would then park your car for FREE! So you can't beat that. The front desk staff were less friendly than I would have expected but the concierge were VERY friendly and knowledgable. The hotel had poker games on, I believe Tues and Friday (only 8 seats avail.) but you could only play for drink tickets.

This is a family oriented place with lots of kids as long as you don't get annoyed by them you will be fine and they do have an adult only pool. The ocean is the best and the beach area wonderful. Make sure to go down to Black Rock for great snorkeling. The food at the hotel was excellent and yes pricey but hey your in Maui what do you expect. There is A 20.00 resort fee which is common wherever you go. All the employees we dealt with were so nice and helpful. Room was always cleaned by at least 11am and they did a good job.

The first room was totally gross wet towels all over, very hot in room and shower was full of sand, we changed room and the next one was better but still had washclothes in shower and someone elses hair.

After I playfully objected she said \"okay, we'll leave it at $20\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This hotel is perfectly located on one of the best beaches on Maui. You can walk right up the beach to Black Rock, a great snorkeling spot. There's shopping and restaurants right next door but, it's just as expensive there as it is in the hotel. You gotta remember this is Maui and everything everywhere is going to be expensive. Even McDonalds is almost twice as much here as at home. The open lobby was very picturesque with a pond that had flowing waterfalls, swans and pink flamingos. We stayed in the \"Beach Tower\"(deluxe ocean view). The room (#681) was a nice size, tastefully decorated and came with plush bathrobes. I'm 6ft tall though and found the robes a little on the small side. We had an awesome view of the beach right up to Black Rock with Moloka'i as a backdrop and could watch the sunset from our lanai(it wasn't the best angle but you could see it). The bathroom was large enough for a double sink, which my wife loved, and a separate toilet area. The double showerhead with massage action was also a nice touch. The \"Heavenly Bed\" was very comfortable the first night but, seemed to sag more and more each night. Housekeeping could have been a little better too. The room seemed to be kind of dusty when we arrived, as though it had been empty for a long time. They don't do a great job of making a bed either. On our 2nd night a water pipe burst on the 11th floor sending water down to the floors below and I'm sure spoiling the vacation of some guests. Fortunately our room wasn't affected but there was water on the floor in our hallway that cut off some rooms from the elevator. The next morning it was gone with no bad smells or any sign that it had even happened but I can't speak for those who were directly affected. The pool area overlooking the ocean is huge for a hotel but we never used it, opting instead for the beach.

You had to get out to the pool by 7am if you wanted a good seat.; the pool was freezing (70 degrees), the food and drinks were poor quality (Ono's) and VERY overpriced (even for Maui standards), You had to pay for any seating on the beach,and the beach sloped down quite a bit making it not so great for young kids. A bigger issue: the staff was so awful - the first room they put us in was water damaged...carpet pulled back and everything, we called the front desk and after being on hold for 10 minutes, they switched us to another room. This new room wasn't as nice as the first (well, it didn't have the water damage, but it also didn't have the nice partial ocean view). They would not upgrade us nor give us another room. They couldn't have cared less. When we left early, no one asked why. This is a resort that really doesn't care about quality, it's all about quantity.

Alot of people save seats. I was not going to do this but after 4 days of being in the sun I needed shade so my son saved me a spot at 7 am, and trust me most were taken already.

From the moment we checked in we ran into multiple problems and rude staff. We are Gold SPG members and had hoped for an upgrade, but were not given one. There were 3 in our party, but they did not have a room with doubles so they had to give us a king room and then move us the next day. It would have been nice to unpack the first day vs having to move rooms. Plus, they told us our old keys would work on our new room - my husband dropped us off while he ran an errand and when I discovered my key did not work I went to the front desk to have them correct the problem and they would not give me another key since I did not have my drivers license with me. I appreciate their attentiveness to security and all, but they left my son and me stranded in the lobby until my husband came back because they gave me wrong information about the key working vs giving me a new key to begin with. I told them I could give them any other kind of proof, but they would not accept anything except my DL. This hotel is so caught up in their \"rules\" that they put that before helping a guest. The rooms are some of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in! There are no closets either so with three people, luggage all over the place, and no closet to put things in it was very cramped to say the least. The pool was always over crowded and we had lots of trouble finding chairs. The Good: The slides and pool itself were nice. The restaurants seemed to be pretty good. The location and proximity to Whalers Village was wonderful. We have stayed at the Marriott and the Sheraton on Kaanapaili Beach before and would pick either of those over the Westin any day. See my review for the Sheraton Maui that I recently posted. From what I can see, this hotel sells the package deals and they have 100's of families in and out of the hotel all the time on the cheaper packages vs the Sheraton does not have that going for them so the customer service was much much better down there. If you are a SPG member I would highly recommend the Sheraton any day!!!", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "yogab", "ReviewID": "UR18583101", "Content": "Just returned from an 8 day stay at the Westin: Room: We loved the beautiful sunsets from our ocean front room located in the Beach Tower.

The pictures on their website to reflect the beauty of the hotel. Here are some points about the hotel... - The Beach - it is wide enough to play on - there are places south of this hotel where the beach is quite narrow. But, this beach was great. The hotel has lots of umbrella's available on the beach for a fee - I think it was $25 for the day. Beware that the tide is strong here and there is a drop off about 10 feet into the water - although it is still only about 4 ft deep after the drop off. Note that you cannot really surf right outside the hotel, but you can walk south along the beach for 5 minutes to find a place to surf. - The pools - beautiful. They are cool, which is great for the weather. The waterfalls and also great. There is one waterslide that is good, and the other is very short and good for little kids. - The rooms - this will be our only complaint about the hotel. Our room itself was fine - we were upgraded to a room with a view, so that was great. But, the housekeeping service was poor. I often had no decaf coffee, when I left a note specifically requesting it; we had days where we had one towel, but there were three of us in the room; shampoo/conditioner was often not replaced when emptied; water was often not provided. I called to the front desk to get some of these items fixed, but they continued to happen. - Resort fee - there is a $20 daily resort fee - it is not optional. It gets you access to their gym, 2 water bottles/day, a free 4x6 picture of your party and free self parking. - Workout facilities - these were good - a nice view of the pools from them. There is an outdoor running route that they have defined for you that is 3 miles long - be aware that it is taking you along some very busy roads. In the workout room, there is another route drawn out - takes you up a big hill, but I thought it was a better route as there was no where near the amount of traffic. - Concierge - there are many concierge desks and they were always willing to help! - Parking - often, their parking lot will fill up, but they will valet park your vehicle for free when that happens, so it's all good! Overall, our trip was great - the housekeeping service didn't spoil the hotel for us - but, being it was a Westin, I was expecting better housekeeping service. It is definitely a family oriented hotel and it is right next to the Whalers shopping center which was great for gifts and the little things you forget.

Unfortunately, they were not met at this hotel. Upon entering the lobby, I was impressed with their lagoon with cascading waterfalls, fish pond, resident parrots and flamingos, but my impression quickly turned sour when I entered our hotel room. The hotel rooms are the smallest I've ever been in - the concierge told me that it was originally designed for Japanese tourists - (read: small). My husband, myself and 2 children (9 and 11) were very uncomfortable with our belongings strewn everywhere. The pluses: The pools were lovely and not crowded even in peak vacation season. There is also a separate pool designated for adults fand a tiny hot tub adjacent. My kids loved the winding waterslide. The property is located right on a very nice beach which had some waves for the kids' boogie boards. Their trademark \"Heavenly Beds\" DID live up to their hype. We all slept very well in the comfy (albeit small double) beds. We avoid eating at the hotel restaurants due to the cost, but sometimes it can't be helped. The poolside restaurant (O'no Bar & Grill) actually had some very good food (pizza, chicken sandwich, nachos) that wasn't too outrageously priced. Note! Although Westin is linked with the Sheraton chain and you can EAT there, rent sports gear there (spend money there), you CANNOT use their pool. Our concierge person neglected to tell us this which led to a very embarrassing situation when we visited the Sheraton property next door. When I returned to the Westin I spoke with the manager and she was not at all apologetic and made me feel like I'd done something wrong. Needless to say, I was not happy. Which leads me to say that the staff was not as friendly as I'd expected. One woman at the concierge desk was quite rude while assisting me with printing boarding passes. This was our third trip to Hawaii, but first time for Maui and we absolutely fell in love with it, but we will not be returning to a Westin property. Also - DO NOT go the the Hyatt's Luau (Drums of the Pacific). I was aghast at the amateurish performance of the dancers. One guy kept making mistakes and constantly looking at the other guys for guidance. One of the girls looked like she was 12 years old. The brochure said we'd be witnessing some cultural exhibits - it turned out that they had tables selling overpriced souveneirs. At the beginning of the lual, we were encouraged to have photographs taken by their photographers ($20 for a 4X6 and 8X10). This \"luau\" felt more like an orchestrated scheme to have visitors part with more of their money. I was so turned off.

The cons of the Westin: unless you are one of these grabby people who \"reserve\" pool chairs all day for the 2 hours they will use them, forget about getting a seat by the pool. Having nowhere to sit gets old after a week, and reduces your enjoment of the property - management should do something about this (since usually, over half the chairs are \"reserved\" but empty).

Upon arrival our room was ready and we were upgraded to an Ocean View room. Check-in was speedy and we were at the pool in no-time. My only real complaint about this hotel is that the rooms are a little small when you have 4 people in them (2 double beds). Other than that the rooms had been upgraded with newer bath amenities and flat screen TV's. During our stay we really enjoyed the pools and waterslides. The ocean was also great and we spent some time body surfing in there. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The waterfall in the lobby area is quite impressive and makes a stunning impact when you arrive at the hotel. We ate at Ono's and the Tropica restaurants.

Turn down service didnt even happen the first 2 nights of our 4 night stay in an oceanfront suite. when we complained, they made promises that didnt pan out. They seem to want to make the attempt at superior customer service, but just dont execute like the 4 seasons or a Fairmont property (like the Kea Lani we stayed at just prior). No less than 4 different members of managment made customer service promises about turn down service, wristbands for the pool the night prior , etc, that never happened.

Rental Car voucher was included for $185 and I received a $100 resort credit upon check-in. If I wanted to participate in the Westin Vacation Villa Ownership presentation (which was 2 hours in length and they weren't that pushy), I would receive an additional $100 resort credit. So that would be $200 of resort credit and if I wanted to use that towards a room upgrade, the credit would be doubled to $400. When I checked in, they offered me a room overlooking the parking lot and the golf course on the 3rd floor in the Ocean Tower (which wasn't a bad view). I asked the front desk agent to upgrade to an ocean view room and I was given three options : 1) I could use my Starwood points toward an ocean view room, but that would have been 5,500 points per night (27,500 total) 2) Pay $450 ($90/night + occupancy tax) cash for the upgrade or 3) Use the resort credit toward the room upgrade. To maximize my use of the resort credit, the agent told me to take the vacation villa presentation and then I would have $400 of resort credit to use for the room upgrade. By upgrading the room would cost $450 total ($90/night), but since I would have $400 of resort credit, it would only cost me an extra $50 and the corresponding occupancy tax ($10.27/night). So at the end of the day, I'm only out $101.35 for the partial ocean view upgrade and $100 for the resort fee. The front desk agent was even nice enough to give me the keys in advance to inspect the rooms to make sure that room met my expectation for the price paid. I opted for the resort credit usage and what that got me was Room 284 in the Beach Tower. This room is located about 3 rooms from the end of the tower closest toward the beach. It offered a slim view of the mountains, a view of the lower pool and a partial ocean view. The only bad part was that since the room was located on the 2nd floor (and this floor was designated as a Starwood Preferred Guest floor), my balcony looked out over the mezzanine rooftop which contained trash that guests from higher floors had obviously dropped onto it. A lot of people have complained about the size of the rooms. If you want a bigger room, you should opt for a room in the Beach Tower. Those rooms have about 250 more square feet in them than in the Ocean Tower. They have a full walk-in closet and the balconies are larger (the Ocean Tower rooms only have an armoire/no closet). The bathrooms are also significantly larger in the Beach Tower rooms. The only drawback in the Beach Tower rooms is that you don't have the bar sink that you'll find in the Ocean Tower rooms. You basically have a table stand with the coffee pot and cups on it. Aside from the rooms, the hotel is in great shape for being almost 25 years old. The staff did a great job overall and yes, there were issues with people reserving pool chairs as early as 6am. However, I did notice pool attendants walking around noting which chairs had been vacant for longer than 30-45 minutes. If you get to the pool around 8am, you should not have a problem securing your favorite spot. And the staff did a great job of policing the kids from the adult pool. The restaurant food was okay at the Ono Bar and Grill and the Westin's Tropica Restaurant food was highly over-priced ! Just walk down 30 steps from the Tropica and you've got Leilani's, Hula Grill and the Rusty Harpoon which had excellent food at reasonable prices. One more thing about this property. Several years ago, the concierge made it a point to inform the guests that there is a professional photographer on staff (by the American Express Tour desk) who will take photos of you and your family for free. This service still exists, but they don't mention it to you, so make sure you ask the front desk about this service. You have to make a reservation in advance, but they take you to the most picturesque spots at the resort and the results are great !

We felt that Kaanapali would be the best location in Maui for the kids and I think they were right. The hotel grounds and lobby are beautiful and well-tended although they could use more trash cans around the pool areas. The pools were clean and warm with a water slide and waterfalls that the kids really enjoyed. The beach is directly next to the pool area and was great for swimming and playing. The surf was very low in front of the Westin but was better for bodysurfing down near the Marriott Ocean Club. Good service around the pools and they do make an attempt to prevent people from reserving all the lounge chairs first thing in the morning by flagging those chairs left unattended for more than 30 minutes. Still, it was very crowded when we were there and hard to find chairs near any shade throughout the day. The hotel room was pretty small but was clean and well maintained. Tight quarters with 2 double beds for 2 adults and our 13 and 11 yr old. Our \"partial ocean view\" room had a great view of the pools and beach though the patio was too hot in the afternoon to sit outside during cocktail hour. We did not eat many meals at the Westin since the prices seemed very high (even for Hawaii) and we had a few dinners at the next-door shopping area of Whaler's Village as well as in the town of Lahaina. The upstairs/fine dining parts of Leilani's and the Hula Grill both impressed us with great fish dishes and were much better than the beachside/bar food parts of each restaurant. There is also a food court (think delisandwiches and Panda Express) which were convenient for cheaper meals for the kids who are not fish fans. I really think you must rent a car to appreciate all of Maui and also to get to Lahaina for dinner/strolling/shopping. It's only about a 10 minute car ride. There is also a Safeway supermarket on the way which came in handy for breakfast and lunch items for the hotel room instead of spending $100 for the breakfast buffet every morning. We stayed for 9 nights and stayed busy the whole time. We drove to the Haaleakala crater for sunrise one morning, took a Molokini snorkel trip aboard the Maui Magic (great crew, BBQ lunch and snorkeling), parasailed with UFO tours (sign up on the beach in front of the Westin) and golfed in Kaanapali (across the street from the hotel) and on the nearby island of Lanai at the Manele Bay course(accessed by 45 minute ferry ride). Dining in Lahaina was great at Kimo's and the Mai Tai Lounge (try to sit upstairs at one of their lounge tables at sunset).Also recommend Mama's Fishhouse on the north side of the island for dinner as well as the Paia fish market which we visited on our last day since it was closer to the airport. Tried Maui Tacos once but we were not impressed. We purchased snorkel gear and boogie boards at home and brought them with us to avoid high rental costs. I'm told you can also buy these at the Costco near the airport but we were not members. The only complaints about the trip are the crazy jet lag returning to the midwest (5 hr time difference), the high cost of everything in Hawaii and the too-close-for-comfort feeling of living with 4 people in 1 hotel room for 9 days.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and had a relaxing vacation in the tropics of Maui. Here are some items we noted: Renting a car is a must! First, shuttles/taxis costs between $50-80 each way from the airport. We rented a car for $130 for the whole week! There is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd self-parking at the resort, so you might as well take them up on it. I say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because it is included in the mandatory $20-per-day fee. There are exorbitant prices within and around the resort. I expected some inflation, but it was over $7 for two small cups of seltzer water (no alcohol) at the bar. So using the car to venture out to the local Safeway and less expensive restaurants was a real plus. And while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at it, check out the other beaches and attractions that Maui has to offer! The lagoon-style pools were awesome! We really liked all the waterfalls and the waterslide was fun. The beach and pools were pretty crowded, but there is good snorkeling at the Westin north of the Black Rock. You can park for free in their lot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to bring your towel (they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you one unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at that particular Westin)! I was disappointed in the food overall\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI thought there would be more authentic Hawaiian food, but most of the places were geared toward the haulis\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlots of steakhouses, diners, and fast food.

No microwave in the room. Given that buying food outside of the resort is a must, it would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been nice to be able to heat something up in the room. But we did have a small fridge and coffee maker (although we had to buy our own coffee grounds because the \"Kona coffee\" provided was undrinkable). No DVD player in the room. A minor compliant, but given that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much on the 30 channels they offered, it was a little annoying.

The rooms are nicely appointed, albeit, some rooms still are \"dirty\" based on our conversations with other guests. Now the cons: The staff is indifferent. The elevators can be full of people (in the Ocean tower). The pool can be overrun with kids. The part of Ka`anapali Beach that the Hotel sits on is not as wide as other parts (e.g., fronting the Sheraton Maui adjacent to Black Rock). Self-park gets full early in the evening forcing you to valet when the Hotel is at or near capacity (although they waive the charge). Regular rooms are on the smaller side. Although not as nice, one might consider staying at the Sheraton Maui down the road. The rooms are larger, the staff is a bit friendlier, SPG Gold/Plats will likely receive better recognition, the beach is wider, there are fewer waits for the elevator when the Hotel is full, and there's less of a likelihood that the Hotel will force you to valet your car as they have a larger parking lot for the number of rooms available.

Nothing was missing, and maybe I forgot to close it since I had to leave early that morning for Hana. Coupled with the way my bed was made, I had my doubts. It seems like someone finished making the bathroom, and then did something to rush through the bedroom. Now I'm not a picky guy. I've been know to overlook details others will not tolerate.

I booked using the cash and points option from Starwood which was awesome-4000 points+$90 a night! I have Gold Status, but wasn't sure if we would get upgraded due to booking partially with points, but we did! Garden View was what we booked, but we got Ocean View! The hotel has all the ameneties you need and has about the most wonderful beach and warm ocean water you could ever imagine. Great snorkeling is just down the beach at Black Rock and the pools are awesome. The breakfast buffet was absolutely scrumptous and the work out facility is excellent-but it does get busy. The staff is friendly and happy to help you schedule activities and the concierge is very helpful. Go to The Gazebo for breakfast! You will have to wait at least 30 minutes-but it is worth it! If I had to make a recommendation of staying here and when we do it again for a stay of say, 3 nights or longer-I would go to the ABC store and purchase 2 chairs or loungers and an umbrella to use on the beach. The Westin will charge you $25/day for this combo and if you have a 7 night stay, it will add up. You can also do just loungers, which I think is $10 and but the umbrella for like $15. The beach is so wonderful, I can't imagine why so many people spend so much time at the pool. The rooms are very nice, although not huge. The service for the rooms is excellent as they seemingly know immediately when you have left the rooms. The decks are not large, but enough to sit and read a book for two and have a drink. Also of note is that if you go during high season, the hotel and nearby restaurants, etc. will be busy. This is where Maui gets a frown from some people because there are just too many people. Not a Westin problem, but just something to think about when discussing whether to spend time on West Maui vs. South, which doesn't get nearly as busy. The Westin Maui is a wonderful experience that is not completely upscale, but in a way that is good. It's real people having a REALLY good time vs. the semi-sterile environment of The Four Seasons.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Setting, Relax Or Be Active\u201d", "Author": "Tredpositive", "ReviewID": "UR16850130", "Content": "Westin Maui Resort treated us like royality as Platinum SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) members by upgrading us to oceanfront suite!

With all these member discounts and benefits staying at Westin Maui was both more affordable and easy! One of our best meals on Maui or any other island was enjoyed at Westin's oceanfront Tropica Restaurant, with live entertainment, ocean breezes, torches glowing, attentive service and all of our meals exceptional! Tropica also offers Happy Hour 3-5:30. Ono's Restaurant in evening also offers live entertainment, great casual dining with good food and bar as well. Ono's serves breakfast buffet which we recommend, as ordering off menu is almost as much as extensive buffet. Colonnade Cafe is great for quick cont'l breakfast items or delicious sandwich, salad, excellent smoothies, etc at reasonable prices. The Beach Bar located on upper level of pool complex at Adult Pool/Jacuzzi deck serves convenient great appetizers (pupus) and fab drinks. Beach Bar also has live entertainment 5:30-7:30, also Happy Hour 8-10pm. Between all their Happy Hours, free nightly entertainment and varied food/restaurant choices all set in gorgeous gardens, huge pool/waterfall complex, tropical birds, beach, and ocean sounds guests really need not go anywhere else to enjoy their vacation! Kaanapali Beach is excellent walking (sand and/or paved walkway), swimming, body surfing, snorkeling: best at Black Rock in front of Sheraton and other side in front of Westin Villas (free shuttle to both). Whaler's Village next door has many excellent restaurants some with live entertainment and lots of shopping. Lahania Town is 10 minutes away with more delicious oceanfront restaurants and more shopping. We booked highly recommended 5 hr snorkel cruise on Quicksilver boat thru Boss Frogs in Lahania. Best price offered with cont'l breakfast and grilled to order luncheon, sails to Molokini Crater and over to Moloaki Island for excellent snorkeling. Also, booked Air Maui Helicopter Tour of West Maui and Molokai Island thru Boss Frogs, again best price. Air Maui has most up-to-date helicopter with thick cushioned seats, individual air ventilation and wide windows for viewing. First heli tour I've taken and not gotten air sick because there was plenty of proper ventilation! Don't forget to rent vehicle and explore Maui's many coasts. Driving to Maui's South beaches is very scenic and enjoyable day out exploring and beach hoping. In front of Grand Wailea Resort is Wailea Beach. Grand Wailea has basically cut off any public parking access so have to drive past to Fairmont Kea Lani parking lots. Walk thru beautiful Kea Lani foyer, downstairs past lovely pools out to Polo Beach, which is lovely and quiet. If you want to get over to Wailea Beach to right there is easy garden lined with wonderful views concrete walkway which lets out in front of Hyatt Regency and Grand Wailea. BUT, further down past resorts is Big Beach with it's own public parking lotS and well worth the find! Wide, long, deep soft sand with lots of body surfing, boggie boarding and surfing to be had. Don't miss booking Old Lahania Luau way before vacationing on Maui. Best luau we've ever attended by being well organized, beautiful beachfront setting, delicious food and fabulous entertainment from time walking in to leaving stuffed and buzzed with top shelf drinks all night long. Cabs are relatively inexpensive, easy to pickup at end of evening waiting across street and best way to safely enjoy your luau evening. Best vacation Investment is Maui Revealed The Ultimate Guidebook with accurate and essential directions, restaurant and resort reviews, beaches, snorkeling, horseback riding, hiking, ziplining, etc knowledge of Maui!

The hotel is beautiful. There are several pools, all with great ocean views. The staff at the poolside areas were fantastic. Food at poolside restaurants was very good, and bar service excellent. Probably the most helpful thing at the Westin for us was the use of the \"hospitality suite.\" Our plane didn't leave until 10pm on our last day, so we took a snorkeling trip that day and then came back to the Westin to use the \"hospitality suite\" to shower and get ready for our flight. On the downside, our room, which was \"upgraded\" to ocean view, was really a view of the airconditioning unit(see included pictures). Also, everywhere you turn at the Westin, someone is trying to get you to buy a \"Vacation Ownership\" aka timeshare. This got old after awhile. The concierge was helpful, but also directed us to the timeshare presentations. The excursions she offered to book for us were more than double the price we paid elsewhere. The other thing we didn't like about the Westin is that you get nickled and dimed for everything. For example, to rent a cabana for the day $60, to use towels $25, to take a yoga class $10, etc. All of this is in addition to the $20 per day \"resort fee.\" In addition the parking is terrible, with folks often double and triple parked in the small lot when we were there. This forces you to valet park, which is another $10. I would prefer to stay somewhere were all of these charges are included in the price of your room.

I had compared many of the hotels in Ka'anapali for my family's vacation and the Westin was my best guess. It was the right choice. After our 8 night stay, my family doesn't want to go anywhere else for our future vacations. The hotel is the best on the beach for my wife and five year old son who love the beach and water. I can't count how many times we went down the slide or played in the grotto. We went up to the Sheraton which was our second choice and it was very nice but the pool was not near as nice as the Westin's. We also didn't see any kids at the Sheraton which could be a positive if you are looking for a romantic getaway which would be more difficult at the Westin due to the kids. But if you are traveling with kids, the Westin is perfect. We didn't use the Kid's Club but did stop in and it looked to be run very well. The staff was very friendly and my son didn't want to leave after he found the games and toys there. But a quick mention of the pool and he was off like a shot. The rooms at the Westin are acceptable. We had to change out of the first room due to the wallpaper falling off the wall in the bathroom. It looked like that was more the exception than the rule. The next room was OK even though the cleaning people weren't perfect. I enjoyed reading all the notes the previous tenant had made on the weekly schedule that wasn't changed out and the counter tops were sticky with I don't know what. After that first day though, they picked it up and kept the room very clean. They didn't have the king sized bed we requested but it actually worked out well having two beds which were awesome. My wife usually can't sleep in hotels but these beds put her right out. The breakfast buffet included in our package was an excellent value. It generally filled us up for the majority of the day with the plentiful fruit selection and omelet station which will cook any style of eggs for you, yes, even an egg white only one if that's your style. If you are going to do the breakfast, ask for a table at Tropica, their beach front restaurant. This was offered to us the first day and we asked for it every time after that since it wasn't offered again. Sitting at Tropica puts you right next to the beach for a beautiful view instead of watching the pool activities. Also, ask for the smoothies in the morning, they usually have a different flavor they offer a small serving of but we had to ask for it several times. The beach is a wonderful soft gold sand that was just what my wife was looking for. The water was crystal clear and you can even just walk right out into the water and snorkel for a great time. The fish are there, just go before too late in the afternoon when the water starts to get a little warmer and they move out to the deeper areas. We got an umbrella and chairs for several days. It is around $26 for two chairs and an umbrella until 4:00pm. They will only put out 20 umbrellas each day so once these are sold, they are done. You can get your umbrella first thing in the morning and then come back whenever, you paid for it, the staff won't mess with it. I asked about the wooden chair cabana type seats which they sell at the pool towel desk and they run for around $55 a day and have a half day for around $35. These chairs are not on the sand but offer wait service so you don't even have to get up at all during the day. If you are looking for a snorkeling adventure, we did the Gemini tour which was fine. The boat only holds around 45-49 people max and we only had 24 on the boat. It is a nice 4 hour tour with a motor trip up the coast and then we actually sailed back to the hotel. The boat actually loads and unloads right on the beach in front of the Westin. The boat even has windows on the bottom of the hull for viewing when you reach the snorkeling spots. A video of your trip is available for a fee, around $80 and they will spend extra time with you to get enough footage of you to make it feel worthwhile. The other hotels we had been considering when planning our vacation were down in Wailea. Good thing we didn't go in that direction. We took a quick tour on our way out and there is basically no beach down there. That is the spot during whale season but we were there after the season and the beaches down there are a beautiful lava rock with the crashing waves but not for us because we wanted the beach right at the hotel. Of course, if you want the lush tropical foliage, beautiful golf courses and high end shopping areas, Wailea is for you. The road to Hana. Well, after hearing that it was the must do, we did it. I will say the drive is beautiful, remember, it's the journey, not the destination. I can't tell you how many times we heard that. That being said, I loved it, of course, I was the driver. After my son ended up throwing up in the back seat from car sickness for the first time, I realized this was a tough one. He has been on some pretty seriously curvy rods without trouble in his almost six years in the back seat but this one did him in. It is a trip that must be prepared for and entered into with open eyes. If you go during a time with little rain, the waterfalls will have but a trickle of water coming over but can still be beautiful. At every stop on the road, the parking lots are covered with the broken glass from the car windows that have been broken as people take advantage of the tourists getting out and walking away from their vehicles. Just remember to keep everything out of the front compartments/seats of the car where you can see it. The suction cup marks on the front windshield are also a giveaway that a GPS lives in the car somewhere. I still can't figure out if the road to Hana is a local prank or what. When you tell someone from the area you did it they laugh and only after we did the trip did we see the T-shirts that read \"I Survived the Road to Hana\" that made me feel like I had just completed some crazy feat. I must say that the trip is worth while if you love the outdoors and want to see the natural terrain of the island. It's just not for you if you would rather spend your time on the beach. One final note on this trip, check your rental car CD player before buying the CD guide for the Road to Hana. After I bought the $20 CD at the shell station stand, I tried to stick in my new CD and found that there was already another one in the player. Who knows, you may get a freebie. We did the Old Lahaina Luau and truly enjoyed it. The staff are super friendly and really seem to enjoy their job. They are all joking and super attentive to your needs. The food is good, the bar is open and the view is spectacular. Just book early, it was sold out. I haven't been to any of the other luaus so I can't compare but this one was a good show. The hotel self parking does fill up at night so they will give you free valet but be warned, if you leave your car there the next night too and don't leave, they will charge you the extra $10 for that night. I just told the front desk what happened and they removed the fee from the bill right away. They will offer a time share preview but don't push too hard, just cards under your room door. We took the tour and kids are allowed, even a Gameboy to entertain him during the talk. You can also opt to have them attend the Kid's Club if you want for the morning. Just once we said we were passing, they sort of forgot about us and we just had to walk out after waiting ten minutes to get the exit survey. If you are looking to fill your mini fridge in the room, and I do mean mini, go next door to the Whaler's Village and visit the ABC store. You can get a six pack of beer for the price of one at the pool bar at the hotel. If you want even cheaper, go back toward Lahaina and go to one of the more local stores. We just got lazy and were enjoying our time at the hotel as much as possible and the ABC had pretty much what we needed. The hotel store was our last resort but still had the last minute snacks we wanted and you will pay for that convenience, but hey, we were on vacation. Overall, the Westin will be the hotel of choice for my family in the future and we will definitely be going back as many times as possible.", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing Service & Rooms\u201d", "Author": "ngabbay", "ReviewID": "UR16199525", "Content": "My husband, my baby, and I spent 5 nights at this hotel in May 2008.

The self-parking lot fills up quickly, and regularly results in the valets having to double park cars when it gets full, which can be inconvenient if your car is blocked. the only meal we had at the westin was breakfast at the ono bar and grill poolside, which was good, although almost double the price of the same breakfast we had at the plantation house in kapalua two days later. however, starwood picked up the tab, the setting was beautiful, and the restaurant was very conveniently located at the bottom of the stairs at the end of the promenade outside our room. we also had great happy hour drinks and chips and guac at tropica, with our shaded table facing the ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beachwalk and the ocean. service was very slow, however. for our restaurant choices see reviews here ( http://www.chowhound.com/topics/516516 ). gotta give special recognition to our concierge, sara, who is an endurance athlete with seemingly boundless energy and boundless enthusiasm for maui. she made several very helpful itinerary and restaurant suggestions, which really enhanced our stay. overall, we enjoyed the westin maui a lot, its location at ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali and its well-crafted resort experience being the highlights. we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely consider staying here again, but only in an ocean view room.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clevland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat time @ the Westin Maui\u201d", "Author": "jenqt", "ReviewID": "UR15778014", "Content": "We just returned back from a 10 night stay at the Westin Maui with our two sons, ages 4 and 1. Great time was had by all. We were upgraded to an ocean-front suite upon check-in (we are Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum, so that might be why) and the room on the 11th floor was great. Life saver having a suite with a little one. (FYI, found out via their website before our trip that we could request a diaper pail and a highchair for our room--had always requested cribs but never occured to me that many hotels also offer these items as well. Was fantastic to have them, especially the diaper pail!) Kids LOVED the slides at the pool, my 4 yr old went on the big slide by himself and was able to have Dad or Mom wait for him at the bottom as he's not a great swimmer. 1 yr old loved going on the kiddie slide w/Mom or Dad, but also w/his brother (w/one putting him at the top and other catching him at the bottom!) Pools were all around fantastic, only wish they had some part of the pool that was shallower for the kids (shallowest was 4'.)We never had any problems finding seats at the pool, tho' most the shade covered lounges were taken by 8:30-9AM. This was no different than any other resort hotel we've stayed at, where people save their seats then go for breakfast. Never bothered us. Read some previous reviews before we left about the adult poool being un-monitored. This was not the case while we were there, as I mistakenly took my older son there (wasn't paying attention and really thought the pool adjencent to it was the adult pool, realized after that the \"adults only\" sign was for the walkway UP to the adult pool, not the lower pool nearby) Anyway, we swam quietly for a bit, did get a few looks (Kid-haters! LOL, jk) and a pool waitress politely told us that it was designated for adults. My one beef with the pools is that the kiddie slide needs some refurbishing, both my husband and I got little fiberglass burns/splinters every other time we went down. OUCH! Doesn't bother the kids, but adults have trouble sliding fast (not a lot of water to move you, as is designed for kids) and then you get the splinters. Needs to be re-varnished or something. You do not have this problem on the big slide. Nice being right next to Whaler's Village, went to eat at Hula Grill and Rusty Harpoon, both are nice. Shopping is decent, you konw its a bit pricier, but is so convenient. Went into Lahaina multiple times, ate at Moose McGuillicuddy's (sp?) which was great, the Hard Rock & Bubba Gumps (predictable, but also good), BJ's Chicago Pizza - great!, Kimo's - great! and our FAVORITE (sans kids while they stayed at the hotel w/a babysitter from Happy Kids Maui nanny service) was Ma La. It's on the ocean, on the other side of the Cannery Mall (off Front Street.) People did have kids there, but was definitely better for us to go w/out. I had the ribs which were absolutely delicious. We were also very pleased with the Ono Bar & Grill at the Westin. The food there was pretty good, and bonus for us, the kids meals there were both free (as they were under 5) so it actually was cheaper for us to eat lunch at the hotel. My 4yr old son did the Westin Kids Club one day and he loved it (he's almost 5, which is their age minimum, so we shamefully had him lie about his age. Well worth it.) We did not do the breakfast brunch, but did eat from the Colonnade, where they had cereal, croissants, hot brkfst sandwhiches, etc. We drove to the near by Safeway and got some supplies (milk, oatmeal, snacks, etc.--our suite had a mini fridge) so that helped a bit with the food costs. Hotel room walls are a bit thin, only a problem if you have inconsiderate neighbors who don't follow hotel ettiquette (like ours, who ordered room service, via speaker phone, at 11:30 at night, and shouted to ea other at 5:30 in the AM about who was taking longer to get ready.) For most, it won't be a problem I don't think. Loved Maui, was there about 8 yrs ago pre-kids. Next time I'd love to spend some more time shopping in Pa'ai (start of the road to Hana) a cool little hippy town with very cool shopping and eateries. (w/the kids, we made it 1/2 way to Hana, yay!)

We had shade and did not have to get up early and pretend to setup something before 8am in the morning and worry that someone would take it anyway. We even ended up buying a timeshare we had no intention on buying before we got there so we will see this place again and again and again.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "ebat", "ReviewID": "UR15082525", "Content": "I am finally getting around to writing a review for my Honeymoon this past Sept/Oct (2007). The Westin Maui was everything I could have hoped for...amazing pools, friendly and helpful staff, pristine beach, and delicious food! The staff was so great. They truely waited on us hand and foot. We never experienced any timeshare talk which I was a little nervous for. Maybe we were too young (my husband is 26 and I am 25). I would highly HIGHLY recommend this hotel to honeymooners, couples, families, everyone! We went at a slow time for families so it felt very romantic. I think the Westin's beach is the best in the Ka'anapali strip area. The Hyatt looks like it has a slightly more active pool area, but their beach isn't nearly as nice as the Westin. I also highly recommend renting a cabana on the beach for a day. As a Starwoods Preferened Guest member it was only $40 and it gave us a lot of privacy. The were coming by with water and fresh pineapple all day. I would also recommend that if you are traveling to this hotel that you become a Starwoods Prefered Guest Member. It is free and they have a special floor reserved spefically reserved for Prefered Guests. We were automatically upgraded to a deluxe oceanview room when we got there (reserved a garden view). I'm not sure if this is because we were Honeymooners or because we are Preferred Guests. The pools are so much fun. The slides are for kids and adults alike (my husband really loved the slides). We never had any trouble getting chairs, no matter what time of day we arrived. There is a \"grotto\" contecting a couple of the pool with a hot tub inside. Waterfalls are all over the place. One of the most beautiful pools I've seen. The location is great too. You are literally all a couple of steps from the Whalers Village which has great shopping and food. And it is only a 5-10 min drive to Lahaina with LOTS of amazing restaurants, shopping, the Old Lahaina Luau, and the famous Banyon Tree. The food is very good as well. Every meal we had was delicious. The breakfast buffett is a little pricey (I think it was $25.95) but very good. You have to expect some steep prices in Maui. Overall it was an amazing vacation. If you are visiting Maui you have to eat at Mama's Fish House in Paia and Kimo's in Lahaina. Two of the best meals I've had in my life!.

Travelling was my husband, myself, and our 4 yr old daughter. We've been to Maui several times, usually twice a yr. for the last 8 yrs. We have always stayed in a condo, rather than a hotel, and have always stayed in the Wailea/Kihei area, this time choosing Kaanapali. We're chalking it up to a \"learning experience\"! To make a really long story a little briefer, the hotel is lovely in appearance, seems very clean. The pics posted on the website haven't been \"fixed\", it really is very pretty. The staff, for the most part we're very nice and helpful. We were offered a great room upgrade upon checking in, even though we booked a package deal through an airline, and not with the hotel directly. We paid for a mountain view, and were upgraded to a great Ocean view room on the 7 th. floor. This may have been because my husband mentioned that we're Starwood Preferred Guests, while checking in... not sure. Valet's we're quick and curteous. Unfortunately, on our first night, we learned that the hotel has no insulation/sound proofing. We could literally hear every word our neighbours said, if we didn't have our TV on! I am NOT exaggerating. Maybe it was worse as the room we had, had the door that can make it suite?? Not sure. Thank goodness, they left our 2nd day, and some quieter folks moved in! Although, you could still easily hear the words of people walking down the hall, especially while trying to sleep. If you crave quiet in your room, re-think this one. The buffet breakfast included with our package was really good, huge with everything from omelet station, fresh fish, tons of fruit, meat, cheese, waffles... you name it. We ate at the \"Ono\" restaurant at the hotel 2 evenings, as our daughter was tired and we didn't want to shower and dress for the more upscale restaurant \"Tropica\" (which I've heard good things about). Ono, for dinner was let down both times, could not recommend it. We had dinner at the \"Hula Grill\" one night, next to the hotel, good food, nice atmosphere, but make reservations! Shopping.... I love to shop on Maui, but NOT at Whaler's village! Wow, what a big rip-off! some of the chain stores like Roxy, Coach... we're the same as other locations, but the vendors were crazy!! I found some items to be triple the price or more, than some of the markets down in Kihei! Even most of the shops in Lahaina are much better priced... If you're looking for more mainstream shopping head up to Kahalui (near airport), for Macy's, and a great little mall with it. By all means, get out of the Resort!!! If you've never been to Maui before, you will not find a whole lot of \"Aloha\" at the resort. I think that's what made us feel like we made the wrong decision by staying here, felt like we may as well be in Vegas, with a pretty beach! Oh, the pool is great, huge, just like in the pics, water slides, fun for kids. I still can't believe how many people are out at the pool at 6 or 7 am reserving lounges! This is not for us. Give us Makena beach....Ulua beach, with a funky little condo with a view any day. It would also have cost us about half as much money. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to bash the Westin, we are actually big fans of Westin properties. We love Mission Hills in Palm Springs... Westin Whistler in BC... Over all I'd have to say the \"resort\" experience is just not for us. So many little fees... daily resort fee $20, tipping valet on every outing...(oh try to self-park, very close and then you don't pay).

The open air lobby was amazing with a lagoon/waterfall backdrop. The pond was stocked with coy, black-white swans, flamingos, parrots, and cockatoo. The front desk personnel warmly greeted us and promptly checked us in. She asked what the occasion was for our visit. After replying that we were getting married on the island, she upgraded us to an ocean view room at no charge. View was amazing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6sunset, Lanai, whales, beach, pool area. The staff everywhere was extremely friendly and helpful. Poolside bartenders poured nice cocktails. Their wedding staff actually helped us with the planning of our wedding even though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go through them! The room itself was really nice. Heavenly Bed and Shower was next best thing to being at home. Never turned on the Plasma tv that was hanging on the wall. Free wireless internet provided a strong signal for my IPhone even poolside. The many pools and water falls provided a sanctuary to bask in the sweet Hawaiian sun. Beachfront was among the best we found on the Island for laying out and swimming. If you are into snorkeling, be sure to explore this area (esp. towards Black Rock, turtles and many fish). Even though we were towards the end of whale season, we saw whales just off shore many times during our 8 day stay. After exploring the Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali strip, we both felt that the Westin was the best place on it. Resort fee of $20 a day includes self parking, two bottles of spring water a day, access to gym, plus more. Seeing that bottled water and parking costs are incurred in most places on the island, this fee wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad. We only ate at the hotel one time. This was breakfast at Tropica, and though it was one of the best cups of coffee and omelets I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was worth $40. (Buffet was $25pp, and may have been more worth it). Overall, I was very pleased with this resort and would recommend to anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6kids or no kids, newlyweds, older couples, singles. Negatives: These negatives are just an FYI. They have not affected our plans to stay there in the future. Everyone reserves pool chairs even though there are signs saying you cannot, and staff will take your stuff and store it if it is left for more than 30 minutes. My advice is to reserve early and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave for a long time if you plan on staying poolside for the day. Our cleaning lady was annoying. Being 6 hrs different from Detroit time, we went to bed fairly early (by 11) and woke up extremely early (usually by 5am at latest). So, our days started pretty early. The cleaning lady hit our room at the end of the afternoon, when we would be coming back from our day and wanted to get ready for the eve. She wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t switch our cleaning to earlier, and we actually just asked her not to clean a couple days so we could use the room. All she cared about was cleaning our room, and not whether we were happy. The last day, after checking out just before noon, I made multiple trips carrying luggage to our Jeep. After my first trip down, I returned to my room to find the door propped wide open by the cleaning lady (who was in the next room) and my luggage unsecured in plain view. I closed the door for this next trip down and she again propped it open. Made me feel like I was no longer a guest there, and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t important. This was reflected in my hotel survey. Self-Parking is part of your daily resort fee. Parking lot is right next to hotel, which is good. Bad thing is, the hotel sells spots to outside parkers during the day, which causes the lot to be full to hotel guests. This happened numerous times daily. Hotels fix for this was free valet, which I would have gotten my car faster if I self parked. There are 7 pools at this hotel. One is designated as an adult pool. This was never enforced, and it made it difficult if you wanted to get a good afternoon nap in the sun with the numerous kids running thru the area. The thought was nice though. April 2008 MAUI VACATION SYNOPSIS Thursday Arrival at OGG airport. Car rental desk (where we rented a Jeep) was close and very quick. (Get your car rental out of the way while everyone else is waiting for the bags to come. You will have keys in hand before your bags hit the carousel. Drive to Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. Checked into the Westin (see above) www.westinmaui.com/index.htm We had dinner in Lahaina at the Lahaina Fish Company. Food was good, view was exceptional. Drinks were very weak and not worth half the price the cost. We watched the sunset on the seawall of Front St in front of Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (where I proposed). If you want a view of the sunset, unimpeded from the island of Lanai, you need to travel to Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali or north of that. Friday We went shopping at Foodland for non-perishable grocries for the week. This was a relax day, poolside at the Westin. If you want to reserve a set of chairs and umbrella ($25/day), go to the towel desk at 8am when they open. Poolside and beach were great. Had dinner in Lahaina at Moose McGillacutty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Good place for pub style food. Saturday Woke up at 330am and drove to Haleakala Crater. www.haleakala.national-park.com Trip took us 1.5 hrs from Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali. Sunrise was at 617am\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Amazing! Totally worth the winding road that seemed forever. We went right to the summit and then stopped at viewpoints on the way down. We would have like to come earlier to see the area in pitch darkness so we could have seen the stars (light began to show around 0500). There a few telescopes just west of the summit at Science City (closed to public). The drive down was better than up because we were able to see our surroundings. It was amazing to see the change from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Crater, to forest, then to beach. Oh, and on that note, the change from 38degrees and 30mph winds to 80degrees (dress warm). On the way down we stopped at Kula Lodge to have breakfast. www.kulalodge.com/restaurant_lodge.htm The food was exceptional. I had corned beef hash, potatoes and toast (homemade jams with Hawaiian fruit) and my Fianc\u00c3\u00a9e had the banana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foster pancakes (WOW!). A must stop on the way down. We were glad we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the bike ride down cause we were on our own schedule and were able to stop and eat there. At night went to the Old Lahaina Luau. www.oldlahainaluau.com/index_main.html Food was very good, same as all Luaus. I feel that all Luaus are too commercialized and only went so my Fianc\u00c3\u00a9e could experience one. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that this particular one was worth paying more for. See vendors in downtown Lahaina for super discounted rates on Luaus. Sunday Breakfast at Westin Tropica. Expensive, go for the buffet, more choices for the price.Relax day by the pool. Got married at Kapalua Bay. It was so nice. Beautiful area with Lanai, Molokai, and the sunset as the backdrop. Had our wedding dinner at I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122o in Lahaina. Food was really worth it. Monday Lanai Wild Dolphin Snorkeling tour with the Pacific Whale Foundation. www.pacificwhale.org/ The staff was very knowledgeable, biology college students. A very Eco Friendly tour with Biocompostible cups and reef safe sunblock (30)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they provided. We saw many whales breach the water on the way to and from Lanai. Saw about 50 Spinner Dolphins. I have been to Mexico, Virgin Islands, South Carib, Bahamas, Grand Cayman, the Big Island Hawaii, and Jamaica snorkeling. The two reef spots they chose fell at the bottom of my list of places I have been. Hardly any fish or turtles. I suggest taking a trip to Molokini to snorkel and a separate trip if you want to see the dolphins and whales. (NOTE: there are many great snorkel places from Kapalua all the way down to Makena that are easy to access and free if you do your research). We ordered room service after the long day in the sun. Tuesday Drove North from Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali on Hywy 30, 36, 38, and 340. Not a popular trip, but it was relatively short (compared to Hana) and definitely worth the view. Feel of coastal California hywy. We stopped in a village about half way and bought some Banana Bread and Coconut from a nice lady that sells the stuff from her house. Her house is the first sign when traveling from the West. Short drive down her driveway, she welcomed us happily and even allowed us to view the ocean from her back yard (her idea). From there we headed towards Wailuku. Had lunch at a place called Main Street Bistro. The food was outstanding!!! Just down the road from the entrance to the Iao Valley. Park and parking is free. Valley was surrounded by huge walls of green vegetation. Two streams met at the park and provide great photo ops. If you walk up to the Needle Lookout point, take the trail behind it up. This hike is for those in somewhat good shape. It takes you up so you can see the backside of the needle, where you can actually see waterfalls that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see from the lookout point. Be careful though, most of the trail is cut cliff side, and though there is vegetation next to the trail, it is a long way down if you fell! After all that, there was still time to chill by the pool (trip took from 7am-2pm). We had dinner at Front Street Bar and Grille. Ribs were top notch. Wednesday Road to Hana at 7am. If you have two people, have one drive there and one drive back. There is no error for driving mistakes while driving the twists and turns of the road. Getting the Road to Hana CD was worth it (we got it thru the Expedia Travel Expert office in Lahaina (on the Honoapalini Hywy). They had great deals on tours. See Lisa, she was so helpful! (Tell her the Fireman from Michigan sent ya). After exploring Hana, we stopped at a home selling BBQ roadside (just after Hana, on the left, on the way to Hamoa. Honestly some of the best food we ate on Maui. We both had the Mahi Mahi with fresh veggies and rice, and were stuffed after. This guy works for Hana Fire Dept too. It is quite the ride to the Seven Pools and Waterfalls, but worth it. NOTE: Travel to the Crater and Pools within 3 days of each other and you can use the same park pass. We ate dinner for my Wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Birthday at Pacific O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Food was great, view was great, service not so good. Thursday Last day, 1040pm flight. Westin couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow us to checkout late, but did offer their hospitality room for 30 minutes so we could shower and change before leaving. So, we spent the last day by the pool and snorkeling along the beaches of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali. After packing up, we went to Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fish House (www.mamasfishhouse.com) for dinner before our flight. We arrived an hour early and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get seated early (definitely make reservations). They did seat us at exactly our reservation time though. I was very impressed with their style of waiting for a table. The ocean front property was perfect, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and atmosphere amazing, and the food was the best we had all week and definitely worth the price. I had the Pua Me Hua Hana \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In the style of Old Hawaii \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ono and Opah saut\u00c3\u00a9ed in coconut milk, with slow-cooked Kalua pig, grilled banana, Molokai sweet potato, Island fruit and a fresh coconut and my Wife had the Mahimahi caught by Jeff Holland along the north shore of Maui \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Stuffed with lobster, crab, Maui onion and baked in a macadamia nut crust. Dessert was Banana Macadamia Nut Crisp served warm with Tahitian vanilla ice cream and also a cup of Kona Coffee ice cream.

First of all, when we arrived, the bellmen were quick and very helpful getting our luggage and parking our rental jeep. As we walked into the lobby, we were greeted with the friendly aloha spirit and a fresh flower lei. Check in was super fast and easy! Actually it was a great start to our stay there, we were given a free gift (Box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts, Mmm!). Our room was breathtaking! Looked very luxurious and classy! The kitchen area had a mini fridge with freezer, cupboard space, coffee maker (With free Kona coffee that gets replenished everyday). Same deal with the bottled water. There was also an ice machine on our floor, and each room (I beleive) has a little ice bucket. Beds were really cushy, the blankets were divine! They dont call them, \"Heavenly Beds\" for nothing! There must have been atleast 3 different covers on.. very convienient for everyone because you can chose your own comfort and take off some, or sleep with all them on top (Although it did get hot in the night) we usually ended up sleeping with just one. The TV was HUGE! There was free internet hook up for our laptop. Lots of desk area to put our luggage on. The lanai was awesome, we used it quite a bit during our stay. We had an ocean view, and overlooked the pools, so it was nice to sit and have lunch outside on the deck. Beware not to lock yourself out there though! We heard some yells from our neighbors who had done just that Haha, funny for us, not for them! I must mention the bathroom... AMAZING! The showerhead was also huge and felt soooo good! Like a massage! Theres even a cupboard with ironing board in the bathroom too. In the room, is a large closet, with 2 robes inside for you to wear during your stay. Nice touch. There are a couple stores in the lobby, one is like an ABC but more expensive. The other has clothing + misc. items. The Westin is located next to Whalers Village, where you can find an ABC store.. worth it to just walk over and stock up on food items and drinks. The pools at The Westin are by far the nicest! The water was a tad bit chilly, but you get used to it after a minute or two. The adult only pool was usually only occupied by a couple people, so it was nice to be able to swim around. The hot tub was great! Especially in the rain! It was usually pretty full at night time after dinner. The bar located right by the hot tub makes excellent drinks, I reccomend the Lava Flow! Pricey, but you have to spoil yourself once in a while, you're in Maui! Another thing about the pools.. lots of lounge chairs, but you should find one in the morning because they are full in the afternoon. There is a towel hut for extra towels, and a cute little shop that sells bathing suits and some clothing. Check out the grotto too, located inbetween the waterfalls! Never did go on the waterslide but it looked like lots of fun. The restaurants had great menus, and while we didnt eat at any, there were lots of people in them, so they must have been delicious. Room service was WAY overpriced.. something like $20 for eggs, and bagel.. not worth it. We drove to the grocery store and got groceries, definetly saved money this way. Pay phones were in the lobby, always available, and had a nice cushy bench to sit on while using them. We were spoiled while at the Westin, but found that people were a lot friendlier in Oahu. Staff was good here, but nothing to write home about. Also found this to be the case outside the resort, at the malls, gas stations.. people just werent as cheery.. maybe it was the weather? (Rained HARD for most of our stay, caused road closures, and radio advisories to stay indoors). All in all, a good stay, but I probably wouldnt spend that much money on staying here again. If you have money to burn, Id reccommend the Westin, as it had the most beautiful grounds of all the hotels, nicest pools, and a great location. Just a couple minute walk down the beach, is Black Rock.. a great place to snorkle.

One can easily hear nearby hallway doors close, as well as when the guests in the room next door flush their toilet or take a shower - not outrageously loud but you can hear it. You can also hear the guests above you when they move their patio furniture around. Not a lot of thought went into acoustical engineering in this building. The restaurants were ok - but there is no \"fine dining\" venue that you might find at the Hyatt or Ritz-Carlton hotels. Lots of pools - and every one filled with lots of very young kids. There is an \"adult only\" pool, but filled with kids. There was absolutely no enforcement by Westin regarding the adult only venue. The pool wait staff was absolutely worthless. I could go on and on about this but the bottom line was that if you wanted something at the pool you had better get it yourself at one of the restaurants or bars. Location - absolutely fabulous! Literally right next to Whaler's Village where there are two great restaurants, Leilani's and the Hula Grill. Nothing elaborate but good food and service. Do NOT go to the Rusty Harpoon there - bad food and equally bad service. Great beach walking at the Westin. There is, of course, the beach and also a cement pathway that winds parallel to the beach from the Sheraton in the north to the Hyatt in the south end. Perfect for walkers and runners. So to summarize - if you are looking for a boutique hotel experience with a fine dining venue and a romantic peace and quiet experience - the Westin Maui is not for you.

We stayed 4 nights in Oahu and 9 nights at this hotel in Maui. The experience was excellent. When I booked with the travel agent, they informed the hotel that we were honeymooners. We got a welcome package that included free buffet breakfast every morning, a box of chocolates, postcards and best of all, a 50 minute couples cabana massage at their heavenly spa. That was wonderful. In terms of the resort itself, we had an oceanview room in the ocean towers and the view was breathtaking. Each room had a balcony and you could see the beautiful beach, ocean and all of the resort's pools. The other tower, the beach tower would have had a side view of the ocean. The pools were soo much fun that we felt like little kids. They had waterslides, watersports and poolside bars. They also had 2 jacuzzis that were open until 10 pm. There were a lot of families there with kids but they have an \"adults only\" pool area that was more quiet and relaxing, but the kids pool was more fun because of the waterslides and waterfalls. The hotel is in an ideal location, right on Kaanapaali beach. The hotel provides umbrellas and chairs on the beach for $25 but if you want an umbrella, you need to get there by like 9:00 AM. We were there for a while and at the beginning of our stay the hotel was not that full and we were able to get chairs on the beach and the pool. But towards Valentine's day weekend, it got really busy and people would save their pool chairs before they were to eat breakfast, which was annoying but still not that bad. I don't think I really have anything bad to say about the hotel, my experience was great and the restaurant, Tropica was really good and very romantic. The are also right next to the Whalers Village, maybe a 2 minute walk, at most, where there is great shopping and a few great restaurants. Also, it is only about a 5 - 10 minute drive to Lahania with great shopping and restaurants as well. Also, in the hotels's other restaurant by the pool, they have live nightly music, but most of the restaurants on the island have that as well. All in all, it is a great resort with great amenities, beautiful views and nice people.

We had just come from the fabulous Moana Surfrider on Oahu after 9 days of bliss. The drive from the airport was so fantastic and when I yelled out after seeing 3 whales jumping out of the water, my husband almost smashed into another car. The hotel was so beautiful as we approached and we were greeted with drinks and lei's. Check in was quick and when I asked why so low a floor, I was told they were full. Our room was spacious, clean. The view from the balcony was maybe a 4 foot swatch of the beach with the parking lot the main view. Not one to make trouble, we slept and woke up to smelly, noisy garbage trucks in the parking lot. We went to the front desk and a lovely Japanese girl at the desk told us she was sorry and would try to get us on a higher floor with a better view. She tapped on her computer for a time and said she would put us on the 7th floor with a pool, beach view. Since I had paid well over 600 a night...This was acceptable. She told us to come back between 3 and 4 for a room change...We went to repack our suitcases in room 325. When we returned from exploring this magnificent island, we were told we had been moved to room 326 from a not so nice male staff member. I was so angry. You moved us across the hall. We packed and unpacked to be moved across the hall. Only room available, I was told. I asked to speak to the Japanese girl and was told she was with a client and was unavailable. I kept telling him, I was promised a hgher level room to no avail. I gave up. When opening room 326, it was dirty with smoke stained mirrors and glass doors. The smell was disgusting. We look over our balcony and guess what, we see a mostly a roof with a little ocean and pool. Now I am furious so down to the desk again and of course the Japanese girl denies that she promised a higher floor for us so I ask for a manager and after 45 minutes of waiting, I am told both are busy and cannot see us. Totally discouraged, we went to our room changed and went into the magnificent pacific ocean....Upon returning to the room a message was left by the manager, Jeff. I paged him as he asked. I asked him if he would come to our room. He did and was wonderful. He listened to our story. I was visibly upset since I paid top dollar to be treated so rudely. This was our 40th anniversary and our first time to Hawaii so I spared no expense. He said he would work on it and did agree the room smelled horrible....We don't smoke. Within15 minutes we were told by Jeff that he had a beautiful room for us in fact he had 3 different rooms we could view. HUM.....We are ful is what I was told at first. I told Jeff how grateful I was and we moved into the next new room which was so fabulous. Jeff was the niciest person and I thank him but how could the front desk have treated us so badly when Jeff found a beautiful view room. They kept saying they were full...Well that really wasn't my problem. I booked this trip 6 months ago. I had. joined the Starwood program but I am not sure, I will ever stay at a Westin again.

We stayed in room 678 a Premium Deluxe Ocean View Room in the Beach Tower. This was our second trip to Kaanapali beach and our first stay at the Westin. Our check in went very smooth. We pulled up in our rental car, and the bellmen just about had the car unloaded before we could even get out of the car. We were greeted with leis and headed to the front desk. Jeff at the desk was very helpful. He quickly provided us with our room keys and a quick overview. Then we went to our room which was exactly what we booked. About 2 minutes later the bellman arrived with our luggage. The wine and flowers I had prearranged with Ally, one of the great concierges, were there as ordered. There were a few minor things such as the lack of robes and bottled water. But a quick call to the front desk and all was taken care of. Our room was great. I had read reviews the rooms were small, but we had no complaints. I guess if you were trying to squeeze a family of 4 or 5 in, I could see how it might be tough. For 2 it was just perfect. I would suggest 2 adjoining rooms for a family with an extended stay. We could have done with another drawer in the dresser, but other than that it was just right. The bed was very comfortable as advertised (Heavenly Bed). The flat screen TV was nice too. But most of the programming was up-converted 4:3 instead of actual 16:9 HD. No big deal unless your a true tech geek who came to Maui to watch TV. The room was clean. Perhaps not the cleanest hotel room I've been in but certainly not dirty. The view was great. With the hotel provided binoculars we could whale watch right from our balcony. The bathroom was more than adequate and fairly sizable, but it wasn't the most luxurious hotel bathroom we have ever seen. That award might have to go to Bellagio in Vegas. The pool was nice as well. Some of the best chairs do get taken early in the morning, but you could find a chair somewhere at anytime. The wildlife in the lobby pond/waterfall area were fun to watch as well. Our booking included vouchers for the buffet breakfast at Ono every morning. The food was pretty good as far as breakfast buffets go. The omelet/egg station was very good. I'm not sure we would have eaten here for $29 if it was not included. If we did we probably would have ordered off the menu. The food/beverage service pool-side was very good. The waitresses were attentive. The food and drinks were a little pricey. But keep in mind you are enjoying them at one of the best pools on Maui while looking at one of the most beautiful ocean views in the world. I would recommend using the valet if you have a car. It was quite convenient. When you are getting ready to walk out the door for the evening. Simply press the service express button, tell them your claim number, and your car will be there by the time you get to the front door. The $10/day valet fee was well worth it. Somedays they do not charge; if self park is full valet is free. Check out went just as smoothly as check in. We called down for a bellman and to have the valet bring the car around. The bellman came up in about 10 minutes. When we got down front our car was waiting. The bellman helped us load it up and we were on our way. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Westin. We would definitely consider staying here again if we return to the area.

In general, the hotel is on par for Westin, meaning the rooms are quite nice, modern, very clean, and the staff is great and very acomodating. Overall, our experience was way above average bordering on Excellent. The only minor things we personally did not care for, were the sheer number of people always crowding the pool area, which at times made us feel like we were on a cruise ship. This was our fault, as the hotel does not purport to be a small boutique hotel. In spite of this, the amount of activity was probably perfect for teenagers. The other compaints were that the beach was seperated from the pool area, and that the room layouts were somewhat small (as the building is older), and as we found throughout Hawaii, the food was very expensive.

The fountain especially is breathtaking. (I wouldn't get too closed to the flamingos though :/) - Beautiful pools. - Excellent customer service. Everyone was very nice and very accommodating. - Very comfortable \"heavenly\" bed - We were upgraded upon arrival, which was a very nice surprise. - Excellent drinks. We lounged around the pools the whole time we were there and were not disappointed by their drink selections - Location was convenient. We were closed enough to drive to Lahaina town. We walked to Whaler Village Mall, that's literaly next to the hotel - The restaurant/bar by the pool had free nightly shows. - You can sign up to a lot of different activities, especially for children, if that's important. Things that can be improved: - Again, the rate we got was part of their timeshare promotional, therefore, we were hounded by the timeshare lady as soon as we checked in. We just walked into our room, and our phone had started ringing. She informed us to stop by her desk for a $ 75 gift certificate that we could use towards anything at the resort. We told her we would stop by when we had a chance. Well, she called and called and called and called, and left at least two messages each day. She even dropped by our room a few times and left notes. Even though we knew what we were getting into before we booked this trip, this was still very annoying. My husband finally went to pick up this gift card she kept on referring to in her messages. Maybe we were just lucky, but she wasn't working then, and another lady gave us the gift card without giving us the sales pitch. We used the gift card towards our drinks :) - The room itself was very small. We couldn't have both of our suitcases out in the room. We had to take turn opening our suitcases, which was a real pain. - We had couple massage at the spa. While we were happy with our massages, I was a little disappointed by the facility. The woman side, at least, was very small. The whirlpool was also very small. I've been to a lot of spas, so perhaps I'm just a bit spoiled?? By the time we were done with our massages, we had about an hour and half left before closing and was told by our therapists to take our time and . I wasn't the only one left, but I sure felt like I was being rushed out. There was no drinking water left, for instance. The lady that was cleaning kept on walking back and forth and as she walked by, she'd look at her watch. I felt bad about staying in there, so I ended up rushing.

Our friends went there on a package to see the timeshare, but we booked our room for $335 per night. After taxes and fees it was almost $400. Upon check-in, the staff said that we requested adjoining rooms. I said that we did not need adjoing room but wanted to be on the same floor. He replied that we were on the 10th floor and they were on the 3rd. ADJOINING ROOMS??? After screwing around for 15-20 20 minutes, he said we had a better level room and the only thing he could do was switch our friends from a king bed to 2 double beds. I don't know how that had anything to do with getting on the same floor. While the grounds and the pools were excellent, the rooms were small and outdated. The furniture was good quality but the room was so small the table was pushed up against the TV credenza and there was no place to store the luggage. The toilet seat wouls not stay up, so as a man, going to the bathroom was a real challenge. The next day I talked to a woman manager at the front desk and told her we were very disappointed in the size of the room, the toilet seat problem, and how this room is not what should be expected of a Westin. She repeated that our Mountain view room was a better level room than our friends. I told her that our friends have a full view of the ocean from their room. She instisted they didn't even though we saw it for ourselves. I told her I would be willing to downgrade to a worse level room if it meant we had an ocean view. She offered a $100 total discount on our stay and said the toilet seat would be fixed. No one came to fix the toilet seat and by the 4th day of our stay I finally contaced a property manager.

Overall I would highly recommend the Westin. The Grounds: With five pools (one with a waterslide and one that promised to be kid free--although they didn't kick out kids), and a lobby full of coy ponds, flamingos and birds, the Westin boasts beautiful grounds. Though the exterior of the building seemed a bit dated, the rest of the Westin was gorgeous. We spent many relaxing days just swimming in the many pools, and playing on the waterslide. We met a lot of really nice people hanging out on the grounds, everyone was very friendly. There was often live entertainment signing in the outside grounds, and one night, they even had a fire dancer performing by the adult pool. Even better, the Westin is centrally located, and is right next door to Whaler's Village (where you can do some serious shopping and browsing), and it also is walking distance to Black Rock (a great snorkeling location) (although not as close as the Sheraton). The location alone is worth the stay. Also, from the adult pool, you have a prime view of the sunset! We had a great time just relaxing on the grounds of the hotel, and on the beach right in front of the hotel. Though the beach proved fun during the day, at night, it was empty and we felt like we had the whole beach to ourselves. The Rooms: The big draw for us was the Heavenly Bed (we have one at home)...and shower (we own the shower head as well) and it was Heavenly! The room was very tastefully decorated. A lot of people complain that the rooms are small...and while they aren't large...they were spacious enough for us. It was also nice to have a small fridge in the room, as we were able to take advantage of the ABC store (a store that carries an intersting variety of items including food--at relatively inexpensive prices) in Whaler's Village, so that we had lots of drinks and snacks on hand. Another random perk: every room comes equiped with binoculars...which came in handy throughout our trip. We read many reviews that the Westin often upgrades guest rooms, and we too were upgraded from a garden view to a mountain view for the first night of our stay. The mountain view was breathtaking. Although, I would caution, that mountain view on lower floors would have been a view of the parking lot. For the rest of our stay we moved to an ocean view room (see explanation below), and it was gorgeous; although, in hindsight, I would have kept the mountain view, as both were gorgeous--but there was a large price difference. The Restaurants: The Westin's restaurants are not that great. However, because of the location, you can easily walk to the restaurants in Whaler's Village, or take a quick car ride down to Lahaina for some great places (I highly recommend Pacifico's in Lahaina--the tasting menu is a must! and worth every penny!!!). The bar however was great! All the bartenders were very friendly...and I highly recommend the \"lava flow.\" The Spa: We had a pleasant experience at the spa, and had relaxing treatments. The only complaint I had was that the quiet room/waiting room was a bit loud (and not that relaxing)--and surprisingly the staff played a part in the volume. However, they did have amazing dry fruit and tea and water selections, and the treatment itself was pure heaven. Romantic Weekend With Twin Beds: While we had a wonderful time, and I would highly recommend this hotel, the biggest downside for us was that when we arrived at the hotel, they were unable to accommodate our request for a king size bed. We had specifically requested a king size bed, but apparently the Westin does not \"guarantee\" that you will get the room you reserved. As the trip served as a delayed honeymoon for us, we were very disappointed to receive a room with twin beds. They were able to move us to a different room the second day, but, we had to choose between moving to a room with a view of the parking lot, or an ocean view (adding $200 plus per night to our stay). It was also inconvenient to have to wait in our room so we could be there when they were ready to move us, and then take the time to move to a different room--when we just wanted to enjoy Maui and get our vacation started. I also think they should have discounted the upgrade given the bed situation. However--they apparently have this problem a lot, as every time we walked by the lobby, we heard a couple arguing at the check in counter \"what do you mean you don't have any king beds.\" It started to get comical by the end of our stay. It may have been the time of year (since we went in late September and kids are back in school--there were more couples than families). Smokers Beware/Non-Smokers Rejoice: If you do not like being around smokers, you will love the smoke free policy at the Westin--there is no smoking anywhere on the grounds of the Westin--not inside or outside. If, however, you are a smoker, beware that in addition to not being able to smoke anywhere outside, if you are caught smoking in your room (which includes your balcony), there is a hefty fine--though I am not sure whether this was just meant as a scare tactic or whether they actually enfoce this policy. Though you can't smoke by the pool, there is a smoking section right on the beach that isn't far away.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ramon, CA", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "Lege", "ReviewID": "UR13343367", "Content": "Beautiful lobby and pool area.

Location was everything for this resort, we went over to Whalers Village (right next door) or to Lahina (2-3 stoplights away) for lunch and dinner pretty much every day. A rental car is definitely recommended - allowed us to save a lot of money by not eating at the resort for every meal. The weather wasn't great during our week's stay, so we decided to do the Westin Villa Tour one day instead of sitting in our room waiting for the rain to stop. It took longer than the 90 minutes they say, but it was interesting. Plus, we received $100 off our bill plus 50% off our next stay at a Starwood property. That was definitely worth it! All in all, we would definitely recommend this hotel. Great location, great atmosphere, great pools (my husband spent more time in the kids pool sliding down the waterslides than the adult pool) and a great deal. Maui was beautiful and this hotel is a great place to stay.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Sleep But Far From Heaven\u201d", "Author": "part_time_beach_bum", "ReviewID": "UR13157861", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin three nights as part of a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding. Overall it was a fine experience and worth the rate we paid ($199 per night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c local rate) for a mountain view room but we felt that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the rack rate in the $400\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or even the offered discounted rate in the mid $300\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s per night. We probably would stay there again at $200 a night but would not for a higher rate because although the hotel was very nice, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that it was incredibly special or unique. First the good. The hotel location was convenient, minutes from Lahaina and next door to Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village. The self park lot was close to the hotel entrance unlike some other resorts. The rooms were perfectly large for the two of us with a very comfortable king sized bed with high thread count sheets and down comforter (the Westin signature Heavenly Bed). The balcony was actually roomy for two and the room features were quite nice: flat screen tv, plenty of cabinet space (no closets though), separate table and working desk. There was a kiosk in the lobby that allowed you to check in and print boarding passes on all major airlines including the inter-island flights. We enjoyed the vast pool area as well as the quick access to the beach. My wife really enjoyed her spa and salon treatments and I though the spa facilitates were excellent with a nice coed waiting area overlooking the ocean and nice amenities in the locker rooms. We only tried Ono restaurant for breakfast which was very good but maybe slightly overpriced for the buffet breakfast. The various ducks, swans, koi and other animals were pleasant and we saw plenty of kids (and adults) enjoy feeding or watching them. The timeshare people were decidedly low key; we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get hit up once even when we asked what the starting price was out of curiosity. The so-so: As others have commented, the bathrooms were smaller but adequate. The provided bath products seemed pretty generic and not really a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heavenly Bath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but we had our own products and the plush towels and robes were nice. Our room seemed a little worn in places such as the carpet by the door (the door was so low that it stayed open without a door stopper), one of the chairs was stained and worn, and the table scratched and chipped. Most of this seemed minor and mostly just wear and tear. The staff was sometimes a little varied; mostly very good, professional and friendly (the cleaning, spa/salon, restaurant, and most of the front desk staff). Sometimes we found some staff (bartenders, banquet and even concierge staff) to be indifferent or even surly. We are pretty low key, non-drinking, few requests sort of people so we found it very surprising because we really weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ugly tourists. In addition, we had a mountain view which included the trash receptacles below our balcony and quite a bit of parking lot noise. We understand from others this was way better than the waterfall noise that other rooms had or even the loud ocean waves that ocean front rooms had. The air conditioning was strangely not very cooling even when we lowered the settings. And of course, the not so impressive: One pet peeve I have is that hotels brag about their flat panel tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but run then an analog signal to them so that the actual picture quality is not very good, much less high definition. To be fair, the hotel never says they have high definition tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but I think most people think flat screen or flat panel necessarily mean high definition digital tv. On a more relevant note, we found some areas of the hotel to be strangely lacking for a high end hotel. For example, the fitness machines had quite a bit of rust on them. The bathroom ventilation grill had black mold on it. The small older refrigerator didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut properly so it never really cooled our bottle of water or anything else. Again this was mostly more of an annoyance than anything serious. We thought the resort fee at this particular resort was unreasonable. We used few of the offered items, e.g. shuttle service, free photograph, high speed internet connection and shopping bag. The self park was a good except that for two of our three nights, the self park was full and we had to use the valet. We thought the banquet food was pretty mediocre even for usual rubber chicken meal. The other issue was that it was fairly expensive even by high end hotel standards. Bottled water was $5 at the bar, we were charged $12 for a lava flow, both of which might have been a mistake but the breakfast buffet was $25. Some of it was worth the spurge but a lava flow is not a glass of champagne and that was too much for a small bottle of non branded water. As you can see, there really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much really wrong with the hotel. The Westin was nice, the beds were comfortable and people for the most part were friendly and professional. It just seemed overpriced compared to other Westin resorts or high end resorts for what you actually got. I think we would definitely stay there again at the price we paid but definitely not for a higher price. There are a lot of other choices in the area which might be better values.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property that lacks ALOHA spirit from the staff\u201d", "Author": "buffalorx95", "ReviewID": "UR13083230", "Content": "Ok, before you judge my review you must know 2 important facts about me as a traveller. I travel 40-45 nights per year on both business and personal travel. Typically I stay at properties such as Hyatt, Hilton, Mariott, and Westin. Pros- The Hotel property is situated on the beautiful portion of the Kaanapali beach where the water is clear . I mention this because we also stayed at the Hyatt just down the beach and the water there was disappointingly murky (service was impeccable and much more ALOHA at the Hyatt- more on that later). Loved the fact that the Whalers Village (restaurants, shops, and convenience store) is right next door to the Westin. Literally, a 3 minute walk... which is nice if you are on a budget, which we were not but are prudent with our choices. Location again was a key turn on as the famous \"Black Rock\" snorkeling area is a short walk away. We saw sea turles, puffer fish, yellow tangs, etc...This was my favorite spot to snorkel.The pool has a fun water slide for the kids, and the atrium has flamingos and swans. Bottom line, the atmosphere and grounds make it a top choice for hotel selection based on LOCATION ALONE!!! Cons- Frankly this was a place that I felt lacked the ALOHA spirit of Hawaii. The employees seemed uninterested in service. This was apparent from check in throughout the 5 nights of lunch/dinner service, pool area, concierges, etc, If you are a discerning traveller that pays for and expects a higher level of service, DON'T, not at the Westin Maui. I guess I expect high level service from a hotel that I pay $500 a night. While this absolutely did not ruin our trip (how could you when you are in Hawaii), I found a few things peculiar. When we entered for check-in nobody greeted us with our welcome leis. This is standard for all guests checking in. Perhaps it was because we were a family of 4 with kids??? We later requested this service as we were departing and got a \"put off\" type attitude from the greeting person at the front. But, I just had just dropped over $3000 for the 5 nights stay, so I suppose two ~ $10-15 floral leis for my boys should not have been a big deal :) It took 3 hours and 2 phone calls to the luggage stand to get our bags (the kids needed swim suits to go swimming). This was after tipping the baggage handler $10 for 4 bags...perhaps I should have done $20 since this is Hawaii? At our first meal at the ONO Grill (Kids eat free but pretty limited menu for kids), the waitress ditched us halfway through the meal. I suppose it had been a long day so I understand she may have wanted to go home. Another gentleman helped serve us, cleaned up, and dropped the check. I hope the 25% gratuity I left stayed in his pocket and not the young lady that was so recalcitrant earlier toward us. Beach towel hut personnel were a bit short with our kids when geting towels, but just make sure you get towels for the family. No big deal. Bottom Line: We loved Maui and our experiences from the different places we toured and visited had the ALOHO spirit Hawaii is famous for. Westin clearly remains on the lower rung of service excellence among the Big 4 (Hyatt, Mariott, Hilton, Westin). There just is no ALOHA at the Westin Maui. All of these are little things but lower your expectations if you stay there or have been pampered by the Hyatt, Hilton, and/or Mariott", "Date": "January 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crewe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLoved the view\u201d", "Author": "Wesi1910", "ReviewID": "UR13071296", "Content": "My husband was attending a conference at this hotel and I was lucky enough to be invited to come along. We had a room with full ocean view and enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the morning, watching the whales near the shore! The walls are indeed a bit thin and if you have a room with an adjoining door it can get quite noisy. The service we received was very good - the one downside was the housekeeping which pestered me one day. As I was ill I hung the do-not-disturb-sign out but was still called twice, even though during the first conversation we agreed for the next day. We enjoyed the excellent breakfast buffet and meals at the ONO bar. The Tropicana bar also opens for breakfast during busy weekends. What bugged me was the attempt to sell the time share - it was ever so present throughout the hotel. However, once I told them clearly that we can't afford the time share they did not attempt it again. One more thing about the noise - the ocean side is very noisy too. We were on the 6th floor and right above one of the waterfalls. We would have appreciated if the waterfalls would have been turned off for the night. In the morning we were woken by the birds in the palm trees just in front of the balconies. Although there's nothing you can do about them it could get a bit annoying due to the sheer noise.

For $150 it's a great experience in a great location. However, there are some imperfections which may bother you more or less. The good- 1. The lobby is beautiful and tropical - waterfalls, banyan trees, flamingos, some nice places to sit, and open to the weather. It is a nice first impression. 2. The pool is stunning. It actually consists of 4 or 5 small to medium pools on approximately 3 levels, connected by landscaped walkways, 2 slides, 3 or 4 waterfalls, etc. This is part of a recent renovation and shows. This is the centerpiece of their landscaping - it is quite large and very well done. There are a couple bars, stages, and sitting areas interspersed. 3. Beach access is excellent. From our room to the beach was less than 5 minutes by elevator and foot. The beach is not really wide, but it is not crowded, and the water has just a few small waves, enough to bob in but not enough for bodysurfing. We took our 1 year old to and into the water's edge with no problem. 4. Access to the local shops and restaurants - much of lower Ka'anapali is walking distance - Whaler's Village is right next door, several restaurants, other resorts and beaches all close by. 5. The room was clean and well-appointed. Very large flat-screen TV. Small but adequate fridge, small safe. Bed was firm but had a pillowtop, so comfortable. Towels and robes are very fluffy. The fair- 1. The service overall was pretty good - but always felt a little uninterested or distant. For $400 or more per night I would have been annoyed. There were no service gaffes at all, just nothing really special. 2. The standard room is not large. There is enough space to move around in, but with a baby and 2 adults we did not have 'excess' capacity. 3. self-parking is very convenient, but the spaces are tight and sometimes you have to search a bit to find a space. The not-so-good- 1. Our room was quite noisy. We were almost directly over the front entrance and the parking lot - and you can hear cars arriving, music playing, bellhops talking, etc., until late in the evening. In addition, the doors and walls were thin. We could hear the TV in the room next door, and from the hallway we could hear other people placing their keycards in their doors, the elevator beeping (we were 3 rooms down) as it went up and down the floors, and housekeeping vacuuming the hallways in the afternoons (during prime nap time!). Bring earplugs if you are at all sensitive to this. 2. Plan to pay for the privilege of staying at this hotel. Everything costs extra. There is a $20 mandatory daily resort fee which covers 2 bottles of water, wired in-room internet access, self-parking, and gym access. The business center has computers but they charge you $.65 per minute; a mai tai at the pool cost $9.25; 1 dessert was $11; etc. It shouldn't be a surprise at a resort like this; just be prepared. 3. If you want to do anything other than wander around the beach, I recommend renting a car. We used the car almost every day to get take-out food, to go to Lahaina, to see South Maui or Haleakala, etc. There is not a lot 'to do' in Ka'anapali other than sand and sun; no history, no culture, not much in the way of 'attractions.' Overall this is a good place at the right price. The biggest problem was the noise, which was easily averted with earplugs. Otherwise no major complaints, and it was a nice splurge for us.

I traveled with my husband and 2 children, 8 and 11. I cannot say enough good things about this whole vacation experience... my husband and I were ready to move there and were sooooo sad to leave at the end of our trip. So, to begin with the Westin was a BEAUTIFUL, top notch hotel! It is right on the beach and has lots of places to eat, drink, and swim. We were restricted from the adults only pool because of our kids but we didn't mind at all. The pool area is HUGE and the kids loved it! There is a high waterslide that my son loved and also a smaller waterslide that my daughter loved. The pool area was crowded but there were plenty of chairs and towels. The staff was ALWAYS incredibly friendly and willing to assist with the smallest of details. My son was obsessed with the large Koi fish in the water areas of the hotel. :-) Our room was on the 11th floor, oceanview and the sights from the balcony were breathtaking! You could see 2 neighboring islands from our room. The Westin \"Heavenly Beds\" were heavenly to say the least as were the shower heads. The staff was even accomodating and friendly to us when I spilled my coffee in bed on the white linens. :-( I cannot say enough good things about ALL of the staff here especially our friend at the concierge desk, Cheryl. She was fantastic and set us up with a vacation ownership tour that we enjoyed and would have totally bought if we could have afforded it. Instead we are going back for a 2nd vacation on their Explorer Package. The weather was a balmy 80-85 degrees everyday in Maui with not much humidity which was pleasant. It was sunny everyday and always a rainbow to be seen! The only rain we experienced felt like spitting and never lasted long enough to ruin anything. We rented a jeep and explored the island. It was very easy to get around even for us that had no idea what we were doing. I definately recommend renting some sort of car. The jeep was great! We went into town and shopped at Hilo Hatties for Hawaiian dresses and suveniors, ate at a few places on Front Street where the cruise ships dock and anywhere you look the scenes are breathtaking. We also drove the \"Road to Hana\" because I was in Hawaii and I wasn't leaving without seeing waterfalls. Boy did I see waterfalls... It was a true paradise. I bought the book \"Maui Revealed\" and followed it on the drive to Hana. The locals don't like this book because it tells a lot but it is a great guide that tells everything! The drive to Hana and the Seven Sacred Pools was very windy and adventurous. The locals are not very kind to tourists driving up there. We understood though, their home is invaded by us daily so let them go around you if you can... also see the Black Sand Beach- it was my absolute favorite. Wear sneakers to see the waterfalls- you have to hike to get to them and I wore flip flops like a dummy. We also took a snorkel boat, The Teralani that was great and went to a luau at the Hayatt hotel that I will definately book again. There was also great snorkeling at Black Rock right down the beach from our hotel. Yes, of course the food was the most expensive part of our trip but that is to be expected, we were in Hawaii! Go to the ABC store for snacks and drinks to keep in your room and eat at Whalers Village right down the beack walk. There are some inexpensive places there.

Our family of 4 (2 teens) travelled from Canada to escape the winter and relax over the Christmas Holidays in Hawaii. Not soooo relaxing. First of all cab fare from the Kahului airport was $86 a little steep. Heard shuttles were not much cheaper and stopped several times. We booked a room with 2 double beds at the Westin, only to find out when we arrived that they had no more rooms left with 2 double beds. They (so called) upgraded us to a King with a pull out couch. When we asked for a cot they were out of those too. So imagine 2 adults and a teen in a kingsize (Heavenly) bed, not my idea of heavenly! We managed to get a cot for the duration of our two week stay, however the cot took up much of the already small rooms Our ocean view room, turned out to be only partial ocean view over looking Whaler's Village. Every morning we were woken up by garbage and delivery trucks, which always backed in and had their backup alarms on! Because the hotel was sold out over the holidays there were no other rooms available.( I guess advance reservations does not mean a thing at the Westin!) As previous guests reported, trying to get a lounge poolside or on the beach was impossible. My husband got into two squabbles with people moving our stuff off of our lounges. The towel service people kept insisting that they were timing peoples loungers and removing towels if no one sat in them after 1 hour, however we only saw this happen twice while we were there. We noticed people from other resorts coming and using the pool loungers. As well we met a family from the east side of the island that weren't staying at the Westin, but came to use the pool! (Westin has to get a handle on this as the poolside lounge issue is what all of the people were complaining about!) I know it was the Christmas holidays and the hotel was full, but the money we paid to stay at the Westin, should provide for enough pool or beach chairs for everyone staying there. Every morning was stressful, just trying to reserve a chair in order to relax(Funny!) The Westin will hound you daily to take the Timeshare Tour, They call and leave messages on your phone telling you they have a gift for you at the concierge. Do not go, if they have a gift tell them to deliver it to your room. (They won't do it!) Personally, I did not go to Hawaii to spend 2 hours of my vacation listening to a Timeshare Pitch. The restaurants Tropica and Ono's at the hotel were very expensive, Tropica was vacant most nights. The poolside food was good, but very expensive, Drinks were outrageously priced! We used the adult pool, which would have been nice if there were more adults there than kids? No one there to enforce hotel rules? The staff was mostly friendly, however when you brought up tough questions, most did not care. We used the fitness room as the $20 resort fee included this. It was very nice overlooking the pool/beach and the equipment was new. Several young kids in the fitness room which were not allowed to be there according to the posted sign of 16years and older? Other restaurants we visited in the area were Hula Grill - OK food but very busy, usually 1 hour or more wait. Rusty Harpoons - Just ok food, more of a sports bar with tvs on everywhere. Leilani's on the Beach - good food, same company owns Hula Grill and other restaurants on the beach so food is basically the same and in Maui (fairly expensive). We went to the Hyatt for Sushi, - very good but very expensive. Spat's at the Hyatt for Italian - just ok and expensive. Dan Teppanyaki at the Sheraton was just ok , heard that Kobe in Lahaini was a much better Teppanyaki show. Do not waste your money on the Luau at the Westin just under $400 for 4 people, dinner was table service just average and the show was average as well. In Waikiki we went to an original Luau, much better food and performances. Heard the Lahaina Luau is the original and worth seeing. Cheeseburger in Paradise was great. Great burgers and Mai Tai's were the best in Maui and the price was average. Whaler's Village had McDonalds, Chinese and Pizza which we saw alot of people had poolside as the price seemed to be right. Grab drinks and snacks at the ABC store and stock your room. You can also take the shuttle to Cannery Mall and stock up at Safeway, this will save you bundles in snacks for the room, breakfasts and drinks (booze too!) We went to Ruth Chris steakhouse for New Years Eve. The best meal by far, expensive but you get what you pay for. If you go before 6pm they have cheaper dinner specials. We did not rent a car and found we did not miss having one. Several people complained about the lack of parking at the Westin for their rental vehicles. Activities we took in were Whale Watching on the Teralani. Excellent and reasonably priced, you get drinks and snacks on the Catamaran and get to see whales - guaranteed. We took surfing lessons just down the beach infront of the Marriott, again a good price, good instruction and awesome surfing, our kids really enjoyed this. We had to go and play tennis at the Sheraton as the Westin did not have tennis courts. We golfed across the street at Kaanapali North and South courses and really enjoyed ourselves. We all rented clubs and it was reasonable. We had a bite at the Clubholuse and was much cheaper than the Westin and good food, however service was slow. Went snorkelling and cliff jumping infront of the Sheraton - Awesome! We took a shuttle into Lahaina twice for shopping and looking around. The shuttle there was quick and convenient, however coming back took over an hour as the shuttle stopped and waited at two other hotels before arriving back at the Westin. We took in the Mercedes Golf open in Kapalua which was great, saw many great golfers up close. You must go see this course if you're a golfer, excellent location, layout and beautiful clubhouse. Several celebrities have their homes right on this beautiful golfcourse. The hotel has a hospitality room if you have a late checkout that you can use to shower change, however you only have it for 30 minutes or you can pay $295 to extend you stay until 6pm! Hope this review helps others make informative choices when it comes to hotels and Maui restaurants and activities. Would probably look at staying at either the Hyatt or the Sheraton as we spoke with several people who had no complaints with either of these hotels. The Kaanapali beach that runs infront of all of these hotels is the same and is spectacular!

All in all, it wasn't a horrible stay - but it was disappointing. Next year we will make sure we book early enough so that we can stay at Kaanapali Beach Hotel. Yes....it's outdated and doesn't have large beautiful swimming pools. But, we will be made to feel welcome by the staff with amentities like turn down service, cookies on our pillows and a friendly family type atmosphere. We will also be able to find an available chaise lounge in the nice large shaded pool area where I can sit under a tree and read with some quiet and privacy without feeling like I'm practically on top of the person next to me.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cvery disappointed in Westin experience\u201d", "Author": "4fortheroad", "ReviewID": "UR12221310", "Content": "We just got back tonight from 10 days in Hawaii. While in Kauai we were VERY happy at the Grand Hyatt,for 5 days when we got to Maui and to the Westin Resort and Spa, we were extremely disappointed. We spent 5 somewhat unpleasant days at the Westin. The hotel is extremely crowded and noisy, the beach and pool areas too congested. There is nothing relaxing about the hotel. There is a morning battle for chairs at the pool, or a line to wait in at 8 am to get chairs on the beach- which they usually run out of by 8:15. Or you can sign up to try to get a cabana for a ridiculous amount of additional money. We were unable to get one until our last day which rained non-stop. The lobby is loud beyond belief with the faux waterfalls and birds which get even louder around sunset. There is no where to sit to get some peace and quiet especially if it is raining. There are no comfy cozy lounge chairs indoors. The only place to go is the tiny, musty bedroom. I couldn't even open my porch door because the next door neighbor was always out on his porch smoking cigarettes and the smell would waft right in. On the positive side, the staff was very friendly, concierge services were good and the food surprisingly decent for this kind of hotel. We were traveling with extended family totalling 10 and no one was happy with the choice of hotel and room accomodations. Even the Westin \"heavenly bed\" was uncomfortable!

But beware; you get what you pay for here. If you go with this deal, you will be placed in a very small room overlooking the dumpsters from the shopping center next door. If that doesn't please you, you might be offered a \"free upgrade\" to a slightly larger room overlooking the hotel parking lot, but they will also encourage you to check out their premium rooms overlooking the pools and the ocean. You will want that room! Because it's bigger, it's luxurious and it overlooks the ocean and the pools. If you take the bait, it will set you back about an additional $1k for a five night stay. To offset the price, they will offer you a few hundred dollars in hotel credits for taking the timeshare tour. So, no worries, we're on vacation, let's enjoy! We stayed in a premium room overlooking it all on the 8th floor and it was grand...until we took the timeshare tour. We have done this on two occasions, and enjoyed the hotel because it is centrally located and, though somewhat outdated, quite nice. However, I don't think we will go back because we were so put off by the timeshare hard sell. We took the tour and while the timeshare condos are nice, they do not offer the same experience as the hotel, and we told them early on that we were not interested in buying one (wow! do the math! they are selling each condo for around $2 million!). They passed us from one salesperson to the next and tried every tactic imaginable to make a sale - it took hours and we couldn't get away. When they finally realized we were truly not buying, they became quite rude. At one point, a snippy woman popped into the room and said, \"Well, you've been here twice and not purchased, so I can assure you you will never be invited back to the hotel again.\" Then turned on her heel and stalked off. But within fifteen minutes, there was another fellow hammering us, trying to get us to write them a check for $3k to reserve our room at the inn next year! Huh?? Weren't we just banished from this place?? A nice hotel, but a lot more focus on the guest's current vacation experience and a lot less on selling timeshares would certainly make it more enjoyable.

I usually stay at mid-level hotels. I got lucky and got a good rate at this one. It has a very beautiful lobby and pool area. Everything is open and connected. They have tied in fish and wildlife into the many pools on the property. The rooms were small. For the price I would have thought they'd be bigger. They did have a nice LCD tv in it though. I stayed in an ocean view. I think a partial ocean view would have been the same and might be cheaper. The non ocean view rooms face a golf course and a large mountain. I took more pictures of the mountain than of the water. The food at the hotel is good, but it will cost you. Many of the restaurants around the area change names at night and expand their menus for dinner. The westin is right next to the Whaler's village. It has a lot of nice shops and a couple nice restaurants. If you walk up the main walk between the hotels you will find something you like. We ate at the Hyatt and the Sheraton and both were very good. ($$ though) Beware of the timeshare sales... or should I say, go see one. The concierge told us if we went to look at some of the property they would give us $100 to spend at the hotel. She didn't mention that we'd have to sit through a sales pitch first. The up side is, tell them you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want one and you'll get your $100 to spend at any of the Starwood hotels. You'll also get 50% off your next hotel stay. It rained the entire time we were there. The worst flooding they've had in 27 years. That is not the norm. You are only 5 miles from Lahaina where there are tons of shops and restaurants to get out of the sun or rain. The staff will go out of their way to help you plan a day or book a reservation. They have a large book of restaurants with menus so you can view them before you book. As far as the pools go, they have a ton of them. The kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool has two water slides. There are other pools deemed for adults only that are ok. There is a nice large waterfall that connects two pools via a cave feature. There is a small hidden pool underneath the waterfall. It would have been better if it was heated. Many of the hotels have small hot tubs. I suppose when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot out no one uses them, but I like to. Plan on spending $10 per adult beverage. You do get a large slice of pineapple with each one. One other negative besides the room size. They have free wifi, but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring a computer, they will charge by the minute to use one of theirs. They have two or three upstairs in a business room that is monitored.

I went with my boyfriend and we had a fabulous time anyways there. We enjoyed the Hyatt a lot more and thought the rooms were slightly bigger and the room service there was ON POINT!!!! The Westin room service is very slow. The hotel itself is wonderful with awesome swimming pools, but like I said it's more for family then a couple. I wasn't really impressed with the Heavenly showers and yes, they could use a bathroom upgrade! The Heavenly Beds were indeed very comfortable and the flat screen TV's were a plus, but other then that...the rooms were a little old and could use a little work. If you are not picky then you wouldn't mind it like we didn't mind it. One day I did find little ants all around our wet bar, but room service sprayed it and they went away. Don't forget to sign up for your free 4x6 Photo at the Photography desk. Also, if you sign up as a Starwood Member before you go... you can qualify for a room upgrade. We got a partial ocean view and they upgraded us to a full oceanview room because we were members. IF it is your anniversary... call them before you get there and they give you a free bottle of champagne!!! The beach at the Westin... um what beach not really much of a beach at all. The water is awesome but there is not much sand. Go down towards the Sheraton and go to Black Rock Beach. The water and beach is a lot bigger and nicer. OR you can drive up to Kapalua Bay where the beach is very calm and beautiful. It is about a 15 minute drive...ask the concierge how to get there. LISTEN CLOSE... If you are looking to save some money here are some tips! Rusty Harpoons which is in Whaler's Village (walking distance of 1 minute) has awesome Happy Hour specials from 2-6pm. Cheap drinks and cheap appetizers. Definitely buy what you need from the ABC store also located in the Whaler's Village. A lot of the restaurants (especially at the Hotel) are very very expensive and will put a hole in your wallet. Our solution? We would go to the Aloha Mixed Plate often which has AWESOME BBQ food for a CHEAP CHEAP price. Don't forget to order their banana cheesecake dessert...it is amazing!!! If you are in the mood for some Chinese food there is a pretty decent Chinese Restaurant called China Bowl with normal price about 5-8 minutes away (driving). Out of the Westin you make a right and then a left onto 30. In a shopping center on the left you should see China Bowl . We had decent Chinese food for an average price (not expensive). If you want to go get great Sushi... go to Sansei which is in Kapalua (15 minute drive). The price is normal for sushi (not cheap), but they have great food there!! If you are looking for a great Luau... I suggest the Feast at Lele. Expensive (about 105 a person), but definitely worth it for the food and entertainment. Also, if you want to go snorkeling... I suggest go to Molokini with Four Winds II. Molokini is one of the top snorkel/dive spots in the world and the captain on Four Winds will keep you company. His crew will take great care of you and I suggest going on the morning tour instead of the afternoon tour. The morning tour is around 85-90 dollars (can't remember), but it includes a boat ride from 7:30 am -12pm to beautiful Molokini. You get served breakfast AND lunch (it is yummy too), and you get to snorkel for a long time!!! It is so worth the money and the crew is awesome. They have lifeguards that look after you and the crew is watching you for your safety!!! Bottom line...just keep in mind you are in Maui, on of the most beautiful places on earth, it is expensive...so have fun and expect to spend that cash!!!! Would I stay here again? Yes, but would I prefer to stay at the Hyatt? YES! It is still a great place to stay here at the Westin...", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cThe awesome location and pool make it special!\u201d", "Author": "mwooduk", "ReviewID": "UR11264769", "Content": "We loved this hotel.

I'm a Gold Starwood member and we got a lovely room on a high floor with an ocean view. Very nice to wake up to the sounds of the crashing waves and waterfalls and high enough not to be bothered by the sounds of the seemingly endless kids at the pools. Rooms were pretty standard, not particulary new, but quite clean (although my mother was convinced that the tub wasn't being cleaned properly). Nice new flat screen tvs, daily beach towel service (because I am Gold), comfy beds, the \"heavenly \" double-headed shower, and a mini fridge in the room which we stuffed with a few quick breakfast items in order to avoid the $30 breakfast buffet. The resort offers several pool options, nicely landscaped grounds, proximity to a small shopping center with a couple of good beachside restaurants and a Borders express bookstore. I concur with others that it is particulary family friendly, so I was happy to have the adult pool option which really did seem to drown out the kiddie noise. As someone mentioned, there's something about water that compels kids to jump and scream, but they all seemed to be having a great time. The beach front is beautiful and although public, never seemed overrun. There's a lovely boardwalk along the beach where people jog in the mornings and walk from one resort to the next. We did have to pay an additional fee to rent a beach chair and umbrella and there were far too few. My mom had to run down early in the morning and do the towel and magazine leave-behind routine in order to secure chairs. I will agree that service was a little lackluster in terms of timeliness from \"Service Express\" and the elevators are ridiculously slow, but chalk that up to near maximum occupancy during a busy time. Not much different than any conference hotel I've ever stayed at. The walls were definitely a bit thin too - we could hear the TV ( although I think the volume was maxed out) and conference calls in the room next door. In any case, overall we generally enjoyed our stay at the hotel except for the 3 hrs we spent listening to the Vacation Villas timeshare sales pitch. And be advised that if you choose not to buy, right away, they'll offer you a $2500 vacation \"deal\" with mucho points, more time to decide on the villas and a 7 day future stay at the hotel in a terrace mountain view room (read ground floor room with a view of the parking lot). And although they make it sound like it's no big deal if you choose to buy/not to buy, we definitely got the full court \"end of the month\" sales pressure.

We were there for a time share 5 day preview \"deal\" therefore we had the parking lot view on the second floor. (I'm sure it would have been prettier to be on a higher floor on the ocean side) The bed and concierge staff truly were the best part of the experience. The hotel lobby is beautiful without a doubt. The room itself was rather small. The hotel cleaning staff were very loud each morning around 8am, talking loudly and sounding as though they were yelling to each other through the hall. There was also an abundance of children running in the hallways at early hours. If you are a \"pool\" person, you'll love this place. There were several huge beautiful pools complete with waterfalls and water slides. I'm more of a beach person and the beach at the Westin was very small (almost no place to sit because the ocean comes in so far) and there was no space to put a chair on the beach. If you rent their cabana (for a mere 60.00 per day) you either have to sit up at the pool or have a view of the paved walkway and then a hedge where you can't really see the waves crashing. The positive is that the beaches along that strip are all public, so we went up to the Sheraton beach (10 min. walk) and rented their cabana for 40.00 and snorkeled at the black rock area. The beach there had plenty of sand and places to sit or lay out on your towel. (The Westin and Sheraton are in the same corporation and you can charge on your room at the Sheraton.) The snorkeling was excellent there - we saw many sea turtles on the different days we were in the water. The Westin was quite accomodating and sent a microwave to our room when we requested it so we could heat a lunch in our room too. Overall it was a fun stay but I wouldn't return to this property. I heartily recommend the Maui revealed guide book (make sure you have the 4th edition). Also strongly recommend you make reservations ahead of time to see the Warren and Annabelle Magic show in Lahaina. Warren is the most incredible illusionist ! I'm still awake at night trying to figure out what he did in front of my eyes - no smoke and mirrors and quite the small (78 seat) audience.

We called the front desk who assured us the noise would stop (drilling started again at 8:30am). After getting absolutely no where with the front desk, we spoke with the Manager (a god-send) who was able to move us to the 10th floor. On the day of departure, our flight happened to be a red-eye so we inquired about a late checkout. We were told that this would cost us an additional $250.00 (for 4 measly hours). The front desk woman then had the gall to say, \"Well, I'm sorry we wrecked your honeymoon...\" after we questioned the charge. We reported her comments and behavior to the manager. Needless to say, the Westin Maui's front desk personnel left a very bitter taste. Had it not been for management, this review would have been much worse.

The rooms were half price - around $259 for a partial ocean view room - 4th floor, not the remodeled Tower, but we loved our room, even though it had not been remodeled - had a view of the pool, waterfall, AND ocean - our balcony was right above the waterfall - we left our lanai door open a crack every night to hear the water soothe us to sleep. We enjoyed the pools, and even did the waterslide a few times with the kids! The room had 2 double beds, small bathroom, refrigerator - adequate for us. The Heavenly Beds were just that. We found orchids, beautiful cards with Hawaiian sentiments on them, and chocolates on our pillows every night. (Because of the SPG status? I don't know... but we loved it!) We toured the spa, didn't use it, but it's lovely, with a beautiful view. We LOVED getting 1/2 price drinks and \"pupus\" at theTropica Restaurant every afternoon, from 3-5pm - then we skipped dinner and had dessert later! They have a lavender vinagrette that was outstanding. We also loved Tropica for the breakfast buffet - yes it's pricey at $25, but we only did it once, and loved the eggs benedict, tropical fruits and juices, waffles, omelets made to order, etc. There was also an abundance of Japanese specialties, including sashimi, rice, fish soups, etc. For breakfast mind you! :) We also enjoyed the proximity to Whaler's Village outdoor shopping mall, just a minutes walk down the beach path. It was also just a 10 minute walk down the beach to the Sheraton, where we had delicious coffee one morning, and caught our snorkeling tour. We had dinner at Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina, and loved the funky, touristy atmosphere. All in all we loved the Westin, yes it can be pricey, but you have to find the deals, and realize its a resort, not a quiet, romantic hideaway - of course there's going to be kids and a little chaos!

During most of our previous Maui visits, we've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui, and chose the Westin frankly due to a much better rate. I was nervous because our Hyatt visits were always so pleasant and the bar was set high for our first stay at the Westin. The Westin Maui exceeded most of my family's expectations. We we very impressed with the expansive fantasy pool, ocean-view spa, and comfortable, well-appointed rooms (newly remodeled with flat-panel TVs as well as Westin's signature Heavenly Bed and Bath amenities). In addition to the solid accommodations and amenities, we found the resort's dining to be well above average (better than most, if not all of the other Ka'anapali Beach resorts). The variety of dining options from full service (where children 5 and under eat free) to high-quality self service dining suited our family needs as well as budgets nicely. As well as catering to families very well, it also seems to provide an equal level of accommodation to couples looking for romance. There is an adults-only pool where you could hear a pin drop, and one of the nicer spas and fitness centers on Ka'anapali Beach. The Westin Maui's only major drawback is that the property is aging, and it it shows in the small room size (smaller than current standards) and dated architecture. What ultimately sets this resort apart from many local competitors, however, is the superior service. The staff was polite, helpful, and quick to provide assistance at a moment's notice. This was evident in nice gestures like a letter and phone call from concierge before our arrival to offer assistance, valet parking our car for free when the self-service lot was full, and the food service staff doing little things to make the kids' dining experience more kid-friendly. Overall, despite its drawbacks, it is a very solid four-star resort and I highly recommend it to families and couples alike.

I heard nothing but complaining and whining about small rooms, busy times and how expensive everything was. I decided to go and see for myself and not worry about what others had said. We spent 10 wonderful days there. The weather was awesome...85 every day. The pool was big, clean and refreshing and it was always easy to find a lounge to sit on. The pool, restaurant and housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were spacious with a mountain view. They were clean and well replenished with all the amenities that were needed. There was always lots to do to and great restaurants to eat at. The tours and activities people were great and helped us choose fun things to do. We parasailed, snorkled on the Gemini catamaran and went to the Westin Polynesian Luau. So here's the thing........I had the best birthday ever with my family and I will visit the Westin again. We went and had a great time and didn't worry about anything. If you want to go on vacation choose a hotel to stay at within your price range, don't go at the busy times of the year(I took my kids out of school and they did their homework on the plane) and expect to pay high prices. You shouldn't have to worry about how much you are spending on your vacation..........coz if you are, you are not having a vacation!!! Places to go and things to do? Visit the Hula Grill and Rusty's Harpoon.Check out the Whalers Village for lots of great shops. ABC is your best store there for inexpensive food, gifts and liquor.

Overall, we were very happy with our stay. They upgraded us to a high floor mountain view room for no additional charge. We were greeted with a fresh orchid lei (for me) and a ti leaf lei for my husband, which we affectionately referred to as the \"Man Lei\". Check in was pretty easy, however, our room was not ready until a few hours after we got there. The hotel was nice enough to call us on my cell phone when the room was ready. Our room was very clean and had been recently updated with rich looking dark furniture, flat screen TV and very comfortable Westin \"Heavenly Beds\". The bathroom was a little on the small side but was very clean and had a great dual head shower. Directly across from the bathroom sink (which was separate from the shower & toliet) is a handy mini bar area, which provided additional counterspace, coffeemaker, mini fridge and in-room safe. Housekeeping tended to be slow and we actually had to call them on 2 separate occasions to have our room cleaned - a trend that I'm noticing more and more with large hotels. The concierge was very helpful with providing us with restaurant recommendations and activities. However, she did try to push the Timeshare presentation on us a bit, promising an extra $100 resort credit. We respectfully declined and that was the end of the pressure, which was nice. The grounds and the pools were lush and very tropical looking. The pool does get crowded from 11am-2pm. We noticed that it definitely lightens up after 3pm and there is still plenty of great sun to soak in! At sunset, have a cocktail at the adult pool bar - it's so beautiful and relaxing. They have live Hawaiian music playing every night as well. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, but a little pricey at $25.00 a piece. You should try it at least once - you won't be disappointed! Be sure to take advantage of the lovely beach path that winds all through Ka'anapali Beach - it's a great way to check out the other resorts in the area. One last thing - ladies, you must try the Spa at this hotel - it's top notch! I had the Bamboo Lemongrass Scrub with a Vichy Shower and it was probably the best treatment I've ever had!

The room also came with a small refrigerator that was located under the sink, coffee maker, cordless phone,and nice Westin amenities. The bathroom itself was kind of small and looked like it could use an update. The so-called 'heavenly shower' was nothing more than a dual shower head. At least we had no issues with the water pressure, hot water, or drainage. Everything seem to be working just fine. The sink is separated from the toilet and shower area, which made it nice when getting ready in the morning. There were a lot of families with kids at the hotel during this time. We could hear kids running through the halls in the morning which made sleeping late impossible. Also, since we were above the parking lot, we heard the garbage truck doing it's service with its loud beeping. The hotel itself is rather large. The grounds are beautiful with the pools and huge koi pond with waterfalls. We didn't try any of the hotel restaurants. However, Whaler's Village is right next door within walking distance and it offers more reasonable priced restaurants and menus along with shops like Coach, Cinnamon Girl, Crazy Shirts, ABC stores, etc... Definitely worth checking out just to buy refreshments and snacks from the ABC store as it will save you money. Although we didn't try it, there is a tiny food court in Whaler's Village with a McDonalds and other fast food alternatives. The Westin does charge a $20/day resort fee. This includes admission to the workout facility, high-speed internet access in your room, two bottles of water in your refrigerator replenished daily, self parking, shuttle service to Kapalua West Maui Airport, Kaanapali, Lahaina, and the tennis facilities upon availability, a Westin Maui souvenir shopping bag, a complimentary 4x6 color photo which you can schedule by appointment when you arrive at the hotel. (Although, all the appointments were already taken for our 2 days we were there. So try to scehdule early if you are interested.) Self Parking is included in the reseort fee. The parking lot is way too small for the size of the hotel. It fills up very quickly, especially in the evening hours. If it is full, then valet is free. Also note that the parking stalls are compact!! We were never hassled at all by the timeshare people. Here's some other tips: Fly into Kapalua West Maui Airport. The Westin is located only 10 minutes from this airport. It is a teeny tiny airport that is only serviced by Go and Island Airlines and other small aircraft. It has the island feeling and not crowded at all. Go to the Lahaina Cannery Mall which is located a short 5 minute drive from the Westin. Here you can stock up on snacks and drinks from Safeway. There is also a Longs and ABC store along with some other small shops. There is a food court that offers mexican, italian, vietnamese, greek and local cuisine (L&L). There is also a Dairy Queen. So good to eat that ice cream cone when it's 90 degrees outside! We tried eating at Compadres Mexican Restaurant one night for dinner and it was pretty good. It wasn't crowded at all and the service was great! Prices were reasonable considering the prices at the hotel restaurants! Overall, we enjoyed our short stay at the Westin. I would definitely stay here again if I got it at the same price.

If you're like me, and some of the other posts were making you nervous about your choice, read this review. The Westin Maui is a beautiful hotel. We were in the Ocean tower, partial ocean view room, 4th floor, overlooking the lobby waterfalls. The room had been recently renovated, w/ granite countertops and a flat screen TV. The only problem I had w/ the hotel, that I read others have had as well, is that when we went to check in, the only room available was a room w/ 2 doubles. I had requested a King. Maybe others already know this, but I learned a valuable lesson: When you book through Expedia (like I did) or another service, and not through the Westin itself, or if your travel agent didn't guarantee a king room, you will not have one. I got a little agitated until I read my itinerary, and it plainly states that Expedia will forward my requests to the Westin, but w/ no guarantees. They did offer to put us in a king room the next day, however, after seeing how beautiful our room and view were, we decided to keep what we had. The aquatic playground is fantastic - in fact, the best pool area in the Kaanapoli area. The beach is beautiful, however, the shore break can be a little treacherous. There was never a lack of chairs, however, if you want to sit in the shade, I recommend putting your towel down and reserving early in the morning. (they say you can not do this, but everybody does so don't worry about it) A few helpful tips: Never valet your car - the parking is very convenient, and if it's full (which it usually is, especially in the evenings, valet is FREE!) Our room package included the breakfast buffett at either the Westin, Westin Villas, or Sheraton (right down the boardwalk). We preferred the breakfast buffett at the Sheraton. If you do not want to be \"harrassed\" by timeshare sales people, like is mentioned in many of the reviews, simply do not go to the concierge desk. They will try to entice you w/ a free gift, and leave you a voice mail. Simply do not ever stop by that desk and you will be fine. Alcoholic drinks are very expensive: Go to the ABC at Whalers Village, mix in the room in the provided coffee cups, and enjoy at the pool! Dinner in Maui is expensive, but worth it. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. 1. Do not miss happy hour at Rusty Harpoons in Whalers Village between 2-5 (Mai Tai's for $3.50) The food is great, as well. (Be sure to get the lettuce wraps) 2. The Feast at Lele (Luau in Lahaina) is not to be missed. It is the most expensive ($105 pp) but worth it. It's a 5 course menu and very romantic. 3. Aloha Mixed Plate is a local dive, and a more resonable restaurant to give your wallet a break. Lot's of good authentic Hawaiian food (Front Street in Lahaina). 4. Sansei in Kapalua is Japanese w/ an Hawaiian flare, and was one of the best meals we had while in Maui. (order the tempura fried ice cream!) 5. Longhi's on Front street in Lahaina. Italian w/ Hawaiian flare. Go on Friday night - The band starts at 10 upstairs. 6. David Pauls in Lahaina. Very good, but the most expensive meal we had, (besides the Luau) but not the best meal we had. 7. Mama's Fish House in Paia - DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE - (make reservations) The atmosphere is fantastic. And the food is incredible. This was the best place we ate and experienced all week. We didn't drive to Hana, but the drive through Paia to see the windsurfers is nice. Also, be sure not to miss \"Big Beach\" in Makena (drive through Kihei and Wailea) Big Beach is the best and biggest beach and hasn't been spoiled by development (about 45 minutes from the Westin) Walk up the cliff to \"Little Beach,\" but be advised, clothing is optional at Little Beach. I hope this review helps. I would highly recommend the Westin Maui for a honeymoon or any other trip.

The pools were nice with the largest being only 4 ft deep all the way around, so I could hold my son everywhere around the pool and under the waterfalls. The beach in front is great but a bit crowded with all the resorts in Kaanapali. Our room had 2 full beds and a mountain view. Very nice view. One day we saw a rainbow outside our window. They put a lot of furniture in that small remodeled room, so our little one did not have any room to cruise around, especially after they put the crib in...very tight quarters. The Heavenly beds were soft but due to my back strain, I needed a firmer bed. Most people would love the beds. The crib also had a thicker heavenly crib mattress, which was firm. Unfortunately, the room had a dank kinda smell, which is probably due to the humidity outside. The location is great. We did not try the restaurants because we thought they were way overpriced. We walked over to the Sheraton Maui, full hotel charge privileges, and had lunch there at a more reasonable \"Maui\" price. Everything in Maui is expensive so $12-14 per person for lunch was reasonable. Next time, we would probably get a condo or a place with more room for our baby.

We came from the Four Seasons which we loved (see our review sam0825), so take our comments in light of that. There is no comparison between the 2 hotels in terms of luxury and service - the Four Seasons far surpasses. But the Westin would certainly appeal to tourists and those with families (mainly because of the pool area with water slides and lots of kids). Upon arrival we were \"upgraded\" from the ocean view room we booked to a deluxe ocean view room - BEWARE! The deluxe ocean view rooms in the beach tower - at least ours - face partially ocean and partially parking lots and other buildings. Our \"deluxe\" room on the Starwood preferred guest floor was very small, dark dank and dirty, with low stucco ceilings, an outdated bathroom and a TV from the 1990s. Having come from an immaculate spacious room at the Four Seaons, we asked to be \"downgraded\" back to our original ocean view room. We were the next day, to a room in the ocean tower. It was 100 times better! the room was still small but clean and modern with a beautiful view of the ocean and pools, and a large flat screen TV. [By the way, the fact that we had to wait until the next day to get our original room which was unavailble when we checked in made us realize that we were likely not upgraded, rather they gave our room away]. The hotel lobby and pools definitely have a wow factor, although a bit cartoonish. But if you are a tourist who wants to feel like they're in Hawaii, this would fit the bill. The best part was the beautiful beach, although you have to pay $25 to reserve an umbrella and 2 [incredibly uncomfortable] beach chairs. And if you don't do it by 7:30 AM you probably won't get one. And they make you vacate the chairs and umbrella at 4:30 which is completely ridiculous and well before sunset which is beautiful and worth watching from the beach. We found the pool area to be very crowded and dirty. The one day that we decided to sit there rather than the beach, we had to move since there was so much garbage on the ground, the birds were attacking it. The water in the pools was also pretty dirty. There is very limited seating in the shade, and there is minimal staff checking to see if you'd like a drink. We loved the restaurant Tropica and ate there at least twice. Have your breakfast over there too - same menu and buffet as the one by the pool but less crowded with a view of the ocean.

Be prepared to pay $$ for beach umbrella/chair rentals though. On resort restaurants were pretty good and moderately pricey for Maui. Nice thing about the Westin is that many of the water based activities (sailing,para-sailing, etc) launch from the beach right there. Also, whalers village is directly next door.

We were greeted by a hostess (not a very nice or friendly one) then passed off to a server that kept us waiting forever while he watched the football game at the bar there. We ordered our food finally. Then another order to another table came out and another table was served. Our food was on a stand while the other table was being served. A bird flew on our food, pecked and ate at it, then fully disrespected it and deficated on it. They tried to serve it to us!! I told our server \"see the bird do-do on my food? I can't eat that\". He said \"I know\". No apology was made, nor an offer to replace the order. The server sneered at me and then huffed away. We left deeming the food unreliable for sanitary reasons. The people at the hostess desk shrugged their shoulders and couldn't care less. Then to add insult to injury, one little worker said \"it's outdoors, what do you expect\"? Hmmm....perhaps serving one table at a time would be a start. That outlet and it's nasty workers are gross. \"Rusty Harpoons\" and \"Leilanis\" much better, good service, no attitude, and no bird dropping in food. The room service was great!

I know that everyone has different experiences based on when they go and what happens but I had a good experience.

I could have cared less but it was nice of the lady checking me in to offer me the stuff. It was good customer service and I appreciated it. The grounds are very nice. In the lobby there is an artificial pond with 4 pink flamingoes, 2 swans, lots of koi fish and some large tropical birds. I heard one of them say \"hi\" a few times. The pool/pond complex is amazing, there are various pools, tunnels, and waterfalls. There is even a whirlpool in one of the tunnels. There is also a waterslide but I didn't use it. I've heard that the pool area can be very crowded but it wasn't at the time I went (after labor day) I had no problem getting a spot at any time of day but I can see how it would really suck if the pool was so crowded that you can't even get a spot. All of the phones in the hotel have a one touch \"service express\" button that you can press. I used it to order room service and it rang just once and the pleasant lady answered and addressed me by name. She transferred me to room service and a while later after I had eaten she called me back to ask me how the room service was. I was pretty impressed by that. I have to say that I experienced pleasant and courteous service by every staff that I encountered. The room is a bit smallish but nice and clean. Most of the rooms have balconies. There is a large screen t.v. with cable, a safe large enough for a large laptop and a small refrigerator and in room coffee maker with coffee, cups, creamers, etc. It is very expensive to eat on the grounds. For example, it was 17 dollars and something cents for a large coffee, a muffin and a half-papaya. But not to fret, there is a free shuttle to Lahaina. You need only to show your room key to board but I always tipped the driver a dollar. The prices are lower there and Hawaii sales tax is only 4.166%. There is also whaler's village shopping center which is literally right next door. Their food court is a joke but will do the job in a pinch. Oh, another thing, if you charge something to your room they AUTOMATICALLY add gratuity! I think I tipped twice before I figured that out and I always tip 20%. I felt so used! Read the fine print on the room charge thingy. There was a free hula show at whaler's village. They were like hula students and they really brought it! The workout room was ok, the equipment was quite old but everything worked like it was supposed to and all the cardio equipment has a t.v. in front.

The hotel seems to have stagnated over the past few years with no updates or upgrades and the experience was NOTHING that I have experienced from other Starwood Properties. I got a package deal from Starwood for $795 for 5 nights, which is a great deal for anywhere on the island. But, we would have paid more to stay in a calm, romantic environment. Or at least one with a staff that was not rude. Our 6 year old neice was part of our group and when she went to get a lei (they were out hanging to be easily placed on arriving guests - but not us) one of the people in the lobby (bell boy? valet? who knows..) yelled at her. It was totally embarrasing. The woman that checked us in was so unpleasant and placed us in a double room \"as I requested\". At no time did I request this, and when I told her we were there on our anniversary, she said \"good for you - but you requested 2 beds\". Really? that is how we are treated as Starwood gold members? At least someone came to put the beds together that night. But the headboards were not moved, so there was this huge gap and the pillows fell between the wall and the bed within 5 minutes. I could go on, but the other reviews seem to cover everything. I will say that our last night in Maui we ended up staying an extra night, so we checked into the Hyatt. From the moment we got there and proceeded to the front desk, we looked at each other with that look - we instantly knew we should have been here the entire stay.

This was a well-managed place with helpful staff and largely followed the standards I've come to expect at Westin hotels. Our room was up to date with granite countertops in the bathroom/bar area and a flat panel TV. We did talk to one person on the management staff who indicated that our tower (Ocean Tower) had recently been remodeled and that the other tower was scheduled to be remodeled in the next year. I suspect that some of the negative reviews could be based on which tower folks stayed. For the standard room rate, I can certainly understand how there would be disappointment at an out of date room. A few notes: - the grounds are beautiful, but it is crowded. Occupancy stays above 90% year round. Pool chairs have to be grabbed VERY early in the day if you want a good spot (or spot at all). This did not bother us too much, but if you are looking for a quiet, romantic getaway, this might not be the place. Those not solely concerned about the traffic, or have kids - no worries. Everything is still clean and beautiful. - Amenities are high. Morning coffee is over $4!!!! However, prices are high all over the island, so considering hotels always charge more, I think that this is more reflective of the locale. - Housekeeping/maintance/bellhop and other services keep up remarkably well, despite the traffic - has all the usual good stuff....heavenly bed & shower, Westin ambiance, great service, etc. - Parking is FREE. And, if the lot is full, valet becomes FREE - Concierges are plentiful and extremely helpful - HEAVY emphasis on the Villas (timeshare property down the street). We received several perks for attending a free sales presentation. Overall, I gave up the time (advertised as 90 minutes, but took longer), because of the perks, so can't complain too hard. However, all the concierges try and sign you up for the sales demo and the pitch is pretty hard. Our sales agent was pleasant and helpful, but when the manager came in at the end to give us the hard sell, it started feeling a bit distasteful. I'm a loyal Starwood customer and don't need the \"hard sell\" treatment. The Manager seemed disappointed and even put off after we finally convinced her that we would not buy that day. A little too much for me. OK, but the program is cool if you can afford it. - Restaurants are OK. We weren't disappointed as the environment is great.

Our experience was mixed. This is a very large, very busy, high rise hotel. The common areas are bustling and crowded at all hours of the day and night. My opinion is that the infrastructure is not adequate to keep up with the number of rooms (meaning guests) in the hotel. For example, the self parking lot fills up and you have to valet park your car. This service is free if self parking is full, but then you are forced to wait for the valets to get your car for you - not an easy task considering the cars are stacked to maximize the number of cars in the lot. The wait can be up to 20 minutes during prime time - definitely call for your car a half hour before you want it. The line at the coffee bar is 15 minutes long in the morning. And by the way, I paid $50 for 2 bagels, a yogurt, a banana, a bottle of OJ, a muffin, and precut fruit one morning. We waited for elevators all the time. The worst part, however, is the pool area. The Westin has done a good job of cramming a pool lounge into every possible nook or cranny of the large and lovely pool area. Even so, there was not a chair to be had between the hours of 8AM and 4PM every day of my stay. And unless you are willing to get up with the sun, forget about a chair under an umbrella. These are reserved by resourceful early risers by 6:15AM, despite the hotel's policy against it. Being on east coast time, I watched from my balcony as guests dropped towels, books, and pool toys on rows of chairs at 6AM then walked back into the hotel. It was very disappointing as my kids wanted to spend more time at the pool, but there was no place to sit! Other reviewers have written about the rooms. The rooms are small, but clean, comfortable, and laid out well. I had no trouble storing 4 suitcases full of stuff into the dresser/armoire.

My husband and I did not particulary enjoy our stay mainly because of the congested layout of the pool area and the crowds and noise. The property is not very wide so the pool area is folded together on multiple levels with little or no views of the beach. The entire main level is noisy and the area near the restaurants and pool is crowded and has a Disney World feel to it. The Ka'anapali beach is a nice long strip of golden sand with high rise hotels and condos (approx. 12 story) along it with a sidewalk running down the strip connecting all the properties. We did not care for this Miami beach type of layout of the area. The area just outside the Westin has a few restaurants and an entrance to the shopping mall, so this area is also crowded most of the time. The hotel is decorated very well in a sleek updated beach design, however, our room (and hall & elevator) was too worn and not cleaned well (for the price) and the \"heavenly bed\" had a mound in the center.

My husband and two sons, ages 12 and 18, had already spent seven nights at the ResortQuest Maui Banyan condos at around $350 per night. We had been so active during the first seven days of our trip to Maui, I thought we would enjoy the water park and resort atmosphere of the Westin. What a disappointment. The first room I was given (room 375) had multiple holes in the carpet and dirt on the bathroom floor. For the price of $715 per night, I was shocked the room was so rundown, not to mention dirty. It was in the Ocean Tower on the third floor with a view of the parking lot, dumpster and roof of the restaurant next door. If you could look beyond all this, you would see the ocean view, which was magnificent but spoiled by the proximity of the parking lot. I returned to the check-in desk to complain about all this, and was given another room on the seventh floor (room 787). It was closer to the ocean and high enough that the restaurant view wasn't as offensive, but we were still aware of it. The Westin promotes its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heavenly Bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \"Heavenly Shower.\" The bed was fine, and the double shower-head is indeed heavenly, but it was in a bathroom with little or no ventilation, and steam condensed on the ceiling in large drops, which then rained down on the bathroom floor. No wonder the bathroom smelled like mildew. A few hours after check-in, I received a message saying the concierge had a gift for me. I went to meet her and she presented me with a box of candy, then gave me the hard-sell to attend a 90-minute time-share sales pitch for the newly-built Westin villas, which are nearby. After paying a room rate of $715 per night, I was insulted to be getting a time-share sales pitch. I had chosen the Maui Westin because its pool area is a water park and thought my boys would really enjoy it. I thought the Maui Westin would be like the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island. But unlike the Hilton Waikoloa, which has its water park far from the lobby, the Westin's water park was practically inside the lobby, and the whole place was a zoo. The Westin is Disney World on the beach, and the pool area is overrun with too many people crammed into too small a space. I happened to visit the Hyatt next door, and it was so serene, I wish we'd stayed there instead. It's on the same beach as the Westin. I don't think my kids would have minded the serenity and less-crowded conditions of the Hyatt, because they didn't seem that impressed by the Westin's water park (and neither was I). The water slide really knocked adults around in a painful way, which my husband and 18-year-old son quickly discovered, but it wasn't bad for a child like my 12-year-old son. However, the slide closed for the day at 6PM, so my 12-year-old had no more interest in the water park after 6PM. To tell you the truth, my husband, 18-year-old son and I were all a little bored at the Westin, and I missed the serenity, privacy, and lower price of our condo at the ResortQuest Maui Banyan, not to mention the laid-back vibe of its Kihei location, and I wished we had just stayed there the whole 10 days of our trip.", "Date": "August 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicopee, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Honeymoon at the Westin\u201d", "Author": "rebecky", "ReviewID": "UR8357987", "Content": "We were welcomed to the Westin with a lei greeting, which was our 1st while in Hawaii. We had cruised on Pride of Aloha the week prior. As soon as we checked-in we were upgraded from mountain view to deluxe ocean view! Great way to start off. The lobby looks just like the pictures...very stunning. They even had the makha's (tropical birds). Pink flamingos, fish, flowers, pools, ponds, waterfalls, rock walls, were amazing. Very pretty. We stayed in the Beach Tower on the 8th floor. We could see the sunset everynight from our lanai as well as Black Rock, the mountains, the ocean, boats, etc. The room & bathroom were good size. We bought drinks, lunchmeat, macaroni salad, cereal, bagels, snackfoods at Safeway and we ate breakfast and lunch everyday on the lanai to save $. We went out every night for supper. We did not eat at the hotel restaurants. We did eat at the Rusty Harpoon in Whaler's Village one night which was good. I brought my \"maui for dummies\" book and it gave numerous good inexpensive restaurants down in Lahaina. Aloha Mixed Grill, Cheeseburger Paradise, Compadres Mexican Restaurant were just a few. Comprades has $1 tacos (chicken or beef) every Tues 4-8p. Aloha Mixed Grill has authentic Hawaiian food. We both got the \"plate lunches\" which were very delicious. We didn't spend a lot of $ on food but the drinks yes. Every bar has the \"lava flows\" which I was addicted to. Kaanapali Beach is voted #1 beach on Maui and it is! We went snorkeling at Black Rock and saw a bunch of Hawaiian fish and coral..don't rent your snorkel gear at the hotel it's a rip-off. Walk back in Whaler's Village to the dive shop by the ABC store, much cheaper rentals. The only disappointment about the Westin was you had to rent the beach lounges everyday so that cost us $10/day just to lay on the beach. The pools were awesome. We loved the waterslide. There was quite a few families with kids but that doesn't bother us. It's fun to watch them! For the most part I booked the Westin as soon as I saw the pools, waterfalls, flamingoes, etc. I'm glad I did because we had an awesome time in Maui.

We were impressed from the moment we arrived. The valet was very helpful and as we walked through the hotel and into the massive lobby with atrium and waterfalls we knew this was the right choice for us. My thoughts on the hotel were as follows: Rooms: Very nice and updated. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view overlooking the pools. It was a wonderful view. We were actually right next to the elevator and could hear a little bit of noise from that when it was peak times for people to be leaving their rooms. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to complain about though. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nicely appointed. The mini fridge really came in handy and we bought fresh fruit and kept it in there to eat as snacks by the pool. Complimentary water is also nice. They also gave us a bottle of champagne with was very sweet of them. The chocolate dipped strawberries were also very tasty. Food: We ate at the poolside caf\u00c3\u00a9, the Ono Bar and Grill, the main restaurant, Tropico , and had room service. The poolside caf\u00c3\u00a9 actually had amazing appetizers and the prices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. Order the thai chicken wings- they are soooo good. Tropico was decent but definitely not the best food we had on the island. It was about $150.00 for the two of us and neither of us was super impressed but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave the hotel it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bad option. Room service was okay but they charge a room service fee that is a tad much and it was very quick. The hotel: Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful. We spent some time in the Hyatt because we had to make an emergency trip to a doctor, and his office was actually in the Hyatt. The Hyatt could not compare to the Westin. But if you need a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the guy in the Hyatt was fabulous. Took care of an ear infection right away! Anywho, the tropical birds and rushing waterfall are nice additions to the hotel and the pools are so beautiful. There are a lot of kids, but there is enough room that you can have your own space. The beach in front of the hotel was great. Not too good for snorkeling but swimming and splashing around was good times. Service: Okay, so here is the downfall of our trip. We had come back from a beautiful dinner one night and opened the door to our room. It smelled so bad! We checked everywhere in the room and could not figure out where it was coming from. It was so bad that while we were on the phone with the service desk we had to sit out on the balcony with the door closed! I was on hold with the front desk for a half hour and was finally rudely told that a housekeeper was going to come up. What in the world were they going to do?! She came up but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where it was coming from. That was it, we walked down to the front and requested a manager. We waited until she came back to the room with us. Her face said it all when she opened the door to our room. It was disgusting. It basically smelled like tons of raw sewage. My husband had to get on his hands and knees and smell around the room and noticed that it seemed to be coming from under the door that was adjoining to ours. The manager said that they could not by law open the door, but she went and knocked on the door. Long story short\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the people next door did not speak English and when their entire bathtub, toilet and sink backed up, spilling raw sewage all over the hotel room, they decided to just sit in the room with it instead of calling the front desk. The Westin ended up asking us to be out of our room for almost 1 hour so they could do an air treatment to get rid of the smell and clean up the room next to ours. I was pretty disgusted by this and we asked to be changed to a different room, but the entire hotel according to them was booked. So, they ended up paying for two nights of our trip and giving us other credits to the hotel and restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which admittedly was very generous of them. It was a gross night, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let it ruin our trip.

We stayed from July 12-July 20. We had two rooms in the beach tower, 6th floor. We were orginally booked for partial ocean view rooms, but upon check-in, I mentioned that we were there celebrating my birthday and we were upgraded to deluxe ocean view rooms. Our rooms faced the pool area but we also had wonderful views of the ocean/beach and mountains! Our overall impression with the hotel is that is they orginally put a lot of money into it (landscaping is impressive) and all it needs now is some updating. Our rooms were good sized, had large closets and a decent size bath. Two sinks would have been a nice upgrade. The beds were terrrific and we did not have any noise problems at all. The carpet looked newer but needed to be cleaned. Yes, if you leave the balconey door open you can hear the waterfalls and ocean, but that is part of the Hawaii experience! I never heard a sound from any rooms or outside once the sliding doors were closed. The pools were great...the adult only is a nice break from the smaller children and there are lots, but that did not bother us. It is a great deal for families as the kids eat free. We all enjoyed the water slide and waterfalls. The beach at the Westin is much better than at the Hyatt, but I agree that the Hyatt is in better shape. The cost of staying there is much higher though, too. I guess it all depends on what you are there for...we just wanted a nice beach vacation and the Westin certainly meet our needs! The food costs are high, but one needs to expect that anywhere in Hawaii is going to be expensive to eat. We ate at Whaler's Village (Hula Grill and The Rusty Harpoon), twice in Lahaina (Kimo's (was really good) and once at Tropica at the hotel (which I think was the best meal..beautiful sunset views) and at a great burger place called Johnny's which is down near the golf course by the Hyatt. Johnny's is not air-conditioned but had great food for reasonable prices. We also ate at the Sheraton by the pool. Plan to spend $$$ to eat :) Our average dinner bill was close to $200.00 for the 5 of us. Breakfast buffet was $25.00 per person...I believe they offer a package that includes breakfast, get it if you can! We ate breakfast at Whaler's village most days or ordered off the menu. I could never eat $25.00 worth of food for breakfast! Lunch was anywhere from 7.00 to $15.00 per person depending of what you ordered. We bought snacks and soft drinks from the ABC store. Our rooms had mini-fridges which was great for keeping stuff in. The weather was perfect everyday. My husband and boys golfed twice and went diving right from the beach. My daughter and I had massages at the Westin Spa. The hot stone massage is the best I have ever had! We did the luau at the Sheraton....it was just so-so. I would not recommend it, although one of our sons was picked to dance on stage, so that was fun! We have been to the Old Lahaina luau and that is really the best one. All in all a great experience and I would stay at this Westin again in a hearbeat!

We decided to go because of the incredible price for the 5 day/4 night stay. Because there were five of us, we had a rollaway bed placed in between the two queen size beds which really made things tight in an already tiny room. We ended up spending quite a bit of time in the rooms because our children need a lot of \"down time\" between structured activities. Games were played on the beds because there was not adequate floor space. There is no table. I had the kids eating on the counter in the sink area, or on a cooler at the foot of the bed. TIMESHARE STUFF: We did attend the timeshare presentation and got the extra $100. Our personal conceirge (the one who first initiates and schedules you for a timeshare appointment) was Candice and I would highly recommend her. She had excellent suggestions for what to do with children. She was also funny and nice and we enjoyed the hour or so we spent with her getting her suggestions for what to do on our visit. The Westin offers a free kids camp for two children so you can attend the presentation. My kids did not want to go to the camp, but we were assured there would be lots of stuff for our kids to do during the presentation because the staff is used to handling kids. In reality, there was nothing for our kids to do and they were quite bored with most of the time spent there. It would be good if they offered some distraction for different age levels. The presentation was low-key and the visit to the villas was fun. My kids enjoyed looking at the models. No, we did not buy! THE ROOM: Yes, it is small!!! Candice had explained it was built 30+ years ago by the japanese, and they had been designed on the small japanese scale. My guess is that there was originally a closet in the sink area, but the upper portion of the wall was likely removed to create a counter top, and the closet was converted to an area for coffee pot, cups, and more counter space. The wardrobe closet and the drawer space (including the desk drawers) were adequate for the five of us. My husband went to Safeway several times, and we did end up eating food that we stored in the tiny refrigerator. THE BATHROOM: Yuck!!! Old and tiny! They try to make up for it with the shower heads. When I heard about the \"Westin Shower\", I thought I was in for a spa-type bathroom. No such luck! The \"Westin Shower\" must refer to the shower heads........ they put in two of them and turn up the water pressure more than I am used to in hotel showers. At other hotels, with their low water pressure, I never feel like I am totally removing the shampoo from my hair. Not a problem with the two shower heads. They also use the curved shower rod so you don't constantly touch the shower curtain with your arm while showering. BREAKFAST BUFFET: I took two of my children to the breakfast buffet one morning. It really is fabulous, especially if you are a meat eater. The eggs benedict were yummy. You can also get made to order omelettes. It was pricey ($25) but my first child was free and the second child was $12. We did not eat any dinners in the hotel but did head over to Leilani's one night for a delicious dinner and a fabulous ocean view table. THE RESORT GROUNDS AND LOCATION: Beautiful!!!!! I enjoyed the beauty of the resort, the convenience of having the amenities close at hand instead of spread out over a huge location. I loved having beach access. We went snorkeling at the Sheraton, which is a short walk down the beach (Black Rock). We were lucky to have a sea turtle in the water with us while snorkeling. Having the shopping center next door was one of the best features of the location of the hotel. I had an ear infection that I did not know about until the plane descended and I had horrible pain. There was a medical service on the 3rd floor, which I would have used, but Candice, the personal concierge, asked questions of me to find out that we belonged to Kaiser Permanente, and she did some research and found a Kasier not far away in Lahina. THE STAFF; They were nice. I think the best service we got was from the bellman (are they still called that????). He noticed we had a lot of groceries, and guessed that the refrigerator would not hold it all, so he took the liberty of picking up a hotel styrofoam cooler, filled it with ice, and delivered it to our room at the same time that he brought up the luggage.

HONEYMOONERS- this hotel is very kid friendly with meals, pools, activities,etc.- suggest you stay at the Sheraton Maui instead. Met many honeymooners who wished they had known there would be so many kids. You can also bill any charges from the Sheraton to your room at the Westin. Sheraton has a great little bar area by the ocean-go about 5:30 for drinks & a light dinner, stay to watch the cliff diver ceremony at sunset. Best mai tai!!! There is a great place for very reasonable food by the Marriott. You can self serve and also order items from the grill and they will take to your table. You sit outside right by the ocean front. Open for all meals. Walk the entire walk in front of Kaanapali hotels. Nice to see all the different hotel properties. There is a nice walkway or you can walk the beach.

My wife and daughter really enjoyed the lei greeting when we arrived. The check- in process was swift and the luggage arrived promptly with us at the room. The bellman even let us in on a little secret. Use the elevators at the south end of the hotel because they are rarely used and lead almost directly to the adult pool. We took advantage of this tidbit of information often to avoid having to wait for the elevators. We had a room on the top floor of the ocean tower looking down at the Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali golf course. It was a nice view but we did not come to Maui to stay in the room, so an ocean view was not a priority for us. The room was recently remodeled. It had a nice desk with a built in flat screen television. However I do not understand why they left the little table and two chairs in the rooms. They are unnecessary and really take up valuable space. I was concerned the armoire (instead of a closet) would be too small but surprisingly it was able to fully accommodate all of our clothes. We had to ask for a couple extra hangers and they promptly arrived in a few minutes. We have stayed at Westins all over the country and I can say with confidence that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heavenly Beds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are some of the most comfortable of any hotels. The refrigerator came in good use for water, sodas, and adult beverages. If you are looking for a quiet secluded setting this hotel is not for you. When we were there it was full, all 700 plus rooms. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say the hotel is an active place, but I never felt overcrowded. The hallmark of the hotel is the pools. The grounds and landscaping around them are beautiful. The kids stay mainly around the pools with the water slides. That leaves the adult pool (and bar) and one other as relatively mellow places to soak. Also we came and went all times of the day and never had an issue getting a couple of loungers together. Hint: the pool cabana sells floats for $4. Best deal at the hotel! The pool area is right next to the beach. The beach and swimming are awesome. It is not a good place to snorkel but you can walk down (or take the shuttle) to Black Rock where the Sheraton is, there is good snorkeling there. The beach cabanas and chairs sell out early in the morning so reserve them the day before. We did not eat at the hotel except for Starbucks which was fine since Whalers Village was right next door or you can into Lahania which is only about ten minutes away. The service was way above average. Every request was handled courteously and promptly. For example I went up to the concierge desk to ask for a band aid for my daughter. The concierge smiled and got up on her crutches (I am feeling guilty now) and went to the supply room behind the front desk and got us some band-aids. In general the hotel is in an excellent location. Like I said you can walk next door for dining or shopping. There is a lot of activity in the immediate area so you are never very far from another fun adventure or great restaurant.

We stayed in the Ocean Tower on the top floor which had a great view of the ocean and a comfortable balcony. The rooms had recently been remodeled and were nicely appointed. There are refrigerators and a room safe. However, the rooms in the Ocean Tower do not have closets and are not particularly spacious. But then again, we did not spend alot of time in our room. The Beach Tower is newer and we did not see the rooms there but understand that they are bigger. Except for the very front units, however, the Beach Tower rooms do not directly face the ocean. The pools were on multiple levels and were warm, clean and nicely designed with waterfalls and children seemed to really enjoy the water slide. The plantings around the pools were beautiful as well. We would have like to have been able to hear the ocean at night instead of the pools. The buffet breakfast was very good. After two days, we learned to asked to be seated in the restauarant on the water (Pacifico)instead of by the pool for breakfast. The hotel is located next to the shops at Whaler's Village (where there is also an ABC for sundries) and a number of good restaurants. We rented a beachside cabana but you have to do this early or they sell out. The hotel cannot offer food/liquor service on the beach, but the pool food shack is nearby.

We had signed up for a Westin Vacation promotion maybe two years ago and finally got around to taking it. First, from what I understand do not go here if you have a garden view room. We upgraded to an ocean view for an additional $195/night (plus tax). The Westin Vacation concierge agreed that it was good that we had upgraded as the garden view \"is no view at all\". Room was clean, nicely appointed, great bed, flat screen TV, etc. Balcony overlooked the pool and lobby waterfall area. I think you need to be on the 6th floor or higher for best views (we were on the sixth). Also, the waterfalls are NOISY. We slept with the door open, and got used to the thunderous noise. We enjoyed the various pools. The adult pool is somewhat sedate and quiet. The other pools are more \"fun\" with waterfalls and slides. Kids were prevalent but well behaved and having a great time. Someone in another review had made a comment about the \"redneck riviera\" but I would not use that characterization at all. Sure, it is commercial, but it is what you would expect. When we want something else we go there (e.g. provencal villa..). Anyway, the hotel is well run and clean and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. However, the Westin Vacation timeshare presentation turned out to be extremely unpleasant. We had no plan of buying a timeshare going in. We made that abundantly clear at the outset of the interaction. We were told that the presentation would take ~90 minutes. I had thought we might have a group slideshow or some such thing. What we had was a dedicated salesperson \"work with us\" for close to 3 hours. Probably our fault (we were too nice). As we had told them, that such a purchase was not on our radar but we would keep an open mind and listen. What ensued was an ever increasing high pressure sales job. We moved from the salesperson, to his manager, and then the \"corporate\" manager. At each point, they kept throwing incentives and different deals on the table (only good for the moment). Most of these incentives were variations on free starwood points. We were very straight forward and honest saying that we would not be making such a snap decision on a long term commitment. When we finally walked out we were left with a very ugly taste in our mouth. Their stated purpose of keeping us as loyal Westin customers certainly was not enhanced by this experience. It was demeaning and condescending (manager's attitude). I could go on and on, but frankly we wasted too much time and energy on this topic already. Our advice: the coupons provided for subjecting yourself to this onslaught are not worth it (to us at least). It really put a damper on our whole day. We never ate at any of the hotel restaurants, just used the Colonnade Cafe for coffee/pastries in the morning. Restaurants in Maui that we did go to: I/O - Lahaina (intimate dining on the beach, music from luau next door) Roy's - Kahana (bit of a barn, in a shopping center, food was good). Popcorn shrimp appetizer, a joke, 3 small shrimp for $14 or so. David Paul's - Excellent main dishes. \"Cake walk\" appetizer - dated preparation and so-so. Banyan Tree (Ritz- Carlton) : Food excellent. Not the high-end fine dining restaurant that we had eaten at 6 years ago (Unui room is long gone). But service was delightful (ask for Robert - (Robaire) and food as well. Great dinner after initial disappointment of it not being the Unui(sp?) room. Capische (Wailea): Very good italian restaurant. Quite a drive from Kaanapali. Beautiful restaurant, sat on the lanai. For Maui, one of the better restaurants. (We live in Napa, California and travel to Europe a lot, so we are rather spoiled). Valet parking at the hotel turned out to be complimentary (not sure this is always the case). Two of the days we rented a cabana on the beach ($60). Nice and private, even though you have neighboring cabanas. No alcohol on the beach (at least, legally). Most people just went to the bar and brought a drink back. Service at the pools is good for drinks and lunch.

We found the parking spaces to be small but we always found a space. Parking and internet access are two things included in the resort fee. We have seen this at many large hotels so it was not a huge factor. The flat panel LG display is wonderful in the room. We did enjoy using the laptop in the room, especially to send the picture the bellman took of us (on our lanai overlooking the pool) to friends on the mainland. There is a kiosk for flight checkins in the lobby. We also saw 3 computers at the coffee shop so people could easily check their things online. We ate at the restaurants at the Westin and liked the appetizers and mains. The dessert list included a banana split in a pineapple half, and also a macadamia ice cream creations. They both hit the spot after a day of golf. We also liked keeping drinks in our room refrigerator and enjoying them on the lanai at sunset. The Whalers Village next door is fun for shopping and eating. Haagendazs, shirts, nice art, Hula Grill and Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are all popular. We also got our snorkel equipment there at Maui Bobs for about $8 a day instead of much more at the resorts. We walked down to Black Rock and saw lots of fish and some turtles.

I manage a Hotel in Montreal, Canada. So I can be very critical of hotels and resorts. We originally booked the marriot but found out that they were under renovation and the reviews on it were horoble. My wife does not travel much but I do, so you take this review in great consideration. We arrived on Oct 15, 2006 and were immediately greeted at the door. which was very nice of them. They park your car and bring up your luggage asap. The people are very nice and courteous, the service is excellent. The resort itself is amazing. the view and decor is beautiful especially at night. You can take great pictures to remember. The rooms are a nice, some can be a little bigger but it's all up to what your needs are. THE FOOD: I am a very picky eater, so not many place can satisfy my taste. But at the Westin you have great food, the morning buffet is awesome. I have never seen that much great food in a restaurant or resort. Everything on the menu's, no matter which restaurant in the resort you go to is HEALTHY MENU It's definitelly 5 star food and service. The only down fall it's a little pricy but all worth it. The HOTEL The hotel itself is very clean, very modern very nicely decorated. The Pool: The pools are fairly big with slide and beautiful rock decor. Water falls. In a few words, It's a very nice nice setting and just 20 feet away from the beach. Unlike some resort, the Westin as a beautiful ocean front. Last but not least, if you walk to the west side of the resort, you come out to the WHALER SHOPPING CENTER. It's beautiful, some great shopping, Lous Vitton, Rolex, Coach store.. All the high end shopping you can do and some regular shops as well. When you are on vacation, it's very comvenient to have great shopping right be side your resort.

The Hyatt has an older feel..which might be more Hawaiiana, but for the price I'd take the contemporary luxury of the Westin. Each day at the Westin, housekeeping would provide complementary large bottles of water. It was a great perk not offered at the Hyatt. The grounds and the hotel itself is upscale and beautiful. Great for wedding photos. Lots of waterfalls, and great birdlife (flamingos, swans). My favorite feature of the resort is the pool area. The tiered pool areas are so interstingly designed and landscaped. Just walking through all of the paths is invigorating and kind of exotic. And there are so many trees throughout that you have a lot of shade options when you're out on the pool decks. The pools are so attractive and can satisfy the adventure lover (water slide) and the tranquility seeker (grotto jaccuzzi, adult pool/hydrotherapy spa). They make Kaanapali Beach look blah and boring in comparison. Each morning, my friend and I would race all of the children to be the first on the big pool slide, which is sooo much fun.

We are in 55-60 age range. This is our first time to Hawaii. Wanted to go at a time when there were less people, so chose May. Weather was fantastic. We have seen such great information on Tripadvisor that we wanted to pay it back with a review. Why the Westin: We selected the Westin, after exhaustive searches because of an invitation based on our Starwood Preferred Guest membership. (ok, ok, so we took the cheapest deal we found!) Thought it was a great price at $750 for 5 nights + a rental car and $75 resort credit. We had a wonderful time, do not regret our choice and would return to the Westin and would recommend it to anyone we know. They do ask you to go to a presentation and entice you with additional credits if you go. We went, had fun looking at the Westin Villas a little to the north and got $300 of extra credits for doing it. Also got another card for 50% off future stays at Starwood properties, except Hawaii. For an hour or so, not bad, for us at least. I have noted that the reviews really vary depending on people's expectations and travel experiences. We probably tend to be less critical than many people we know. We travel some, but not a lot and thought the rooms were just fine for the amount of time we spent in them. We would have liked a larger fridge as we like to keep a few breakfast things and some drinks, but that is about it. Otherwise, very comfortable and clean (My wife is a clean nut and she did not make one comment on the room cleanliness.) Some amenities we liked: Heavenly bed (it was!), double headed showers, thick towels, small liquid creamers provided, 2 free bottles of water each day. Check in went smooth. Upgraded from a parking lot view to a Garden View right above the coy pond and the waterfall, so a little noisy. But again, we liked it just fine. Rec'd a bottle of champagne for our anniversary, which was a nice touch! All service was friendly and quick, no complaints at all about anyone. We checked in early afternoon and stopped at the Tropica, Westin's beachfront restaurant for our first drink and some relaxing Hawaiian music. Then went next door to Lelani's in Whaler's village for something to eat. Had our first Lava Flow, which we recommend, some good grub, and finished it off with a Hula Pie. Only need one for a couple, if you still want to fit in your bathing suit. The Pools: 5 pools, was really great. Spent most our time at the adult pool. We have a similar complaint that people grab the lounges early, go back to bed, go down and have breakfast and then come to the pool. I guess this is the way of the resorts, but we found it to be really rude. We wish the resort would remove their things after 30 minutes as promised. The bar at the adult pool has a drink special everyday. If you hear someone talking about a \"Sweet Lorraine\", be sure to try one. Fantastic! Similar to a Lava Flow, only better. The Area: Ka'anapali Beach is about 10 minutes North of Lahaina and 45 minutes from the airport. Quite a few resorts along this stretch of the beach. There is a beach walkway between the resorts and the beach and it gets used a lot and you get to view a ittle of all of the properties in the area. It really fills up in the evening as peopl are venturing out to eat, view the sunset and generally mill around. Being next door to Whaler's Village, you can get about anything there you need, and some things you don't need and can't afford :). Great shopping. Several really good restaurants. The Beach: Ka'anapali is a highly rated beach in many publications. The waves aren't big at all, but do break right onto the beach, so if you stand right in them, they will really rock you. Just move a little father out and you just bob up and down in the swells and it is not worrisome at all. My wife was a little worried, so we checked out a free noodle from the Westin and she just floated on that and had fun. The water is very clear. As others have said, a good place to snorkel is a few minutes walk north at Black Rock and the Sheraton, which is a sister hotel. Things To Do: At 56, I took surfing lessons for the first time from Maui Surf School just a few minutes walk south along the beach walk. You can see the waves on the point to the left from the beach in front of the Westin. This was very convenient and they were great. The waves were just right for beginners. I had a blast, altho could not use my arms for 2 days! We wanted to do the parasailing and watercraft, but it is shut down for the whales until May 15th. The Old Lahaina Luau was a highlight. Great fun, good food, good presentations and service. It is a buffet style, but worked for us. Do book it as early as you can for the best seats, altho any seat had a good view. Shopping and eating in Lahaina is fun. Be sure to see the Banyon tree. Drive to South to Wailea, be sure to drive to the end of the road and the lava flow. You get to see some great snorkeling areas and scenery. And North to Kapalua and beyond. Road gets very windy, but great scenery. Places To Eat: *Ka'anapali : Places really fill up 6-8 PM. If you can get there by 5-5:30, you will get right in and can relax and watch the lines. - Lalanie's (can you remember Hula Pie? Ate there twice and great foos and service. - Hula Grill (a sister to Lelani's) - Good food and good times. - Rusty Harpoon - Had a good lunch. Ate there for dinner and had one good meal and one so-so meal. - Castaway - We were told about this place just north of Black Rock, but could not find it in the dark and did not get back to look for it. It is a local place and right on the beach, but I think the resorts kinda hide it. We really got a great recommendation for this one, but missed it so much food, so little time! *Lahaina: - Moose McGuillicudies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Great happy hour, friendly place.. Did not eat there. - Bubba Grumps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Be sure to get their Garlic peel-n-eat shrimp. We wish we would have made that our whole meal. Their Bucket of Junk (? Something like that) was pretty good and filling. Margaritas were the worst we have had. Maybe they had a more expensive one that was better, but they did not ask us. The waitress there was simply great fun. Large line for the restaurant, but we got right in to a table at the bar. - Several 2nd stories bars with happy hours including Moose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Hamburger Paradise. They sure sounded fun. *Kihei: - Kihei Caf\u00c3\u00a9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c On main street and with all the sites we missed it the first time through. One guide book called this a dive with great food. Maybe I need a definition of dive. It has a walk-in order, then go out and get a table. I would not call it a dive. When Barry tells you to get the Fired Rice and Eggs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Do it. Great meal. Our omelet was excellent as well. Both were well above average size, so we did not need to eat the next meal. - LuLu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. This is just behind the Kihei Caf\u00c3\u00a9. We were actually looking for it when we at ate the Kihei caf\u00c3\u00a9.. It is on the 2nd or third story, but you need to look down the side street to see it. We ate at one in Waikiki that was great and we heard great things about this one from friends and family. That is probably more than you all needed. Hope we can get back soon and hope this helped anyone that is going the way this forum has helped us.

The only negative was it overlooked Whalers Village so there was a bit more noise and you couldn't hear the waves in the morning due to the trucks that would be bringing food to the restaraunts. The room itself was okay, not a 5 star room but we were hardly in the room. The one thing that others had commented about that I agreed with is the carpet - stains everywhere! This definitely needs to be replaced. We also got the breakfast buffet included with our package and if you get the chance you'll want to do this as well. The buffet was amazing - there was so much to choose from and we didn't have to eat again until dinner. Now to the best part of the hotel - the POOL! I can't say enough about how fabulous the pool was. Waterfalls, waterslides, hot tubs, adult pool, wow! Plus the pool is so close to the ocean you can walk from the pool to the ocean in less than a minute. We checked out many other pools in the area and NONE were even close to the Westin pool and many were much further back in the resort so it would take you a few minutes to walk to the beach. Plus the beach in front of the Westin had just the right amount of waves to make it fun. Also the best place to park yourself for the day is the pool right below the adult pool and closest to the ocean. There were hardly any kids in that area so it was fairly quiet. Plus you can still hear the ocean waves. Word of warning - it you want to be under a shaded umbrella you must get to the pool early. There are very few umbrellas and when afternoon hits the sun is hot. We were out there by 7 am and by 8 all of the shaded spots were taken. Many people would put magazines, rafts, etc. on the chairs to reserve them. Management says they will pick these items up within 30 minutes but I never once saw them do this. Warning - the drinks are ab out $10 but we found out the drinks everywhere (even restaraunts were around $8 or higher). Overall while the rooms aren't the greatest (they are not bad by any means - just not 5 star) the pool and beach location make this resort the place to be. Other things not to miss on Maui - The Road to Hana, Lahina shopping - there is a guy close to the Banyon Tree in Lahina that has parrots that you can get your picture taken with. They actually sit on your head, shoulders, and arms. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny. This was our best vacation by far and we've been around the world.

We had a nice time at this hotel. We traveled with our 3 children ages 5, 3, and 11 months. Hawaii is a great vacation destination for families. It is beautiful, nice weather, the people are nice, it's safe, and you are still in America. This was our 5th trip to Maui and our 1st time staying at the Westin. There were plenty of families with children at the Westin as well as couples younger and older. Upon check in you receive a lei which is nice. Not all the hotels do that. The service was fine. The housekeeping, bellman, and valet came quickly when we called. Most of the time we parked our own car. Although, the parking lot does fill quickly in the evening. If the lot is full the hotel will valet your car for free. The hotel rooms are a little above average. We had a basic hotel room. It was a little small and a little less appealing in the decorating than some hotels. The heavenly beds are always nice and the room was clean. The hotel lobby and landscaping is very nice. In the lobby there is a lagoon with a waterfall, flamingos, koi fish, swans, birds, and a fish tank. At 9:30am every morning the kids can feed the koi fish. The Westin pools are very nice. There are 3 large pools that are connected with waterfalls, a tunnel, and slides. There is a large waterslide that my 5yr. old spent almost all her time on. There is also a smaller, slower slide for children that parents can also go down with the child. There is also an adult only pool. The biggest complaint I had was that the Westin does not have a baby pool/play area for smaller children that cannot swim on their own yet. The pools depths are 3 feet or above, making it hard for parents with small children. You have to hold your child in the water or rely on floatation devices. We have stayed before at the Hyatt and the Grand Wailea and these places had a sandy baby beach area with zero depth entry. My 3 yr. old son enjoyed theses areas so much better and it made it easier for us to watch him and our infant. I have seen that the Marriot also has a baby pool and play area. We were always able to find a chair by the pool near the waterslide to keep watch on our older daughter. The Westin is very strict on their wristband policy when using the pools. Twice I saw people being told to leave the pool because they were not registered guests. You must remember to return your beach towels or they will charge you. The food was good at the Westin. Better than most hotel food. We ate at the breakfast buffet twice and at the \"grab-and-go\" food area for breakfast once. We have grown to love the big breakfast buffets that all the hotels have in the morning. Always good and worth the higher price. We have times we eat such a large breakfast we can last until dinner. At the Westin, the kids eat free for each paying adult. We realized it was the same price to eat the breakfast buffet with the kids eating free than paying for all of our individual items at the \"grab-and-go\" area in the morning. We also orderd food from the resturant that they deliver poolside. The food was very good and a little pricey. A few times we also got snacks, ice cream, and drinks at the Sea Dogs snack bar by the pool. The Westin is very nice because it is right next door to Whaler's Village. This is very handy. There are resturants and lots of shopping. If you happen to walk past Whaler's Village all the way down to the end of the strip you will come to the Sheraton hotel which is built around Black Rock. If you go to Black Rock to swim or snorkel, remember that the Sheraton is also owned by the Westin. At the Sheraton you can make charges back to your room at the Westin. We rented beach chairs and an umbrella and used their beach towels. You can also charge food there or rent snorkeling gear and buy whatever else you need. The policy has changed a couple years ago and you cannot use the Sheraton pool. Overall, we liked the Westin with the exception of lack of baby pool area. We have also stayed at the Hyatt and the Grand Waleia, which we also greatly enjoyed. A few tips, there is a K-mart that is not far from the airport. It is always busy with people loading up with food, drinks, sandtoys, and stuff before going to their hotels. Don't go to the magic show and dinner at the Kannappli Beach Hotel. It was horrible. Not the quality of entertainment that you would expect to see on a high class vacation. If you want to see a show, go to any luau or to Ulena. We also took our kids to the new glow in the dark mini golf course which is one block off front street off the parking lot near Hilo Hattie. Our kids really enjoyed that. Our favorite beach in Maui is Kapalua. It is beautiful and is one of the top ranked beaches in the country. Always great snorkeling right off the beach.

I must say, it was quite disappointing. I'll try to be organized in this review....i'll start by saying a travel often and used westin points to book this stay. Hotel Condition: From the outside, the hotel is quite dated. The lanais have old railings that don't seem that secure. In the inside, they have done a nice job with the lobby, common areas/restaurants, spa and pool area. although the guest rooms were re-done, ours was not in good condition. the valence was quite dirty, the wood furniture items were quite worn for their age (assuming they were not too old). the washroom was odd, as 1/2 of it was part of the hotel room (sink/vanity) and the other half was cramped and not clean. Service: Horrible. With the exception of the greeters/bellmen, there was no service. Concierge sent us a letter prior to our arrival, which we thought was a nice touch, however, our session with her quickly turned into a timeshare pitch. When she learned we were not interested, she had no interest in helping us with activities. Food: We can't really provide a great deal of info here, as we only dined at Tropica 1x for dinner. Portion size was small for the price and quality was not 5 star. Not sure if we just had a badly positioned table, but we were amazed by the amount of server confusion/chatter. Clearly not a well oiled machine Pool: This was the only plus. The 5 linked pools were a bit dirty, but quite fun! Overall: Not even clse to any other Westin i've stayed at.

We booked a \"garden view\" room for $199/night (they were running a special) and we fully expected to be on the 2nd floor overlooking the dumpsters. When we got there we were greeted with leis. We found out our room was on the 6th floor, so at least we wouldn't be quite so close to the dumpsters. When we got to our room (629) we were overlooking the ocean! We were so excited. There was a bucket with champagne and glasses waiting for us (our 10th anniversary). What a wonderful time! So here's our tips and suggestions... The spa - I did the sea weed body wrap and it was fine. The spa itself is very luxurious. A great way to have some quiet alone time. The restaurants - We had drinks at Tropica one night and they were ok. We didn't eat at the hotel because we felt like they were a little pricey. The pool - So fun! Make sure you get a wrist band when you get your towels. The bands change everyday to make sure people from other hotels don't try to sneak in. The shuttle - check with the hotel for pick-up and drop-off times. very convenient at parking in Lahaina can be difficult. They pick up at the hotel and drop off at 3 locations in Lahaina... all free! Snorkling - we rented our equipment from the Dive Shop located in Whalers Village (immediately next door to the Westin) and it was $25 for the week... much cheaper than a lot of other places we heard about. Go Whale watching (if it's in season)... I went with Pacific Whale Foundation and it was amazing! They guarantee you'll see whales or you can go again for free. $20 for the 7 AM tour (2 hours). We never had a bad meal... we went to the Plantation clubhouse up at Kapalua, Leilani's, the Rusty Harpoon (both in Whaler's Village), Kimo's and Bubba Gumps (both in Lahaina). We also went to the store and bought some groceries for the room. You can pick up groceries at ABC in Whaler's village or in Lahaina at Safeway or Foodtown (I think that was the name). Go to Hana... so worth the drive. Leave early (like 6 AM). You'll be glad you did. Make sure to visit the black sand beach at the state park (it starts out Waia... then about 12 more letters). It's just before you get to Hana and it was the coolest thing we saw. There was a road side stand just before the state park... we bought macadamia nut banana bread and passion fruit jelly made by some lady named Jane... they were both incredible! We didn't make it on to the 7 pools (my husband wasn't feeling well after all the hills and curves)... we'll go there next time. Take food with you... there are VERY few places to eat and what you find will be extremely expensive. We have absolutely no complaints about the Westin or anything else about Maui.

The Kaua'i Marriott had received mixed reviews whereas I loved it; the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach had received glowing reviews whereas I was netural on it. So, when I found the mixed reviews this hotel had received, I took it all in with a grain of salt. Our American Airlines flight to Kahului originated in Dallas and landed late in the afternoon. From Kahului Airport, it is about a forty-five minute drive along the Honoapi'ilani Highway to Lahaina and Ka'anapali. We didn't get lost along the way and the hotel was very easy to find. Our check-in was problem-free. However, the room we had on our first night was a \"garden view\" room on the second floor. Well, this \"garden view\" looked out over a rise, so one's entire view was taken up by the side of a hill! (I must wonder, what genius ever thought of doing that for goodness' sake?!) We stayed in this room only one night, and after paying an additional $55 per night, moved up to the eighth floor the next six nights we stayed here. The views over the pool, Ka'anapali Beach, Moloka'i and Lana'i were incredible. However, the rooms on the two floors were identical, and I find myself in agreement with others who have commented that the rooms here are rather small. This resort does have a \"busy\" and at time \"noisy\" atmosphere. However, for peace and quiet, Ka'anapali Beach is only a few steps away. While we were there, we were fortunate enough to see a mother whale and her calf in the channel between the islands, and one day a Hawaiian monk seal even came ashore onto the beach in front of the neighbouring Ka'anapali Ali'i. Unfortunately, I only waded into the ocean here and did not go swimming as the shorebreaks seemed somewhat intense. With there being no lifeguard on the beach, I didn't want to venture too far into the water. Being a vegetarian, I have found eating out in Hawai'i often challenging. However, the two restaruants at this resort were excellent. I was able to eat very \"cleanly\" and between maintaining an excellent diet here and staying active, I found myself effortlessly losing weight!! I tried the gym twice and both times, it was quite busy. In fact, on the second occasion, I couldn't find a single unused machine, be it weights or cardio and ended up leaving all together (after all, I thought why bother with a gym when you have a pool, a beach and an ocean at your doorstep?) The hotel helped me arrange surf lessons, so on my 44th birthday, I went surfing for the first time in my life with Maui Waveriders in Lahaina. I also tried surfing a week later in Waikiki and would recommend Lahaina for beginners as there seemed to be no large rock formations lurking just beneath the water's surface. (Yes, I managed to stand on the board three times, and in fact, rode my last wave in all the way to shore to the cheers of my surfing instructor!) The hotel also helped me arrange my bike ride down Mount Haleakala through Maui Mountain Riders. Being up at the summit at Mount Haleakala at sunrise is an incredible (and cold) experience. I also saw quite a few coach tours up there at sunrise so you don't have to do the bike tour to experience sunrise at the summit. Didn't get to Hana, but got to Wailuku, Kahului and the Iao Valley. Prices are quite high all over on Maui and keep in mind that the further one gets from the harbour in Kahului, the pricier things become. My local guides were advising everyone to go to KMart, Wal-Mart or Costco for purchasing local souvenirs. In the end, this resort is beautiful, but there was something about it I can't quite put my finger on that keeps me from giving it a perfect rating like I did last year at the Kaua'i Marriott. However, for a \"Hawaiian\" vacation, I recommend Maui over O'ahu anyday. I found O'ahu quite crowded this year. They're supposed to starting ferry services soon between Maui and O'ahu. I think next year, I'll stay the majority of my vacation on Maui and just take the ferry for a day trip, if not just a couple of nights, to Honolulu.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "UK123", "ReviewID": "UR7476231", "Content": "Aloha I am a UK travel agent lucky enough to go to Maui on the 26 March. The Westin MAui is a great hotel, or should I say resort. The entrance to the hotel is grand and makes you realise that the money is well spent.

Upon entering the room (Deluxe Seaview) you will find the room large and clean. A nice large bathroom with great amenities and clean fixings oozes quality. The beds are all large and very comfortable. Now the reason to go to Maui. Open your balcony door and you will see the marvelous ocean with views over the island of Lanai and also look into the hills and mountains of the island. Buffet breakfast available for a charge of $25 per head is varied and well made. The eggs benedict is super. You can eat in the lagoon area overlooking the water or overlooking the sea. Dinners and bars within the resort are of a good quality as well. The award winning pool area is made up of five pools, a 128 foot waterslide and a relaxation pool for adults only. There is superb gym facilities and relaxing spa facilities catering for everybody. Next door to the hotel is a great shopping and eating area encompassing all types of quisine and all manner of shops.

It is very clean and well-maintained, the staff very friendly and helpful. Pull up to the valet when you check in and they will park your car free of charge. We did not know this and the whole scene was confusing. They will take your bags and greet you with a lei. - There are 5 pools, including one adults only area with a spa and bar. The other pools have waterfalls, waterslides and activities. If you plan on spending the day by the pool, you must get up early to claim your loungers. We saw people as early as 6am placing items on the \"prime location\" loungers. We never were able to get a chair by any of the pools, even late afternoon. The resort has signs stating items will be removed if chairs are not used after 30 mins but we never saw it enforced. - The beach is limited due to erosion but is great for swimming and snorkeling. The beach in front of the Sheraton (Black Rock) is a short walk, very large but also very crowded. There are beach chairs ($5/day) and umbrellas ($25/day w/ 2 chairs) available for rent but are first come, first serve so you must stand in line @ 7:30am if you hope to get one. We tried 4 days in a row and gave up - they would let one person rent 2 or 3 umbrellas and the numbers were limited. We felt like they should be included in the price at a resort such as this.

We did a whale watch (incredible) and half-day Lanai snorkel, both on small rubber zodiac style boats which we highly recommend as there are fewer people and can get to the locations quicker which gives you more time to snorkel, etc. Skip Molokini Crater (about 20 other boats, limited snorkel area, overuse) unless you want to be disappointed and do Lanai snorkel as the reef is pristine and it is not crowded.

Lovely and elegant, but at the same time, a victim of its own popularity! The Westin Maui is a gorgeous hotel with beautiful, well-kept grounds -- to keep the property looking so elegant and clean with the literally thousands of people staying here each night is truly impressive. The fact that it is so nice says a lot about the management -- they do not take guests for granted, and clearly work VERY hard to ensure every guest has a positive experience. That is something rare in the hospitality industry! The rooms at the Westin are right on par with other Westins -- comfortable beds, spacious in size, lovely berber carpet, modern, elegant furnishings, big bathroom. Only one small downside - our shower head was quite unfortunately mounted at about 5' off the floor -- for me (5'11\") and my husband (6'2\") this was annoying (on a beach vacation, it is normal to shower twice or three times a day!). Other than that, we loved the room. We paid for a deluxe mountain view and were upgraded upon check-in to an ocean view with two doubles (we didn't mind being cozy in exchange for the view!). Our room was on the north side of the Beach Tower, so we overlooked Whaler's Village rather than the pool. While the music from the bars and the trucks at the mall were a tiny bit noisy at sunset, I can't imagine it was any louder than overlooking the HUGE pool area! The view north was beautiful -- much more peaceful than looking towards the rest of the resort and Lahaina. Plus, all of Kaanapali seems to shut down by 8 p.m. (there are definitely people in the Whaler's Village restaurants, but it isn't loud) and so there is plenty of quiet. The pool at the Westin is beautiful and well-staffed. There were lots of kids, of course, but lots of couples, too, and plenty of chairs for all. The cabanas are completely reasonable ($60 for the day), but we skipped it, as we always found two lounge chairs. The bars on the property were great, as were the drinks, and I found all of the staff with whom I interacted to be entirely pleasant, professional, efficient and friendly. It was such a treat!! This was my second stay in Kaanapali, and I think it will probably be my last. We were here just after spring break ended in most of the U.S. (one full week after Easter -- and 3 days after the rates went down on 4/16/07) and it still felt absolutely packed with people in the resort, on the roads and in Lahaina. I hate to think what it would have been like during the high season! We went on a little research trip to Wailea one day of our trip, and it seemed SO much more quiet and so much less crowded with cars and people. It is a bit more remote, too -- that's the trade off!. The upside of Kaanapali is the proximity to Lahaina -- there are some GREAT restaurants there that don't involve schlepping upcountry (where the absolute BEST places are -- Mama's Fish House, Hali'imaile General Store, Casanova, etc.) -- it seems like you'd have to eat at your hotel if you were to stay in Wailea. Don't get me wrong about upcountry, by the way -- we were SO smart to book a Haleakala tour with a small, self-guided company out of Haiku, and I wouldn't have missed that for the world. We got to see so many neat little towns on the slopes on the way down that we totally would have whizzed through on the road to Hana. Upcountry is so lovely to visit -- mellow, rural, quaint and beautiful. Try to spend a day tooling around this part of the island, enjoying the lovely restaurants and shops and views! Overall, I had a great time and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Westin to young families year-round and to couples in the off season. :)", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul, South Korea", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "trsces", "ReviewID": "UR7341513", "Content": "The rooms are well-appointed, comfortable & clean.

The open lobby with its lush landscaping and beautiful waterfalls was jaw dropping. We were amazed at how nice the hotel was. *We stayed in a Partial Ocean View room facing the shopping center. which wasn't the best (Loud truck noises early in the morning) and...you barely see a corner of the ocean and you have a utility deck right below your balcony. However the girls dancing on the balcony of the hotel we were facing wasn't a bad sight ;-) Overall The rooms were decent. Damp sheets etc. but that's what you get in the Maui climate. You are only ever in your room to sleep so no complaints here. *The Pools are second to none in Maui. They are absolutely beautiful...Waterfalls, Slides, Caves. however they are colder than the ocean. The kids will love them. Also you want to wake up early to claim pool side seats as they are snatched up fast. The pool side food and drink service is excellent. Expensive? YES but VERY convenient and VERY tasty.. The Chocolate Banana Smoothies are a definite must (We left with a $1000 pool side food bill) =[ hah. Early in the morning you can take Scuba Lessons in the pool and then go on a Scuba dive. *The Beach is excellent. Snorkeling Gear is provided right in front of the hotel for about $5 an hour.(Definitely worth it) The water is clear and warm..but the waves crash fairly hard. *The Hotel is VERY Family oriented. I believe everybody there was with their family. We were there with ours and Let me say that their was PLENTY of eye candy for us guys. We hung out with several of the girls for the duration of the trip. We even ran into a girl that we had met last summer in Newport Beach. *The Public internet charge is fairly expensive.

By far the most disappointing of our stays was at the Westin in Maui. Maui was lovely, and we did all the trips, overawed by the whales, fell in love with the dolphins and the pacific green turtles, but the Westin was a concrete souless block of rooms which seemed to underline all the excesses of America today. Far too expensive, the food in the \"resturants\" within the hotel was \"plastic\" and we much preferred the Hula Grill (next door) or most nights we ate in Lahaina, in the fish resturants (Opah, Mahi Muhi and Ona were my favourites). I did have one breakfast in Ono's (I think) and I sat next to a lady who proceeded to have 12 waffles in one sitting. I felt a bit queasy watching her, so perhaps the food was better than I gave it credit for. I upgraded ($700) to an Ocean VIew room, and it was quite nice to see the humpbacks breaking the surface out in the bay. The hire of the sunbeds at $25 and the cabanas at $60 was laughable, and we heard quite a few complaining about that. Nature gave us a beach and what better way to enjoy Maui than the lie on a towel on the sand, soaking up the rays. The Westin didn't even come near the Moana Surfrider in Waikiki, and much preferred the cosmopolitan mix of Waikiki than the predominantly American clientelle in Maui, and if I ever hear the word \"awesome\" again, I think I'll scream.

We had stayed at this hotel before so we knew how nice the location was and that it was a nice hotel. This stay we did have a few minor, but irritating incidents however. To start, when we checked in we requested that our luggage be sent to our room, then we left to go to the beach and have lunch and a drink at Leilani's (an absolute must! It's a great little place right on the beach to people watch, drink a Mai Tai (or two!) and watch the famous Maui sunsets). 2 hours later we came back to our room to change clothes and get ready for dinner and our bags were still not in our room! We called down and seems there was some kind of mixup with the bell cleck and we waited an additional 30-40 minutes for the bags. Nothing major, but irritating considering we were trying to get ready to go to dinner. Also, we like to sit out on our lanai and have a glass of wine and watch the sunset, the glass table on the lanai had bird poo on it and I tried to clean it off myself to no avail, and I called the desk and requested that housekeeping come and clean it off as it was pretty disgusting, we came back from dinner and it was not cleaned up. However, houskeeping did clean it off the next day. The only other negative incident occurred a couple of nights later when we went down to the Tropics Bar and requested a glass of wine to take back to our room. The bartender rather rudely said \"If you are not going to drink that here you have to have a plastic cup!\" My husband replied \"My wife is not going to drink expensive wine out of a plastic cup!\" to which we then took our wineglass and left to go to our room. I understand they don't want someone to possibly drop a wineglass and break it, but his manner and comment seemed a little over the top. Enough of the negatives. This hotels sits right on Kaanapali Beach and is extremely close to the Whaler's Village shops and restaurants. The hotel rooms are clean and well appointed. There is of course, the famous \"Heavenly Bed\" and \"Heavenly Towels\". We also had robes which were very comfy. I don't know if the robes are standard or if we got them because my husband is a rewards member with Westin. The views facing the ocean are amazing!!! I love how also leading out to the lanai there is a screen door as well as a glass door to let in those great Maui breezes. The sound of the ocean was so soothing! There a I believe several swimming pools on the property. My husband and I are not ones to sit by the pool, but the pools looked clean and well maintained. Anytime you have a pool there are little kids but none of them were running wild. The concierge was very friendly and helpful regarding recommending restaurants and directions.

It was probably designed for businessmen, as there was a large desk area across half of the long wall. The Heavenly Bed was heavenly, but my 6'4\" husband found the bed too small. There were 2 beds in the room leaving room for a chair near the sliding glass door to the balcony but no table. The pools were warm enough to get in without cringing. My kids loved the large waterslide and small water tube, but we were all disappointed to find the grotto area with jacuzzi was a cold water jacuzzi. Cold water jacuzzi?! The only hot tub was near the adult only pool and it was for 16 and older. Wonderful to walk from the pool across the walking path (3 feet) and be on the beach. If we went to the pool after 5pm the towel area was closed so we had no towel if we didn't bring one from the hotel room. The hotel was right next door to the Whaler's Village shopping and just down the street was a Safeway. The hotel room had a little fridge so we had cereal in the room most mornings.

At this price, I figured we couldn't go wrong! The resort was awesome. I spent so much time on this site before we went, so I wanted to share our experience. We were traveling with 2 kids (age 3 and 6) from Los Angeles. ATA was quite tight on space -- my husband is 6'4\", and he was absolutely crunched in coach. Book an exit row or upgrade to first ($150) if you can. When we got to the airport, I had ordered a \"lei greeting\" which my son just loved. This was worth the price. On the way to the Westin, we stopped in at Maui Tacos which was great. When we got to the Westin, we got another lei greeting and also some yummy elixers. My husband showed his Starwood Preferred Gold card and got us upgraded to an 8th floor mountain view room in the ocean tower. (Very nice.) Plasma TV and heavenly beds. Also, there are binoculars in every room, so don't buy those beforehand like we did! We soon realized we had left one of my daughter's bags at the hotel, but the Westin arranged to have it sent over from the airport (no charge!). We had dinner at O'no at the resort. Great kids menu and they had live entertainment, too. Best dish we had was swordfish in garlic butter. Kids eat free in the resort so that was a big plus. Friday, we booked a Trilogy cruise to Lanai (sunset sail - from 10am to 6pm). This was wonderful. Great for the whole family. Yummy food, great snorkeling...just a lot of fun. One of the highlights of our trip. We saw tons of whales. Highly recommend this. Saturday, my husband went to the workout room and was pretty disappointed. No locker room. If you want \"spa\" access, that's an additional $20 a day. The machines have great rooms but the gym had a horrible layout and was not great. Every morning, we had breakfast on our balcony and fed the birds. When we got to HI, my husband went to Safeway and loaded us up on cereal, juice boxes, so we could eat breakfast in the room. That represented a big savings. Sat morning, tried to take the kids to the Westin Kids Club. It looked fine, and the kids seemed to enjoy it, but after 30 minutes we were called to pick up our daughter because they questioned both her and my son about her age and she told them she was 3. (Cutoff age was 5.) We took the walk of shame back to the kids club to retrieve them. Then we went to the pools. Very fun for everyone. My son loved the water slides. We bought a delicious fresh pineapple at the snack bar by the main pool. Had lunch at Leilani's on the Beach. Hula Pie was awesome. Took a walk down to Black Rock at the Sheraton. That night, we had booked VIP tickets to the luau at the Hyatt. Drums of the Pacific. Great bc it was walking distance from the hotel. If you have kids, I would recommend the VIP tix because you get seated in front, plus get to go through the food line first. They pulled me and the kids up to the stage for \"hula lessons\" which was cute. Free mai tais which were weak but you can ask them to \"spice them up\" for you. Sunday, we took a nice drive around West Maui. We used the Maui Revealed book to guide our way and took a really cool drive around these windy, two-way, one-lane roads. We thought the kids wouldn't make it during the Road to Hana (too long), so this was our compromise. Really fun. Had great banana bread at Julia's. We went to a locals place called the Tasty Krust for lunch. It was pretty good and cheap. Went to the Hawaii Nature Center (1/2 off in Hawaii Entertainment Book), which was small but the kids enjoyed it. We were the only ppl there. Bought a fresh pineapple from a roadside stand on the way back to the hotel, then took a late swim. Got kids meals to go for dinner for the kids at O'nos, then my husband and I got sushi to go from Sensei, down the road in Kapalua. This place was PACKED but their sushi was awesome--esp their special Ahi roll. We ate dinner on the balcony of the hotel room--just pulled the lamp out there for some light. Romantic! Monday, we booked my husband and 6-yr-old son a surfing lesson at Maui Wave Riders in Lahaina. Highly recommend this! They had a great time and my son was up on his board in no time. Our instructor was named Kevin. They also take digital pictures which you can buy at the end ($20 for a CD), and that was really cool. Ordered room service for lunch which was a fun treat. Don't get the pasta, though. (Bland.) Did a little shopping at Whaler's Village. Went for another swim. Got shaved ice at the snack bar for the kids. Went to Lahaina for dinner and ate at Kobe Steakhouse (2-for-1 in Entertainment Book). Very good! The kids loved seeing their food prepared right at their table. We saw the Banyan Tree. Stopped by Star Market for souveniers--coffee and banana/macadamia nut pancake mix. Checked in for our flight online so my husband could get an exit row. Tuesday, time to go home. We got up very early and checked out by 9am, then took my son fishing down the road at one of the beaches on the way to the airport. (Bought shrimp at Long's Drugstore for bait.) Didn't catch anything but our son had fun. Our flight wasn't til 2:50, but the concierge at the Westin recommended that we check our bags in early and then go for lunch at Mama's Fish House. This is just what we did. Mama's was a highlight of our trip. This place was heavenly. Not cheap but the food is amazing. My only regret is that we didn't have more time here. If I go back, I will do this in the middle of the trip so I'm not rushed. Amazing view. Got a table by the window which gave us a great outlook on the beach and the turquoise blue water. This is also the only authentic tiki bar in Maui which was cool to see. That was the jist of our trip. I guess this is a good time to mention that a few times during our trip, we ordered pay-per-view kids movies for the kids, which was fun for them. Also, a really nice perk at the Westin is that kids' laundry is only $15 per bag. I had them do 2 bags of laundry (one in the middle of the trip, and one at the end), which was a bargain in my opinion. You can get A LOT of kids' laundry in one of those bags. It was nice to come home with all the kids' laundry done and folded. Sara (our activities coordinator) was pretty low pressure about doing a timeshare presentation. We would have done it if the kids could have gone in the kids club but since my daughter had been \"black-listed\" we passed. I thought this was an AMAZING place and I had absolutely no complaints throughout our stay. Beforehand, we purchased an Entertainment Book for Hawaii but only used it twice, so I'd say that really wasn't worth it. (Not many coupons for Maui.) I did however get an A3H card and that saved us over $300 on our Trilogy Cruise. All in all, we paid about $1000 a person for four people and that included EVERYTHING...a great bargain for an unforgettable stay.

Having read TripAdvisor prior to my accepting the invitation, I was skeptical about the condition of the hotel, but reasoned that the Starwood chain is reputable and $785 is a deal to be reckon with considering the average price of a night at the hotel. Still, I was not sure of what to expect. ARRIVAL It's been many moons since I've been to Maui and my children (15 and 13) have never been so this was an adventure. We flew over with my sister and her son and my brother and his family were hopping over from Oahu so that plan was just to hang out together and explore the birth place of our mother. When we arrived at the hotel, my son was greeted with a ti leaf lei and my daughter and I were given orchid leis. This makes the Westin a cut above a lot of hotels; Even the Manele Bay hotel, which is an exceptional hotel in itself, does not greet its guests with leis. In fact, neither does the mass majority of hotels on Oahu and Kaui go the extra mile this way. Truly a greeting with aloha! Upon entering, you are invited to refresh yourself with chilled (real) fruit flavored water but your eyes become captivated with the cascading waterfall with FLAMINGOES that's just ahead. The scenery lets know you are in a superior hotel. ROOM We were given a garden-view room on the fourth floor. Okay, this does not sound good, but the garden-view is a room with a view of Maui's mountains! Yes, I did see people and cars since I was right above the entrance, but that's only when I looked down! The noise level was not at all overwhelming or bothersome. In fact, the view from my room was great at night, especially when the island was asleep. The lighted trees that line the driveway, the mountains, the night sky, and the fresh air were things I enjoyed from my balcony. This experience was especially pleasurable, like I said before, at night when people were asleep and during the early morning hours when I had my coffee and thought of nothing. It's just a way of bringing yourself in harmony. The room is on the small side but hey, I did not pay for a suite! It was roomy enough for two teens and me to relax in. After picking our beds and somewhat unpacking, my daughter took a long shower while my son and I checked out the channels on the flat screen. Within minutes of literally sinking into his HEAVENLY BED, my son fell asleep. After donning a robe, my daughter flopped into bed with me and fell asleep! I thought they were taking a cat nap, but they did not get up until the next morning, and that's no lie! With a bed like that, my children were sleeping off their tiredness (they deserved it!). The HEAVENLY SHOWER is a show with two shower heads and enough water pressure to make you want to wash and condition your hair, scrub between your toes, shave and shave again. I also enjoyed the lavender scented toiletries, which I assume gets its lavender oil from the lavender farm on Maui. FOOD I asked the concierge for good local food, places that the local people eat at and was given addresses for Da Kitchen and Tasty. Da Kitchen is a a sit in joint close to the airport that has some ono (delicious) food that comes with two scoops of rice and mac salad (just the way I like it) and Tasty is a place to get da bomb pancakes!!! Also, if you go to Haleakla ask the local peole if they could point you to the store with \"bentos and musubi\" because if you can navigate your way to this hole in the wall local store you can buy some ono lunches to eat on your way back to the hotel. SUMMARY Stay at the Maui Westin Resort and Spa and experience it for yourself. Don't get too caught up in staying within the confines of the hotel property because there's some beautiful spots on Maui. Use the hotel to pamper yourself.

My parents travelled with us and booked the ocean-view rooms. If this is in your budget it is a must. We had mountain view even as beautiful as this was we never once enjoyed the balcony. It is very noisy on this side, and surprisingly felt like Chicago with all the police and fire sirens. We sat out nightly on my folks balcony and I can still picture the moon on the ocean. We also sat there after dinner for the wonderful view of the whales. The binoculars were in your room for use which was fabulous. Rooms: Comfortable and clean, and the added bonus of heavenly beds and linens. Food: It is so well worth including the breakfast buffet in your booking. The spread was great and the view for whale watching incredible. The drinks were excellent. I don't remember the dinners standing out and they were expensive. It was so much easier to walk to the Whale Museum Mall area for better eats and prices. Location: Excellent as we only needed a car one day to attempt the road to Hana. The bus was cheap and we used it in and out for Lahaina shopping and the Feast at LeLe. As a previous advisor mentioned this Luau was well worth the money with an excellent feast for the eye as well as the abdomen. We walked into the Whale Mall daily for local needs and to catch the bus. You can also book a whale excursion right on the beach which was fun and convenient. Pool/Lobby: Above average with a great slide and Koi ponds. Daily Parrot visitors were also a treat. Wares of local artists were displayed daily. No difficulty getting a lounger. The gardens were well kept and lovely. Beach: Rough water during winter season, but my husband loves that type of swimming. Great for walking the entire hotel boardwalk area. Disliked the fact with as much as this resort cost including the added resort daily fee that you had to pay and reserve the shaded loungers. I do remember being pushed about the time share, and unfortunately my Mom talked us into it on a cold, rainy day that was going to be wasted indoors.

The good news is we had a great time! The hotel grounds, lobby area and pools were lovely. We checked in late at night so the 'welcome' people weren't outside but the next day a very nice lady approached us as we were waiting for our car from valet and asked if we had checked in and had we received our lei's - and no we hadn't so we gave them to us then. Very nice. As far as our room: We were trying to save some money so we didn't book an ocean view room- and even without an ocean view our room was very nice, new paint, new carpet, nice linen's, including spa towels. The room was on the small side but for the price we paid, we were very comfortable and happy with the room. It had a tiny balcony and overlooked the front of the hotel where everyone drives up and the parking lot, but it's landscaped nicely and you have a view of the mountain [sunrise] so you get a beautiful sky in the morning. The shower was nice, the beds were nice. There is a small refrigerator in the room- so you can get waters or whatever for the room. The staff were friendly. Lounging during the day: We hung out at the top pool area [there is a bar up there and a waitress continually serves you and she was wonderful] drinks, water, fruit, lunch whatever you want, she was always checking in to be sure you were doing well. We read, we napped, we people watched, it was so relaxing. The views from the upper pool area are amazing. Everything is lush and green and there are water falls, and flowers everywhere. It was wonderful. There are two 'look-out cabanna type areas' that have an amazing views and are semi-private. I think it's something like $50 for half a day and $85 or $90 or something like that for a full day. Someone had booked them every day but you could check in down by the pool where you get the towels at 9am in the morning [to see if they had canceled] and then you could book it. The cabanna's are nice.. amazing views, location - but there are many places to lay out so it's not neccessary but if you are interested maybe call in advance to book]. The fitness center is nice and the spa is nice. They even had free 10 minute massages in the evening outside by the upper pool area. You just show up and make eye contact with the person so she knows you are there and then people take turns. Great massage. The hotel location was great. Outside exercise: There is a pathway along 'just before' the beach and you can walk looking at the ocean. We would walk to the Marriott every morning and they have a pantry right off the pathway- they serve great 'hot' coffee, fresh fruit [they have other food too but we had the fresh pineapple, OJ and an english muffin every morning] anyway- you can sit at tables over looking the water and literally whale watch- we saw whales every morning. It was a wonderful way to start out each day and it's a quick, nice walk from the hotel. We didnt' really eat at the hotel other than ordering fruit , or chicken wraps at the pool. We always went elsewhere. The only negative thing is the coffee at the hotel was cold... they store it in thermos' so it was cold. They do have a microwave that you can use to warm it up but that was a bummer. So for something like $12 for 3 coffees, and they were cold that was the only bummer.... There were a lot of families and kids but there is a nice big pool for families, with a great slide, and everyone looked like they were having a blast. Re kids and safety- There is a lot of water areas, especially in the lobby /open/outside area with koi, flamingo's, ducks, swans, birds, it's so beautiful but for toddlers you'd want to watch them so they don't jump in the water. [I had read where people said it's not safe]- so there is a lot of water, then there's the ocean, several pools etc. so for little kids you'd want to keep a close eye on them at all times but the kids seemed to love watching all of the animals. There is a mall next door that you can get to along the path by the ocean. There are restaurants and an ABC store where you buy water and snacks and anything that you might have forgotten. There is a Safeway down the street and there is a Costco near the airport. PLACES WE ATE: In the morning, we got fresh pineapple from the Marriott a short walk away- OJ and hot coffee. My parents who traveled with us did eat at the hotel one morning and they said the food was good- it's just a lot of food- and the food at the Marriott pantry down the way seemed much more fresh and a better selection and cheaper. Lunches and Dinners: You have to check out Mama's Fish House [fresh amazing fish and other food] - I was told that it was expensive but I thought how expensive can it really be- but it was..we went for lunch and there were 4 of us and we had appetizers, one drink each, amazing meals, dessert, coffee and it was over $340 but it was probably the best meal we've ever had. We ordered seared Ahi and then 2 of us had the macadamian crusted stuffed white fish [i can't remember what kind of fish but they will know] and 2 of us had the fish with fresh garlic and tomotoes sauteed together.. Everything was amazing! We also ate at the mall next store Leilani's and Hula Grill both were good. Lahaina has great places too. Cheeseburger in Paradise was so-so. My dad and husband who love clam chowder and consider theirselves clam chowder experts loved the clam chowder [white] at Lahaina Fish Company. I can't remember where else we ate in Lahaina but everything seemed good. Great salads. Now, on the Wailea side of the island, we ate in Kihei at the 'Kihei Cafe'- a local told us to go there when we asked where there was a great breakfast place. It was a dive...we would never have stopped there if we were just driving by but since we were referred and we love local places, we went in. The food was amazing. One person ordered your basic eggs, sausage, home potatoes, and another person ordered the friend rice with scramble eggs [amazing] and another person ordered pancakes with banana's and some sprinkled coconut, the coffee was excellent, a dive but great food. LUAU: We were told by some friends to go to the Luau 'The Feast at Lele' 808-667-5353 in downtown Lahaina. It's right overlooking the beach and you get to see an amazing sunset and sky. The show was great. The staff was friendly and this luau- you are served. It's $100+ per person but you get as many drinks as you want and food from all over and they tell you about the food and it's not a buffet line that you have to go through. It was nice. Our friends have 5 daughters and they loved it so it's nice for young or old. THE BEST OF THE TRIP: Ok, for whale watching you MUST go with 'Safari Boat Excursions' - we went two days in a row - it was so amazing. The boat is smaller so we were able to stand up and have perfect views, walk around the boat, etc. when you go on a large boat, you have heads, hat's, camera's etc. blocking your view and you can't quickly move around because there are so many people. Ask for Lorrie and Captain Dave [I think that was his name - the boat is the name in Hawaiian of his daughter ]. We went twice and Dave and Lorrie were the best crew. Much better then the other crew. Lorrie and Dave provided amazing facts/information. So call and ask when they are working - it's well worth the wait to go on their shift. 808 661-7660. We went on the 8:45 trip and saw a lot of whales both days... babies etc. The whale watching was the best part of our trip. Who knew! Anyway- if you are like us and you've already booked and then you read the not so good reviews... hopefully you'll be encouraged by our great experience at this hotel- and hopefully you'll have a great experience too.

Okay! It was a very pleasant experience. We didn't want to pay for the upgrade; we knew we would spend in restaurants, etc. but did talk to the manager about our anniversary. He put us on the 10th floor, mtn view, recently renovated room, smaller than other Westins, but we knew that ahead of time from research. The armoire and all the drawers available were quite suffiicient, and there was actually room under the beds for our luggage, and with four of us, that was a big help. The heavenly beds, wireless internet, and small frig; what more could you ask for at this price? Oh, yeah, how about a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries sent up to our room from the manager? We were greeted with leis at the door upon arrival, and no, the lobby is not as over the top as other hawaiian hotels, but very pretty with the koi pond and waterfalls and birds. Yes it was a busy hotel, it was the holidays (Jan 2-7); there are a lot of families there enjoying themselves; honestly, don't go to a resort if you want to be alone. We ate breakfast by the pool one rainy morning; the spinach benedict was yummy, and large enough to share for two. I used the work out room, but didn't have to wait for a machine like someone else did. We ate at the dinner at the lower Leilani Grill; great location, food not really memorable; lunch at the Hula Grill, goat cheese pizza was tasty and our teens said they made the best virgin pinas.

Firstly I also was a bit hesitant about the Westin based on reviews here, but quite frankly my only conclusion for the negative comments is people who are comparing this hotel to one found somewhere else (not Hawaii). For those of you comparing this to perhaps an all-inclusive in Jamaica, Mexico, etc., you cannot. You are not going to find the service level you get from third world countries, those service jobs are considered lucrative and you get the best. Maui on the other hand, is part of the U.S., so you are going to get the same type of service you get everywhere else in the U.S. from workers at a resort, average at best ! Also Maui is a lot more expensive than these all-inclusives, get used to that. What you do get however is not having to drive through a third world country to get to your resort, the whole island is beautiful and safe. Also you don't have watch a bunch of drunk 18-25 year olds drink as much as they can and yell and puke, etc.; this crowd isn't travelling to Maui. This is our third visit to Maui and the first with the kids. We stayed in a hotel in Lahaina on our first visit which has now been turned into condos, on our 2nd visit we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton. Once again, the Westin is reccomended if you have kids, and are looking to be in the middle of the action. I did not like the Ritz Carlton at all. It is in the middle of nowhere and it is a very long drive to get to anywhere else on the Island. Also the beach is a significant walk from the hotel. If people thought the pool area was crowded at the Westin, try finding room at a pool that is considerably smaller and where everyone goes to the pool because the beach is so far away. If you are not with kids, looking for a place to relax away from it all, this may be a good pick. As an SPG platinum member, we were upgraded from a traditional garden-view room to an ocean view room in the Ocean tower. The room was large enough for our needs, but we are in Hawaii, who is staying in the room except to sleep ?? We left the door open at night to the lanai and listed to the ocean. The pools here are amazing, there is nothing comparable on Maui, this was an absolute hit with the kids. If you get sick of the pools, the beach is a step away. Prices were a bit steep for drinks (11$), but this is pretty common for Maui resorts everywhere. We found the buffet breakfast for $25/person to be a pretty good deal when you factor in the 2 kids were free. I don't understand the people complaing about the selection, I am unsure what else could have been added to this menu. To echo other comments, you do have to get in the habit of the ritual to get your poolside chairs reserved by 8:00 a.m.. As the sun usually comes up just before 7:00, this was never a problem for us as we were up anyway as we were still on Mountain time. Do be wary of the \"Concierge\", it would seem they are incented to push time-share visits to the Westin's other resort, a new condo complex. They are good though, simply say you are not interested and that is that. As for parking, we were there when the hotel was sold out and never had a problem finding a spot. I will say the parking spots were pretty small, but we never had a problem finding one. In summary, I would definitely reccomed this hotel to families travelling to Maui. As for other activities we did: We booked everything through Senior Frogs and it cost us $265 Canadian for surfing lessons for two, the Royal Lahanina Luau (2 adults, 2 kids) and an afternoon snorkelling trip to Molokini. Surfing: My son and I took surfing lessons through Royal Hawaiin Surf Academy. I would highly reccomend these guys. My only negative was that I was in a class with my son and two other kids and they all did a lot better than I did ! I was still learning the basics and Lucas the intructor was moving them on to some different stances and other tricks. Oh well sucks to be old. My son had an absolute blast, especially the fact that he was better than I was. Lucas was a great intructor. Royal Lahaina Luau: To be honest, I am unsure what consitutes a good Luau, but I will tell you this is absolutely not it. Even with the two kids being free, this was not worh it. The food was terrible and my wife and I both felt sick later on when we got back to our hotel. We had entirely different meals as well as she eats only fish and vegetables and I am more of a meat-eater, so the food was equally bad across the board We were so far back with our seats, we could not see anything, but from what I could see, we didn't miss much. The only exciting thing, the fire dancer lasted about two minutes after sitting through hours of cheesy jokes by the MC and very repetitive dancing. This was definitely the lowlight of our vacation. Frogman snorkelling to Molokini: We got a very good deal on this because we booked our surfing and Luau through Senior Frogs and they own this boat. The trip out to Molokini was amazing, we saw a number of Humpback whales swimming beside the boat. I was not that impressed with Molokini itself as there was not a lot to see there. We had been on a snorkelling trip before where we went to some rocks off the shoreline somewhere and there were a lot more fish and also turtles. We had a really good time on this boat trip, but in general, if you are going purely to snorkel, I would not reccomend Molokini as a good spot.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cWonderul Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "KAHCT", "ReviewID": "UR6571276", "Content": "We were worried about our reservation with the Westin Maui for our honeymoon because of the reviews we saw on it.

We stayed during the extreme busy holiday season from 12/23/2006 to 01/01/2007. First the positives: hands down, probably one of the loveliest hotel grounds and pool areas in Kaanapali. The Hyatt (a short walking distance away) has a very nice swan court for brunch and also has a nice pool area, but the Westin's grounds are easily more pleasing to the eyes. Excellent location since it is right next door to Whalers village and both the Leilani's & Hula Grill restaurants. We paid for a garden view room, but were upgraded to a partial oceanview room on check in, so of course, this positively swayed my experience with the hotel. The room was small with just one arm chair plus two metal chairs on the lanai (you really can't hang out it in the room unless you lounge on the bed); but the room does have a large plasma TV, small refrigerator, room safe, and two bottles of water provided daily with the $18 daily resort/parking fee. Never had any problems finding parking, even when returning after 10pm at night. Yes, there is just one armoir for clothes, but we were able to place more than 24 hangers in it (honestly, how many warm weather clothes do you need to hang up?). Bed was nicely made each day, no complaints about the decor. We were able to \"charge\" two cell phones, a DVD player, a camera, and make coffee all at once without having to unplug lamps or search for more outlets. The Westin also provides free shuttle service to Lahaina (every hour, takes about 15 minutes to get there, and 45 minutes to circle back to the hotel from Lahaina) until 9pm at night. There are 5 pools (with one just for adults), plus a hot tub and a pretty fast waterslide. The pools close at sunset, but the hot tub remains open until 10pm. Negatives: yes, the pool area is very busy, and if you don't go out by 7:30 or 8:00am to \"reserve\" an area by the pool, you may be stuck until early afternoon in finding two lounge chairs together. The towel desk opens at 8am, but about 70% of the prime spots are already taken/reserved (with hats, magazines, t-shirts, pool toys, etc.) when it opens. There's a sign claiming that reserved places are cleared after 30 minutes, but chairs were cleared only after 2-3+ hours if there were only wet towels and no personal items there. The other negative is the price for food. Breakfast for two (whether the $25 buffet or the $18 waffle and $9.50 for two glasses of O.J.) invariable costs $50-60 bucks plus tip. Same thing for lunch: cheeseburger and fries were $15 bucks per person and if you have a mai tai or other cocktail with it, add another $9 per person plus tip. I highly recommend the chicken quesadillas and the Thai chicken wings, they were both the best I ever tasted (if you decide to do this for a pool snack, again, about $20 bucks for the two items, plus $9 for a cocktail). Poolside service is a bit slow, but it is very easy to order cocktails or food at the adult pool bar area. I didn't notice an excessive child problem, but if you're looking for a place without kids, Kaanapali beach and the hotels there are not for you. Try staying at the Ritz Carlton which is much more serene (and perhaps boring).

I usually don't book hotels that have a few bad reviews, but decided to take a chance on the Westin after finding out the Sheraton was booked up. We stayed at the Westin from Dec. 13th - 19th, and it was wonderful. We rented a car and was quite surpised to find parking at the hotel was not bad at all. The lot seemed to fill up at night, but if it was, the hotel valet was free. When you first walk into the lobby there is flavored water available to the right, and you are supposed to be greeted with leis (we were not, but when we were leaving we told them we didn't get one and they apologized and gave us one as we left) The lobby is like a tropical rainforest with pink flamingos, koi, and parrots. The banyon trees are also very relaxing (although the birds are noisy at sunset and sunrise). The rooms in the hotel were beautiful. We stayed in an Ocean View room and the view was breathtaking! Although, the waterfalls are a bit loud at night, but not too bothersome. I especially enjoyed the new plasma television. I must say, I expected more from the Heavenly Beds (I stayed at the Sheraton Moana Surfrider in Oahu last year and the beds there were much more comfortable.) I didn't think the rooms were too small, but the desk and chairs make it seem smaller. The pool is magnifiscent, definately one of the best I've ever been in. Usually when there is a beach around I don't even step foot in the pool. But, this pool was irresistable. The waterfalls all around are relaxing and fun to swim under. The slide is fun (and not just for kids). The spa on the higher level is also very relaxing. We didn't eat at the restaurants in the hotel because we heard they were not worth the money. Instead we often ate at Front Street. Cheeseburger's in Paradise was very nice and Moose McGuillicuddy's was great for breakfast. I was not at all impressed with the restaurants at Whaler's Village. They seem to have the same things at each restaurant. If you drive to Hana you have to eat at Mama's Fish House on the way back. It is expensive, but really good. We didn't do many activities in Maui. But, I definately recommend going to the Magic Show at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. I've been to magic shows in Las Vegas and I've never been really impressed (they're mostly smoke and mirrors), but this guy was impressive. And they never stop serving you drinks (open bar)! The lu'au at the Hyatt was very good also. The food was very good and the dancers were great! I also recommend getting surfing lessons. We rented boards and tried to teach ourselves and did not have much luck! We went whale watching too because the submarine tour was not running (the water was too cloudy). Whale watching was probably my least favorite! We didn't see many whales and I got sea sick! The raft we went on was way too small to be swaying back and forth! My favorite part of my Maui trip was the drive to Hana! You have to do this if you go to Maui and make sure you by the CD so you know where things are! Make sure to bring your bathing suits so you can swim in the waterfalls, pools, and the black beach! And make sure you pass Hana and go to the National Park.

Our room was in the shade for most of the day. The room was small but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in smaller. Renovated with a large dresser and large LG TV. One of the best beds I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slept in, covers and all. The first week appeared to be a slow time as we had no problem with waiting for the elevator. When the weekend came so did everyone else for the holidays, never really saw any children till then. Started using the elevator at the end of the hall to avoid waits. Never had a problem finding a spot at the pool, same with the parking lot as I parked by the fence, I found the spaces a little bigger there. Otherwise the stalls are very small and some people park with no consideration of the other guy. Saw one car with about 5 inches between doors, climbed out the window I guess. Food, had breakfast a few times at the Hotel but stayed away from the smorg ($25). Great omelettes and pancakes filled me up each time. For dinner hit all the restaurants by the water at the Whalers Village, great food. Along the walkway there is the Beach Walk restaurant. Breakfast was $10 semi self serve but was the worst meal we had, most ended up in the garbage. It was my birthday while we were there so my wife reserved the 'SUNRISE RENEWAL' Champagne Breakfast. We were the first ones to try this service and it was great!!! Service was personal and first rate. We paid the extra $25 and had the cabana till 5pm. Hit the Luau at the Sheraton, (same show at the Hyatt), great show and meal but the drinks were watered down big time. The Old Lahaina Luau books up 3-6 weeks in advance so book as soon as you can.

I enjoyed the whirlpool, the dry sauna, and the steam room all to myself. My wife told me the women's side was not crowded, but it wasn't empty like the men's. The massage was also great. My only complaint (not really a complaint) is the restauraunts. I felt that they were very average. The Tropica's food was pretty good, but the service was subpar. The breakfast buffet is way overpriced. All you get is basic breakfast meats (sausage, bacon), egss (scrambled and benedict), a made to order omlet, fish, fruits and other minor stuff like bagels and fruits.

The resort itself is great, the renovated rooms are small, but very well done (I dont see how famalies fit into these tiny rooms), the pools are great (if you can find a spot), the beach is spectacular and the food is mediocre. Tips: 1) If you want a spot by the pool, be sure your out there by 8:00 A.M. because guests like to throw a towel on a chair and come back around noon. (The staff refuses to do anything about this) 2) If your traveling with more than 1 child, book a suite or get an extra room. 3) Dont fall for the time share presentation. They offer a 50% off stay at any Starwood hotel if you do the tour, what they fail to mention, until the end, is that 50% off cannot be used in Hawaii. 4) If you get sick, its YOUR fault. We met a couple on their honeymoon and they both got food poisoning from Ono. When they informed the staff, they were questioned for over an hour by security and then told, you didnt get food poisoning here, tough luck. The sad part is, the couple told us they werent looking for any compensation, jus wanted to warn the staff for the sake of others. 5) If your looking for a Romantic place, or even just a quiet one, dont go to the Westin. 6) Dont expect much from the staff. Although they are extremely friendly, they are understaffed for the amount of people on this resort. 7) Definately see Warren and Annabels magic show in Lahania.

This was our first trip to Hawaii and Maui. We travel about twice a year and like to stay in nice hotels. We are also Starwood Gold members. This helped us get 20% off spa services, 35% off some food and a little bit nicer room. I've read some of the complaints about the Westin here on Trip Advisor and I won't say they aren't accurate, I'd just say they're not a big deal. Room The room we stayed in (1128) was nicely upgraded with a flat screen TV and new furniture. There isn't a ton of storage space, but we were able to get settled in with almost no problem. If you're the kind of person that doesn't care much about the room being huge, then this shouldn't be an issue. True to reports - it was probably about 350 square feet with a lanai. We faced the valley and golf course. We didn't sit on the lanai even once. Pool The pool is amazing. My wife and I are city dwellers, mid-30's, no kids who love nightlife, nice restaurants and nice things. We also *don't* hate kids nor do we feel we need to be 100 yards from the nearest one when on vacation (unlike others who describe themselves this way). There is a great adult pool that we didn't even use because we don't think that if you see a couple kids around that you have to run for the hills (or complain about it constantly). People need to stop being so snobby! The pool is broken up into 3 different sections with a completely separate pool up above that is adults only. The waterslides, waterfalls and grotto were realy cool and I never felt like kids were in my way, being rude or were out of control. We also never had problems getting a chair, but I do recognize this might have to do with the fact that we were there in Oct/Nov versus the summer. Bottom line - this is one of my favorite pools ever! Beach The beach is clean, has great waves for surfing or body boarding and isn't packed. And you can walk down to the Sheraton to snorkle at Black Rock. They even billed our equipment rentals back to the Westin. Spa We each had 2 massages while we were there. The spa staff was very nice and very friendly. I liked that they seemed accesible versus snobby and intimidating. I had a 50-minute hand/foot massage and a 50-minute deep tissue massage. Both were very good. The locker room was complete with lockers, very nice showers, amenities including a complete spa-quality shaving system, steam room, sauna and hot tub. The waiting area (a \"Quiet Zone\") was serene with comfy chairs where you could lounge before and after treatments and eat fruit and biscotti while sipping on lemon water, tea and lavender-infused lemonade. I took advantage of all this! Staff The staff was great and always very helpful. The poolside drink service was good (not great, but good). The front desk was *extremely* helpful allowing us to check in a day early at the same rate at the last second and also allowing a late checkout. The only problem we had was with the concierges. They didn't seem to know much about Maui and the area. For instance, we asked our first day there for a good place to go eat lunch and they suggested the Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump Shrimp. Now in Maui there are a ton of local spots that are much better and of course more interesting. I thought it was crazy that 2 national chains is all they came up with. In another example we asked about a play we had heard about that involved the history of Hawaii - they didn't know anything about it. Turns out it was \"Ulalena\", a Cirque-like show playing right in Lahaina (which was excellent and worth the money by the way). So I found the concierges to be *severly* lacking knowledge about just the basics. We encountered more examples that I won't bore you with. Restaurants Only ate at Ono once. It was fine, but not great. We ate outside the hotel the rest of the time. Not because we're cheap, but because we never like to eat in hotels - its just boring! Get out - Lahaina is minutes away and there's a ton of great places to eat there. I highly recommend Pacificos and Longhis for dinner. Lobby/Common Areas Beautiful ponds and waterfalls with flamingos, parrots, local birds, swans, ducks, etc. This always made breakfast fun as we watched kids feed the ducks and the parrots wave and talk to people.

We narrowed it down to The Ritz or The Westin and finally decided on The Westin because we are both Starwoods Preferred Guests and wanted to earn points for more travel after the honeymoon and because of the location on Kaanapali Beach. We were definitely cautiously optimistic about our choice due to other reviews we read and we didn't want to be around a lot of kids on our honeymoon (we aren't \"kid people\"). We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived at The Westin. Both of us received leis and our luggage was shuttled to our room. About 1 minute after entering our room, our personal concierge, Linda, called us to see how we liked the accomodations and if we needed anything. We did notice a funny smell to the room (like stale smoke) and weren't thrilled with the view (I booked a ocean view room), so Linda told us to come find her at the front desk to see what she could do for us. We were then upgraded to the VIP suite which has 4 lanais, a dining room and living room, and one enormous bathroom (1,300 square ft total).

We found out at checkout that it was $400 additional a night and they would not let us dispute charges. Needless to say. there's no way we would have spent almost $800 a night for a room and were very dissappointed that things were not more clear when they were upgrading us (be careful!!!!) The view is breathtaking from our lanai. We love those Heavenly beds! Room service is pretty good. The restaurant Tropica offers spectacular views with good (not great) food. The Spa is nice, but not top of the line. We had a couples massage which I enjoyed, but have had better. We spent a lot of time at the adult pool to be away from children and indulged in the wonderful pool side serfice. I would suggest becoming a Starwoods Preferred Guest member if you plan on staying at this hotel or any other Starwoods hotel. It's free and I really feel that we were treated a notch better because of it. We also booked our room for 35% the retail rate becuase of our SPG membership. Also, when booking The Westing, ask to stay in the Beach tower for better ocean views. The reason I did not give the hotel an \"excellent\" rating is because they do need to start updating some things (parts of our room and the hotel do look a bit aged) and because they were not more clear when upgrading our room. We did take a walk to The Hyatt to check it out. The room rates are much higher, but it is a beautiful hotel and more updated than The Westin.

Overall the hotel was on a very nice property and the beach was the best beach of our entire honeymoon. The rooms is where it was dissappointing. We were put in the old towers and on the second floor facing the waterfalls, birds, flamingos, and loud parrots. The room had a very small closet to hang your clothes and only two drawers for clothes as well. The air conditioner wasn't working very well so we had service called to fix the air conditioner. Still was kind of warm in the room but better than it was when we first got there. Overall the bathroom was to me not very clean as far as sanitary because you smelled mildew and something else in the air. Probally because the bathroom was never cleaned with the proper cleaners to disinfect. I would only stay at the Westin again if we were given a bigger room and not facing the lobby/parrots/waterfall area. The good points of the hotel is the Whalers Village right next door and some good places to eat and drink. Best drinks are the WEstin bar near the pool, well worth the money. The beach i think is the best beach in all of Maui, Kaanapalli Beach. If you choose to stay at this hotel do your homework and ask questions as to which room you will get. I think for an upgraded room from a standard room it's quit pricey and you can probally get bigger rooms with the Sheraton or Marriott.

We could use the gift certificate at checkout which was good. We charged lunch and breakfasts and then used the certificates that way. If you use them in restaurant or store, they do not give change. So you either end up losing some value or spending more if the bill is higher than the $25 and $50 certificate. The room was supposed to be a standard non \u00e2\u20ac\u201cview room. When we checked in I asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available. They gave us an Oceanside room with 2 double beds on the second floor. The other room had a king, but I was happy to have an Oceanside room. Truth is, it really wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have matter much, as we were hardly in room. But I think overlooking the parking lot on that low of a floor would have been not so good. The room was okay, a bit tired and worn. They were in the process of redoing all of the rooms. While were there, they were changing mattresses, furniture, carpets, putting in flat screen tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -- so all of the rooms should be really nice in short order. The bed was very comfortable and had 2 white down quilts on it!! Sure didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need 1 let alone 2! There was a mini-fridge, coffee maker, in room safe and the bathroom amenities were their own brand and quite nice. They had a lighted makeup mirror which was nice to have. We got leis when we checked in, and cold towels and chilled fruit laced water was in the lobby every afternoon. That was a great treat after being out in the sun each day. The grounds are really nice with lots of pools, including an adult only one. There are parrots by the patio and a waterfall you can walk under. All pools but one close at sunset. Our biggest complaint [and we knew this ahead of time] was the $18.50 daily resort fee. [2 bottles of water a day, workout room, a paper shopping bag, internet access w/ your own computer, self parking]. It really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you much, you have no choice. Westin seems to be big on this resort charge thing, we've encountered it before. Even with resort fee you still had to pay to RENT chairs and/or umbrellas on the beach! And they make a big deal of stay at one and play at all of their resorts on Ka'anapali, but the have recently changed that policy to exclude the pools! You can use the beach, ride the shuttle, eat and sign in restaurants, but no pool use except where you are staying. There was self park or valet. The self park was small and was often full at night, so then you could use the valet park with no charge except tipping. We had breakfast twice at Westin at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 self-serve place again for convenience. We also used this towards our $75 credit. It was expensive of course and nothing special. We had croissant sandwiches, fruit, juice and coffee. We had bagels and coffee and pineapple from Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village a couple of mornings that we wanted to get out to the beach fast. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a kiosk place in the middle of the village and price was reasonable. We had lunch at Westin Villas one day as we were there using the beach. It was expensive, good and again went towards our $75 credit. The place was very busy and although it was conveniently located, I don't think we would go back.

After reading several negative reviews I was a little nervous, but felt prepared. This hotel greatly exceeded our expectations! I was so nervous that a bunch of kids would be running like wild animals, but to my pleasant suprise the majority of the people at the hotel were other honeymooners. One of my favorite parts of our stay was the adult pool with cushioned chairs and a bar. There were also cocktail servers who were constantly checking on us. Getting a couple of chairs was never a problem, unless we waited until after noon to go lay out. We are from Indiana, and with the difference in time we found it much easier to go to bed early then begin our days early. The sounds from the waterfalls surrounding the pools cover up noise from little ones perfectly. I think the time of year had something to do with the fact that there weren't too many kids around. Which was great because when we played on the water slide there wasn't a line : ) Our room was in the Beach tower on the 11th floor - deluxe ocean view. The room was huge, with a king bed, desk with chair and a pull out couch. Also had a large closet with mirrors on the doors and great bathoom with big vanity space. Heavenly showers are nice!! I didn't notice any mold or dirt. The patio looked out at the ocean (facing north), but if you looked straight down you were looking at Whaler's Village and the tops of restaurants (this was really our only disappointment). We did get snookered into the timeshare presentation for the Ocean Villas up the street (they give you a $100 credit on your account - every little bit helps!). It was a seamless presentation and very enticing! We booked our excursions through the American Express travel people in the lobby of the hotel. All of it is very expensive, but more expensive through this service we found. I'd recommend picking up those tourist magazines you see everywhere and shop around a bit. You can save a lot of money that way (too bad we didn't figure that out until we had already went on a few!). Highly recommend the Lanai dolphin rafting excursion. We saw nearly 50 dolphins jumping and playing around our raft - it was amazing! Favorite restaurants were Kimo's (in Lahaina), Tropica (In westin - but expensive), Leilani's & Rusty Harpoon(right next to the Westin). One morning we went to the Ka'anapali Mixed Plate to get a cheaper breakfast buffet (the one in the westin is $25 per person). It was cheaper, but it was a busy free for all. If you don't like crowded places with lots of hungry people - I'd stay away from this one (but breafast for the two of us was like $25). We also really liked Moose McGillycuddy's in Lahaina for lunch. We rented a car, which is necessary if you like to explore on your own, and never had trouble parking. It is free to self park at the hotel, and the couple of times the lot was full they valet parked it for us at no charge. We did the luau at the Hyatt, which was pretty cheesy, but we had to go to one since it is part of Hawaii. I'd probably try to get one that is actually on the beach so it is more authentic, because this one was in a small pavillion and seemed more like a show we could see here in the midwest. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. There were plenty of spaces for us to get away and have privacy (since it was our honeymoon). Just be prepared to spend some loot - everything is expensive. If you need to pick up anything, food, beer, lotion, etc., go to ABC stores - they are much cheaper than anywhere else we saw. If there is a next time we may consider staying at the Westin Ocean Villas - because they have kitchenettes - that will save on the expense of eating out for every meal. However it is not as close to shopping and the pool area is not nearly as big. Before we went I signed up for the Starwood Preferred Guest program, I think that may have got us a room upgrade and some other perks. Like I said before -every little bit helps! Hope this helps!

We just returned today from a wonderful stay at the Westin! Now, prior to leaving, I read numerous reviews about this resort and I have to say that I totally disagree with most of the negative reviews that I have read. Most of the negative remarks are about the lack of pool chairs surrounding the HUGE pool complex. Now, from what I have noticed, these people traveled to this hotel during the peak summer months when ANYWHERE you go is crowded and in my opinion, you should expect the crowds and know what you are getting yourself into. We never had a problem finding a pool chair no matter what time of the day it was. There is plenty of room, not to mention a beatiful beach to lay on! The pool area is amazing and we opted to hang out there instead of the beach. We stayed on the 10th floor of the Ocean Tower and had an incredible ocean view. Our room was just re-done and we were told we were the first guests to stay in the room. It had plenty of room for the 2 of us and a nice flat screen TV that my husband loved! I do have to agree with some of the negative remarks regarding maid service. Sometimes they didn't get to clean our room until mid-afternoon which meant that we sometimes missed our maid service since we were napping, etc. They are in the process of renovating the floors, however, we never saw or heard any construction noise. The restaurants at the Hotel are nice and the food is good. We had a great dinner at Tropica (on the Westin, more on that in a second) and Ono had great food as well. We ate at the Breakfast Buffet there each morning as our package with Expedia came with it (which was good considering it is $25 person!) Now another great reason why we loved the Westin is that if they make a mistake, they take care of their guests. We rented a car during our stay and one night we had to Valet the car because the self-park lot is full (Not a big deal because they do not charge you for Valet) The next afternoon we went to retrieve our car and after 45 minutes, they determined it was GONE! Apparently, the new Valet kid parked the car in the wrong spot and it got TOWED! Anyway, to make a long story short, they of course got our car back and compensated us with a free meal at Tropica (which is expensive) and they also credited our account another $150 in addition to providing us with transportation on the day we did not have the car. We also made a call to the front desk to complain about the maid service and they took off 5 days of the $18 resort charge. So, we can not complain about the great service we received while staying at the Westin. The location is the best on Kaanapali beach. The beach area is also the nicest. Black Rock is a quick walk, Whalers Village is right next door. We suggest eating at Hula Grill and Leilani's. As far as things to do while there, definitely take the Road to Hana! It was a great time and we saw so many amazing waterfalls and got a real feel for the island. Definitely see the Warren & Annabelle show. It was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and you HAVE to eat at Mama's Fish House. It was our best meal of the trip. I was so sad to leave Maui. It is such a beatiful place that I only hope we can one day go back and visit!!!!!!

We never went to the pool, but it looked like most of the lounges were taken pretty early in the day. Check-in took about 30 minutes because of some error with our group booking (not sure whose fault it was, but desk agent should have handled it more quickly). The Ono poolside restaurant and bar was nice, serving breakfast, lunch and some very tasty tapas dishes in the evening.

All restaurants on the entire island of Maui are non-smoking, incidentally. The hotel is built around a vast interconnecting complex of pools, waterfalls, lagoons, koi ponds, rainforest/jungle walkways, in which there are flamingoes, swans, ducks and parrots. No other hotel pool complex comes close to this amazing place (combination of Rainforest Cafe and Disney's Animal Kingdom and Swiss Family Robinson and Pirates of the Caribbean).There is a quiet pool for adults only. One of the family pools is actually two pools connected by a swim-thru cavern with waterfalls at each end. In the middle of the cavern is a hidden hot tub! For nightowls or folks with jetlag, there is complimentary coffee in the lobby from midnite to 5 am. We sat in comfy chairs there in the lobby one early morning (all of the chairs are lined up right by the giant lagoon with waterfalls), and watched the koi and flamingoes wake up. Hotel rooms are nicely decorated, very clean, great ocean views. Fridge in room with complimentary bottled water replenished each day. Excellent buffet breakfast either overlooking the ocean or the lagoon. Snorkeling off the beach is only fair, but a 5 minute walk down to Black Rock in front of the Sheraton gives you great snorkeling, including turtles if you swim around to the far side of the rock where they hang out.

We have just returned from a perfect trip. So, what do I think abou the Westin? Since February I have been reading reviews and I think in many ways it comes to this - you get what you pay for. We had saved and planned for a dream vacation, so we booked the Premium Deluxe Ocean View at nearly $500 per night. And guess what? We had one of the best rooms in the place with a spectacular view and had an awesome time. You will find people complaining about \"garden view\" etc., because they are trying to get the cheapest possible rate and then complain when they are not treated well. Sorry to say, that is the way of the world, and especially in expensive Hawaii. OK.. enough lecturing - on to the hotel. Perfect location steps from the beach and Whalers Village shopping. Plenty of nearby restaurants and activities. AWESOME POOL and slide and great, safe, freindly atmosphere for families and kids (Ours are 13 and 8) Good policy to have kids wear a daily i.d. bracelet to identify the guests. We always found ample deck space and were fortunate that our kids are old enough to run around at will while mom and dad relaxed. The pool staff is young, friendly, very outgoing and helpful. Restaurant employees are cheery and attentive. (Especially our friend Alex at \"Ono\".) On site coordinators for Parasailing and all other activities. We had no intention of doing a timeshare, so, guess what, we didn't subject ourselves to the 3 hours just to get some voucher or discount. (I must say, in all of my experience of resort properties, the timeshare folks here were pleasant and NEVER pushed us to stop and hear the pitch.) Room - I'm told the \"Beach Tower\" is newer and has the nicer rooms. That is where we had our top floor room and it was quite nice. Small refrigerator was included, along with a nice lanai overlooking the pool and beach. The Westin is kind enough to provide a small set of binoculars for use during your stay. A word of caution to the many honeymooners - close your curtains !!! My wife and I were witness to a few romantic interludes. My only complaint on the room would be the bath.... compared to Las Vegas and some of the newer properties, it is a bit small. I prefer a separate tub and shower instead of the one piece. A double vanity would be better too. Would I stay again? With family and for the price, YES. Now, on our last day we toured Wailea and the saw the Grand and the Four Seasons.

We found out we were referred by someone who was a timeshare owner, and that the invitation was in the hope that we would attend a timeshare presentation and ultimately buy a timeshare. Attending the timeshare presentation was not mandatory. We checked in, and were informed that the king size bed we had reserved was not available, because they had a lot of people there from the Maui marathon, which had run that day. They gave us a room with two double beds for one night (not a good fit when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 6\u00e2\u20ac\u21225\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tall, like I am) and moved us to a king the next day while we were out. To compensate for the inconvenience (after we complained) they credited us the daily resort fee of $18.50, which everyone has to pay on top of the room rate. Both rooms were classified \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Terrace non-view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which meant it looked over the parking lot, and the West Maui mountains. When we checked out, they would not allow a late check out because the people moving into our room were already at the resort, and were being moved like we had been. I guess that is a regular thing with them, at least on this class of rooms. To compare our experience with others posted here, I will say the following: The condition of the rooms isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad. In both rooms, the carpet was off-white with a bas-relief leaf pattern, which in both rooms had small stains, but nothing outrageous. Hallway showed some signs of having luggage carts run into the walls, that kind off thing. But nothing was threadbare, or looked like it was in total neglect. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice hotel that caters to a lot of families, and shows the effects of all those kids. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what is so heavenly about the beds. The first night on the king was not pleasant for me. I woke up the next morning with quite a backache, which I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame on the traveling because it was my third morning on the island. However, I had no further problems sleeping, or with backaches. I think the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heavenly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tag comes from the beds looking so plush with all those covers and pillows, which you mostly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use in a tropical location like that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read comments here that the maid service didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything except make the bed. But the maids did everything that maids do in a hotel. They put in clean towels, replaced glasses that were dirty, etc. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean up my clothes off the floor or anything like that, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not their job. The pools are great. I think the temperature was just right, which was probably about 80 degrees. I heard one older woman (in her 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) complain about the water being too cold, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 52 and loved it. And the slide is terrific! You can go really fast if you try to arch your back as you go down, and ride on your heels and shoulders. You will think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to come flying out on the curves, but you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. But lots of people go slower by sitting up instead of laying down. We never had any problem getting lounge chairs by the pool, even two together. And we had no problem with kids around the pools either. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure in both cases this is because we went two weeks after Labor Day, when school-age children are back in school. Lots of young couples with infants, however. We found no attitude problems with the staff, but then we never got abusive or even testy with them either. I think most of those reported problems come from tourists who come in, after paying rack rates, and start screaming when everything isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perfect because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so expensive. When we complained about having a reduced room the first night and having to move, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abusive. We just called our assigned concierge and expressed our unhappiness. Do see Warren and Annabelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magic show. The magic is standard sleight-of-hand stuff, very well done. But what makes it great is the patter- Warren is hysterical! And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not afraid of hecklers, he actually encourages you to comment. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy the dinner package- you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit at a dinner table, you sit at a cocktail table, and have to hold the dinner plate on your lap. And the food is only OK, you can find much better food in Lahaina than this. Do try parasailing. It was definitely a highlight of our trip. We went with Maui Parasail, which operates out of Lahaina, and it was great. The parachute is a big \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have a nice day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd face, great for photos. DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T do the timeshare presentation at the Westin! They tell you it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different than a timeshare, and that the presentation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the same, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no difference that I can see. We ended up signing, and were never told that there was a 7-day cancellation window, and you really have to look for it in the contracts. We were lucky and did the presentation at the end of the week, so when the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paradise syndrome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wore off, and we realized that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any more debt right now, we still had time to cancel. I feel sorry for the people that sign up at the beginning of their vacation, and have no window left to cancel when they get home and the bliss wears off. But when we started emailing our salesman, and the corporate office to make sure where to send our cancellation, no one responded. The contract doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even provide a fax number, we had to use Fed-ex. I believe they have had several complaints to the Better Business Bureau. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, the property they showed us was great, and if you want a Maui timeshare, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to pay developer prices, this is top of the line. Just hold out to get the best deal before you say yes. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not really looking for a timeshare, save yourself a lot of hassle and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just say no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the presentation. The timeshare experience soured the whole vacation a little bit. Overall, I'd go again at that price, but I'd never attend the timeshare presentation.

We arrived late at night to dicover that, as we'd hoped (we were on honeymoon) they had upgraded our room to an ocean view (we had booked a partial ocean). However, the new room had 2 queen-sized beds instead of the requested king, this was compensated by a free lunch token worth 45 dollars each, and also by daily buffet breakfast, which we hadn't expected. The room was ok, clean and spacious enough, the bed was comfy, nice view over the ocean and whalers village. The bathroom was what you might expect in a 3 star at best, but it all functioned well. An irritating inconvenience was not having a bedside lamp on my side of the bed, or a light switch nearby to control the main lights. Eating options included the Ono bar and grill (nice pupus), and the Tropica which had a great wine list and gorgeous seafood, we only went there on our last night and regretted not visiting sooner. The room service took around 45 mins but the burger was fantastic. The hotel sits right next to the Whalers village shops and restaurant centre, giving another 3-4 restaurant options (leilani's on the beach, sit upstairs for the good stuff) plus some nice shops for browsing e.g. Tiffanys, Louis Vuitton, Quiksilver and ABC. The landscaped pool area looks lovely with multiple waterfalls and pools. Adults can escape the children by going the the upper level, no under 16's. The hotel is one of a line of big resort hotels on Ka'anapaali beach, and the restaurants and bars are available to all. A daily stealth tax of $18 per day adds to your expenses. This is supposedly to cover the cost of such necessities as faxing and self-parking, however, in the week we were there, the carpark always claimed to be full, which meant that we had to valet park, which was $10 per day (this was not advertsied anywhere as far as I could see). Overall the Westin was a great base to see Maui, nice but not over-the-top.

It was everything we had hoped for and more. DO NOT worry about the negative reviews, it is a great hotel! When you book, make sure you include the buffet-breakfast in your hotel rate....trust me, its worth it!! Here is the truth: the Westin is the best hotel on Kaanapali beach. Not because of the rooms (they are ok but nothing fancy...who cares anyways, you spend so little time in it!) but because of their location, their portion of the beach and their swimming pools! The location right next door to Whalers Village is a HUGE plus because you have quick access to all the nice restaurants but also the quick & cheap food courts and the ABC store where you will find yourself buying almost everything. The swimming pools are just fantastic! 5 pools all connected in some way plus the water-slide which is actually pretty fast. Some people have said that they couldnt get a chair around the pools unless they got up very early in the morning....well, we never got to the pool before 10h30AM and never had any problems finding 2 chairs. In fact, there were TONS of chairs available at anytime during the day! I also recommend going to the Westin at the beginning of a school semester because this will minimize the number of kids around the pools. We were there at the beginning of September and there were hardly any kids!! I would definitely go back to the Westin if I were to return to Maui. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: - rent a car while you're in Maui....with so many things to see, you definitely need one. - read the \"Maui Revealed\" book and carry it around with you everywhere. I did it and it really helps. - you must do the Road to Hana. - you must go to the top of Haleakala. - you must eat at Mama's Fish House in Paia (best meal I had in Maui). - you must go see \"Warren & Annabelles Magic Show\" in Lahaina.", "Date": "September 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ewilde", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return to Maui\u201d", "Author": "ewilde", "ReviewID": "UR5804666", "Content": "We spent our honeymoon at the Westin in Maui - it was fantastic and we can't wait to go back.

It was expensive at 25 per person, but there was SO much to eat (and it was great after the long flight). We didn't do this every day - there is a stand with pastries that we bought from the other days. -The pools were awesome - and my husband loved the waterslide. I thought it would be kids-only using the waterslide, but there were a lot of adults using the bigger one. -Our room was in the beach tower facing Whalers Village. We LOVED it. View was amazing (even though we were one of the farther rooms from the ocean). The room was bigger than the ones in the other tower, and had a full closet. It was clean and nicely maintained. And had plenty of room (bathroom was good sized too). DIdn't notice too much noise from Whalers Village. -SO nice to be nice to Whalers Village. We enjoyed Leilani's and the Rusty Harpoon for meals. We did the food court a few times too - it's nothing special, but gives your credit cards a much-deserved break. -Close to Lahaina - we loved going to Lahaina. Tons of neat shops, souvenir stores, drug stores for snacks, water, gatorade. -The daily hotel fee (which I read a lot of people complain about) covers self-parking, 2 bottles of water daily, internet in the room (if you happen to have your laptop - we forgot it). We didn't think it was too unreasonable. Things that we were not impressed with: -Self parking - there is not very much of it. It is hard to get a spot unless you come back in the middle of the afternoon or before dinner as more people are gone during the days. It is impossible to find spots if you are coming back from dinner. Luckily, if the lot if full, they will valet your car for free. -Housekeeping - they didn't come until late afternoon (like 5), and somedays did not come at all. We didn't want to remind them, as they did such a poor job anyways. They barely pulled the covers up on the bed (see picture attached). I am a frequent business traveler, and was appalled at the maid service. They forgot to take dirty towels on the ground by the sink, and didn't pick anything up. Overall, the Westin was great - there were a few downfalls, but nothing that would prevent us from coming back.

We also attended the timeshare presentation and got another $100 voucher. Because we paid so little, we had very low expectations (especially after reading some of the terrrible reviews on Tripadvisor) and didn't feel too bad when they stuck us in the worst possible room (2nd floor overlooking the valet parking stop). My sister-in-law's family, on the other hand, paid almost $400 per night through Costco and couldn't have been more disappointed. The first room they got was moldy and they got moved to a slightly better room. The property is pretty old -- rooms look like they were built in the late 70's or early 80's -- and small. If you pay for an Ocean view room, the views will be amazing, but you will still have a small, outdated room. We noticed that the carpets had stains, the grounds were clean, but not immaculate, and the hotel overall feels a notch down from other Westin properties. If you have kids, take a wetsuit because the pools are pretty cold and they won't be able to stay in there all day. Also, there is no kiddie-pool, so if you have any kids that can't swim, you'll have to stick by their side all day. The beach has a steep drop-off that creates a rip tide, so is not very safe for small children. It was also very difficult to get a pool-side chair because they were all \"reserved\" with towels, newspapers, etc. by about 8:00am. Despite the stated hotel policy that you can't reserve the chairs for more than 30 minutes, everyone was doing it and getting away with it. We usually tried to go sight-seeing in the mornings and went to the pool after 3pm when some of the chairs started opening back up. Forget about getting a chair under the few umbrellas ... these were usually taken by 6:00am and occupied all day. Sorry for all the negatives ... but I found that the \"warnings\" from other Tripadvisor reviewers helped set my expectations and therefore helped me enjoy the trip better. On the plus side, the grounds are beautiful, with lots of waterfalls, flamingos, koi and lush landscaping. And the service was generally pleasant. Maui is a beatiful place (although crowded) and you can't really complain about being there! I would go back if I was offered a good deal. I would NEVER pay over $250 per night to stay there.

We had the mountains to our left and ocean to our right. Incredible. The hotel room was just that, a hotel room. It was clean and well stocked. The room was a little rough around the edges but nothing I couldn't live with. You're paying for location, location, location. We had a problem with our safe one day and they had an engineer up within 5 minutes who fixed the problem. The pools here are AWESOME! There are 5 pools here, 1 adult pool and 4 regular pools. The adult pool is the place to stay if you're traveling without children. My boyfriend and I hung out here or on the beach. The pool was a little chilly the first day we went in, but after you're in, it's great. The second time we went in it was perfect. So who knows... maybe wait a bit later in the morning/early afternoon to go in? Also, the bar/waitstaff at the adult pool were great too! They have these really yummy drinks up there called Lava Flows... OMG. They are heaven. :) The restaurants... We ate at Ono most of the time we ate at the hotel. We had dinner there our first night and I could not taste anything as I was sick (head cold). My boyfriend said it was good though. And the other 3 times we ate there we had the breakfast buffet. Which I realize at $25 a crack it's expensive but, it's a really awesome buffet with an omlette station (they will also cook eggs over easy, etc. for you there) and we got sat in front of the ocean on the tropica (another restaurant on the grounds)side.

We are fairly frequent travelers who have tried a number of Four Seasons, etc. We often find them too snobby and uptight, so we wanted a happy medium. When push came to shove, I trusted the Westin brand. My family of 5 (3 teenage/early 20s kids) returned today after an 8 day stay. We loved the Westin, and would return in a heartbeat. The atmosphere was upscale and laid back, the service good, and the location AMAZING. The pros: Room: I know that the rooms get a lot of heat on this board. We stayed in a luxury suite and were incredibly pleased. It was a good value for a room of that caliber and was about 1600 square feet with 5 balconies--2 of which overlook the ocean. With grown children, we need 2 rooms. This was a great way of giving us space while getting top notch views. Pools: We walked around the pools at all other resorts on Ka'anapali Beach and were far and away most impressed with the landscaping and pools of the Westin. We tried to pin down why the Westin facilities were so much more upscale and determined that it was the plush, cushioned lounge chairs vs. the plastic strip kind that the Hyatt and Marriott have. Yes, it is crowded ane yes, there are children. However, these are consistent across ALL of the top resorts on the island. The adult pool was peaceful and the hotel was at 100% capacity. Location: In the middle of the Ka'anappali strip--perfect. It's next to Whaler's Village shops and restaurants and within walking distance of Black Rock, some of the best snorkeling on the island (we saw 2 giant sea turtles within 15 mins on the first day). Black Rock is adjacent to the Sheraton--as a Westin guest, you can use the facilities there, get towels, and sign snorkel gear to the room. Service to elite members: The treatment of SPG platinum and gold members is enough to get me to return in itself. They try to place upgrades, give substantial discounts on spa treatments and cabana rentals, and allow platinum members to use the spa facilities as much as they'd like. General service: The concierge was wonderful...ours (Pamela) went out of her way to schedule tours, give us a gift upon arrival, etc. The cons: Overagressive time share solicitation--The concierge was fantastic, but the Westin is now encouraging the desks to really push the timeshares hard. They need to cool it a bit...but most hotels seem to be doing this. We noticed this when we walked by Marriott as well. Of course Maui is expensive and the hotel food was not amazing, but this is common across hotels and no more-so at the Westin. Try the Whalers Village restaurants--specifically Leilani's and the Hula Grill. They're fantastic. Other really great experiences on the trip included: Temptation Tours Hana SkyTrek--Van/Helicopter tour to Hana Old Lahaina Luau--great, but book 4-6 weeks ahead Sunset sail on Teralani--convenient, left from next door If you stay at the Westin, people told us not to bother booking a snorkel boat trip--the snorkeling at black rock is just as good!

Don't come to the Westin and then complain that you didn't get a Four Seasons experience. They are different hotels! We were last here in 2001 and the whole area seemed to be suffering a bit from the drop in Japanese tourism. Today, things are lively and busy. The Westin has kept up their property, adding palapa umbrellas in the pool area and reopening their beachfront restaurant. It seems a waste of space to me to complain about the cost of food -- Hawaii is expensive; don't blame it on the hotels! I noticed that the Westin offers free dining for kids under 12 at their pool-side restaurant if a parent is ordering off the menu -- sounds like a pretty good deal to me, and far better choice than the food court at Whaler's Village...where, by the way, vendors have become quite aggressive as they attempt to sell you pearls and timeshares. We came here many times having to watch every penny. We could have chosen to go somewhere less expensive, but to us,it was worth the self-discipline to experience paradise. It's tiresome to read countless slams against hotels simply because of frustrations due to the rigors of penny-pinching. Most of us have been there and done that; to let it overpower the experience seems counter-productive. I've only been here 24 hours, and haven't seen a bug, let alone a cockroach. I'll definitely report it if I do, but for anyone to think the Westin Maui is cockroach-infested would be disingenuous. It's a bit crowded, a tad understaffed and didn't open just last year, but we've already spoken to other families who could affford to go anywhere on the Islands and keep coming back to the Westin. It's lovely, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!

We stayed there from 8/1-8/5 then moved on to the Grand Wailea for another 5 days. At the end of our stay I almost wanted to cancel our room at the Grand Wailea and stay at the Westin but I didn't. Minuses: 1. The pools attract people from nearby hotels and resorts and they don't seem to do much to enforce the \"guests only\" rule. 2. There are not enough lounge chairs to accommodate everyone. You have to get up early and claim your chair each morning if you want a good shady spot. One day my husband and I had one empty lounge chair next to us and a Japanese family of 9 shared it for about an hour!! There were 5 talkative adults and 4 children congregated beside and behind us--it was an uncomfortable and loud experience. When they left another family of 5 came and shared the one lounge chair!! On our other side there were two empty lounge chairs that were left unused by two women for at least 2 hours--again, nothing done to enforce the no saving lounge chairs for more than 1/2 hour rule. 3. No water coolers allowed by the pool. They have a water dispenser near the pool but who knows how clean that is or if it's tap water or what. We brought a very small cooler to fit about 4 small bottles of water and they took it away from us. They kept it for us behind the activities desk but we had to walk up to them and ask for our own water whenever we wanted more. Pluses: 1. Gorgeous view from our ocean view deluxe room close enough to the ocean that we could hear the surf crashing on the shore as long as the pool and pond waterfalls were not on. 2. Excellent Service: far better service here at the Westin than at the Grande Wailea!! Pamela at the concierge desk really helped to make our trip more enjoyable-recommending great restaurants and activities with a smile!! 3. Location! Easy walking distance to Whaler's village for shops, restaurants, and a food court where you can get very reasonably priced food if you just want something cheap and quick like breakfast for $5 or a sald for lunch for $8. Also a really short drive to Lahaina for more shops and more restaurants and water activities. 4. Comfortable beds and pillows. Our room at the Grand Wailea was much larger and had nicer furniture but after my first night at Grand Wailea I woke up with an aching back and a stiff neck. The \"Heavenly\" beds really are wonderful. 5. The Spa!! The Grand Wailea Spa is world class but I had a better experience and massage therapist was just as good at the Westin. The massage tables in the couples massage room is state of the art--it adjusts and elevates your kneess with the push of a button by the massage therapist! We really enjoyed ourselves there and once we have children we will definitely be coming back to the Westin Maui but for a romantic getaway, I wished it could have been a little more quiet during our pool lounge time. Tip: if you lounge at the pool in the morning up until 11:00 am you won't hear as many children.

Lets start with the good points. The pool is the selling point in my books for anyone staying along the strip of Ka'anapali. The main pool is however crowded and finding a lounge chair after 8AM is tough. You are better off using the adult only pool if you can handle alot of traffic lateral of the pool because of the pool slides. Service was decent however it is not 5 star folks. The Westin will charge your room 17.50 each night you stay there as a \"Service Resort Charge\" I felt that was ludicrus since they were charging me 6.00 service fee 3.00 tip fee on top of that for Room service The service was average at best. My suggestion is not to eat at the hotel or plan to eat at the hotel. The restraunts are nothing to write home about and very pricey. Your best bet is to walk 50 feet to Whalers Village and eat at the food court for half the price. Remember the restraunt Lei'lanni's. Its the best restraunt in the area and its right next door to the westin. As for the bad points. We travelled with 19 family members. 4 total families. My room personally I was very dissappointed with. We stayed in the \"Upgraded\" Mountain View room. Upon arrival I felt I was going in a jack in a box. The rooms are VERY VERY small. Considering we had 1 infant staying with myself and the wife, we were pressed for space. We found our sheets to be dirty and later found a blood stain on the flat sheet. We were not happy at all since we already had our 7 month old playing on the bed. We asked them to change the sheets and they did relatively fast. Fruthermore later in the day we found the sheets they replaced the dirty ones to be food stained also. Incredible is all I had to say. On top of this the bell boy sent one of our suitcases to the wrong room and I had to walk down mayself to retrieve it. The hotel was clean to the look however the floor is very dated and old. Stains everywhere, cracks and rips along the carpet and walls made the hotel look motel 6ish. This is not what I had expected paying 400+$ a night. My parents stayed in the Ocean Tower/Full ocean view, the 2nd best room the westin has to offer at 900+$ a night. Their room is exactly what I had expected at the price I paid(400+$) Their room was about 700SqFt and had alot less foot traffic because of the location. Bottom line - If you are travelling with Kids, the Westin Maui is the best alternative on Maui due to the Day care they offer, the swimming pools and the atmosphere of 5 million other kids screaming and running around at a modest price(excluding Full Ocean Rooms) If you are travelling with your significant other, on a honeymoon, trying to get away from the \"real world\" on vacation to relax, I would avoid the Westin at all costs.

Prior to booking my trip at this hotel I spend countless hours reading the reviews of this and neighboring hotels in Kaanapali. The only advise I can give you is go with your first instinct. The more reviews I read, the more confusing I became. The biggest thing is to remember who is writing these reviews ie. families, honeymooners etc. For me an my finacee this was the perfect spot. The hotel is beautiful with its open-air lobby. Great pools which at times were over populated with children. I would recomend the adults only pool which is quiet enogh to read a book or just relax. Also, a full service bar is only steps away. As far as the rooms go, we stayed in an ocean-view room on the 9th floor. The room had everything you needed; oversized bed, interenet access, fridge and safe. The room was clean but not spotless. The actual time we spent in the room awake was minimal. Housekeeping made sure there were an ample supply of towels & bottles water in the room. We dined at all the outlets at the resort. Tropica is a great place to have dinner, located right at the beach with a great view of the sunset. Overpriced like all restaurant on the island, the food was great and had a reasonable selection of entrees. For breakfast I would recommend eating at the coffee stand, it offers fruit, bagels, yogurt etc. Eating a full sit-down breakfest at the restaurant will run you about $45 each day with the buffet costing $22 a person. Overall the hotel was a great value and was located close to everything in West Maui. It had a good mix of families & young couples which we are.

My husband, 2 daughters (15 & 13) and myself spent a week at the Westin in the Beach Tower in a Premium Ocean View room. Rooms - While the rooms are said to be small, we were quite comfortable. At check-in, the desk clerk did say that the room type did have a little more space than a regular room. We also had a king w/ a pull out and got a roll away, that did make it a little tight getting to the balcony. The bathroom was much larger than I expected. Pool - The pool temp was comfortable. If you are sitting in the sun for a little while, you will find it refreshing. My husband spent almost all day in it. While the chairs do stay pretty full, the pool never feels crowded. It's huge! There are also areas that attract parents with young children, and other that have older children so you can kind of gauge where you would like to sit. There is even an adult only pool (16 yrs.+). Get out early to get a chair, getting under an umbrella is almost impossible. The pool attendents do their best at making sure people aren't leaving their stuff and taking off for hours. Chairs seem to turn over around 2:00 so you can probably get one then. Food - Did the breakfast buffet once, overpriced. We stuck w/ the continental breakfast (Starbucks coffee & nice ham & cheese croissants, etc.) Ono's is good service & food, very fresh, nice salads, too. Our first evening there we ate their tapas menu and I really liked it. Go to Tropica's! We went our last night there. Terrific selection and great view. It gets a little windy there so bring a sweater. Location - So glad we chose the Westin over the Sheraton. The Westin is right next to Whaler's Village and we walked over there to the ABC store almost everyday for something. Great little stores at Whaler's Village. DH walked over to the Sheraton pool and said he was not impressed, smaller pool. I did not see it myself. I think I covered about everything.

Amazing since it as voted best beach in the world! When we first stayed at the Westin Maui in 1998 it was really a nice place. When we stayed in 2005 we were upgraded to the best suite in the hotel so it was nice but probably masking the overall quality of the hotel. When we stayed in 2006, we still had a premeire suite but were stunned at the condition of the room. Our room was truly in bad condition. It needs a major upgrade NOW. Carpets dirty, bathroom old and drain clogged, furnishings old. We had a suite that overlooks Whaler's Village and the ocean. It was very loud with all the deliveries to the Village. I would strongly recommend staying on the other side of the hotel. The decks are large and very nice. The pool area is great, clean and with very good service. The pool area is very busy with lots of kids and lots of people watching so my wife would say it is not relaxing. They have a large waterslide that they allowed our 6 and 4 years old to go on so they loved it. The lack of a hot tub for kids is a big MINUS. The weather was not great so our kids turned blue with cold. Fortunately the helpful staff allowed our kids into the adult hot tub to warm up. Kanaapali beach was disappoiting. The storms have eroded the beach so much that it is now very steep. The beach was covered with cigarette butts and trash. Really not the hotel's problem but noteworthy. The Westin's location is the best on Maui. It is right next to Whaler's village and has a spectacular view of the boat cruises, boats, Molokai, and Lanai. There, in general, is a lot of activity and things happening here. Whaler's Village is nice. It has basically the same stores as the Shops at Wailea but is much better. For one, it is right on the beach and has 3 restaurants where you can enjoy the view. Granted their not great for food but they're ok and have great atmosphere but be prepared to wait. The Hula grill is the best of these. They also have fast food, which is great for the kids, ice cream, coffee, and a nice hula show every other night. Lahaina is a short drive away.

We usually stay at the Hyatt and thought we would try the Westin this time. Our first impression was a good one. The lobby with the flamingos and swans is probably the nicest in Kaanapali. We had a lei greeting and there was juice and cold towels which is very much appreciated after traveling. The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and upgraded us to a deluxe ocean view room from the partial ocean room that we had reserved. We were on the 5th floor of the Beach Tower with lovely views of the pools and ocean. We had reserved two beds because we had our 5 year old with us and they gave us a room with one king. We called down and they sent up a rollaway at no extra charge. The room was nothing special. The artwork was sparse and the furniture nothing special. Plastic curtains. The rack rate on this room was $650 - $750 and certainly not worth it. The heavenly bed was very comfortable, but a bit too much bed for the tropics. For the price of the rooms I expected better housekeeping. Our room was cleaned, but not straightened up and basically the covers on the bed were just pulled up and the pillows thrown on. Because it was summer vacation, the resort - all of Kaanapali actually was quite crowded. We had trouble finding chairs by the pool and forget finding chairs in the shade unless you stake your claim early in the morning. The adult only pool is very nice and much quieter - it feels like a different resort there. The beach is nice but we were told that it was $5 to rent a lounge chair for the beach which we felt was unfair considering you are already paying a $18 resort fee. Our son went to the Kids Kamp and loved it although it is pricey. Whaler's Village is right next door but iit is a zoo. Hula Grill is nice for lunch - much more crowded at night. We loved running/walking on the boardwalk every morning in front of the hotels and the gym is new and included in the price of the resort fee as is internet.

I read a lot of the negative reviews here before I went, so I was a little leery, especially since I admit to being a pretty high maintenance, picky hotel guest. Here is the lowdown: Positives: We had a big room in the Ocean Tower on the second floor. It had a full ocean view (which was an upgrade since we booked a garden-view). The front desk clerk was very gracious. The Westin lobby is definitely a little Disneyland-ish, with the parrots and flamingoes. Same goes for the pools, which were beautiful and not cold at all--they were actually warmer than the ocean. I am not much of a pool person, but these were very inviting. The beach out front is great, definitely the best on Kanapaali Beach. We never really ate at the hotel, although we did have drinks at the pool bar, which were pretty good. Having Whaler's Village next door was a huge plus--we liked Hula Grill and Leilani's (hated the Rusty Harpoon), and we had some breakfasts and lunches at the food court, which was a great way to save money. There were a lot of kids at the hotel, but that seemed true for all the hotels on Kanaapali Beach. In fact, there were a lot of people EVERYWHERE on Kanaapali Beach. When we went to the pool, we spent most of our time in the adults pool, which was never crowded. Negatives: It was hard for us to get side by side chairs at the pool before 4 p.m. We were NEVER able to get an umbrella at the beach--we counted 13 umbrellas for the entire hotel. The beach attendant told me that he started renting them at 8, and by 8:20 they were all gone. This put a damper on things, as my husband burns very easily, so we had to really limit our time at the beach. Housekeeping wasn't great. Our room was always clean, but all they did was clean the bathroom and make the bed. Nothing was ever straightened up. I ironed the first night, and the ironing board and iron stayed out for days, the maid never put them away. Room service was very slow as well. CHOOSING BETWEEN THE HYATT AND THE WESTIN: This was a big dilemma for me, so here is my opinion: The Hyatt did seem a little more quiet, the pools were just as nice, and so was the lobby. The grounds seemed more expansive, but that was not an issue for me. No idea what the rooms are like there. For me, it came down to beach and convenience. The Hyatt has virtually no sand beach in front, and a few couples we met from there told us that they walked down to the Westin to go to the beach every day. Also, the Hyatt is furthest from Whaler's Village. Having it next door was very convenient for us, as we could just pop over anytime for less expensive food and beverages.

I was utterly disappointed in the Westin for having put their nameplate on this hotel. It is simply not up to par with the 7 or 8 other Westins I have stayed at nationwide - period. To be fair, the lobby is very nice, and in a \"punch you in the face\" over-the-top way, much like the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the big island. Lots of waterfalls, koi ponds, amazing pools, etc. But unfortunately, that's where the quality ended, as far as I'm concerned. As soon as you get in the elevators and make your way to the guest rooms, it is painfully obvious that this is an older property that Westin bought and has put their name on. The walls are very beat up, covered with vinyl wallpaper, all of the outside corners of the wall in the rooms and the hallways have this cheesy plastic angle-bracket material on them in an attempt to cover up the thrashed drywall on the corners. Our bathroom tub had a drain that simply didn't drain, and the tub was clearly the beat-up original one from the old hotel. The wallpaper in our room was peeling off all over the place, and the desktop was all gouged up. I would put the level of quality on par with a lower-priced Mariott property - not a Westin. I should say in all fairness that in areas where the Westin clearly had done completely new construction, like the workout facility, those areas were of disntinctly normal Westin quality. It almost drew more attention to the shortcomings of the rest of the hotel, however - the fit and finish on the Westin-built sections was drastically different. I've stayed at plenty of other Westin properties nationwide, and have always looked forward to staying at one when I have had the chance on business. This property was an absolute letdown, I'm sorry to say. The food was mediocre at best at the poolside restaurant, and the place was crawling with screaming kids - it was like an amusement park. I'm not saying that kids are a bad thing, but the acoustics in the pool area/lobby are terrible - it's like an echo chamber. Conversely, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Poipu on Kauai for a week after that, and there were just as may kids there, and you hardly noticed them. It was easy to get away to a relaxing spot, and the fit and finish of the hotel was worlds better. Granted, we started the trip out with a week at the Four Seasons Hualalai, so my level of comparison was possibly skewed, but even the Hyatt was orders of magnitude nicer for about the same money - and for nearly $400 a night, I would expect to see no peeling wallpaper in my room. That is straight-up Holiday Inn. Overall, I think Westin should change the name of the hotel and maybe put a \"powered by Westin\" logo on there or something, because as a standalone Westin resort, it is simply just not up there with the rest of the Westin chain.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona, CA", "Title": "\u201cHad a perfect stay\u201d", "Author": "mauijunkie", "ReviewID": "UR5373451", "Content": "Stayed at the Westin on a vacation package through Starwood since we are members.

Each time we let the valet area know and were given complimentary valet parking. (You will need to review your bill at check out as we were charged but it was removed upon notification). This was a special trip to Maui for my husband's 50th birthday and we also took our 11 yr old son along. I like the heavenly bed/bath with Westin and noticed when we checked in there were no bathrobes (a little detail no big thing but again they were brought to the room when requested). When I made reservations I selected the Premium Deluxe Ocean View Room and requested to be on as high a floor as possible (to get the best view). I also mentioned wanting to be able to view the sunsets. We were on the 10th floor (of 11 in our building). About the only complaint I have is that I specifically wanted us to be able to sit on the lanai in the evening to watch the sunset and have a glass of wine. Our room was not in the direction of the evening sun so that was not possible. I would have been able to upgrade for $257 more to a room that would allow this but didn't see the value in it after already paying a higher rate for the Prem. Deluxe. The room was in line with the Westin reputation and met our expectations. The maid even left wine glasses for us after seeing a bottle of wine sit out the first day. The breakfast buffet, although a little pricey ($25 pp-but kids eat free with each paying adult) was good. The selection and quality of food was good. When we travel we like to get off the beaten path some and experience where the locals eat. The concierge recommended several places. To name a couple: Java Jazz-quaint, eclectic place for dinner, Aloha Mixed Plate-great place for inexpensive dinner. We ate at the hotel restaurants quite a bit as with our 35% discount on food it was comparable to other places around us and equally as good. We ate lunch one day at the Hula Grill (on the beach) which is at the Whaler's Village, just a short walk from the hotel. Food was good-no complaints. One of our more enjoyable and least expensive meals was on the drive back to the airport the evening we were leaving. It is called Da Kitchen (just minutes from the OGG airport). Small, locals hang out--large portions, very good food, great service! We did go to a luau--the Old Lahaina on Front Street. We took the trolley (for $1 pp as stated in previous reviews). The trolley stops running at 7pm though and the luau isn't over until 8:45. Knowing this beforehand I planned for us to take a taxi back to the hotel (cost was $11.50). Small price to pay for not having to bother with parking or for those who might imbibe too much. As for the luau, I chose the table seating (recommended). One side of the table we were placed at faced the hot evening sun which wasn't pleasant but the sun goes down within a couple of hours of getting there. You're only facing it directly for a portion of that time as you are walking around looking at the arts and crafts and watching them uncover the imu. The food was okay (certainly didn't get $250 worth for the 3 of us but when food is mass produced like that your expectations are not the same). I guess we could have drunk from the open bar but it just didn't appeal to us. The show was entertaining--dancers were talented. Back to the hotel--our son loved the aquatic playground. There are 2 water slides (one for older kids and adults, the other for much younger kids). Each morning at 9am they have slide races and the winner gets a free huge snow cone made at the pool side Sea Dogs. They also have 3 pt. contests at the basketball goal in the pool. Winner gets a snow cone or if it's an adult you get a free drink. The hotel was not overly crowded as I had expected for the time of year we went. You do need to get out before 9am for best chair selection by the pool (as stated in previous reviews). The water was cool initially upon entering (80 degrees) and would warm up to 84 during the day. We did not venture out from the hotel to sight see. This trip was to relax and do nothing and that was what we did. We found it extremely relaxing and quite near perfect (remember not being able to see the sunset)! We figured we could sight see the next time we're back there.

TIP TO EATING IN MAUI: Make reservations anywhere and eat before 7 p.m. to avoid rushing servers and meals, cuz it gets busy!! Roy's in Kahana Center was \"A+ seafood.\" Meals at hotel are a bit expensive and not bad, but will work in a crunch. Safeway in Lahaina Center is good for snacks and lunches and many restaurants along the beach close buy, all about the same price. Great snorkeling about 300 yards away, at Black Rock.

Yes, there were some kids but I don't think it was terribly crowded with children, there is also an adult only pool and hot tub if you want to get away from the kids. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, we booked a partial oceanview room and were upgraded to a full ocean view room overlooking the entire resort, pools, beach and with a fabulous view of Molokai and Lanai. The beds are really comfortable, the room is not too big but why would you spend much time in your room anyway when you are visiting paradise! We enjoyed the beautiful sunsets from our balcony at night. My son loved to feed the koi fish and swans every morning. The food can get a little pricey at the hotel so we stocked up on snacks, fruit, drinks etc at the Safeway in Lahaina and kept them in our small refrigerator in our room and took them to the pool during the day. The beach in front of the hotel is very nice, not too crowded like the one in front of the Sheraton where we went to snorkel a couple of times. The Whalers Village and Shops next door is very convenient, you can also buy snacks and drinks at the ABC store in the Village.

Comparing it to the Hyatt I would have to say there are definately a lot more kids at the Westin then the Hyatt. We felt that we were one of the few couples without a baby or small child at the breakfast buffet. So I was happy that we weren't on our honeymoon because it is not nearly as quiet and romantic as the Hyatt was. We did find the rooms to be a little small but that really wasn't such a problem since we spent most of the day outside the hotel room. The pools were great- they were never over crowded and we always found a chair. We did the sunset dinner for two which was one of the most romantic dinners I've ever shared with my husband. Although if you do set it up (we did through our travel agent) check with \"service express\" since no one at the desk or the concierge had any idea what we were talking about. I also highly recommend the spa- my husband and I did the couples massage- poolside and it was great! There was no one around the massage area and it was nice and quiet. Also- just a tip- if you go to the concierge be forewarned that they will try to talk you into going to the villas/time share presentation. Which is fine if you want to spend 2 hours of your vacation looking at a pricey time share.

I am not sure where that came from because the resort was top notch. In fact, I am glad we chose this resort over the Hyatt or Sheraton because the Hyatt lacks a decent beach, and the Sheraton has an overly crowded beach due to Black Rock, a snorkeling destination. The Westin is just steps away from Whaler's Village with plenty of shopping and restaurants. It is minutes away by car from Lahaina. Rooms are lovely, well appointed, nice size bathroom with granite, refrigerator replenished with 2 bottles of water daily, the Heavenly bed...what more can I say? I would say the only downside is this place is overrun with children. I compared it to an elementary school playground. I would estimate 90% of guests were families. Also bear in mind, this was the week prior to Easter. It was very difficult to get a chair by the pool. The Westin didn't heed to the 30-minute unattended chair rule. However, guests took advantage of this rule themselves, can't say I blame them. I thought the Westin pool was nicer than the Hyatt (the Hyatt is ranked #1 pool) although the Hyatt has a better pool area for the 6 and under set. Breakfast buffet was excellent, we ate all other meals off the property so I can't comment on that. Overall, I would highly recommend this resort.

Our experience started out on the wrong foot. We came from the beautiful Grand Hyatt, Kaua'i, where we were treated extremely well. We got to Maui and were immediately disappointed with the service at the front desk. There was no, \"Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. So and So.\" Instead the lady at the front desk acted as though we were disturbing her. She was obviously new, but there was still no excuse for her attitude. We asked to be upgraded to an oceanview room because we were successful in having our request met at the two previous hotels we stayed at (Sheraton Moana Surfrider, Oahu and Grand Hyatt, Kaua'i). The answer was, \"I wish I could do that, but because you guys booked through a travel agent, and got such a low price, we can't upgrade you. Next time you should try booking directly through our website.\" We were shocked by this response. A simple, \"No, we can't accommodate your request\" would have been just fine. Instead, she made us feel as though we were not spending enough money to be treated well. Besides, our package was far from cheap. We didn't say much at that point, trying to not let her spoil our honeymoon. Then she gave us the keys to our room, and didn't even bother to explain that there are two sets elevators and that we should head towards to elevators on the left. Needless to say, we went to the wrong elevators. After we got to what was supposed to be our floor and realized that our room wasn't accessible from this part of the hotel, we became really upset. We called the hotel manager and told her the story. She was very apologetic and offered us a $200 credit towards the room. So our issue was resolved, but it wasn't a very nice way to start off the week. The rest of our time at the Westin was pleasant. The hotel is nice. The lobby is beautiful with Flamingos and waterfalls, it is quite the sight. The pool was always freezing cold, so we spent most of our time on the beach or in the hot tub. The area around the pool is beautiful. The chez lounges are wooden and not cheap plastic, like at some of the other hotels. The drinks are very good, though very expensive. We met a lot of other honeymooners, which was nice. There were quite a few kids at this hotel, but they weren't too loud. It's true that the rooms are a little small, but they're very tastefully decorated. Plus, how much time does anyone actually spend in their room? Overall, we loved the area the hotel was located in. Lahaina is very close by, and we went there on most nights for dinner. The restaurants at the Westin were great for breakfast and lunch, but for dinner you must go out. Maui has a lot of great restaurants. Specifically, I would recommend David and Paul's, Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Cheeseburger in Paradise. If you like sushi, there is a great sushi restaurant right next to the Ritz Carlton, though I have forgotten the name. We also loved the sunset sail cruise, snorkeling tour and haleakala is a must see. If you do decide to wake up at 2 am and drive 2 hours to get to the top of this 10,000 foot moutain, make sure you ask the hotel for blankets or bring some warm clothing. It tends to be very cold up there (37 degrees). If we went back to Maui again, we wouldn't stay Westin. We would probably try the Ritz Carlton or the Fairmont Kei Lani.

Since we own a Marriott timeshare on Maui, we are very familiar with the Westin's location, and Maui in general. Pros: Checking into the Westin was very easy, and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a 9th floor room with a view of the mountains. We had 2 queen beds and plenty of space to move around. We didn't feel that the room was undersized at all, and the Heavenly Bed was everything the Westin says it is. The grounds were gorgeous and very clean, and the pools were loads of fun. Self-parking was very easy and we never had trouble finding a spot. We had a refrigerator and safe, both of which I think are \"must haves\" on Maui. The location on Kaanapali beach is the best, being next to Whaler's Village and in the middle of the \"strip\". They offered a shuttle to the other Starwood properties so we could have used the amenities, but since pool use wasn't part of that, we didn't see the point. Cons: We opted to sit through the timeshare presentation for an extra $100 voucher. This was a mistake as it took far longer than 90 minutes and at the end the finance guy immediately began pressuring us. They started out telling us how unique their Starwood program was, but the more they talked, the more it sounded like the program we have with our Marriott timeshare. When it was all said and done, we simply couldn't see how spending $45,000 plus a yearly maintenance fee of $1800 was a \"bargain\". The daily resort fee was $18 and paid for water, a newspaper, parking, and admission to the workout facility. It would have been nice to be able to opt out of it and pay a $3 a day parking fee instead. I found it amazing that a resort that charges $350+ for a room will nickel and dime people the \"resort fee\". For $350+ a night everything should be included IMO (except meals). I've read reviews here about kids running up and down the hall. We had the exact same experience, including a family who fought so loudly that we could hear them through their door as we walked down the hall. All in all we had a great time at the Westin. Would we go back? No. We felt that the property seriously overcharged for the rooms and amenities, and we were so turned off by the pressured sales pitch that even if we had been interested in a timeshare, we likely wouldn't have purchased from them because they made us so uncomfortable.", "Date": "April 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cThought it was great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4952894", "Content": "AFter reading a lot of the reviews on the Westin I felt a need to chime in.

Excuse the rambling and detail but we need to get all this off our chests. We are a family of 5, mom, dad and three girls ages 9, 4 and 21 months. We typically book a suite or get two connecting rooms to accommodate our family. After serious research we booked the Jr. Suite at the Westin. The Westin website states that the suite is 845 sq. ft. with separate bedroom and living rooms. The confirmation we received stated that the room had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ocean views. The rate of $650/night was worth it considering the size of the room and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ocean views. After reading negative reviews here from people who I believe stayed in the Jr. Suites I was concerned about the views and size of the room and called the hotel directly. Both times they confirmed the sq. footage and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd views. Upon arrival I asked Rebecca at the front desk about our room and she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly thrilled. After I told her we were a family of 5 she thought we might be cramped. I was confused because the room was 845 sq. ft. She proceeded to show me a map of the room with sq. footage which showed the room is really less than 475sq. ft. Rebecca told me they were probably including the sq. footage of the lanai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (balconies). I asked her about the views and she said it was on the 2nd floor overlooking Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village and that it was not a great view, I was furious. She stated that she had nothing better available other than the luxury suite at $1100/night. She gave us the keys and told us to check out the Jr. Suite and come back if it was not acceptable. When I complained to Rebecca she went to talk to the manager. When she returned she said she was giving us the Luxury Suite for the same price as we had booked the Jr. Suite. It was right next door to the other room but even though it was on the 2nd floor this room did have dramatic ocean views (see pictures) and was approximately 1110 sq. ft large (not including balconies) and was amazing. The room had a treadmill, 3 lanai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all with stunning views, dining table, huge master bath and a separate hallway half bath. We were truly satisfied at this point. It was large enough where our two older daughters did not have to sleep together. We ordered a cot for our 4 year old which by the way is more comfortable than the pull out sofa! The Westin made this right, however, even Rebecca stated that she wished the booking agents at Westin would be more honest about the rooms and I agree whole heartedly. Had she not been able to fix this problem we would have been livid. As a matter of fact while I was down working this out I had my wife on the phone with the Hyatt next door where we have stayed in previous trips. They were ready to accommodate us. Even though Westin got this right in the end, I am extremely disappointed that it had to go that far to start with. I felt totally deceived! The pools are great and were a little chilly like everyone on here states but I find that refreshing. We are very disappointed about the fact that this property only has one Jacuzzi and that you have to be 16 or older to go in it, come on. Twice our kids were asked to leave the Jacuzzi. Look, kids love Jacuzzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at least ours do and with all the rain and the chilly pool they wanted to warm up. It is ridiculous that they only have one Jacuzzi and they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let kids in it. This made my wife livid. We never had problems getting towels or seats by the pool but it was raining most of the time we were there so I am sure this may have been different had everyone been out by the pool. Only committed swimmers were out most days willing to swim in the rain or stormy conditions. The elevators in the beach tower of this property had foul odors. Not sure what is up with that but we were overwhelmed by the foul odors in at least two of the elevators and this disgusted us each time we went to and from our rooms. Thank goodness we were only on the 2nd floor. We found the staff very friendly and accommodating. The food on the property was nothing special. There is no indoor restaurant so all the rain made it not fun to eat on property which we really only did for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is expensive $25/adult, kids eat free but it was very good. Some people complain about the $18 daily resort fee but in my opinion it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it. For this you get free internet, free parking, a couple bottles of water each day and some other stuff that made it worth it for me. All in all the property is showing some wear and tear and needs some updating. The location is fabulous and the property is very keiki (kid) friendly with the exception of the Jacuzzi. The health spa is very nice with some great machines for working out. My wife and I both had massages and they were both good. The spa has great facilities. We absolutely wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here again based on the deception about the rooms and needed repairs to the property. Probably we will not consider another Westin property for quite a while because of the deception.

If you are travling with a baby, I suggest reserving Denise in advance so you can have some time for yourselves. Between our two trips to Maui, we've tried many of the Island's top rated restuarants.

It was my first trip to Maui and my wife's 2nd trip. The hotel was fantastic. Location: The location could not be better - right in the middle of everything. The beach was great with Whaler's Village right next store. The drive to Kapalua is only 10 minutes and Front Street in Lahaina is only 5 minutes away. Dining: I would recommend eating lunch at Whaler's Village versus at the hotel to help your budget. The food at the hotel was pretty good, but expensive - not a surprise. We ate at Kimo's in Lahaina & Hula Grill at Whaler's Village - good food, good prices, great service & location for both restaurants. The Food Court at Whaler's Village offers McDonald's, Chinese, Mexican, Subs, and Smoothies - prices are reasonable and well worth the walk next door for lunch. Rooms: The rooms were small, but well appointed and clean. Housekeeping does a nice job at this hotel keeping the rooms clean. The bellmen and concierge staff are very friendly and knowledgeable - use them if you aren't familiar with the area. Pools: Great pools. The lounge chairs are padded and the best on Kaanapali Beach. The adult pool area was a nice break. The Westin's pool rivaled those at the Marriott & Hyatt. Timeshare: We met with a concierge one morning and got roped into going to a timeshare presentation. They offered us $100 to be used in the hotel, so we decided to check it out. The person who gave us the presentation spoke so fast we could hardly understand her. They said it wasn't a high-pressure sale, but it was. You'd think they would understand you need time to think before spending $50,000 - $80,000 on a timeshare. While we put the $100 towards the spa (which is great by the way), it wasn't worth dealing with the stuck-up, high-pressure sales presentation...don't waste your time unless it's raining or you are really interested. Luau: We went to the Royal Lahaina Luau. It was a lot of fun, but somewhat cramped for space. The location was great - 2 minutes from the hotel. The food was good and the show very entertaining. Dinner Cruise: We went on the Terlani Dinner Cruise which picked us up right next door at Whaler's Village. The staff was excellent, the food good, and the bar stocked. We had whales swimming around the boat the entire trip. I highly recommend this trip and this specific Terlani Boat Tour. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would go back. The Westin was a great place to stay and we have great memories of our honeymoon there.

Rants: \"Deluxe Oceanview\" what a crock! I wish I had discovered this site BEFORE reserving this category. What a sorry joke. For $485 a night, we were offered a room overlooking the parking lot of Whaler's Village. The noise was horrible! Delivery trucks, cars coming and going, (beep beep beep) and the poisonous, foul smell of diesel. You could not see the ocean from any place in the room...only from the balcony. I know they need to sell these rooms, but they should be fairly priced and more honest in the description. This room was on the 7th floor. Joven said it was a \"very nice, deluxe room.\" After a very long, highly unpleasant process, we were able to move to a much better room on the 6th floor of the main building. This was an \"Oceanview\" category. The view was great, including soothing sounds of the fountains, and views of the pools, flamingos, koi, waterslide, people, and parrots. The housekeeping staff kept the room spotless. The only other complaint regarding the room would be the stench of cigarette smoke. Smoking is banned in all guestrooms, but allowed on the balconies. This new policy is a brilliant one for Westin --- saving Westin money on cleaning smoke-infested rooms. Those of us who prefer fresh air (we spend most of our time when not sleeping out on our balcony when in the islands)are denied such because all of the smokers (in our case we had smokers on one side and below us!) are out on their balconies, puffing away. The smell of smoke managed to not only infect our balcony, but also blew into our room. The non-smoking policy is a huge blessing, though, in the lobby and around the pools. They do have designated spots for those who need their smoke, including one of the pools. One more rant, ~ the service in Tropica. It's a really great place ~ the location is awesome and the food is really good. But they are seriously understaffed. We popped in for lunch while waiting for our room on the first day (the 3 p.m. check-in is the rule --- which surprised us, as we have now stayed at almost every hotel on Maui and have never had that problem.) There was a very sweet lady who seated us. Then she disappeared. What reappeared was a mad cow who should never work with the public. When the gods were handing out aloha spirit, she must have gotten in the wrong line. Unbelievable! She hardly acknowledged that we existed, looking mostly annoyed that we were taking space in the restaurant. WHAT? Are we in FRANCE? We heard her involved in not just one, but two arguments with other guests. Scary lady. After 50 minutes, our entrees arrived. One problem: No napkins or silverware. And no waitress in sight. I finally found the wait station and got our own, as Ms. UnFriendly was no where to be found. Our entrees were delicious, though, worth the wait. By the way, though we're mainlanders, we pretty much live our lives on \"island time.\" So, it's not that we expect super prompt service. We just expect service. Two days later, we chose to dine at Tropica again. They were still understaffed, but what a difference an attitude can make. A nice gentlemen greeted us, apologized that they were understaffed, but welcomed us to relax and enjoy the view and that he promised he would get to us within the next ten minutes. No worries! Thoroughly pleasant experience. The raves: The pool area is beautiful. Although the resort was at full occupancy, it never felt crowded, due to the great design. The various pools are spread out nicely. The landscaping is abundant and well tended. The waterslide is a blast! Cushions on the lounge chairs -- this is becoming rare at resorts, but gratefully, the Westin Maui is maintaining a very good tradition. The lobby area is wonderful. The infused waters and lemon towelettes are a nice touch. There is a nice \"flow\" and again, it never felt crowded. All in all, it was a wonderful vacation. We visit Maui twice a year, splitting time between Wailea and Kaanapali. We would recommend the Westin, but encourage you to be particular about the location of your room.

When we told her we got married the night before she upgraded out room to a deluxe ocean view. It was truly spectacular. We looked out upon nothing but the beach and the two islands in the distance. Beneath us was Tropico (best lobster tail we had in Maui and you have to try the carmelized onion and goat cheese flat bread...we liked it so much we made our own version back in the mainland!)that has live music every night. While we were there it was just one guy and his ukulale...very soothing and romantic! My husband and I actually went to Safeway (Same comapny as Dominicks to us Chicagoans...and I even used my preferred card!) and picked up alcohol and sat on our balcony one night drinking and listening to music and the ocean! It sure beats the 9 dollars a drink at the bar! We also were suprised with champagne from the management in room on our second night there!

First off our Heavenly bed was anything but heavenly. The side of the bed closest to the window was totally broken down and seemed like the mattress had never been turned, I was rolling off all the bed all night and felt like I had to brace myself. The mattress was also very lumpy and my husband became very irritated about this. We spoke to the front desk but nothing was done. (2.) The Heavenly showerhead was mounted too low. If you were any taller than 5'-5\" the showerhead was not above your head and hit you in the chin if lucky, this made washing one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face and hair very difficult. We were told that the rooms had been renovated recently but the mounting heights had not been changed. This was a big mistake in my opinion. (3.) Our toilet leaked and ran all night which made our sleeping on a lumpy broken down mattress that much more enjoyable. (4.)Our small patio looked on the roof of the timeshare offices and it was anything but pretty. (5.) There was scheduled maintenance occurring on our patio that we were not notified about. We would open our drape one morning and see workers painting and then come back to our room later and see that all the plants had been ripped out of their planters. (6.) We were hounded and hounded to look at some timeshare villas next door to the Westin. We finally gave in and were told the process would only take an hour and a half well three and half hours later we were sick of all the lies and pressure. The gift also totally sucked and they changed their story on what the gift really was. We were treated like garbage once Westin knew we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to purchase a timeshare.

When we first arrived at the Westin we were greeted with fresh leis which was wonderful. The lobby and the hotel grounds are spectacular.

Jovan at the desk rudely advised us that only gold and platinum members could be helped at this counter, after having him recheck our SPG status he found that we were gold member and he agreed to check us in to our room. However he did not apologize for the misunderstanding and was very cold. Our honeymoon package was not available and we were told to pick it up later. Jovan did upgrade us to the beach tower, however our ocean view room also overlooked the parking lot. (Not what I had in mind for my honeymoon.). After talking with 4 different people we finally received our honeymoon package, minus the strawberries and champagne (it took us four tries to get those delivered). The housekeeping staff on the 11th floor left much to be desired, they provided the bare minimum services of clean towels and making the bed. Also I had read in other reviews that there was not enough closet space, I did not find this to be the case. On the positive side the next day things improved greatly. We stopped by the counter (not the gold and platinum counter) and talked with Brandy. Brandy was so helpful she moved us to an ocean front room for an extra $50.00 per day. We could not ask for a more spectacular view. The housekeeping on the 6th floor was great, they kept our room straightened and provided fresh robes daily. We watched the whales from our lanai every morning. Breakfast in the Ono caf\u00c3\u00a9 was excellent, I would highly recommend eating there, however the cost is $24 per person, but kids eat free. We had dinner at Tropica and it was okay, but not somewhere I would recommend. The pools at the Westin are beautiful, really cold in the morning but by afternoon they are okay.

It seems that many people using this site get so raved up about minor incidents and decree the entire hotel a waste of money. Yes, it's expensive, as is everything on Maui! So, on with my review. Our stay was perfect from the get-go. It was my birthday, and they upgraded us from the \"mountain view\" room that we'd paid for to a \"deluxe ocean view\" room, with a spectacular view (only partially obscured by part of the hotel's facade) of the ocean and the beautiful Westin grounds. Our room was in the newer tower which features slightly larger rooms than those in the original tower. We had the Heavenly King bed as well as a couch, not to mention the large balcony with that gorgeous view. The room was everything one would expect from the high-end Westin name. The hotel grounds were amazing. Gorgeous waterfalls, pools, strolling paths, etc. The lobby isn't even enclosed, but opens up to a lake with swans and waterfalls. Just beautiful! The pools are awesome! We never had any trouble getting chairs, though some people would try to save chairs at 8am, go eat, then return. The hotel doesn't allow this, which is a good thing. After eating breakfast and enjoying a morning stroll, we found nice chairs at the adult pool, near the bar and the waterslide. What an afternoon! The Westin's location is superb. While one can find better snorkeling just up the beach in front of the Sheraton, the beach in front of the Westin is smooth and calm, and perfect for sunbathing and swimming (the beach in front of the Sheraton is a bit steeper, with rougher waves). We walked up to the Sheraton to check out the snorkeling, and also enjoyed drinks at Whaler's Village. For groceries, one can drive just a few miles south of the Westin to a large shopping center with a drug store, supermarket, and plenty of other diversions. The Westin Maui is wonderful. Expensive, but worth it in my opinion.

For the first 5 days, we stayed at the Westin in Kaanapali and the Fairmont in Wailea for the rest. This was our 4th trip to Maui. Here are some overall comments that people might find useful. The Westin is a great hotel both given its location and the property itself. It is great to be a 2 min walk to the Whalers village with some great dining options, an ABC store and the Maui Dive shop to rent snorkeling and diving equipment. In addition, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd off the beach near the Sheraton is about a 5-10 minute walk. The Westin is in the Kaanapali area which is a very popular area. As such, the area is crowded but is close to a lot of amenities. Lahaina and Kapalua are about a 10 min drive from the Westin. The Westin is gorgeous with its great lobby, waterfalls, three pools and on one of the best beaches. We had a mountain view room in the Ocean tower. The room was small but comfortable. It was very clean and had the Westin bed and shower. There is a small fridge in the room which we used to store bottled water, sodas and some lunch meat. In order to get a chair by the pool, we needed to be there by 8 am to reserve a chair. The pool service people were good at removing chairs that had been reserved but unoccupied for about an hour (sign says 30 min but an hour is probably better customer service). When we could not get a chair by the pool, we were able to get chairs by the beach for an extra $10 per chair. Do not understand how a lot of people can be so inconsiderate with reserving chairs. We had a family of 6 that reserved 6 chairs at 8 am, went on a snorkeling expedition, did not return till 2 pm and threw a scene about their towels not being there. The Westin charges a $18 a day resort fee. This fee covers your parking (self parking only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c valet is an extra $10), free local calls, free internet access from your room and 2 bottles of water per day. Usually parking in big resorts costs this amount so we were fine with the charge. Only two issues with the Westin was the Ono restaurant and the water temperature in the pools . The food at Ono is bad and the lunch offerings were very unexciting. Christmas dinner was awful. However being so close to the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s village is an advantage. The Whalers village has a food court that has Chinese, Mexican, subs, salads, smoothies and McDonalds which is great for lunch. The pool water was very cold again. Just do not know why they cannot fix this problem. This is our fourth trip back to Maui and is definitely one of our favorite hotels for the value of the money, location and pool area.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful hotel, but you'll have plenty of company\u201d", "Author": "MWales", "ReviewID": "UR4316800", "Content": "We had our honeymoon at the Westin in December 2003, after spending our first week on Oahu. The hotel is excellent; the pool is extensive and great fun with the slides; and the beach is spectacular, especially if you like a bit of rough and tumble in the surf (though be wary of the currents that can drag you up the beach). The staff were very friendly and were keen to assist you from the moment you arrived. The rooms were light and very clean; the beds, as soft as you can get (I've never seen pillows so big!) The food was also of a high standard, but hard to compete with the restaurants in the Whaler's Village a few yards along the beach path. On the down side, so it goes, the Westin can get very busy at this time of year - as we found out. It's not that there isn't plenty of room in the grounds or on the beach to go around, far from it. It's just that some people might find it a little bit too busy. It was unfortunate for us that after three days of sunshine we then had the worse weather Maui's had for five years, so the locals informed us. The streets filled up with water and so did the hotel; to the extent that the lifts in the hotel actually started leaking water like in some disaster movie! The path along the beach at one point was knee-deep from the torrential rain; the sea turned a horrid and violent red and we were forced to cancel our whale-watching trip and our flight over the Big Island. We hired a Ford Mustang to get around and as we drove it home from a restaurant in Lahaina one night, without exagerration, the water on the roads was nearly level with the underside of the car. Other than nature's setbacks, we'd recommend a stay at the Westin to anybody, and Kaanapali Beach as a perfect setting. We'd almost certainly stay at the Westin again. M.

We were using Starwoods points and paid extra to have two of the best possible rooms in the Beach Tower to accommodate our family of six (mom, dad, 4 kids ages 14, 13, 10 and 9) in connecting rooms (1 King, 2 doubles). It was a good choice for our family although more crowded than we expected due to the annual basketball tournament. We expected it to be crowded because it was Thanksgiving week, but didn't appreciate the fan clubs and college bands playing at pep rallies on the premises while we were hanging at the pool and beach that week. Obviously, not every week is like this and it did not ruin our trip, but be warned if you are planning a Thanksgiving week visit in the future. The pools were terrific and we also loved the beach. Our kids loved the big, twisty slide and had a lot of fun in the connecting pools. Although we didn't use it, there was an \"adults-only\" pool which is a very nice feature if you are not there with kids. The two restuarants on-site were good and met our expectations. There were an abundance of activities and excursions available to book. We chose to take a great snorkeling trip on a catamaran one day that departed from the beach out front and we absolutely loved it. Another day we went into Lahaina and took surfing lessons at \"Goofy Foot\" Surfing School. Fantastic fun for kids and adults. Our connecting rooms were on the sixth floor and while they were not spacious they were perfectly fine since we had terrific weather and didn't spend a whole lot of time in the rooms. We had lots of closet space and good housekeeping service every day. The location of the Westin is good. We were looking for 5 days of R&R on a beautiful island where our kids could be kids and we could relax at the pool and beach. By walking on the path along the beach we had the chance to walk past and through some of the other hotels/condos in the Kaanapali area. It confirmed for us that the Westin was the preferred resort in Kaanapali for what we were looking for, with the Hyatt coming in second (we stayed at the Hyatt for our honeymoon). The Westin has the best pool, nice landscaping, plenty of activities to book and the \"Whaler's Village\" next door. It is a more crowded scene than we would choose if it was just my husband and me traveling but it was great for a family destination. I used the gym and found it to be spacious and well-equipped. I had one treatment in the spa which was beautifully appointed.

Upon arrival we were greeted with very helpful porters and the usual Maui welcome etc. We checked into our deluxe ocean front room (which I would recommend as the sun is on your balcony all day) and the fun started from there. The concierge are very helpful but be warned, they do try and encourage you to attend the 'timeshare' seminar but if you are strong minded then you simply say no thank you. Our room was fantastic. The beds are 'heavenly' and the showers are the same. We had wonderful views of the pool and the ocean. The ocean was literally 30 yards from our balcony. In and around the resort is very cool and relaxing. We preferred the pool bar at the top of the rocks as the views at sunset are something in itself. The other bar near the ono grill was also good,especially at night when a bartender called 'Frank' is on duty, he makes you laugh. Eating is very good in and around the hotel. On our 1st night ate in the Ono Grill, yes this was expensive but what do you epxect for a 5 star hotel??????? you are not going to get burger and fries for $2.99, its far from mcdonalds. Our 2nd night we booked a table at 'hulas', this was a superb meal and pretty good value for money. This restaurant and others is literally 100 yards from the hotel, a short walk on the beach front and you arrive at Whalers Village. Whalers Village is cool. We found ourselves in a good routine in having mid-afternoon cocktails in the 'rusty Harpoon' then back to the hotel for more drinks. Away from the alcohol, the resort is simply superb stacked with shops from louis Vuitton to the abc convience store There is so much to do in and around the resort. The reason I have gone into this so much as I dont want anyone else to worry about the resort like I did. I booked this holiday in January and have been checking some of the comments ever since. Looking back at these comments now, because I know the resort, some of the comments were totally untrue and unfounded. I think sometimes people will find anything to have a moan about. We walked upto the Sheraton and the pool is small only 1 pool bar didnt seem as nice as the Westin, neither did the Marriott!!! * yes you do have to pay $18 per day for resort fees ie. Towels,water and Internet access in your room..... so drink the bottles of water on your room and take your laptop!!!! * yes, drinks and food are expensive but search around the resort and there are plenty of 'happy hour' deals ie Rusty Harpoon. * The pool area does get a little busy but the beach is literally yards from the hotel....... plenty of room on there folks. * Its a family resort, so you can epxect children.... where else in the world is not these days????? * A wonderful hotel!!!

For our family, Sheraton was the preferred location overall. Your opinion may be different. Read on. Westin Maui: 1. Extremely hectic feeling (the landscape is awesome with waterfalls but add a ton of people noise during the day and it loses ambience quickly) 2. Has more staff on hand to assist you 3. Keiki (Children's) Camp is awesome (especially Nicole, their counselor) 4. Ono Grill serves decent food at high price 5. Terrace serves pretty good food and great view 6. Very helpful and friendly staff 7. Very nicely equipped workout room (didn't use a minute of it!) 8. Good pools Sheraton Maui: 1. Awesome snorkeling right at your footstep 2. Relaxed and more serene atmosphere (reminds us of Jamaica) 3. Ample parking 4. Fabulous view (if you get ocean front) 5. Fairly helpful staff but minimally staffed compared to Westin 6. Restaurant food match up to prices quite well (except for the breakfast buffet) 7. Kid's pool - wading area and 3 ft area Not very impressed by both locations' rooms and bathrooms but no complains since we spent minimal time in the rooms even though we had ocean front/view rooms. If you have little kids, both places are fun but Sheraton has the kid's pool. Older kids will prefer the Westin slides at their pools. If you want to try out snorkeling and scuba, definitely pick Sheraton because it's right at your doorstep. We decided on the Starwood properties over other properties like Hyatt and Ritz (all about the same price as we received great package offers.) We checked out both locations and was very happy with our decisions. Hyatt probably has better pools but was even more crowded! The thing that pushed us to Sheraton over Hyatt was the beach. Review on Hyatt's lack of beach was the major reason we avoided Hyatt and the review was correct. To get my little ones to the beach was not as easy at the Ritz as it was surrounded by the golf course. If you decide on Maui, do get the \"Maui Revealed\" book if you intend to venture outside of your resort. You'll find great tidepools, beaches, activities and food recommendations. As for food, if you decide to eat at Whaler's Village, we love Leilani's (lunch and dinner). Hula Grill was quite good too. Rusty Harpoon service and food is mediocre at best (lunch and dinner). Sansei close to Ritz at Kapalua is as good as advertised. Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina is decent but Da Kitchen in Kihei serves awesome local food. For Califonians, you will most likely find David Paul a tad bit overrated. Wished we had time to try Pacific'O. We found no reason to try Moose McGillycuddys or Roys as they're readily available in California. Hope this helps. Definitely get \"Maui Revealed\" book. Enjoy your trip.

There's nothing really wrong with the hotel, but it's not as outstanding as some others that we've stayed at for the same price or less. The hotel is very nice and clean. The grounds are very lush and tropical. When we arrived, we were immediately upgraded to a partial ocean view room which was nice. A lot of the previous reviews said that the rooms were really small, but our room was a reasonably sized room. The previous reviews said the lanai was small, but it was certainly big enough for two people to sit on and relax comfortably. The room had a refrigerator which was nice. We were able to get some snacks and drinks and keep them in the refrigerator instead of constantly paying the high price for the drinks at the hotel. The daily resort fee was a bit much for free internet access, parking, a newspaper, health club access, and free water everyday, but there's no way out of it. They said that we only got 2 free waters a day, but we easily ended up getting 4 free waters a day. Still not worth $18/ day. The restaurants at the hotel left a lot to be desired. They were expensive and just so so. We had a breakfast buffett everyday which was nice, but for $23.75/ person it would have been nice if it had more variation throughout the days of the week instead of the same thing everyday. The food at the pool was expensive. A gardenburger was $14. We ended up ordering off of the kids menu and the servings were adult size, but at kid prices. We were somewhat surprised that they let us, but they didn't bat an eye. The hotel was located right next to the Whaler's Village which is a shopping center with nice shops and some restaurants. The restaurants were about the same price as the hotel restaurants (or maybe a little cheaper,) but had more variety and slightly better food. In the evenings, they were always crowded with a good 45minute to 1hr + wait. The pools were great. There were 5 of them. We never went to the adults only pool, but it looked the same as the rest. There were not that many kids there (I'm guessing because of the time of year.) So, we were able to enjoy all pools without kids bugging us. It was a little wierd that they didn't have a kiddie pool anywhere, but whatever. There were some nice slides and grottos and waterfalls all around that were fun to swim around. You could rent cabana's for $50/ day or $25/ for a half day or chaise lounges and umbrella's on the beach for $25/ day. Either way, you were kicked out at 4:30pm whether you were finished or not. I kept reading about the great service at the pool and wondered if I went to the same hotel. Two out of the 5 days that we went to the pool, there was one waitress for all 5 pools. She was fantastic and did a great job all things considered, but when she has to take care of 5 pools..... It took a while to get food or drink. The prices of drinks was outrageous! We paid $10 for a regular frozen drink and $6.50 for a virgin frozen drink! We finally went to the Safeway down the street and bought the ingredients to make our own and took them to the pool. We weren't really harassed that much with sales pitches about the time share which somewhat surprised us. Before we arrived, we received several phone calls at our house in CA to make sure we stopped by the concierge as soon as we got there to pick up a gift. We also had a couple of phone calls the day we arrived, but we never stopped by the desk because we were too afraid of getting roped into a sales pitch. We found out the gift was a paper bag with a picture of the resort on it. We didn't feel like we missed out on much. All in all, there's nothing really wrong with the hotel. There are just better hotels closer by for about the same amount of money.", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe Westin Maui was Excellent\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4073366", "Content": "We had a great time at the Westin Maui. After arriving at the airport it is worth hiring a car in Maui at the airport for your stay, saves a fortune on transfer, and the hiring of the car worked out cheaper for my family of five. We hired a Buick people mover with a dvd player, which kept the kids quiet, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to take dvds along. On the drive from the airport you drive past Kmart which is 5 minutes on your left as you drive to the Westin. At Kmart you can purchase any additional items that you forgot or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to carry like chillers, masks, snorkels, bogie boards, beach chairs, umbrellas etc that you forgot to pack. About a few more minutes up on the left are 10 factory outlets like the Sports Authority, liquor, Old Navy shops etc for those extras. After I suppose a 30-40 minute drive along the coast, which was beautiful we arrived at the Westin Maui, we were greeted with leis on arrival. The entry and front desk area is magnificent, with the waterfalls, pond, fish and birds. Our 2 rooms were mountain view and normal size and fine, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on holidays to vacation in my room. Dresser and wardrobe space was adequate for the tropics, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going on a world cruise and require a walk in wardrobe as some other reviewers have stated??? The room was quite well presented with the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and presentation. It was cleaned daily on time, and the staff were prompt and courteous for any matters referred to for extra pillows or linen. I think it has paid off for the Westin to stop the sharing scheme for pools between Sheraton Maui and the Westin Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The only ones complaining are the Sheraton guests, but now at the Westin you can always get a lounge at any time by the pool. The pools were fantastic for the kids and the kids at heart. I saw lots of honeymooners, and they seemed to be down by the normal pools and not by the adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only pool, but the honeymooners always have that option. The waterslide was great fun too. The timeshare people never annoyed us, I did a morning presentation at 9.30 and the family got fed too, muffins, juice pastries. $100 voucher for food and a 50% off next stay voucher too. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast, by the time we got up by 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ish it was almost time for lunch. We generally got fresh fruit salad from next door at the Whalers shopping shops if we felt hungry or the ABC store for sandwiches. We did have dinner a few times in the tapas bar by the poolside, which was good. Cocktails and food by the pool were the normal prices and the quality you would expect. I have no complaints about food or their service at the Westin. We had dinner at the Rusty Harpoon, which cost us $150 for 2 adults and 3 children with the kids having children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meals, the food was fine. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call it great value but hey I was on holidays. Down at Lahaina town we went to Buba Gumps, which initially I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure about, but it only cost us $75 and the meal passed my expectations, so I would recommend it to anyone. We did some driving on Maui, but limited our driving to the west side of Maui which was quite picturesque. We went snorkeling o Black Rock, which is 5 minutes north up the beach next to the Sheraton Maui. I think this is the easiest and best sport in Maui for a quick snorkel. We saw sea turtles, sting rays and numerous tropical fish. Just a few tips, I would take some bread like a bread roll to feed the fish when snorkeling. Also, if you want to hire the snorkeling stuff just hire it from the Maui Dive shop in Whalers Village as they seem the best value, for example mask, fins, snorkel, mesh bag and they put some no-fog gell in the mask for $7.95 for the day per person, there are other packages but well worth it. Make sure you buy one of those dispossible underwater cameras too. Plus if you have smaller children hire a boggie baord too for $5 a day. Go to mauidiveshop website and then go to rentals tab. Whalers Village was right next door and had all the normal up market stores to kept the females busy too. The ABC shop was very handy, we bought a lot of snacks etc plus it was the cheapest place for ice creams. It might also be worth getting the Hawaii edition of the entertainment book, but Maui was very limited for coupons, unless you were also going to Oahu. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another review I still have to write. Overall, the Westin Maui was great and we look forward to coming back very soon with my all the family again. I would recommend it for anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 family, couples, honeymooners, old, but for singles not really the right place to meet other singles. For the other negative reviews that have been placed, I just cannot understand what they are going on about and could not fault anything here.

It is also right next to a terrific section of beach so if you like to swim in the ocean, you will love it here. By far the biggest disappointment was the room. They are rather on the small side but as long as you haven't packed alot of clothes you can make it work. But the thing that bothered me the most was the noise factor. I am a light sleeper and you could hear the conversation of the people in the room next to you! If they went out on the balcony it was even worse. Luckily, we had quiet neighbors the first few nights, but the last two nights we were awoken several times by out neighbors....they weren't even being that loud it's just that the walls are that thin. So if you are a light sleeper I would suggest bringing a small fan or some other noise blocking device with you. The staff was just so-so, except for the poolside servers who were terrific. I don't think we would ever stay here again unless we got a really really good deal...too expensive compared to other properties we have stayed at while on Maui, like the Sheraton, Hyatt, Four Seasons, and the Wailea Renaissance.

After reading several mixed reviews on Trip Advisor we were interested to see what our experience would be. We found everyone on the staff to be very helpful (I've NEVER seen so many concierges at one hotel before) and they \"offered\" the time share sales pitch option only once and in the most \"un-pushy\" and low key way I have ever experienced. The few times we had to call down about something, the response was almost immediate. The resort is absolutely beautiful and excellently maintained. The lobby and outside area was so appealing with the huge number of waterfalls, lush foliage, and colorful water birds. We found (in late September) that it was not overcrowded at the pool area at any time, and the pool lounges were far nicer and more comfortable than the vinyl ones at many other hotels. Our room was quite small but nicely equipped, we had a marvelous mountain view from our balcony and we saw rainbows many afternoons. The \"heavenly bed\" is quite comfortable, the sheets are really soft, and the pillow menu has something for everyone. The Westin is nicely located such a short walk from the Whaler's Village which has scads of restaurants (of all price points) and shops. The only slightly negative things we would say are: *housekeeping often didn't get our room made up until late in the afternoon; *we don't feel that we got our money's worth out of the $18 per day \"extras\" charge since the only part of it we really used was the 2 bottles of water each day ( housekeeping forgot to put the water in our room 2 of the days we were there, but it was brought to us right away when we called down); *they really don't have near enough non-valet parking (but when we arrived late on our first night there we were told that when the lot is full they'll valet park for resort guests at no charge). These tiny negatives were nothing in comparison to the beauty of the Westin, its wonderful location, and accomodating staff. We would stay there again \"in a New York minute\" and will recommend it to our friends. While on Maui be sure to drive the road to Hana; eat at \"Cheeseburgers in Paradise\" and shop in Lahaina; go up to Haleakala and marvel at the landscape (go for sunrise, or sunset, or just in the middle of the day...it's so worth the ride!).

My children rented a movie which cost $15.99 each, and to check their e-mail they were charged $10.41 (4x) to check it 1 time. We decided to go to the pool and on one occassion I was verbally abused by one guest at 6:30 in the morning for removing a pair of shoes from a chair under a cabanna! This same thing happened the first time we stayed at the Westin! So, here I am already planning my vacation for next year, and thinking to myself what I don't want in a vacation when the Westin came to mind.", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "giulietta429", "ReviewID": "UR3926287", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin from September 7 to September 12.

On check-in, we were upgraded (without asking) from a terrace room (non-view, parking lot) to a full ocean view at no extra charge. We went to the Westin on a package $749 for 5 nights, with rental car included (midsize) and a $100 resort certificate. Having read all the negative reviews, we were worried, but it was simply perfect. Our room (#656) was spacious, very clean, beautifully decorated, and had a wonderful view. Housekeeping was timely every day. The parking lot was always full so we got free valet parking. We used the resort certificate to pay the $18/day resort fee. We also got a welcome gift (calendar) and a Westin shopping bag. As part of the resort fee, we could have gotten a free portrait sitting and a 4x6 photo, but we did not arrange for it. The pools, the landscaping, the waterfalls - were picture perfect. The hot tub was relaxing as well. They could have enforced the no-babies in the hot tub policy a bit better. the adult pool was warmer than the other pools. The waterslide was an absolute blast. The waterslide attendant taught us how to go really fast and we just could not get enough of it. We felt like kids again (I am 26, my boyfriend is 33). We walked up and down Ka'anapali beach comparing the Westin to other resorts and decided that it was the best. It's fabulous pools and central location (right next to Whaler's Village, close to the Black Rock) made it a wonderful place to be. I did not find concierges to be pushy in terms of time shares. We did not attend a timeshare presentation (although the idea behind the deal that we got was to encourage us to attend one; it was not required so we did not go).

We had a great time. There were several aspects of the Westin, however, that left a bit to be desired. First, this Westin is not up to the standard of other Westins where we have stayed. It is not a \"luxury\" hotel. As other reviews have noted, the rooms are small and not the most clean. There is limited drawer and closet space. The furniture looked a bit beat-up. The Heavenly Beds are cozy, but if you want clean sheets daily or turn-down service, you'll have to request it. The first room we stayed in had a vague smell of mold. The workout room is cramped and not air conditioned enough. The hallways are also stuffy from an apparent lack of air conditioning. The pool area is very attractive and well-maintained. Overall, however, the facility is aging and not really what I'd consider a luxury property. Second, customer service is not great. We faced a long line for check-in. The reason why was apparent when we reached our agonizingly slow clerk. What should have been a quick transaction took about 10 minutes. When we got to our room, we had a question about it, which we tried to resolve by calling the front desk. No one would answer the phone. So, we went back downstairs and waited in line again to speak with a clerk. When I told him we tried calling but couldn't get through, he said, \"Yeah, we're really busy.\" Not the right answer! How about an apology? The pool staff were generally equally clueless and disdainful of customers. There were several times when I went to the front desk or the pool desk, was the only person waiting there for help, and would have to wait for the several employees working to stop their own conversations amongst themselves before I would be acknowledged. Not good. Third, and this would not be a drawback for everyone, there were a lot of kids. We did not expect to see so many children on vacation after Labor Day! That said, the Westin Maui has several strengths. The first is its location. It is right on beautiful Kaanapali Beach. It's walking distance to Whalers Village and a couple minutes' drive to Lahaina. There is a lot to do very close to the hotel. If you enjoy snorkeling, you can walk to Black Rock, at the end of the beach on front of the Sheraton, and see tons of fish right off the beach. We'd agree with other positive reviews of Hula Grill. The food is very good and much more reasonably priced than the Westin food. Hula Grill has a wonderful view of the ocean, and you can sit at a table with your toes in the sand, sip a fruity drink, and watch the sun set while you enjoy the nightly live Hawaiian music. The staff there was great, and they also have a good happy hour. Lahaina is a fun place to walk around, shop, and eat and drink. We ate at I'o and David Paul's Lahaina Grill and both were excellent. The pool and beach areas are great. The pool area is meticulously landscaped and includes an adults-only pool. The one drawback to the pool area is it has limited shade. The spots under the umbrellas were usually claimed early and remained taken all day. So, unless you wanted to bake in the sun all day, you had to stake your claim to a shady spot early! But the pool and beach overall are very, very nice. One final note -- while I find hotel food in general to be overpriced and mediocre, we enjoyed the lunches served poolside. There are several tasty healthy options such as salads and lighter wrap sandwiches. While the drinks are overpriced, the food prices were reasonable, especially given that eating at the pool is more convenient than getting up and going elsewhere. Overall, Maui was a great place to visit, and the Westin was nice, but it may not be what you're looking for if you're considering splurging on a \"luxury\" vacation.", "Date": "September 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Location, and Spa!\u201d", "Author": "BDE", "ReviewID": "UR3913109", "Content": "If you are a Starwood Platinum member you will really enjoy this hotel.

I was a little concerned with some of the reviews I had read prior to our trip but after staying there myself I have to wonder what these people were thinking about. I almost find it hard to believe that they were at the same resort. The Westin was everything I expected and more. It was expensive but what in Hawaii isn't. The pool is the best in Kaanapali, and the beach behind the resort is beautiful. There is plenty of room on this beach compared to the Hyatt (grass, a steep drop off, and approxiamately a 10ft wide swath of sand). Your right next door to Whalers Village which offers some of the best shopping on the island and 5 minutes from old town Lahaina. The hotel service was prompt and extremely friendly and the concierge was right on the money when recommending David Paul's (first class restuarant in downtown Lahaina). The American Express travel desk has the ability to book just about any type of event or experience that you may be interested in. You could stand in the lobby for hours and marvel at the sight of waterfalls, flamingo's, parrots, and huge coi fish swimming beneath your feet. My wife and I are going back next year for our 1 year anniversary and we will not even entertain the idea of checking out a few other hotels before booking at the Westin again.

Let me tell you this hotel is not in the luxury category, not even moderate-luxury. The location is perfect, resort is beautiful. But the service is very inconsistent. And the pool area is a zoo. Pool towel desk didn't open until 8am. You just can't get any towels if you're at the pool earlier. We were there in Sept, so technically not peak season. Still lots of kids screaming, running around. But I expected that & dealed with it. However, the pool attendants were just not up to par with their services. We were yelled at by other guests. The pool attendant, instead of trying to ease the guests angers, decided to fuel it. She just stood there, and let the whole fiasco go on. I eventually talked to 2 managers, who agreed with me. By that time I was embarrassed, and angry. The bottom line is, these staff are just not trained to handle difficult situations or solve any problems. They just DON'T CARE. We went to Four Seasons afterwards, and it's night and day difference. Room is small and dated. Lots of stains on the carpet. Was promised turndown service, but none until I requested it. Safe broke after 2 days. Plastic pieces in our bed sheets. Westin Maui is not cheap. But yet they still nickel and dime you. Valet parking is $12 a day. Resort fee $19 daily. Very limited pool service. No lounge bars or anything. Food was OK, but nothing to write home about. We have 4 adults, with 2 rooms, but they just couldn't figure out who is staying at which one. We have to explain ourselves each time we charged to our room. Just clueless management. The spa was good, but not great. The whirlpool is small. The service is not that personal. Again, I like 4 season's massage a lot more. Maui is beautiful, and Westin has great location. I honestly hope this hotel will pull itself together. Otherwise, people will read from this forum and realize it's not a great resort like they advertise it.

It was a big change after being on the Big Island which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as many cars, roads or people, but it was great. We splurged on an Ocean View room and it was worth the money. Sitting out on the lanai as the sun sank to the horizon was indescribable. The room itself is very nice with the wonderful Westin beds. We had a two double bed room with a rollaway. The rollaway cots don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fold so the mattresses are much better than those normally found in hotels and provide a very comfortable night sleep. The room also had the sink outside the bathroom across from a counter area with a coffee pot, refrigerator and safe. All tucked neatly away, but allowing room for all the snacks and things that usually make a room very messy. There weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite enough drawers (only two very large and deep ones) and a small hanging area, but we made do. The lanai was big enough for two chairs and a small table and we took the room chair out sometimes. The bathroom was tight near the toilet (you had to close the door before you sat, but the shower was spacious, particularly since it had the rod that extends out in an arc giving more space and the double shower heads are great too. This is definitely a higher end hotel. Even though it is an older hotel the facilities are impeccably maintained. Things are expensive though. The hotel tacks on an $18 daily activities fee which includes two bottles of water, parking, use of the workout facilities (which are really wonderful) and a couple other things. The most critical is the parking since there is little parking available and nearby all parking is paid by the hour. The hotel is very heavily marketing the Westin Vacation Ownership packages so you need to sidestep this frequently, but there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any pressure to do a meeting, but you are exposed to it everywhere. (We actually bought a property and we went into it thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so they are good salespeople!) There are a few restaurants in the hotel. The O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122no Restaurant is OK and not terribly expensive, but there are better restaurants nearby. The Tropica sits looking out over the water and is a beautiful setting, but everyone (including hotel staff) told us the food wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that good and was very expensive. We avoided it. The poolside service (they bring the food to you) was excellent (Surf Salad, Thai chicken wings and hot dog were family favorites) and reasonably priced. The Westin has some kid friendly pricing so the purchase of one entr\u00c3\u00a9e gets a free kid meal (with good, varied selections) for a child 12 or under. We actually liked the Hula Grill which was next door at the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf. We ate the bar food (make sure to make reservations because the wait is long) and it was excellent. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the dining room food is as good, but it is more expensive and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary. Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, also next door to the hotel, and a sister restaurant to the Hula Grill, was AWFUL. Avoid it since it is expensive and the food mediocre and the service terrible. The only redeeming factor was the view. The Hula Grill has the same view, hula dancers and music and better food! We ate lunch our first day in Kahului at Las Pinatas of Maui. It is a family run place and everything is made from scratch, down to the salsa. The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced. Avoid Fiesta Time which we drove to and past since it looked rundown and not in the best area of town. We ate a fine dinner at David Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Lahaina. This is a classy restaurant with a beautiful dining room, excellent ambiance and wonderful food. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap, but it was well worth the money. The fish is particularly well done. Finally we called and got reservations over a month in advance for the Old Lahaina Luau. It was expensive, but well worth the cost. The location is prime with expansive views of the harbor and sunset. The bar is open and there is every kind of fruity mixed drink you can think of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and more. The help is nice and welcoming and the luau is very well organized at serving over 450 guests nightly. There are four buffet lines and tables are called up so you never stand in line. The entertainment starts after all the food is done and cleared and tells the story of the Polynesians coming to Hawaii. It is fascinating and beautifully performed. Make sure to make reservations well in advance. There was a list of 300 people who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in the night we went. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tour around much since there it was great fun hanging by the pool. One caveat is that there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that many pool lounge chairs and they fill up very quickly, particularly those under the small thatched umbrellas. Since we were on East Coast time when we got there I was up early and went down the first day to sit by the pool around 6:30am. Almost all the umbrella-covered seats were already taken! People come and put down towels or floats to hold the seats. The hotel policy is that if a seat isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t used over the course of an hour then the staff will take the property. I never saw that happen even to seats that were saved all day and the people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up until 3pm. It was totally obnoxious! So, if we planned on a pool day it was easier to get up early and have a relaxing hour down by the pool holding onto our lounge chairs. I will say the lounges were really, really comfortable so staying all day wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hardship. One day we scheduled a helicopter ride with Blue Hawaiian helicopters. We only went on the West Maui ride since it was expensive for a family of four. The kids really enjoyed it and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get sick at all. After the ride we were on the Road to Hana so we started down it. The AMEX booking office at the Westin will give you a two sided Xeroxed sheet called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Road to Hana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that includes markers so you can know where to stop along the way. You can also pick up a taped explanation in town. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t since we knew we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going the whole way. Be prepared, it is long and windy and it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear it is worth it! Wear a bathing suit and bring sunblock, bug spray and water shoes. Stop at the Maui Grown Market at mile marker 15 to get a very cost effective (with incredibly slow service) box lunch. For $8.50 you get a cold sandwich, drink, chips, two chocolate chip cookies (fresh baked), and a candy bar. You can also borrow a dog. Yes, a dog! There are dogs lying around and you can take one with you as a companion on the trip to Hana. Koa was especially cute and two families both wanted her. It was very funny! Our first stop was Twin Falls. There is a nice fruit stand and portapotties there. Put sun block and insect repellant on before you venture further. There are two waterfalls to hike to and then you can swim in the pools. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink the water since it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean (from animals upstream). We hiked in and took the right trail at the fork. It is about a 20 minute walk, mostly uphill and over some very narrow bridges and rock walls. The pool was some slippery rocks (from algae) so be careful getting in, but it is chest deep and very beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fairly warm. We backtracked and went down the left fork to the other waterfall. It is slightly closer, but you have to go through knee high water to reach the falls so wear shorts, not pants. This is a taller waterfall and the water is colder, but still very nice. Be careful of the surrounding rocks and tree limbs since they are covered with red clay that can stain your clothes (and is used by many shirt manufacturers as a selling point!). This was the highlight of our trip to Hana! We piled into the car and tried to stop at the Puohokamoa Stream, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it! The Kaumahina State Wayside Park is under construction so we continued on until we found a pretty, but small, pull off where we took pictures, ate lunch and looked at Honomanu Bay (a black sand beach) below. We then turned around and went back to the Westin. The girls got really nauseous in the car with all the bends and turns. There are many one lane areas where you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see what is coming so it is a bit scary! There is a fun Swap Meet in downtown Kahului on Saturday morning which has tons of shops selling food, gifts, local handiwork, flowers and tons more. You could easily spend two hours there. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat lunch, but the food smelled great and there was a long line. Parking can be a bit touch and entry costs $0.50 per person (kids are free). Our favorite purchase was home made Kettle Popcorn called Maui Kettle Korn. It was great and we easily ate through two huge bags. There are different flavors so try them all. By far and away, the favorite adventure of our time in Maui was parasailing with UFO Adventures off Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach (a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from the Westin). Our daughters didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weigh enough individually (130 pounds each) to go on their own so they flew tandem. My husband went on his own. They did the 800 ft package for 10 minutes in the air. They take you up, bring you down with your feet dangling in the water and then take you back up. The pictures from on high were amazing and we also bought the $20 roll of film from the onboard photographer since he had a telephoto lens. Very neat and they all can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to do it again. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get wet since you take off and land in the boat. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe too.

Parasailing, jet skiing, and snorkeling are all within walking distance. Whalers village is literally a 2 minute walk away, and provides a nice alternative to dining at the expensive hotel restaurants. Cute little shopping center, great for souvenirs. 2. Rooms: It doesn't get any better than the Heavenly Bed and the Heavenly Bath. Period. As Platinum Starwood members we were upgraded to an Ocean/Mountain view room, but either one overlooks some of the most amazing scenery - even the mountain view was gorgeous despite the fact that most people like the ocean better. Our room was cleaned regularly every day, and the facilities were in excellent condition. 3. Pool: Hands down, the best pool in West Maui. Several different pools connected by waterfalls, including an quieter adult pool/hot tub (enforced!) which can be a welcome break from the kids. Although a lot of adults, including myself, enjoyed the massive water slide as much as the kids did ;) This hotel caters to honeymooners and families alike. However if you are honeymooning and looking for a REALLY quiet place to stay, the Westin probably isn't for you. Try a hotel in Wailea, which has more private resorts.

My husband, daughter (16) and I stayed in a deluxe ocean view room. We paid $200 extra a night, but for the extra space, closet and the absolutely beautiful view of the ocean from a very spacious lani we got to enjoy anytime, it was well worth the money! My other family members would also agree, however they all liked their rooms just as well. The rooms are very simply stated with nice decor. Very comfortable. The heavenly beds are great. The shower is not anything to get overly excited about, but two shower heads spraying you at the same time certainly cuts back on the length of your shower and was a bit more relaxing...Our room was larger and we did have a roll away in it for the first three nights, but I would not suggest it for any other rooms as it would not fit. The smaller rooms do not have a closet, just a small area in the hutch. So, you put your suitcase on a stand and live out of it. They have plenty of extra luggage stands you just need to ask. No biggie! We ate dinner at the hotel the first night and although it is pricey, the food was very good and the ambiance could not have been any better. The live music, breeze from the ocean and the beautiful landscape, it must be a dream. My husband said the fish was the best he ate on the island. We did grab breakfast from the pool side eatery one morning when we were trying to get to the winery in a hurry and it was good. Pricey, but quick. The remaining days we ate at the food court next door. My sister did get a free breakfast buffet and said it was good and well worth the money if you are hungry and can eat a lot, but would not eat there again. There are too many other restaurants on Maui to eat anywhere more then once. The wonderful thing about The Westin is the beach, no other area like it on the island. It is right in front of you! Large white expanses of water and sand every where. The hotels and condos on this beach are connected by a brick walkway that runs parallel to the beach in front of the hotels and shops at Whalers village. It was fantastic to walk or run as many do in the early morning hours. And that is also when it is least crowded! I just can't say enough about the hotel...walking distance to Whalers for breakfast, lunch, dinner, shopping and the service. Most activities can be accessed from the beach. My daughter and husband went parasailing. My family went to black rock to snorkel. We went to the luau at the Hyatt. And we walked to all these places!! At night we would sit on the Lanai, enjoy the breeze off the ocean, and listen to the live music from the restaurant below and the excitement from the passerby's on the boardwalk! We loved the ambiance of the hotel, very festive! I attached pictures and hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed taking them! Activities we did together or separately and would do again... Snorkel black rock, Snorkel with the turtles/dolphins, visit Maui Ocean Center, Play on the Beach, Take in a Luau, Go Parasailing, Horseback riding, Zip Lining, visit the winery and take the tour, Go shopping in Lahina, Lay on the beach, Lay by the pool, Relax, Relax, Relax... Might do it again...Maui tropical plantation, sugar cane train, Hana, the summit at the crater. Places to eat that the whole family enjoyed...Bubba Gumps, Hard Rock, BJ's Pizza, the hotel, Whalers Village (lots of restaurants)! And although we tried several times and could not get reservations for Mama's Fish House, we heard it is the place to go! Now to the very few negatives of the hotel and our trip. The rollaways are uncomfortable...My sister said her room was dirty. For some reason her room is always dirty! Go figure. But they did give her 4 free breakfast coupons and \"re-cleaned\" her room right away. The hotel has a resort fee and the Internet access is included in this fee. My sister could not get their Internet access to work and had to use dial up (Our internet access worked great in our room!). They were charged . 99 for every 800 call they made. Several per day. Once they explained this to the front desk, their bill was credited. There are plenty of pool chairs but you must get yours early as they are normally all taken by 11 o'clock. You are not allowed to save chairs and someone must use their chair every 30 minutes or so in order for you to keep it. The hotel staff does walk around and take chairs away. We did go at the busiest time of the year so it may be different other times. That is it for the hotel...not bad eh? Do not recommend the submarine trip if you are going to snorkel or go to the Maui Ocean Center. The submarine ride does not do justice to the magnificent color of the coral or the different variety of fish you can find doing the other two activities. Do not do Hana or the crater's summit if you have motion sickness or trouble breathing (crater). And other then that, we would go back in a heartbeat and will stay at the Westin every time!!", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cWestin Maui Is The Best In Kaanapali\u201d", "Author": "Bob_LSanJose_CA", "ReviewID": "UR3782523", "Content": "Why is it the best in Kaanapali?

I'm convinced, after the stay, that there are people posting at this site simply for the purpose of trashing Westin; the same is true for reviews of the Sheraton. During my stay on Maui (which concluded with 2 days at the Four Seasons in Wailea), I had a chance to visit nearly all the big resorts on the island (excluding only the Ritz and the Maui Prince). I'll tell you my impressions of all of them, but let me begin with the Westin. Overall, the Westin is the best place to stay on Ka'anapali Beach (which, in turn, is the best place to stay on Maui). I must admit, I didn't turn on the TV during my stay, so I can't speak to how many TV channels are available. And the rooms are not decorated particularly memorably. If you care about these things, look elsewhere. And yes, there are lots of children -- shocking, finding children on Maui in August! The pool at the Westin is the prettiest on Maui, overall. I think it compares favorably to the much-hyped pool at the Grand Wailea. The Waterslide is decent. The many waterfalls to stand under are very fun. The adult pool is peaceful, if you're looking for that. Personally, I don't like to sit by the pool all day in Hawaii -- I do that at home in Virginia -- but if you do, this is the best place to do so on Ka'anapali beach. The lounges are nicer than at the Hyatt, Sheraton, or Marriot, and there is (slightly) more space; the people appear less packed in. The chocolate monkey drink at the bar is delicious, and the poolside restaurant decent enough. (Hyatt lacks a poolside restaurant with table service; instead there is a food court -- but try those onion rings!). The beach in front of the Westin is fabulous. The sandy expanse is big and the waves. The Marriot and the Hyatt have practically no beach at all; everyone sits poolside, or on the grass. (They do have hammocks at the Hyatt, and that was a nice treat.) One irksome thing about the Westin is that they charge $5 for a lounge chair on the beach each day -- I do not understand how they make enough money off this to compensate for the lack of good will). Service was good. Everyone was very friendly. We had a personal concierge who was very helpful, but they were all able to give advice as far as restaurants. We loved the wildlife. We were upgraded free from mountainview to deluxe ocean view. The view of the ocean was great, but we could also look back at the mountains, and that too was spectacular -- a rainbow every night. Heavenly bed. Heavenly shower. Perfect location for a home base. I cannot understand those who complain. Of course, for $200 more per night, you could be at the Four Seasons in Wailea. Here they have thought of everything. Housekeeping folds your clothes. They heat the pool to bathwater after about 5 PM, so you can watch the sun set in the pool. An amazing drink called the Maui Orchid takes the edge off. Even the thing to clean the sand off your feet has heated water. Free valet parking. They bring you water and pineapples and strawberries on the beach. Still... there was something about the Four Seasons that was... not as fun as the Westin. Maybe it was the other guests. I didn't witness anyone horrible, but I just didn't feel as friendly an atmosphere. Certainly, I prefer the Ka'anapali location, with easy access to Lahaina and Kapalua, to Wailea with easy access to charmless Kihei and its fast food strip feel. And I was actually bothered by the expense of the food. $18 was the most I've ever paid for a burger, but it wasn't the best burger. (Overall, Maui's burgers disappointed me; I ate one nearly every day, and none stands out). I don't know when I will return to Maui. I loved it, but I've been there three times and done almost everything. But when I do, I will be staying at the Westin.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blue Point, NY", "Title": "\u201cReally Enjoyed the Westin!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3720780", "Content": "My husband and I went to Maui for our 5 year anniversary.

In the end it is taken off your card unless you use a debit card like we did, and it was take right out of our account on the second day of our vacation.

I was happy that I had used airline miles to pay for our stay, because the bill would have been $2800 for the seven nights. The hotel was extremely average. But what really disappointed us was the indifference of the staff. Only once during out stay did we encounter someone who went out of his way to be friendly and greet us. I expected a higher level of friendliness and hospitality. That indifference carried through just about every aspect of the hotel. The housekeeping, valet parking, restaurant staff, concierge, front desk staff, gift store staff, and others seemed to forget that they were working in the \"hospitality\" industry. I felt the $18 a day charge for parking, internet access, the fitness center, a 4x6 photo, and a souvenir shopping bag was unfair. If the hotel management feels it must charge an extra fee, they should build it into the room rate. I think if they are charging $400 a night they should not nickle and dime the guests for $18 more per night. We asked for the souvenir bag and they were \"out for two weeks.\" We were not offered anything in exchange. A $20 gift shop credit would have been a nice gesture. I would have probably taken it and spent $40 on some sort of tote bag. We were disappointed with the dining choices (no atmosphere, unremarkable food, poor service) and the lack of shopping on site. There was only one gift store (sundries and souvenirs) and one small clothing shop. I expected the Westin to be a big resort with lots of fun and tempting on-site shopping. I feel that when you stay at a resort, part of the experience is the inclusion of ammeneties like special shops. The hotel seemed more interested in dedicating space to timeshare sales. Our room was on the second floor very close to the hotel's large fountain. The roar of the water was very loud 24 hours a day. One high point was the beauty salon staff. I had a make-up trial appointment and a two-hour hair and make-up appointment. They did do a nice job, but were a bit rushed during the hair and make-up appointment (it was prior to our wedding vow renewal, so it was an important appointment for me).

We spent a few days at the Hyatt Regency Kauai, a few days at the 4 seasons in Maui (wailea) and a few days at the Westin. The places are so different, that it is a bit of an unfair comparison, but, here goes. Relative to Kaui, Maui is crowded. Maui (and Ka'anapali especially) is like New York City - people everywhere, all the time. What is interesting is how the hotels handled the crowds. The 4 seasons did a great job. . . it seemed busy, but, never intrusive. The Westin was jammed, and it was hard to find a lounge chair. There was not much romantic about the westin. . . .very little to offer in terms of peace and quiet. The westing doesn't feel personal, quiet or charming. . . it's a nice place, but, its crowded. The pool at the westin is top notch, relaxing, fun, with many diversions. They do a good job at keeping the adult pool for adults, and I believe kids enjoy all the things to do in the all ages pool. The servers and the food is good, and at a comparable price to everything else on the island. Kaanapali beach is great, but, very crowded. We spent some time in the Spa, which is new, and actually very nice - easily comparable to the 4 seasons of the Hyatt on kauai. The location of the westin is good too. . . right next to whalers village, which, really expands the 'easy' dinner/drink options. The downer is the hotel building itself.

And though we were only on the 5th floor, we considered ourselves lucky to be upgraded, considering the price of these rooms for people that actually have to pay for them. You do get what you pay for. The view was fantastic and we enjoyed the man-made waterfall/white noise to the chatter we'd have heard coming from the pool otherwise. Our room was clean, very cool and our bed was Heavenly as well. The fridge was small but kept my drinks cool. The spa is great too - with another outstanding view of the ocean. We enjoyed the adult pool and had an easy time finding space to sit - in the sun or shade. The beaches in Hawaii are all public, so anyone can use them for their enjoyment. That's wonderful when you want to spend an afternoon at the Kapalua Ritz-Carleton, so don't complain when you have to share the beauty with others...we did not find the beach crowded and the water was so warm and calm it was like bath water. Another review talked about how the \"TV had nothing on.\" Are you kidding? So sorry to hear you take vacations to watch TV - there were probably about 30 cable TV channels in my room - something for everyone, even kids. And as for the parking - use the valet! If the parking lot is full, they'll valet for free! If you can't afford the $2 tip find somewhere else to stay. The men at the Valet station were great - they even carried a trunk-load of groceries up to our room - immediately. If you treat people right, they'll be helpful. In all, it was a wonderful resort. When we go back to Maui we will stay at the Westin again. Its location (next to Whalers' Village - good shopping and food), beach and pools were far superior to other resorts we looked at.", "Date": "June 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Westin!\u201d", "Author": "soccrgrl", "ReviewID": "UR3526980", "Content": "My family of 4, stayed at the Westin from 5/24-5/31.

The room was clean and had a fridge and safe. If I had to \"nitpick\" about anything, it would be the lack of a closet. You have a small space inside an armore to hang your clothes. With a family of 4, things did get a little tight. But, we were basically only in our rooms to sleep and take showers! Service was great, no lines at check in or really for anything, although the hotel was completely booked. The self parking lot was full most of the time, but they did valet park us for free, if the lot was full. You will not find a better beach location! We basically explored the entire island, and decided that the Westin had the best location, and beach/pool area.

We checked out the Sheraton and Hyatt and there was no comparison to the Westin. The grounds were beautiful with palm trees everywhere and a multitude of waterfalls. We had an ocean view room in the Ocean Tower and the room was great. I read many reviews saying the rooms were too small with little closet space. We had three people staying in a room and didn't seem to have any trouble. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was fine. There was a refrigerator in the room which kept enough stuff for all three of us. The lanai was spacious and provided plenty of room to sit back and relax and enjoy the view. After our first night, we received a free box of maui chocolates from the concierge. I thought this was a nice touch. The service was great and the employees were very hospitable and accomodating. The concierge was very helpful in planning our stay. They provided maps and offered suggestions. The hotel is right next door to Whaler's Village which was a plus and the restaurant selection around the hotel was superb. We ate at the Hula Grill which was great. We sat outside and ate while taking in the fantastic views of the sunset. The hotel also offers an activities desk right next to the beach which allows you to book excursions. The beach in front of the hotel was great. It wasn't quite as wide as it was in front of the Sheraton; however, it was perfect for us. After checking out the beach in front of the Hyatt, we were glad we didn't stay there. Parking was difficult at times and we had to valet twice while we were there; however, we didn't let that bother us. When you are in Hawaii, you can't expect to get by cheap. Otherwise, we would of probably stayed at a cheaper location. Overall, I wouldn't stay anywhere else on Kaanapali. I certainly don't understand any of the negative reviews and I would recommend this place to anyone. I would definitely stay here again when I go back. It is laid back, yet it has enough happening if you want to do something (without having to drive too far). If you are picky about the trivial details, then the Four Seasons or Ritz might be better choices.

The trip was in celebration of our 25th Anniversary. Have to say that we were very pleased with our overall experience. Here are some of my thoughts: At the bargain rate, we were not expecting to be placed in a great room. However, we were not disappointed. Our room was on the 6th floor in the Ocean Tower. We were above the parking lot, but had a great view of the golf course. Despite the parking lot, noise was not a problem. We were in our room mainly to shower & sleep. Rooms are average size and not small as indicated in previous posts. The armoire has 2 very deep drawers and a very narrow closet and also serves to hold the TV. It was quite adequate for our 5 night stay. The bed and pillows were indeed heavenly...no sore back or stiff necks. Definitely the best hotel bed we've ever slept in. Bathroom was fine, too, altho' I'm not sure why they call their showers \"heavenly.\" Basically you get two vertically placed shower heads, so there is double the water being used to shower. I remember when Maui was suffering from a drought! It was nice having the mini-fridge and safe in the room. Judging by the occupied poolside lounge chairs and filled parking lot, the hotel was pretty packed. Yes, it can get crowded by the pool, so best to plan to be there early if you want a prime spot. We only had to repark our car 3 times after we checked in, and never had a problem finding a spot. We liked it there so much, that we rarely left the hotel. Whaler's Village is only steps away so you easily walk there in under 5 minutes. For dining there's Hula Grill, Lelani's and a food court. There's even an ABC store for sundries. snacks, drinks & inexpensive souvenirs. We only had one meal (dinner) at Ono's at the hotel. It was delicious, but pricey, as is most hotel dining. Decided to dine tapa-style and ended up spending $72 for two of us (and we are not big eaters!). Also had meals at Hula Grill & Leilani's at Whaler's Village which were only fair. Our best meal was at Roy's in Kahana. The concierge secured reservations on the night we requested. Great workout facility with a great view. The three times we went it was not crowded, altho' it can be. There were also apples & protein bars in a basket if we needed a snack. Customer service was excellent, no lines, no waiting for anything....check-in, check-out, pool towels, restaurant, concierge service and even the elevator! The staff provided excellent recommendations, also. Upon taking the advice of a bell hop, we saved quite a bit on golf club rentals. The girl at the front desk directed us to a great place near the Kahului airport to have a homestyle Hawaiian breakfast ($8 for two, including coffee) before we flew home. Although they were not pushy in regards to touring their new property, we decided to see it anyways. Went for a continental breakfast at 9am and didn't leave until almost noon. My hubby was all set to buy into their property, but I wasn't comfortable with spending $27,000+! They did give us a $100 certificate for our time which we applied to our hotel bill and a voucher for 50% off rack rate for a future stay at any Starwood property. I think fair enough for listening to their sales pitch for 3 hours. We probably could have left earlier had my hubby not been so enthusiastic! All in all, we left the Westin quite happy.

We used Starwood points to get the rooms. We get 2 per night due to having 2 teenagers. We made reservations 7 months in advance. We are Starwood Gold members and have stayed in very, very nice accomodations before. We have also had our days of stays in Holiday Inn's, Ramada\"s and Super 8's. We have moved up in taste from those to the Westin's, Sheraton's, Luxury Collections, Four Points and such. We checked in and orginally were given 2 rooms overlooking the front entry area/parking lot - facing inland. We asked to be upgraded being Gold members (a perk) and were given one room upgrade but had to keep the kids in the parking lot view room. When we went up to the 4th floor room for us, we opened the door and a wall of heat hit us. We tried to turn on the air to cool it down, no big deal. Then we found out why. We walked out onto the balcony and if you were to step over the rail, you would step onto the roof of the connecting buiding. They were tarring the roof right outside our room. The view would of been of the side of the tower building that the roof we overlooked connected to our tower building. If you looked to the left you could see about 5 feet of ocean view. We called the Starwood Gold front desk (they have their own check-in desk where you don't have to wait in line) and requested a different room. There was someone different there and they gave us a room down the hall. The room had a much better view which was of palm trees and bushes just outside our balcony. If you looked down to the right, you looked at the Koi, swan, flamingo pond that you first see when coming into the hotel. We could see some ocean between the trees. We did get to see some sunsets so the view was upgraded. The room was a different story. The minute we opened the door, the musty, moldy smell hit us. We also noticed makeup on one of the pillows. We called the express services to tell them these things. A couple hours later they sent up maids that brought new sheets and they changed out our entire bed. I mentioned that I thought the smell was the carpet and asked if they had recently shampooed it. They nodded yes, and made a phone call to someone-they talked in a language we didn't understand so I don't know what was being said. I think that they would agree with anything that I suggested was causing the smell because they didn't know where it was coming from either. Several hours later a man with a spray bottle of a chemical came up and sprayed a few places on the carpet. It worked...for about 1 day then the smell returned, as strong as ever. We decided to go to the local store and buy Fabreeze and keep spraying it until we could leave. We didn't want to keep complaining because it would get us maybe to a worse room. The toilet had to be flushed twice each time because if not, it would clog up. We put up with that - we aren't paying the water bill. The t.v. had really nothing on. Mostly Starwood sales information and local tourist information. There wasn't a variety of programs at all and t.v. seemed like a waste. The bed has seen it's last days. It is time for the hotel to replace it. It doesn't have the soft luxurious feel that other Westin Heavenly beds have. It didn't have that sink down in pillow top feel that we know the Heavenly bed has. The hotel staff takes several hours to deliver a requested item whereas at other resorts/hotels we are use to receiving it within an hour. The Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort & Villa's deliver items within about 5-10 minutes! It took two phone calls to get a lightbulb for our desk lamp at the Wesin Maui and the second time no one knew if it was being delivered or not. The Westin Maui is an older hotel. It is very, very beautiful if you see if from the lobby. The rooms leave much to be desired and the hotel has so many people walking about that it reminds me of a shopping mall at Christmas time (amount of people). You have to fight to get a spot anywhere. The beach was very, very crowed and I likened it to Wakiki Beach. There were people just feet from us. I have kids and in no way do we dislike them but were next to people that had a young boy. He was about 3 and kept making \"beeping\" noises every 2 seconds that went on for a good 5 to 7 minutes. The parents didn't bother to avert his attention to something else or try to get him to stop making the annoying noise. They had no care in the world if they were bothering the people next to them or not. They were the sort of people that you meet in a lower cost/type hotel. Their was also a group of people (8) that were drinking beer, cussing, talking about everyone and smoking by us. We rented a covered cabana for one day and there were no others to rent. We had to stay where we were. They were also the type of people that you see at the lower cost hotels. I know the hotel cannot control this but it just added to the dislike of our surroundings. If you enjoy lots of people, crowed pools, scoping out a vacant seat/plot of sand and older rooms then you may enjoy this hotel. For us, we like way, way less people, more personal service that makes us feel like we are the only ones there and cleaner/newer rooms. I don't like taking my little 6 foot wide space of sand on the beach and sharing the rest with everyone else and not being able to move if I want. We like quiet, clean, uncrowded beaches and feel like we have experienced so many different resorts/hotels that we have finally learned what a true, relaxing vacation is.", "Date": "May 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Texas", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "texasbeez", "ReviewID": "UR3512442", "Content": "The pool area was amazing with several pools and waterfalls.

We arrived to find that there was a prom being held that night and there wasn't a parking spot to be found. In all fairness they did valet park us for free unless you count the tip they still expected. Throughout our 6 night stay parking continued to be a huge hassle. The slots are not even big enough for a standard car much less a mini-van. I think they should take that $18 a day resort fee and build a parking ramp. We went to see the sunrise at Haleakala and needed to leave at 3 a.m. one morning. When we got to our cars we found that valet parking had double parked all of us in. We had to wait for someone to find all the keys to the cars that were in the way and move them. At check-in we asked for a roll-out cot for our daughter. (There is no space in the room for a sleeper sofa.) Before leaving the hotel in the evening we called again as a reminder and were told not to worry. When we got back from the Whaler Village still no bed. It took 3 more calls of being told it would be there (an hour later still no bed and a very tired 7 year old asleep in our bed.) Finally after having had enough we finally got ahold of a manager and had a bed in a matter of minutes. (My brother went through the same ordeal with his bed request) The rooms are not very big and storage is very minimal. We put our dd's items in the night stand drawers. Our fridge was very small and seemed to be putting out heat not cold. The fridge in my mom's room was twice as big and worked fine (she had a double bed room). The bed was very nice with a super fluffy comforter. The bathrooms are okay. Not as spectacular as they want you to think but okay nonetheless. They do give high end toiletries which do have a very strong scent. We did get our daily water bottles. They say it is complimentary but remember that is also what your $18 resort fee is supposed to cover. Wireless is included which my dh loved. The grounds were simply gorgeous!! We were on the 7th floor with an ocean front view and it was truly stunning. One thing I probably would have preferred was the sound of the ocean vs. the overwhelming sound of the manmade waterfall, especially at night. The end of March was an extremely windy time. This made for some disappointments when it came to whale watching and going to Molokini. Due to school schedules this was the only time we could go but be forewarned the weather at this time is not what we dreamed of when we thought of Hawaii. We had no problems with the towel lines at the pool as they moved very quickly. More difficult was getting a chair anywere at the pool. Pretty much I let my child go swim within sight and I scouted out a seat or waited for someone to leave. It was the week after Easter so I expected this and tried not to get to cranky about it. The staff was enforcing the rule about losing your chair if it is left unoccupied for more then 30 minutes. They also did a very good job of keeping chairs open to guests only. My dd loved the huge snow cones they sold at the poolside food counter. It is a bit of a stroll down to Black Rock but not really bad at all. It is close to many restaurants and stores. We also went to Safeway and got basic groceries. Since our fridge was crummy we had to borrow some space in my mom's. My SIL signed up for a Safeway discount card and then we all took turns using it. It was a nice perk going down to the Sheraton to use their pool . We liked the Westin's a whole lot better but it was nice to have options. I would say that I saw more Sheraton visitors at the Westin pool then vice-versa. (you can tell by the color of the arm bands). My dd wanted a hair braid and when I inquired about them I was very rudely told that I needed to call the hair salon if I wanted an appt. If they don't want to talk to people then why not put out a sign explaining how it all works?

This time we chose to stay at The Westin Maui. I have to say that I do not understand all the negative reviews about this resort. I was raised a spoiled child and became use to the finer things in life, and the Westin Maui is no exception. If you are traveling with a family, and you are worried about the amount of space in your room, then I suggest you get a condo. The rooms are not large, but they are also not small by any means. They are average size hotel rooms. You are not paying a premium price for the size of the room, you are paying for the location and the amenities, namely the pools. We paid for an ocean view room and boy did we get it. On the 10th floor with a knock out view of the ocean and the pools. Garden view rooms be aware; waterfalls are on all night, and they are quite loud. With the door closed, you will barely hear them. For those that say they paid discount internet prices on some website and were given the cheapest room in the category you paid for, well what did you expect? Those of us who paid top dollar should get the better rooms. Ever heard the saying \"You get what you pay for\"? Anyway, the rooms are very comfortable, but for a family of four, I could see how they might feel small. They were perfect for the 2 of us. The rooms in the Beach Tower are a bit larger, but not much. They also come at a premium price, and I felt our view in the Ocean Tower was better, unless you get an ocean front suite. The bathrooms are a bit small, but not surprised for the age of the resort. The armoir was perfect for us. We had enough space to hang everything we needed to hang, and had ample drawer space for the 2 of us. Again, in the Beach Tower, you get a full closet. The shower heads were a little low for someone tall like myself so I had to duck to get the head wet, but the showers were fine otherwise. We had the air set to 65 the entire stay, and during the day it would stay at about 71, and at night it would stay at around 67. It never did get to 65, but it was also quite hot outside. The beds were very comfortable. No compaints there either. As for the pools, what can I say? There are no pools like them in Kaanapali. The adults pool was great for someone without children, and it was more like an adult area with a pool, hot tub, pool table and a bar. There was security to keep the kids away as well. The other 4 pools were great as well, and perfect for families of all ages. The slide was a ton of fun, and the pools were a perfect temp. The hotter it got outside, the colder the pools felt because of your changing body temp. But once the sun went down, you could tell they were heated. They were quite warm, actually. We did eat at the breakfast buffet a few times, and it was pretty good. There were a lot of options to choose from. It was really as good as it can get for pre-made food. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel other that the occasional snack by the pool, as we wanted to eat at other restaurants around the Island. The drinks by the pool were small and watered down for $8.25, and don't bother with the daily drink special as it is $7.75, a mere 50 cents cheaper. The pools did get quite crowded, but not a problem if you are an early riser. The beach in front of the hotel is great, and it gets even better up towards the Sheraton. We never had a problem with the customer service, but again we were always nice and didn't complain about every little thing, and always managed to have a smile on our face. I would imagine they get quite sick of people complaining to get better rooms when they got what they paid for. We never got hasseled by the timeshare salespeople, but be aware that when you get an invitation to come to get your free gift, it will come with a sales pitch. We were aware of this ahead of time, and choose not to go and get our 2 dollar box of chocolate. If you are a gold or platinum starwood member, you will also get a invitiation to a managers cocktail party, and we chose not to attend that either, and assumed it came with a sales pitch as well. Stay away from those 2 things and you will not have a problem. For those who talked about the ongoing painting, rest assures it is all done now. They are just improving the hotel for all of us to enjoy. Would you rather them shut it down while they are complaining? The Westin Maui is no longet pink, it is white now.

This was our 2nd time to Maui, & our 2nd time at the Westin. We enjoyed the 1st time which was in 2001 and I was a bit hesitant after reading the reviews from people on this trip to even stay there. I got a decent rate for being a Starwood Resorts Gold Member (join - it doens't cost anything to do so). It was $260 a night with the 6th night free (we stayed 9 nights there) plus we got 35% off our meals (only lunch & dinner) from their 2 restaurants. When we arrived we were given a room on the 9th floor of the Ocean Tower facing the mountains & parking lot. When we went into the room, someone was already in there. We went back to the front desk, the girl seemed very surprised about someone being in there so she gave us another room, on the 8th floor, facing mountains, and she said for our inconvienence she would drop the $18 daily resort fee which saved us about $160. That was fine by me. I will admit, the rooms are small, but they are clean & functional and the beds are comfortable. Feather pillows- not those hard foam ones everyone else gives you, down comforters, not the bright colored polyester quilted ones everyone else has. The bathrooms are small, the shower heads are a bit big for the size of the tub, but they work well. I usually never hang up my clothes on vacation, I keep them in my bag folded until I wear them, so the tiny armoire everyone complained about didn't bother me. I didn't hear any noise from the parking lot as others said they did. We never had to wait long for an elevator. I had heard the Beach tower had bigger rooms, we checked them out but I didnt think they warrented $130 more a night for a little more room. The pool area can get a bit crowded at times. If you want a spot in the shade, you have to go down early in the morning and put a bag or something on the chair you want. By 9am most of the decent chairs are taken, but alot of people dont stay all day so you can usually get one that you desire (except for under the umbrella thing). There are alot of kids there but you can sit at the adult pool if you want some quiet. We sat at the main pool and it was fine. I think the pool chairs could be situated a little better - not so close to the one next to it, but I guess with so many people staying there, they want as many chairs as they can fit on the pool deck. You can go down to the Sheraton & use their facilities like the pool, but the walkway in front of the hotels doesn't go all the way to the Sheraton- you have to walk out on the beach to get to it, so I found that a bit inconvenient. I think more people from the Sheraton came to use the Westin pool than the other way around. They had a buffet there back in 2001 that was very good but they dont have it anymore- too bad). We only ate at their restaurants once for lunch and once for dinner at Ono's . I wasn't too pleased with the dinner choices at either place. They wanted $25 per person for the breakfast buffet which I though was way too much. Alot of people did eat there I noticed but most of them had Breakfast coupons that they got with whatever package they booked. We opted to eat at the Marriott for breakfast- French toast w/bacon or sausage for $8.75 which I thought was very reasonable or we went to Mc Donalds foir pancackes. I would rather spend money on a nice dinner than on breakfast. We tried dinner at the Marriott- all you can eat crab legs- STAY AWAY. That was terrible & expensive. The Hyatt had a nice dinner at Cascades, although I asked for one thing and got another. The waiter seemed a bit annoyed- but he brought me what I ordered finally. We did eat at Hula Grill & the sister restaurant across the way Leighlanis. Stay away from The Rusty Harpoon in the Whalers Village (that came for the locals). Kimos in Lahaina had excellent Halibut- we ate there twice. Also tried Ruth Chris Steakhouse- very good. If you want to know where to eat or have a question about a restaurant, ask a local store owner or whatever. That's what we did if we weren't sure. Over all I was pleased once again with the Westin & their staff. We did have one day when the room wasn't cleaned until about 4pm, but other than that it was fine. The were in the process of moving the gift shop to near the elevators which makes it much eaiser from where it used to be. The parking situation - the parking lot is small and so are the parking spaces. One side of a row is for compact cars, the other for bigger ones. So you get a big car parking in a compact space, which results in taking up 2 spaces- theres the problem. We only had to valet park the car once because the lot was full (they double park them ) We were never approached by a time share/vacation club person there so I can't comment on that. I think for the price I was given ($260 a night) it was a good choice. (I know the Hyatt is $350 - $400 & up a night. ) If you can get a good rate for it, I would recommend staying here. I don't think I would pay $350 a night for it, (the Four Seasons in Kapalua charged that).

It was an expensive trip for us, but we felt that we couldn't go wrong in Maui. Maui did not fail us. It's a beautiful place to unwind and relax. It's perhaps not the best place for partygoers. The place seems to shut down around 10 pm or so and we were there with lots of young families (but they weren't noisy or obnoxious) and retired folks. If you're looking for peace and quiet, this is where to find it. The hotel was average, although the scenery was amazing from the 4th tower. The hotel is made up of about 6 towers so if you're in the farthest tower, be prepared to do a lot of walking between the lobby and/or parkade to your room EVERY DAY. The rooms weren't anything specatular, which was a bit disappointing. Our room had a small balcony, which was great in the mornings because you could walk out into direct sunlight. Our hotel package did not include breakfast, so we shopped at the local Safeway and had cereal and fruit every morning on the balcony. The only annoying thing was having our neighbours' cigar smoke drift our way some of the mornings. We also went at an unusually windy time in Maui. When we strolled along the beach in the afternoons, large gusts of wind would wind up blowing into our eyes and hair if we were sunbathing. It's a bit more expensive, but it's worth booking either one of the canopies (get there early in the a.m.!) or even an umbrella stand (be mindful the wind doesn't blow it on to you ...). Rent a car, because you'll need it unless all you intend to do is stay in the hotel all day long. The roads are windy and require some care during the evening, but there's plenty to do with a car, driving about 20 minutes out from the resort area. You'll find great eats, boutiques and art galleries on Front Street. Lots of small shopping centres (but power shoppers - you'll be disappointed. There is no Ala Moana style shopping centre here, most of the stuff is not worth buying nor can bargains be found). We also attended a luau at the Hyatt hotel, which was fun although the entertainment was quite cheesy. The beach by the hotel was not the best for boogie boarding or even surfing. Not enough waves - but really good for snorkeling. If you're looking to save some money while in Maui, here are a few tips. There's a fast food court in Whaler's Village, which is about 5 minutes walking distance from the Westin where you can find cheap, universal fast food (e.g. McDonald's). You can also pick up small items at any ABC store - we loaded up on water, soda, and snacks. If you have a unit with a kitchen, you can probably find everything at Safeway. Whatever you do, avoid eating in the hotel. The average cost per person (regardless of breakfast, lunch or dinner) seemed to be about $30. You can get a really great meal on Front Street for far less than that per person. If you're planning on spending more than two hours at the beach, consider booking a canopy or umbrella. They tend to get booked quickly (especially with families) so if you're making it a full day at the beach, might as well book it and have it for the day. On a scale of 1 - 10, I would rate my experience as an 8. There is plenty to see, do, and experience in Maui and you will definitely return home more relaxed. For single travellers, this is an ideal getaway if you really just want some R & R for yourself and in a safe, secure environment.

Another good thing about the Westin is that they allow their guests to use the amenities of their sister property, the Sheraton, up the beach a bit at not cost. There were some negatives however and I feel compelled to point them out: 1) The rooms at the Westin are very, very small, especially those in the ocean tower (better views than the beach tower, though) and the armoire in the ocean tower gives you only 16 inches of closet space (my husband measured)! 2) The Westin is intent on selling its timeshare property up the road and makes all the concierges subtly push attending an \"introductory tour\" of the place. If you say no, they do not insist, but the next time you visit to ask a question about another service (e.g, a spa treatment or snorkeling trip), they will try again to get you to do their timeshare thing.

The pool area is great...lots of interconnecting areas, waterfall, a large waterslide, etc. We were booked in a room with two double beds....definitely not a good idea with two children along. Unfortunately, there were no two room suites available. As mentioned, this trip was booked with no planning whatsoever after our cruise was unexpectedly cancelled. The bathroom was great...very large and spacious with lots of shelves for toiletries. We had a nice side-ocean view. Our bedroom area was nice, although nothing special. Both my husband and I did not feel that there was a pleasant smell to the beds/bedding...quite frankly, they did not smell fresh. The elevators were often a problem with very slow service or several out of service completely. I heard many other people complaining about this problem. The health club was quite nice with separate tv's and headphones for each piece of equipment. There were several pieces of equipment out of order, however. The entrance to the spa/gym area is pretty and serene with a \"wall of water\". I did not have a spa treatment, but I did have a polish change service. My nail technician did a very good job, although I believe that I was over-charged according to the price list which I saw. We dined in both the poolside casual restaurant as well as the more elaborate dinner restaurant. We were happy with all of the food and service. The breakfast buffet was very good. Probably the biggest advantage to staying here, if you have kids, is that they can eat for free with paying adults. This was a real savings as the cost of everything in Hawaii is high. The hotel also offered a \"grab and go\" option for bagels, cereal, etc. in the restaurant/lobby area, although these items are very over-priced. The beach area in front of the hotel is pretty and there is a nice walkway as well. We had two big problems....our camera was stolen, including all of our photos from a pre-trip in San Francisco. We believe that my husband left it in the car and it was subsequently stolen out of an unlocked, valet-parked car. My 8 year old also had his security blanket from birth taken along with the bedding when the housekeepers provided service. We notified them immediately. This blanket had his name and birthday monogrammed into it and someone must have just thrown it away. There is no excuse for them to not have been able to find and return this very valuable piece of sentiment to our family. I would also consider staying in Wailea over West Maui.

We stayed at the Westin Maui Deluxe Ocean Front Rooms, for four nights April 2-6 on our multi island hopping trip. Let me first tell you this Hotel is a cash cow. First off, they charge you a ton of money for the rooms, the least they could do is wipe off that silly daily resort fee. Two bottles of water and parking does not equate to that fee. If you want to waste more money, by all means enjoy the food at the hotel, but luckily the hotel is next door to the Whalers Village which offers plenty of food choices. The bathrooms are by no means heavenly, a double shower head which is fixed in position. Our toilet almost fell over, seems like the plumber forgot to bolt it in the ground. They only included one bathrobe in the room so my wife was able to enjoy that. The vanity was very nice. Included the usual accessories, but also had a lighted magnifying mirror and plenty of bottled stuff women love. The refrigerator was a bit tiny, but we were able to keep some food and drinks in there. The room also has a safe to lock your valuables inside. The bed was very comfortable. This is not the bed for those who would prefer a firm bed or an extremely soft mattress. The duvet cover was a bit much, unless you like to sweat in your sleep. We had to keep adjusting the thermostat because the AC kept going back to Auto- mode when we wanted to keep the air moving. We had to keep it set at 64 deg. for the room to stay at 72 deg. There is no closet in the room for hanging formal wear, not that you really need formal wear in Hawaii. They provide you with a Dresser / Chest that includes two drawers, one for you, and one for her and about 1' rack to hang your clothes. The hotel is decorated beautifully with the open lobby facing a tropical pool with waterfalls, fish, flamingos, and if it's not to windy, the parrots will be outside on their perches. The pools are pretty, but it can be a bit crowded. The beach is very nice and provides excellent views for whale watching and the neighboring islands of Molokai and Lanai. Over all I would give this resort 3.5 stars, everything about the hotel is wonderful until you walk into your room, then you may become greatly disappointed. I hardly spent any time at the hotel since there was too much too see and too little time while on Maui. This resort is for perfect for people who love cruise ships, crowds, and lines.

We apologize for the inconvenience.\" Do I really care about \"our future stays?\" I am a Starwood Gold member; only because of that did they move one of our three rooms to the \"Beach Tower.\" You see....they had many groups and were sold out. Well, you do not do exterior painting during the high season; you simply close off a portion of the hotel and paint/repair in September-October. But painting crews charge more in low-season. The rooms in the old tower are ludicrously small and you cannot get maid-service it seems before 5PM, even if you call \"service express.\" In the \"Beach Tower,\" however, the rooms are cleaned early and even turned down. It seems like you must pay for an Ocean View to get \"Heavenly Service\" in Maui. The beds may be \"Heavenly,\" but surely some of the mattresses haven't been changed in years. I have never experienced a more uncomfortable bed at a Westin. However, the Spa at the Westin is spectacular. Everyone in our group had an amazing treatment. Jon, the Spa concierge is a sweetie, and Kelly my masseuse was wonderful. I was surprised, however, that one of the spa assistants said that it would be \"too difficult\" to lower the temperature of the men's whirlpool. It must have been about 105 degrees. All in all, unless you are dying to stay at a water amusement park, the Westin is ridiculously overpriced, with almost no spirit of \"Aloha.\" Save your money and stay at the \"Aston Mahana,\" 1.5 miles north.

We had a less- than-perfect experience in Grand Cayman in 2004, and most likely would never have returned to a Westin, but we were participating in a wedding at the Westin Maui and decided to stay there. Hence, another disappointment -- with even extra expenses! Our room, in the older tower, was ridiculously small. My husband and I were bumping into each other all the time. There is no closet; the armoire which holds the TV set has a little side door with a double rack for hanging clothes, and two large drawers. The fridge just sits out in the room, with no enclosure whatsoever. I can learn to live with small coffees for breakfast and outlandish prices for juice, muffins and rolls, but the experience in the Salon/Spa was simply untenable. I decided to have an \"up\" do for the wedding, which was posted at $45 on the Westin Web site. After the stylist spent about 15 minutes creating a so-so style, she charged me $105. A miscommunication in the Spa led to an interruption mid-massage, which ended with the therapist leaving me lying on a table in a dark room for about 5-10 minutes. They would only refund up to 20%, or provide a repeat massage. I opted for a repeat massage, which was OK. Not great mind you, just OK (I had a better experience on the beach in the Dominican Republic in January -- for a whopping $35.) What's more, there is a $17 a day \"hotel charge\" that covers virtually nothing but parking. After spending a small fortune on the room, I believe this \"hotel charge\" to be extortion. The rooms were never cleaned early in the day -- quite often we would return at 3 pm, only to have to stand and wait outside the room for the cleaning to be finished. To the lost and found/security department's credit, they returned some jewelry (COD) I left behind right after I notified them, which indicates a level of honesty among the housekeeping staff that is admirable. My husband and I both got the impression that they were woefully understaffed for 100% occupancy. The location is wonderful, the pools are very inviting and the management staff seems somewhat concerned about guest comfort. But when one considers the very pricy tab for this hotel, there is no price/value equivalent. I would recommend an alternative -- there are many beautiful properties on Maui.

No sweat!\u201d", "Author": "fourcalls", "ReviewID": "UR3224878", "Content": "We just returned from the Westin Maui Resort. If you've made reservations, relax!!! I am a fan of this website and since making my reservations at the Westin last June, I have sweated this trip. When you spend this kind of money to stay at a hotel, you have certain expectations. From many of the reviews I'd read, I wasn't sure what to expect and wondered if I'd spent my vacation wishing, \"If I'd only changed my reservation to ...\" From the minute we arrived, we found not only the Westin staff, but Maui folks in general, have a very pleasant disposition (heck, what is there to complain about in Maui anyway?!) The bell hops greeted us warmly, we received leighs and were kindly assisted into our room. We had a third floor \"garden view\" room and found the view very pleasant. We did try for an upgrade, however the hotel was booked (mid-winter break for many of us mid-westerners!) It is always worth asking just the same, as I am often granted upgrades in most hotels if they have a room available! With a family of four, the standard room is small. Accept that fact right now, resign yourself to living out of your suitcase and getting a comfortable night's sleep and you will have a great time! For those of you on a budget (if there is such a thing in Maui), consider using your in-room frig to stock up at Costco and Walmart. On our first day we purchased, paper bowls, cereal, spoons and milk; bagels and peanut butter; apples and grapes = with the in-room coffee (Kona coffee is the best) we had BREAKFAST. We also purchased turkey lunch meat, paper plates, a loaf of King's Hawaiian bread (excellent), chips, cookies and \"beach snacks\" = with the fruit we purchased and some mayo and mustard packets from the breakfast bar downstairs, we had LUNCH. Mix this up with a few meals out and there you go! Not grand, but affordable! We used the two drawers in the TV armour to store our food and we were all set! A few other tips: WHALE WATCHING-- do NOT go out with Pacific Whale Foundation's captain \"ZEEK.\" Trust me on this one, you will watch (through your binoculars) the other boats head to the spouts and breaching whales while you troll or \"park\" in still water. However, our trip with them earlier in the week with captain Mike, was excellent. SNORKELING--if you snorkel around Black Rock in Ka'anapali, don't forget the north shore around the other side of the rock near the Westin Villas. While we saw many beautiful fish and felt very safe in the water in front of the Sheraton; however, we didn't see any turtles until we ventured around to the northern shore. Water is still relatively calm and safe. HANA--it can be a very long day depending on how many stops you make. A couple of suggestions. If you have the Maui Revealed book, there are several suggestions of places to visit where they tell you to ignore \"keep out\" or \"private\" signs. The islanders were very clear on this point: in many instances these lands are on private property and in other cases, these stops are on SACRED LAND. While you will probably visit unscathed, we respected the islander's request to leave that land alone and enjoy the many other PUBLIC spots available. We still saw more than we had time to thoroughly enjoy! Lastly, CAR RENTAL--if there are more than two of you and you plan to do the trip to Hana, you really need a four-door car. We had a two-door and after about the third stop, the seat flippin' thing really getting old! I have really gleaned a lot from this website, hope I can offer something here in return.

We researched and researched and researched for hotels in Maui in every location. We read all the reviews, looked for the deals, the same thing you are doing...spent some 20+ hours! The Westin had a good deal with Expedia, we were torn between the Sheraton and Westin for the Lahaina area. The Westin's pictures looked terrible on the websites except for the pool area so we were worried but the price was lower so we went for it. The Westin was gorgeous! The common areas are all outside and updated. There are five huge beautiful pools with slides and waterfalls that connect them all. There is a private adult area and we never had a problem with kids. There are two towers, one renovated and looking just like Westin's usual brand new contemporary look with the most amazing beds. The room was spotless and we were upgraded for free. The older tower was being renovated so that is where the only bad reviews are coming from. The rest of the hotel, including the service is exceptional. Everything was clean and everyone was nice! Shopping right next door with a very nice mall, Coach stores and places like that. We did a ton of traveling! Put 800 miles on our rented jeep in 8 days! Went to almost every beach and every nice hotel, we did EVERYTHING there was to do on the island and I mean it. Hiked 2 hours through jungle, bamboo, swam through rivers and climbed waterfalls to get to private 300 foot falls in the middle of nowhere. We got an awesome Maui adventure book that was worth every cent 10 times over, told us everything. Almost all of the hotels were older and just starting renovations. The sheraton was way dumpier in my mind, the rooms are nicer than the Westin's old rooms, but not the new ones. The rest of the hotel is plain and boring, nothing cool except black rock, which is on the beach and within 3 minutes of walking, open to everyone. Go to the Westin, book through Expedia if you can get deals like free upgrades and meal vouchers(the best thing we got, free breakfast buffet every morning at the nice restaurant, usually $30/person, everything in Hawaii is like that) Book through Starwood otherwise and become a Starwood member regardless, they give you free upgrades when you checkin. Rent a vehicle, go see the island, get a Jeep if you like to be adventurous and buy the 'Maui Adventure' book (the name is close). Do the road to Hana with the book and stop EVERYWHERE it tells you, it will be sooo worth it. Some people complain about the long trip and say don't do it, well we went back for another day to finish because there was sooo much to do, hardly anyone knows what is really there. Have fun, save money by eating at chain places, Outback or fast food, go to Walmart for snacks and liquor and go see the island, it is one of the most beautiful places on Earth.

We had always stayed at the Hyatt Regency, so this time we decided to give the Westin a shot. Bottom line: we'll stick with the Hyatt Regency on future trips. We arrived at 9 p.m. which I knew might be a problem, but we didn't have much choice because of airline schedules. Busy hotels tend to have only the dregs left if you arrive late. Sure enough, our reservation for a \"garden view\" room with a king sized bed was met with an offer of a parking lot view room (a.k.a. \"terrace\" room) with two double beds. When we objected that our reservation stipulated \"garden view\" and \"king sized bed,\" the front desk clerk told two bald-faced lies. First, she claimed that \"garden view\" and \"terrace\" are one and the same. The Westin web site disagrees. It clearly shows \"terrace\" and \"garden view\" as being in different parts of the buildings. Second, she claimed that the type of bed is not guaranteed. Again, the web site disagrees, stating only that \"special requests\" cannot be guaranteed. The type of bed is integral to the room type description on the web site, and in fact, rooms with king sized beds are sometimes quoted at a higher rate than rooms with two double beds. Realizing that we were not about to accept this nonsense, the clerk offered us a \"complimentary\" upgrade to an \"ocean view\" room with a king sized bed. So we accepted that, but when we went to the room we discovered why the clerk was so quick to offer us this room: a notice said we would not be able to use the balcony because the outside of that part of the hotel was being painted. We went back to the front desk, and said that there was no way we were staying for a week in a room in which we couldn't use the balcony because of paint fumes. Our next room was a \"mountain view\" room with two double beds, and a promise of a \"partial ocean view\" room with a king sized bed (and a usable balcony) the next day. We accepted that and got into what was a minor upgrade of what we reserved, albeit a day late. When we checked out, we discovered that the hotel expected us to pay $20 extra for that first night and $50 extra for the six subsequent nights because of the different room categories. The hotel also tried to charge $10 for the valet parking we had to use when we arrived because the self-park lot was full (we were told there would be no extra charge). I objected to all of these extra charges, and they were removed. When I asked why I had been charged for what we were told were \"complimentary upgrades,\" both the desk clerk and the duty manager said they had no idea. I can only assume that their back-office staff are told to ignore \"complimentary upgrade\" notations on the chance that customers will not notice. Certainly, the front desk didn't argue about removing the charges (the rate we were quoted was right in front of them on their monitor). To add to my irritation, there was no hint of apology from any of the staff. Their attitude seemed to be \"OK, you spotted it, we'll take the charges off.\" If you stay at this hotel, check your bill carefully, especially if you received services or upgrades which you were told were \"complimentary.\" Now for some other comments on the hotel. The $18 per day \"resort fee\" includes self parking, two bottles of water per day in your room refrigerator, use of the gym, and a few other small things (like a \"free\" portrait sitting and 4x6 print from an onsite photographer who, of course, will want you to purchase a $200 package). There is no reason to pay $10 extra (+tips) per day for valet parking, since both the valet lot and self park lot are literally 50 feet from the entrance to the hotel. If the self park lot is full, they will valet park your car for no extra charge (check your bill) except the valet's tip. The water is nice, but you have to ask for it. If you don't remind the maids to restock each day, they will not (even if it is obvious you have consumed the previous day's water). We didn't use any of the hotel's restaurants, because quite frankly, they have zero atmosphere. The OnO Bar and Grill is in the pool area, right beside the major foot traffic route from the lobby to the pool and beach. The noise from the waterfalls is deafening, you'll be sitting mere steps away from bins full of used pool towels by the pool activities hut, and the view in the other direction is people lounging around the pool in bathing suits--not a pretty sight, for the most part. The Tropica restaurant claims to have beach and sunset views. That might be the case, but it looks like a huge concrete patio which lacks any decoration or landscaping whatsoever. We ended up dining at the Hyatt Regency several times, and realized that the difference between the Hyatt and the Westin restaurants is the Hyatt isolates their dining spaces from the rest of the hotel, and also divides them up within, so you feel like you are in an intimate space, not sitting in the lobby or on the beach boardwalk. The Hyatt restaurants also maximize views. You'll be looking at lush foliage or the beach and the ocean, not service huts and foot traffic. The Hyatt restaurants are not cheap, but they are no more expensive than the Westin's restaurants. The same comments apply to the Hyatt's bars. The Westin's pool is rather ordinary. For some reason, they have outfitted their loungers with ivory colored cushions which all look stained. That's a really bad choice of color. The loungers look quite unattractive because of this. We took advantage of the Westin's \"stay at one, play at three\" service, whereby you can use the outdoor facilities at the nearby Sheraton Black Rock and the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort (a timeshare on north Ka'anapali beach--more about that later). The Sheraton's pool is much more interesting and the pool bar there is much better, with a great sunset view. The Westin's \"heavenly bed\" which they brag about so much is comfortable, although a bit over done. You don't need the duvet, especially because the air conditioning thermostat is on a motion sensor, which means as soon as you drop off to sleep it switches off regardless of the room temperature and thermostat setting. We found the room uncomfortably warm at night for most of our stay. The room and bathroom itself are typical for tropical hotels. The hotel figures you've come for the weather and the beaches, and there's lots of demand (if you don't rent the room, someone else will), so why bother spending money keeping the rooms up to a typical North American mainland standard? The bathroom fixtures look to be at least 15 years old (maybe older). The furniture is sparse. There is no wall closet, only a small freestanding unit that includes the TV and two deep drawers. At least we didn't see any bugs. Speaking of bugs, the hotel wanted to spray the inside of our room with insecticide while we were there. We wouldn't allow it. You really do have to be firm with the hotel management, or they will walk all over you in spite of the king's ransom you're paying them. Like a lot of other hotel chains, Westin is pushing timeshares. Every time we turned around in the lobby, someone was asking us to go to one of those \"presentations\" to learn about the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort. We realized that these are opportunities for sales people to try to hook us into making what most timeshare owners eventually realize (too late) is a huge financial blunder. However, the 7500 Starwood points they were offering us to play along, combined with the points we were earning during our week at the hotel, would be enough for several nights at hotels on a road trip we're planning in the Pacific Northwest this spring. So off we went at an appointed time. Our sales rep was a personable but rather inexperienced young woman who was obviously following a detailed sales script. She took us on a tour of one of the units (the resort is still under construction--only one of three buildings is complete). We then returned to the hotel where she took us to one of the \"closing\" rooms. This is where the hard sell takes place. After a bit of back and forth, she said she had to visit the ladies room, and returned with a sales manager. The sales manager placed his chair in the middle of the doorway (there is no escape), but when he realized that we were not about to spend up to $80,000 for a week per year (plus pay up to $2600 per year in maintenance fees for that week) he became quite rude. He said we were \"wasting\" our money staying at a hotel like the Westin. He strongly implied that we were, in fact, stupid for being \"renters\" rather than \"owners\" (even though as an \"owner,\" our annual maintenance fees would look a lot like the cost of being a \"renter\" for a week, not to mention paying as much as $80,000 up front for the privilege). He also claimed that Westin timeshares will be worth more in the future--which is not true for any timeshare on the planet (see below). At this point, our \"90 minute commitment\" had stretched into almost two hours, and I announced that the meeting was over. Fortunately, we did get a receipt for the 7500 points we were promised. By the way, if you go for the presentation and begin to feel like buying a timeshare (and it is a timeshare, in spite of the fact that Westin claims it is different), know this: when you buy a timeshare from a developer, on average 40% of the price goes to cover the developer's sales and marketing costs. This is consistent with the fact that resale of timeshares (by people who have realized what a mistake it was) is a buyers market, and most sellers will be lucky to get back 40% of what they paid. If you really want a timeshare, buy a resale.", "Date": "January 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cMaui-great:Westin-not\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3084624", "Content": "Our trip was Dec. 27-Jan 5. Quite crowded but Maui was wonderful. Lots of sight-seeing and beautiful scenery! Rent the convertible and do the road to Hana, discover the drive around the northern tip of the island, snorkel, book a Pacific Whale Foundation whale-watching trip, and check out the volcano! We travelled with 9 yr old twins and had a ball. The hotel however was mediocre at best. When we entered the Westin it looked very nice but looks can be deceiving. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and the room was old and run-down. The rug was dirty and full of stains. The room was small and there was no drawer or closet space. We were staying for ten days and had to leave all of our clothes in our suitcases. They remained on the scrungy rug for the entire trip. Not sure what the cleaning staff did in our room each day other than make the beds and most of the time leave us some towels. We did have to call and beg for towels on one or two occasions plus buy shampoo down in the sundry shop since none was replaced in our bathroom. Maybe because of the luggage problem, the rug, which was dirty to begin with, was never vacuumed and I noticed for four days in a row the same grains of sand on the bathroom floor. We wiped the floor ourselves with the bathroom towels. The last two nights the pipes in the bathroom were banging so hard from around 11:30 pm through 2:30 am that my husband went to the front desk to complain, but to no avail. We would've asked to move but because of the suitcase issue it would have been even more inconvenient than staying up half the night. One day I came out of the shower to find men hanging on a scaffold doing work outside our lanai. Needless to say I shut the curtains quickly! Luckily, we were hardly in our room but for the price, we expected it to be cleaned at least. If you want to hang by the pool you need to get up and save lounge chairs by 7:30 am. People put towels down to save the chairs and don't return all day, very frustrating if you just want to take a dip. The cushions on the chairs are absolutely disgusting, make sure you get enough towels so that you can put at least one over them before sitting there. The positive was the location!! Great beach, easy access to very good restaurants in Whaler's Village and at the surrounding Marriot and Hyatt. Don't waste your $ at the Tropica, mediocre food at best.

Since the company paid for the 4 days my experience was probably a bit different than the average tourist. Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor, I have to say that some of the points are valid and some of the negative critiques appear to have been written by those who are generally quick to find fault. Here are some of my observations: If you want to hear the sound of the waves and the wind through the trees from your balcony I would recommend staying in the beach tower. They have this lovely waterfall centered in the middle of the hotel, but the white noise totally obliterates the ambiance of the surf and the wind. What were they thinking? Our room was an ocean view, but looked out directly over the waterfall. Although my husband didn't mind it, it was a bit to harsh and loud for me. We requested a room change and were moved to the south end of the tower the next day which was a little better. There were a lot of children there, but it seems there are small chidren wherever you go. The only place you might see less of them might be at the Ritz in Kapalua? I don't know. There is an adult pool which is a bit more quiet. I personally didn't have a hard time finding a chair but it may not always be in the spot you want to be in. Don't be shy about asking an employee to help you search for one that looks like it's being held but not in use, as they have a policy to not let that happen. The rooms are small and at first glance it seems there is no storage to be had. Realize that there are 2 large drawers under the t.v., and closet (albiet small) space to the left of the armoire. There is a double bar in the closet and my husband used the lower bar and I used the top. You might want to call housekeeping for extra hangers. We used the drawers in the nightstand, and we also used the storage under the wet bar for our toiletries and smaller traveling bags. Our shoes went under the bed. Ultimately we were able to put everything out of sight. Room service, valet, and housekeeping were timely. Remember, in a big hotel you're going to have to wait longer than 15 minutes for something, but we never had to wait longer than 20 to 30. Remember that you're in the tropics and between the salt and the humidity things can get a bit corrosive although the only mold I saw was a bit under the soap holder in the shower. I was walking down the hallway on afternoon and saw the hotel maid wiping clean the wall and interior door trim as she was working her way out of the room...you can't ask for more than that. There is a Safeway and a Long's in Lahaina and we stocked up on soda's/snacks and put them in the mini-fridge. Finally, you have to remember that EVERYTHING in Hawaii is expensive. If you want more for your dollar go to Mexico. We were in Cancun this summer and although it was nice...It's not Hawaii. Whaler's Village next door has good shopping and a McDonald's if your so inclined. One almost needs a car to really sight -see although there are excursions from the hotel, and the whale watching (fabulous) boat picked us up on the beach next door in Whaler's Villlage. There is an excursion kiosk down by the towel hut on the property as well as in the lobby of the hotel. I walked around and looked at all the hotel resorts along the strip and honestly feel that if you are going to stay at a resort in Kaanipali that the Westin is a very good choice. FYI about the airport...remember it's not a major airport so checking in is very SLOW!

Only faults I could point out are a bit of aging facility (rooms), shows in the wear of the walls and carpet.

The pool was overcrowded with lounge chairs, yet one is asked to pay 5$ to take the same chair to the less crowded beach steps away. Our hotel room was never vacuumed once during our week long stay.

We did a lot of research since it was our first visit to Hawaii and selected the Westin. We usually prefer the smaller accomodations but figure how can you go wrong anywhere on Hawaii. We had a great stay at the Westin. The only thing we had to go thru was that they did not put us in a 'full' ocean front room when we first checked in. We paid for an ocean front room and they put us in a 'partial' (the building closest to the Whaler Village). The receptionist checked us in mentioned some thing in the affect of 'if the room is not what you expected, please let us know..' It was quite strange and I wondered if they tried to get away with it if people do not complain. We went back to the front desk and Taka found us a much better room on the 8th floor facing the ocean. Although it took him a little while to accomodate us, he did let us check out the room first and made sure we liked it bettern than the original room. The room we got was in the building facing the pool. The room was a little smaller than the origianl. But the wife preferred the full ocean front view. Beside this little incident, the rest of the stay was great. The room was clean. The heavenly bed and shower were wonderful. The food was good (we only ate in once and breakfast a few times). The staff were courteous. We had a very pleasant stay. One small note, the noise of the waterfall is a little loud even on the 8th floor. Although it was not something you can't get used to.

It was great! The place is elegant with an impressive walk through water garden... streams, plants, waterfalls (including a large waterfall you can walk behind), fish, etc... The food was delicious at the resturant \"Ono\"... which means delicious in Hawaiian. I'm a big breakfast person. The breakfast buffet was nothing short of incredible, having everything, lacking nothing. Even though it was crowded (Christmas week - yikes!), we were able to get an ocean view table every morning. I guess people don't realize they have the ocean view area. Shhh... don't tell 'em. The place was spotless! Everybody was friendly even though you could see they had their hands full. The valets were masterful at their job. My 9 year old son and his friends loved the pool and 130 foot water slide. After spending two weeks in Hawaii, we asked them what thier favorite thing was... it was the water slide. Hey, they're only nine. I noticed a gripe about lounge chairs in another review. There was a slight problem with the lounge chairs being \"saved\" by inconsiderate people. Simply point out the abuse when you see it. A Westin employee with gather the belongings and hold them somewhere safe for the offenders. BTW, \"saving\" lounge chairs is not unique to the Westin Maui... it happens EVERYWHERE... at least everywhere I've ever been. IMHO, another unfair gripe was concerning the time-share thing. They ask you exactly once if you want to view the time-share presentation. A polite \"no\" results in a free box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts and a Maui calendar. In fact, they don't even ask you directly. They leave a note in your room saying you can exchange the note for a free gift. So if you want to pass on the free stuff, you NEVER have to talk to them at all about time-share. Just about every major hotel chain is pitching time-share now-a-days. I found the Westin's approach to be extremely low key and I appreciate them for it. I thought the other reviewer's statement about the Westin's approach to selling time-share to be... well... ridiculous. This is an awesome hotel with all the amenities and services you'd expect in a fine hotel. And let's not forget location, location, location. The hotel is smack in the middle of the Ka'anapali strip and right next to Whaler's Village, a small mall of interesting shops which contains a nice whaling museum and some really great restaurants. They have a new spa, but we didn't use it. I kept saying I would get a message, but the days just flew by. Lastly, the \"stay at one, play at all\" program was very nice. You can go to the Black Rock Sheraton or the Weston Ocean Resort and use their facilities. We did some snorkeling over near Black Rock and it was nice to be able to order food, drinks, get towels, go swimming in the pools, etc... at the other hotel. The Westin Ocean resort also had a water slide, albeit shorter than the Westin Maui. The Ocean Resort was a little less crowded at the pool and I liked their pool side cafe. I'd say \"two thumbs up\" for the Westin Maui. The only negative I can offer would refer to the entire Island during the Christmas holidays. It's crowded. Expect long delays to eat at any reasonably priced restaurants. You need to eat early or else join the masses and wait. Also, the boat excursions we would have liked to take were booked.

So I had my hands full juggling the two extremes of age. We were all basically satisfied with the trip as a whole but we did have our set backs. THE HOTEL: First impression when driving up, maybe a little dated. First impression of the lobby, beautifull; waterfalls, swans and a \"mini\" lake. First impression of the employees, pleasant. Well thats the end of the first impressions. We asked for our two rooms to be connected, they failed to accomodate, we asked that our rooms not be facing over a parking lot and / or service area ie. trash cans etc. they again failed to accomodate. I instantly called down to be moved into connecting rooms with a partial ocean view. They responded \"those are requests, and we try to help with all guests with there requests, but unfortunately we cant help you today\". I told them I have had numerous & lengthy conversations with your front desk & emails over the last month, my uncle is handicapped and my aunt needs help moving him about, the connecting rooms, not an option its an absolute necessity! After 15 mintutes of complaining, (meeting a little resistence I might add), we were then given 2 rooms, connected, rooms # 554 & 556. Ours #556 with a great ocean view, however now we didnt have a closet. My aunt & uncles room # 554 remained the same floor plan, but had a view of the trash can storage area and the ocean...still a problem, but hey were on vacation whos wants to ruin it with complaining, right? Our room was appaerently the econo package, no closet, broken fridge, the connecting door hit the bar to smash your kids fingers (EVERYTIME THEY OPENED IT!!). I once again called down to complain, they said thats it for the next 3 days, then they might \"might?\" be able to help us. My wife my two sons and myself had a 18\" wide cubby hole they said was our closet, and I mean exactly 18\", and a 2 door dresser under the TV....that was not good, we couldnt unpack half the clothing. We never moved again thinking it was going to be more work than it was worth. Maintenance came up and removed the door, and replaced our fridge, well they simple put it on the floor next to the TV and plugged it in leaving the broken one. Pool very big, slide a lot of fun and surrounding area very nice, kids loved it. Bring float vests for your toddlers, the pool shop only has arm floaties. the bar/grill by the pool, expensive and surpsisingly small portions, $17 for 4 baby back ribs (1/8 of a rack or so), $23.00 for a piece of fish as big as my cell phone, it was so small my wife took its picture so we could laugh about it later!!!-get the burger and fries for $13.00 its the best value. Tropica is the main resteraunt of the Westin, still small portions but a great atmospere, they are closed sundays and mondays? That was 3 of the 7 days we were there, really stupid!!! So many people were walking in there to eat, and there wasnt even a sign saying closed. Some people sat in chairs wondering where the waiter was for 15 minutes plus, until I noticed them and told them. There are 5 or 6 concierge desks, all have a one track mind to sell you condos and time shares, so I was \"pitched\" at least 10 15 times to go to a 90 siminar, annoyed I refused every time, the rest of their service was questionable, such as very poor restraunt suggestions and where to go. The concierge sent me to the Iao Valley (may be misspelled) but failed to mention the road to get in there had been closed for several days and waisted about 4 hours of my day!!! They said ohhh sorry!! Do you dads know what its like to have a angry wife, yelling kids, and senior citizens that have to pee every 45 minutes, in a car in packed traffic on a detour with no signs.....I was %^$@##@%$#*&^*&!!!! ....to say the least! MAUI RESTERAUNTS: For fun go to Bubba Gumps for dinner -shrimp and drinks, although our waitress was very new and slow. It was a fun bar good service, excellent drinks! Suggestion-get ocean side table, modeled after the movie Forest Gump (Tom Hanks). Pleasant: Kimos, good food, atmosphere, ocean front view -get the ocean front table and not expensive, about $18 tp 25 per plate average, enjoyed the entire experience. For top notch but $$$$ food and service go to Ruth & Chris Steak house, no ocean view but the food, cream spinach, the steak even the mashed potatoes were noteworthy!!! $35 a plate average... the Hard Rock was like any other hard rock Ive been to, better for lunch or informal dining, a burger and beer kind of place. Cold Stone Creamery Ice Cream: Simple the best ice cream I have ever had, period!!!! The Hyatt Luau was like many other Luas Ive been too, although the one young lady that plays the princess, was gorgeous and I mean a 10! My wife said that, and I being the savvy husband pretended not to notice...I know that trap!!! WHERE NOT TO GO!!!!: Tomato Pie Italian food was horrible, I mean I got sick, bad! My 6 year old son god bless him asked the waitress what happened to her teeth? I looked up and she was missing several, my wife and I sunk in our chairs and asked for the bill, 1970 deco and frozen dinners being passed as dinner, or so it seemed! I didnt say it but I wanted my money back. Canoes: A horrible steak house with bad atmosphere, the cook should of retired 40 years ago, expect a for sale sign on it withen weeks! Canoes is where the concierge from the Westin suggested we go. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! My wife wants me to add that down town is the best shopping, park in the big lot, not those small ones that charge $10.00 the big lot is validated where ever you go. This is how we found Ruth & Chris, Kimos, Cold Stone Creamery and Bubba Gumps, by walking by them. IS THE WESTIN A GOOD HOTEL? YES, but like most vacations expect some set backs (thats me having a good sportsmen like attitude).

The rooms are a little small, but very clean and comfortable, however, the closets could be a little bigger! Who goes to Maui to spend time in the room anyway, so it wasn't an issue for us. The staff was very friendly and eager to answer any questions we had. The buffet breakfast is a little pricey, so if you're on a budget you might want to consider eating somewhere else. We loved our vacation in Maui and loved the Westin, we've already booked another vacation for next September!!!!! (It's a great month to go, after all the kids are back in school!!!) I think all the negative reviews I read about this hotel came from people who are just looking for something bad to say.

A good night sleep and shower can make up for other little things. We were there on a package deal and they tended to remind you of that fact. I didn't let them though - reminded them that I too am a customer and my satisfaction is guaranteed - that worked. It is a resort in a very busy area and at 100% occupency so when reviewing them, you have to keep that in mind. All and all, we were very satisfied. We had a room on the 8th floor on the mountain side. The view was fabulous! We could have done without the parking lot noise but it made for some good people watching. The rooms are small and bathrooms even smaller but the beds are comfortable and the shower is 'heavenly'. We are both short so didn't have a problem with the low shower heads but I could imagine a taller person being challenged. The lobby is great with the waterfalls - I enjoyed my $5 cappaccino on one morning. The ambiance made up for the overpriced coffee and the fact that it was a great cup of coffee. I didn't like the phone system. On many occasions I had to call a few times to get anyone on the other end. They are very busy all the time. The parking lot does fill up but valet is free when it is full. They housekeeping staff is great about delivering ice buckets, flutes and place settings - no charge just a tip. We enjoyed having a fridge to keep drinks and snacks to enjoy from the balcony. The food is very pricey for dinner but the ambience is nice. We didn't eat breakfast there except I bought a small container of $6 strawberries. Drinks were not that great and $8.50 each. I suggest having a little bar in the room (save your plastic cups!!) We really enjoyed the adult only pool during the day as the other pools were a bit noisy with the kids. But it is a pool! The pools were just great. I didn't much enjoy the waterslide as I tended to bang my heals around the bends - I heard many of the adults commenting on that but the kids didn't seem to have the same issue. I woudn't spend the money at the spa - it wasn't that over the top and was a very short massage for the time and money. And, there is a coed lounge to and from the massage - I am shy when I am naked, wearing just a robe. There is a great spa at 505 Front Street - Lei Spa - very basic but prices are good and massages are just awesome. The couples room is very fun and cool! We really enjoyed the 'stay at one, play it all' and use the Sheraton pool on one day and the free shuttle. We have stayed at the Sheraton and the Westin Ocean villas too. I would recommend them all! The Sheraton has the best beach for snorkeling and a lot more land space so you can move about - more resort feeling than hotel.

As a guest, you also have full reciprocity at the Sheraton Maui a short walk up Kaanapali Beach (both are Starwood resorts), and the Sheraton is also a great place for kids. The grounds at the Sheraton are beautiful, nicer than the Westin, and the snorkeling at black rock in front of the Sheraton is the best in this area. The beach scene at Kaanapali can feel a bit like Vegas with the restaurants and crowds, and I recommend Wailea if you want to get away from that. What we liked about the Westin was: the pool complex, our room in the beach tower was big enough for five people with a nice big bathroom, the fact that kids eat free at the poolside restaurant, the beach in front of the hotel, Whaler Village shopping next door, the beachwalk down to the Sheraton to the north and to the Hyatt to the south, the helpful service, particularly with all the activities available at Kaanapali and Lahaina. You can find excellent deals at the Westin because it is a big place and even with conventions it does not fill up during offpeak periods.

We loved it! At first it seemed very loud and busy after staying in Hana for 2 nights but we quickly found the quiet adult pool with a small but nice jacuzzi and bar near by. The other pools are fantastic too. The water slide is exciting and the swim thru grotto was beautiful. The water at first seemed cold but was always very clean. We had no trouble finding a chaise, were a little annoyed we couldn't use the beach cabanas without paying extra. The beach was great, a little undertow but very safe and warm with no rocks to hit when walking in. The room was small but very comfortable and clean. The showerheads are definitely too low unless you are less than 5 ft. The light was dim in the bathroom but nice when you had to get up in the middle of the night. We only ate at Tropica and found it to be delicious but overpriced. Don't be scared away by the music they play from 5 - 6(hard core rock) because at 7 a live musician comes to play and it sounds great. Leilanis was good, get the cashew chicken plate with veggies and rice. We loved shopping at Whalers and they have great free hula shows. For inexpensive but great food, go to Lahaina, 5 minute drive or 4 mile walk. There is a shuttle for a $1 from Whalers. Penne Pasta had great spaghetti, veal parmesan etc, nothing over $10. You pay 1st then they bring it to your table outside or in. No liquor at the outside tables though and no view. Alexanders near Mauii Tacos in Lahaina square has the best fish and chips we have ever had but if you eat there, you are eating at a cement table in a shopping center. Both places have great food but if you want the ambience, get it to go. We took one tour; the adventure boat to Lanai. A 5 hour tour with 2 native hawaiins aboard a pontoon boat with about 20 other people. It was great!!! The food was plentiful and delicious, we snorkeled at 2 spots, no turtles but we saw dolphins. Our guides were very knowledgeable and the trip back was very exciting with HUGE ocean swells. Don't go if you have back problems but go if you want to have a thrill.

Prior to making arrangements, I researched comments on this site and others. Here is an update / my impressions / clarification. First of all, the cost: Our deal for five nights for a 'normal' room came to $160 per night plus the $18. resort fee. This rate did not include any food extras such as breakfast. When we arrived we were told that we were upgraded to a higher floor (7th) with mountain view. The room was adequate and was on the small side, the bathroom was exceptionally small. The bed was very comfortable, perhaps not 'heavenly'. Westin goes to great lengths to overuse the word 'heavenly'. The shower was 'heavenly', the shampoo and conditioner were labeled 'heavenly. The 'make-up' of the room was not heavenly but was sporadic. One day at 10 AM the next day at 4 PM. Claiming environmental reasons, the Westin also imposes a mandatory 3 day use of the sheets/pillow cases; not the greatest idea considering the beach resort happenings [hot climate, sand, lotion etc.] and the room cost plus resort fee. On the third day these sheets have lost that 1st class feel. Some previous comments dinged the Westin regarding refrigerators & ice. We had a small fridge in our room (empty, not bar) so we could stock it with goods purchased elsewhere. Ice was free and available down the hall at a large ice machine. The hotel grounds, garden, pool were quite impressive, We did not have a problem with noise, kids etc. but then we were off-season for kids. Anything extra at the hotel; food, drinks trinkets etc. is extremely expensive. The easy walk-to access to the Whaler's Village was great because it provided alternative restaurants to the Westin that were comparable in quality/decor and less expensive. We ate at the Westin's Ono restaurant once; they have tried to make this a tapas style place and are still in the trying stage. We followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and went for breakfast to the Gazebo restaurant at the Napili Shores hotel.

The moment I stepped into the lobby I was awed by how big this resort was! The check in counter was small, but the staff were all very friendly and soon we were on our way up to the 11th floor. I must warn people that this hotel does charge a resort fee of $18.00 a day. You can see the full list of what you will be paying for on their website, but if you have a rent-a-car, this is good because the parking is included. An average hotel will charge you around $10 a day for parking so hey, it's worth it. Some other things you can get are free access to the gym and business center. The room was just what I expected of a Westin. Very contemporary and modern. I found out afterwards that this hotel went through a renovation. The carpet was so thick and fluffy that the door doesn't close behind you. The carpet held the door open. I guess that was the only hassle. The thing I look forward to when I stay in hotels are the amenities. Because I also like contemporary looks, I was looking forward to the Westin amenity set. I loved it! The containers the shampoo, etc. came in were simple and so stylish. The Heavenly shower was different. It's a double shower head, and the shower curtain rod had a circular arch that I liked as well. The Heavenly Bed was nice to see again. I already experienced this bed at the Westin Tokyo and was very comfortable. Here at the Westin Maui, there is a catalog where you can purchase the bed sheets and comforters the hotel uses, as well as the shower equipment, and even accessories for your pets. The prices are reasonable too. After getting settled in, we all went down to the bar to get some drinks. Average service, and nice view of the huge pool. It was like being in a water park. We never got to utilize the pool but I know I would have had fun on those slides! After the drinks, we went on a walking path of the hotel. We got to take pictures of flamingoes, ducks, parrots, koi (carps,) waterfalls, and a lot more!! Oh, when you enter the main entrance, turn right, pass the front desk, pass the Concierge, and turn right and you'll see some spooky Chinese soldiers awaiting you. :) Anyway, to keep it short, it is a great property with lots to do in the hotel, and once you're out of the hotel, Whaler's Village it there and you can do a lot of shopping and dining!", "Date": "October 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoboken, NJ", "Title": "\u201cPros and Cons 9/13-9/17\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2599453", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin for the first half of our honeymoon.

I did my homework on checking out all the reviews on the hotels/condos in Maui and took our chances. We simply, loved it! The Westin made our stay very comfortable...sure the room was small, but how long are you in it with the fantastic weather in Kaanapali? When we arrived, we did not like the 5th floor, we wanted up higher, the front desk was very accomodating and changed our room to the 10th floor - great view of the pools, ocean, etc. The staff was friendly, and helpful. You might want to get a refrigerator for the room. We needed it with our younger daughter. The one that is in there is too small and not cold enough. The hotel was quiet....you could hear the ocean and waterfalls at night...very relaxing. Restaurants are awesome...try out the Hula Grill, we ate there three times! Whalers Village was a great place to go shopping. We went to the luau at the Hyatt Regency....very nice. We did notice that there is not any beach at the Hyatt - the hotel itself looked really nice, but I like to walk on the beach at least and you couldn't do that there. The walkway along the beach in front of the hotels and condos was fantastic. The Westin helped us book our activities....pricey? yes, but you are in Hawaii don't forget! We tried the road to Hana....went 3/4 of the way and turned around. Because of the little rain they had, there wasn't much in the way of waterfalls. The views are very pretty but would not recommend it especially if you have small children. Our 3 1/2 year old got car sick on the way back because of all the turns! If you really want to go, leave early in the morning...it is a long trip! Also, do a catamaran cruise - we did the sunset cruise - absolutely beautiful. Drive to Makena beach and Waliea. You have got to see the water there. Stunning blue and aqua water! The beach at the Westin was ok, not fabulous. It was very clean, though...be careful of the rough water on certain days...the water down by the Sheraton at Black Rock was very clear....great for snorkeling. We took the Tropical Plantation tour. Very informative and pretty...worth going. Back to the hotel, we were very pleased and would stay there again...we parked our own car every day...easy to do; spaces are VERY tight but you get used to that. On our last day our flight was at 9:30 p.m. we asked the front desk what we could do since check out time was 12:00...they let us sign up and use the \"hospitality room\" later that day so we could swim all day and still shower before leaving for the airport - nice perk! All in all, the Westin was clean and the beds were \"heavenly\". The shower was great too. The lanai was quite small, new chairs are needed but again, how often do you use it? July was a great time to go - the weather was absolutely gorgeous....87 degrees with no humidity! The pools were tremendous....water slides were great for the kids...Kids 12 and under eat free...but do go and eat around Whalers Village - it is worth it.

My husband and two sons ages 12 and 14 and I had a fantastic time. I learned something from locals about the beachfront which I will pass on. We spent the 3rd week of April 2004 at the Westin. Prior to booking, I read many reviews here, some of which complained about the beach front being poor. Yet, it was great when we went. Locals told us that it is common that being an island, wind, currents, etc., literally change the beach year round. Some months, the beach at one hotel will be superb and other months much of the beach may have been swept away. In short, it is a constantly changing situation and that accounts for the inconsistant reviews regarding the beach. Our family of 4 was comfortable in our hotel room, but it was just a room with two double heavenly beds and an armoire. Our room had a mountain view of the pineapple fields - it was lovely and this was the \"cheep/undesireabale\" view. The grounds have been well described here already and they are fabulous. Service was tops. It's pricey, for example, a snow cone by the pool was $5.00. We liked being next door to the Whaler Village for browsing and film development. Laihaina town has a great Longs Drug Store and Safeway and many restaurants. Our sons learned to surf at \"Dukes\" and had a terrific time. Great instructor.

From the moment we arrived, the staff was great. Everyone was very helpful and accomodating, from the bell person at the front door to the attendants around the pools and along the beach. Our mountain view room was wonderful, with plenty of space, nice furnishings and decor, and some of the best hotel beds we have ever slept on. In addition to that, the hotel grounds are fantastic...acres of lush tropical plants and trees, fish ponds with koi, flamingoes, and swans, and many walking paths and waterfalls throughout the gardens.

As to the other reviewers for this hotel, yes the hotel and pool areas are crowded...what do you expect in Hawaii in the middle of the summer??? In regards to the parking, we had a rental car, and yes, if you come back to the hotel after about 9:00pm, the self-service parking lot is usually full. But if the lot is full the valets will park your car for no charge...all you have to do is ask. We took advantage of this and it was no problem at all. Finally, to those who always complain about the resort charge...I agree, I don't understand why the hotels issue this separate charge. Why don't they just raise the room rates by that amount, since you will end up paying the fee anyway? But more to the point, why do people always complain about it in the reviews? When you booked your room, you surely knew you would be hit with this charge...if you don't want to pay it, THEN DON'T STAY THERE!

Thanks to previous entries we stocked up at the Costco next to the airport - water, dried fruit, cereal, and VERY IMPORTANT, a beach umbrella. Great advice! We asked the hotel to empty the minibar fridge. After a stop at the local Safeway for milk and paper bowls, we were able to have a quick breakfast in our room. The Westin's breakfast buffet is good. It's $20 per adult. Our 8 year old ate free. But sometimes one doesn't want to do a big breakfast every day. The hotel staff was friendly and took care of our requests promptly. On check-in we had dirty linens on the bed but they rectified this pretty fast. The Ono Grill staff was good, too. Only one bartender up at the adult pool was grumpy. Our mountain view room had a pretty view but had no closet and only a small amount of armoire space - not enough for 3 people. But we did bring too many clothes for a beach resort holiday. We were surprised that the pool was empty every night. We love to swim at night. But the water was too cold and the pool area was very dark and uninviting. Oh well. Our biggest complaint about the Westin is the lack of poolside seating and shade. There are only a few palapa umbrellas and the seats there are \"reserved\" with towels and paperback books by 8 AM. And yes, many of these \"reserved spots\" do sit empty for hours. The hotel will rent you a movable umbrella on a tripod for $15 a day. A rip off!! They're useless on the beach because they are too flimsy for the wind. Buy a Costco umbrella instead. But this only works at the beach, not poolside. The other disappointing thing was the cost of the beach cabana chairs. These cost $50 a day even for guests and even if you only want them for a short time. Other hotels on the island do not gouge their guests this way. All in all, we liked the location and the beach there. But we will probably not return to the Westin. I feel that their real reason to exist there is to sell their timeshares ( I call them \"timescares\"). This is the driving force of the hotel.

Let me start by saying that we travel extensively and only stay in the nicest hotels and are very picky about our trips simply because we work hard to save money to travel and it is by far our favorite thing to do. With that being said, I don't think even my review can do this hotel justice. It is probably now my favorite place to stay ANYWHERE! In a nutshell, opulence is everywhere - lobby,grounds,rooms, pool, beach,etc. We spent our 2nd year wedding anniversary here and had booked a partial o.view. They upgraded us to a ocean view which overlooked the entire pool, beach, etc. - simply breathtaking! Everything is beyond perfect at the Westin: the concierge, the Amer.Express office, restraunts, gym, spa, and location,location,location. I'm not in the travel business but always like to check out other hotels if time to see if I'm staying at the best. I walked along the 3 mile beach and saw all the other high-end hotels, Hyatt,etc. and definately made the right pick. Even went up north to Ritz and Kapalua Bay to eat and even though they were beautiful, the location of Westin and perfect blend of activity vs. relaxation far exceeded these hotels. Westin has a phenomenal pool that can't be beat!! This is the perfect hotel for any age and families/couples alike. I use the word perfect rarely, but this hotel definately deserves it. I will not stay anywhere else in Lahaina on future trips!! However, if we return and decide to stay more South, we will stay at the Fairmont - heard and have read countless glowing reviews, including from my travel agent who is a Hawaii Vacation Specialist. When in Maui, I also recommend Mountain Riders (Bobby and Adam were great) for the volcano tour- do not go with anyone else. This company and tour will far exceed your expectations. The best tour ever - even beats the helicopter tours and road to Hana. However, Hana is great and you must do TEMPTATION TOURS, the only way to do Hana(www.----------------------). I have done many stylish and personalized chaffeured tours and this is one of the best, definately worth the money. (Randall was also a great tour guide). To wrap up, Maui is the place to be if looking for activity and paradise. Kauai is beyond beautiful but Maui has more activity/nightlife, but not too much like Oahu (too crowded/commercialized).

I actually had a closet. Carpet was a little dirty, and the sink area was only about 36in. wide, but overall a nice room. The parking lot was very cramped, but usually always found a spot. They graciously valet parked when the lot was full for free. We found the staff to be extremely nice and helpful. They told us about some local spots, that were cheaper to eat at. The beach tends to be very rough, and deep. It was very windy just about every day. Not good for swimming. The pool area was always crowded, but always could find 2 or 3 chairs together. People did let their chindren run wild in the pool area, mostly teenagers. They would jump off the rocks, or right over your head making sure they splashed you. I'm not blaming the hotel for that, I blame the parents. They need to put more hot tubs in. There is one in the adult only pool area, but since I had small children I wasn't able to use it. The other one is inside the main pool, and it is cold water. Pool water was a bit cloudy, and very chlorinated. It was tough to get a late check out even though we are guaranteed 4pm. We got a 2:00.

I was a little anxious after reading some of the reviews, but I think the worst reviews probably reflect bad luck and/or overly high expectations. You're staying at a huge hotel designed to part you from your cash, next to other hotels and establishments with similar objectives. Most of us are not staying in the Presidential Suite, and Kaanapali is not a remote corner of a sparsely populated island. So some imperfections and noise are to be expected. The pros: try to score breakfast buffet vouchers (but they don't just cough them up, see below), it is a very nice buffet with rotating dishes and friendly service; the bed is very nice, but it is the sheets and bedding that do the trick -- the mattress is about on par with an above average but not extraordinary mattress; the shower is not life-changing, but it is better than the standard one nozzle in a stall situation; the bellmen, pool waitresses, towel station, room service, and service desk operator were always very friendly and expressed concern to make sure the question or need was addressed (kudos especially to the pool staff for always keeping my pregnant wife supplied with fresh ice water on their own volition); the gentleman who seems to run the handing out of leis on arrival was a real prince, he gave us two leis on our last day at the hotel to wear to my wife's birthday party (and told my wife that I \"deserved something nice\" for asking for the flowers); room was cleaned nicely and at convenient times; noise level dropped off considerably by ten p.m.; ample drawer space; quiet refrigerator; plenty of towels and pillows supplied and delivered on request; very good lunch food on the pool menu -- get the vegetable flatbread; adult pool was a mellow scene; seemed to be just the right amount of pool chairs, with only the most prime (under umbrellas) chairs being snapped up by 8 a.m; Nathan the guy who runs the cabanas was very organized and set us up with a bucket of chilled Evian; the gym was super nice; the beach was pretty good, what can you do about the standard undertow, not the hotel's fault; the show with island dancing was fun to watch (saw that somebody had an issue with the drums ... we have young kids too, but we would not expect a mega-resort like the Westin to be very quiet and the show was usually around 5 in the afternoon) The cons: the front desk staff, except when things were very, very slow, was understaffed, rushed, and not very friendly (biggest example: we just asked about breakfast vouchers, explaining that somebody at the timeshare desk had said it wouldn't hurt to ask...we didn't pull any kind of \"so and so promised we would get them,\" we just asked: you would have thought we asked for the desk clerk's first-born, TiVo, and last scoop of ice cream and that we had sold her grandma shares in Worldcom... when we went back to pick up the vouchers, desk clerk no. 2 gave me the third degree about who had said we could have a voucher ... all while a big black binder titled \"Breakfast Coupon Log\" sat right in front of him. Definitely made the free $45 breakfast that much sweeter every day ... sheesh, sorry to cut into the 90% profit margin, Westin!); great location; bathroom lighting was pretty dim and flickering; the waterfalls are great when you arrive, less so if you are a light sleeper, but my light sleeping wife seemed to do ok (but we were on the 10th floor); the pay per view movies (just basic PG and R fare, thank you very much) were $16 -- yikes!; the elevators are very, very stuffy, it seems like there is literally no air flow in them, which can get a little old when you are coming from, say, the 10th floor; the concierge was misinformed about the dress code at Kapalua Bay Club: had we not checked, i might have shown up in long-sleeved shirt and tie and sent the geekmeter all the way to 10. In sum: if you want quiet and pampering, look elsewhere, but if you can deal with big hotel and can get a good deal, this was a pretty terrific place.", "Date": "June 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thousand Oaks, Ca", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointed!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2129156", "Content": "I was extremely disappointed in the service at the Westin.

We booked the Westin in a package which included a full breakfast and rental car. I thought the room was a very adequate size with 2 double \"heavenly\" beds. The armoire was a bit small with barely enough room to hang 4 or 5 garments but that was not a problem for us (2 adults..male and female) as most of our stuff remained folded in the 2 deep drawers in the armoire. Upon arrival, our lady bellman explained that valet parking would be provided \"gratis\" if we could not find a parking place. Most of the time we did use valet and upon checking out, we found that we had been charged twice for $10 each time. When we called the front desk to question the charge, it was removed immediately with apologies. All the people we came in contact with who were employed by the hotel were more than cordial and helpful. There were plenty of pool-side lounge chairs and the pools were wonderful and clean. I forgot to mention that we were upgraded to a full ocean view room when our hotel voucher stated \"garden view with partial ocean view upgrade\". Evidentally, there were no partial ocean view rooms available, so we lucked out. We loved the location...right next door to the Whaler shopping mall with beautiful, uncrowded beaches right there in front of us. Possibly due to the fact that most schools in the U.S. were still in session, there were not many children. The ones we did see were well behaved with parents in attendace. We would definitely stay at the Westin again and, yes, the beds are \"heavenly\".", "Date": "May 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "on vacation", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel/so-so service\u201d", "Author": "thaliajen", "ReviewID": "UR1925090", "Content": "As a seasoned traveler who had stayed briefly at this hotel before, I thought I knew what to expect. My hubby and I had stayed in February of 2004, but only for one night. (Origianlly we were at Embassey Suites and I wanted to find something nicer for our anniversery). I had stayed Superbowl Sunday by myself (hubby was at Football party at embassey Suites) and I came back raving about this hotel. I had booked us a suite at the Westin for the last night of our stay and we'd enjoyed it immensely. We were there during a high rate season so I had paid $330 or so for one room, and then upgraded to a suite for about $500 a night. It was the nicest suite I'd ever seen, with two bathrooms and of course, the Heavenly bed, etc. It had amazing views of the ocean and pool area during whale season and complimentary binoculours. So, when returning by myself for work last month (April, 2004) I was thrilled to book at the Westin Maui. Now, I did find out that the suite I was given for our anniversery normally goes for $2,500! I discovered that when, to my chagrin, after paying extra for an ocean view, my room turned out to be disappointing and the view was of the Whaler's Village trash cans! As a Gold Preferred Member, I do not feel I got good service, not do I feel that the hotel staff tried to offer that service. I did complain about the room and was told that it was considered a sea-view room, despite the trash. Not exactly happy, I asked how much it would be to upgrade to a suite. They claimed they had no single rooms on the side I wanted to be on- the one I had been on 2 months earlier. So, I paid an extra $200 a night for a smaller suite thatn I'd had the 1st trip, which took the sting out a little bit, but it STILL had the view of the trash! After realizing that I paid for this upgrade, and that there were other rooms available, I was pretty angry. The suite was really just a living room with a bedroom so small that the bed barely fit in it, and you had to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom. (Bathroom was very nice, BTW- the suites in Westin Maui offer a very nice bathroom amenity service, with excellent shampoo, conditioner, and other treats, as opposed to the Westin Mint type shampoo they normally offer.) Also, at thsi resort, as in many resorts in the area, you pay a $15/night charge. This gives you free parking (IF you don't forget and give your keys to the valet, because then it is about $15 more a night!) and a nice touch- they DO give you free internet access if you have a laptop. It is highspeed and doesn't cost a thing. (Well, it's included in the $15 resort charge). One evening I was out/about and in the lobby where a Platinum member was arriving with her husband, and they'd been guranteed a suite. Well, maybe I took the last one, but it wouldn't have mattered because the couple took one look at the view of the trash cans and left for the Four Seasons! The view can make all the difference for the trip- so be sure that you get an ocena view that is ALSO overlooking the pool area. Only the big suites get the pool AND ocean side balconies. And you DO want a balcony. Hawaiian trips are no place to skimp- the view is too amazing. If it costs a bit more for a blacony, pay for it. It's nice to rest out there and read, or watch the ocean or see the whales. As a Westin fan, I was shocked both times at the treatment we got from the hotel staff. They were never friendly, never seemed to care what I needed and even gave attitude at the simplest things like asking for extra pillows! Now, there were exceptions and of course, the lady who upgraded me on my february visit for our honeymoon, did an exceptional job. I didn't know until I paid to upgrade a 2nd time that the suite she gave us was worth 5 times what we paid! She was not friendly when she upgraded me and acted as if it was a problem, yet she gave us the best suite in the whole hotel! I have to recommend this hotel in Maui simply because of the pools, the beach and the beauty surrounding it. It is a perfect 10- the place I always thought Hawaiian hotels would be. From the waterfalls to the goldfish ponds, the landscaping was amazing, and the beds and showers were as always, heavenly. If you overlook the front desk staff (the room service guys are very nice) and remember to park your own car after dropping off your luggage (they charge $15 a night I think just for keeping your car in a stall marked \"valet\") and concentrate on the ambiance, you'll like this hotel. Having two different experiences, I still say that I would stay again, but I think the front desk staff needs a class in customer relations. I stayed a few nights at the Embassey Suites in February, and for the money you get more space but it just isn't a nice place in my opinion. The Westin has a lot of those Lahaina beaches beat, and I think they know it. That may be why they arean't as friendly. A big plus with the Westin Maui is being right by Whaler's village. You don't need a rental car to go shopping- just walk over there. They have a Mac Donalds and they have a Louis Vuitton store. VERY diverse! I would say that as a Starwood Gold Preferred Member, I think I deserved better treatment (even the line where the Starwood Preferred Guests are supposed to go is ignored) but the actual hotel is hard to beat. Great looking with an amazing beach area and spectacular views, plus its own water park- it is among my favorite hotels of all time. They had an adults only pool for us grown-ups without kids and I met a lot of people congregating there in the sun. It is raised so the best sun exposure is really up there and you can rent cabanas if you want out of the sun. (I don't quite get that part, LOL!) If you are a Starwood Member, be sure to walk through their Starwood Map area- it highlights all the properties all over the world and it's huge- you can walk through it. I know I wrote a 1st review when we went in February but I think this one is more detailed and after a 2nd stay, you really get a lot of experience. I hope everyone enjoys this hotel, and just ignore the bad attitudes if they surface. You really only deal with them on check-in and check-out, so why ruin the whole vacation on their attitudes? And maybe you'll get a good customer service rep- you never know!

We finished our vacation out at Wailea and had sun everyday, but I could clouds looming over Kaanapali. We returned to Kaanapali with our kids for the beaches, the Westin pools and because of the deal we received. 5 nights, car and $100 in hotel credit for $750.00. We thought how can we lose. It was a pleasant experience but not the low key island experience you look for. We have two kids 9 and 11 and the pool with slide and water falls was great. It seemed they overbooked the hotel, lots and lots of people and noise that never stopped. The pool side lounges were all reserved (people placing personal items or towels) by 8:00AM. leaving you to find a place on the grass or in some small corner of the pool area. The lounges would sit empty for hours with nobody around. Finally, on the second day I moved a single flip-flop from a vacant loung and used it for an hour before the irrate guest returned. This is a policy that the Westin needs to change to allow turn over in the pool area. Access to the beach is great with sandy bottoms and great views of neighboring islands. The hotel, food and services are really pricey. The hotel roof leaked during a rainstorm and the steamer for the hotel washer/dryers stopped working. SO, no pool towels for a full day.

But they do have the rounded shower rod making the shower curtain expand so you have more room to shower - which is a std. \"heavenly bath\" feature.

Next door at the Westin is Whalers Village with good medium priced restuarants and a McD's. So do yourself a favor and indulge in the Westin Maui.

I am glad we stayed in Maui first. The Westin is everything a resort should be. We stayed in an ocean view room and it was worth every penny. We faced the pool with all of the palm trees and beautiful landscaping - what a view. The room was a little small, but we were rarely in it. The beds are quite plush, too. The food is expensive, but Whaler's Village is just around the corner with restuarants and shops. We saw whales as we were laying out at the beach! The beach chairs are free, but are on a first come first serve basis and the adult pool has great lounge chairs and is so peaceful. The parking is free, but if there is no parking they will park it for you - just watch your bill because they will charge you $10. Tell them at check out that no parking was available and they will take it off your bill - no hassles. After Maui we headed to Waikiki for a conference. No comparrison - Waikiki is full of people - everywhere and at all times. The beaches are packed and we even had a private beach (Sheraton Surfrider).

I have to say that my wife and I absolutely loved it. We got a great deal on the room through Hotwire, and, as the hotel wasn't very crowded, they upgraded us to a 9th floor ocean view room - the view was spectacular. The rooms themselves are fairly standard, nothing particularly noteworthy; and at these prices anywhere else I would have expected a much bigger bathroom/tub and a much more handsomely appointed room. But we did stay at the Hyatt Regency for one night, and this room was very comparable (the Hyatt is slightly more upscale and refined/quite. The Westin is more of a fun resort).The resort itself is outstanding, with birds and fish, and is fairly opulent in its appointments. It's right on the beach and is right next door to Whaler's Village, which is a little shopping center. The restaurants are all overpriced, so we didn't eat at any of them. We went to Lahaina each night and had really great food at the various restaurants. The service at the Westin is outstanding, from the pool to the front desk to the lobby, and they all made us feel really welcomed.The Starwood program is pretty nice, and we ended up spending an afternoon at the Sheraton pool (the Westin has a couple of large waterfalls that make the pool area quite noisy - so we went to the Sheraton for more quite pool lounging time).We booked all our activities through third-party activity vendors, as the Westin activity center is fairly pricey. We had a truley marvelous time in Maui and at the Westin. On our next trip we may, however, stay at the Sheraton, as it seemed a little more downscale and quite. If you're looking for a fairly opulent Maui resort in Kaanapali, the Westin is probably right for you.", "Date": "January 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation...would go again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1614320", "Content": "My wife and I went to Maui with another couple in September 2003.

The rooms are on the small side, but you really do not spend much time in the room.

You can really tell the difference between high season and low season as our stay spanned both. The service was excellent and the Hotel was beautiful. The heavenly beds were nicer than other hotel beds. Our room was near the waterfalls and we found the sound to be more soothing than irritating. Our children loved the pool. Great hotel for kids, not so good for honeymooners. They have enough pool chairs for everyone, but do not enforce any kind of use-it-or-lose-it policy. People go down and reserve a group of chairs by placing a towel or personal item on them early in the morning and they remain unused for much of the day (high season, nobody did this the previous week). I sat for 2 hours on a group of 13 \"reserved\" chairs for 2 hours one morning and not one person came to claim them. Other reviewers have stated the hotel does not provide enough pool chairs. I'm here to tell you--there ARE enough chairs if people would only use them while they are at the pool. That is my only complaint, the hotel staff were great at I felt they catered to our every need.

Had an incredible ocean view room in the Ocean Tower. The room's size was fine, although it was lacking a closet. The beds are indeed heavenly...I have never slept so soundly before! Others have commented that the waterfalls below are noisy, but I actually found them, along with the ocean's crashing waves, to be quite soothing. We slept with the balcony doors open every night. There are 5 swimming pools, one which is an adult only pool, so if you want to be away from kids, this is the one to use. The hotel was under construction while we were there, so we only had one restaurant/bar to eat/drink at. Service was great and everyone was extremely friendly. The front desk people aren't rude, but they aren't very friendly either. However, the bellman are the best (ask for Christopher in the evenings!). They helped us get our bearings our very first night, gave us tips on where to go for dinner and drinks, shopping, etc. Extremely helpful. The hotel also has a hospitality room that can be used if you have a late night flight. Our only issue with this was the previous people left it a mess. However, the front desk was extremely apologetic and helpful with resolving this issue. The hotel is conveniently located next to Whaler's Village (Hula's is the place to eat/drink!). There is a beachfront walkway to walk amongst all the hotels. There is a shuttle that will take you to Lahaina that departs every hour from Whaler's Village. Very convenient.

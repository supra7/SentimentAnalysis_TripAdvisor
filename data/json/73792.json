Ive never seen two people try harder to please their customers. It was impressive. It was also disturbing to see people getting free food and drink and can not even leave a 1 dollar tip. Worst in room coffee Ive ever had. One cup brewing, and I was needing at 4am.

Was very impressed for the money. Extremely spacious room with two flat screen TV's and a separate sitting area. Kitchen is a wet bar with small fridge and microwave. No flatware. Great location close to freeways, airport and Biltmore mall. A car is a must though. Aside from the very nice room, huge perk was free breakfast cooked to order and even better, complimentary happy hour with wine, beer and well drinks from 530 to 730 pm. They are served along with a very light snack selection from their restaurant on the fifth floor with a knockout view of Phoenix and Camelback mountain. Almost worth the price just to take advantage of the view. A full menu is available at extra cost but not forced on you. Alas, two things prevent a five star rating from me. One is that in my room, the bathroom sink was located in the bedroom. There was no separation or privacy whatsoever from the sleeping area. That was fine when traveling alone but if with friends or a new romance, it would be awkward. Also, guests cannot control whether the heat or AC is on. Below 55 degrees, only heat is available. Above 70, only AC. In between nothing. As Phoenix temperatures vary WILDLY between day and night, this could be a real problem during shoulder season. I was there in April and wished for a little blast of heat in the morning even though it got into the 80's during the day. A plaque indicates space heaters are available at the front desk but that is not nearly as convenient. As these two items are part of the building structure they can't be changed so be prepared to accept them if you decide to stay here.

I normally stay at the Embassy Suites in that area, but this time it was full, even at my Diamond level. Therefore I had to switch hotels. All the hotels in the Biltmore area were full, there must have been a convention or many spring break travelers. This particular Embassy Suites on 24th street is very old and out dated. The interior design must be from the 70\u2019s and has not been updated since. The rooms were clean and the beds were not old, but the overall feel of the hotel and rooms were very old and uncomfortable. When I closed the door to my hotel room I could see light coming in from the outside. That in its self is not too bad as I have had this happen more than once, but the overall look and feel in the room was straight from the 70\u2019s and helped make my first impression worse. I arrived very late and did not have a chance to see if they had room service or if it was good, but the next morning I did try the breakfast buffet and found it to be adequate. The check in area was not updated either, it felt as if they had not remolded since opening day, and as I have already stated the whole hotel felt that same way. I went for my normal morning run and the location of this hotel is in a business section, which is not bad, but other hotels have more to offer in this regard. Like a lot of locations in Phoenix they are by the canal system and I found the running path along the canal, which is much nicer than running through a crime ridden area. Overall this was acceptable, but when I compare this hotel to that of the one on Camelback Road, the Camelback Road location wins hands down. The Camelback location is located in a fantastic area, by the mall with tons of restaurants, and they have a jogging path mapped out through neighborhoods making it feel like home. As far as I\u2019m concerned, if you are going to stay at an Embassy Suites in the Biltmore area the one on Camelback Road is by far much better than this one for about the same nightly rate.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunman, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFirst class customer service\u201d", "Author": "bigdog33", "ReviewID": "UR126939020", "Content": "MY wife and I and 4 other couples from our hometown area traveled to Phoenix to catch the men's NCAA basketball West regionals.

I got picked up at the airport by the free hotel shuttle which arrived within 10 minutes after I called the front desk. The shuttle driver gave the passengers a detailed explanation of all the services offered at the hotel during our ride there. Was able to check into my room early by 9.30 am and they offered me to enjoy their wonderful breakfast right after my arrival. My guest room was clean, well equipped, spacious, with a separate living room, two flat screen TVs and a small kitchen. Every morning the current edition of US Today was hanging outside my door for me to enjoy. The hotel building surrounds a centrally located pool area that is accessible until midnight. Free pool towels are provided, and there are plenty of reclining chairs and umbrellas to relax. The only small downside is that parts of the pool area are always in the shade due to the hotel building around it. The best part about the hotel is the generous breakfast which includes - among other things - cooked-to-order omelettes, sausage, bacon, fried potatos, coffee and tea, various fruit juices, joghurts, fresh fruit, various breads, muffins, bagels, etc. Everything is \"all you can eat\". The other great thing is the nightly 2-hour \"happy hour\" at the rooftop bar during which they serve snacks and unlimited free beer, wine and well drinks to all hotel guest. This event happens EVERY night, and needless to say it keeps the bar pretty crowded and entertaining. There is not much to do in the immediate neighborhood of the hotel, so if you don't have a car you will feel kind of trapped. But the hotel provides free shuttle rides anywhere within a 3-mile radius of the hotel (not just to the airport), so this is a much-appreciated service. Right across the street there is a Carl's Jr. fast food restaurant which provides cheap, highly delicious and definitely unhealthy food. The hotel has a small business center with free internet access and free printing of boarding passes. In the guest rooms you can get internet access via wifi or ethernet, but this service is charged extra and it is pretty slow. This aspect of my stay was the only thing which was sort of disappointing.

The room are 1970s style (painted brick walls) with a musty smell like it's been lived by a high school gym class. While the bed is comfortable and the suites large, they are also dark. The fans make more noise than a blender. The facility is simply run down. The positive aspect is the cheerful service with special note to the short order cook who does the mornign breakfast. To watch him is entertaining. To enjoy his fare is simply a pleasure. But the facility is in despirate need of a make over. And the internet is insufficient in coverage and speed to support business applications. And finally is a note on price. At the Hilton.com website, they listed the room for $199. It isn't worth half this much. But fortunately my company has a special rate that brough the price dow to one that reflects the real condition of this hotel.

The airline gave a few references for places close to the airport with shuttle service. I brought my bags out gate 8 and to the hotel van pick-up area. As I hit the island at 10:29 I called the hotel, explained the situation of travel problems,asked for a room and if the van was running the airport route. The front desk took my name and it's not easy so I have to spell it. Assurances were given that the van was on the route and would be there in 15-20 minutes. After waiting and seeing a couple of other hotel's shuttles make more than one circuit at I called again 11:06. The individual at the front desk said that he would contact the driver and tell him I was still waiting. In 10 minutes the van arrived. The driver was helpful by putting my luggage in the van. On the way he stated the van running times in the morning were on the half hour and with my gate and time that an hour and a half before flight would be fine. He also stated the van ride was about 8 minutes back to the airport. Based upon this information the deduction is that the driver didn't leave until after my second call. At the front desk Luis didn't find notes of my conversation and booking but would take care of me. Maybe the shift changes at 11? He had a double non-smoking room that will work. Only the room key in its folder was given to me and I went to the room to grab about 4 hours of sleep to return on the 4:30 am shuttle. The non-smoking room smelled like it was converted to non-smoking by using a can of air freshener. The stale smoke smell was very evident. If it was earlier then midnight then getting another room would have been attempted. In the morning I grabbed the bill from the floor and there was a second bill also slipped under my door; neither of the envelopes had a room number. I opened the wrong room first and saw that traveler's room rate was $84. Okay not too bad but better can be had for this slow summer season. Then I opened the second one with my room and name and saw $119. Distressed traveler pays $35 or extra 41% more. Shameful business practice from this hotel. I briefly complained when returning the wrong bill to Luis but this fell on deaf ears. This adventure leads me to advise against this hotel for travel. Also, I have been weighing Hilton Honors status when traveling but this experience will drop that influence on the decision, too.

As it turned out there was a lot of truth in those reviews but I would stay again based on my experience. Yes the hotel is old, but the management is very responsive to complaints. For instance my microwave oven broke down in the middle of making lunch so I called the front desk. Fifteen minutes later I had a brand new microwave. I was a little cold at night, presto, 10 minutes later I had a supplemental heater provided to me (they had already switched over to AC so no heat). The AC worked great on the warm days BTW. The only other problem I had was kiddie noise which usually ended by 11:00 PM. There were a lot of older folks at the Hotel here to watch various MLB Spring training games. They were wonderful and quiet. Now as to my room. It was spotless but dated. The rooms are a good size for anyone staying a week or two on business as I did. I only had a shower but that is fine for me. They are large. If you need a bathtub find another hotel. They have an excellent breakfast with made to order dishes such as omelettes, pancakes and French Toast. They let me fill my Big Gulp cup every morning with Diet Coke before my meeting and I loved them for that! The cooks were excellent and I do mean that. They can cook your omelette in about 3 1/2 minutes and I saw five going at once with no problems. The omelette stuffing choices were excellent too. They make a killer veggie omelette. At night (5:30 PM - 7:30 PM) they have an excellent free manager's appreciation open bar with tortilla chips, salsa, veggies and ranch dressing. They kept the bar full of snacks the entire two hours too. They pour generous well drinks, margaritas, and a few mixed drinks, as well as sodas. It's hard to beat free for these goodies but they do save you money if you are on a budget and who isn't these days? The meeting rooms were excellent. They were roomy and the temperature control was great. The neighborhood does not have a lot of nearby restaurants; however, there are two that are worth mentioning--El Napolito, authentic, inexpensive Mexican fare, and Jerry's an inexpensive diner.

To the staff, I'm sorry for this review, but Hilton would be well-served to take their great staff to another location more in line with their ES branding.

The minuses: the sofabed and living room that became our teen son's room were both very small as was the bathroom; there was only one cook making eggs, pancakes, potatoes, and french toast; the coffee maker was broken but got fixed just as my wife finished her breakfast; and the parking lot is small.

Mind you, I made a very polite request for him to call the kitchen and check on the boxes, so I was absolutely shocked when he said no. I had to get the shuttle to the airport with no breakfast and buy something at the airport. I should have stayed at Motel 6.

While they had paid upwards of $150/night, I had gotten the room for $50/night on priceline. This isn't a particularly romantic setting, so I wouldn't recommend it to lovers. But, the hotel is perfect if you want a place to hang out, sleep, and get free drinks from 530-730pm in the lounge. Some people were saying they made up for the overpriced hotel in free drinks!!

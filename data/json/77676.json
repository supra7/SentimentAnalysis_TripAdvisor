So we found the SeaBay and read the reviews on TripAdvisor, and finally decided to book there for a 4 nights stay. The hotel is conveniently located in OC, just a block from the beach. We checked in early and were surprised to have our room ready. By the way, the ladies at the front desk are just great. We got to our room and inspected as usual. The furniture was somewhat worned out, but OK. The carpet seemed humid, as if the A/C was not that efficient. We had a bayview balcony, which was very nice to have breakfast and afternoon time on. During the first night, we had trouble sleeping because of disturbing guests, but were so tired after our day of travelling that we did sleep anyway. The next day, I went to front desk to mention about these guests, and the lady told us with a convincing voice to call them whenever we were getting disturbed and that security would take care of the situation. I was very pleased by the answer, and even if we did not call the second night as noise was not too bad, someone went to warn the room beside ours to be more quiet, which we did appreciate. Overall, very great stay, in a greatly located hotel. The SeaBay cafe beside the hotel was a good place to eat breakfast and lunch. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Unfortunately, that was not the case at SB. The staff was nice and and accommodating, but the room was terrible. I am not sure if this is all rooms or just ours but there was an overpowering smell of cat pee right when you entered. It was quite humid, the floors were damp, and furniture all moist.

I booked this hotel for Sat May 12-Mon May 14 for our 1st yr anniversary. Upon arrival Seana gave us a cute little pale with champage and glasses. Real glasses, not plastic! There was a cute \"Happy Anniversary\" poster made for us as well. Ok, so we go to our room and it was perfect! The room was spotless and fresh. Our reservation was even upgraded. I booked a room with double beds but we were given a king sized bed with jacuzzi, for the first night. The jacuzzi was clean, our bathroom was clean and we were oh so happy to be there! For the second night we had a king sized bed with a pull-out sofa bed, and a private balcony. That room was newly renovated and seemed bigger than the first. In each bathroom were soaps, shampoo, conditioner and really nice make-up remover pads. The shower head/water pressure was thee best part of the hotel stay!!! WOW the shower was like love. I didn't want to get out. Ahh just thinking about it makes me want to book another trip now. LOL Seana and Jessica gave us a lot of tips about where to eat, what to see and do and their suggestions were dead on. We didnt have enough time for everything so we'll have to take another trip down very soon. The hotel is located right off the highway but not really close to the boardwalk. I didnt care as it was one block over from the beach, I had my guy with me so that was really all that mattered to me. The weather was great, I felt loved and it was a perfect weekend. I'd like to do this weekend over and over as ground hog's day : ) It was a little chilly this weekend so we didnt get in the pool but we did sit at the pool for a few minutes. The pool area was clean and the pool looked inviting. The other ladies at the front desk Aubrey, Shelley, and Jessica were great as well. Justin and I look forward to visiting next year for our anniversary.

The staff was pleasant and friendly also very helpful. After checking in they gave all the children a free shovel and pale set which they absolutely loved.

The room was well priced and if no issues had come up, I imagine we would have left there thinking it was a nice place. However, issues did come up and they were addressed poorl\\y. First, we booked through Travelocity, which said the hotel stay included a breakfast. When we walked over to the cafe for the breakfast, we were told by the front desk that Travelocity was wrong and that only people who book through the hotel's own website get the breakfast. I imagine the front desk is used to this unresolved ongoing issue, but we are not. We were treated as if we were stupid to even ask about getting free breakfast without paying for a room via the hotel's web site. I suggest the Sea Bay get this issue sorted out with Travelocity because it leads to misunderstandings. Second, the walls on our floor were paper thin. This was more of a problem for the people next to us, who I felt badly for, because we had a sick baby that would occasionally scream early in the morning. Since I could hear word for word conversations in the next room over, lord help those people who had to put up with crying at 6am. Third, I clogged the toilet. It happens - I did my best to resolve the issue myself, but without a plunger, it wasn't gonna happen. I called the front desk on Saturday afternoon to get it addressed, and by Sunday at checkout, no one had come. I used the elevator to go down and tell them about it on Sunday, but the elevator door got stuck on the ground floor and would only open enough for me to get an arm out. So I went back up to my floor (luckily the doors opened on other floors) and we simply told them at checkout, where they didn't seem at all interested or apologetic that no one came. On the plus side, the hotel is right across the street from a nice section of beach, we had a room in the back building that was overlooking the bay and my son got to watch a bunch of ducks feed and fight with each other, and the people staying there all seemed very nice. The pools looked like they were in good shape too but we didn't go in.

The view from the balconies is the same one they show on the website and it is very beautiful. (The main building views were of the parking lot or street.) The west building also has a small lobby/lounge area and its own pool seperate from the main building which was very cozy. Beds were comfortable and refrigerator large.

We stayed in the bay front building June 26-Jul. 1 in a double/double/sofa bed room. (Finding affordable hotel accommodations that sleep 5 is another challenge in OC.) The staff works hard and goes out of their way to make sure you are having a pleasant experience. The pools and common areas are cleaned every morning. The maids ask if you have any specific needs. I called the front desk because the floor above us was being loud and rowdy after midnight, and security was immediately sent to the room to quiet them down. This was the first time we stayed off of the boardwalk (saving $100 per night), and we had no problems with the location. The bay view was beautiful, many restaurants and shops are in walking distance, and my kids loved the fact that there were two (uncrowded) pools. Also, the parking lot had plenty of room so you did not have to worry about losing your \"perfect\" space if you drove somewhere. The beach was only a block away, and I will say that the traffic from the Rt. 90 bridge makes it a little tricky to cross the highway with kids, but not unbearably so. The building is not brand new, but they are not charging like it is the Hilton, so I was not expecting brand new facilities. Everything is clean and in working order, and that is what mattered to me.

This was setting me up for a great experience. This was maybe one of the cleanest yet affordable hotels I have stayed at hands down in a beach town. The room was spotless, the common areas were not sketchy at all, and it was nice to see them even cleaning the lobby during mid-day on a weekend. Our room was HUGE. We stayed in the east building, which didn't face the bayfront. I could have done without the children running up and down the hallway screaming day in and out but that's not the fault of the hotel - that's the ongoing fault of parents for never watching their children (a countrywide phenomenon lately). No matter where I go this is the norm, children like caged animals screaming. What's new. That's likely the only bad part of the whole stay. When the air conditioner was on, they were drowned out anyway. The shower had great water pressure, clean room, huge room, wonderful balcony, air conditioner was on upon entering the hotel, the air conditioner worked great, comfortable bed, etc. At night, their security guard is an off-duty state trooper. FANTASTIC to see. Especially since there is so much riff-raff that hangs around Ocean City (especially on the weekend we went, \"senior week\" filled with screaming drunk 17 year olds), they definitely keep it safe for everyone. Don't bother going out anywhere for breakfast when you can just go downstairs to the cafe. Great food, great service. It's tough to screw up eggs, and their bacon was crisp and delicious. Sure, \"General's Kitchen\" may have the best creamed chipped beef, but, when you want to just eat so you can go to the beach, why bother traveling? Everything you need is right here.

There was plenty of times I was woken up during the night thinking someone was knocking on our door only to realize they were knocking on the door 4 doors down from mine! we also weren't 100% thrilled with the location, it's bay side but you really have an obstructed view of the Bay.

The cafe was very nice, with good food and great, friendly service. The pool in the back of our building, Building B, is a little small,but has a beautiful view of the bay. It would have been nice if their was a hot tub, and an exercise room. They tell you about this gym very close by, but it is closed and the number is disconnected. Overall, the staff was very friendly, even in passing. However, upon checking out, one girl with dark hair and glasses was very rude and nasty. You could tell she was having a bad day. But we had a great stay at the sea bay, and you couldn't beat the price or the location. It is very close to the beach which is nice. There are a few overpriced buffets, but Dead Freddies was a favorite of ours. Mackey's has a great view and you can eat dinner steps away from the bay, the food was okay. The buffets, Hall's and a few other places just seemed overpriced. We ordered pizza from Johnnie's Pizza, and it was very good and reasonable. If you care to take a drive, you, can't beat the food or view from Hooper's. It is also a very safe clean city which was a nice and comforting surprise.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay, affordable price, terrific service!!!\u201d", "Author": "phenomenalkitty", "ReviewID": "UR77030622", "Content": "I usually don't write reviews of the hotels I stay in because most of the ones I stay in are nothing special, however I had a really positive experience with this hotel.

Now, an example of the great service at this hotel. I had the unfortunate experience of being in a room next to a bunch of obnoxious and noisy neighbors (screaming. . . and yelling. . . and cursing into the wee hours) and it was getting to the point where I was losing sleep and my trip was on the verge of being ruined. I decided to try and get my room changed and the front desk employee was sooo understanding (despite the fact that they were on the verge of being fully booked) and switched my room no questions asked. In fact they actually upgraded my room to a bayfront view and delivered the key straight personally to my room within 15 minutes of my original call!! A bad situation made good by the staff at Sea Bay!!! So, I definitely recommend this hotel if you are on a budget but still desire a clean comfortable room with good service by the staff.

After doing a lot of research, I determined that the Sea Bay was by far the best choice within our price range. And I was not disappointed. I stayed in the Kings Arms Motel in 2009 and paid about $40 less per night for that crap hole place. The Sea Bay is not perfect, but its a nice hotel and it met all of my expectations. When I made our reservations, I got a deal for a free breakfast for both myself and my boyfriend for each night that we stayed. The free breakfast actually turned out to be an $8 voucher per person for use in the new hotel cafe. I was impressed with the quality of the food at the cafe (the fresh fruit was actually fresh!) and while we went over our $8 vouchers both days, you can easily get a decent breakfast while staying within those limits. Another concern I had when booking was the actual quality of the rooms. I knew that the hotel had two buildings, and that we had booked in the slightly older building, building B. A lot of times hotels will only show photos of their nicer rooms, leading to disappointment when you realize that these are not the rooms you booked. But our room was just as nice as the rooms in the photos and the only complaint I can make is that it was slightly smaller than expected. The staff was very friendly, and there was always someone at the desk in case of any late night issues. I loved that there were two pools, although both were small, it was nice to have a choice. My only real complaint would be the quality of the sheets, they were definitely some of the rougher sheets I've encountered in a hotel.

Not a \"hello\" or \"can I help you?\"... just sat and stared at me as if I was going to destroy her day. She literally had to get up and help the boy on the phone with a reservation, sat back down, and still did not acknowledge me. Finally, the boy on the phone handed me a key. Even if she was not front desk (which is stretching it) she could have acknowledged my existence.

The only problem is really the location, you have to cross a busy road and walk two blocks to get to the beach, and it is a 15-20 minute bus ride to get to the boardwalk.

I read the reviews on here and decided to go for it. The price was a bit higher then I would have liked but still a good deal. It was located a few blocks from two big attractions; Seacrets and Fagers Island. You could easily walk to both. It was also a few blocks away from the grocery store and several other \"known\" places to eat. Another added bonus was that it is RIGHT off of Route 90, which is a nice benefit. The beach is 1 or 2 blocks from the hotel and was not crowded at all. It was an easy walk. There were PLENTY of parking spaces(often an issue in ocmd) and we got to park right next to the entrance to our building(the hotel has an A and a B building). We stayed in Building B, in a bayview king. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the room was quiet spacious. The AC and fridge both functioned properly. The view and balcony were great. The bed was also comfortable. I have a few minor grievances but those go along with any place and probably would not stop me from going back. 1-you can hear doors slamming of the rooms around, up and down from you. This didn't keep my boyfriend or I up but it was noticeable throughout the day and in the evening. 2-cleanliness of the bathroom. I did notice several long black hairs on the tub wall, bathroom wall and stuck to the hair dryer. This wasn't a super huge deal. I just washed them down the drain. 3-pool size. Nothing super spectacular but the fact they do have 2 pools helps a bit. Overall, I was happy with my stay at the Sea Bay. They knew Hurricane Bill was approaching(with warnings of rip currents and high tides) and posted information on the weather throughout the hotel. Each building has a separate checkout, which is helpful as well. I didn't catch the name of the man who checked us out on 8/23/09 in Building B around 10:00am but he was very pleasant and helpful.

Fortunately, my family and I didn't experience any of the problems that previous guests have encountered. Before you book your room, it does help to know the set-up of the hotel. The hotel is actually two separate buildings (A and B). Building A is the old Best Western and contains the main lobby and has an outdoor pool. Building B (where we stayed) is the old Sea Bay motel and also has a smaller, separate outdoor pool. I can't comment on the rooms in Building A, but the building is closer to a very busy main drag (Ocean Ave.) and the pool seemed to be much more crowded in Building A. Building B is on the Bay side and has a number of rooms which have a nice view of the Bay and the pool. Our room faced the parking lot, which wasn't a bad thing, but I know that a few of the families in our party upgraded their rooms to a Bay view when they checked in. I believe they were charged a few dollars more, but it is worth it. Each room in the building has a balcony and the balconies on the Bay side rooms are larger. I was pleasantly surprised when we first walked into the room. The room was very spacious and contained a sitting area, microwave and refrigerator. The microwave and refrigerator were brand new and spotless. The bathroom looked to have been recently renovated with a brand new sink, countertop and shower stall. A hairdryer, soaps and plenty of towels were also provided. The only downside to the room was that the beds were full beds. Queen sized beds would have been nice. The lobby of Building B has a nice sitting area where free coffee is provided in the morning. The lobby area leads to the pool which is smaller than the main pool in Building A, but is much less crowded. The pool area also has a great view of the Bay. The staff was very efficient and gracious when I asked for local restaurant recommendations and directions. One of our party actually had a problem with the air conditioner not working in their room. When they returned from lunch, the maintenance staff had pulled out the old A/C and replaced it with a brand new unit! I was impressed. Be aware that you have to cross Ocean Ave. to get to the beach. Ocean Ave. is actually a four lane road which has the feel of a highway. Walk south one block and cross at the light. If you don't, you'll be dodging cars like the old Frogger video game. Also, you will have to drive to the Boardwalk. The Boardwalk starts on 28th St. and goes South to 1st. St. Municipal parking is located on 1st. and is reasonably priced and usually has spaces available. A few restaurants to visit would be Phillips Seafood (the lunch menu is more reasonably priced) and a fun place to eat is On The Bay Crabhouse. We ate outdoors and got the \"all you can eat\" crab special. It gets messy, but it is a fun experience.

The only negative think I could see is that the decor inside the rooms (bedding, rugs, curtains) need some major updating. The hotel is easily walkable to Fagers Island, Mackys, and Seacrets. We did not eat at the restaurant and I thought the hotel staff was very friendly and knowledgable of the Ocean City area. I would not be hesitant to stay there again.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cDecent for the Price\u201d", "Author": "MarylandTraveler75", "ReviewID": "UR10064797", "Content": "We were in Building B, which is farther back from Coastal Highway.

The website said that all rooms included certain amenities. When we showed up there was NO: - Iron/Ironing Board -coffee maker -wetbar -hair dryer -or sofa I called the front desk after entering the room and told the person that there was no coffee maker in the room. The person said that that room was not supposed to have one and acted like I was making an unusual request to have one. An hour later i realized that we didn't have the iron or ironing board either. So i called again and the person said that our room wasn't supposed to have that either. I told the person about the website saying these COMMON Amenities would be here and he mumbled something about me staying in the second building. Like I was supposed to have known that already??? Only 1 of their building's comes with any amenities? The worst part is that one day the maids knocked twice when we were still sleeping and I told them to come back. They came back the second time, and i said we were still sleeping, and they insisted to replace our towels. So i got out of bed to do that. Then, 2 hours later it was 12pm, i called the front desk to request that the maids come to replace our sheets because we were ready now. The person seemed stumped that i would ask this. Hesitated on the phone and stumbled when saying they would send someone over to do this. No one ever came to our room to replace the sheets. Hated this hotel. Will never stay again!

The front desk was very friendly - the maids were NOT! Our first morning there, my boyfriend and I went out for breakfast and a walk. Around 11:45, we were going to start getting ready for the beach when the cleaning staff knocked on the door. We asked if we could have a half hour and the woman said, \"No, we're leaving in 10 minutes.\" They just did towels and trash. Getting a smile or a \"good morning\" out of them was like pulling teeth. The room was kind of small. There was no hotel guide with numbers in it, that you would normally find at a hotel.

It made the stay uncomfortble. The rooms need some work. The carpet didn't go all the way to the wall and it left furring strips exposed. The walls were marked up; I hope it wasn't dirt. The bathrooms are old and look it. The grout was mildewy, like it tends to get at the beach. One of the ceiling tiles was wet and I reported it to the front desk.

I don't like to complain, but there are some things that need to be complained about. As we entered our room there was an over-powering floral scent. I could not find an air freshener anywhere so the scent must have been coming out of the air conditioner. It was so over-powering that it made me ill. After a while you get used to it, but believe me when I say it's over powering! Another review that I read a while back said the same thing. To alleviate the problem I had to open the sliding glass door to the balcony. When I did that the flies starting to fly on in! On the up side, the room was a nice size and it had a mini fridge and a microwave. We had breakfast in their restaurant and although it was a bit pricey, it was good. On the down side, the room was in need of detail cleaning, especially in the bathroom. The hotel location is quite far from everything. It's 60 blocks to the board walk and you have to walk across Coastal Highway to access the beach. The lights are long. I'd say it's a good hotel for a quick over nighter, but if you're staying for a couple of days, stay in a hotel closer to the boardwalk. If you stay further up where we were on 60th St., I'd recommend staying in a hotel on the beach side of Coastal Highway.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Green TV, broken lights, bugs in bathroom., everything coming up from the huazu! My family and I got here the evening of our reserved night of stay. The moment we arrived there the staff at the front desk didn't greet us in any shape or form he, on the other hand, gave us a room previously picked by him without any of our say on it. We decided that it didn't really matter and that we might as well just bring our stuff up to our room -- can't do that! why you may ask, well because there was only one cart and was basically taken and never returned by a bunch of college students. We had to bring all our stuff up with no cart to come into our deluxe suite, or so our reservation said. As we headed in towards our room, the elevator was old, smelly, filled with stains and overall ready to break. We entered an smoking-room (we previuosly ordered a non-smoking room, so that didn't work out that well), which was overly-heated, filled with stains, had a broken light, no in-bath whirlpool (which was promised to us when we reserved our hotel on BookIt.com) and, yes, a television that was all green... hooray! We went in the bathroom later on and found a welcoming cockroach right on the sink inviting us in. Alright, the next morning we reported all our problems to the front desk and were told that they would get right on it. Surprise, surprise we came back later that evening with another cockroach in the bathroom, the broken lamp and the green tv. Also, the location isn't all that great... the hotel is, yes, 5 blocks from the french quarter, but the real french quarter is more around 15 blocks away.

This hotel is nothing flash but seemed like value for money, however 2 weeks later we are still paying for this hotel.

We peeled back the sheets and discovered a colony of bed bugs, most fully grown which means they have been there for at least 3 weeks and feasting on many people. We caught several of them in a cup and requested a room change at 3am which was granted to us. Our mistake was giving the bed bugs over to the desk clerk who promptly threw them out, (we found this out in the morning as the 'manager' claimed to have no knowledge of the event even though the desk clerk said he would notify him). They did refund our night's stay but when I politely told them to have it professionally treated (as the bed bugs were obviously established) he said his staff would take care of it. Do not trust this hotel for a bed-bug-free stay, as I have read in this review page that other people have also had the same experience. I know that bed bugs are a problem with many hotels, but it is extremely costly to get rid of them and has cost us money, time and heart ache as 2 weeks later we still have problems relating from this stay.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR120295887", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BIGTRIPUSA08"}, {"Content": "The Air Cond is horrible...... We reserved this hotel for the entire weekend and after one night decided to leave and book another hotel. We were booked into room 218 and it was like walking into a heat box. The beds are so close to the wall air cond. it just blew directly on the side of the bed. We gave it a chance to cool down and nothing. So after having the maintenance man to come take a look at it he finally decided all he could do was change out the cover so it would blow more upwards. We left and were gone about 4 hours and came back back to the same heatbox.We asked to please be moved to another room and were easily accomated to room 202. Ok to make a long story short this room was as bad as the first for coolness. The bed was away from the air cond. and it was still HOT. We had purchased food for the room refrig and after moving to this new room the new refrig DID'NT work. Surprise....! So my husband and brother walked back to the old room as we moved our luggage and also swapped the refrig. by themselves.

I was given room 520. Unbeknownst to me, this room was infested with bed bugs! I did find one dead bug the morning of my departure along with a small spot of blood on my pajamas and the sheet. The bites can take up to nine days to appear and since my stay was 10 days, my bites didn't appear until my trip home. I now have approximately 200 itchy red bites from head to toe - literally! I informed the hotel and they didn't seem concerned. I tried for three days to contact the manager. I finally reached him on the phone and he said they couldn't find any bugs so they are continuing to rent out the room!! I have never had any experience with bed bugs so I've done a lot of research on line since returning home the last few days. They are nocturnal so they are usually only seen at night and can be difficult to locate if they are behind the baseboards, etc. This would explain why they didn't find any bugs in the room.

Please note the high rating is from the great hospitality of the clerk on duty the 2nd night of our stay. And our room was very cozy, comfortable, and the wonderful hospitality of the clerk on duty Tuesday night Sept 11, 2007. Not a suite or what we had wanted to book, but still nice. We arrived in New Orleans at about 3 or 4a.m. We were very tired to say the least, had driven from Lake Charles from Baton Rouge airport where we spent the night at a terrible dive motel near the airport before going out to do some sightseeing the next day. Then decided todrive to New Orleans for a 2 night stay. I had tried to make the reservations online  then the telephone through an online booking agent, (Choice Priviledges membership club) but decided we wanted to see the location before we actually booked. We arrived very late and it was very hard to find, not knowing the area and Yahoo maps got us very lost. We finally found it  decided it was fine. The price and type of room I was quoted on the telephone with the agent ended up being different than what the night clerk told me it would be. I had asked for a King bed in a smoking room, and the agency told me that WAS available  the price, but the clerk at the hotel then said, 10 minutes later, that there was no King beds or smoking rooms available the price was more than I had been quoted by the agency, the clerk that night was not too friendly  when I told him I had just been quoted a different price  a King smoking room, he didn't seen to care  said all we have is a non smoking queen room. Found this hard to believe as the agency (Choice Priviledges, which Comfort Inn is a member) had just told me on the phone that what I was looking for wasno problem. But, as I said it was very late, we had been driving for several hours  my husband just wanted to get a room  go to sleep. The agency also had told me the parking was off sight, but it was free with a voucher or something from the hotel, but the clerk again disagreed  said the parking was $10 per day. The clerk was not very friendly as I said  wasn't going to budge on the price or the room type. I should have just called the agency back (Choice Priviledges) (a nice agency to sign up for by the way, you get a few perks from their free club membership)  booked the room they had just told me was available (for a cheaper price)  the clerk would have had to give it to me, but again, it was just too late  we were just too tired to keep arguing with this unfriendly clerk  not knowing where we were or how to find anything else, we took the room he said he had  my husband parked on the street rather than try to walk the 2 blocks to the lot they said they used for an extra $10 a day, not knowing the area once again,  not knowing if it was safe to walk that late at night in that area of downtown. The next day we found a ticket on our car, the New Orleans police are extremely petty when it comes to parking, the ticket stated that the car was over the line of where it was legal to park. I am not kidding when I say we looked  the car was maybe 1/2 inch over this so called line that no one in the world would have known about if they had never been there before. A local had to tell us what line they were talking about,  it turned out to be a very small peg on the curb side, impossible to see at night  no way to know of this rule as I said, if you've neverbeen there before. So, we got a parking ticket. My biggest complaint besides the clerk refusing to give me the agencyquoted price  room type, has to be the availability and crazy rules for parking. Its terrible. But, I suppose when you stay downtown, your going to run into parking problems. Okay, so we checked in, our room was nice, Queen bed, kind of small but we adjusted, a TV in a cabinet dresser type wood piece, night stands on each side of the bed, a desk with chair, small couch and coffee table, a small table with a coffee maker, a small refridge with a microwave on top of it, a small area to put a suitcase, a large window that overlooked part of the downtown area  an ironing board  iron all in the room. Also had wireless internet which was nice for us. All in all the room was nice, cozy,  all we needed. Thebathroom was the kind I like, with the sink and mirror, blow dryer, shower and large jaccuzi tub all in the same room. Wasn't expecting the jaccuzi tub so that was nice to see  looked forward to using it,maybe the next day, or so I thought. The 1st night was all about justdumping our luggage and getting some sleep, so anything with a bed would have been fine at that point. The next day we were able to see more of what we had for a room, and it was a bit small, but a nice room. We slept in pretty late, then took a cab rather than try to find parking to go sightsee in the french quarters and Bourbon St. We were a little disappointed with Bourbon St. We expected to find some Jazz or Blues bands at the many clubs along the street, but instead there was nothing but, pop, and rock bands playing. Was a bit surprised as that's what they are knownfor in New Orleans, the Jazz and Blues bands on Bourbon St and all around downtown. All the postcards have pictures of Jazz players and we fully expected to see one on our trip. But, there were none. We left pretty early after taking one on the ghost tours in the French Quarters. That was pretty interesting, but a long walk. There was also nowhere to eat at night, everything seemed to close at 9 or 10p.m. Another surprise, as Bourbon St. And the French Quarters are such big tourist attractions and the horse  buggy rides go until at least midnight, so was expecting to find something good to eat, I guess we should have looked a little earlier, but the area was so busy we just assumed we would have no problem finding a place after the Ghost tour, which ended at 10pm. We actually also never did find a place to eat the next day for lunch either, we drove around, until we became frustrated and finally just drove out of town to eat. We were a little disappointed to not have a good meal in New Orleans,maybe we just assumed they would have ample restaurants to choose from, or maybe we just couldn't find them because we didn't know where we going. We did eat at a nice place in Baton Rouge and also inLake Charles, but New Orleans we found nothing. My husband was dying for some gumbo, and wanted to try the Aligator, and of all places he found it and ordered it at the airport restaurant and it was very good.We arrived back at the hotel by taxi, which by the way is the better way to go, the parking would have cost more than the cab did. Thankfully the 2nd night at the Comfort Inn was a much better experience. The night clerk was extremely friendly, we talked for awhile about what we might do the next day as far as sight seeing and he was very friendly and had many suggestions and the lobby was very nice with literally hundreds of pamphlets of sightseeing ideas. And the night clerk was just a very nice, friendly guy, offering to book for us, and make the arrangements for anything we might want to do the next day. I had to go down stairs several times, as we had a non smoking room and floor, so I had to go down stairs to smoke. But,having a nice friendly person to talk to, almost made up for the inconvenience of not getting the smoking room we were supposed to have booked. I went back up to the room and was going to take a nice warm jaccuzi bath, filled the water up and was looking forward to a long soak, but was disappointed to find the juccuzi didn't work :( When I finished taking a plain bath, I again went downstairs and mentioned that our jaccuzi didn't turn on, and the security guard answered with, oh none of them work. Well, I think this is something the 1stnight clerk should have told me at check in. As it was I got a queen room, non smoking, for MORE money. But, the so polite, friendly nightclerk the 2nd night made up for my disappointments with the 1st nights clerk. It was really very refreshing how friendly most all thepeople in New Orleans were. Very polite, helpful, and just extremely friendly people there. Can't say the same for the police, or parking control people there. The 2nd day we found yet another parking ticketon our car, this time it stated we had parked in another so called illegal spot. Supposedly you can't pask within so many feet from a cross walk. This was ridiculous, we really weren't even near the cross walk at all, as far as we were concerned, and according to the laws in California, and how were we supposed to know this rule of howfar from it we were supposed to be? There was no posted signs tellinganyone this rule, so once again we got a parking ticket. I can't tell you how the breakfast was, we slept in both mornings, so we never did make it down to try the breakfast. So, all in all our stay at the Comfort Inn downtown New Orleans was nice. The disappointments, such as the not so friendly 1st night clerk, not getting the rate or room type we asked for  being charged a little more than we were supposed to be according to Choice Priviledges for a King room, was made up by the extremely friendly, helpful, 2nd night clerk, and the room did get was nice. I would recommend the Comfort Inn downtown New Orleans, but suggest you book it online or by phone with the Choice Priviledge membership site, or phone number, which you can apply for online as well, free of charge and start saving for future stays and get other benefits, such as late check out, which we did use, upgraded rooms when available, and a free stay after a couple paid stays at any of their hotels on their list. We now have a free stay on any trip we might take in the future. The only other thing I have to mention is if your not used to the climate in Louisiana, watch out. Its very, very uncomfortable. Hot, hot, hot, humid, humid, humid, skicky, sweaty heat that we weren't used to and didn't enjoy. It was really very uncomfortable. Even at night you sweat if you go for a walk outside. Loved the many sights all over Louisiana, we needed more time to see even half of what there is to offer, but what we did see was great. A complete opposite of the sights in California, so it was great. A great place to visit for a vacation. And worth mentioning, the peopleall over Louisiana, everywhere we went young, old, and inbetween, were so, so, friendly and polite. It was very nice to have such friendly people literally everywhere we went. Southern hospitality is really a true thing here. If you've never been, Louisiana is a great place to take a vacation, try to make a planner for the time your'e there, because there is so much to see and you want to try to see as much as possible. The swamptours to see the Aligators, but beware and take the right tour, some claim to be Aligator swamp tours, but you never see an Aligator, the ship casinos, lotsa fun, and I won some money so that made it really fun, the old plantations and mansions, the bayou, and even the areas where hurricane Katrina did its devatation. I'm here to tell you that2 years later our government should be ashamed of itself, they have yet to help the many, many people whose homes were detroyed. It was very sad to see. Ok, that's as poilitcal as I'll get, but had to mention it. There is still huge devastation in New Orleans and other areas as well. If you're going to take a trip to New Orleans, I would recommend The Comfort Inn  Suites, it was a god location to the French Quarters and Bourbon St, the Mississippi River, close to many sight seeing attractions such as the Plantations and old Mansions tours, Swamp tours, and much more. And the rooms are cozy, comfortable and quiet, and the people, excluding that one night clerk, are oh so friendly and helpful and make you feel right at home.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR668169517", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ready4agetaway"}, {"Content": "Great place to lay your head The property is as stated downtown so expect it to be a bit hard to find parking.

Of course, since this hotel is down town, there is very little parking near the entrance and the valet stand was unoccupied during our entire weekend stay. I don't mind walking to a parking garage, but the nearest garage was at the Hilton about 2.5 blocks away on some pretty dark streets between Canal and Poydras. The corridor of the lobby was filled with cigarette smoke from the hotel entrance to the adjacent bar.We were most disappointed with the quality of the room. First, the room was far from the standard Comfort Suites room we've become accustomed to. The room did not have a suite floor plan. There was no couch and the small refridgerator, which didn't cool well, sat on the floor by the door with the microwave directly on top of it. The television must have been 15 years old with a picture that could only be seen, but not clearly, in dim light. The bed covering was old with protruding threads and holes. The closet and vanity were exposed to the main living area with only the shower and toilet separated. The fixtures were old and some painted over. Fortunately, the room seemed clean and the non-English speaking housekeeper was very accommodating despite the language barrier.If you just need a place to lay your head that's convenient to downtown this location is alright.

The one review we could find written after Hurricane Katrina was quite positive, and the price was quite compelling. Unfortunately, the negative factors posted before Katrina (and supposedly before a post-Katrina renovation) are still true. We arrived 9 PM Sunday night and were immediately checked into the wrong room type. The desk clerk told us that none of the rooms of our type (queen, NS, jacuzzi) had been cleaned that day. The night security guard (the most knowledgable hotel employee we encountered during the entire stay) finally took his master keys and went into every vacant room on their list until we found a queen with jacuzzi that had been serviced. But, the jacuzzi did not work, and the toilet and bathroom cleanliness were iffy. (We cleaned the bathroom with our own Lysol rather than move again that night.) Next day, we moved to a more satisfactory room, but after doing so, found the jacuzzi wouldn't work in that room either, nor did it have a valuables safe, and it had frosted-glass windows, so we could not see outside. We wound up moving back to our original room, where at least we knew the bathroom was clean, having cleaned it ourselves. (Though, our feet turned black walking on the carpet!!) I went to front desk and CALMLY discussed this with the desk clerk. The hotel manager, as it turns out, was the guy in the shirt and tie walking by who ignored my very existence as I was trying to politely voice my complaints. The third day, we left at noon, returned after 6 PM, and found our room had not been serviced at all. I went downstairs and encountered the manager ... who wouldn't speak to me claiming that I was shouting at him, which I promise that I wasn't. When I went back up to my room - about 7:00 PM - there was a work crew changing out the hall carpet (which really did need changing... it was filthy as was our room carpeting ....) so we then endured hammering etc. till about 8:00 PM that night. I've since filed a complaint with Choice Hotels. I hate to write this review. I'm a New Orleans native, and I go back there not as a tourist but to work on my elderly mother's flooded home. The city desperately needs your tourism, and the Comfort Suites' location is simply superb for that.

That's another story....Hotel lobby was clean but somewhat worn. Hallways and elevators are in the same condition. Elevators are small and not airconditioned. The business center is a single computer in a non-airconditioned closet with a window to the hallway. It must have been around 100 degrees in it. Exercise room was part of a hallway off the lobby. One bike, one elliptical type machine, a universal type weight machine and a whirlpool that must double as a science experiment on the side.Room, clean but worn. Bed was ok. The mattress was comfortable but the pillows were both thin. Bathroom was very clean as were the towels. Because it was so long it had poor lighting at the desk. Airconditioning system took 24 hours to get the humidity out of the room but after that was fine. No wireless internet access for the first 2 days. I was on a business trip and had work to do!

There was a powerful bad odor covered up by sickly sweet air freshener, the lobby furniture had stains, and there were stains on the ceiling. It looked totally dingy. The manager then told us that he would not honor our US government issued tax exemption ID, claiming he did not have to accept it.

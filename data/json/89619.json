After placing three calls to the front desk to get someone to come to our room to see the issue we were told to use another outlet to heat the room. The power blew two more times. Finally after much discussion with the manager and maintenance engineer they decided to turn the heat on in the hotel. Many excuses were given to our problem. We were only offered a $50 credit off of our room for a 3 night stay. This was completely unacceptable to me. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Location is good for walking to the Boston Commons and restaurants. My room is a cubicle - and in speaking to my colleagues, their rooms are also tiny. So much so that it is a tight squeeze between the end of the bed and the wall to get to the desk and freestanding closet. There are no bathtubs in the bathrooms and there are no vanities at the sinks. The bathrooms have glass shelves above the toilets but they are shallow. The hotel has larger rooms with tubs and vanities but front desk clerk said they are few and provided to people with special needs - whatever that means. One of my colleagues is claustrophobic so she was allowed one of these rooms. The hotel bar is really cozy and has live entertainment but serves no food. The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only so during inclement weather you have to walk about 3 blocks to cafes or fast food - not a big deal unless it's freezing outside! I guess the main reason I don't like this property is the tiny room with terrible bath amenities. It's hard to be on the road a lot and I travel more than 50% of the time. The room is home away from home and this one was like a Japanese efficiency hostel. I was very disappointed. I am Gold with Marriott and expected better.

The room has a nice size - its not the newest one and in some corners really outdated, but clean and for my purpose just fine. The bed was good, the desk had enough room to study and work, and the free wi-fi connection was a plus. However, it is not secured, so sending very important and private information might not be a good idea unless you have to do so ;-) There is a small fridge in the room, where you can store some drinks and small foods. Coffee maker with normal and decaf coffee pads, and a vending and ice machine on each floor.... Only one negative - the air-conditioning/heat in the room is really old. When you turn it on and stay close to it (work desk right next to it), it will practically \"dry\" your skin .....

Having read the reviews of the hotel I was aprehensive about staying there but we used rewards points and figured it was just one night. The first thing that I noticed in the hotel is that the lobby is absolutely stunning. Lauren at the front desk was absolutely great and explained that the building was opened as an elks lodge in the twenties and had a long somewhat sorted history. I explained my concerns about the noise and roomsize and as a gold member she said she was able to put me in a room on the 12 floor towards the back of the building away from the noise. We did not hear anything aside from some loud older gentlemen coming back from the same concert but that is par for the course in downtown hotels. Also the cuecumber water in the lobby is a very nice touch. Coffee being available all day would be a nice touch. The room was small as I had read on here and was somewhat prepared for. It was more than adequet for the two of us for the evening. The rooms could use an update and a slightly larger bathroom. Would not want to stay in the room for a month but as a place to sleep it does its job. I guess that is the trade off for the hotels very good location. There are several theaters and nightclubs in the area so it felt like there was always something going on. There were lines of young people waiting to get into the night clubs and the valet told me it was \"just a typical saturday\". The concierge Ryan also did a very nice job. My husband forgot to print our tickets to the show and he was able to bring us to the front desk and print them for us. He also provided us with a list of restaurants close to the hotel but pointed us towards a small hole in the wall restaurant called the daily catch in the north end (see my review of them too), when we walked in we were a bit shocked that someone from a hotel would send us there as many other restaurants in the neighborhood look much nicer, but after trying their shrimp scampi i completely understood. After dinner we went to another recommended place for dessert called Mikes Pastry which again did not disappoint. Overall we had a much better experience at the hotel than we thought we were going to. It is true in a business like hotels the people really make or break you and the staff at the Boston Downtown Courtyard makes them from the bellman on the way in to the female security guard (whos name I can not remember) who helped us store our bags I do not think that we saw a single employee ther without a welcoming smile.

I went to bed around midnight on a Sunday night and some time after that, it sounded like a theater show had let out because a crowd of voices coming from outside woke me up. Then, I was woken up again later in the night when a bunch of people were walking down the street in front of the hotel and one girl was literally yelling down the street. I am a pretty light sleeper though. I didn't have any problems with noise on the next night. Also, sink faucets in my room were leaky, you had to crank them all the way around to get a sizable stream of water out and at certain points would let out an annoying high-pitched squeaky sound.

The guest rooms themselves are of a decent size, but furnished with the most basic and generic courtyard schemes, so once you're in the room, there's nothing to distinguish it from a room in Phoenix, Florida or anywhere else. The floor plan of our room set the bed close to the hallway door and the bathroom to the back, which isn't the best layout in terms of soundproofing; hence, we got a lot of hallway noise, and on the night we stayed there were quite a few partiers out and about. The lobby is gorgeous but I'd rather have a pokey lobby and gorgeous room than the other way around. Morning breakfast buffet is also cookie-cutter courtyard, a bit pricey for what you get but spot-on expected price range for a hotel breakfast. Don't get me wrong--- nothing really WRONG with this hotel, but I generally expect a bit more in terms of amenities or decor when a hotel is in a major city like Boston, and in the very high price range we paid. Location is great for theatre and clubbing, not so great if you'd like a quiet weekend away. The hotel's adjacent tapas restaurant turns into a weird sort of nightclub on the weekend, complete with the velvet rope, so if you're planning a return to the hotel during prime clubbing hours, be prepared to swim through the line of party-goers to get into the hotel. I would stay here again if the price were right--- sub-$200/night it's a great deal, but at our $300/night price point I didn't see the value.

I had the breakfast buffet once ($16) which was better than average quality for a hotel, but this is Boston so there's plenty of good places to eat. I am a longtime Marriott Rewards member, so i got a really nice room on the top (15th) floor. Stayed 3 nights. Room was quiet, large, and clean, with nice view of Back Bay.

Very good pubs & restaurants (e.g. Rock Bottom, PF Chang's, and some locals) are one block north on Stuart.

So, I asked him if he could call for us before we go online to see if there were any times open for us to book online (isn't that his job anyway?!) since he likely has a direct number for booking. So he picks up the phone and sure enough, \"they are wide open; just show up down there\". Great, glad you were so willing to help. Not.

On one occasion, I got charged onto my room account even after paying cash with gratuity for a breakfast. During our seven night stay, we were disturbed twice during the night by fire alarm actuations, which I am led to believe were caused by break-glass points being activated by late night revellers in one of the adjoining nightclubs. When this did happen, evacuation of the building was a bit too slow for my liking, especially as the fire department was already in attendence by the time that we hit the ground floor.

Part of the problem stems from the fact that this is a \"historic\" hotel (1925, I believe) that has been repurposed as a Courtyard. I understand that it's difficult to take an old building and effectively bring it up to modern standards. It can be done, of course, but it requires both money and ingenuity. There was too little of both invested here. The lobby is magnificent and promises an elegance the rest of the building doesn't deliver. The elevators are small and slow, and at least one of the cars made ominous noises every time we used it. The room was TINY. My traveling companion and I were constantly getting in each other's way as we attempted to navigate in the cramped quarters. There was no real dresser; just an armoire that played fast and loose with the laws of physics by being freakishly large on the outside and woefully small on the inside. There WAS a small, two drawer unit that doubled as a nightstand. The room did have a flat-screen TV (which was fortunate because there was NO place to put an old standard set ) that someone had scrawled \"No Good\" on the back of with a sharpie. I concurred with this evaluation. The maid service was questionable at best. We had to ask the front desk to send up shampoo and conditioner bottles, as Housekeeping evidently didn't view the presence of empty bottles in the trash can as a sign that we might NEED MORE. Towel replacement was equally spotty. I'm guessing that the linens buyer for this establishment thinks washcloths are terribly overrated, as we had to resort to using hand towels after the first morning. At least work environment in the room was up to Courtyard standards. Oh, wait . . . no it WASN'T. Small, cramped desk wedged in next to the gigantic armoire. It was actually one of those \"nesting\" desks that had a second work surface that could be pulled out to make more space. If it actually could have been pulled out. Which it COULDN'T, because it was too close to the bed. There was a LAN cable in case your ancient laptop isn't wireless, but the plug was broken. We didn't bother trying the hotel's free wireless -- Sprint MiFi: Don't leave home without it. At least two of the power outlets in the room didn't work. I'd like to say that the wonderful breakfast every morning made up for all this, but of course it didn't. We asked a simple question the first morning: Can you make an egg-white omelette? The answer was \"yes.\" This was a lie. It's quite the culinary achievement to create something that is simultaneously undercooked and burned, but our cook did so with aplomb. Twice. Thrice, actually, as we saw other patrons grimacing their way through similar meals. Fortunately, there is a Starbuck's just around the corner that served breakfast. The bright spot -- and there WAS one -- is that the Desk staff and the Bell Service were first rate. They were helpful, courteous, and prompt. The location was also great -- convenient to the convention center, and within easy walking distance of a number of superb restaurants.

Service and location were excellent! There were a few disadvantages, however, not enough to keep me from returning. Overall, a great hotel! My first impression was the service on the phone was top notch. They answered the phone relatively fast, offered personalized service and estimated the cab fares within a dollar for several destinations across town. The $12 breakfast buffet was nice and included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit, cereal, oatmeal and a few other items. The bars inside were attractive, dark and quiet. Good places to meet up for a night cap before heading up to the room. The second impression made was the location. After I was quickly checked in, I was shown a map of the surrounding attractions and offered a list of nearby restaurants and directions. The map showed the hotel to be in the theater district and within walking distance of Chinatown and the Arts district. Theaters are right next door and across the street with big name attractions. Chinatown is a block away with it's usual exotic attractions. The Arts district is a good 5 minute walk away, which is just past the park. The cab ride from the airport was about $32 ($7 of that is the tax charged for going through the tunnel), the cab ride to the Boston Convention Center was about $8. Cab rides can be a little shady with their fees and alternate routes. Be sure to discuss rates and routes with the driver first so he knows not to cheat you. I considered taking the subway, but wasn't able to risk running late to my meetings. There were a few issues that kept this hotel from being perfect, but not even close to being enough to keep me from returning. Scaffolding was set up in front of the facade of the hotel for some type of remodeling, but it wasn't in the way of walking along the sidewalk. I did have difficulty receiving a signal in some parts of the lobby, but that may be an issue with my carrier. This hotel does not have a pool, but there is a YMCA nearby. Although there is a 24 hr exercise room, it is limited to treadmills and the like. There were no free weights and the room was not very large. As with most historic hotels, this room was not considered large, however, it contained a queen size bed, two bedside tables, a desk and flat screen tv. The tv was mounted on the wall with a magazine rack below only sticking out about two inches from the wall. For some reason, my tv did not show a picture. I only turned it on for background noise while ironing my shirt, so it didn't disappoint me.

I've stayed in hotels in nearly every major city in the US (NY, Boston, Chicago, and LA) and the rooms in this hotel were still postage stamp sized by comparison. You'd need to go to Europe (or a cruise ship) to find a comparably sized room and even then rarely have I encountered a room so small anywhere in the world. Some rooms don't even have closets and I couldn't figure out how to sit in the office chair (the only place to sit besides the bed) without blocking the exit to the room. The bathroom in particular was so small that it could only fit a stand-up shower and I literally needed to straddle the toilet in order to close the door.

The \"nightclub\" issues that other reviewers mentioned are accurate as well. The block where the hotel is located is shared with several clubs blasting \"booming\" music with patrons attired in skirts so short they needed to hold them down in order to walk. Rather than a random event, seeing stumbling drunk girls dressed like prostitutes was a regular sight in front of the hotel. Beyond the noise issue, I also noticed an abundance of cheap liquor bottles (and broken glass) strewn about the area which I observed was the result of club patrons trying to \"chug\" down booze before entering the club and leaving what they couldn't finish for homeless people to collect when they weren't chatting with the bellmen or pan-handling in front of the hotel.

The rooms were next to each other, and were both standard rooms, however they were different. We had an armoire for a closet, and our friends had a bigger closet built as part of the room. We had a flat screen tv with very poor reception, and their tv didn't even work, ironically one of the friends we were with works for a cable company. They had a small refridgerator and we didn't. Plus, the rooms were small. If you've ever been on a cruise ship, these rooms might be a little bigger but not much, the bathrooms are a little bigger but not the bedrooms. While in the bathroom I was noticing that the grout between the tiles was much darker where people walked, and was very light behind the door. Overall the room seemed relatively clean.

Apart from this little hitch the hotel was fine, clean and served its purpose. On the whole the staff were friendly and helpful especially the house keeping staff. The area surrounding hotel is a little rundown but it is down town. So to be expected but it is a great location for getting out and about. Only had breakfast once during stay but that was more to do with trying to control food intake because of the size of meals served every where. The break fast was good with a good selection. Piano bar was naff and badly in need of an update.

The hotel itself is obviously an older building and that, by definition, limits some stuff.

The internet (free wired) worked perfectly and, certainly for me, was not dial-up speed but was fine. The bathroom and other facilities were all of a Courtyard standard.

He denies that there was a function on the fifth floor which I knew was a lie. The noise continued so I decided to go down to the fifth floor to see what on earth was going on.

They got angry that I had gone onto the fith floor to find out what was going on.

The King room was very small - the smallest room I have ever seen in a Marriott, Courtyard, Hilton or Holiday Inn - and that includes stays in New York and Europe, where rooms are notoriously small! It also had no bath, just a shower. The twin room we had was bigger with enough room for a city centre hotel as well as having a bath. The problem we had with our twin room was with the heating - and with Boston's weather even in March that is not what you want! The heating had an old fashioned controller which was clearly not thermostatic, and a 2 speed fan. At high speed the noise it made was unbearably loud, and after a while the fan started making squeaking and grinding sounds - so no sleep with that! And on slow speed it did not provide enough heat and the room got colder and colder. And unlike other Marriotts there were no additional blankets or other bedding in the room. So we had to get up during the night to switch the fan onto high speed then low speed a couple of times - not a very restful night! This seemed to be a problem only with our room and I suspect that the heating was simply not up to its increased size and corner location with 3 windows. Another problem was that we all agreed that the beds were not very comfortable - a complaint I have never had to make before with any Courtyard or Marriot. In fact my daughter normally chooses Marriott because of the great beds. And finally they were very mean with the toiletries and accessories - no safe, shower cap, or bath salts. for example The good bit is that the hotel is well located in a nice city.

We arrived at the hotel around 9:30am and was offered a room on the 6th floor which we declined after reading some of the reviews here that suggest requesting a room on a higher floor. The hotel does have a luggage room and we stored our bags there until we came back for check in around 4:00pm. At this time, we were given a room on the 9th floor (Rm 934). Our room had a king bed which occupied most of the room. It was enough space for the two of us and our luggage. Room was clean for the most part...I did notice some dust on the bedside table, alarm clock and desk. Plus the wrapper on one of the glasses looked like it had been taken off, crumpled and put back on the glass. Bed and bedding was extremely comfortable and we slept soundly. The bathroom was tiny and did not have a tub nor a fan so prepare yourselves for a steamy shower. And the television, which in hotels is traditionally placed infront of the bed was located way off to the side. A giant circular mirror faces the bed in its place. I think the location of this hotel definitely its strong point. It is super easy to reach from Logan Airport via the T. You can basically see the hotel as you come out of the NE Medical Centre T-stop - Orange Line (remember to exit Tremont Street) and it is a 3 min. walk to the Boylston stop on the Green Line. And there is so much to see and do within walking distance. However, the hotel is not in a very quiet area, so if you are a light sleeper or from the suburbs and not accustomed to city noise, this may not be the hotel for you. Also, if you don't like youths, you maybe offended by the masses of college students in line on a Saturday night for the Roxy night club which is on the ground floor of the hotel. The bassy club sounds filled the lobby and were heard on the 9th floor. Sunday night, it's an older crowd in line but the music is more subdued and not quite as loud. A solution to these weekend sounds? A couple of pints or a glass of wine at the nearby Rock Bottom Brewery should do the trick! Monday morning at 7:30am, construction noises began at the W Hotel/Condo building next door. Rise and shine for a delightful breakfast at Flour Cafe and Bakery. Not to mention that the walls in this hotel are paper thin. We had a mom and two teenage daughters staying next door to us and they were speaking at slightly louder than indoor volume levels and we could hear every word they were saying to the point it felt like they were right in the room with us. So consider this as a warning to honeymooners and people who are loud speakers...your neighbours will hear everything! We were thrilled to learn that this hotel was a non-smoking property but we're disappointed when got off the elevator on the 9th floor and were greeted with a waft of cigarette smoke that also filled our room. Clearly not all guests abided by the non-smoking rule. The staff at the hotel were friendly and accomodating.

In hindsight we were happy with our choice and would stay at that hotel again and would recommend it to friends. The hotel was nice - a standard Marriott with decent sized clean rooms, nice decor and comfortable beds. We were a bit disappointed that we could hear conversations in the next bedroom word perfect through the seemingly paper-thin adjoining (but locked) door, but we were too exhausted from travelling to ask to change rooms, and in the end too tired to be kept awake by any noise. The other couple travelling with us did not have an adjoining room and did not have a problem. And I'm sure that the hotel would have moved us had we complained. Breakfast at the hotel was nice with a decent enough selection - nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either. The hotel bar was a bit dismal, dark and expensive though, and reminded me of seedy looking comedy clubs that you see on tv - not in a good way - we opted to take our drinks to our rooms. The location of the hotel made it perfect for us. It was easy to get to from the airport (take the airport shuttle to the blue Metro line then change once onto the orange line) with the entrance to the Metro station just across the road from the hotel. And it was a few minutes stroll away from the start of the Freedom Trail which was one of the main things we wanted to do while visiting the city, and a few minutes more to Fanueil Market and the waterfront. It's also near a Metro station for the green line which made travel to the Skywalk Prudential Building quick and easy. I recommend lunch at the restaurant at the top of the Prudential Building, the cocktails are lovely (and strong). And our whale watching trip was the highlight or our whole holiday. Both Cheers bars (there are two) are worth a glance but the Beacon venue is much better to the touristy Fanueil Market location.

When we arrived we asked for a room as high as possible, and a corner room if possible (as suggested on this site). They laughed and said they heard that all the time, and gave us a room on the 9th floor that wasn't a corner unit, but was one of their biggest rooms (921). Unfortunately, it was a King bed rather than the double beds we wanted, but they were all out of those rooms. The room itself was HUGE. Biggest hotel bathroom I've ever seen, and plenty of space. Not a lot of drawers (only a side table with two tiny drawers and one armoire), which was a pain. The bed was very comfortable, and their were many pillows of varying sizes to choose from. Most complaints on this site seem to be about the noise. We were there from a Thursday to a Tuesday, and the only night that we heard a lot of noise from the street was Saturday, and it was pretty faint. However, we were directly across from the elevator, people were very loud in the halls (lack of sound insulation?), we could hear everything the people next door were saying, and the fire alarm and mini fridge both made weird, irritating noises. So yes, noise is an issue at this hotel. We're pretty laid back about that kind of stuff though, so it didn't bother us too much, and it certainly didn't prevent us from sleeping at night. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's about a three minute walk away from at least two subway stops. Boylston on the Green line was the closest. There were plenty of restaurants, and being next to the Common was fantastic. Not too far away from the airport or the Bus station either. Free internet in the lobby was also a big plus, although we only discovered it on our last day since it was tucked away in the corner. My only real complaint about this hotel was that the bellhop flagged down the hotel's town car as we were leaving before we could hail a taxi and told us the car would charge the same amount. Our fault for not confirming with the driver, sure, but she charged us $30 to get to the airport, when it only would've been $25 by taxi at the most. (it's $25 to get to the hotel, including a $7.50 fee for leaving the airport. Tolls to get into the airport are only $2.50 so the ride should actually have been only $20 in a taxi).

Hotel is in a great location within the Theatre District and is only a short walk to Boston Common and the shopping area on Washington Street. Newbury Street shops is probably about a 20 minute walk away. The hotel is a bit dated, but they have made attempts to try and modernise the rooms albeit utlilising a strange choice of colours. As I was travelling with my two brothers, we requested a larger room, which was accomodated in order to get a rollaway bed in the room. We had one of the end rooms on the 6th floor which was massive. The only downside for having an end room is that it overlooked the nightclub which is down one of the side streets from the hotel. As it was a weekend, I was quite often woken in the early hours of the morning with shouting outside the club. Other than the disturbance, the hotel is still worth staying at for what was an affordable price. The area around the hotel is a bit shabby, but since my last visit they seem to be doing some building work, which hopefully might make the area a bit more attractive. If you do stay here, try Rock Bottom on Stuart Street for great Food and Beer, which is brewed on site. Also, you are not far from Legal Seafood which is probably one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever visited.

The location is horrible unless you are going to the theaters - in an up-and-coming area that isn't quite there yet, with hit-and-miss blocks (some feeling rather deserted and sketchy). I didn't have any problem with noise, but it was a Tuesday night and they put me on the top floor facing away from the street. Check-in was pretty good. The lobby is very pretty - the hotel clearly has some historical legacy - but had a musty natural gas smell. The room was garishly decorated (reds, blues and yellows, with mostly reds) and had very cheap linens. My room was a perfectly decent size - again, perhaps because it was on a higher floor? The biggest problem I had was with getting a cab - following tips from other reviews, I called downstairs to the bell desk 15 minutes before I needed to leave in the morning, in order to make certain a cab would be there. The phone rang several times, and was finally answered by the front desk. I asked if they would make sure a cab was available for me in 15 minutes, and was told that several cabs were downstairs right then and that they would make certain that there was a cab for me. I went downstairs less than 10 minutes later - no cabs, and when I found a bellman, he obviously had no idea that I had called or talked with the front desk. I waited outside for almost 15 minutes while he tried to find a cab - because of the hotel's location, there aren't many cabs driving by - and finally jumped in a livery car who offered to drive me for a higher price.

We stayed at the hotel on a Thurs and Fri night. We were put on the 12th floor of the hotel--what should be plenty high up to avoid noise issues. The first night we were there the noise was not too bad. However, on Friday night it sounded as if there were riots going on right outside of our windows. There were police sirens and a lot of LOUD commotion going on out on the street from about midnight to just before 3am. Honestly, we thought that Boston was burning down based on the level of the noise we could hear as high up as we were. In addition to the noise issue, we faced another challenge that prevented us from sleeping: the temperature in the room. Apparently because the hotel was built a really long time ago it has some jacked up A/C system. The hotel can have the A/C on, but that also means the rooms can't. So literally, the hallways and lobby are air-conditioned while the guest rooms turn into saunas. The first night was bearable, but on Friday night we had to call for a fan at 2:30am. The hallway was wonderfully cool, but our room was stifiling and we could not even get any air movement. The windows won't open either, so no luck there.

The staff are friendly and courteous and even went out of their way to help us when we arrived, by supplying fresh milk so we could make tea!

We also enjoyed watching some of the TV shows on the free channels available. Check-in was very fast and - as did another trip advisor - we found the reception a little rushed so didn't feel we could ask too many questions at once. The area is noisy and the room didn't have double glazing but whether that bothers you or not depends on your tolerance levels - in fact we actually found it quite entertaining as foreigners to watch the behaviour of the traffic and the nightclub goers! The queues outside the hotel nightclub were a little intimidating when trying to return and the hotel bars were expensive but there is plenty to do, eat and see locally and the hotel is in a great location for the common and surrounding areas.

Later on that morning I found an actual tick crawling on the same bathroom floor. And this was on the sixth floor. The shower head was so low (I am 6 ft. tall) that the spray hit me straight in the stomach. The room was relatively small but we knew that going in. However we didn't expect to have only roughly 8 channels availlable on our TV while the couple staying in the room next to us had many more channels available. I mean we couldn't even watch the Sox game in our room while the other room could. And of course how could I forget the pounding bass from the clubs downstairs penetrating the room walls as well as my head at 1:30 am. Definitely not a pleasant experience when you are trying to sleep.

Thoroughly enjoyed it. Location was closer to many things than I expected, either walking or a short cab ride - really, Boston is a reltively small city in length and width, for a major city. I have stayed at other Wyndham's, and so far this is the best. I had some problems at the others, but usually due to new or slightly trained staff. Even here I could see they didn't always communicate with each other But I had already learned by experience to make my requests during 9-5 and to the \"preferred\" manager, not the desk. To speak to some of the previous posters' complaints, I have a few replies: 1) Most Wyndhams are \"historic buildings\" - not on the national register, but refurnished older hotel properties. And this is common in downtown areas of \"older\" cities with no land available to build on. You want new? Stay out by the airport. I happen to like character and atmosphere over the modern cookie cutter square glass blocks of the standard chains. If you're used to Holiday Inn or Hyatt, and that's what you like, go back there. Me, I want the hotel to reflect the city -- that's part of my vacation. 2) One person got a small room. I happened to get upgraded to a corner suite, a large room that contained both the bedroom area and a full living room area. I tried the adjoining door, it was unlocked and unoccupied, so I explored. That was one of those tiny rooms someone mentioned -- just a shower, twin beds, TV on top of the wardrobe, etc. Even the nighstand had to be in front of the connecting door. Obviously planned as an extension of the suite for a family with children. If you ask for the cheapest room, you may get it. 3) Join the \"Wyndham Preferred\" club online, even if only planning one stay. It almost always gets you an upgrade to \"best available\" at time of check in. Then travel to arrive mid-week in vacation areas, or weekend in business/convention areas, and arrive early in the afternoon. Since joining I have always been upgraded. 4) Next, sign up for their email ads. You will get notices of specials. Several times a year they will also announce a 72-hour half-price sale, at almost any property, any time (no black out dates) for the next year. You just have to reserve during those 72 hours for any dates up to a year in advance. Hint: You can reserve several potential dates, at several locations Your card is not charged until after your stay. You can then cancel the \"unused\" ones with no penalty up to 72 hours before. 5) Of course, as always, still check around with the competition at your finally decided upon location. You can always then call and negotiate - the other place to match Wyndham's offer, or ask Wyndham to match the Hyatt's offer, etc. Although if you did all of the above you probably have Wyndham's lowest price. Once there, if you have a reasonable comlpaint (some people are never satisfied), nicely explain and request a solution. You usually will get it. No, I don't work for them, and I only travel twice a year.

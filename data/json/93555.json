The proximity of this hotel to everything we were interested in was great.

The ONLY gripe I had was the shortage of caffeinated coffee left in the room. Some days they didn't leave any coffee and others only decaf. However, as soon as I complained, I was given a $50 credit so I could order room service coffee. Problem solved.

I know I am almost 2 years behind writing this review but I just joined TA and thought the experience was worth reviewing. That being said, I loved everything about the Sheraton Towers. When we arrived and entered the lobby, I was overwhelmed by the turn of the century charm coupled with the modern amenities and technology. The marble on the floors and walls were immaculate and there was always a computer available for easy internet access. Service was awesome. Upon checking in, the clerk immediately offered an upgrade to our room -- seeing that we were both big guys. She gave us adjoining rooms with a spectacular view of 7th Avenue. Wow!!! What a way to start an awesome weekend for the 1st visit to New York, New York -- a city so nice they named it twice!! Each morning before we ventured out into the big city for breakfast and touring, I got in my morning workout in the best fitness center that a visiting guest could ask for. It was like having Bally's or LA Fitness in your home. Everything that a fitness freak could ask for was available. The Sheraton sits between Central Park and Broadway. Both are well within walking distance.

The room service and food was good and the hotel bar served its purpose. My only criticism i that the bar staff are not the most sociable and they shut the bar bang in 1230am when I thought it stayed open until 1am. However there is an Irish bar opposite that stayed open until 4am and was full of interesting characters. The hotel lobby area is very active and noisy, and you can her the street noise in your room but it is bearable.

It is a good, clean, dependable hotel to stay at if you are participating in a meeting at the hotel. But it is a large, busy hotel and not a charming boutique one. It is about four short blocks from Central Park, about 10 short blocks from the theater district, and close to several subway stops. It is a safe area to walk in, day or night. Each time we go there I think \"there must be a more charming place to stay\" but I have not found it and will probably stay here again if we attend another meeting held there. One small tip, there is a Lindy's restaurant very near the hotel. We thought it would be a reasonable place for breakfast but, although the food and service was OK $42.00 seemed like way too much for the minimal breakfast we had. There is also a restaurant/deli/grocery out the side door of the hotel and on the same block that was much more reasonable but, again, lacking charm, but reasonable food and reasonable prices (for New York). We went to the (almost) top of the Empire State Building and it certainly is a good view of the city. If you like Dim Sum (Chinese lunch pastries) the Jing Fong Restaurant in Chinatown is certainly worth a visit. It is up a long escalator and is huge, The maximum occupancy sign said not more than 800+ people at a time.

This might explain why there was no toilet paper holder, which was strangely disconcerting! The rooms are REALLY small. That makes sense for a hotel near Times Square, but it still surprised me!

I booked through Hotwire and was very pleased with the quality and accommodations during our stay. First off, the location is great. The B, D and E subway station is literally a few steps outside the hotel and Times Square is a few blocks down. For those not familiar with the area/city, I would recommend researching food options in advance as the surrounding places are either overpriced, mediocre or both. I read some of the previous posts about the ongoing renovations, so at check-in I requested a renovated room and we got one. The gentleman at the front desk gave my 4-year-old a coloring book and crayons\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nice touch. We are a family of three so we got a room with two double-beds, and while the rooms are very nice, they are tiny. I think a couple staying in a queen-bed room would be a bit more spacious. I have stayed at Sheratons around the world and this room was by far the smallest but its a fantastic location. The beds were very comfy, it was very quiet on the 20th floor and blackout shades worked great. The renovated rooms are very streamline\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno table but a shelf along the wall, a computer chair and a lounge chair. Housekeeping was very accommodating, the internet in the room worked well (extra fee) and room service was prompt. As others have noted, room service and the mini bar is EXPENSIVE. $5.99 for a diet coke from the mini-bar (or room service). I will say that the amount of food you get is a lot, my husband and I could have easily shared one sandwich/entree. The service charge is steep too\u00e2\u20ac\u201d$9.00. It's fine if you can expense it or use as a tax write-off. Also, we tried to use the mini-bar as a fridge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dDON'T!

At check in, I requested a complimentary upgrade to a standard renovated room, and the concierge sternly told me \"No!\" and that I should be \"grateful\" that I was receiving an early check in time rather than requesting anything complimentary. It was a $40/night upgrade, and I foolishly declined it. As soon as I entered my room, I was completely grossed out. Not only was the room hot and humid with the smell of mildew, but the window was completely boarded up so no sunlight could enter in. I felt like I was in a dungeon. My husband and I went down to the lobby and had to ask for the manager three times. Each time we were told that he was in a meeting, he was not around, or something else they managed to make up.We patiently waited for half an hour. Finally upon speaking with the manager, we argued for 10 minutes before he agreed to give us a room that didn't have boarded up windows (was this too much to ask for?). Temperature control in these rooms was a nightmare. Either the room was too hot and humid, or after we turned off the heat, it was too cold. Don't touch anything in the mini fridge unless you are willing to pay for it. We got charged for items we didn't consume. All of the items have sensors on them and you get charged if anything is moved around. The cable tv didn't work and we didn't even feel like it was worth bothering with. The toiletries are a joke. To be fair however, the room was clean, the beds were comfortable and the room was a decent size for NYC standards. Also, the location is unbeatable. The complimentary starbucks coffee in the room was nice. Upon request, we received bathrobes (one of the bathrobes was torn with holes in it). If you stay in a renovated room, you may not encounter some of the problems we did. However if you don't stay in a renovated room, I definitely do not recommend this hotel. The service however, was a shame. With over 1,000 guest rooms, this hotel is HUGE. It seems to me that this hotel has more guests than it can handle and it can only provide you with the bare minimum.

We were left waiting at the reception desk for around 15 minutes before the manager eventually came. I had booked a twin room with 2 doubles and a double room with 1 queen bed. After a further 10 minute wait, Lucas miraculously found us 2 rooms which were clean- two twin rooms with 2 double beds. When I said this was not what I had booked, Lucas informed me it didn't matter what I booked- the hotel would decide what kind of room I got and they couldn't honour all guest requests- why make it an option then. After further argument and debate we agreed to take the twin room and wait for a double. We took the elevator to the 8th floor which was a construction site. In fact, the adjoining room to room 804 had a 'Danger! Do not enter' sign on the door and there was a dirty towel under the door, obviously to keep the dust out. The room was small, dark and old fashioned. Not at all what I would expect from Sheraton! We went back down to reception to wait a further 20 minutes to sort the mess out. Again, we were told the hotel was full and that no other rooms were ready. Eventually they agreed to give us a renovated room that was a twin and were still trying to find a double. Not how I imagined I would be spending Saturday evening in New York! We went to the room on the 19th floor which was nice but it was a double not a twin. Back to reception again! We decided to leave them to sort it out and go for dinner and hopefully get a room when we returned. We finally got all guests in our party checked in at 10.40 p.m. having travelled for over 18 hours from the UK. We did not receive any apology and were given no information about the hotel or breakfast/restaurant details. I found the staff to be insincere and rude.

He said that since I don't have fever I just need to take some salt water and I will get better. For this I paid 300 dollars!!!

The hotel did not staff to accommodate the volume, however, so the line to check in took 40 minutes, followed by another 25 minute wait to drop luggage because our room wasn't ready! When I asked if they couldn't take the luggage from me during check in to avoid the line to drop it off, I was told No and walked away from with no further explanation. After that lovely introduction to the hotel, we learned that they had unadvertised renovations taking place throughout the entire hotel that started at 6:45 a.m. and continued until midnight. Not kidding. When I called to complain that the two rooms surrounding ours and the one directly above us seemed to be the site of jackhammer parties while my son was trying to nap, it took them SIX calls to connect me to anyone who'd actually answer the phone and talk to me about it. Their answer was that they'd told their third party partners about it (it was not posted on Hotwire), and that they felt it was reasonable to follow that timeline of construction. The result was my older two children (9 and 6 years old) literally crying in frustration as they tried to sleep at 10 o'clock after exhausting themselves sightseeing, and then I was awakened the next morning before 7 by hammering. Seriously unacceptable. Not to mention that the room was SO hot with no working air conditioning that all of us were tossing and turning from that all night, too. My take on this whole situation is this: I understand that hotels have to renovate (and our room at the Sheraton needed it), but the general approach was so flawed and so unfriendly to guests that I can't excuse the hotel for their approach. They didn't segment the construction at all to contain it to certain closed pockets of the hotel at a time, and their idea of which times were appropriate to be banging and hammering and drilling were so out of whack with reality that I couldn't believe it. We did get free parking to supposedly make up for it after nine total calls and a visit to the front desk where they could no longer ignore us ($90 for 26 hours of parking anyway!!) , but believe me, it didn't. Completely frustrating, disappointing, disastrous stay.

Excellent location in Time Square. We could see ball drop ACROSS the street from the hotel. COMMENTS: Transportation: Hotel parking was expensive $42.50 per day...PLUS all the taxes. Less than 24 hours of parking was $100.00. If seeking a true New York experience, I would recommend you take the mass transit system--bus and subway (N-Q-R yellow line) from/to LaQuardia Airport to/from hotel. Take OUTBOUND/INBOUND (make sure of your direction) M-60 bus (15 mins. to/from subway) $2.25 per person with a FREE transfer onto/off of the subway. Then take yellow line (Astoria Blvd.) to hotel (another 22 mins.), getting off at 57 St. and 7th Avenue. Hotel is just two SHORT blocks away. Trip for three was $6.75, instead of $55.00 for taxi ($45.00 plus tip). Fun experience, we felt very safe. ...... 9/11 Memorial: FREE tickets available from Sheraton concierge. The restaurant next store to the 9/11 Memorial ticket place called the Stage Door Deli (Vesey and Church Streets..bright red awning) was delicious, extremely friendly and reasonably priced [for New York]. ..... Hotel Concierge: Ask for FREE places to visit. Concierge was quick to spend \"my\" money. She tried SELLING me tickets for a water taxi tour ($26.95 per person) that would take us to the 9/11 Memorial, only to find out we could get free tickets each morning at the Concierge Desk. Hotel receives a certain amount of free tickets each day. Also, Concierge tried selling us a $1,700 package for New Years to see ball drop. We braved the weather and eight hours instead and for FREE saw the ball drop. Would only do it once though. I would rather walk around. If within three blocks of entertainment on New Year's Eve, you can hear performers. We were at least eight blocks away....two blocks from front of hotel toward ball drop. We COULDN'T HEAR A THING :( No New Year's Eve ombiance...not what you see on TV...only if three blocks away from ball drop. We just STOOD for eight hours talking to people around us. . . . Pets: Hotel is definitely a pet-friendly hotel (under 40 pds.). HOWEVER, no grass in Manhattan. Central Park was five blocks away. There were a few shrubs and little landscaping in front of hotel our dog used. Also, there is a grass area in front of the library a few blocks away. Bottom line, no grass. Stores do allow dogs, but we didn't see many animals, not like in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. We didn't expect this in New York. Chicago and Washington, D.C. are VERY pet-friendly including the outstide... Central Park: This place is wonderful. We walked and walked. Architecture was amazing (bridges, fountain, etc.). We walked for a good three hours with our dog. Ice skating available too. All in all, good trip. Would return to New York again and to the Sheraton.

I called the local reservation person and told her why we needed the suite and she made it happen. I should also say we were only getting one other room there. She was competent and friendly. A few weeks before our stay, I called to ask her if we could have a small lighted Christmas tree in the living room of the suite. She said she had never had that request but would get back with me. It was approved; so I then asked her if I could ship the tree and ornaments directly to her, of course, she said. She emailed me when the shipment arrived so I would not \"worry\".

Starting with check in, which involved standing in line for 40 minutes only to be told a room was not available yet. Fair enough, it was only 12:30p. I showed my Starwood \"preferred guest\" card and asked if we could be assigned a King bed, the person helping us said no problem.

First, let me stay that i average about 200 nights a year in hotels for the past 20 years. I am Platinum with Sheraton, and hold equal or GREATER status with Intercontinental, HIlton, Hyatt, Omni and Peninsula. THis is simply the worst experience i have had in more than 10 years. The check in here took my OVER 90 minutes.(closer to 2 hours) I tried to check in at 4, and waiting in the Platinum line for more than 45 minutes. (THis is supposed to be the expedited line for frequent guests...not so at this hotel). After the ridiculous wait, i was sent to check my bags, where i again waited for 20 minutes. Upon return at 5:30, i waited for more than 35 minutes to get my room key. I was repeatedly told \"The hotel is sold out\"....when i asked why things are taking too long. Wow. So the hotel is telling me that they cannot handle the rooms they have? They cant handle being 'full'? I thought that was the idea. Poor Sheraton. Who told their staff to say that? Speaks volumes for their training, in my opinion. The staff is simply horrible. Customer service, non existent. When i asked to speak to the front desk manager...he never appeared. He walked by, said he would be back...but never appeared. The line was angry. He didnt seem willing to help, and he should have been checking people in. All hands on deck is not a philosophy that this hotel understands. (Balding/african american man...front desk manager). The Gold/Platinum line was being used by anyone. No one at the hotel cared. \"to hell with frequent guests....\" They were understaffed at the front desk. They were understaffed to check bags. It was pure chaos. It was pathetic. If you are just looking for a room, and don't care about anything else..you will find clean room upstairs. It is one of the SMALLEST rooms in NYC, but it is clean...and the new furnishings are nice. For me, there are much...MUCH better alternatives for the same price. Even the mega Hilton down the street is much better than this. Larger hotel, more tourists....older rooms, but i would MUCH rather stay there. Want a really better trip? Try Hyatt.

I am originally a small town, country boy. They have a saying on the farm: \"You cant put lipstick on a pig\". Such is the case here. New beds and carpet mean nothing. The heart of this hotel is terrible. I will never be back. I am smart enough to know better. Sheraton has been trying to improve its image for years. They have succeeded at SOME properties. In my opinion, they have failed miserable here. Now, as i write this message....i can hear EVERY word from the room next door.

Which I am really glad we did because it still wasn't all that. I mean, it was nice and really clean. It just wasn't top notch. By far, still the best hotel I've stayed in in NYC was the Millenium HIlton down near Ground Zero. Simply by virtue of the fact that I refuse to spend more than $200 a night for a hotel, we have missed out on the truly upscale. But, It was so nice and the rooms were wayyy bigger. But if the question is...will we stay there again? Certainly, and more certainly if we get it for the same price.

Apparently so solid that for the third time as a Gold Starpoints member I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upgraded to better room, in fact I probably got one of the most lousy rooms in the hotel. It was on the 17th floor which is unrenovated (Rm 1719). As many other reviewers have wrote here, the lobby is always busy. We got in the Gold/Platinium line but I think the regular line moved quicker. The room was tiny with only one bureau which had 3 small drawers and one of the drawers was taken up with the items from the mini bar. The desk was along the window and you could hear the guy next door talking on his phone if you were sitting at the desk. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much room to get around the front of the bed. It appeared that the room was at least clean, that is until I had to use the bathroom. You pretty much had to close the door if you used the toilet whether you wanted to or not since the door would have hit your knees. The bathroom was very small. There were these disgusting brown splashes (use your imagination) on the side of the tub and behind the toilet tank that were never cleaned the entire time we were there. I just put one of the towels over the area on the tub since I wasn't about to clean it. They did provide us with new shampoo and conditioner every day (many hotels have stopped doing this) and did send up a bowl with a few pieces of fruit and a bottle of water thanking us \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd members for using the hotel. I would have rather had a bigger and cleaner room. Additionally, as a Gold member you are supposed to get a late checkout, 4 PM. When I called down on Sunday to confirm (the 4 pm checkout was listed on the folder with the key)the woman on the phone said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re full, you have to be out by 2\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I questioned the policy of the late checkout she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Read your benefits on the web\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd very curtly. The biggest benefit of this hotel is its location to everything. Radio City is one block over, the subway is right around the corner and Times Square and Central Park is a few blocks away. The bed was very comfortable and one of the only reasons we continue to stay in Starwood properties. However, the bed alone is getting to be not enough since service had really started to decline.

I travel, for both business and pleasure, and spend over 75+ nights in hotels a year. While this may not make me a road warrior I do feel I can compare hotels fairly. After reading the prior posts, I was dreading the stay at this hotel and considered making a change. Because I am a Starwood Platinum member, I contacted Starwood to make a change of location and explained that the reviews on TripAdvisor were primarily negative. After considering other properties and with our dates, there were no other properties that fit our timeline for this trip, so we gambled, kept our reservations, and it paid off for us. I paid a lot of attention to compare our experience with those of others. We arrived at apx 9PM and were prepared for a long check in line. From curbside to in our room was less than 15 minutes. The check in was smooth and uneventful. I took the tip from another TripAdvisor poster and we took our own luggage up, which really did save a lot of time. Upon arrival, I requested a refrigerator, and additional pillows. They were at our door in apx 10 minutes. We had a renovated room , with a king bed, on the 43rd floor. The room was not huge, but by New York standards (and I have stayed in much smaller NYC rooms) was not small. We had plenty of room to move around. Room was very clean, bed linens were a dream, and there was a long multifunctional desk, dresser, valet along one wall, with a large flat screen TV, and mini bar. Closet space was a bit short, but our suitcases fit under the desk very nicely. Bath was small but enough counter space for items. Bath was extremely clean and plenty of towels were provided. We asked for additional towels, and they were replaced daily. Loved that the bedside lamps had power ports. Great for charging phones. Our room faced 57th street and was very quiet. We also had access to the club lounge which was very nice. Both continental breakfast and evening appetizers are served. Cash bar available in the evenings. For us it was plenty. The lounge is available for drinks and small snacks (usually fruit) 24 hours a day. We did find the lounge could be crowded, and I feel that a small reminder such as a sign should be added, to the lounge, to remind people to be aware of their children. Because there are drink dispensers, open food, toasters and I feel that children should be assisted. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horrible, but generally everyone wants to get on their way in the morning and some of the children tended to experiment with the offerings. As a platinum member, wireless internet access was available to me in the lounge and in my room. Great signal with no issued. The lounge was fully staffed and the staffers were extremely courteous, especially given that they were very busy. I did observe long lines at times in the lobby, mostly during late morning and late afternoon. There was a convention that came and went during our stay. We saw a dramatic change during and after the convention was over. Because it was a business convention the lobby bar and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Link\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complimentary computer access area) were packed. After the convention, both areas were easily accessible. Location as previously mentioned, by others, is great. Subway, cab, bus, walking, all easily managed and near attractions. Business center in the basement was great as we had to weigh our luggage before heading to the airport. Check out: our folio was delivered to our room as always, we just had to leave the room, no formal check out was required. We did find the staff to be bit stealth, but when called upon they were there immediately and with a smile. We had no issue with any services. There was construction going on, however we could only tell because there was scaffolding at the front of the hotel, we never saw, or heard, anything that indicated work was in progress during our stay.

Customer service is not in this hotel's lexicon. Arrived at the Starwood Preferred desk at 2:45 pm, only to be told the room was not ready - I had to leave and return a short while later and wait in line all over again. (I guess magically dozens or even hundreds of rooms became instantly available fifteen minutes later.) Two of the elevators going up to the first 20 floors were not working that day - the congestion in the lobby and at the elevators was horrible. One evening I returned from my meetings to find four or five housekeeping trolleys parked in my hallway - with luggage, it would be difficult to negotiate the pathway. Not a sign of any housekeeping personnel servicing the rooms. The situation had not changed five hours later, so I called Guest Services to complain. Instead of an apology, I received attitude. At $500 per night for an ordinary room, I expect something better than attitude. The room was clean, somewhat on the small side; the bathroom was even smaller. The showerhead could not be adjusted up or down or even sideways (apparently everybody is the same size) nor could the spray be adjusted. Nice HD TV with only a fair choice of channels. Windows needed washing months ago. Several computers in the lobby for guest use with a reasonable amount of free internet time, but frequently they were all occupied, all too often with children playing games. Bar in the lobby is pleasant, but with relatively few tables considering the size of the hotel - was never able to find a free table to have a drink at the end of the day despite a four-day stay. Having the bar immediately next to the computers is probably not a good idea. I have previously stayed at the Westin Times Square, but switched because of a somewhat better location. Big mistake - should have stayed at the Westin, where the rooms are bigger and nicer and the staff only rarely demonstrate attitude.

So small that they couldn't put the TV at the foot of the bed, it was located seven feet to the left of the bed. The room was just alright. Besides being small, bathroom was old, the shower was very weak and was a disappointment. It was also very warm. When I called about how to get A/C turned on, she told it's winter and no A/C was available, but the room was 80 degrees (my travel alarm has a temp indicator). She told me to open a window. The windows did open, and was able to get the room to cool down a bit, but the noise is incredible, so you couldn't leave them open.

Barely any space to move around and the 2 of us bumped into each other more than once. The biggest complaint was that the heater/air circulating unit never worked, unless you wanted heat. We couldn't shut it off!! That was indeed frustrating to come back to a hot room. A couple of times we had to prop the door open simply to get the air moving into the room. Someone had totally rigged a standard air return cover (from Home Depot) across the vent holes and half screwed it down. It wasn't flush and looked completely slapped together, but it functioned and I give them 1 star for creativity ;-). All in all, it was \"ok\".

The worst part was the way the hotel handled guests returning from the parade back to the rooms.

We had a Superior room which was higher floor renovated. We were on the 29th floor and last room at end of the hallway. I found the street noise was tolerable; we could here horns and sirens. What I did not like was hearing the room next to use in the morning (they had a ADHD child) thank god they left the room by 7:30. But still, I have rarely encountered a hotel where I could hear the neighboring room (Red Roof Inn anyone? ) I can not figure out why they never addressed this in the remodel. Decorating of the room was nicely done and we were very comfortable. Bathroom ws somewhat small but nothing worth complain over; it suited us fine. LOCATION: Sweet location; nuff said; just close to everything STAFF: we checked in at 6:00pm and had no wait on a Friday. Housekeeping was fantastic and always responded when we said hello & in English :o) no complaints from them and made sure the gratuity showed our appreciation. CLUB LEVEL: Although we did not have club level, I was able to check it out. All rooms had been remodeled. the lounge was nice however they only offered coffee & Water. No sodas or juices. I guy ordered a scotch & Water; $15 WOW. Their brunch is nothing by a continental, no hot foods. They offer nice seating and 3 computer terminals. I like club levels but ones I stay at usually offer beers & sodas & Juice at no charge plus a hot breakfast. So not worth the extra cost, it's a shame they don't offer more. MY NEGATIVES: .... TERRIBLE TV selection if you have kids; only 1 channel for kid shows. They use Dish TV which had a fuzzy reception on some channels. disappointed they didn't offer more for families. ....No Fridge - Screw the filled fridge, people want a fridge they can use. ....Lack of soundproof from walls & windows. muted street noise I can handle, but hearing people in the morning waking up really ruins an otherwise good nights sleep. They should have insulated walls better. In the end we enjoyed our stay. Elevators were FAST, 15 seconds to go up 29 floors. Avoid rooms near elevator, you'll hear that \"woosh\" of the elevators fast system. Location was great and hotel clean and nicely remodeled. I would only stay here again if I was on a higher floor and had nobody in the room next to me. Lastly, AVOID the Pedi-taxis (bike taxis) we took one from the hotel to Toys-r-Us, OUCH $62 for four.

It was small, with two double beds, and only two drawers in the dresser/entertainment stand could be used because the first of the three was filled with snacks. The bathroom was small and there was still a dirty towel hanging on the back of the door. The ice bucket did not have tongs, and there appeared to be some mold on the lid. I filled the bag with ice on my first night and never got a new bag throughout my three-night stay.

The housekeeping staff either was not informed that I was not checked out yet or wanted to re-do the room twice because the coffee and tea had been replenished, some of the bathroom items were re-stocked, the bed made and the trash emptied. I suppose this could be why there was still a used towel in the bathroom when I checked in. The meeting rooms were nice, but cold.

However, if this is what you want, and you don't mind waiting/struggling to get a taxi in the rain or snow because there are 50 million people trying to get one then book this place, because it is nice; however, for me and my friends it would have been more ideal for us to stay away from Times square since we were mainly there to bar hop, see friends, and shop. I recommend not staying in times square even if it is your first time going to NYC...

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read from the reviews that the hotel is ideally situated which means that most of the tourist areas are within walking distance. As soon we landed JFK, I was already looking forward to having a quiet rest in our room as we have arrived late in the evening. As soon as the taxi parked on the side street (not in front), I already noticed the scaffolding in front of the hotel. I told myself that it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be. I was so careful to read the reviews and was sure that the comments about the renovations of parts of the hotel would have already finished. There was no warning on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website nor did Expedia put a warning about renovations. I thought that the scaffolding was part of the preparations for Thanksgiving or Christmas decorations. Check in was a breeze because there was no crowd. We arrived on a Saturday and booked for a week in order to relax and enjoy Manhattan in all its glory as it is the school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn break in Holland. We were given a room on the 12th floor. Upon opening the door, one couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any sigh from excitement or from awe. The room was old and the bed was small. We were with our little girl! The bathroom was clean but the closet was so small we had to leave our clothes in our luggages. The room was clean though. So much for a first impression. I thought that this is New York and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying so much to stay in a hotel, yet hotels in Europe look way too classy. We just had a little bit of freshening up and then we decided to walk on the 7th Ave. towards Times Square. For first timers, Times Square can be very overwhelming. My daughter did not want to go sight seeing anymore. She just wants to be in Times Square all the time. After our dinner which took place at midnight (the City never really sleeps), we went back to the hotel. To our surprise, there was foldable bed outside our door. Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice gesture from the hotel staff, because we really thought they do not provide extra beds for kids. So, we all retired. But, every hour, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep because the room is not soundproof. I could hear the subways non-stop running, cars and more prominently, the honkings. I could also hear the opening and closing of the elevators and the voices of people who are either just arriving or who were returning late from a night out. I did not sleep at all and I asked myself how rotten will I be after 5 days if I am in this state, when I could have involuntarily crashed completely due to jetlag. As soon as I got up, I went to the bathroom and noticed a coffee machine but with Starbucks coffee pads. Wow, that was a plus. It came complete with the Starbucks disposable coffee cups to go. Now, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice consolation from what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been through. I hate American brewed coffee. They taste like black colored tea. And to have Starbucks as you jump out of bed is certainly a luxury. I told myself, this hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad after all. I would have preferred a porcelain mug or real coffee cup but I guess I have to do it the American way. But up to now, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learned how to drink coffee while walking without spilling on myself! But that is forgiveable. My husband tried the fitness and he said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice and good. However, on the morning of checkout, we received a bill (slipped under the door) that includes $40 for the use of the fitness facilities, which I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand because on their website it says that the use of fitness facilities is either $10 per visit or $20 per stay. Our stay was 7 nights and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fathom why on earth we paid $40. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even go to the gym. But upon clarification at the desk, the extra $20 was apparently taken out of the bill. So indeed it was $20 per stay. Breakfast was not included but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind because we wanted to try other breakfast venues. The Link@Sheraton lobby is nice, when it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crowded. In the morning, The Link serves as a Starbucks area and computer lounge. Wifi is free and there are a number of computers and a printer that one can use for free. I found this service good because in the mornings when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a heavy breakfast, you can just stay here and have a croissant, Danish or fruit plus Starbucks coffee while you check your emails or post your tourist shots on Facebook, in full comfort. However, this area of the lobby can get quite crowded no matter what time of day. In the evening, the Link is transformed to a more appropriate bar/computer lounge. On the second day, I literally slept like a baby. I guess it was the jetlag and fatigue to the max that allowed me. But, on the third day, I woke up to the sound of drillings around 9 am. The drilling was so loud and strong I immediately had a headache. I told myself, no worries, we needed to go out anyway so it was a useful alarm. But the following day, after spending a long night out, we planned a short sleep in because anyway, rain was in the weather forecast. So, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been sleeping soundly and had gotten so used to the noise outside when suddenly, a loud drilling sound started again, this time at 7:30 am! The sound was so loud and near that it felt like our heads are being drilled. It did not stop. I have recorded it on my Iphone and up to now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcam surprised how loud the drilling was. Too bad you can only upload photos here on Trip Advisor. Then came the hammering sounds. Now that really pissed me off. Why did Sheraton not put a warning on their website that there are still renovations ongoing, otherwise we could have booked at the Trump Plaza or other hotels where the prices did not differ too much from Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the vacation package that we took? Or we could have been given a room that is far from where the renovations are being done. Sheraton should have taken in consideration that we have booked 7 nights and have come from Europe so it should mean that we were there to have a holiday and a quiet, relaxing week. The hotel should have given extra consideration to those who have booked more nights than just the week-end bookers. But no, this meant that we did not own our time anymore. As soon as the drillings started, we had to jump out of bed, dress up and get out of the hotel. I did not even bothered to ask for an upgrade, because I expected to be just wasting an extra $60 a night just to hear drilling sounds in the morning. All in all, the little extra touches like the Starbucks coffee machine in the room and free wi-fi all served for nothing, if you count how many paracetamols I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken during my stay. I hope my liver is still okay! The renovations and the lack of information about it really degrades this hotel which is so popular. I heard from my Manhattan lawyer friends that this hotel is a favorite venue for President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundraisers so I had such very high expectations. I did not dare complain. Coming from Europe, we are not so used to complaining every time. But I guess I have put my complaint here in Trip Advisor. As for coming back to this hotel, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still thinking. There are other seemingly nice hotels on 7th Avenue and on Times Square so I maybe checking those out first before considering Sheraton again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plain deception on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part. They know that there are floors and wings that will be affected by the renovations yet they played it by ear to see who will complain. They shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have put guests in those rooms if they are really sincere about ensuring customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfort and satisfaction. Of course there are expectations when you book a hotel. There are expectations of an excellent client service and when in the U.S. there is a high degree of expectation that customers will receive the best service. We did not have demands. We just wanted to sleep and wake up fully rested.

My wife and I had some time off and decided to spend 5 days in one of our favourite cities after our Paris plans got messed up. Im an airline pilot, so when we travel, I never book a hotel until I am actually in the city I want to be in. I used Hot-wire and found and entered 4 star in midtown as the perimeters. Up popped the Sheraton. On to Trip Advisor I went. $183 a night all week, reg $479 (its NYC). Armed with knowing about the reno'd floors and the old ones, off to the hotel we went. Our booking (3rd party) said one Queen bed. Checking in they were totally out of Queens. I knew that my low price I paid was not going to give me a new room or any favours. That said, my wife is pregnant and needs her space while sleeping. I talked with the reception lady named Joy, who was awesome and totally helpful. She was so concerned about my wife's interest and well being. We found one Queen bed after some work, but Joy worked some magic, and our compromise couldn't have worked out better. We ended up on the 40th floor, with 2 double beds, at the end where it was quite, and super new. I stay in 10-14 hotel rooms a month and I know this floor was just redone. Still had that new carpet smell. The rooms are massive for NYC, probably the biggest ive seen in the city. I felt I was in another city they were that big. The hotel is busy as its a conference centre, its NYC, it supposed to be. Times Square is 5 blocks south, you can not get a better spot if your new to this city. The 7th Ave subway is 500ft away, Letterman tapes around the corner, and for you fellow Canadians, theres a Tim Hortons 3 blocks south. The not so good, (minor stuff) Having stayed at a lot of Sheratons around earth, I cant understand why they nickel and dime you on little things. The is no free bag check. They sell it out to a 3rd party company that charges $3 a bag. Even though I only travel carryon, I find this really lame. At $500 a night, I don't think you should charge someone $6 to watch there stuff for 2 hours, plus its not Sheratons fault if something happens. First place I stayed in, that they do this. Also I didn't like the fact a guy told me it was because of space issues. Its one of the biggest places in the city! Free Wifi in lobby, great. $14 a day in the room, Seriously...... I know other hotels do it but its weak. If you want a fridge in your room its $29, really?.... Final thoughts, If you have never been to NYC and are one of those folks who need a big room to feel like they got a good hotel, Stay here. If it shows up on your Price line, or Hotwire, your fine here. If you like dealing with a known chain, stay here. If you don't like crowds, want a boutique hotel, or find the lobby or street noise to loud, don't come to NYC.

The hotel put us in the outside most room adjacent to the construction. The noise of the power drill and jack hammer was so loud that I had to shout into the phone when I called the front desk. I asked for a new room and was told by the front desk that the computer system was down. The manager at the front desk assured me that she would call me when the system was up. Well, the system stayed down all day. I came back to the room to rest at 2 PM but could not stay in the room because of the power tools. I ended up in the lobby until 5 PM when construction stopped. In the meantime, the line to check in wrapped around the lobby. The next day, the system was up. I went to the front desk to ask for another room to get away from the construction. I was told a room would be ready in an hour. I came back an hour later and was told the room was not ready but they would call me. I came back at 5 PM and the room still was not ready but that they said they would call me when it was. The hotel never called. By this time it was Friday night and I assumed correclty that the construction would not continue over the weekend. We left Monday morning without having ever received a call from the hotel.

Our room was on the 11th floor, very close to the elevators, and next to some kind of utility room, which was under construction. Our window was blocked by scaffolding, and we were both startled and taken aback to find a workman standing on that scaffolding, working directly outside our room. This tended to interfere with our view and with our privacy while in the room, so we kept the drapes closed most of the time.The drapes were stained, and the carpet had large dark stains as well. The room was very small, even by NYC standards, and at more than $500 a day, it was not inexpensive. The bathroom was not clean: the toilet seat was dirty, and the fixtures had fingerprints and water spots. We complained. A desk clerk explained that we were in an \"unrenovated\" room, but we could get an upgrade to a renovated room if we paid an extra $40 and became Starwood members. However, this room would not be available until later that day. We told the clerk we'd deal with the room issues later, as we needed to leave for a pressing appointment. We wanted to think about it: we didn't like our accommodations at all, but were offended that we had to pay extra to upgrade from an already-expensive room. We did not return until well after midnight, too tired to deal with switching rooms. This is unfortunate, because we could hear the noisy elevator whistling in the elevator shaft and dinging loudly throughout the night. Construction began at 8:00 a.m. with loud banging on the scaffolding. About an hour or so later, a workman began using a saws-all or similar loud power tool in the utility room next to our room. My husband and I had to yell to hear each other. \"Let's get out of here!\" we yelled, packed as fast as we could, and left. And of course, although we never did move to the upgraded room, we had nevertheless been charged the $40. We complained again. This time, the desk clerk was very helpful. She removed the upgrade charge, reduced the overall charge by about 20%, and threw in some extra Starwood points. I don't have a problem with that employee - I think she did everything she had discretion to do. I do have a problem with the Sheraton, however.

The room was handsome, well appointed, if slightly NY small. The bathroom had a rather cramped feel but what I expect in mid-town Manhattan. It was clean with great views, (the 45th floor looking toward Times Square) and remarkably quiet for the location. The bed was exceptional with good pillows. Having 24 hour access to the club on the 44th floor was great. Coffee and juices were always available and the continental breakfast in the morning and hors d'oeuvres in the evening were a real convenience. It was a good place to begin the day and to unwind. The views are stunning in all directions and the staff excellent. The lobby had the feel of a convention hotel, rather open and loud. The Sunday I was there was amazingly crowded with lines of people checking in. It got you ready for the streets outside which are teeming at all times. There is also a subway line, the \"E\" train, right at the corner which I found very handy for getting around the city. This was even more important as it rained frequently and cabs were at a premium. I would not usually stay right in mid-town but found this hotel to be the perfect place for that area...just far enough away from Times Square and close to transportation.

Central Park is a few blocks uptown and Times Square/Broadway theater district is a few blocks down. 5th Avenue shopping is a couple of blocks over. Subway stations are all around you. The property has a ton of rooms, so the lobby always feels like Grand Central Station. It's not a quiet place to hang out. But it's big, easy to get through, and you probably don't want to hang out there, anyway. I've stayed here one other time prior to the beginning of remodeling. That room was acceptable, but somewhat dated. This time, I was upgraded to a higher floor and a remodeled room. FANTASTIC. Furnishings are sleek and modern. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and had a very nice walk-in tiled shower. Being up high, the views can be very good. If you're having to pay top dollar for a not-remodeled room on a low floor, compare to other hotels first, because what you get otherwise will be mediocre. It seems as though only the top floors of this Sheraton have been re-modeled. Not sure if they'll keep working their way down. My only point of dissatisfaction: as I was leaving, I asked for a cab to the airport from the bellman. Before I could get the words out of my mouth, he had grabbed my bag and threw it into a town car (not a cab), saying it was $40 flat rate. Yes, that was the case and it was a smooth (not smelly), comfortable ride with a very nice driver. Since it was a Sunday morning, there was no traffic and I got to the airport in no time. The driver took neighborhood streets, thereby avoiding a tunnel/bridge toll ($6.00). So, the fare in total ended up being about $10 more than a cab, which I didn't mind all that much. But not really being given the choice (or having been forced to make a big stink), was off-putting. I think the bellmen are in cahoots with those drivers to send them business.

The place is dated - and the updates are more of the same - old-school \"luxury\" with dark decor, dark woods, wallpaper and tiny spaces. While Sheraton says that the rooms have been updated, I found it hard to believe that I was staying in an \"upgraded, recently renovated\" room. The furniture was dated, window treatments out of style and the bathroom beyond tiny. About the nicest thing in the bathroom was the marble countertop, which had no function other than to hold the sink and toiletries. For the price of this hotel, I would expect better amenities, upgraded toiletries, larger bathrooms and fixtures, and a more open, airy feel. That said, if you prefer the heavy, dark, \"old world\" luxury feel, this may be the place for you, One of the best things about this location is that it is within 2-4 minutes walk of Times Square, and being on the north end and really close to the theaters themselves, you get the convenience of Times Square without the noise. I've stayed AT Times Square in multiple locations, and all but the DoubleTree, Hilton, and W suffer from the major noise issue. they charge for holding luggage, which at this price point is absurd. I've stayed at similar properties in the Financial District and on 5th Avenue who did not charge for holding luggage. Be warned, the hotel's site often shows that it has a parking package, which leads you to believe that they have a parking garage. This is NOT the case. The garage adjoining the hotel does not belong to Sheraton and you will have to end up paying $50-$60 to park your car there. This was not a nice lesson to learn, especially since their website (at the time I made the booking) did not explain this. Also, stay away from the \" free upgrade\" to king rooms - unless you're on the executive/Club Sheraton floor, these are beyond tiny and difficult to maneuver, and tend to be stuck in the corners of the building with 3-4 other rooms whose doors open onto each other so the noise and foot traffic are high.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Adequate Room\u201d", "Author": "bawdyjane", "ReviewID": "UR117945424", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location in NY - if you're a walker I completely recommend it, a couple blocks from Broadway, great eateries at your fingertips (have yet to eat at the hotel yet) Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable and bathroom nice - I had one of the renovated rooms but understanding is that all rooms are now up to date.

Initially upon check in, the service was good as we thought we'd been upgraded to a better room - we later discovered this wasn't the case. We should've been staying in a refurbished room, as arranged by my travel agent back in January 2011, but were swiftly 'upgraded' to the 30th floor. The beginning of our problems. While we enjoyed our first trip to New York, we came back after a trip out to find our room was open. I assumed it had been left open by a cleaner and wasn't too worried as all our things were still where we left them and nothing had been taken. However, the next night, we returned to our room to find we couldn't get in. I spoke to a rather rude woman on reception who didn't appear to understand English when I explained the situation. She re-activated our key card only on the production of my driving licence (good job I brought it!) as she wouldn't let me back in the room without any ID - even though our passports were still in the room. This was cleared up and again, we gave the hotel staff the benefit of the doubt as it is a busy hotel and mistakes will undoubtedly be made. But there's more. The next day we recieved a receipt which made absolutely no sense whatsoever, but mentioned a $213:00 bill which we could not work out what was for. Upon checking out on Sunday morning (4th) we were advised that $213:00 had been taken from my partner's account without her authorisation (she gave her card details to hold $50:00 upon checking in in case of use of room service/mini bar). We were told this $213:00 charge was for parking (no, I didn't drive all the way from England) and, would you believe, a toothbrush. This money had already been deducted from my partner's account and we had to argue our case to a rude member of staff who offered very little in the way of an apology. To make matters worse, my partner was told she would have to wait up to a week until the money was processed back into her account. We were asked to store our cases for a charge of $3:60 per case, despite their glorious incompetence, and my partner had to ask for this to be waived. My partner was also told to be quiet when she asked the memeber of staff dealing with this what was happening with her money as he 'was working'!! The level of customer service, we feel, was very poor indeed. We've stayed in many hotels all over the world and never come across such appalling service. I am not a grumbling old man, nor have we ever complained about poor service before, but we do feel we deserve at least an apology or compensation, neither of which have been offered. Despite this, we did have a fabulous time in New York. We found the rooms to be comfortable, the beds were fantastic, and our room was clean. The cleaners were by far the friendliest of staff. Overall, this didn't spoil our holiday, but we have now been inconvenienced as we are now missing \u00c2\u00a3135:00 until the end of the week (provided it actually goes back into my partner's account).

I usually stay at the Sheraton, primarily because of it's convenient location. Service is never good, the hotel has never been anything special, but it works for business travel. I think it's now time for a change! This week I arrive at 3:00 pm (check in time) to be told that there were no king size bed rooms, even though I had reserved one. My option, I was told, was to take a king bed in the older, non-remodeled part of the hotel or take two doubles in the new section. I opted for the newly remodeled rooms. After all, the navy and emerald green theme n the older rooms is about 10 years past it's prime. When I arrived at my room, it was very dirty. It appears that the remodel crew simply grouted over mildew in the shower (see photos) and the carpets looked like tey had not been vaccumed in weeks. There was crumbs and garbage from previous guests. Clearly the housekeeping staff had not done a good job, there was even a NY Yankees baseball cap in the corder by the drapes... left by a previous guest I assume, in a location that the housekeeping staff just never looks at. Things get worse. When I return from my business day on day one, at 7:00 pm, the room had not been made up. I called service express and asked that housekeeping clean the room. At this point I was not really upset, since i was going to dinner anyway. They said \"no worried.\" When I got back from dinner, at about 9:00 ... I returned to a dirty room still. I called again, and was told that they would be right up. 10:00pm, no housekeeping and another call to service express. By this time i was upset and asked for a confirmation of time when the housekeeping staff would be there to clean my room. No return call, and no housekeeping. Finally, I went to bed (in the other bed, good thing I had two doubles I guess.) In the morning I had to walk to the linen closet to get my own fresh towels. I was never happier to check out. The hotel renovation is well designed, for sure. But the hourecleaning staff and overall service quality has me now looking for a new place to stay when in New York. I have been told that the Westin Element hotel. just up the street at 39th and 8th is new, clean AND less expensive. I will remain true to starwood .. but give up on the Sheraton.

We got a really great deal by booking our airfare and hotel through Expedia, and unless I get a great deal again, I probably will not stay here again if I am ever back in NY. Let's start with the good: the location is nothing short of AMAZING. There are four different subway lines within a few minutes' walk of the hotel, it's only a five minute walk to Central Park in one direction and Times Square in another. There are also a lot of food places close by. The beds were very comfortable (and I was on the 7th floor, not in a renovated room, but we'll get to that later). The room seemed generally pretty clean and bed bug free. A few other reviews mention not being able to control the temperature of the room, but our room had temp controls right by the A/C, thank goodness too, because we were there during a huge heat wave. And now, the bad: our bathroom smelled like mildew. It was gross, and there was really nothing that could fix it, so we ended up keeping the door shut at all times. Service was not great, but that seems to be the norm in that general area of the city. I left a necklace in my room by accident, and realized it on my way to the airport in a shuttle. I called the hotel to ask if they could find it and was treated as though I was inconveniencing them. They found my necklace, but refused to mail it to me, and instead told me I'd have to come back and get it. Again, I was on a shuttle. On my way to the airport. Not exactly in a position to tell the van driver and everyone else to turn around so I could get my necklace. Luckily, I have a friend who lives in the city who picked it up, and if that had not been the case, I am sure I could have spoken to someone else who could arrange to have it mailed, but I still did not appreciate the (word for word) \"I'm not mailing nothin' to ya,\" response I got. Rooms are small, but again, that seems to be the norm in NY hotels. Walls are thin, but the floor I stayed on seemed relatively quiet, so that was not an issue for us either; however, I could see how it would be an issue for those who have big groups of kids staying on their floor, or those with rooms at the end of the hall near the elevators. We requested a renovated room at check in, but were told they only gave renovated rooms at an extra $40/night. No thanks. I've seen other reviews that say the same, but other reviews where people were upgraded at no extra cost, so I suppose it just depends on who is checking you in. Our room wasn't bad, but is definitely showing wear and tear. We didn't spend that much time in the room so it worked for us.

My only critique is the bathroom. It was very small and there seems to be a bit of a shower design flaw. It's a walk-in shower and the edge needs to be a bit higher as I found it impossible to not get water all over the floor. Regardless, this room was beautiful, comfortable, and very quiet.

Thanks to TripAdvisor I knew to request a room that had been renovated. The hotel is in the process of renovating all the rooms, and you can tell which floors have been done by the color of the carpet. The old floors that we saw from the elevator had blue rugs and walls, the new floors have a tan and black theme. There is scaffolding all around the hotel as part of the renovation. The room wasn't large but fine by NYC standards - we had a room with two double beds and there was room to walk around them, a dresser was attached to the wall, and there was a small table with two chairs by the window. There was a flat screen TV, and all the lamps had outlets in their base so it was easy to set up chargers for our phones. The mattress was new in good condition. I brought a flashlight to inspect for bed bugs and am pleased to report everything was nice and clean, even in all the creases of the mattress. The look is contemporary with dark wood, silver handles and tan rug and drapes. The bathroom was small but clean with a marble counter, tub and shower with a curved bar. The amenities were a generic brand but the soap was Manderin-Lime citrus and I really liked the smell. They provided a hair dryer, but no shower cap. They did have some cotton balls, Q-tips and an emery board in a little kit. One thing I missed was they did not have a magnifying mirror. They charge for wireless internet in the room which is very annoying. But I will give them credit for trying to offer some connectivity in the lobby. They had an area set off in the lobby that had about 10- 12 computers free for hotel guests to use with one printer, and free wifi if you had your own computer. It was outside the bar which served Starbucks coffee in the mornings until 3:00 PM. That was a very popular spot and the computers were always busy whenever I passed by. In addition, there is one terminal and printer located near the Registration desk that is dedicated to printing Boarding Passes. I was very pleased to find that so I didn't have to wait for one of the other computers to be free. Some reviewers have complained about the service, but we had no problems checking in and out. The rooms have those horrible mini-bars where if you move anything you are charged. My niece made the mistake of moving a can of coke to put in her leftovers but they called downstairs and had no problem removing the charge from the bill. The location is great - right on 53rd so it was just a block away from MoMA. Close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, etc. There was no need to use Room Service or the hotel restaurant as there are so many other choices nearby. The Sheraton has an exit on 53rd and if you turn right just past their parking garage is the 53rd Gourmet Deli open 24 hours - I thought the food was so-so but they sell drinks, etc. and you don't even have to cross a street. Across 7th Ave is the 810 Deli http://www.810deli.com Within a few blocks on 7th Ave are Lindys, Stage Deli, Carnegie Deli, Fluffys Deli, not to mention a Starbucks on every corner. Two chains which were new to me are Europa Cafe one short block away at Broadway and 53rd - great sandwiches and fresh made to order salads https://www.europacafe.com/ and Pret a Manger which is a UK chain and had wonderful oatmeal for breakfast and very good strong coffee http://www.pret.com/us/ .

I understand the hotel is undergoing renovation and some issues may be fixed, but while that happens I believe there's a high likelihood of these things recurring. I stayed at the Sheraton New York two weeks ago, on an overnight business trip. Upon arriving around 11 PM - which I had specifically noted on the SPG site that I would do - I was told that they didn't have much available, and specifically no rooms with a king size bed as I requested and they were sorry they didn't have anything \"nicer\" as I should have called them directly to let them know of my arrival (I am Platinum with Starwood, so usually get upgrades). I didn't think this was a big deal, since it was a one night stay anyway, but I did take exception to being told that i should have contacted the property directly - I entered my information on the SPG site, so it was on their reservation, and any hotel should be looking at who they have coming in that day, their status and assign rooms accordingly without asking guests to go out of their way. But again, no big whoop as long as the room was clean and working. I was assigned room 1130, one of the ones not remodeled yet. The furniture was in my impression pretty beaten up and the walls had some scratches, plus the AC was old and rattly, but what was really appalling was the level of cleanliness of the room. I found all of the following: a couple of women's hairpins in plain sight on the floor (which leads me to believe it wasn't vacuumed that day), a used bar of soap in the shower, a crumpled rusty colored towel under one corner of the sink ledge in the bathroom (you could tell it had been there a while catching water), a speck of - um, how should I say this - 'debris\" inside the toilet bowl, holes in my pillowcase, and a thick layer of dust over the TV console (you could actually write on it). All unacceptable, but as they were sold out there's not much they could do (some of these things I found immediately, and some of them after going to complain a first time, and i needed sleep...). I must say, I did not sleep very well either, concerned about the cleanliness of the overall place. I took pictures of some of the items as they starting adding up, I've added them to this review. I also called the Guest Services desk to inquire about wifi, and even adjusting for New York bluntness, the person who picked up the line was fairly rude (I was basically told \"there's just a cable connection in the room... there's a charge for it too\" in not a very friendly tone). When i tried to use the Wi Fi from the lobby, it was unusable as it was so slow that pages would not come up. On the bright side, when I complained to the Front Desk, the young gentleman manning it was very apologetic that night, took my name, gave me the manager's name and told me he would relay my complaint. Alas, I've never heard from the hotel manager to this day. When I left the next morning I asked for directions to a specific address, to which I received just a finger pointing to a door and the words \"That way\". Gee, I can find the door towards the side street thanks, I was asking for something a bit more specific. I also asked for my bill on logo paper - I was handed another copy on plain white paper. Obviously listening is not a strong suit here. Based on my experience I would never again stay in this hotel.

I haven't read any of the reviews, but the biggest plus of the Sheraton is clearly and without question, the location. I applaud location very much in my reviews, but the Sheraton actually helps to make you close to any one of the boroughs as well as steps from the middle of Times Square. The Subway entrances are right around the corner, and everyone that has been to New York knows that the subway is the best and quickest way to travel in the Big Apple. Upon arriving at the hotel, we immediately needed to find the D train to get to 161st St. I'm sure I don't need to say that this is the stop for Yankee Stadium, but if I do, well, I just did. Anyway, the D train is right around the corner from the hotel also the RNQ is just south on 49th St. and those will take you right into Queens. With the red line also just west, you can end up right at Battery Park in minutes. Or why take anything; this hotel is right by all the excitement and mere blocks away from spending the day in Central Park. This is not just a great location, but an exceptional one that will allow you to take in so many sights in a short period of time. The lobby is huge and always bustling. The reception area is convenient and the staff is very nice. The elevators are quite large and can easily accommodate a good size group with their luggage in tow. They always seem to arrive quickly as well. The room is quite compact but offers all amenities. It is probably a more ideal spot for couples, considering the small size. But, it worked for us. The room also has a wall to wall desk that hides the A/C that is just under. It is equipped with internet connection, for a fee though. Nice flat screen TV with HD channels including HBO and Showtime. Also, the closet is basic, but fully functional. The fridge can be a little annoying considering that nothing can be moved without a charge hitting your account, not very good when you are hoping to use the fridge. The room also has a basic closet and safe, nothing that we need to write about. The bathroom is of a nice size and of good water pressure. The room need some additional hooks though, we ran out of space to hang towels. But, kudos to the hotel for stocking us with many towels of various sizes, we never had to call the front desk for additional anything. The Beds are Sheraton, so you know they are comfortable and with four pillows for each bed, you will sleep like a King. Also the drapes and window coverings darkened the room beautifully.

The hotel has an in house Starbucks coffee bar, which is very helpful in the mornings, although Manhattan has Starbucks everywhere you look. The hotel restaurants are nothing special, but it doesn't much matter, as New York's best deli, Carnegie deli, is a couple of blocks north just out the front door of the hotel. Driving around Manhattan is not for the novice, as cab drivers cut you off and the traffic patterns can seem random and intimidating to the uninitiated. I would recommend walking or taxis, or subways. The hotel elevators can have a wait at peak times, which can be annoying, so allow yourself a few extra minutes for elevator waits around 8 to 9 am and 5 to 6 p.m. The fitness center located in the basement is first class, and has weights, cardio and work out machines. There is a view of the street life from the cardio room which is fun. The rooms are furnished in woods, and have a clean feel and are average size for New York. A great location, very touristy, in the heart of New York. Very convenient to New York attractions and Broadway theatres. The buffet breakfast, if part of your hotel package, is very complete.

That is understandable. I asked if we could possibly try to get a room with 2 beds for my friend and me, and the surly woman at the front desk kept repeating over and over again that because we made our reservation on hotwire, we were not guaranteed 2 beds, and that there was nothing she could do. I understood that, but it seemed as if she was making no effort to accomodate us, treating us like second class citizens compared to non-hotwire/priceline guests. I asked her if the hotel was sold out of rooms with 2 beds and she just kind of gave a blank stare. She told us to come back later because our room was not ready. She then pointed to the baggage drop off area, which also had a lengthy line-up that took around 20 minutes. We came back at 3:30 and waited in the long check-in line again. I was lucky this time and got a new person checking us in, who was more helpful, and it was not a problem to get 2 beds.

We decided to get wireless internet. However, at the end of the stay when they slid the bill under the door, we found out that they charged us each a seperate wireless fee since we had used 2 devices! This was ridiculous. They wanted us to pay $14.99 x 2 x 3 nights since we each had our own computer? I called to complain and was transferred to the front desk. The phone kept ringing but no one answered. I was determined to NOT wait in the long line-up so that is why I wanted to call. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes, I hung up and called again, was transferred, and same thing, no one answered. Third time, I told the woman on the phone that no one was answering and she said there was nothing she could do since she was in another section of the hotel. I said, can you please get someone to call my room? I dont think it's acceptable to wait over 15 minutes to speak to someone. She said the would get someone to call my room. I waited 30 minutes and no one called. Then I called again, and said its the 4th time I've tried to speak to someone, so he transferred me to someones voicemail. Unacceptable. I called a 5th time, and the lady who picked up said she would get someone to call me. 20 minutes later, someone finally called. I explained that I did not think it was fair to have to pay wireless twice. After a bit of arguing, she agreed to reverse the second charge. Time for check out. We left the hotel room at noon and saw that there was a huge line, as usual, to check out. It would have taken at least 30 minutes. I saw that there was a priority desk with a bored looking employee. She seemed annoyed that we went to her, but she did check us out there. We then went to to long lineup at baggage check to drop off our bags. We waited 30 minutes again to drop off our bags, and they charged $3.25 per bag. I was very disappointed with this hotel.

We got there around 2:30 PM, but the receptionist said that we can't get to the room until 3:00 PM because that was the check in time that the hotel had indicated. Absolutely no flexibility here!!! So we waited at the lobby along with many others who had come earlier just like us. When we got to the room, it smelled really bad. It had that sewage smell, and the smell was mainly from the bathroom. The bathroom vent was very dirty, you could see the dusts ont he vent. The room was tiny-- two people can barely get around the room. We called the guest service for extra towels. We waited 1.5 hours. During that time, we had called 2 more times and we heard women chatting and laughing in the background noise. But all they said was that she'll put that into order. So fed up with their slow response, we headed down to the concierge desk. There was only one person (understandable) at the concierge. At first we thought he was helping a lady in front of us. But as the time passed by, we could hear their conversation--- they were chatting about their life!!!! It had nothing to do with the hotel area nor was it related with hotel. The concierge didn't even acknowledge us despite the line was forming longer behind us. Finally after 20 minutes of waiting, he asked us what we needed help on. After asking for extra towels, he immediately said that that wasn't his reponsibility-- we told him that the guest service didn't respond, then he told me to call the manager. We've never called the manager at a hotel, but this time we did. After hearing our complaint, the manager was very apologetic.

I'm not a fan of waiting on long lines and dealing with a lot of people on a daily basis. This hotel is massive and as such the inside is always bustling. There's a lot of noise in the lobby and even the hallways. I check in later (around 10PM) on a Sunday night. When I checked in, I waited about 10 minutes on the Gold/Plat line. When I finally checked in I couldnt get up the elevator because an event downstairs just let out. After standing in a push/shove line for the elevator for 20 minutes I finally got to the room. The room was small and basic, not very updated. It was clean, so I was happy with it, but other Sheratons in the area are much nicer. The room was also small, one of the smallest I have seen in a Starwood hotel. I dont think I received an upgrade but if I did, I would hate to see the room that I booked. I also had a snafu because after 1 night of my 5 night stay I would be hitting the SPG Platinum level which would entitle me to free lounge and gym access. In most hotels when you have a situation like this they will honor your achievement and provide you with access. But this hotel is very inflexible so dont expect them to go out of their way for you. However, with such a large staff, I noticed that some staff are happy to go out of their way for you while others could care less. Thankfully, those that were willing to help made the experience a little better for me. It's important to note that without club access breakfast will cost you $35/pp (although you can find reasonable breakfast down the street at Pret) and if youre not Platinum, the gym will cost you $10/day. The location is great and the rooms are clean although simple. The reception and elevator waits are annoying and the reason why I probably wont stay at this hotel again.

The hotel, however, was not four star quality at all and should not be listed as such. Upon checking in, the man at the desk loudly exclaimed that I had booked the room on hotwire which was rude and not relevant since I knew I had booked the room on hotwire. All he needed to say was the room is paid for, we just need a credit card for incidental charges, but it really felt as if he was attempting to embarass me. The room was fine. I will say the bed was very comfortable. However, the towels in my room were stained and dirty and there were urine stains on the toilet seat. I'm not sure how this could happen since I had to wait until 3:00 to check in so that the room could be cleaned. The minibar did not open nor did the shade on the window. From what I've read in the other reviews, I'm guessing that I received an older room because I booked on hotwire, but it looked as though the room had been recently remodled so I am not sure. Not a huge deal, but the doorman is not very attentive which could be because there is so much going on, but I asked him five times to hail a cab for me and kept being interrupted by people asking other things of him. Instead of telling the other people to wait a moment, he handled their needs and left me standing there. That should not happend at a \"4 start hotel\".

Rooms are always small, but functional - plenty of electric outlets, drawers, and always some shower gel not only soap. Recently opened lounge on the 44th floor has three free computers with printer, snacks in the evening and breakfast with some fresh berries. Seems they are trying to keep attracting frequent starwood guests, especially since one never gets complimentary suite upgrade in this location (needs to be pre-arranged with VIP manager according to the front desk). Another Platinum priviledge that front-desk does not always mention is free local and toll-free calls. Still there are some negatives: 1. bed is rather uncomfortable compared to W bed. And they only use one clean sheet to put a blanket/duvet on. So that when you are covered you are under a clean sheet which is not completely enveloping the duvet. I guess they save by not using a second sheet or using sheets that you can put the duvet in. 2. unless you are very high and away from the elevators, it can be pretty noisy. 3. front desk is not well organized when it comes to separation of Diamond/Gold and general line. In fact the first time we checked in - there was a huge line of some 10 or so people for the former and no line for the latter.I have never seemed a similar line ever in any hotel and we spend probably 2/3rds of the year in hotels. 4. this is a big hotel and sometimes housekeeping seems to cut corners (see my pics). Today I moved day-bed by the window by pushing it towards the wall to create a little more spacein this small room. The floor was full of debris. Requested \"guest services\" send housekeeping to vacuum - nobody came after three requests. Finally, succeeded in being connected to a housekeeping manager (not after a little fight with \"guest services\" who would point blank refuse to do that without knowing the reason) who eventually sent housekeeper to vacuum the room. Guess you need to be a real VIP to be heard here, and Starwood Platinum does not count. 5. rooms have small mini-bar fridges with warning messages not to store your stuff in them, however, if you want to keep some water, wine, beer etc cold, you will be charged $25 per fridge that they can send for you. Bear in mind this is not very typical for NYC, with Sheraton Tribeca providing nicely sized complementary fridge, Grand Hyatt having small fridges in all of their renovated rooms, and W Time Square not minding at all if you empty their mini bar for personal use. Of course, a little dirty floor, etc, does not take away from the fact depending on where you need to be, this is still a great place for a short stay.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cSheraton Towers NYC\u201d", "Author": "ConnieColumbus_OH", "ReviewID": "UR115339119", "Content": "This hotel is centrally located and very appealing.

I requested feather pillows which were delivered, the room was stocked with only the bouncy foam ones, and the bedding had a bit of a musty smell. The primary issue for me was noise - I could hear the neighbor due to sound leaking in where the walls meet the windows (and the fact that they were just obnoxiously loud).

Let me give you a little background. I stayed for a conference in May 2011 in the Sheraton Hotel and Towers Manhattan, NYC. If you book your room at the hotel website or over the phone you will be quoted one price for the standard room throughout whole hotel. However, you cannot pre-specify the room or the floor you will be staying. Yes, when you check in- you are assessed! The exact criteria may not be apparent to you at the beginning, but when you have a little time, spend it by the lifts and you will understand. The hotel has 3 different lifts leading to 3 separate parts of the hotel. (6-20 floor, 21-28th floor and 29-50th floor), hence the lifts do not stop at the other levels. Than look at the dress code of the people using these different lifts and you will understand. Yes, if you are assigned to 6-20th floors you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it in NYC. How are the rooms? I had the benefit to see all 3 levels. The common ones (6-20th) are old, dirty, the EC blows more dust than air, carpets stained, dust all around, bathrooms without hot air extractor, you name it. I did not have bed bugs (another reviewer mentioned) during my first night in lower section. Look at few of the other reviews and you will get a representative picture. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (21-28th) has renovated rooms in a generally better standard and the upper newly decorated rooms (29-50th floor) are really quite smart. BUT, the guests pay the same rate! Now, I tried to ask the employees about the 3 levels for the 3 different lifts and kind of people (who pay the same price!) As you would have expected, I drew a blank; at least 4 times I tried. High likely that it is management policy to keep the assignments confidential, woun't it be. Now are you up for the challenge- and believe that you can manage to get value for your money- than don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come with shared transport which drops you at the side entrance, the limos and good taxis drive you to the front entrance where a porter greets you, be smartly dressed, have the usual gold or platinum CC for your account, you know. If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up for this challenge and you are concerned you will end up at the lower floors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have to say you would be foolish to spend your money for an unpleasant, uncomfortable and perhaps degrading stay.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings!\u201d", "Author": "chinny188", "ReviewID": "UR112733121", "Content": "Excellent location and the room was nice (only when we were moved to the refurbished part of the hotel otherwise the 'older rooms' were antiquated).

Only, this was 11 at night and it would take \"at least an hour\" to get maintenance to my room. For the second time, I was told, this time by a manager, \"what do you want me to do about it?\" (Their solution was that I type up a very sensitive client document on a public computer in the lobby of the hotel. Yeah, no.)

We had booked 3 rooms (for 4 nights) through Virgin Holidays and asked for 2 of the rooms to be connecting/adjoining due to not wanting our daughters somewhere else in the hotel. We checked in at around 4pm to be told that 2 of the rooms were ready but the 3rd wasn't. We didn't think this to be a problem so left all our luggage in the 2 rooms, freshened up and went out for a wander and dinner. We returned at 7.30pm (by which time we'd been up nearly 21 hours) to be told that the 3rd room still wasn't ready. We were told we could have dinner 'on the hotel' - not great when you've just eaten! Within 15 minutes the room was miraculously ready. We unpacked and settled for an 'early' night. I agree with other travellers that the hotel was extremely busy with young students. We were on the 19th floor (of 20) and was woken every night with returning guests shouting loudly at 2am in the morning. This isn't what I would have expected from a hotel of this standing and didn't make for a good night's sleep. Having said that the room was clean, the bed clean and bathroom adequate (towels were far too small though). There was plenty of hanging space but no drawers in 2 of the rooms to unpack clothing that didn't need hanging. This is the 3rd time we've been to New York and the Sheraton is by far the best location we've stayed in - it is literally a couple of minutes walk from Times Square. On checking out (which is by 12 noon) we asked where we could leave our luggage as we were flying back to the UK overnight. We were informed the hotel contracts this service out and that it would be $3.25 per item. With 10 items between us (including hand luggage)this was outrageous. I went to the front desk and eventually was given a ticket waiving the charge. The queue to check in on our departure must have been 50 people long - I'm assuming because it was Good Friday but that would have involved a very long wait. Overall the hotel was clean and a great location but the students staying there didn't make it as enjoyable a stay as it should have been.

This is a very busy conference center and the priority of the hotel management and staff is to serve the interests of the agencies holding conferences at this hotel. My wife and I did not have a good experience here. Our trip unfolded like this: Night 1 - Checked in at night after a long flight from Seattle. Woke up at 7am the next morning to the loud noises of construction in the NEXT ROOM. Sheraton did not leave any buffer between our room and the area of active construction. When I called this in, the agent reluctantly agreed to move us to an unrenovated room 10 floors down as this was all that was available. She sounded annoyed that we were not already aware construction would be taking place and did not apologize for the inconvenience. Nights 2-5- A large conference of college students was staying at the hotel for the week (many were staying on our floor). This group would party until 2am in the morning every night. Not wanting to sound like a chronic complainer, we let it go the first night and just bought earplugs. On the second night of this, we called it in to security. After a while it did stop, but we were forced to call security every night after this to complain. Security would tell them to shut it down but it would take several calls until this actually happened. The walls in this hotel are so thin that we could literally hear every word somebody was saying when they were standing in the hallway (including the discussions that security had with the noisy tenants). The noisy tenants were never evicted or moved despite the complaints the we (and probably others) made. Nights 6-7 - College students leave. A group of new college students move in and the noise continues (albeit to a lesser degree) I am not one to harshly criticize others or set unrealistic expectations when I travel - but this was a bit ridiculous. As a result of the continued noise and disruption, we were tired every morning and this had a negative impact on our enjoyment of the trip. When I did finally complained to management about noise level, they offered a $100 credit to the room which we graciously accepted. Unfortunalty when we tried to use the restaurant, this too was closed for renos (as was the gift shop each time we tried to go). We complained to Expedia.ca in an attempt to be compensated through them, they told us that they are only the \"middleman\" and that we need to go through the hotel. They agreed to act on our behalf and actually called the hotel, but they could not get anything better than the $100 credit. Unless you are 18-25 years old and looking for a place to party without consequences in an expensive mid-town NYC hotel, I don't recommend staying at this hotel for the following reasons: - Excessive noise and poor noise buffer system (note that most of this hotels windows are single pain so you will get the added joy of hearing street noise in addition to other residents). - Rude / inconsiderate staff - Tendency for large groups of \"party age\" students to attend conferences here - Practice of demonstrating favoritism towards conference attendees over other guests.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond", "Title": "\u201cStill a Good Location- But Be Prepared\u201d", "Author": "FlyRight", "ReviewID": "UR105202858", "Content": "This hotel could not really have a more central location.

At times we saw a hundred people in line just to check-in. While we were there a huge group of college students were there. On the last two nights they partied until I had to go to security at 12:30 am, and they were at it again the next night. The rooms are small, but that is probably fairly normal for NYC. The housekeeping in the rooms was good, but I swear they never vacuumed the hallways. Overall, this hotel is certainly worth considering and will suite a family looking for decent rooms and a great location.

I was really impressed with the room, clearly it was new, it was quite spacious for NYC (big chair and little table, 2 double beds with side table, as well as small chest under the on-wall TV. The bathroom was disproportionately small, but it was okay. The bathtub was a bit odd though, it was extremely low. We only took showers, but still, I can't imagine that anyone would be able to take a bath in there. The closet was large with a big safe, and as always, the bed was very comfortable. There was a mini-bar with everything weighted so if you pick it up, you've bought it. So overall in the room, I was very impressed, especially for NYC, but I think the fact that we were in a renovated room made a difference. Since we're platinum, we got the upgrade, free internet and then we also got the club level amenities, which included afternoon hor dourves and breakfast in the morning. I was only able to go for breakfast, and while it's in a temporary location (in the lobby), for it being free, I was pretty impressed. It wasn't eggs and bacon, but instead cold cereal, oatmeal, bagels/bread/pastries, hard boiled eggs, fresh fruit, etc. Plenty of choices to fill up before the day. The melon they used wasn't quite ripe, but everything looked really fresh so that was a plus. The concierge was very helpful to my mom who was sightseeing during the day. The location really can't be beat, close to several subway stations, walking distance to central park, all the broadway shows, midtown shopping and much more. My mom and I only took the subway when we went down to soho or out to brooklyn. It really made a difference to our stay to be so central. One slight complaint was the cleaning lady for our room. The first day we got back and there was a pillow case or sheet or something that she had left on the mini-bar. Just made it seem like she hadn't finished cleaning or something. She also took my mom's unopened banana and threw it away which seemed odd. In general, I would definitely stay here again, especially if I can guarantee a renovated room.

Corporate Customer Service, P.O. Box 6020, Lancaster, CA 93539 Subject: Stay at Sheraton New York From Nov 24th Thru 28th Dear sir or Madam; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sitting here in room 2111, looking at a large black stain in the carpet at the foot of the bed and wondering what happened to Sheraton Hotels? Last Christmas our children gave us a trip to New York City to watch Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving Day Parade (on my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bucket list), which included 4 nights, Plane fare, limousine to/from JFK and tickets for the Rockets. We were excited. Arriving the day before, we checked in around 3PM. The staff was courteous, the lobby looked neat and clean as an upper class hotel chain should and the Bellman took our bags up to room 2103. The first thing we did was look out the window to see the vantage point we had to watch the parade, in case of inclement weather. Much to our surprise, the window was covered in translucent film. I called the front desk and expressed my displeasure with the room. Having been told that the film was there to protect the window during renovation, we requested another room and were promptly escorted to room 2111 down the hall. Obviously, we looked out the 21st floor window toward 7th Ave. and decided that inclement weather or not, it was not a good vantage point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sigh. The temperature outside was windy and in the 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and we could feel a slight breeze coming from the windows and attempted to adjust the room temperature. No matter what setting the thermostat was set at, the room temp remained the same \u00e2\u20ac\u201c chilly. We had to keep the curtains closed all of the time to minimize the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153window effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and let the shower run hot water to increase the humidity. We were disappointed that the room was not equipped with a small refrigerator, but had a self serve pay as you go version instead. Must be a Union requirement, since it has been hundreds of moons since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen one in any hotel in the US or anywhere else. However, we found that cans of pop, placed between the curtains and the window, was an adequate substitute. Things began to decay further. Tried the TV. For the first 20 channels all we saw was snow, which prevented us from watching the parade on TV even if we wanted to and none of the HD channels worked. But the movie selection channel worked just fine. Fancy that! I have to say that the room was anything but spacious. However, I suppose that back in the early 1900\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people were a lot smaller and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require much room. The furniture, if you could call it that, was tattered and beat, with the wall paper in the bathroom falling off of the wall. However, we made the best of probably the one of the worst and definitely, most expensive hotel rooms I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed at, eclipsed only by the Red Bank Hotel in New Jersey and the Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, which they closed while I was staying there!!!

However, upon returning from an early dinner at 7:30pm, I could hear non-stop hammering and drilling, as if it was in the room next door. I called the front desk and inquired about it. They told me they were doing construction in the hotel and that it would stop at 9pm. I wasn't excited about spending the next hour and a half listening to this, but I patiently waited. 9pm came. The drilling and hammering didn't stop. I called again at 9:15pm. This time I was told the construction would continue until 10pm. At 9:45pm, I called and asked to speak to a manager. I got the manager, Kenny, on the line and he told me it was supposed to end at 9pm and that he would personally go check on it. The drilling and hammering continues. 10:15pm, it is still going on. I call Kenny again. He tells me \"the foreman is incompetent\" and that they won't stop. I tell him I have a 4am wake-up call and that construction noise was not something the front desk people told me about when I checked in. He said \"yeah.\" I inquired if other guests were complaining, he told me they were but assured me \"the foreman is supposed to stop\". I assured him that the drilling and hammering was still continuing. He said he would call them again. 10:45pm. Construction noise is still happening. I call Kenny. He offers to move my room. Really? At 10:45pm when I'm in bed and have been trying to sleep for almost 2 hours?

Our arrival was nothing special, there was something which preplexed our agent and the ensuing silence was ackward. Upon resolution, I tried to bantor up a bit but the response was flat and offered nothing about our upcoming experience, facility or expectations. In most cases, this would be acceptable but it being the largest Sheraton in Manhattan one would expect something. We were wished a fond farewell and good stay though. The room was small. The heat was horrible, when checking it was turned up to maximum and it was WARMER in the Guest Hallway than in our room throughout our stay. There was a lightbulb out on the work desk opening the door to contact Guest Services for both issues which we promptly did within minutes of our entry. We lingered for 45 minutes and went to dinner. The lightbulb was replaced upon our return and later upon retiring for the evening we made the foolish mistake of selecting the bed closest to the window. Needless to stay the other two nights, we selected the bed closest to the warmth of the guest hallway. This could have been overlooked but our saga continued upon return from the first day, we were greeted with a notice from hotel management indicating due to the blizzard many hotel employees could not make it into work therefore this day services were restricted to towel replenishment. Now this is all well and good, an extraordinary condition leading to a well worded communication appealing sensibility of the weather BUT there was no gesture from hotel management to compensate inconvenience. There was a Starbucks in the Main Lobby certainly they could have bought us a cup of coffee or offered a movie or knocked $25.00 off the room. Now I imagine if someone were to raise this concern over their front desk or yet to their home office a plethera of compensation and remorse would have ensued but the point is whilst the experience is ongoing accommodate and treat your guests rather than just excuse yourself. Added on to this the inroom television had its' volume capped off too low making your decision as to either watching and hearing your selection from the corner of your bed or actually laying back in a rested position but not hearing your selection. While hotel management's action may be thoughtful of the entire guest population, the volume setting never exceed 34 out of 100 which is unacceptable. Certainly, the guest did not designed the soundproofing proffered by the building. This condition just aggravated me throughout the three days. The bathroom was tiny and the amenities were nice but their packaging was this kichy no frills knock off and totally missed my target of a big city hotel experience. The guest hallway, which was earlier cited as being a source of warmth, was not cleaned either promptly or regularly throughout the three days. While it is understandable through the blizzard condition ... when I state not cleaned I mean there were shoe boxes outside doors which sat for 2 days now any hotel team member could have simply passed by picked them up and moved them into a behind the scenes area to maintain the Sheraton reputation. Only on departure day, did I notice the hallway had been vacuumed. I give them props for the Starbucks which was quick and efficient each day. The Lobby was very nice and always full. The front steps were cleared of snow promptly.

The room was prepaid through h*twire (which I booked for them using his credit card). The day after their stay he noticed a charge for $168 on his credit card by Sheraton. He called and was told a monetary hold was put on his card for that amount in case of any incidentals and that they would credit him in a few days. (Which they did.) But when he checked in he was never told there was going to be a hold put on his card. I'm sorry, this is unacceptable. 1. It is unethical and unprofessional to put a hold on someone's credit card without informing them. You want to lose customers? I am a Starwoods preferred guest and you just lost me. 2. I wonder if the Sheraton did this because the young man is 24 and clearly from out of town? I have stayed at Sheraton on h*twire and pr*celine bids before and this has never happened to me.

Even on the coldest setting the air came out very warm, and even after I turned it off the room stayed overly warm. The next night I solved this by opening the blinds, which cooled the room off quite a bit because the windows apparently don't insulate very well. Pros - Clean comfy beds, shower and location.

Other trips have been good but it seems the hotel is either getting ready to close or embark on a major renovation (hope this is case). Our room was clean and bed very comfortable but it was impossible to control the heat - room was oven-like. Opened window which helped a bit but the heat made for bad sleeping. No washclothes in room and the very pleasant housekeepper apologized that they were in short supply. She did get us 2 on day 3 of trip. No hotel information book in the room - maybe eliminated for another source but don't know what that could be. Shower either very hot or cold - could not find that medium point. Sink drained slowly. Hair dryer old and died after 5 minutes use this morning. And could the towels please be improved? They are like sandpaper. Room layout could be improved by removing the long, long desk (which I read is going to happen), put the flat screen tv on the wall, add a comfortable chair. Elevators a major issue. On our floor, 23, at least one, usually 2 of the 3 elevators were not operating. We had a long conversation with the repair engineer this morning waiting to get on an elevator. Sounds like he is there practically 24 x 7! Got on an elevator going up so we could get to the lobby BUT the doors wouldn't open once we got there! With eight people in the elevator it got warm quickly but we could hear the (same) mechanic outside trying to get the doors open. While waiting we heard several stories about non-working toilets, cold food delivered via room service and hot hot rooms (like ours). No one seemed happy with their stay. Last year they opened their renovated bar area to include an internet / pc area. What a mess! Impossible to get seats in the bar and have a glass of wine. Place is crazy with kids and people wandering around trying to find seats. Plenty of floor space - could add more tables and chairs. The wine list has been dumbed down - very few interesting options offered by the glass. In the mornings this is a temporary Starbucks - service okay, but water never hot enough - multiple requests to get HOT water for tea.

Reason for picking sheraton was primarily location - our friends had never been to NYC - but we also had a corporate rate which sealed the deal. Service was generally good. Got in early and left bags with bellman - they had a room FULL of them, which made us fearful of check-in - however, when we returned from a walk in central park and lunch in the oak bar (around 4) there was nobody at registration and the bags were brought to our rooms within 5 minutes. Rooms were small and plain but perfectly practical for our purposes - sleeping, changing, showering, and that's about it. Room was small and a bit chilly (very windy outside) but we slept well. No sign of begbugs (we lifted the sheets, took out pillows, etc) and had no bites. weird thing - there were five or six housecleaning carts left in the hall outside our room around the clock. Not pretty to look at but at least we never worried about having clean glasses. had a bit of a view but from a 7th floor in Manhattan it wasn't a priority - if you want to see the city, get out and look up. amenities - didn't use fitness room or room service but bar service was fine (albeit drafty when the wind blew through the doorways). Fantastic location for seeing midtown - within 10 minutes you can walk to columbus circle, times square, central park, rockefeller, etc. Lots of cabs available on 7th for going anywhere further, though a bit of a wait around dinnertime. Food wise - there's good street breakfast cart one block south at 52nd for coffee and egg on a bun ($5), and bistro maison had nice breakfast and great (complimentary!!) beignets (53rd and 7th, kitty corner to hotel). For a great dinner try A Voce in Time Warner center at Columbus circle. Tough to get a reservation (and you may have to wait even if you have one, as we did), but unique and fantastic italian food at a reasonable (for NY) price, and wonderful sommelier hit our wine request right on the nose. Most of the people there were local. non-lesiure travel: if you are a business traveller and have to spread out a computer and work in the room i may feel it a bit cramped, but for the price we paid (especially compared to what we have paid for previous December stays at Bryant Park, Hudson, Shoreham and Sofitel) we feel we got fair value.

The room itself was clean, although the carpet could stand to be replaced and the bathrooms are ridiculously tiny. The night was the worst, however, because we could hear everything in the hall, including the group of drunk/angry/whatever women who periodically would come out into the hall, shouting at one another drunkenly, only to slam their door again....this continued until about 3 a.m. Trash had been left in the hallway (a McDonald's bag with french fries strewn about) and, seriously, with all the noise and shouting and drunkenness in the hall, I felt like I was in a ghetto.

This was our first time in NY and we were just steps away from Times Square. The hotel is very busy with lots always going on downstairs.

I think when we were there it was a wedding or some type of banquet going on as well as a few conferences. Rooms are small but nothing to complain about....it's NY. We spent all of a few hours a day in there. The rooms are nicely appointed though. In addition when I was checking in, the desk clerk told me that they were in the midst of renovating floor by floor so prices would probably be increasing around December as the entire building was getting a makeover. Carpets in halls, and things like that could use updating and I guess that is why they are updating. I would stay here again in a minute. A closer hotel is Marriott NY Marquis but this is just as close to Time Square. I think 53 and 7th ave and time square is around 48th and 7th or something like that. All of it is so close. I would recommend in a heartbeat. Rates fluctuate depending on the time of year. We went in July and rates were a bit lower. You can check out and leave bags if you want to sightsee some more. We did that but they charge $3 per bag left. Worth it if you have a late flight though so you can take in a few more sights. We used the NY Sightseeing Tours and I would recommend them. Most of the tour guides were nice and knowledgable. Tour package was about 50 pp and it inlcuded Statute of Liberty cruise, night tour of brooklyn and hop on and hop off day tours for length of our trip. Well worth it.

The fan was set to an air-conditioning mode, and the room got ridiculously cold; I couldn't adjust the thermostat upward, so I finally just shut it off. Room was fine after that. One unpleasant surprise was discovering that I was charged $2.29 for every 1-800 call I placed to the office. There was no notice in the room or on the phone that I'd be charged that kind of ridiculous fee for a call. The hotel breakfast at the \"Hudson Market\" is also ridiculously priced at $20 and upward. Fortunately, you can grab something outside the hotel for much less.

The driver was very friendly, chatty and helpful, (i did feel intimidated tho and very stupid for not checking him out properly) He dropped us to the side of the hotel, charging us 90 dollars plus tips! i then found out that the reason he dropped us round the side is because he is what they call a 'black cab' charging double the going rate! i felt like we had been robbed!! the two other men were also victims! the hotel rooms were very tiny, ok if you dont spend any time there, we were warned not to use anything from the fridge as it was very expensive.

As an SPG Gold member, I have never experienced this before and I will never return to this hotel. My room was not ready at 4pm, so I dropped off my luggage (which I had to pay for) and went to dinner. After dinner I called the hotel numerous times to check on the status of my room, and the phone was never answered. Around 6pm, I went back to the hotel and told them about the issue with the phone to which the guy at the desk replied: \"Sorry we were busy.\" I was also denied club floor priveleges, and late check out (supposedly only for platinum members at this hotel, but I have never been denied at any other Starwood hotel in NYC or any other city) After complaining to the manager of the hotel (A tall African American woman) who was friendly but only said \"sorry\" for everything and offered to cancel my room without charge. Sure, thats awesome. After 3 hours of waiting and paying to store my luggage, please let me cancel my reservation and haul my stuff to another part of the city. After finally getting to the room and getting my stuff situated I went to turn the heat down because it was blasting and very hot in the room. I discovered that I could not turn the heat off and tried calling the front desk. Again, no answer. Tried again....still no answer. So I walked downstairs and upon stepping off the elevator was told to go back to my room and put shoes on. Yes, I should have had shoes on but at this point I am furious and just want the heat turned off in my room. There were 3 people in line at the desk, so why is the phone not being answered?! The solution to the heat situation? \"Open the window\" Apparently because it is winter in NY, the heat needs to be blasting throughout the rooms so that it is around 85 degrees. So, I ended up sleeping with the heat blasting on me, a cold draft from the other end and a bunch of loud horns and traffic sounds because I had to sleep with the windows open in Midtown Manhattan. If this were my only experience at a Sheraton, I would NEVER stay at another one again, but I do understand that this is the exception and most of them are just fine.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close enough to easily walk to lots of attractions, but far enough away that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly quiet. The beds at Sheraton hotels are always the high point, extremely comfortable. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about where it ends. My room was extremely small, almost claustrophic, and both the main room and bathroom smelled like mold. There was literally no place to sit other than the bed. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Motel 6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type A/C unit by the window (no central air) never worked properly and the room was extremely cold despite it being August. I asked for a space heater but was told they were unavailable. Maid service was adequate although there were hairs in the shower (before I used it) and the maid did not replenish the supplies in the room (i.e. coffee, notepads). Internet service in the room was extremely slow, and I never could get the wireless to work. My wake-up call was 15 minutes late. There was no information in the room about the hotel, map, how to get around, information about New York, room service, nothing! The staff is another story. The concierge gave me wrong directions to a store I asked about and I wandered around until I found it \u00e2\u20ac\u201cabout three blocks away from where he said it would be. Upon checkout, I asked the front desk attendant for some change. She needed to go to the back and was gone for some time. Upon returning, she was licking her lips and announced to her co-worker that she had been in the back having a snack. I guess taking a snack break was more important than serving a waiting customer. The luggage check attendant was very unpleasant to everyone and they charged $3.25 a bag to store your luggage. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never heard of such a thing, and you can imagine how expensive this could get for a family traveling with a lot of bags. Upon the conclusion of the conference, as everyone was leaving, there was a long line and only one person working the desk to retrieve luggage. At a hotel of this size, they should be better staffed.

The next day, when venturing out for another walk, discovered it again a few blocks east....The food was great (tried the spicy italian sausage, mozzarella sticks, and fries....all good...they also had deep fried Oreos but we weren't brave enough) and the wares on sale were nice...anything from hundreds of styles of NYC baseball caps to pearl necklaces, to pashminas, to socks, to t-shirts....the list was endless. 5th ave was just 2 blocks east for your normal retail shopping...from Abercrombie to LV....all your shopping needs....Rockefeller was also just a few blocks away, along with Radio City Music Hall and Magnolia (a famous cupcake place) were also with 5-10 minutes....about 10 minutes north was Central Park....

Having spent one long weekend here, the hotel served its purpose well and provided us with a fairly comfortable stay in a convenient location. It is worth noting that two of the more redeeming features of the hotel are its price value and location. Given the high cost of most New York hotels, we found the Sheraton offered something approaching reasonable rates. More importantly perhaps, it is situated just outside of central Manhattan, and we found that we were usually within walking distance of almost anywhere we wanted to go, be it 5th Avenue or Times Square.

The location was excellent, right in midtown manhattan with easy access to transportation (several train lines were within a 2 block walk).

Lots of local attractions were a short walk, cab or train ride away (several museums, Rockefeller Center, the Letterman Show, Empire State Building, etc.) as well as several places to eat (Applebee's was delicious!!!)

The staff was very courteous and helpful...from the bellhop who helped us unload at the curb, to the reception desk who got us in quickly, to the staff bringing us extra blankets or coming up to unlock a door. The concierge service was great as well. They knew their stuff and explained everything very nicely. The hotel itself was very nice. The lobby was very welcoming and luxurious and our rooms were roomy. We had 2 adults and 6 kids (teens as well as young kids) and everyone was able to get a good nights rest. We had a suite which included a \"living room\" with a Murphy Bed and a bed room with two double beds. The views from the hotel room were very good, looking up and down 7th Ave. towards Times Square and Central Park. A couple of opportunities were parking and a swimming pool. The parking was not at the hotel. Instead, I had to drive (only about a 30 second drive) to a parking facility around the corner. The rate is for the day and you can't take your car in & out...which was fine by me. Just being able to park somewhere and not have to worry about your vehicle is a great benefit. A pool in the hotel would've been nice as well, but you don't always get it all. I was informed there is a pool in the hotel across the street (owned by the same company), but we were usually too tired by the time we got back to the room to go over there.

The room was of a decent size (though not huge as i expected it to be in US) and very clean.

The lobby was very busy but the lifts were well divided between floors and so it was never a hassle to travel by the same. The breakfast was nice with some lovely fresh strawberries. In the evening free snacks were served to the people staying in club rooms which was very nice. Having a seperate lounge for breakfast for club members was again very good as it saved you lots of time in the morning as getting a seat is real difficult as this hotel is very busy at all times of the day. The bathroom also is of a decent size with toileteries provided and hot water at all times. The reason for it being busy at all times is its wonderful location. Just a short walk away from times square, fifth avenue and many other places worth watching, all located at a walking distance and many restaurants also close to the hotel.

Really, I can't fault the hotel for the overstay of guests, and they did everything they could to get me in to my room in a timely manner. The room itself was very clean, as was the bathroom (though dated.) The work area, TV, bed, etc. were all in excellent condition, and the ironing board and iron looked new (for me, I NEED those to be good.) The lobby, elevators, halls and everything else was quite nice, and all in all, for an older hotel I really ended up enjoying my stay. Zoe's call made the difference, because at least they cared enough to call and offer to make it right. In the past ten years I have spent MANY night away from home, so my hotel reviews tend to be a little more personal. While I normally stay at Marriott or Hilton, this Sheraton property was really quite nice, and I will come back here again. The location...superb. The rooms are comfortable and quiet with very little street noise. The ONLY thing that causes me to give the rooms a 4 out of 5 is because the bathrooms are dated. However, clean is more important to me, and in this economy, I can't expect them to spend money on something that isn't broken if I am being realistic. I would highly recommend this property to anyone, and I am looking forward to coming back.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "east northport", "Title": "\u201cA lovely way to spend an anniversary\u201d", "Author": "sharonls57", "ReviewID": "UR71022759", "Content": "We had the opportunity to spend an day and night in NYC to celebrate our 25th anniversary.The people and the amenities at the Sheraton were wonderful.

A sign would have been helpful. I then had to queue at reception behind a 747 load of Air China cabin crew before someone could tell me where a pharmacy was.

The desk lamp was broken, office chair should have been thrown out, the blinds didnt work properly, the bed head was broken. Half the minibar items with dates, were 6 months out of date. Even in the lifts there was a sign that was old and half falling off.

Itt was FAR FAR superior to this rated 4 star hotel. 4 stars for this hotel is laughable, I'd be nice to call it 3, but I've stayed in some 2 that were close. I'm fine with funky dated decor, but not old and dirty. Carpets make you trip because they're buckled, it's bad. We had a fabulous location, and were excited to get to our rooms. We had booked and prepaid for 2 rooms. Prepay, get a \"special\" at $240 a night, big mistake. Prepay means no refund, and no desire to give you good service should you have a concern or complaint. Our main complaint, we had 3 people staying in one of the rooms. None of which were dating or married to each other, and 2 double sized beds (hotel claimed not to have any queens available even though we booked on the Hotels own website 6 months in advanced and requested as such, and the whole hotel had no King beds at all. We couldnt even order up a roll-away bed because the room was way way too small. Upon requesting to change rooms, we were denied, with No apology. There was no accomodation for their room size being too small, no refund, tough patootie. There was merely walking space around the two double beds, and that is being gracious. The walls were super thin, and I dont mean if the neighbors got loud, I mean I could hear them having normal un-animated conversation well past midnight. I could hear their showers start, I could tell you what their conversation was about! It was shockingly bad how not-sound-proof this place was. There were no fans in the bathroom at all. So, you get in, you shower, it gets hot, too darn bad. Cant open the door to cool off cause you're in a room with non-relatives. LOL ALL of the food in the mini-bar refridgerator and food drawer were outdated by several months. Also, the fridge was completely stashed with this outdated food, there wasnt a single space for you to bring back leftovers or even stash your own water bottle. The large screen tv were nice. The gym looked nice. The location is perfectly ideal for the theater lover, couldnt be closer, Times Square is in your backyard, and nicely walking distance and centrally loacted to Central Park, 5th Avenue and great subway intersections. I'd definitely search this neighborhood again for another hotel, even the 3 star Sheraton Manhattan looked superior, and friends that stayed there liked it better. I'm heading back to the Hilton.

What was most scary about this place was the overall lack of security especially at 1-2am when no security people were at the elevator entry areas. I did really like the club level and the breakfast is fun and coffee nice along with the overall environment. The bar at the club was missing the martini stirrer and didn't have absolute vodka, a women next to said its always like that here. But lets start at the beginning, we arrive late its 85 degrees and humid as we enter our stuffy room on the floor twenty and the air conditioner doesn't work. I call down to the desk and they say they will send up maintenance, thirty minutes pass no one arrives. We pack up our stuff and head down to the front desk this time pissed off. We ask for another room and I complain about the room assignment, the front desk attendant says \"what do you expect me to check out every room to see if the air conditioner works?\" I ask for a manager and he is even ruder, and guess what I am a ten year starwood member and our company recommends this hotel, I remind him of that they don't care. But they assign me a room above the club level, make sense? I don't think so the next day I ask for the day manager, Zoe Cohen and she is nice and gives me 12,000 starwood points. Two days later it is raining and we attempt to go out for dinner, the cab line is long and the bell captain is no where to be found, so I jump the line and get my own cab. The next morning we leave at 5:45 am and guess what there is no bell person to help with anything. What is up with this? Overall a great location, and it is unfortunate that all our European visitors are treated to the same level of poor service. I noticed many Italians during my two visits. The good news is our maid service was very good, but I don't think I will stay here again, because as a Starwood member I expected my room to be ready at 1AM.

I requested English Breakfast Tea-bags and they made a note of this but these never appeared. They only provided one small packet of \"creamer\" with each coffee or teabag, which tasted ghastly! The breakfast was expensive, but for a treat, well worth it - there was so much of everything, from fresh fruits, cereals, porridge, yoghurts, meats and cheeses, to bacon, eggs and sausages. They even had yoghurt coated raisins and mousses and smoothies that you could help yourself to. The Fitness Centre was, according to our sons, the best they'd ever been to. It cost $20 per person for the whole week, so it didn't break the bank. They used it every day. Apparently, we were allowed the use of a swimming pool at another hotel nearby. One day we started eating some dried fruit & nuts from the mini-bar and they tasted odd. On checking the pack we found it to be months out of date and we complained to the Manager. He was very apologetic and gave us a voucher for 4 free drinks at the bar. I thought this would be the end to it, but the following evening we also had some chocolate from the mini-bar and began eating it. Again it tasted funny and this also was months out of date! I couldn't believe this would happen again, as we'd only just complained the day before and I presumed someone would have checked our mini-bar to ensure this wouldn't re-occur. We checked the rest of the items in the fridge and drawer and so did our two sons who were in a different room - most of the items in both mini-bars were out of date! The Manager again apologised and stated that the stocking of the mini-bars was run by a separate company. This should not be an excuse because at the end of the day it's the responsibility of the Sheraton to see that everything is of top quality and in date.

Every room I stayed in at Sheraton New York was outstanding! From the spacious size room, super comfortable room, personal touches such as a bathrobe and vanity items. When i stayed for 4 weeks straight I was given extra hangers to accommodate all my clothes. Having a gym on site for working out stress after a long day of work and some personal sight seeing was great. Sheraton New York is very centrally located, just blocks from Central Park, Rockefeller Center and Times Square. The staff were always very helpful, courteous and took care of me very well. When my flight home after my 4 week stay was cancelled due to weather, they got me a room at a moments notice and were the only bright spot in an otherwise troublesome day. My co-worker loved her stay as well and decided that the small boutique hotels could not compare to all you get with Sheraton.

We arrived on Thursday and checked out Sunday morning. First of all, I would like to begin by saying that this hotel's location is absolutely perfect, Times Square is a couple of blocks away, 5th Avenue for shopping is only a short walk away as is Central Park. The location is perfect for first time or repeat visitors who want to be right in the middle of the action. With that said, I have stayed at many other Starwood properties, including Sheraton, and the hotel itself was a little disappointing. First of all, minus the lobby, which is quite nice and clean and spacious, the rest of the hotel is tired-looking and dated. The rooms are quite small when compared to their other Sheraton properties. The carpet certainly looked tired and worn and in need of replacing. The room and bathroom were clean and kept that way for our stay. Our first night was on the 45th floor, Club Level, and we quickly realized that the walls were paper thin. No joke. We had rambunctious neighbours, who had loud music playing to the point where I could hear the words and we could hear their (loud) conversation. After a long day of traveling, this was unacceptable. After a call to the front desk, security paid them a visit and they kept relatively quiet. Some hours later we were woken up with the loud music and loud voices once again. Another call to security, but they merely turned down the music a little and kept with their loud conversations. My dealings with security were very pleasant, they were apologetic and did show up at the room within 15 minutes. The next day we inquired and found out they weren't checking out for 3 more days, so we requested a room change. The staff was quite accommodating and apologetic and moved us to the 50th floor, still Club Level. Our room was the same, seemed to be a little smaller, but it was blissfully quiet, so we didn't mind. We ate breakfast the first morning in the Club Lounge on the 44th floor. They had an OK spread of bagels, toast, yogurt, fruit, Starbucks tea and coffee etc. It was a continental-type breakfast spread. Again, I have stayed at other Sheraton properties in the US and they have had a much larger spread, including bacon, eggs, sausage etc. It served the purpose for us that day and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We only wish that this had been open on the weekends as it would have been nice to have breakfast before leaving the hotel and it would have saved us some money. I had another room booked for Saturday night only for a guest that was joining us. I was out for the day on Saturday and got back around 4, went to check in the second room and, of course, with the hotel being booked up, there were limited King rooms avail. The first I was given on the 30th-odd floor absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke. This being a smoke-free hotel and the fact that I suffer from smoke sensitivities, made this unacceptable. I went back to the reception and requested another room, this time we were given an accessible room, therefore it was quite large and located on a quiet floor. No noise issues. Having to run around, change rooms multiple times, unpack and repack made this visit somewhat stressful and less enjoyable. With that said, every staff member I encountered at the hotel was wonderful, very apologetic and helpful.

It's also on top of a Subway stop and within 10-15 minutes walking distance from the Port Authority bus terminal (airport shuttles, etc.). The lobby is very nice and inviting, with lots of seating. The staff was helpful and efficient in person, but it was difficult to reach them on the phone at times.

If you're arriving early and waiting to check in, they will store it for free (at least they did for us). Our room was surprisingly big for NYC, though we did have a handicapped-accessible room. The hallways and rooms could use some updating (especially the worn carpet). Everything was clean, and there was even a ~40 inch flat-screen TV in the room, but the decor and furniture were somewhat dated. If you're hoping to have views of the city and/or Central Park, you'll probably be disappointed. Even though the building is 50 stories tall, there are many other tall buildings around. Our advice: catch great views from Top of the Rock and/or the Empire State Building instead. Speaking of attractions, the admission costs can add up quickly in NYC. If you're visiting more than 3-4 major attractions, consider the New York CityPass, which offers a great value and (more importantly) the ability to bypass the long lines.

If I had room in my luggage I would love to take the bed , bedding and pillows home with me! Free wi-fi in the lobby and free use of computers at the Link in the lobby too. As a priority club member I enjoy the club floor - free breakfast and evening snacks. I highly recommend this to the business traveller as well as families travelling together. Have never had a bad experience at this wonderful hotel. This time we had trouble connecting to the internet in the room and they were so sorry that they sent up a tray with drinks and sweet treats to make up for the inconvenience. Hard to find that kind of customer service these days.

Staff was excellent, especially when we got home to Pa and my husband discovered that he left his laptop and money in the room safe. We called the hotel and Sal in Security got the combo from my husband and said he would call back in 10 minutes which he did. He said he was securing the items in their safe. He offered to send it FedEx, but since the laptop contained all of our personal and company business he told Sal I would make the return trip the next day to personally pick it up. Fren and Kevin, who I believe was head of security were there when I arrived and were most helpful.

I had not stayed at the Sheraton New York in about 6 years, and my recollection was that it was an average, serviceable hotel. In my opinion, this property has gone way downhill. I do not plan to return to this hotel. The late night check in staff person appeared to be upset that she was working there. Never said hello, just \"next\". I had specifically reserved (and paid extra for) a club floor room and was told at check in that I there were no such rooms available. No apology given or offer to try to make it right. She just said that that February was the \"slow season\" and so they were giving the club floor rooms a \"deep clean.\" When I asked her why they advertised and sold club floor rooms on their reservations website if they already had planned that they would be unavailable, she just looked at me and repeated that they were getting a deep clean. She basically gave me the \"ask me if I care\" look. Putting aside the indifferent (and unhappy) front staff, the housekeeping and maintenance of the rooms are very, very poor. The room I was given was seriously disgusting. You can see from the attached photos I took with my camera phone the state of the room. The first thing I noticed was the partially digested candy on the floor next to the seat. Upon closer inspection it appeared to be a wintergreen certs that the prior guest had spit out on the floor (you can judge for yourself from the photo). Next to the bed nightstand was a rolled up piece of tissue on the ground (see also photo). As you can also see from the attached photo, the ceiling above the bed was cracked and peeling. Moreover the only accessible power outlet (near the bed) did not work and was pulled out about an inch from the wall. You can't see it from the photo, but there is exposed wiring on the back of the outlet plate that would be dangerous if you had a kid in the room. Numerous black scoff marks also all along the walls of the bedroom. Also, the room size itself is on the smaller size, even by NYC standards. But the bedroom was not the worst part. The bathroom was nasty and unsanitary. It had mold growing all over the shower. Don't take my word for it -- look at these photos. You can see from the attached photos that mold is growing in the tile grout, around the soap dish, and there are mold spots on the ceiling above the shower. Really, pretty gross, and I ended up not using the shower because of that. The management at this hotel is obviously dropping the ball on maintenance and housekeeping. Pretty untypical for a Starwood hotel. I don't recommend this hotel. There are many other (and better) choices in the midtown Manhattan area in the same price range. All the hotels in the area are busy and see a large volume of traffic, that is not an excuse for shoddy quality and poor service.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "ericperera", "ReviewID": "UR58719450", "Content": "Comfy beds, friendly staff, great location.

There's no doubt that the hotel's location was the main reason we chose to stay there. Inspite of negative reviews that we have read about this hotel but location wise it was one of the most strategic hotel located near Times Square. Now, here comes the negatives about the hotel. First, it was the smallest hotel's room size I have ever been to. Secondly, it was not properly maintained and cleaned so I could easily find imperfect spots in our room. Third, lousy service, this was probably due to high season when we were there but definitely needed more staffing during the busy period. Fourth, limited facilities for such a five star hotel in New York such as no swimming pool in the hotel.

I immediately wrote the hotel to confirm that the hotel had been renovated, is smoke free, and meets the standards of the Sheraton brand. Along with confirming the quality of the hotel, I requested a king size bed and a room on a higher floor that is newly renovated floor (something that was recommended on Trip Advisor). I received an immediate response from Sharon the Director of Reservations. She assured me that I would have a great stay and confirmed a king size bed on a higher floor. I was nervous, but couldn't really do anything but wait. When we arrived in New York, I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Yes, the hotel is very big and busy, the room is a bit small, and the room is a bit worn because of all the people that go through. But let's be honest - it's a hotel in Manhattan! The bed was very comfortable and the room was decorated in a modern fashion. We also got complimentary breakfast on our floor which was delicious. Plus, the hotel is perfectly located in Midtown. I was nervous about the hotel but it all worked out beautifully.

Our holiday was just to see New York and get a little bit of shopping in. I had booked the holiday through Virgin holidays about 6 months ago, and about a month before i travelled i had emailed ahead to the hotel to request an early check in, as this is normally at 3pm but our flight meant we would be at the hotel for about 1pm. Got to the hotel and first impressions were great, the lobby is really big and looks very nice, there is a cafe selling starbucks coffee just to your left and also \"The Link\" which is free internet access for all guests. Before i had chance to get to reception the Bell cap was happy to take care of my bags until i had got checked in. Went to the front desk and advised i was checking in, i didnt mention i had emailed ahead, but it didnt matter as the lady checked me in straight away and asigned us a room on the 41st floor, i was over the moon with this as i had wanted a high room to get a good view. The bell cap took us to the elevator which was nice and fast and took less than 20 seconds to get us to our floor. The room was pretty small, but having being to New York before, i expected this, the rooms are always small unless you pay a silly amount and get a suite. The bathroom had plenty of towels and shampoo's etc, the shower was good too, nice and powerful and the heat was easy to adjust. There is an electronic safe in the closet but it needs to stay closed while not in use as if its left open for too long the code would reset it's self so you would need to keep doing this. The room had a double bed, but it was a big double and had plenty of room, mini bar and snack bar were located in the fridge and dresser and there is a nice 37\" HDTV on top which is on a swivel stand so that you can see it while laid in bed. The rooms were cleaned daily and you can chose how often you want your bed linnen and towels changing by placing the towels on the floor and placing the \"Time for a change\" card on the bed. There is an ice machine located on each floor as well so that you can fill up on this if you need it. All in all my stay at ther sheraton was brilliant, i would 100% go back here again, and would 100% recommend this hotel to my friends and family.

I was a bit worried after reading some of the negative reviews. Our experience was excellent. We used Priceline to get the room and were treated as well as any other guest. We were able to check in at 2:00 p.m. (could have checked in even earlier if we were willing to take 2 beds instead of the King we requested). They did NOT charge us to keep our bags, either before we checked in or after we checked out (we left them there on checkout day for several hours before heading to the airport). Our room was clean, well decorated and comfortable. Typical sized room for NYC. Pros: All of the staff was friendly, helpful and hardworking the entire time we were there. The cleaners were prompt, friendly and restocked our room with fresh towels and toiletries every day without being asked. The room was clean & well decorated. The location is outstanding! We had tickets to Mamma Mia at the Winter Garden theater and could see the theater from the front door of the hotel. There is a subway station right outside the door, directly across the street and several within 1/2 a block. All of the \"touristy\" locations are very close by, a quick walk in any direction will have you either in Central Park, Columbus Circle, the heart of Times Square and the theaters, MoMA, David Letterman, Radio City, Rockefeller Plaza, etc. Just 10 blocks from Penn Station if you need to catch a train to the airports, including Newark which is where we flew in/out of this time. Check-in was fast & efficient. Though wireless internet in your room isn't available, it's free in the lobby. I used my iPod to check email, map out our destinations on the MTA, etc. There are computers available for free in the lobby, but they're usually full. You can easily sit in the number of comfortable chairs and quickly log on for free with the hotel wireless. Wired high speed internet is available in your room for $15 a day but that's an expense I refuse to pay at ANY hotel :) You can also use a computer near the front desk to print out confirmations, boarding passes, etc. for free. We even printed my husband's pay stub because he forgot his employee ID needed to get into some museums for free through his employer. The elevators were fast and never crowded. We rarely had to wait more than 5 seconds for one and rarely had anyone else in the car with us though the hotel was very busy with lots of guests. Cons: The room is very hot. You can turn the fan off to the radiator, but can't turn off the heat. We found if we didn't turn the fan on at all, it wasn't unbearable. I usually like my rooms on the warm side but this was a little too much. Would have been nice to be able to vent the window a bit for fresh air. The doors appear to not seal properly so if people are being inconsiderate and talking loudly in the hallways, you can hear it as if they are in the room with you. This wasn't much of a problem, but I can see how it could be if there was a convention or group of some sort on the same floor. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this place. We travel to NYC frequently and have stayed in hotels all over the city and this one was just fine. Remember, you're there to experience the city, not complain about the towels being too rough or the room being too small.....think of it as a place to sleep and clean up and store your stuff and don't try to crowd too many people into one room and stop looking for things to complain about and you'll have a wonderful experience!", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeville HI", "Title": "\u201cVery well managed property\u201d", "Author": "HI_Rich", "ReviewID": "UR56877936", "Content": "I stay at this hotel very regularly.

We decided to give the room a chance since we were already there. When we got in the room, it was very small, one of the beds was leaning, and the bathroom was dirty. We ended up going to the Marriott and getting a room there. We were required to pay for one night stay at the Sheraton even though we didn't stay there.

It looked like they had a pretty spacious meeting/conference area, too. The downside of things were pretty minimal and were mainly a product of NYC consistently overcharging for EVERYTHING: 1. $3.50 to store your luggage? Really? That's just downright comical. 2. $10/day to use the gym? Okay, I guess I won't be using your gym anytime soon. 3. $15 to use the internet in your room? Free to use the public computers in the lobby? Hmmm...there's tough decision. 4. My toilet wouldn't stop running. I heard from others on my trip that they had the same problem. I went to the front desk who said they'd send someone up to fix it. Guess what never happened? So, I literally tried to fix this thing on my own. It wouldn't work because the toilet was broken. Had to shut the bathroom door while I slept so that the sound of the running toilet didn't keep me up.

We called the night before our arrival at this hotel to see if we could get an early check-in. After waiting on hold and listening to an annoying recording over and over, we were told in no uncertain terms, we could absolutely not check-in early; but they'd be willing to check our bags while they make ready our room; I would just need to pre-register. I arrived to find the lobby filled with lines. It was difficult to tell which one to get into, so I asked a bellman. He indicated which line was for registering, and I got in line. After a short while, I was at the desk with a reasonably nice young man. He promised I would not have to wait in the other long line to check my bags, that I could just drop them off with the bellman. The bellman, on the other hand, said that the longer line was indeed the line to drop bags off. We waited and made our way through the length of the lobby, around toward the ballrooms and finally to an elevator where another bellman took us down to another level and yet another line to wait in to check our bags. Finally, we checked our bags and could head out to explore the city. We returned well after the time our room was promised and found that pre-registering didn't really save us anything. We waited in the registration line again, and then waited in the line to pick up our bags. We headed to our room. I opened the door, expecting a couch, or at least an easy chair. The room had neither. The room was hot, so we attempted to turn on the AC, but that only made it hotter, so I called Guest Services. After several minutes of the same annoying recording, a live person finally answered and promised she would send up an engineer. The engineer came in and said the AC doesn't work in NYC in the winter, which was odd because the hotel I staying in a few blocks away the night before had a perfectly working AC. He offered to open a window, and when I mentioned the noise, he said, \"That's the way it is. It's New York City.\" Guest services called me back later to ask about the service I received from the \"engineer,\" and I advised them of my displeasure. They indicated they would have a manager call me. The call never came through. The next morning, I figured the least they could do is let us have a late check-out.

I have stayed at their family of hotels all around the world, and I really hate to say this was an experience that ranked at the bottom of my list for almost any hotel. The room was actually worse than rooms I have stayed at in two-star hotels, with a pedestal sink that was cracked or broken in a number of places. There is no air conditioning in the room AT ALL, and an old old heating system. I was able to slide open the window but then it came off track and couldn't be completely closed again and even in the midst of the blizzard the room was only tolerable. I was convinced that something must have gone wrong with my reservation since I am a Gold SPG member but when I went downstairs the desk assured me the room was standard. The sheets--itchy. The towels cheap. Even if it is an ideal location I still wouldn't give it more than 2.5 stars. The Westin, W, and another Sheraton are all within a few blocks. I can't imagine any of them being worse than this place. The service? Well we left a pair of shoes in the room and didn't discover it until we were in another city. We called for three days asking if they found them. Each time someone said they would look into it an call us back. No one ever did. Finally on the fourth day we insisted on talking to a manager. She was in a meeting, and when she called back, she clearly did not want to talk to us. She was curt, almost rude, and said she would look into it and call back. No such luck. She did have someone else call back who was even more rude, whosaid they had the shoes and needed a FedEx account number or a credit card so that we could pay to have them shipped back to us. If they had asked that during the first three days when we were looking for them that would have been great, but given the previous lack of customer service they could've at least have paid to send the shoes back. So in short, if you plan to stay at a Sheraton, pick one of the other ones nearby. Personally, I may just go back to Marriott when in New York. This isn't a complaint against Sheratons as a whole--I have stayed at two others this month as well and had a great time.

The day before we arrived, I called the front desk @ The Sheraton to mention our request for King beds and they said they would make a notation and every attempt to accomodate. The day of arrival, after the madness of trying to get into their parking garage, we checked in @ the desk and were told we could have an early check in if we would take 2 doubles or we could wander around for a couple of hours until 3pm to get in a king room. We decided to wait for the king, since we were 2 couples in each room and this was somewhat of a romantic holiday type get a way. I was very dissappointed when we arrived back @ 2:30pm-checked in, got to our adjoining rooms on the 8th floor and sure enough.....DOUBLE BEDS!!!! I called the front desk immediately and was treated as a special priceline customer ~got the response of \"Priceline does not guarantee bed availability or requests\" and \"we are sold out of king rooms\" YEAH! I know priceline does not make guarantees however was told at check in to walk around and come back for our KING BEDS! So, my hubby slept in 1 bed and I slept in the other with our 5 month old son.

I immediately called the front desk and their first response was \"did you move anything in there?\" LOL! They did correct this and we were not billed but this is ridiculous! The location was fantastic! We easily walked to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Central Park with our 5 month old in tow. There were plenty of good places to eat and shop.

The good: Decent beds and clean sheets and modern looking decor. And two phone lines, which came in handy. Relatively clean (no bed bugs, yay!) The bad: Never mind the \"Starwood\" label on anything associated with this hotel. These guys are here for one purpose and one purpose only - to make as much money from you as possible. Any difficulties were met with hostility from the staff starting with the fact that our entire stay was charged on the credit card when my friend placed the room on hold while we looked around about a month before our stay. When we tried to back out they said, \"Too bad, we charged it. Sure you can cancel, but you'll have to pay us $1,000.\" The supervisor didn't care. Sheraton corporate office didn't care either. This set the tone and unfortunately, Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers never bothered to make any other impression except that they would charge the heck out of you if you let your guard down. I wanted a newspaper but was told there are no newspapers on weekends. I wanted a free breakfast. I was informed that the deal my friend booked did not include any sort of continental breakfast yet it was $257/night not including the 30% NY taxes. I wanted to print out my boarding pass in the midst of the historic snowstorm that had messed up my flight. I asked the concierge for help - just a second or two. I was told to go downstairs to the business center and pay to use the internet. There were a few free terminals in the lobby, but they were hijaked by 10-year-olds playing computer games. The 1960s looking dials to the heater were hidden under a modern heating vent and I couldn't figure out how to turn on the heat. I woke up freezing and had to call the desk to ask. I was on hold for 20 minutes at 3 a.m. That's a long time when all you want to do is get a quick answer so you can go back to sleep. Turns out the room becomes either stiffling hot or freezing as the low-medium-high and hot-cold dials seem to be for decoration only. Very strange. The ugly: The hotel was originally built in the 1960s (I think) and though it initially looks decent, as you begin to hang out for a while you realize that it needs a major overhaul. The toilet flushed UPWARDS. Meaning that the water and anything else in the toilet came cascading skyward and onto a person prior to going down the toilet. I called twice on this and they didn't fix it. A call came in to find out if I was happy with the result of the repair. No, actually, I said, I am still getting crap blown into my face and on my jeans whenever I forget to close the lid before flushing. They sent a second guy up who told me it was a \"special toilet\" and I needed to \"flush it very, very slowly\" -- yeah, it's special because it's broken, thanks. They never followed up after that. My flight was cancelled and rebooked for seven days later. I needed to make some calls to try to get out of town sooner and was on the phones for 8-10 hours. All those 1-800 numbers had a charge associated with them. Ouch! The front desk took 50% of the charges off, but not without a fight. In fact, the supervisor laughed at me when I said I would write about how uncooperative they were on Tripadvisor. Very condescending of her. 1500 flights were cancelled and it was a special circumstance. I had hoped for a little compassion, but nope. I would not ever stay here again. I've lived in New York and stayed in hotels around the city for the past 5 years. This one is 50% more than what you'd pay in other really nice places that aren't smack in the middle of midtown.

(Mind you, we are in our late 20's and average or even below average for our size/build) What did this mean for us? There was absolutely no where to really store out luggage, let alone, open our bags or get ourselves ready. The website states the double bed room has a \"large work desks positioned with a view of the window\" but fails to mention that this desk will be the only place you will be able to store your luggage if there is more than one person in the room. Granted, were were not there for business, but if we were and wanted to use the desk, it would not have been possible; it was not even possible to move the chair around very much. Must pay for internet access. One of my pet peeves is a hotel that has a shower head that either do not have the right amount of water pressure or one that is clogged letting water come out every which way. This hotel definitely fit this bill. The good things about this hotel: the beds and pillows are nice; the lobby is beautiful; and the hotel is in a good location.

When you make a pre-paid reservation, it is NOT pre-paid. Per their policy, you have to pay around 86% of the total room rate for your stay a the time of booking. I made the silly assumption that they in fact did follow their policy, and went on to make other pre-paid reservations for other hotels, rental car, tours, etc. Come to find out, they don't get around to charging you until 2 days before you are to arrive, and for the total amount, not the 86%. This left me in NYC without a hotel and without extra money to pay for one, in December. I'm partly to blame for not checking, but my experience is not unique. The rest of my family also noted that they were charged 2 days before arrival. My \"Pre-Paid\" reservations were made 6 weeks in advance. Issue #2: The standard double room is so small, two suitcases is all you have room for, and the second one will have to go under the desk or in the bathtub. To contrast, the rooms at the Hilton across the street, for about the same price, could actually sleep 5-6 (if they'd let you), with luggage, and be comfortable. Issue # 3: The lobby is beautiful, however, the floor we were on was terrible. The carpet was ragged, with the seams coming apart, and bubling/uneven. The hallways were constantly littered with room service carts, often left for more than 24 hours. When we checked out, at around 10 am, there were 7 carts between us and the elevators, one cart had an open mustard bottle that had spilled all over the carpet. It had been spilled since at least 6 PM the night before, when I reported it to the front desk. We had to push trash out of the way to get our luggage through. It was a Sunday morning after a rainy Saturday, but still, it was disgusting.

I was a little worried about my niece and her girlfriend staying in New York. So, after reading the reviews of the hotel on Tripadvisor, I thought it would be a good idea to Email the hotel, before she arrived, to make sure she received a nice room with a view. Well, her one night stay was amazing from start to finish thanks to Jorge Guerrero, the Guest Service Manager at The Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers! I have never known anyone so dedicated to the service of others. First, she arrived before check-in and was greeted cheerfully by the staff and was allowed to check-in early and the attendant was very gracious. She was thrilled with her room which was a corner room on the 49th floor (#4904) and had a fabulous view of Central Park. The room was beautifully decorated, very clean with 2 wonderful comfortable beds and all the amenities. She called the front desk to inquire about the Club Level Lounge which features evening hors d'oeuvres. They told her that it was closed on weekends. Then, to her amazement, shortly after her call, Jorge Guerrero, sent up a beautiful bottle of white wine as well as a fruit/cheese tray and tray of chocolate-covered strawberries! Can you imagine this. WOW! Jorge Guerrero, has completely redefined the words 'customer service'. Jorge also provided her with his personal contact information and told her to call him if she needed anything. He really bent over backwards to make them feel welcome. I really appreciated the personal attention my niece received. They loved the location of the hotel which is on 7th Ave and 53rd. They walked to Times Square in 5 minutes...Rockefeller Center 5 minutes....5th Avenues stores...St. Patrick's Cathedral. Best possible location in Manhattan. Now everyone in my family wants to sign up for a Starwood Preferred Guest Credit card so that they can accumulate enough points to stay at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers with the staff headed by Jorge Guerrero! This is absolutely the best place to stay in NYC. The level of customer service and personal attention and concern will exceed your expectations. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.

When we walked into our room, you could see right away that this was not going to be enjoyable. The room was old, dusty and falling apart. The blinds to the windows were broken, the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and to top it all off, the heater was not working and only blowing out cold air. After several complaints and 2 maintenance men later, the hotel finally switched our room. My husband and I, had to grab all of our belongings and in our pajamas, switch rooms at 2 in the morning, only to be given another room with 2 double beds. This room still had no heat and it wasn't until the 4th maintenance man, that we were told that the entire hotel had no heat. In addition, our room was not cleaned. After a long day of walking through the city, we wanted to come back to the hotel and rest and wash up, only to find that our room hadn't been cleaned and so we had to call and wait for the cleaning lady to come and clean the room at 6 o'clock in the evening.

Only a couple of mins from Central Park and you are right near Times Square and Broadway. The rooms were clean and tidy and beds changed with fresh sheets every day, the rooms are about the same size as travelodge rooms maybe a little bigger but they are more than adequate for a place to stay. We was out most of the day and night and used the hotel as a base to sleep. I would definatly return their, the service from the staff was expectional. The only thing to be careful of is the charges - the hotel is quite expensive but then so is most of New York $24 for 2 bottlesof Bud on room service and whatever you do DONT use the phones in the hotel to call home, we didnt realise how expensive the call charges were and we had a high phone bill when we left, you can buy a phone card for $2 which gives you about 10 mins. There is a nice deli right across the road that sells a good selection of sarnies and coffee etc, we used that rather than the starbucks in the hotel as it was just so dear. Tours - Everything that you really need to do and see is within walking distance but we would recommend the city limit tours, if you see a guide outside the hotel (they wear blue and yellow) they will give you the best package depending on what you want to do. One thing we did do is book the tickets for the empire state building before we went and we got the express tickets which is highly recommened, you skip all the queues and you really dont want to waste all that time in the queues especially if its busy. Woodbury common is good if you buy alot of desiger clothes you will prob find it cheaper their, its a designer retail oulet very much like bicester village. We found a few bargins there but unless you are reallly into designer stuff i wouldnt really bother we spent a whole day there which on reflection was a bit of a waste. If you are only staying for a few days and trying to fit alot in you can see the statue of liberty but unless you really want to go on the viewing tower you could just stay on the boat. You can still take some great photos and see how big she is but once you get off the boat there isnt alot to do but look at it. The night tour is good and takes you down to Broklyn Bridge and the uptown and downtown tours are also good too. At central park its worth paying for a bike guide to take you round as its massive and unless you want to spend all day there this is a quicker way of seeing it all - it was very relaxing and they give you loads of information that we wouldnt of really known what we was looking at had we of walked around. Generally New York like most of the other big world cities is expensive and the tipping thing is big there, on average we found they add 18% onto your bill and lunch / dinner for 4 was coming out at about $160. Im sure there are cheaper places but we just didnt find them. I would highly recommend Dave's Famous BBQ Ribs- excellent food, good choice of menu, and you feel like you have had your monies worth. Wouldnt recommend Ellens Stardust Diner, food very expensive and not good value for money at all.

It's right across the street from the Sheraton Manhattan (and often confused), but this is the superior hotel. My stay was exceptional. Immediately upon my arrival I was met by a delightful and helpful front desk attendant. She upgraded my room immediately (in the spirit of full disclosure, I'm a Platinum level guest). I had a few specifics I needed help with, including a refrigerator because I'm nursing a new baby. She was happy to assist. When I entered room 4801, it exceeded all my expectations. It had views from 3 sides of the hotel, including the river. Nice decorations and included a den, dining area, office, bar, 2 bathrooms and bedroom. I was extremely pleased and surprised. During the course of my stay, I was met with stellar service from housekeeping to in-room dining. The thai soup with shrimp is very good. One thing that is worthwhile is the Club-level ammenities (whether you are a Starwood preferred guest or pay the small upgrade to use). You are able to partake in both the full continental breakfast in the morning, as well as the happy hour appetizers and treats in the afternoon. A great way to start and end your day at the hotel. On my last evening, someone from the GM's office called to inquire about my stay. and I told them about my service, experience and stay thus far. I also noted how disappointed I was in my recent Westin stay (when I treated my Mother to a trip to NYC to attend the US Open). I provided specifics on both what their hotel was doing well and what I was upset about with regard to the Westin. Within 15 minutes of that call, I received another from Jorge Guerrero, the Guest Service Center Manager. He thanked me for taking the time to complete their quick survey and asked if he could send up a treat compliments of the hotel for my time.

Close to Central Park, Subway right out the front doors, close to theaters, Times Square, restaurants etc. Couple of small issues, one with a wake up call that did not happen. They upgraded our room, gave us access to club level and sent a bottle of wine up the next night. \"Nice Touch\". The light breakfast was nice but watch out for the 5-8pm offering. I thought it was snacks & drinks however our 3 drinks came to $45.00. Hmmmm, I must not have read the fine print. Overall however, I'd have to recommend the hotel. We've stayed at allot of hotels all over the world, A-Z, and while this is not the most elegant you'll find it's a good value with comfortable beds a nice lobby and a staff who are trying to do it right. With regards to close eating: You have to try the cart on 53rd and 6th. (Just 1 block) We got there at 1am and there were about 40 people in line. WOW. Saffron Rice, Chicken, Lamb Beef and a pita. A mix between Persian and Greek but with an American flair. What a meal for $8! And it's awesome! Try Carnigie's (7th & 55th, 1 block ) for Pastrami & Corned Beef sandwich. Best I have EVER had. Not cheap however $23 for a sandwich and expect a line. We split one between 3 of us and we were all full. They charge $3 for each person who's splitting. Sounds like allot but TOTALLY worth it. We also did Bar America, Bobby Flay's restaurant (1 block) VERY nice!

This was my forth time going (first time at this hotel). Originally I had booked a room with 2 beds. I knew rooms were small in the city and I told my friend's this, but they insisted to keep the reservation. I wanted a suite but they didn't have any but when I arrived they did, but I didn't like the rate I received. I have an Amer. Exp. Starwood card so I had a 50% off the rack rate coupon. I used that and I would not pay anything higher than the price they gave me to stay at this hotel. The rack rate is overpriced because of how old the hotel is (building built in the 1920's?). I ended up getting my own room and they placed me on the \"starwood preferred guest floor.\" The room was old, which is typical for nyc. The bed was good and the bathroom was in good condition, but small. The desk and AC needs improvements. The knob to adjust the AC was broken. I also would NOT touch the mini bar. My friend's moved some stuff and they charged them, but I was able to get them removed. The hotel and room was clean. Service was okay. It's a really busy hotel. From 2pm to 6 it is absolutely crazy. I arrived early to the hotel to check in and received the \"typical\" nyc attitude. When I arrived back I talked to a few good people. The person who put me on the spg floor was nice and courteous. I didn't eat at the hotel. There are 2 cafe's outside the hotel on 53rd st. One has outdoor seating. I don't know the name of the place, but it was a lot better than the place across the street called lindas? The location is good if you want to be a tourist. After going a few times to NYC my best suggestion is to get a room at battery park/downtown. I would have paid a little higher to stay at the Ritz-Carlton in battery park than this place. Also there regular rooms are 1.5x times the size of my basic room. Also the area appears newer than midtown. Going from midtown to downtown is pretty simple. Transportation to the airport was great. The hotel has drivers with S-Class Mercedes. Took one of those for $40. A taxi was $30. I would suggest this if you want a little comfort. When going to the hotel I took a shuttle and paid $45 for 3 people. It is best to get a taxi or get in a black lincoln cars.

People were literally dancing in the hallways and lobbies, not caring that no one could walk by them without being in danger of being kicked or hit by someone flailing around.

The reviews I recently read give a cross section between great and poor. A few were so ridiculous I could not believe we were speaking of the same property. Please be aware this is a fine hotel at a great location and anyone booking should feel most comfortable and satisfied. On this trip, check in took approximately 5-6 minutes (I requested a room with a view and got assigned a room on the 43rd floor with a fine view). Lobby, halls, corridor lighting, carpeting, elevators and public areas were updated and clean. The room, beds, sheets, television, blinds and bathroom were clean and in updated condition. No problems with housekeeping. Experienced travelers understand that standard hotel rooms in New York, or Tokyo, or Paris or London are relatively small when compared to typical beach or ocean side resorts or Las Vegas rooms, so room size should be a non-issue, as the rooms are typical for New York City. If you are not familiar with the Sheraton NY location, it is a 50 story hotel on Seventh Avenue at 53rd Street, which is 4 blocks from Times Square; 4 blocks from Carnegie Hall; 5 blocks from Central Park; 3 blocks from Rockefeller Center; 2 blocks from the Broadway Theater; and 1 block from the best deli sandwiches in New York (Stage Deli). There is a contemporary internet lounge/bar/coffee and seating area in the lobby as well as additional seating/lounge areas. The staff behind the reception and tour desks were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.

The hotel is massive and does not have an intimate atmosphere (taking into account the fact that it's NYC). The lobby was always crowded with masses of people at all hours of the day, but the elevators were surprisingly quick. The Sheraton Manhattan across the street is much better if you want a big hotel with a more quiet, intimate surrounding. Now for the most disappointing part of our stay...Service. Service at the reception is incredibly slow. They have 4 people working at 8am when there is no crowd but 1 person working at 6pm which is prime check-in time. There were 5 of us in line and we waited about 15 minutes to get served! Concierge - both times that I spoke with them, I encountered rudeness! The first lady was too busy cleaning her counter to answer my question properly- didn't even look at me. The guy on the second day was too busy talking and laughing with his colleagues- he was able to pull away from his conversation for a second to rudely answer my question. Luggage Room - We checked out early on our last day and wanted to drop off our luggage for storage. The line went all through the lobby and we waited in line for almost 30 minutes to drop off our luggage!! Maybe think about expanding your space and staff to accommodate your 1000 guests!!! For a hotel chain that prides itself on excellent service, I was very disappointed. The room itself was okay. The beds were really comfortable and the long desk under the window was handy. The room is quite small, which is expected for a NYC hotel, so no surprise there. The bathroom is small as well and definitely not fitting of a \"4 star\" hotel. To be honest, the size didn't bother us as much, rather it was the black moldy stuff in the cracks of the shower tiles... disgusting. Nothing bad can be said about the location of this hotel.

THE GOOD The price was great, but I'll credit Priceline for that, more than the Sheraton. Likewise, the location was superb. Close to all midtown attractions, Central Park, Times Square, Fifth Square, etc. Can't think of a better Manhattan location. The hotel is huge but the elevator service was fast and efficient. Check-in line was fairly long but efficient once I got the front desk. Staff was very professional and courteous. I parked my car in the attached garage for $42 a day. Dropping it off was quick and efficient (picking it up another matter -- see below). My room was spacious. I was on the 10th floor so the room was of office buildings and the street below. Not bad, but nothing special. Beautiful flat screen LG television. Of course I wasn't in my room enough to watch much. The bed and linens were clean and the Sheraton bed, like all Sheraton beds I've slept in was very comfortable. A large desk in front of the window was provided. This was one of the best hotel desks I've ever seen. Internet service provided (wired, not free -- again, see below). I used the concierge on to ask for directions to a specific popular museum uptown. She was very helpful. There is not a real restaurant in the hotel, but I went to the bar for a late night meal and drink. The food was fine. The service, not so great. Bathroom was clean enough. There was a little black in the grout lines but this did not bother me. I checked my luggage during the day after I checked out. The checkroom was fast and efficient, which is more than I can say for the last hotel I stayed in in New York. They do charge $3.25 a bag, but I'd rather have that than free with an optional tip. I think you get better service this way. THE BAD The room was very warm, bordering on hot. I could not find any way to adjust the AC. Remember this was July. There was a vent on the top of the desk that was literally encrusted with dust. It was disgusting. It was blowing slightly cool air. Every time I went into the hall, it was a relief to be able to breathe! If I'd stayed more than one night, I would have asked the front desk for another room,though reading here it seem this is a chronic problem. internet service in the room is wired and $15 a day. For four stars, i expected wireless and free. Come on! Much, much cheaper hotels have this. It was fast enough though. There was supposedly free Wireless in the lobby, but who wants to schlep to the lobby just to check email? No refrigerator in the room. There was a coffee maker that I didn't use. There should have been a refrigerator. The bathroom, while clean enough, lacked amenities found in three star hotels. There were tiny bottles of shampoo and conditioner. No lotion. Not high quality brands. The hairdryer was tiny and low powered and not attached to the wall. Again, very poor quality. As I mentioned, dropping off my car was smooth, but I had to wait at last 20 minutes to pick it up. This seemed excessive. I went to the bar for a late night drink and dinner. The drink and food was fine but the service was poor. The bartender was completely preoccupied with a personal call on his cell phone. I repeatedly had to practically yell at him to get his attention. It was like he could not be bothered to do his job. Then, I asked for the left over that from my meal to be packed up to take up to my room. They did this without complaint, but when i got to my room, the silverware was filthy -- caked with food. Utterly gross. BOTTOM LINE Great location, mass market hotel. Room has some nice amenities but climate control and dust is a serious issue. Does not deserve four star rating.

I made our reservation through Priceline for a very reasonable rate ($118) but, after reading some of the very negative TA reviews, I had concerns about the quality and cleanliness of the rooms.

I emailed the Sheraton to tell them that this was a very special surprise birthday trip, and to ask if it was possible to request a recently renovated room on a high floor with a view. I received an immediate email reply, thanking me for my email and advising that our request would be noted in our reservation. I crossed my fingers. We arrived at approx. 8:00 p.m. Friday evening and checked in with no difficulty. Although we were advised that there was no room with a view available, we were given a room on the 44th floor. The gentleman at check-in advised that this was a club floor with complimentary breakfast Monday through Friday. We were surprised and grateful. When we reached our room, we found that there was a nice view of the surrounding Midtown area, rather than an obstructed view or a view of another building directly across the street, and we were pleased. The furnishings were slightly worn, but the room was very clean, including the bathroom, which was large and included a nice selection of amenities. As we were unpacking, there was a knock on our door, and a waiter came in and surprised us with a small cheese and fruit plate, a bottle of imported mineral water, and a lovely note with birthday greetings from Felicia Carrington-Nelson, who had corresponded with me via email about the special nature of this trip. I can't begin to express how much this very kind and generous gesture meant to both of us, particularly the birthday celebrant. We have stayed in some very, very nice hotels and B&Bs over the years, but we have never had a hotel respond in such a generous and personal manner, particularly given that we had made our reservation on Priceline. What a wonderful start to a wonderful weekend. The hotel's location made it very easy for us to do everything on our itinerary, including visits to the Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, a Broadway show, a lovely dinner uptown, and the Staten island ferry. The kindness and generosity shown to us at the Sheraton made our entire weekend extra special. Monday breakfast in the club room was absolutely terrific, with a large selection of cereals,bagels, pastries, fruit, oatmeal, boiled eggs, yogurt, juices, and coffee. The club room was lovely, and the breakfast was a fabulous start to the last day of our weekend. As others have noted, the hotel provides a very organized left-luggage service so that guests can leave their luggage for the day after checking out. We knew that there was a small charge for this, and we were very pleased with the efficiency and security of this service. And because this is such a large hotel, taxis are always available to take guests to the airport or train station. Our entire experience at the hotel was extremely positive and enjoyable, and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others. After returning, I emailed Felicia to thank her for her thoughtfulness in making this birthday trip to New York so special for us, and I wanted to let other TA members know about the wonderful service that we received, both before and during our stay.

If you pay the full price to stay here, I understand the disappointment - but if you book at the priceline rate (and make sure to ask for an upper-level room), you should have no worries!", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cSheraton Towers~trust me...I wouldn't stay there\u201d", "Author": "partyvegas", "ReviewID": "UR34242332", "Content": "My husband decided to take me on a whirlwind trip to NY again so I was so excited. He booked the trip before I had a chance to help him. Bless his heart. I always come to Tripadvisor to check out reviews...too late! When I read the reviews I was quite concerned because the bad outweighed the good from most people. SoI called ahead and told them that I would like a \"renovated room.\" She said \"Ma'm they are all renovated.\" so I relaxed and decided what will be will be. When we got there we saw that the lobby was beautiful~like a Vegas hotel, so we were happy. The front desk people were EXTREMELY polite...in fact everyone right down to the bell hop were great! They even gave us an early check in which we were grateful for since we were tired. We got up to the room and it wasn't too bad...small, the furniture is on the older side, something I could deal with, but when I went into the bathroom it smelled like old dishrag smell. Very musty and they had covered the odors with a spray that was horrific. So, we called downstairs and they sent the bellhop up to take us to another room. It was on the lower floor. I walked in...it was somewhat clean, I went into the bathroom and smelled the same smell! (I just wish I didnt have such a good nose at times). The bellhop was so nice that I just grinned and said \"This is much better \" and we stayed. As I was getting in the shower later that day I smelled the wall and that's what it was! The rags that they used to wipe down the walls and floors was the old musty dishrag smell. Soo...I had some body spray with me! Every day for 4 days I sprayed down the walls with Vanilla Spray and it seemed to cover the smell. The maid service did leave the room neat and went beyond the call of duty, but I just couldn't get past the smell. The air conditioning unit is a unit on the floor which has the air shooting right onto the bed. The first night I froze. You can't change the vent direction it only blows one way, so I took the phonebook propped the whole metal cover that covers it, and stood the air vent straight up.,,,,,it worked...problem was solved. To be a new room, the carpeting smelled musty, very musty. Trust me, I would never steer anyone wrong....but for the money that you pay it is not worth it. Last time we went to NY we stayed at the Mariott Marquis on Times Square, and that is where we will stay again. Sure, its even more, but MUCH CLEANER, and updated. Also we called downstairs to the concierge to ask them about a restaurant and hubby put the call on speaker phone. After 45 minutes of holding, he went downstairs. They said if they are \"with someone that they are not allowed to answer the phone.\" The good thing about the Sheraton is, that the location is wonderful. It is right in the middle of the theatre district and 2 blocks from the Observatory and where they film the Today Show. Also if you walk straight down the street about 5 blocks which isn't bad at night, you are in Times Square. Everyone at the Sheraton was very nice, that is the good thing that I have to say about it....it would be much better if HOUSEKEEPING would get their act together. They need to use clean cloths to wash the showers and clean mops. I would rate this as a 2 1/2 star hotel...NOT A 4 . I was very disappointed as it was not a Mariott! However, in Fl we have stayed at Embassy Suites and loved it...it just doesn't have to be a Mariott...but in NY I would only stay at a Mariott or a Hilton. I can handle a room being small or whatever but cleanliness is a must. We took the Red Bus tour. It is well worth it if you want to see the city. We bought a 2 day ticket since we wanted to sightsee and get off and on at our leasure.( the 2 days starts from the time that is posted on the pass when you buy it, so best to start the time right when you will use it) We went to the Statue of Liberty, which is a must do trip. It was so exciting. Two days after we got back they opened the crown to the public. However, I think you have to have 2 wks notice before you can go into it. They said it is very high and people couldn't make it all the way up and they got out of breath....so you must be in good shape to attempt it. When we got off the boat, we walked to the World Trade Center and took pictures. We ate at a little sandwich shop which was delish. The last day we were there we only had til noon to shop, so we took a taxi which was about $15.00 one way to the Chinatown district. It is quite aways, but it was worth it, we had fun and bought some neat jewelry from the shops. REMEMBER*** if you head to the airport in a shuttle that is a complimentary shuttle from the hotel to the airport....you need to leave 4 hrs ahead of time. We left 3 hrs and barely made it there. It took our shuttle driver an hour and a half.... after stopping everywhere under the sun and taking back roads so he wouldn't have to pay the toll at rush hour. We had it figured if we left 3 hrs ahead of time we had plenty of time. We had 15 min to spare. We also will not travel on Travelocity again because, we wanted to change the hotel after we had the tickets and they said $600 to change it or something ridiculous. Much better to take a taxi to the airport. I think it's $40 but well worth it. We loved NY and will go back again, but have learned some lessons. Book your flight and your hotel separately. I refused to let the room ruin my trip...thank God for the body spray! ha Enjoy your trip and I hope if you stay here that your stay is better and that someone from the hotel has read this review.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, Great location\u201d", "Author": "disneyjean", "ReviewID": "UR34178939", "Content": "We were only staying one night and arrived to check in very early.

Without doubt in the past this hotel has been a fantastic and top class hotel but not today as it requires serious updating especially in the bedrooms. Our room on 43rd floor in size and general layout was more than satisfactory but the general conditions were not worthy of an international hotel chain. The dark brown coloured carpet was old, frayed and unclean and looked as if it had not been changed for years. The bed linen also left a lot to be desired and wasn't ever changed during the period of our stay. The bathroom although very small but adequate had black moulding stains around the bath and wall areas and suggested total neglect. The daily attendance by staff was simply to change bathroom towels and rearrange bedclothes as no hovering, dusting or polishing took place during our stay. We never made a complaint to reception as I had ignored other comments and reviews that warned readers of problems at this hotel.

The hotel is huge and very busy but we were checked in pretty quickly and given a room in the tower which houses floors 21 to 29. I have heard people complaining that they have had to wait for ages for the elevators in the other section of the hotel but here we never waited more than a few seconds. Our rooms were on floor 21. We had a couple of initial problems as the floor in the room next to the airco was soaking wet and it smelled slightly of damp. However a quick call to reception and they sent someone up with keys for another slightly larger room along the corridor. I was sharing with a friend so we had a double double. The room was large enough for both of us and had a really large LG LCD HD tv. D\u00c3\u00a9cor I thought was really nice and the beds were super comfortable. None of the back ache I normally have after sleeping in a strange bed. Coffee maker in the room was handy for a pre breakfast coffee in the morning. We also had a small problem with the room safe which had been locked by the previous occupant. Again this was efficiently dealt with by the front desk and they sent someone up within a few minutes to open it. It amazes me that some people give this hotel a 1 star rating. Honestly what is it that they are expecting for the price? If they have paid like $300 plus per night then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their own fault for not researching cheaper rates. With the cost of real estate in Midtown Manhattan why do they expect palacial enormous rooms? None of the staff were ever rude to me, perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because I treat people with the respect that I expect myself. If there are long queues for check in then that probably because a bus load of people have just turned up. The staff only have one pair of hands. Anyway I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone especially if you can get it on Priceline or Hotwire.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Location, Great Value, but not 4 Stars\u201d", "Author": "Newlywed_7", "ReviewID": "UR32191656", "Content": "This hotel is in a prime location, just a few blocks south of Central Park and a few north of Times Square. Easy walking distance to St. Patrick's, Rockefeller Center, and Broadway and only about a mile to Penn Station & the Empire State Building. The hotel has a nice, fancy lobby. We didn't try any of the hotel restaurants, but there is a nice bar in the lobby. There are plenty of quick elevators, which we took to our small, king bed room on the 42 floor. We had a great view of the city from our room. The room was somewhat updated with a modern feel: a nice LCD TV, comfortable king bed, desk, and nice marble bathroom counter. The room had the usual amenities: iron, hairdryer, and a coffee maker with single serve Starbucks coffee. It was a small room, however, and although it was updated some, it seemed a bit old. The bathroom and linens were clean, but the walls and carpet were older. Basically, it was a nice, small, clean room with a great view. My problem with this hotel is that it is rated at 4 stars, and our room was not a four star room. There was nothing exceptional about it. It was a great bargain though - we got it by naming our own price of $117 a night. At that price, this is a tremendous value for such a good location. We just were not wowed by the hotel. From our experience here and at the Sheraton Baltimore, it seems that Sheratons are nice, clean, comfortable hotels at good rates. Baggage check was $3.25 a bag, if you want to leave your bags for a few hours after you check out. The front desk staff was helpful but not overly friendly. The concierge was knowledgeable and kind.

High-Speed Internet is available for $14.95 per day. The room had very good A/C, although it was a little tricky to find the controls for. I had to call the front desk and ask where the controls were, as they are hidden inside a box which is below a grill in the back of the desk area! I have seen reviews saying the rooms were warm, but I think those travelers probably didn't go to the trouble to find the A/C controls and just assumed the rooms didn't have A/C.

I, like many other reviewers on tripadvisor, booked the Sheraton through Priceline for $100 a night and ran right to this site to read the reviews. I was quickly made nervous by what I read! I realize that when you book on Priceline you aren't guaranteed a specific room or bed type. So the first thing I did was email the reservation staff at the hotel and requested a king size bed and a room on a newly renovated floor. I got an email back in less than 24 hours stating that my requests had been noted. When I arrived at 2:30 PM, we only had to wait roughly 3 minutes for the small line to work it's way to the reception desk. The gentleman at the desk mentioned that we had requested a king bed on a high floor (the renovated ones) and we were off to our room #3433. The elevators quickly arrived and we walked to our room, fully anticipating a negative experience like many other reviewers had. We walked through the door and started to inspect the room. Yes, the room was small, but it is NYC. We were not bothered by the size, although we did experience what many others have experienced on this site. The room was HOT! Not like warm, but HOT!! Granted it was roughly 68 degrees outside when we checked in, but there was no reason for the warmth in the room. Actually there is, read some other reviewers below who explain the situation. Anyway, I opened the windows and called down for a fan which arrived in less than 15 minutes. The room itself was relatively clean,although we did find an old sock in the closet and what appeared to be a small patch of mold on the ceiling in the bathroom. The carpets were clean and the room appeared to be renovated with a large flat screen, comfy bed, and restoration hardware pieces in the bathroom. For $100 I was impressed with what we received. The hotel staff was informative, got free wifi in the lobby, room was more than I expected from reading the reviews. Many have mentioned bugs, mice, or paper thin walls on this site. I did not see or hear anything out of the ordinary in our room. The location is FANTASTIC!!! The subway is basically 15 steps from the door. We walked to Central Park, Times Square, etc. The staff recommended some great places to eat and even helped us find a place to buy socks for my wife who packed in terms of fashion, not comfort...a big mistake! All in all, for what I paid it was FANTASTIC. If I had paid full price, I may have been disappointed. Pros: Location, great staff, fast elevators and check in/out process Cons: Could have been a little cleaner in both the room and hotel itself.

We also asked for a room on a higher floor and a room with a good view and we were given both with no trouble. The room / bathroom was spacious enough and there were two double beds (one bed and a couch would have been better perhaps) and it was clean. It was a little tatty in places but I don't expect a busy hotel room to be pristine! The view was excellent - we were north-facing on the 7th Avenue side on the 28th floor and could see a glimpse of Central Park and the river from where we were - great! You could hear a bit of traffic noise but hey - you are in a busy city! There is free wi-fi in the lobby area and we never had any trouble accessing this. We had a laptop and could take a seat and check emails as much as we wanted but there are a also a few free workstations dotted around and these are also connected to a printer. They were very busy at breakfast / dinner time but if you are up before 7am you will have no trouble. The location is excellent - 7th Avenue subway is literally right at the door and this gives you easy quick access to the rest of the city. If you fly into JFK take the air train to Sutphin Blvd (near Jamaica Street) and the jump onto the 'E' line - you should be at the hotel in about 1 hour with no hassle and it only costs $7 each. A few people on this site have complained about the 'left-luggage' charge but I didn't have a problem with this. Unlike other hotels this place we more professional. The bags were labelled and we were given receipts. There was an attendant there all day to serve you and I felt it was quite secue. $3.25 per bag per day wasn't unreasonable. One good tip - if, like us, you check out early in the day and then fly the same evening you can go for a last day in the city and then come back tot eh hotel and have a shower (completely free) in the leisure club downstairs. They'll even give you a towel and soap! However, I have stayed at a number of higher-end hotels before and most of them have just had a bit more of the 'wow' factor.

After being told that this was the hotel that priceline gave us, we came on to trip advisor and read some very disappointing reviews. We were a little apprehensive and so we called the hotel ahead to make sure that we were getting a \"renovated room\"- hotel staff were not too friendly over the phone and that should have been our first clue that we should have stayed elsewhere. We got to a very, VERY rainy New York City only to find out that we were too early to check in. The hotel did nothing to make us feel at home. Once we checked in, we received a room on the preferred floor that was small, and very dusty. We called down to the front desk to see if there was anything they could do (especially since the dust was starting to become a problem for my allergies and asthma), and they told us they couldn't move us but they would send up housekeeping. Housekeeping didn't come until Day 3 of our stay, when we finally went down to complain. On top of this, as visitors to the city, we expected that the concierge would be helpful in planning our activities in the city, especially considering the horrible weather we were experiencing. We were DEAD wrong. The first woman who \"helped\" us was not only rude but also unhelpful when we asked about buying tickets to a show. We ended up going to the box office ourselves, without any advice to do so from her. Our second experience was with another member of the concierge team, who told us to go 1 hour early to the lower east side area where we had made a dinner reservation because there was so much to do. We got there and EVERYTHING was closed, not to mention it was mainly residential. We were thoroughly unimpressed, and wet since we had to wait in the rain until we could go to the restaurant. The next morning, we were lucky enough to have to deal with the same woman from Day 1 again at concierge, who told us at 9:30am to go to Soho to go shopping, but neglected to mention that absolutely everything was closed until noon. By the time things opened, we were soaking wet and very much not in the mood to shop anymore.

My husband and I were very pleasantly surprised. First, for that price, this hotel can't be beat. Not sure that I'd pay full price, but for $100, we could walk to almost any attraction you'd want to see in NYC, terrific restaurants, and famous spots like the Carnegie deli or just down the street. The hotel staff were very, very nice and when I wrote to one of the managers in advance, telling him of my previous bad experience at another Sheraton, Jorge Guerrero the Guest Services Center Manager, responded immediately, assured me he would personally see that our stay was a great one, and we did. The room was a little bit dusty and the bathroom could have used a little bit more attention, but nothing that would deter me from staying again. Rooms are small and the bed took up most of the space, but if you are not planning to be in your room for any length of time, it doesn't matter. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Don't get this hotel confused with the Sheraton Manhattan across the street, which does look a bit dingy and run down, be sure you book with Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers.

It is barely a three-star hotel in my opinion, and definitely far from a four-star hotel. The lobby is depressing.

Our beds were never made, just the covers pulled up, and the bathroom mirror was never washed. The room wasn't vacuumed during our five days. We did have two glass glasses when we arrived, but they disappeared the first day, and after that, it was just plastic cups. Four stars? Whatever. As for location, it is ideal. The staff were pleasant enough and the beds were very, very comfortable! Even for NYC though, dining in the area was exceptionally pricey. We stuck to the street vendors and deli/buffets as much as possible. Lindy's diner across the street charges $16 for a basic 3-egg breakfast! In viewing the local menus in restaurant windows, that seemed pretty standard. The Metro diner across the street charged $18 for a basic hamburger. I can say that as compared to other parts of NYC, these prices are way high. I imagine it must be because only tourists eat in the Times Square area? Maybe the locals know to eat in other neighborhoods.... So, pack some granola bars and your own sanitizing wipes, go to Priceline, and take a chance. Happy traveling!

At 8:10, the attendant checked out; I was in the hallway when she walked out of the room with her luggae. No one from housekeeping came to clean the room.

Finally, at 10:50, I went into the hall and spoke with the housekeeping attendant (who was finished with the room and already working on another down the hall); she let me into the room. The front desk never called to say that the room was ready and never sent up a set of keys. About 45 minutes later, the bellman knocked on our door with another family checking in! The next morning, I stopped at the front desk to make sure we were even checked in to the room and to receive a set of keys.

Ellen's Stardust Diner is just down the street and is a must for anyone visiting the city, the staff sings the whole time you are there and are very entertaining, we really enjoyed our breakfast and would definitely go back the next time we are in town. The only downfall of the hotel is the parking garage, which is not really owned by the hotel. It is expensive and we had to wait 50 minutes for our car, it was check out time on a Sunday morning and there were a lot of unhappy people wating the same amount of time for their car. The parking garage charges $42.00 per 24 hours so you need to keep track of the time you check in.

Some people find it very pleasant, others were hugely disappointed and seem almost angry about their stay. Surely the hotel is the same for all, so perhaps the reviews say more about the reviewers? I have stayed at the Sheraton New York three times over the past few years, always when I could get a good deal (under $250 a night, sometimes as low as $179 plus taxes). I get these rates through the hotel website, not Priceline or Hotwire. I recommend that visitors to New York do the same--comparison shop through the websites and book directly. There are usually discounts for pre-paying. I agree with others who complain that the Sheraton is not a true luxury hotel. But you do not need to pay a luxury price here. Posh hotels in NYC can easily cost $600 a night. The more upscale Westin and W hotels are always at least $50 a night more than the Sheraton. People need to be savvy when booking and realistic in their expectations. If a carpet is slightly worn, that does not make the hotel \"dirty.\" If you have to wait ten minutes to check in, that is not a tragedy at a huge New York hotel. Even if you are a Starwood Preferred Member. In my opinion, here are some of the positives about the Sheraton New York: the elevators are fast and readily available. Security guards monitor who goes up in the elevators, all night long. The beds are comfortable, with multiple pillows and crisp linens. Each room has a desk with internet access (not free in the room, alas, but that is typical in NY). You have a coffee maker and Starbucks coffee to brew. The window treatments are very functional, with a perforated shade you can lower during the day that allows some light to come in, and blackout curtains for night. The rooms are surprisingly quiet given the hotel location. The gym is very nice, one of the largest I've seen in a hotel. The lobby bar is attractive and becomes a Starbucks in the morning. The lobby itself is huge and a great place for people watching. I've never had any service issues here. I've been greeted by the doormen and helped with my luggage, and helped to get a taxi if needed. If you need special help, for example for an elderly traveller, ask for it! True, there is no minibar, but I never liked them anyway. There are dozens of nearby shops where you can pick up some drinks and snacks. The negatives: Parking is pricey (as it would be at any hotel in NY). It can also be a hassle waiting for your car at the end of a stay. This is a big hotel, and at times you will encounter other people wanting to do the same thing as you.

When I received the news from \"Hotwire\" as to the name of the hotel I immediately looked up the reviews on Tripadvisor and was scared out of my mind by all of the negative comments. So it was with lots of apprehension that we entered the lobby to register on Sunday. Here is what we found: only a short wait to register and we were assigned room 1030 on the 10th floor. The lift was fast and we were swiftly at our room. The room was like the picture and had two full size beds. Everything was clean to our satisfaction. The coffee maker was such that it made individual cups which we liked. Our window was one we could open and we did so the first night but it was a bit noisy so we closed it and put a towel over the register because the room was a bit too warm. This was the only criticism that I had read that was justified: the temperature of the room was not controlable. However, the towel helped and we slept very comfortably. I believe we had a 42\" LCD TV. Especially nice was an extra mirror in the bathroom that my wife and granddaughter appreciated for doing their faces. In summary, the room was great and the location even greater. Sunday night we met a relative to eat with at Patsy's Pizzeria on about 84th west of Central Park. We walked since we all wanted some excercise. The salad I had was excellent and we heard it was one of the best Italian Pizzerias around.

It was Valentine's Weekend and fashion week, so it was difficult to find rooms in NY for a reasonable price. While I am accustomed to staying at higher rated hotels, I assumed that the brand name of Sheraton would provide a decent room at a decent price, which it did. The room was pretty clean (though I agree with the comment posted earlier about tired carpet.) There is a flat screen tv, but no dvd player or vcr. I never turned the tv on and spent very little time in my room. However, the service at the hotel was dreadful. The front desk check-in process was rushed, as if they couldn't wait to shuffle me out and get through the line of a few people checked in. The following morning, I asked the the customer service line for a comb to be sent to my room (the hotel does provide several conveniences, such as toothpaste, razor and so forth if you need it). After three calls over the course of 45 minutes, I gave up on the comb and made due. I stopped at the front desk on my way out the door and let them know the problem with the comb and asked if they would have it delivered while I was gone. It did arrive some time during the day. One night of our stay, we stopped in the restaurant to have a late night (10:15 pm) dessert. (We were well dressed and polite.) I asked if they were still serving and they said yes and seated us at a dirty table. I asked them to wipe it, which they did. We looked for a waitress and she kept avoiding our table. I finally went up the the host and asked politely if he would send a waitress over. She finally came to our table at 10:40 pm and said she would be glad to help us, if we wanted a cocktail, but wouldn't serve us food because the kitchen closed at 10:30. Clearly, she had pulled a stunt. They were obviously tired and wanted to go home without having to serve another customer. We left and reported this to the front desk, who nodded and made a gesture that told me she had heard this one before. She didn't really want to do anything for me, but when I made no move from the desk, she offered us a fifty dollar credit toward any restaurant in the hotel. I accepted this even though I had no desire to have a meal in the hotel. We decided on breakfast on our last day. No wonder she offered us fifty dollars! The breakfast was 34.95 per person for buffet! Period! NO choice... no cold menu, no a la carte, nothing. Normally, in NY, we just grab a quick bite at Dean and Delucca or Au Bon Pain for breakfast, but to use our credit, we had the breakfast there. It was actually fresh and delicious, although we ate light and moved on. I used the concierge service as well. The first gentleman was rude and couldn't wait to get us to move on so he could keep the line short. The next female concierge was very friendly and tried to be helpful, but she kept giving us the wrong directions. I know NY well, and kept saying, \"Would you show me on a map?\" When we would get the map out, she would show me the wrong way and then I would say, \"Isn't it this way?\" and she would look at it and say, \"Oh, yes, you are right, I am sorry\". At least she was polite and tried to be helpful. I asked her for a suggestion for a restaurant for dinner and told her we wanted something hip and trendy. She really could only come up with an ordinary Italian Restaurant (something like Patsy's, which my New York friends said was fine, but nothing great), so we went to Budokan instead. (I had been to the one in Philadelphia and new that it would be fabulous.) Great! This is where the rehearsal dinner scene in Sex and the City Movie was filmed. Food was incredible, service -- the best, but that is another review. Back at the hotel one morning, there was a huge group of teenagers in jeans and t-shirts (50 or so of them) with adults all sitting on the floor in the middle of the lobby with all their luggage strewn about, while they waited to check out. I have no idea why the hotel didn't escort them all to a less obtrusive (perhaps more comfortable) place to wait or at least move them off to the side. It looked like a sit-in or something. Ridiculous! On our last day, the hotel was less busy and checkout was smooth. I was also able to get a late checkout for 1:30, which was a very nice accommodation. I probably wouldn't stay there again if I had a choice.

The generous living room of our suite featured a beautiful and comfortable blue velvet sofa, 2 arm chairs, nice chrome lamps, a coffee table, a desk and a flat screen t.v . The coffee table was great for spreading out maps and guidebooks. Did I mention that there was a powder room off the side of the front entry?

The Sheraton location was excellent within walking distance of almost everything that we wanted to do. The crowds were huge but we expected crowds because of the holidays and above normal temperatures. We had very good flights from Dallas to NY and Laquardia Airport was busy but easy to move around with no luggage problems. Super Shuttle was a great way to get from the airport to the Hotel (45 min ride). We checked in on Dec 26 about 6 PM, the lines were long but moved fairly quickly with no problems. Only 3 people worked the check-in lines; the lines could have moved much faster with more staff. We did see huge lines and very upset people at the check-in counter several times as we went through the lobby during our stay. The lobby was packed with people and luggage which was expected. The staff was courteous and answered all of our questions we had during check-in. We asked about an upgrade on the room but none was avaliable because the Hotel was sold out. When we opened the door to our room (30th floor) the first thing that we saw was a partially made bed and one with the covers off and on the floor. I had read this problem in other earlier reviews and had hoped that this was isolated but evidently it is very common. I talked with other guests and many had the same problem. Hotel is under-staffed and this should not be a problem with the amount of money that we paid for this room. The handicapped room (which we did not ask for) was clean but had a musty odor and was in need of an upgrade. The bathroom was large, television great, and comfortable beds. However, the room temperature stayed hot because the thermostat did not work. Room was definitely not worth the price that we paid. The hotel staff was friendly, the concierge and bell captains were great and handled all our requests and questions. The restaurant was convenient but very expensive. We had only one meal there and it was nothing exceptional. The Starbucks in the Hotel was small with only limited options therefore we went to one of the two other Starbuck nearby locations. The Sheraton has a great and convenient location: 10-20 minutes from Rockfeller Center, Radio City, NBC show, Saks Fifth Ave, Central Park, FAO Scwhartz toy store) Walking distance to almost all the shows (Wicked, Lion King, Phantom of the Opera, Mamma Mia, David Lettermen) Subway stops were very close and easy to use (Metro Card sold at each stop if needed) Just pay close attention to which line you get on (uptown, downtown, etc...) Carnegie Deli is just down the street and was busy but we got in and out quickly. The sandwiches are huge (fair prices) which we shared. Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are a must see for everyone. Plan on 3-5 hours total based on crowds. Long security lines with airport type screening at several locations. World Trade Center Site is very moving and worth seeing. Empire State building lines were very, very long therefore we decided to see NYC skyline from the Top of the Rock at Rockfeller Center. Great view and marvelous spot for photos/videos. You can reserve time slots on line for the Top of the Rock -- no lines and no restrictions on how long you can stay on the observation deck. If possible reserve show tickets and tours in advance. Print out your e-tickets and take with you. This saved us long waits in ticket lines and made the trip much easier with less worries about arrving at the shows/tours late with long lines. We had a great time in New York City and we plan on returning.

We picked the hotel for its prime location for a family trip to NYC. We are Sheraton Gold members and I think we benefitted in the level of service we received. In fact, we mistakenly walked into the Sheraton across the street when we first arrived. The Bellman could not have been nicer and walked us over with all of our luggage to the New York Hotel and Towers right across the street. The lobby was nice and very busy. But, check in was quick for us in the express line for Gold members. We were on the top floor (50), as I had requested a higher floor with a quiet location. This was Club Level, but we were not charged extra. The only benefit was the use of the lounge for breakfast, but the lounge was only open one morning during our stay because of the holidays. My husband and our children enjoyed the breakfast, but I stick to coffee which I made in our room. The room was NYC small, but in good shape. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and we could hardly hear any street noise. There was an HDTV in the room. The bathroom was also small, but clean, with white tile and marble. The towels were basic hotel quality. We had a very nice view being so high up. The walls were thin though, and we could hear our neighbors. It also took 3 requests before we received the refrigerator for the room. But, the hotel did not charge us the daily fee. We were hardly in the hotel and room, so I cannot really comment on much else. Housekeeping was friendly and did a nice job. There was some dust on the nightstand, but I think that had to do with the heating vents, which seemed to run non-stop, with no controls in the room. It was hot at night, but I find most NYC apartments and hotels are very warm. Parking at the hotel totalled $120, which isn't bad for NYC. But, it took forever for us to get our car back.

The problem is that the hotel seems to have insufficient numbers of staff, especially in the lobby and garage. We had to wait 30 minutes to park our car even though there were only 10 cars in line in front of us. The parking attendant said we could have just given him the key and checked in, but we needed to pull the car into the garage to unload it. The driveway to the garage is too narrow to walk around cars with luggage in tow. The garage can accommodate only a dozen cars at a time, as cars are sent by elevator to other floors. The entire parking system was not designed to handle the number of cars that can be expected at a hotel with 1750 rooms. Once we had finally gotten our car into the garage, another line awaited us to check-in. There were about 20 people in line, but only three receptionists on duty even though the reception desk could have accommodated probably three times that many. We were lucky. The next day I saw 50 people in line to check in, again with only three receptionists on duty. When I finally got to a receptionist, she told me that all the rooms with two beds were gone and we were given a room with a king size bed, not adequate for two adults and a six year old. Furthermore, the hotel did not have any roll away beds left. The receptionist had an uppity attitude just like the parking attendant. I think they were just overwhelmed by the amount of people they had to handle and were doing their best to deal with many irate guests. I wanted to ask the concierge a question, but the line of at least a dozen people for just one concierge discouraged me from a third line. I just gave up and went to my room, which was good, but not great enough to compensate for all the long lines and unfriendly staff. The room was reasonable size. The built-in desk along the entire length of the window was great as it was twice the size of a regular desk and provided lots of space to set things on. The room had a flat screen TV, a long padded bench but no sitting chair, a safe, and a fairly well appointed bathroom. The towels were small and scratchy. The bed was reasonably comfortable. The pillows were very squishy and there were no extra pillows in the room. The temperature control worked fine. We often had long waits for elevators and sometimes the elevators were too full to accommodate any more passengers. This hotel is simply overwhelmed by the number of guests. The facilities and staff are simply insufficient to handle the huge numbers of people.

We waited in line for about 20 minutes in a SWAMPED lobby (I've never seen a lobby that crowded--it looked like a refugee camp). While we were in line, I witnessed some of the worst customer service I have ever seen as a reception worker yelled at a customer that he was wrong several times and basically told him to shove-it. We were told our room was not yet ready, but we could check our bags and check back after an hour. We joined the line to check our bags which was a nasty experience (25 min. line and very little organization). After an hour, we came back and were able to check in. We waited again in both lines--check-in and baggage check (another 30-35 min. easily). We got up to our room only to find that the toilet was broken. I called down to the front to see if we could change rooms, but they said they were booked solid and instead sent someone up to fix the toilet, which they did. The hotel room itself was decent--small, but that's to be expected in NYC. The room showed definite signs of wear, and could do with a revamp (i.e. stained carpets, worn bed frame, etc.). I'm not normally concerned with the little things--like towels being arranged the right way, etc., but on the last day, the bathroom looked a little messy even after it was cleaned, and our towels were just thrown up on the rack without being folded. I read someone else's review regarding this, and thought \"Come ON, you are really stretching on this one. Big deal.\" Just thought it was funny that apparently it is a trend. If you are looking for a no-frills hotel, the location of the hotel is fantastic--about 1 block from Times Square and located near the subway and lots of cafes/restaurants on 9th.

We had a nice walk from Penn Station to the hotel, where we waited in the check-in line for a good half hour. We were told the room was not ready yet, which we expected since we were early, and that we could check our bags. We waited another half hour on the bag check line; finally we were free to do our thing. We had a GREAT day and came back to the hotel around 11:30 pm. I went on the check-in line, which was even longer than before and NOT moving, while my husband went to retrieve our suitcase. About 20 minutes later my husband meets me in line, but without our suitcase. Apparently someone else had it! As disconcerting as that was, the treatment and lack of care the staff showed on our behalf was even worse. The line was still not moving and my husband tracked down a night manager who came over and finally got things moving again. When it was our turn we told the front desk receptionist our situation. He told us that we needed to speak with the baggage handlers and that there was nothing he could do. We informed him that they told us to speak with him; he adamantly disagreed and walked us over to the baggage area. Needless to say, he and the other gentleman got into an argument over who was responsible for this situation. When we asked to speak with the manager on duty he would not even come over and speak with us (he just kept checking people in) and told the front desk person to have the security office deal with it. So, the security office comes and informs us that they cannot call anyone about our bag until the morning. I, with clenched teeth, ask what they will do for us in the meantime. We had nothing, it was all given away. He was totally clueless. I suggested toothbrushes and toothpaste and at least robes to change into. Grudgingly he says OK, someone will bring them to our room. Now, on to the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We get to the room, which was small (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure the room at the Microtel I stayed at in Watertown, NY was bigger than this) and DIRTY. The carpet was stained and had definitely seen better days and the dust on the furniture was very visible. We called down to see if we could change rooms and were told that none were available. So, then we pull down the covers and sheets were FILTHY, makeup and other stains (only God knows what!) were on them. So, we call down a second time and ask for clean sheets. About one hour goes by and nothing. I call the security office again, the only competent person in the place, and ask when we will be getting our things. About another 20 minutes go by and finally someone brings us robes and toothbrushes, etc. We asked him for sheets and he seemed a bit putout since he was the only one on duty that night. Finally he comes back and changes the sheets for us; meanwhile his BO is stinking up the room. Around 1:45 am we crawl into be only to get up a few hours later and put on the same clothes and trudge down stairs. The manager on duty that morning was apologetic and did comp the room (but only after I told her I refused to pay). I have never in my life experienced such abdominal service.

I crossed my fingers and made the Club Level reservation using my Sheraton points. If I were pessimistic, this is how I would describe our stay. We arrived at 9:00 a.m. and checked in, but a room was not available yet. Came back around 12:30, picked up our keys and headed to the room. The lobby area was being renovated and at times, you could hear loud drills and hammering while in the lobby area. Our room was fairly small, but mostly clean. The wooden blinds definitely needed to be dusted and our view consisted mainly of the building across the street. The bathroom ceiling had a few paint peels and the shower/tub was very small. There was no way to control the temperature of the room. It is what it is! We visited the Club Lounge in the evening for free snacks and each morning for breakfast. There was no charge to store our bags on the day of arrival, but they did charge $3.25 per bag to store them the day we checked out. I am optimistic and here's how I really feel about our stay. When we arrived at 9:00 a.m., we did not expect a room to be ready - it wasn't - no big deal. We stored our bags with the bell captain. We were told that more than 1000 rooms were checking out that day (it was a Sunday) and to check back around noon. Returned at 12:30 and was able to pick up our key and head to our room on the 45th floor. Both trips to the front desk (original check-in and to pick up key) were very pleasant with friendly clerks. We headed to our room and was very pleased with the condition of our room - bigger than expected (for NY), very clean with what appeared to be a recently renovated bathroom, although there were 3 small penny-sized areas on the ceiling that appeared to be peeling (probably from the steamy showers and no fans in the bathroom).

The Club Lounge had a great TV with comfortable sofas/chairs/tables and 2 computers that you could use free of charge. I used the computer to do on-line check in for our departing flight. At times, the lobby area was loud from the renovations, but we didn't spend any time hanging out in the lobby so that didn't bother us.

We were in town to see \"The Lion King\" and stayed the night so we could spend the next day in the city as well.. They allowed us to check our bags & waived the fee when we arrived, as the rooms were not ready. We walked the streets for awhile before coming back to check-in.. As mentioned in other posts, check-in was nuts. The line was almost out the door, but it did move quickly. The lobby was packed, and the line to get our luggage was insane.. I do have to say this: I was traveling alone with my daughter, and when we checked-in, my family member asked if there was any way they could get our rooms as close together as possible (this was not guaranteed when we made our reservations but it never hurts to ask).. The woman behind the desk did everything she could to get us on the same floor.. The hotel was packed that weekend! Not only did she get both our rooms on the 28th floor, but we were only 4 doors apart.. The room was small, but fine for just the two of us. I don't think we would have been comfortable with a family of 4.. The beds take up most of the room, but it was clean and the beds were very comfortable. I am a light sleeper and I was not bothered by the noise outside.. A few horns, a few sirens, cars driving by - all add to the experience of sleeping in NY City, right? The bathroom was nice and very clean.. I can not believe some of the photos on this site of the mold & mildew and poor conditions of some of the rooms! I feel bad for those customers, as this was not our experience at all.. Our air conditioner was exceptionally cold (and we needed it that weekend as that was when the heat wave struck and it was a heat index of 108').. My sister's room was a different story.. Although her room was clean and looked just like mine, her air conditioning and internet did not work our entire stay).. She mentioned this when we checked-out and they took $100 off her room.. The bar in the lobby is pricey (but then so is NY).. One drink was $10 before tax & tip... My daughter's small soda was $5.00... The location is good.. We walked to Broadway, Times Square, the subway, to breakfast & lunch etc.. As several reviewers commented, the Door Man was excellent.. We can not remember his name, but we think it was something like \"Ricky\" or \"Randy\" ?? He was a man of color, on the shorter side, dressed in full uniform (had no hair under his hat) and we loved him! He was dripping sweat, and never complained, always greeted us with a smile, and worked hard at hailing cabs, opening doors, bringing luggage up the steps for the elderly, etc.. He remembered us each time we came outside, and he went above & beyond to get us into a limo one night and an SUV the next day, rather than hailing us 3 cabs (there were 11 of us and it was my sister's birthday) and he really made her feel special... When we checked-out we did have to pay the $3.25 per bag to check our luggage.. I didn't have a problem with this.. They do not have to allow you to leave your luggage there at all, so it's an extra convenience in my mind.. Would I stay here again? Probably - because our room was clean, the location was great, they gave my sister a discount for her AC and internet \"problems\", and because the doormen are helpful, kind and friendly! I would not want to pay $369 a night for the small room we had as others stated they paid. We paid $259 a night for each of the 4 rooms..

Our experience was exceptional. As most everyone has mentioned, the location is perfect. We were only there for two days so we wanted to be in the heart of the action and this hotel certainly can guarantee this convenience. A few blocks away from Times Square and Central Park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any better. Checking in was a breeze and Reception continued to be extremely helpful when we broke our key and then needed to mail some letters.

We were bombarded with options so we took these suggestions to the Concierge and he narrowed down the selection based on some questions he asked us to evaluate the types of activities that would appeal to us personally. He was bang on everything, including recommendations on where to eat and the best modes of transportation to our desired destinations. We stayed in a suite room on the 35th floor and the views were simply stunning. We could see Times Square from one window, the Hudson River from another and Central Park from the third. Superb! The weather was very warm and the Sheraton provided us with a perfect get-away from the streets during the mid afternoon heat. To retreat into our clean, air conditioned room in the sky was exactly what we needed after a big shopping spree. And the bottle water delivered to our room everyday came in very handy. Even though it is a large hotel, we found the service very personal. We encountered staff from Security to maids to bell-hops and everyone was helpful, polite and welcoming. As far as the rooms looking like the ones from the website \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I could swear they used the room we stayed in! It was exactly as advertised on their website. We had two bathrooms, a living area and the bedroom, resulting in loads of space. The room was spotlessly clean and everything in working order. The maid stopped in the evening to pull down our bed and leave us chocolates. I know it may seem a small luxury but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I mean about the personal service from a large hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big city person but my husband really wanted to see New York so we went \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I can confidently say that the Sheraton was both of our favorite part!

I had a standard, unrefurbished room on the 14th Floor. Pluses: Public areas give the impression of a classy hotel. Service at breakfast was exceptional - friendly and nothing was too much bother. Check-in through the kiosk was efficient and quick after a long day and a long flight in. Good to be able to make a cup of tea in the room. Location is good - handy for Central Park, Times Square, Broadway etc. Minuses: Room was shabby and small, the sort of quality I pay $60 while on vacation in France - room rate here was $345 a night. Room hadn't been updated in many years and felt very basic and with a musty smell. Air conditioning was efficient but of the 1970's variety. Overall it felt extremely ordinary. Overall I think Sheraton are taking advantage of high demands for rooms in NYC to deliver a very substandard product here. Having stayed in many Starwood properties this was by some stretch the worst and has affected my view of the way they value their customers.

I just got back yesterday from a trip to New York with my cousin and grandmother. I read the reviews on this hotel before I left, but there were equal amounts of good and bad reviews, so we figured we'd give it a shot! For the amount we paid (almost $3000.00!!) for 2 rooms for 2 nights, it is definitely not worth it! We were traveling to NY to see the Belmont Races but wanted to stay in the city where all the aciton is. We decided on this hotel because of it's great location and the amenities its website boasted about it. Not to mention the pictures looked awesome! But looks are definitely deceiving! I arrived a day after my cousin and grandmother and my cousin already had to be moved once to a different room because the air conditioner in her room broke! It was 95 degrees with 70% humidity so A/C was a must! Not to mention the broken light bulbs she found as well. The second room which I stayed in with her one night was down a long hallway with 4 rooms at the end. We shared a door with our neighbors who clearly did not know how to use their inside voices. They yelled at each other in Spanish at 12:30 in the morning and when we called to complain no one answered so I had to go downstairs myself. On the way down I got stuck in the elevator!! It just stopped and wouldn't budge! It was only stuck for a few minutes, but that was more than enough for me! Once the elevator finally let us out the front desk said I had to dial a number to file a complaint about noisy neighbors. All that for nothing!! So, by that point my grandmother had compiled a list of complaints to go talk to the front desk about. No A/C, no bathrobes, no newspaper as promised, etc. That's when we were moved again! And because we were on a time schedule every time we moved made us late to get somewhere, dinner, the theatre, etc. The new room seemed fine when we got there but we had to rush off to a play so we didn't get to spend much time in it. When we returned from the play to get ready for dinner my cousin spotted a LIVE ROACH running across the floor!!! She immediately killed it and once again we demanded to be moved....again! When a bell hop came up to give us our new room keys we asked if he was going to help us move, in which he replied, \"I wasn't told to but I can go get a cart and be back in 10 min.\" We said forget it because we were already late for dinner as it was. Upset, my grandmother asked him if he would like to take the roach with him and he snared at us and said,\"No, you can keep it.\" We all looked at each other in shock! He was so rude! Once we made it to the elevator lugging our belongings we saw the bell man standing there with the empty luggage cart!! He had it waiting down the hall the whole time, but refused to help us!! We couldn't believe it! Our last and final room was just like the rest, nothing special. Luckily it was our last night so we just grinned and bared it. Besides the snotty bell hop the other staff members were very polite and courteous to us.

I know it is NY and that you only get so much for your money, but the Sheraton NY Hotel & Towers is filled with easily correctable issues of mismanagement, that make stays there very frustrating. My advice: if you are on business, stay somewhere else; if you are staying for pleasure, consider another property, but don't completely rule this hotel out because it is such a great location for tourists. As a Platinum frequent guest I'm accustomed to being upgraded, but received a standard room (I have no issue with this...it is a perk based on availability). I do have a problem with poor housekeeping (prior guest's hair all over bathroom), rude housekeeping (maid knocks on and quickly opens door to room despite presence of do not disturb sign), toilet that is difficult to flush, toilet seat that will not stay up for a gentleman, broken lamp fixture next to bed, and a broken chain on a window blind (could not role the blind up or down) and for the 3 days of my stay maintenance did not even attempt to repair the blind despite my requests. Other problems include a very rude staff, especially on the phone when calling to \"guest services.\" Trying to get a supervisor on the phone at this property is a complete embarrassment to the Starwood chain as rude operators routinely forward you to voicemails in housekeeping and other unrelated departments rather than making any attempt to track-down a supervisor. My wrap-up: rude, unnecessary, easily fixable if the management of this hotel really cared...which they certainly do not seem to. I felt so strongly about my experiences that I have been trying to talk to the General Manager, Dan King, for over a week now just to alert the staff to some of the more egregious issues I had encountered so that they could better the guest experience. So far not so much as 1 returned call from anyone. OK, on the upside, just a few blocks north of Times Square the location is ideal for tourists. Further, nearly every subway line in Manhattan is a short walk from the front door. For breakfast skip the hotel and walk two blocks west to 9th Ave and find a good diner. I can't remember the name, but there is a good diner at the corner of 58th and 9th Ave, that is 1 block north and 2 blocks west.

We specifically requested adjoining rooms because of the children and were told if we requested a king for one room and 2 doubles for the other then the higher floors would accomodate that. I called back the day before to confirm we needed adjoining rooms but when we arrived they said that the rooms that were reserved said \"adjoining \" but they really weren't. So she changed us to another room and said they might be adjoining but she wasn't sure. She said there was nothing else they could do, unless we tried again for the next day. The room we got was a very small handicapped room with peeling paint on the outside wall and the desk light didn't work. We also couldn't get the window drapes to close for my 2 yr old to take a nap (and they had previously been pulled partly off the track) and finally found - much later - a switch to automatically close them that the bell hop didn't tell us about. They were NOT adjoining rooms, nor were they on a high floor like the reservationist said. My husband complained to someone else at the desk a while later and they said they had adjoining rooms available to move to right away, so we moved all our luggage to the new rooms. The new rooms were much better - at least they did adjoin - but only with 2 double beds, no king as we were told. The wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom and some of the tiles were broken. with holes. The room appeared pretty old but the bed and sheets were nice and the shower was OK. The curtains did pull close. Obviously the location is great with the subway right around the corner and Times Square an easy walk - but for about $465 per night (with tax ) per room it was a very shoddy old small room with very impersonal service.

Plenty room, and king-size bed SO comfy.Room was cleaned and towels etc replaced regularly. I also spent time at the gym which is well equipped and supervised. We booked the bus tour through the staff at the hotel, who were very informative and recommended certain trips and things to do. They also have an extensive list of recommended eateries, though we enjoyed \"Rosie O'Gradys\" (opposite) and \"Maxies\" (same side heading towards Times Square). The bar staff at night were fun and also recommend things to see and do.Our departure was also eased by the staff organising our shuttle bus to the airport and also, with help,...that was offered,you can check-in and progress your flights from the computers available at reception. Yes it was a very busy and vibrant hotel, but standards were to a high value. And,lets face it, when you're visiting New York who is going to spend heaps of time at an hotel when there is so much to do in the city?! We walked a great deal (best way to experience New York life), though bus tour was great to find where everything was located.... and the guides are fun and informative.

I've stayed in this Sheraton numerous times over many years. Overall understand it's a massive hotel - thousands of rooms - thus it is frequented by conventions, class trips, tour groups etc. The large lobby can be chaos or very quiet - you never know what you'll get at any given time due to the size of this hotel. It's location also factors in to crowds due to it's location in mid-town/Times Square/theatre district. That being said - this is a plus if these area's are what you are seeking. No doubt, location is a short walk to the Great White Way, more restaurants than you can count (both fast food/deli's and local places, as well as restaurant row). Central park is within blocks, as is Rockefeller Center amd Fifth Ave shopping. With this central mid-town location all subway lines are also within blocks (with C, E, N, R) right outside the hotel. Over the last five years this hotel underwent renovations, mainly to the lobby/convention areas - but also throughout the rooms on numerous floors. Ask when you book or check in...certainly some rooms have not be updated other than new carpeting etc and bedding, and a cosmetic do-over in the bath. Some floors are completely upgraded. I am a Starwood member and have been given all types, it works to ask if your room is updated - and they usually accomodate if space allows. Just this last weekend I was in a queen room on the 12th floor, about average size in NYC for a queen room - and it had a upgraded bed, it was clean, but certainly had dated furniture (all perfectly functional). Some towels were a bit on the thin side where others were thick and fluffy. Bath was updated - but as expected workmanship on these massive renovations can be average at best if you expect all the tiles to line up perfectly, and the grout to be perfect. Bath was very clean and shower pressure and shower head were excellent. Amenities were fine ( I like the mint & tangerine products). I have been lucky(?) I guess in not getting the moldy or chipped doors shown in some pics on previous reviewers - and quite honestly for the price of these rooms in NYC there is no way I'd settle for that. I'm reasonable - but some of those pics are beyond what you should ever expect from a Sheraton - so don't. There are millions of rooms in this city and this mid-town location gets it's price - even for preferred members on special member discount offerings. If all else fails - head one block down to the massive Hilton on 6th; it's never booked to capacity and I've never, ever seen rooms that looked like that there - and the pricing is comparible even less so, on rack rate even. Of the numerous times I have stayed at this Sheraton, the accomodations have been clean and respectable - even sometimes, - very nice (for a newer updated king room). Felt for the location and price it was as usual in NYC. You can also check out the usually lower (a bit) price and smaller Sheraton Manhattan next door which is still undergoing updating - that's another option - pretty much the same quality. Eat out - don't go to the hotel restaurants (if you do expect nothing better than less than average at best), especially in this area there are 24 hour choices that abound within walking distance in all directions. Few added info: Self checkin-check out avaiable Good workout facility, more machines than the average Luggage storage is up to $3.50/per bag Parking garage next to hotel and has direct entrance to hotel Not all rooms have new widescreen TV's (if that's important) Safe in room (not big enough for laptops) If you don't do the subway (it's fine, really...) taxi's in this area abound out front. P.S. The staff here seem perfectly fine - remember this is NYC and support staff aren't always tourist ambassadors, some are more welcoming or attentive than others.

The entrance or 'lobby' is really amazing - you feel like royalty as you step in, I don't know if I just haven't stayed in many hotels so don't know what to expect, but it really was impressive. When we checked in, we requested a room that was high up so we could have a good view of New York, and no problem, this was granted. Our room was absolutely fantastic, with a great big window overlooking Times Square : ) It really was amazing to look out and to open the window and hear the sound of New York city, then close it and have complete silence. We had a great big bed and it was the comfiest bed we have ever slept in, we had to force ourselves to get out of it! There was also a lovely bathroom, a desk with tea, etc, (and Sheraton pens and notepads!) and lots of space. The maid service was brilliant and we had New York papers left outside our door every morning free of charge. Unfortunately, we really chose the wrong time to go to New York, as it was absolutely freezing, and there is honestly no way I can communicate to you how cold it was - I was crying one day because it was so painful! Everyone had warned us but you think 'yeah, yeah, it's only a bit of cold' but seriously it was excrutiatingly cold! New York is absolutely amazing, it really is - there's so much to see and do, and Times Square is alive all the time, but I would recommend to anyone that is visiting to go at a warmer time of year, when you can really take it all in and not have to keep running inside away from the cold! On a plus note to the weather, the cold really made us appreciate the hotel. When we went back after a long day in the snow, nothing felt better than entering the warm reception area and retiring to our room and the comfy bed. Although TImes Square is noisy, you cannot hear it at all with the window shut, so nothing kept us from sleeping soundly in our queen size bed : ) What makes this hotel so brilliant is the location - you are right slap bang in the middle of the action, you can never get bored in Times Square, and everything you want to see is just a walk or bus ride away. It is truly fantastic. Also, this hotel has a real sense of luxury, there's nothing cheap and nasty, just pure bliss. Well I think you can clearly see that I adored this hotel, so what were the bad points? Well there's often a queue for one of the many lifts (or should I say 'elevators')... but really you can't moan about that, just go up the stairs or wait 2 minutes for it to come! I can't fault this hotel at all. I have never been to America before so I didn't know what to expect, and I am never usually the sort to go back to places because I like to try new places and hotels - but if I were to go back to New York (which I most certainly plan to - I fell in love with the city, but my boyfriend says we can't go back for a few years else we won't appreciate it!) I would definitely stay in the Sheraton Hotel and Towers. I would recommend it to anyone. Also, if you have not been to New York, you will find the people charming - really polite : )", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethel, CT", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth the Money\u201d", "Author": "bethel66", "ReviewID": "UR14689177", "Content": "My husband and I wanted to get away for a night for our anniversary.

Not fabulous, not excellent. We chose this hotel for the location and because the place we normally stay across the street from it has raised their prices and offers only a slightly better room. The hotel location is great because we could walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue for shopping, Rockefeller Center, Times Square and the Theatre District. Check-in was fast and friendly. The valet parking experience was a little scary because they were totally overwhelmed and we had to leave our car sitting in the driveway leading up to the main area. At check- out, it took a half hour for our car to be brought around and I heard others in the valet waiting area complaining about waiting 35 or 40 minutes. Our room was OK. The bed and pillows were comfortable. There was an uncovered electrical socket and someone travelling with a child would probably want to call the front desk, but we weren't concerned. The room was plain, and the carpets need a good cleaning. The desk area was nice and if we were traveling on business we would appreciate it. The toilet made some crazy noises after it was flushed, kind of loud, but eventually calmed down after giggling the handle a bit. The public hallways also need a good vacuuming. I saw the vacuums being used by housekeeping and they looked very old and suitable for a household, not a busy hotel. The hotel has a bar called The Library and we stopped in after a show for a drink and the bartender was just plain rude. We were at a small table and no one came over to wait on us so we went to the bar with our request and he refused to help us and told us to wait for our server at our table. He was quite rude in his tone and demeanor. Overall, for the price, it was a decent place to stay.

However the next day a huge tour party checked in and people were queued down the lobby. The room on the 15th floor had very tired decor but everything was clean and tidy. The air conditioning unit looks like it has been there since the hotel was first built and it wasn't working. I called down the next morning and the Sheraton had sorted it out by the time I came back to the room, along with a follow up courtesy call. The corridor noise comes right through the door and at 2am I really didn't appreciate some extra loud hotel patrons screaming down to their friends. The lifts can take awhile on the lower floors. My colleagues on the floors above 30th had a better experience in terms of corridor noise and lift frequency. We usually had breakfast across the road in a little Italian deli which was efficient and friendly. We also ate in the following local places: Topaz Thai - 56th Street. Very small and intimate. Good service. Very busy. Russian Tea Rooms - pricey. We ordered tea and an excellent dessert. Friendly service. Stange ambience. Trattoria Dell'arte - 7th Ave and 57th St. The pizzas are great. However service is a little sloppy. They seem a little thin on the ground with staff. Hilton/Etrusca - 53rd Street. This was actually OK considering we got caught in a torrential downpour as we left the Sheraton on the way to another restaurant so ended up running into Etrusca. They were accomodating and sorted out some nice wine and food for us. This is a great location if you want to do touristy stuff as you are only 10 blocks from Times Square and 8 or so blocks from Central Park. In terms of business trips the 'executive lounge' is closed at the weekends which was difficult . I was there on a business trip with a group so had to decamp to each other's hotel rooms at the weekend to have work discussions.

For other travelers. Upside: Really great location, around the corner is the subway station and it is not noisy on the 7th Av comparing to the walking distance of other hotels at Times Square so that you can have a much better sleep at night. If you're time lacking in NY and want to sight see a lot of places, Sheraton NY is a great choice (based on just location-wise rather than rooms/ view). I was glad in last minute I chose Sheraton but not Millennium basically because of the location. Millennium is great but you have to walk a few blocks from subway if you're not planning to take a cab. Beautiful lobby and great staff at the reception. Helen and Ahmed I met there were very professional and helpful, warm and very polite. They tried to accommodate my need as much as possible and Helen provided me immediate check-in when I reached the hotel that day just before noon. If you don't want to pay for your internet access in your room, go down to the lobby and it has free WiFi there available. View is not great but just okay (at least there is a city view, I wonder if there is any below 25th floor). Staying at 3408 I can only see the top of radiocity music hall but I can't see rockefeller centre or other landmarks. Downside: Room is NOT impressive at all when Sheraton should be considered somehow as a 4-star hotel. Those really simple decorations and furnitures reveal their time. They shouldn't use dark brown furnitures which give an impression of being outdated. Don't expect large room (I think it's general in NY) and it's indeed a bit squeeze for 2 persons in the room. Toilet is small as well. No free internet access in your room. No fridge and slipper available in your room. Probably one of the very few 4-star hotels that don't accommodate with these basic things. Sheraton hotels in Asia are much better. TV is kinda horrible. Looks like 80s and screen quality is bad with 'snow flakes'. Anyway as I don't come to NY to watch TV so that didn't bother me much. In general it's a good place to stay (just slightly less than US$200 per night including tax).

Nevertheless, what happened to me and my partner on a recent stay there was unacceptable: we decided to make a short (9 minutes) International phone call to the UK shortly after our check-in at 3pm, then left the hotel for sightseeing. When we returned at 8pm, the phone indicated three new messages, all from the reception staff politely asking to come down to reception to pay the phone charges, either cash or by credit cards. This came quite as a suprise as we did not plan to check out until the following day. So we decided to ignore the request for the moment and to enjoy our stay in NYC. Two minutes later the phone rang and an angry receptionist shouted in the phone that we have to pay the phone charges straight away. She requested our credit card details. We enquired the balance and refused to provide any details after hearing the ridiculous amoung of US $ 111 for a 9-minute phone call to a landline in the UK. The woman on the phone was rude, claimed that we made two phone calls (we only just entered the room) and probably assumed that we suffered from disabled hearing as she nearly screamed in the phone. We couldn't believe to be treated with such disrespect as paying customers and just disembarking from a Cunard cruise with QM2. I requested to speak to her manager, who displayed not only rudeness but also arrogance and attitude problems. I told her that we only made one phone call and that the amount can not be correct. After a few minutes of discussion she suddenly claimed that we have to pay 82$. I said that this is not the correct amount and that we only made one short phone call. She waffled and talked nonsense about charges for International calls, raising her voice until she finally reduced the balance to 51US$. Nevertheless, she demanded that I went down to reception straight away to settle the room bill (it was after 8pm). I refused to do so as I am not accustomed to being treated like a criminal. We stayed in the 33rd floor. At this point I gave her a lecture on respect for hotel guests, her attitude problems and her general lack of suitable training for this job. She responded by shouting something about \"I note the feedback but I am the front desk manager and you to come down now\" into the phone and hung up. Five minutes later a man from the hotel phoned and stated that his front desk manager told him we refuse to pay our phone charges, a statement which was far away from the truth. We simply don't tolerate attitude problems of hotel staff and I told him that. He seemed to co-operate and agreed that we can settle our bill the next day whilst checking out.

For the most part the staff was enthusiastic and was very prompt to fulfill our requests. Execpt for the man who checked us in and made it rather clear to me that he was extending to me a great favor. Rude & Arrogant! Upon arrival, a doorman named Marcus rushed to our car and as my driver had already popped the trunk he lifted a suitcase out and slammed it shut, put it on his dolly and started walking away leaving my driver in the street holding my husbands belongings. We called him back and the driver said we had more and he said \"no...trunk is empty\". We found out an hour later he was wrong and my suitcase with all my medicines was back in NJ. Was this an isolated incident? perhaps...but the inconvenience of having our driver return to the city with my things was very upsetting to me. Guest services was upset as well and said they would look into this and give me a $50 credit on our bill for our inconvenience. By the end of our stay I stopped calling guest services b/c I felt I would be deemed \"a pest\". We were traveling with friends and had 3 rooms in the hotel. Ours was #2720. Next to the electrical closet and various houskeeping rooms. I think my biggest complaint was that for 3 nights I had to walk past dirty dishes, rollaways and houskeeping carts to get to my room. It seems that they store things in that corridor. Our main light was out in our room upon arrival, but was fixed within 30 minutes of the bellman notifying housekeeping. There were 2 of us staying in the room and we had 3 towels, 1 washcloth and 2 smaller towels. The eletrical outlet in the bathroom did not work. The room was adequate but dowdy and had the room for but no chair to sit in other than a rickety desk chair. At least our room did not have holes in the wall as did our friends. We did not ask to be moved because our friends who did ask were given quite a runaround and ended up staying in the hotel one whole day waiting for it to happen...which it never did.

They respect the business traveller and are willing to go the extra step to help the pleasure traveller. I had an opportunity to interact with the concierge. He was extremely helpful. The most important thing to me was that he listened to me. I explained the type of restauraunt I was looking for and he gave me options and to my surprise had menus available. Directions were clear and it never seemed a bother for any of the staff. The seemed ready and willing to make my stay comfortable and hassle free. The room was great.

Fortunately, when we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the worst. The hotel itself sits in a great location, close to Times Square, Central Park, Radio City, and Rockefellar center. The lobby was very nice, in my opinion. We had a king bed, and the room was actually bigger than what was described in previous reviews. It's certainly not your typical sized hotel room, but we didn't feel cramped at all. The bathroom was small and not much room to store your toiletries, etc. There was a little dust on the wood blinds, as previously reported - I didn't think that was a big deal. We were on the 37th floor and had views of other tower buildings which was not bad. As reported, the beds at the Sheraton are very comfortable and the linens were placed on the bed correctly. The only problem we had was the heater. When it was on, it really pumped out the heat to the point where we had to just turn it off. The hotel sent someone up to fix it, but he stated he couldn't because all of the heaters run that way, even on low. The hallways, in my opinion, didn't appear dark and dingy as previously reported. There were some scuff marks on the walls, but I might not have noticed them had I not read those reviews. Overall, this is a nice hotel in an old building that requires some updating on air conditioning/heating system and the hallways.

We tried the Stage Deli both mornings for breakfast, which was great. The pizza restaurant one door up from Letterman was very very good. We tried room service for dinner one evening and that was really great! Ordered a burger for me, soup and a salad for my wife, and a bottle of wine. It was with us in less than 20 minutes and was brought on a fold-up table with white table cloth, which was really great and quite good value, considering. The food was really tasty! Had a few drinks in the Library Bar in the lobby and that was a great chance to do some people-watching. Service was friendly and efficient. So, I have no problems recommending this to other first-time visitors to NYC. There may well be better hotels with nicer rooms but all in all the Sheraton was fine by us.", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "King of Prussia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "phillyrx", "ReviewID": "UR10471816", "Content": "As I start all my reviews, a 5 is hard to get. It's reserved for those that exceed expectations. With that said, this Sheraton was average. I've stayed at a lot better Sheratons, but with that, this is New York City... what else can you expect? The location: You can't beat the location. It's located near basically everything. If that's not enough, it's just a few blocks from the subway to get wherever you need to go. The service: I booked the hotel with my starwood points so that helped. Overall, the front desk and concierge were helpful in assisting us. I asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid the outside noise, and they put us on the 27th floor... not shabby. The room: After reading a lot of the other reviews, I feel like people are expecting a lot when paying such outrageous prices for these hotel rooms in NYC. Being that I've stayed in many NY hotels, I've come to accept the fact that they are probably the smallest hotel rooms in the world. If you're looking for a big room, don't stay in NY, unless you're willing to shell out a lot of $$$$. With that to preface, the room was a decent size. The only thing on the small side was the bathroom, but as before, this should be expected. The decor was worn and a little outdated, but overall not bad. Personally, I think it was an average hotel room for a NYC hotel. Besides, when going to NY, who spends all their time in the room? Overall: I'd stay here again, but only because of Starwood points. I would not recommend shelling out $500ish to stay here for a night. There are better alternatives at that price range. If you can get it on priceline or hotwire for $250 or so, it's an okay deal. All in all, it's not a bad hotel, but it isn't spectacular either... thus, the average review.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cairo", "Title": "\u201cA pethetic hotel at best\u201d", "Author": "shadytawfik", "ReviewID": "UR10468693", "Content": "This hotel is an absolute dump at best, i mean i can't describe how shabby and dirty the rooms even though the location is good.

TRNSPORTATION: The hotel was about a 40 minute drive from La Guardia airport at 5pm and the taxi cost us $45 including the toll. It was only $30 to go back to the airport at 530 am so the traffic can make a huge difference in your fares. They also advised us we could take the train or a hotel shuttle bus but a taxis was more convenient for us. It was very easy to get a taxi from this hotel and many times they were linedup right outside so that was a benefit. LOCATION: The Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers has a great location at 7th Ave and 53rd Street and is directly across the street from the Sheraton Manhattan. You are a short walk to central park one direction and time square in the other direction. We did a lot of walking from this hotel as the area was safe and very convenient. CHECK IN: staff was excellent and very quick. I had 2 reservations 1 for the 1st 3 nights and another for the last 2 nights and they were able to accomodate us by keeping us in the same room and we did not have to check out and back in. That was great and very helpful. All of the staff was friendly and always there to help. ROOMS: we had a traditional room with 2 double beds on a \"high floor\" which they say costs more money but I could not see a price difference between the rates when I booked. The room was very small (typical for New York) but not very well lit or overly clean for a Sheraton. The coffee cups were dirty and we had to call for new clean ones, which were very prompt. We wanted to rent a movie one night but the movie guide was not available and it took 3 calls and 2 days to get a guide (the guide in the TV did not list the times so we needed a seperate guide). One morning one of our towels, that had been replaced the day before as a clean one, was dirty when we took it off the shelf. The room temperature was also hard to control as it was either really really hot or very cold not really a happy medium especially during the night when trying to sleep. The room cost us about $600 per night including the taxes so I expected the size of the room to be small but I also did expect it to be clean. We were on the 34th floor and it was very noisey, you could hear the doors of other rooms sqeaky open and closed and slam. We had about a 1/4 inch gap all the way around the door in our room so we could always make our way to the bathroom in the dark as it lit up the whole room. The walls are very thin so you can hear all the noise from outside and one night we listened to the guest next door on a conference call and we could make out the whole call very clearly. FACILITIES: The gym at the hotel was very nice with lots of up to date equiptment and never seemed really busy so that was a bonus. Room service was very quick and efficient and the food was good. Tickets fopr a variety of attractions could also be purchased from this hotel as well. They do have an ATM machine on the main floor but it is down a hallway and around a corner and a little hard to find but it is there. FOOD: There are lots of great restaurants in the area so the hotel pricing is not too bad due to the abundance of competition. Basically walk out the front door and look in any direction to find tons od bistros, fine dining, diners, sandwichs shops etc. Some of the best are within a few blocks of this hotel. Ask the concierge or front desk what they recommend as there is something for every palate.

This was over a holiday weekend and our shuttle driver said it was a bit busier than normal. There was no line at check in and the desk personal were very friendly and helpful. I had called the night before just to be sure that our reservation was in place. We were given a room on the 36th floor and directed to the elevators. Total check in time was less than 5 minutes. As we made our way to the room I remembered some of the other reviews about the elevators. We waited about 30 seconds for an elevator and were taken right up to our floor. Over our entire stay I would say our longest elevator wait was Monday morning during Labor day check out. We must have waited about 5 minutes. All the other times we had elevators either waiting in the lobby or arriving within a minute or two. The hallways on our floor were were never vacuumed during our stay. Lots of small bits of paper and trash, nothing large or obnoixious. The room was a bit larger than I expected given all the reviews I had read and the complaints about size. We had two queen beds. The bathroom was small but not to0 tight. The room was clean but this hotel is showing it's age. It's been a while since it was updated and it's getting a bit long in the tooth. The beds were great! Really liked them. Being up high reduce outside noise considerably. Neighbor noise was not to bad. My only gripe, and this applies to all hotels, is the people who come it at 2:00AM in the morning and shout to each other down the hall. It sure wakes you up if you are a light sleeper. We never ate in the hotel so I can't say what the food or it's costs would have been. We had two issues with the room all were addressed one was not fixed. The tube/show faucet had a very steady leak. More than just a drip. We called the front desk on Monday and a repair person came up within an hour. He must have spent an hour working on the problem, he got the flow reduced but not fixed. He said he would have to come back the following morning and ask when we would be out. We said after 9:00AM. When we returned on Tuesday we still had the drip so I don't know if they came back or not. Also on Tuesday morning the lamp between our beds stopped working. I called the front desk and a repair person was up within 10 minutes. He thought all we needed was a bulb. He took the lamp off the wall and said he we have it fixed before we returned for the day. Which he did and we had no more issues with the lamp. Interesting thing was Wednesday when we returned we still had the drip but we had a new shower head. Could never quite figure that out. At checkout I told the desk clerk at checkout our issue sbut he did not seem to be writing anything down. He did offer us a free breakfast but we had already eaten. Again checkout was quick. Only one person in line ahead of us and two people working the counter. We did use the concierge once for a dinner reservation. Wait to talk with her was about 2 minutes. Very friendly and helpful. She recommended a resturant near by. Service was great, food was OK. It was Azelas right next to the Gershwin theater where Wicked was playing. Not a bad place but my first stay in downtown New York in over 20 years.

The feel of the busy lobby is that of one of those hotels that caters to groups from other countries and airline crews. Many different languages are being spoken and there is a lot of hustle and bustle. The room was exactly as depicted on the hotels websight. It was clean and equipped with the usual basics (soap, shampoo, moisturizer, ice bucket, glasses, etc.) and little more. The carpet and bathroom were clean with plenty of towels. My room was quiet the entire night and the elevators were fast and usually empty on this Friday evening (I made several trips out of the hotel for food, cruise supplies, etc.). Security officers were on duty to check room key at the elevator lobby. The bed was among the best of any hotel and the bottom sheet fit and went all of the way to the bottom of the mattress. The comforter was nice and fluffy. The air conditioner was adequate and kept the room cool. The ice machine worked and was behind a big thick door. The gym was well-equipped.

This wasn't too inconvenient, but sometimes it was hard to find a place to sit in the lobby due to everyone else hanging out with their laptops! Probably the biggest problem we had was checking out- they were unable to give us even an hour extension on check-out time, so we were forced to check our luggage with the bell-hop. Be forewarned that this service is NOT free, as it is in most other hotels of this caliber (and even other Sheratons I've stayed at)- you have to pay $3 per bag. It's not too much money, but we still felt it was unacceptable given our situation. We spoke with someone at the front desk and he gave us a comp voucher to pay for our stored luggage (after just a little bit of cajoling). So it all worked out in the end, but was a little frustrating at the time. Overall, the hotel itself was nice and the staff did at least try to help us with any issues that arose.

However, we later found that there were a number of good cafes within seconds of the hotel and that most other guests at the hotel had opted to eat there instead.

On to the stay... My son (19) and I arrived on Friday moorning 7/27 at 10:30 am. There had to have been 300 teenage girls in the lobby for the International Modeling and Talet competition that the hotel was hosting. From reading previous reviews it seems like this is a weekly occurance for this Sheraton. My advice is to ask before booking and if they are having it..RUN!! This was the most obnoxious, loud, group of people I have ever run into.There was also a dance competition going on..they weren't as bad. The beauty queens monopolized the lobby day and night. Plopping on the floor wherever they wanted too-bringing in takeout food to eat in the lobby, running(I mean actually RUNNING) through the lobby barefoot. If you have seen the movie Little Miss Sunshine, you'll know what I mean. They hotel staff was very friendly to us and there was alot of \"eye-rolling\" going on- they couldn't be;ieve it either. I did hear one front desk clerk scold a teenager who was loud and obnoxious- I wanted to applaud! We were able to get into our rooms at about 11:00 when my husband arrived. It was very smooth. The room was small for 3 but we didn't care- the rollaway was full size and delivered immediately. Bathroom as stated was very small. We'd leave the hotel at 9 am back at 5 leave again at 7 and come back for bed. Forget the Starbucks int he lobby- again monopolized by the kids. Like I said - for a freebie it was awesome- if I had to pay $350/night- I wouldn't be happy.

We drove from DC to NY, which takes about 5 hours max. It doesn't make sense to take the Amtrak trains anymore because the prices have become prohibitive (~$300 round trip vs. $50 for gas). We checked in around 9 p.m. When we entered the room, we noticed that the bath products were used plus there was a razor in the tub. The staff sent someone to clean the bathroom but then we noticed that the bed looked lumpy and that there were some wire hangers teetering from a lamp. We had a couple of theories about how it got that way (some not so appropriate for this board), so we just asked for a new room. The new room was on the 9th floor. It was clean and the bathroom was fine. Everybody talks about tiny NYC rooms but we think nothing of it. Nearly all rooms in NYC are tiny, it's just the way it is. Anyway, the hotel is really close to Times Square so we headed out for a walk and the city streets were packed. The queue for the Harry Potter book at Toys r Us was amusing, there was literally a big swell that rushed in when the clock struck midnight. We also picked up a snack at one of the delis nearby. Delis close to Time Square and the hotel were pricey, so go off a few blocks. Saturday morning breakfast was a couple blocks over at Metro Cafe, same stuff as Lindy's but less expensive. We walked around the city, had high tea at Cafe Pierre (very pricey--expect to pay $50++ per person), looked at the new fall bags on Fifth Ave., heard Mass at St. Paddy's, and had dinner at Oh! Taisho in the East Village. (Super excellent if you like Japanese food. Inexpensive too.) On Sunday, a couple of blocks on 7th Ave. were closed for a street fair, which was lots of fun. According to the vendors, they had to jack up their prices a bit for that one because of the higher rent for the location, but there is generally a street fair every Sunday somewhere in the city. We had a late checkout, so our bags stayed in our room until 3 p.m. We tried to put or bags in storage, but because this was a pre- and post-cruise hotel, their storage area was packed and they had to use one of the ballrooms for the baggage. The queue was pretty long. So be prepared to wait for your baggage getting in and out. Overall, a great NYC trip. We try to visit the city about three times a year, mainly because we have city envy (the 24 hour bodegas, cheap mani-pedis, and great restos are nowhere to be found in DC).

You wouldn't want to be in Times Square. Way to busy. But to see it from the front door of your hotel is the way to go. \"Maison\" french restaurant across the street is too good to describe in words. Open air dining with ambiance galore and food that makes me salivate just thinking about it. I like healthy food and there is an organic food market very close to the hotel. Delis nearby made me custom salads every day with organic avocados and fruit from the market. David Letterman Show (FREE tickets to show M-F) one block away. Broadway Theatre with \"The Color Purple\" starring Fantasia one block away. Many theatres within 2-3 short blocks. Subway to Penn station less than one block. GORGEOUS lobby, fast elevators and friendly staff. What more can I say? The rooms were clean as a whistle, the gym stocked with (I counted) 16 brand new Life Fitness machines plus free weights. Best gym I've ever seen in a Hotel. Business center FED Ex'd and custom wrapped a piece of art I purchased. Would I stay at the Shereton again? You betcha!! Hint: Come to NYC via Newark airport. Take the Airtrain to the New Jersey Transit (FREE) then take the New Jersey Transit to Penn Station ($15). It's relaxing and takes less than 30 minutes. (Cab is at least $60 and an hour and a half commute to the city near rush hour). I've done both and the train is the way to go. From Penn Station take the uptown subway to the hotel.

Check in was a breeze - very friendly guy, told us that the one room was ready, but we'd have to wait until 3 pm for the other. No problem, Jimmy, the bellhop took all our bags to the one room, and stayed with us for a few minutes to tell us which bars and restaurants in the area had the best prices and terrific food. The one thing I will say, is that the bathrooms (both of them) had very \"tired\" wallpaper, the hallways could use new wallpaper - looks like luggage had been bounced off them on many occasions. Otherwise the rooms were fine. Not as small as many people had complained, water pressure was great, beds were extremely comfortable and a fantastic view from the 28th floor - all the way up to central park! The staff was always friendly and very helpful - printing out copies of directions for us to give to the taxis drivers, looking up informtion on particular stores we wanted to check out, and helping answer questions about the costs of cab rides from point A to B. Starbucks in the lobby was a lifesaver. Drinks at the hotel bar at the end of the night, were fantastic. Everything was great - and I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to stay there again. Maybe all the people that whined haven't travelled enough to really know what a small room is (we stayed in Little Korea last year, and there was barely enough room to walk around the ONE bed in the room).

We made repeated attempts to get security to do something about it... of course noone came up for a while and they didn't manage to control anything in the end - despite the fact that the kids were either drunk or on drugs and beyond loud, running up and down the halls. All very disturbing and upsetting to anyone trying to get a few hours of sleep. Even the lobby, during Christmas had nothing to look at. Simply no effort is made. Avoid ANY food in this hotel. The only plus side to our experience was a voucher a very nice manager gave us to spend at the hotel (since no adjustments can be made to priceline reservations). We made the huge mistake of spending it for breakfast at the hotel- our $26 a person buffet was the worst I've had in my life. Still, cheers to the nice manager, the only person who tried to make things a bit better for us after many a mishap. I would not stay here unless I got it on Priceline for under 100.

I went back down to reception to get a new room, explaining the heating was broken. After more barking, I finally got a new room, which was just as dated and aged and smelly. There were even some white stains on the bed covers. I asked the maid to change these. 4 nights later, the bed sheets were still there and not being replaced. I was really disgusted. The room also for some reason began to smell horridly during the night - the fumes would wake me up. It was mainly food smells probably coming up through the air con pipes. Really horrid. The decor in the hotel is aged and the rooms are small and offer no luxury at all. I really felt I was being overcharged - they charge extra for the gym, too. Finally, the staff are SO rude. Except for the guys at the door who get you cabs etc, the check in staff and everyone else was being absolutely rude and unfriendly and made me feel unwelcome. Worst customer service I've experienced in a hotel - by far. I recommend staying at On The Ave, a fab boutique hotel in a much better location.", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBetter off at HoJo; Will stick to Ritz Carlton\u201d", "Author": "fatefullotus", "ReviewID": "UR6711278", "Content": "Our problems, in short: 1-- check-in kiosk ate credit card.

I did probably 3 months of reading these online reviews and researching all the discount package sites (we needed air + hotel) and with a lump in my throat, pushed the \"purchase vacation package\" button on the hotels.com site. Basically I feel pretty safe in saying that if you averaged all the reviews of this hotel, you will find the truth. It wasn't spectacular but it wasn't horrible either. However, I would be much more upset with my experience had I payed more than we did for the hotel. We ended up paying about $120/night (maybe a little more). Here's the rundown: 39th Floor -- rooms 3915 and 3928 (opposite sides of the hall from one another) 1. It's true -- DON'T EAT NEAR THE HOTEL!!!!! Coming from Texas where the cost of living is SIGNIFICANTLY lower than that of Manhatten, we were expecting the worst...however, prices are not bad if you venture 1 to 2 streets over (in any direction) from the hotel. We made the mistake of eating at the Friday's located on the corner near the hotel and my husband and I split a $17 hamburger and fries. Considering that a few streets over we ate a DELICIOUS gourmet Italian dinner later that night for around $20 to $22 / person at Cara Mia, it seems to be a bit of a rip off. 2. Don't expect a mysterious upgrade to the \"Club Level.\" Didn't happen for us. I don't know what the other travelers (so many it seemed) did to receive this mysterious upgrade, but it wasn't in the cards for us. 3. The people are plenty nice at the hotel. I didn't encounter one rude person and in fact, they were quite accommodating (except for not upgrading us to Club Level). We left the maid $2 every day and always had AMPLE amounts of towels and fresh toilettries. Our room was kept up neatly and I didn't notice dust on anything (but then again, I don't even dust my own house!) 4. We arrived and were told (when we asked if there was any way we could upgrade to Club Level) that not only could we not upgrade but that we were in 2 \"very smally rooms.\" The check-in Lady told us that she suggested we come back after 2:00 pm to see if they had any other rooms available. They tood our luggage to the luggage room and stored them for $3/bag (that's a flat fee per day). That's when we encountered the $17 hamburger. Upon our return they had 2 \"Deluxe\" rooms available for us on the 39th floor. All I have to say is that if our rooms were \"Deluxe\" I would hate to see what they were going to put us in! They weren't bad but I definitely wouldn't describe them as \"Deluxe.\" They were smaller but not terrible. My husband is a Large man -- 6'5'' and about 300 lbs and we had plenty of room for us and our things. The bathroom IS tiny. There's no getting around that. And if you are sitting on the potty and forgot to shut the door -- forget about it...that puppy's staying open for the duration. Some tiles in the tub were a little yucky -- grout missing, some discoloration in grout -- stuff you would think they would take the 10 minutes that it would take to repair it. BUT the nastiest thing we encountered the whole time was a splattering of dried bloody snot on the shower curtain. YIKES! Our potty starting going out (as I have read in many reviews) around the 2nd day of our stay. They were always prompt in responding to our calls, but we did have to call on three separate occasions. That was a TAD annoying. It is true -- there is no way to switch from AC to Heat. If they hotel is set on Heat, that's what you get. We are warm natured and so opened the window and slept nicely until around 6:00 am the following morning. Street noise became too much at that point and we had to close it. The next night we requested a fan and one was promptly brought up to us, no charge. ALL CALLS are charged to your room -- local or toll free. I thought I was playing it safe by using my toll free calling card but got stuck with a $24 bill at the end of our stay. Oh well. Shouldn't forgotten the cell in Texas! The beds are comfortable. They also give you 4 pillows, 2 each of different firmnesses. They were sleepable (I am a pillow snob and I handled it). There was wear on the room I couldn't remember seeing in other hotels back in Texas that are supposedly on the same star rating -- paint was chipped and missing on the closet doors in lots of places as well as the bathroom door and door jam. The wallpaper was beginning to creep up at the seams in many spots. BUT all in all, we were gone everyday from 8:00 am until past midnight so it was fine for our purposes. There weren't any foul smells...carpet wasn't torn. Didn't try to use our safe so I can't speak to that issue. LOCATION: This hotel is GREAT for location!!! It truly is centrally located and we found it very easy to get to all the attractions we visited and utilized the subway quite a lot. TRANSPORATION: We bought a $24 unlimited Subway Metro Card each that would have lasted 7 days. The subways are pretty easy to navigate and we got the hang of it pretty quickly. We flew in from LaGuardia and the Taxi ride from the Airport to the hotel was like $36 dollars (and vice versa). Tips for your travel: be nice to others and they will be nice to you. Not everyone is always nice when you are nice however as we found a couple of times from people serving us. But all in all, most everyone we encountered was very amiable. Especially a man working in a Bari's Pizza ( I believe on West 72nd street -- we were looking for the Seinfeld apartment facade)...he treated us like we were ROYALTY...which was ironic as it was one of the least expensive meals we ate while there! Would I stay at this hotel again if I went to NYC again? I don't think so. I would give another establishment a whirl. It wasn't that impressive keeping in mind that there are so many options.

That said, I thought this place was really bad and actually sort of gross. I stayed here last weekend because it was the site of a conference I was attending. I'd stayed the year before and had not been impressed then, and so did not have high expectations. (Last year, I had a room at the end of the hall, so it only connected on one side, and there was little traffic going by the room as a result, the point of which will be explained below) But the hotel was even worse than I remembered this go around. I had a room with two double beds, which the front desk said was larger than the rooms with Queen beds. But the room was very small with the two beds, a night table and built in desk literally squeezed into the small space available. That was no big deal, but the room was just run down - stained carpet; beat up walls; black mildew stains in the shower (that's gross). I assumed the bedspreads were no better (dirty), but the bedspread is the only blanket on the bed, and to dispense with it, you'd be left with just a sheet. Even all this I could have overlooked, but the unbelievable noise couldn't be. This is the loudest hotel I've ever stayed in. The walls between the rooms were paper thin and the conversations in the rooms next door were audible in my room. Worse than that though, the sound of doors closing in the hallway outside; the sound of doors closing in adjacent rooms (bathroom door; closet door) was unbelieveably loud, and really irritating. Although it was wicked cold out at night, I left the window open so the sound of the street outside to block out the noise of people and closing doors. The lobby is really nice and the lobby bar (the Library, I think it was called) was a very comfortable and relaxing place to have a drink. But none of that comfort and relaxation extended to the room. Even if the seminar I go to each year is here again, I'm staying somewhere else.

We found a great deal on tickets to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular so we book the show. This was on November 7th. I then looked for a hotel on the 8th. We found quite a few locations with the least expensive around $329 per night. We wanted to stay in midtown within walking distance to everything.

Plenty of room for the 4 of us to sleep and move around and get ready to go out. The room was very clean, well decorated, and in overall very good shape. I did notice a couple of spots in the hall that had some worn wallpaper but everything was clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel is priceless in my opinion.

Almost each piece of cardio equipment has its own TV built into the machine (but they don't carry CNBC for the business gym- rat). No time limits are enforced on the cardio machines. There is also a very large weight room section and decent size changing room area. Most guests will be charged a separate fee for the gym beyond the rooom rate but it is worth it and the fee goes down per stay if you are a guest for more than a few days. You also are entitled to a piece of fruit after your work out. As for the rest of the hotel, the rooms are your basic Sheraton rooms. Most are small (like all NYC hotel rooms) but all have a decent desk to work at. The club level rooms are not that much different but the club lounge at this hotel is definitely above average for a Sheraton and has a really nice view. The hours at the lounge are good.

Also ended up payiing $30 ++ per night for a roll-away. Ends up this is a 4 star hotel on Tripadvisor (is that correct?) and for the price it was a terrible value. Especially compared to Boston or Washington D.C. 's where lower per night rates provide a HUGE step up in accomodations and experience and no one charges for roll-aways. Of course, this is the Big Apple, so lesson learned is to pay more to get more. Although we found the housekeeping staff to be friendly, the rooms are not clean. The carpet looks scary to walk on. The bathrooms were very small and there was rust visible in many locations. Public areas appear gritty (trash not picked up, room service trays fin hallways rom Friday night still not picked up by Saturday evening, carpets dirty). Check in was the most impersonal experience - virtually free of any interaction other than me having to follow up on a roll-away request I had noted on the on-line reservation form. No eye contact, no asking if I needed anything. Then, for check out , as is the case in many hotels, they slipped the bill under the door giving you the option of having an auto checkout - basically if it is okay, then you are good to go. The note that accompanied the draft bill was worded kind of funny - something that gave you the impression that they preferred for you not to have any interaction with the front desk, just leave. So for me it was like... okay .. .no room for redemption if a guest has a poor check in experience. It's too bad. The property needs a major renovation and perhaps is reflected in the front office team. I usually find Sheraton's to be friendly and clean, but this one needs some attention. Maybe we just caught the Front Desk on a bad day and/or the hotel is understaffed? Bottomline is we're planning on going to NY in September and needless to say, we will not give them another chance.

When I arrived by car, I stopped out front and they directed me to the garage (I did not have to pay them a tip to park it). The cost per day in the garage is $37 and there is no in and outs. We checked in at the kiosk and that worked great. we also handled our own bags which, again, saved us a tip. The room was decent sized for NY though it was not real clean. I visited with the desk and they gave us excellent advice on theater tickets. Also, when I needed a taxi, the people outside were excellent. All of that said, I thought I got a good price over the phone until my last morning when I got my bill. It was what I had agreed, but I found out others were paying a lot less than I was. In fact, the closest I heard of was $50 a night less. It would be a decent value at $250. But, not at close to $375.", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThis was the longest 3 nights of my life\u201d", "Author": "lovenewengland", "ReviewID": "UR5490088", "Content": "I was put in this hotel while in New York for work for 3 days.

The lobby of this hotel is a complete zoo, and don't expect to get to/from the lobby easily at any time of day or night because the elevators are slow, too few, and packed. It's a very very tourist-heavy hotel. My room was just plain hideous. The only decoration was a map of Queens on the wall. No joke. There were scuff marks all over the wall, stains and sticky things (like 40yr old dried gum) on the carpet, NO storage space to speak of. None. The television was on a folding table. The Bible had no drawer to live in because there are no drawers for your little things, so it was easily accessible next to the television. On the folding table. The room was freezing, but the air conditioner unit, which was ancient, would not turn off. So I asked maintenance to come and lower it, show me how to put on heat. Their solution? To turn it all off, so I have NO air circulation (windows don't open) and they left me 4 blankets. Um, it's June. I don't need all that, I just don't need frostbite. The stagnant air was SO bad, that on my third day, it had rained all night, there was so much moisture in the room, my clothes, everything was damp.

We did not expect the complimentary \"club lounge\" to be on a different floor than ours. However, it was no inconvenience to us. The hotel was VERY busy with several events going on. I did not realize the hotel had 50 floors, so the elevator was a little slow. Our room was clean on arrival and housekeeping was efficient in cleaning well. Our room must have been one of the complete rennovated ones, because it was nice and looked exactly like the photo online. My daughter and I had plenty of room with one king bed. No complaints. The bathroom was nice too. It sounds like some floors are cleaned and maintained better than others. Ours was great - floor 49. I would definintely stay there again!!! GREAT LOCATION!!!!

I would not have thought that a company like Starwood, could allow a hotel to operate in the condition that this one is in. The only way that I can describe the attitude of the management, housekeeping and engineering departments is \"complacency, and low regard for themselves and their guests.\" The Agent who checked us in was a delightful young lady. She was the highlight of our stay. As a Platinum SPG member, the hotel was kind enough to upgrade us to a suite. It was a bedroom with an adjoining door to a living area. Unless we have reached new levels of stupidity, we could not find a way to leave the doors between the two rooms open, so that we could enter and exit, without using the front doors. The bedroom was functional. Its state of repair was poor. Housekeeping was awful. The used condom floating around in the toilet bowl reminded me of the route that dead goldfish took as a kid. There were M & M's scattered on the floor, electric appliances unplugged (alarm clock and lamp), scotch tape still hanging on the walls from the \"Happy Birthday\" streamer that may have once hung on the walls, and more. The living area was also in poor repair and upkeep. It looks like the engineering department has put about ten layers of paint on the trim over the years, and in the course of doing so, had a hard time aiming at their target. The furniture was really tacky; my favorite was a blue velvet (where's Elvis?) couch. As was the case in the bedroom, M & M's were scattered on the floor, appliances (stereo) were unplugged, and the 1/2 filled bottle of mouthwash casused me to wonder if the previous user took a swig from the bottle. The common areas were equally disgusting. On our floor, the \"Exit\" sign was half-hanging from the wall. Walls and doors were in very poor repair. Speaking of doors, the sound heard from our neighbors were priceless, and alternated between excitement and pressure relief. The doors are paper thin. Access to the Club Lounge was a nice gesture, but on the early evening of our visit, there was little in terms of food to be had, and I guess I do not remember having to pay for soft drinks (two cokes, $7.50 plus tip). Not one staff member ever greeted us with as much as a hello, or good evening. Breakfast, on the other hand, included an excellent array of items, and we did not get hosed for juice or coffee, as we had anticipated. Again, not one hello or good morning from a staff member. Would we ever return to this hotel? absolutely not. It is an embaressment to Starwood. The \"consitency\" that we have come to expect of a major U.S. hotel brand is non-existent. My wife placed our clothes in a plastic garbage liner, and intends to boil them this evening; fearful that we may have picked up who know's what. If I were to bet, I would bet that this hotel is a \"profit machine\" for Starwood, and that it is dramatically undercapitalized. The complacency of the staff are tell-tale signs of poor management and oversight by Starwood. I suspect that this is a unionized hotel, and that organized labor is strangling poor management.

We did experience a similar problem as another reviewer had but we had a totally different outcome. Check in was quick and smooth (Starwood Preferred Guest line but the main check-in area wasn't crowded when we arrived in early evening). We did see long lines in the daytime so I'm sure it can be a problem. The bellman took us to our standard, no view room on the 27th floor only to find that it had not been completely cleaned. Bed was made but there was still trash on the desk area and the bathroom wasn't cleaned. At first the bellman asked if we wanted him to call the maid but then he thought better of it and asked us if we wanted a different room. We waited in the room with our luggage still on the trolley while he went back to the front desk. He came back shortly and told us he had us upgraded to one of the club floors (43rd) with a view of Times Square and entry into the Club Lounge (which included free breakfast and afternoon hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 oeuvres) during our stay. The room itself was exactly the same as our first room but the view was very nice and the perks in the club lounge were great. We saw a several other rooms of our business associates and they were all exactly the same, it seems only the view differs. We also spent some time in one of the suites which had the same exact bedroom as our room but opened onto a huge living room, dining room and wet bar area. We had no problems with the room or bathroom being clean. Our room looked newly renovated and everything was in good working condition. Although the room was small it was not cramped and had good closet and drawer space. A coffee pot with free coffee and tea was provided and replenished daily. There was a hair dryer, iron and ironing board and small safe. We didn't watch the TV but it seemed to have all the usual cable channels. There were two phones, one on the desk and one on the bedside table. Since my husband was working he thought the desk area was fine with easily accessible power outlets. The AC worked well and we liked the fact that the windows opened so we could get fresh air also. Of course it is in the middle of a big city so there is lots of traffic noise no matter what floor your room is on the sound carries. I think the Sheraton beds and bedding are probably the most comfortable of any of the hotel chains (we recently stayed at a Hyatt Resort and thought the Sheraton bed was better). Sheraton does not offer as nice bathroom amenities (soaps, shampoo, etc.) as some other resorts but ours were replenished daily. Only once did the maid come at a rather late time, around 5 p.m., to make up the room. She told my husband it had taken quite some time to clean a room that had been \"trashed\". We did notice when we were waiting on the 27th floor that there was at least one group of teenage kids staying there and they were quite noisy. We didn't have this problem on the 43rd floor so perhaps if you are visiting in the summer the upgrade to club level would be worth it. Only once did we briefly hear people talking loudly in the hall. The breakfast in the club lounge was great, bagels and all sorts of pastries, half a dozen cereals, hard boiled eggs, cheeses, yogurt, lots of fresh fruits and juices and a cappuccino machine. We only had time to stop in once in the early evening hours but there were a nice selection of cheeses, olives and other antipasti type appetizers. The bar is open in the evening but wine was expensive at $9 per glass. All the hotel employees we came in contact with were friendly and helpful. The concierge recommend a couple of good restaurants nearby. The hotel staff assisting with the convention were very helpful also. I'm not sure I would return to this hotel if I were going on a vacation since it is quite busy with convention groups and I usually prefer something more sedate for a personal trip.

I am extremely well travelled being a Travel Agent and have stayed in many hotels all over the world so I will try to give the positive and negatives on this hotel. First of all the main positive is the location. It is approximately 7 minutes walk from the middle of Times Square and so is really central and ideal if you like to be in the middle of everything. Initial impressions of the reception area were good as it is pretty impressive and when we checked in at approximately 2000 hrs there was no queue. We were given a room on the 20th floor and I had requested a high floor after reading various reports on Trip Adviser re this. Our room had 2 double beds which were extremely comfortable and the room was not big but this is something that you expect in New York but I would have to say the bathroom was extremely small and I got a shock when I saw it. The carpet in our room had a few marks on it but for our needs I felt it was adequate. I did go to reception to try and get a bigger room and I got to check another on the 30th floor but it was identical although they have a club lounge and must have bigger/better rooms which will carry a supplement. The corridors appeared to have been refurbished as the carpet seemed new but already there were scuff marks on paper which is a pity but people obviously bash cases against the walls etc. I found the reception staff pretty unhelpful apart from the gentleman who checked us in and other than that they werent at all helpful. The doormen particularly Ralph and Martin the Concierge were really helpful and friendly so its a pity the reception staff dont follow their colleagues example especially as they are the first point of contact. We did not eat in the hotel but there is a great Deli just over the road so I can't comment on the food. I would recommend the Sheraton & Towers if you want a good central location with clean rooms and a comfortable bed and if you are getting a fairly good rate but do not go expecting it to be amazing and you wont be disappointed. In my experience and I have been to New York a few times you do not get a lot for your money unlike Las Vegas for example where you tend to get a lot for your money but then again there are hotels with 5000 rooms there so there is a lot of competition and you get 5 star for 4 star prices there. I would not rule out a return visit to the Sheraton if I got a decent rate and I think that it's best selling point is its central location.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Sniper33", "ReviewID": "UR4322055", "Content": "I write a review for each hotel I stay in, not just when I have a bad experience -- so don't believe the over-the-top \"worst hotel ever\" reviews here.

We had 3 adults and a 12 year old. We had stayed at the Sheraton Manhattan on an earlier visit to NYC and found it to be satisfactory with above average staff.

Like everyone says the rooms are small but I have yet to find a spacious NYC hotel room. The bathroom was very small but big enough for what we needed it for. Both were clean. All I really want from a room is cleanliness. We were only in the room for about 8 hours and that was for sleeping. The best part of the hotel is the location. Close to everything in midtown! My husband and I walked 2 blocks to the David Letterman Show and my mom and daughter walked approx. 3 blocks to Radio City Music Hall. We also walked to Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and St. Patrick's. For downtown locations, we took the subway right outside the hotel on the corner. We waited for the prices to go down before booking our trip and that made the hotel worth the price. I don't know if my review would be as complimenting if I would have paid more than $199. But for the price it was well worth the location and the clean room. The hallways were a little scrungy and dark. This could be improved. The desk staff were not impolite but they weren't great either. We tried to check in early @ 12N but they said they didn't have any rooms but we could check our luggage free of charge. which was fine except I saw them passing out keys to others that checked-in before and after me. I guess my preferred status wasn't high enough to get a room at that point. So they said they would call when our room was available. We never received a call.

The old Americana is improving; this is a good tourist bet if you pay under $200. But it's still one notch above ordinary. I stayed one night during the transit strike, and was satisfied. Of course, it didn't hurt that I got a rate of $159 and earned triple points on my starwood preferred guest account. I booked at the last minute because I knew I wouldn't be able to get back into the city the next morning due to the transit strike. I don't know if this was due to the strike, but I had to make ressies online because no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get a hold of the hotel on the phone after 40 minutes of calling. The Sheraton New York (formerly the Loews Americana Hotel, a gleaming 1950s jewel) has always struck me as a tired, cliched relic of the 80s with no character and fake, tip-oriented service standards. The location, however, is perfect, on Seventh Avenue between 53rd and 52nd. You can walk to the MoMa, Central Park, Times Square, Fifth Avenue shopping, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Macy's, the Public Library, or practically any central Midtown tourist attraction. First of all, this is a tourist oriented hotel that caters to people who don't really know New York. As such, the first people you meet when you check in don't actually work for the hotel - they're an outside company that handles your luggage, takes your money and t h e n hands you off to the Sheraton Bell Staff, which I consider to be an inconvenience. A consequence of this is that they can't send your luggage up to your room without you in it - something I've routinely had done at numerous New York hotels, most recently the Westin Essex House. At check-in, expect to wait in line. I checked in at 7 pm, so my wait was less than 5 minutes. From what I've seen in the past at this hotel, check-in can take up to an hour at peak times. It's not that they're slow or understaffed, it's just that a lot of people check in and out at the same time. Again, tourists. My standard king room, 3403, was on the 24th floor and faced directly down 7th avenue toward Times Square. This is the view to request. If I were a couple rooms over, I would've been looking into an office building across 52nd street. The beds, which feel exactly like the 5-pillow down comforter-bespoke Westin heavenly bed, are great, possibly the saving grace of these rooms. The rest of the decor is relievingly simple and tasteful, with wooden blinds, a leather ergonomic chair and everything else done in black & chrome. There is no mini-bar, which was good considering my impulsiveness but I wonder how many tourists they could fleece if they provided this, uh, amenity. There's $15 high-speed internet access, both wireless and ethernet, but they had to send an engineer up to tinker with my nonfunctioning pay-per-view movies. Yes, bathrooms are your basic 5'x7'6\" hotel small, but mine was very clean. The moral of the story is the better the bargain, the more you'll warm up to the Sheraton New York. If by some terrible act of fate you find yourself paying more than $200 per night, run the other way to a different hotel like the Doubletree Guest Suites (same class, more space in the epicenter of Times Square), the Omni Berkshire Place (trying to be 4 star around the corner from Fifth Ave), or even the Waldorf-Astoria, possibly the best tourist pick in the Big Apple.

However... and I think this was really the only bad thing about the room... the temperature control on the airconditioning/heater didn't work. In terms of location the hotel is a block west of broadway and very near to Times Square, Central Park, Shopping on 5th Ave, the Theatre District and Rockefeller Center. There is a subway station right around the corner (literally!) from the front door of the hotel as well as one on the corner of 51st and Broadway. These two stops will get you just about anywhere you need to go. For those of you who might be concerned about taking the subway, keep in mind a few pointers... Not all the subway stations are handicap or small child friendly...be prepared to climb a LOT of stairs.

I could have checked in at an automatic terminal with my credit card but decided to do it with reception so that I could request a renovated room as so many here have suggested. The receptionist was a little cold, but polite and upon my enquiery, confirmed that the room we had been allocated was indeed a renovated room. The room was located on the 18th floor. The corridor outside looked very new and was decorated in Dark blue - very nice. The room wasn't a bad size and was clean and looked fairly newly decorated. I can't say I had any complaints at all about the room and we were very pleased one day to come back and find all our toiltries in the bathroom had been arranged on a towel next too the sink by the cleaner for us. The only slight problem we had was with a blocked toilet, but a quick call down to the Promise Help desk and they said they would send someone straight up as we were just going out for dinner. Sure enough, when we got back it was unblocked and we had an answerphone message waiting to confirm that everything was ok and asking we call back if we had any more problems, a nice touch. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the hotel. No troubles with the Paper thin walls that others have mentioned.

We had booked a club room with the buy 4 nights get 2 free offer and thus paid only $186 per night (not including taxes and add fees) for 6 nights. Our room was ready when we arrived at 10:30 despite their 3:00 check in time, Yay. It was on the 50th floor and had free access to both the gym (Lower Level) and the Club Lounge (44th). We groaned when we noticed that it was right by the elevators, but throughout our stay we never heard a peep from anywhere :) The club lounge offered breakfast from 6:30-11:00 and orderves from 5-8pm and there was a computer with internet access in the lounge as well as free bottles of water. Our room was fantastick! We had a lovely king sized sweet sleeper bed, made for heavenly sleeps :) There was a desk in the room that ran the span of the room with a really comfy desk chair too. From our window we could see times square, and there are thick wooden slat blinds on the windows and once you figure out how to operate them they are great! (and do keep out the light if you close them tight). Also in the room - tv, 2 telephones, a programmable code safe in the closet - you program it yourself, a nice comfy robe and lots of closet space, also internet access (add. charge). The bathroom was small but nice. It had a clean tub with shower head (heavenly rainfall) and a nice grip on the floor of the tub. All the usual trinkets, shampoo, cond, sewing kit, mouthwash, hand cream and such were provided. I think the sink counter was marble, very nice and it had chrome accents, as well as a very feminine friendly magnifying mirror. The elevators in the hotel were so fast, it is nearly impossible to imagine how fast you are moving. There are two sets of elevators 1 set going to floors 1-24, and the other set going to 24-50. Check in and check out were easy enough, we got a late c/o for 2 pm no charge. And we paid after that $3.00 per bag to store them till we left. We tried out the room service, and though it is obviously expensive they pull out all the stops. They have gratuity incl in the bill, and they will collect your table when you are finished (check picture). The gym is great, life fitness machines and comp towels. It is free to club floor members but $10 a day i think for other guests - both have to sign in upon each visit. Area: Carnegie Deli is right across the street about 1 block north, and times square is south about 5 blocks. The theater district is about 7-10 blocks south in the times square area. And the best restaurant to eat at - Virgil's BBQ check it out it is on W 44th street between 6th ave and broadway. Also check out my pictures that I added for this hotel.

I stayed on a \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" floor, but the rooms were tiny, with multiple stains on the carpets, dirty and torn wallpaper in the bathroom, hairs in the sink and toilet (?) left by a previous guest, an air conditioner that rattled like the dickens and didn't even work sufficiently. No matter, since I had to open the windows to get a gross sickly-sweet perfumey stench out the room. You know, the kind of smell you might expect at a Motel 6, not a Sheraton. Clearly, this place is well-overdue for a renovation. When I complained about the air conditioner (necessary since it was about 85 and humid), I was moved to a different room (note - I first called downstairs to inquire about switching rooms and was put on hold with the front desk inexplicably for 15 minutes, at which point I just walked down there to find the front desk staff doing nothing). I was switched to another room - supposedly the best one available - which was just a different room on the same floor. It had the same dirt and the same problems as the prior room except that the AC didn't rattle (it still didn't work very well). Since it was past midnight at this point, I decided to just stay in the room, but sleeping was another issue. The insulation is TERRIBLE; kind of like what you might find at a one-star motel. You can hear everything in the hallway and adjoining rooms, like guests slamming their doors and talking, watching TV, etc. Basically, the three nights I stayed at this place, I didn't get to sleep much due to the door-slamming every 5-10 minutes or so until well past 2am. I had early meetings every morning, and not being able to sleep on a business trip is the worst. It seemed like the other guests on my floor were either large familes, loud teenagers, or drunk twenty-somethings, and none of these people apparently need to sleep. Oh, and I was a little annoyed to discover that, in addition to the $329 room charge, it was also $10 per visit to use the fitness center, and $3 per bag to store your luggage in the luggage room. So it was another $6 to basically hold my bag for two hours (I had to check out at noon but had an early evening flight). Bottom line, I wouldn't ever stay here again or recommend that anyone else stay here, especially if you're a business traveler. If you need to stay in this area, there are much better alternatives like the Marriott Marquis (larger and more upgraded rooms, cleaner, QUIETER, no charge for the gym or luggage storage, etc.).

We identified ourselves to him. He got on a cell phone and called someone Else and said \"They are here\". He then escorted us outside, where a long black limo pulled up to the curb. Another Man got out wearing the exact same outfit as the first, but he was twice that man's size! He looked like a brick wall wearing a mafia outfit. He opened the doors to the limo, and as we were getting in he said \"How ya doin', I am Mario, your Driver\" and closed the door. DH then turned to me and said \"I don't want to wear cement overshoes!\". Now the fun started, here we are in the back of a long limo, and our driver was driving like he was in the game \"Crazy Taxi\"!! We were going like 80 miles per hour, weaving in and out of traffic, barely missing other vehicles by millimeters!!

Our room had all the amenities we needed, internet access, a coffee maker (stocked with both regular and decaf, sugars and creamers), a room safe, blow dryer, Iron and ironing board, and the most Incredible king size bed! That was the most comfortable bed ever! We then hit the town with a vengeance! We did some amazing things..My Husband took a picture of me with a mounted Policeman and his horse!, we walked down to the SoHo District and took in a comedy show at Ha! (I have never laughed so much in my life!!), went to Greenwich village to a restaurant, then wandered back to the hotel as by this time it was around 2 am! We got up at 6 am to go downtown to the New York Library (I wanted Pictures of the stone Lions), went 2 more blocks to Grand central Station (Beautiful place...and HUGE!!!!) got on the subway (very clean, and very friendly!) and rode the subway to wall street, were we took pictures of where George Washington took his oath of office, pictures of Wall Street. and found an Art Gallery of \"The 70's\", we wondered through the art gallery for over an hour looking at pictures of Blondie, Rod Stewart, John Lennon, Any Warhol, lots of statues, and a movie about New York, before and after 911 (I was bawling by the end of it). Then went a few more blocks to Bowling Green, where we saw (and took pictures) of the eternal flame and tribute to 911. bought tickets for the ferry to the Statue of Liberty (and was searched, x-rayed, belts and shoes removed etc by the New York SWAT team.) Finally we boarded the ferry to Liberty Island, where I got some amazing Pictures of the great lady herself! Then the ferry to Ellis Island, went through the Ellis Island Museum, and back on the ferry to mainland. We then walked a few more blocks to ground Zero, where I cried again, and got some more great pictures! We then wandered around The Century 21 store where we found deals like $600 Prada bags marked down to $20 (The real deal too!) We figured out why NY'ers are wonderfully dressed and thin...you can find designer clothing for a lot less than food in NY!!!! Restaurants are EXPENSIVE!! We then wandered around and found a few really cool parks, and Art pieces (like the miniature of the city where my Husband posed as King Kong on the Mini Empire State building..LOL) We then went back down in the subway, watched some break dancers, caught the subway to the Empire State building, (It was light when we entered, and full dark when we got through more searches, lines and the ride up!) We then got back on the subway, went back uptown, to a pizza joint and back to the Hotel, on the way we saw a film truck drive by us, filming an ambulance and fire truck whizzing by!!

As a \"platinum\" starwood guest I was \"upgraded\" to a \"corner\" room on the 47th floor and was told this was a \"larger\" room. The room was tiny compared to the corner rooms at the Marriott Marquis. I'd hate to see what the \"normal\" sized rooms are like. Since my family was with me, we got a room with two double beds. The room was so small, two people could not walk in front of the beds at the same time. If the closet door was open you could not get into the bathroom, which was tiny as well. The air conditioning in the room did not work well despite having maintenance \"fix\" it three times during our stay. They finally said \"that's as good as it gets\". NYC was hot ('90 degrees), humid, and rainy all that week. Being from Houston, I know how a good air conditioner should work and this one didn't come close. The first two days, we were told they were completely \"sold out of two bed rooms\" and could not move us to another room, later they offered us a room on the 7th floor - which we declined since it was a smoking room and the noise from the streets at that level. The room is supposedly designed to make business travelers comfortable, but this room only had one phone, no outlets on the desk to plug in your PC, Cell recharger, etc. you had to climb under the desk and unplug the desk lamp to be able to plug anything else into one outlet. The shades in the room would not close properly, so every morning you were awakened by the sun streaming on your face. The walls are extremely thin, so you could clearly hear every word in the room next to us, not to mention the slaming of every door down the halls all hours of the day or night. The halls were dark, narrow and dingy. They reminded me of a dungeon. We had \"lounge\" access on the 44th floor, and that too was a big disappointment. It was crowded every morning no matter what time you went there with a bunch of kids - apparently there was some dance competition being help at the hotel. Being used to the lounge at the Marriott where soft drinks are complementary, my daughter asked for a coke to drink one day and we were shocked to learn that it was $3.75 for a four ounce drink in a glass that was mostly ice.

I don't know if these folks were allowed to 'upgrade' to get the floor's amenities without actually staying on the club floor or what, but the normally quiet club room was more of a teen-time party than a happy hour. If the hotel is going to allow anyone with an extra $40 to upgrade for the 'free eats' then management needs to be more on the ball in keeping suffiecient staff to keep the club room stocked and cleaned up. It was obvious they were understaffed, so many dirty tables, etc. The floor was full of ground in crackers, the hot foods for happy hour disappeared in a twinkle.

I took pictures of the hotel and will post them if they turn out. My friends and I came from different parts of the US to stay in New York City for the Daytime Emmy Awards. We heard around that the stars would be having a dinner at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers before heading to the Radio City Music Hall for the awards and that some of the stars were also staying there that night. So we booked for this past Friday night. We arrived too early for check-in so we hung out at our friend's room who had arrived the night before until it was time to check-in. The hotel itself is very nice with a huge lobby. We arrived at the reservation desk and were told at first that the room had been already charged for the night before we even got there. We thought it strange since we gave no such authorization to put anything through. We only gave them a credit card number to hold the room for us. We paid for the room in full with money right then as we had originally intended, but then they charged us a holding fee of fifty dollars that they would refund tommorrow morning when we checked out along with any other refunds, since they weren't suddenly sure if they had put the room through on the charge card already.*shakes head* Anyways, we had put our luggage in our friend's room, which was very small, earlier and we went to get it. As with lots of hotels elevators were a problem that day. It was very busy and yes we did wait, but no more than ten minutes at most and we were packed in like sardines like elevators at many hotels. Also like most hotels seemingly in the area there are different elevators that go to different floors. There were elevators that go to floors 1-20 and others that went to floors 20 and above. Our friend's stayed in room 1444 of course on the fourteenth floor. We were staying in room 4036 on of course the 40th floor. We picked up our luggage and of course had to go back down to the first floor because the elevators on the fourteenth floor will not go up as far as we needed to go. Then from the first floor we had to get an elevator that went up to floor 20 and above. We got to our room and, of course as we now expected it to be, the room was very small and the bathroom matched. Our friend had a king sized bed room while we had double bed room. I was very happy to see that the coffee maker and condiments weren't stashed in the bathroom like in some hotels and the beds were really comfortable. Yes the room had a bench and wooden blinds that for us worked to keep the sun out for the most part in the morning. Unfortunately we did not know and could not get the windows open or figure out the heat/AC device cause it was humid in that room. The view from our window wasn't fantastic. It was also very dark like the bulbs were a lower wattage so we couldn't really see as well. We made the best of it. We crawled and walked sideways around what little space we had and there was the plus of finding we had extra blankets. The bathroom for me had only three really good features that stood out for me besides the negative about it being so small. The water pressure was excellent, the lighting in there was really nice and bright, and that it had an extra facial mirror sitting on the counter that you don't get in other hotels. We eventually went back into the hotel lobby to check out and maybe get some pics of the actors and actresses. Security was tight. I think they were just frustrated and I can't say I blame them cause they are just trying to do their jobs, but more than once they sat there and basically ordered us out of the hotel. The hotel we had a room at. Because there were hoards of us fans suddenly wanting pics and to say hi to these celebs and crowds do amazing things to frustrate security. Many people wondered at the crowds and kept asking what we were waiting for. Lol! Anyways, after we came back to the hotel from the Emmys at Radio City Music Hall we were looking to get drinks so we went to I guess the Hudson or whatever bar that is at the Sheraton and they told us they had already done last call so we made inquires. The lounge bar also in the hotel said that they were closing up, but were really nice enough to serve us all, there was like seven of us, all one round of drinks before shutting down. The next day we found out that the credit card wasn't charged and they refunded the fifty dollars that was promised. The hotel location is great, close to many sights, and the beds in the room very comfy. I just don't think the room for the size it is is worth the full price you laid out for it. We stayed at the Mariott Marquis the next night and the rooms were much nicer for about the same price. I also heard from our friends from room 1444 that they had stayed at the Sheraton Manhattan that was right across the street before and that the rooms there were much bigger than the one they had at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers. The fact was that the celebs we wanted to see were going to be at this hotel. That was really the deciding factor for me to stay there not the great price or room. The hotel in itself is alright so my advice to anyone looking into staying at this hotel is to shop for discounts or something else so that your stay would be more worth your money.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location but would choose a cheaper hotel next time\u201d", "Author": "daenis30", "ReviewID": "UR3456692", "Content": "Stayed at the Sheraton for five nights.

For all the people who moaned about the rooms, thats fair enough, but spending 5 days in New York, we didn't really stay much at the hotel. Too busy shopping and siteseeing! I would recommend you request a higher room as it would be noisy being on a lower level with all the traffic. Great views from the top. When enquiring initially about booking a room direct, we were told that to get a higher room you had to pay more. However, when we got there, we were put at the top when asked. So beware! not always the case! The concierge were helpful on both occasions when we asked for something. We didn't have alot to do with the staff as we were never in the hotel really, just to sleep.

The walls are PAPER THIN. We heard each and every word from the guests next door to us (both sides) and they even woke us up a couple mornings talking. We stay in hotels at least 6 nights a month, so we are used to traveling and noise. But, there needs to be some major sound proofing done in this hotel. If you are a HEAVY sleeper, you should be o.k. Now, on to the positives. The location of this hotel is excellent. We walked every where. It is very close to Central Park and Times Square. We walked to both several times. We also walked over to see The Plaza Hotel (the one from the Home Alone Lost in New York movie, as well as countless other movies). We even walked to the Empire State building one night, but that is a LONG walk, that I wouldn't recommend. We took the subway back. There is a subway stop very close to the hotel. Don't take the stop at the Port Authority. There is one closer and much easier of a walk, especially if you are hauling luggage with you! We took the \"yellow\" subway stops to the hotel. This includes the R line and the N line and a few others. We were also very impressed with security at this hotel. We (as well as many others in the hotel) were disturbed by guests (children) running up and down the halls at 1:30 a.m. When we called the front desk, we were told that many other people on various floors of the hotel were calling about this same group of children. They were unsupervised and just running wild. But, the lady who answered the phone said, \"Now that we know what floor they are on, we will send someone right up.\" The security guard was there in less than 30 seconds, no joke, I don't know how he made it that fast. But, that was the last we heard of the running, yelling kids. Thanks security folks! Now, a description of the room. It is very important that you ask for a RENNOVATED room. We did ahead of time and were given one at check-in (though they can't guarantee them in advance, they will give you one if they have them), a King sized, non-smoking room. We were originally going to stay at the Marriott Marquis, which we have stayed at before, but didn't because they didn't have any non-smoking rooms available. The rennovated room was nice. I liked the bathroom decor which was shades of blue and had a neat, silver and marble sink unit. The toiletries were nice, Pantene hair products and Vaseline Intensive Care lotion. There is no pool in this hotel, but you are free to use the pool at the Sheraton Manhattan across the street. We are glad we chose this hotel though, as it has much better tripadvisor reviews than its sister property. One other minor issue I had is that they have blinds, but no curtains, so the light comes into your room very early in the morning. We were on the 32nd floor and had a bit of a view of the street towards the Times Square area, which was nice. For the price, I would recommend this hotel over others. We did like the room in the Marriott Marquis better--it just looked newer, but apparently the elevator situation has gotten out of hand there. Speaking of elevators, the ones at the Sheraton were super fast and we never had to wait for one. They were so fast that your ears popped when you went up to our floor! We did see lots of school groups staying here, to see Broadway shows and to perform at various events--a lot of the groups milling about the lobby were dressed in costumes, etc. The location is everything and it would make a nice base for exploring NYC. One last thing, 2 luggage valets (the stands you put your suitcase on) were a very nice touch.

We returned in the late afternoon and quickly checked-in and went to our room on the 30th floor. It was newly (but darkly) decorated, and clean throughout. The room was very small - we had to walk sideways between the beds and the walls. I'd read alot about the beds, but we found them small (double) and not amazingly soft like I'd read. They weren't anything special like I'd expected. The room was also warm and stuffy. There was a blower fan that we had turned up high, but it just didn't move the air enough. We ended up cracking the window open and that was a big improvement. The location of the hotel is great for first time visitors. Now that I know the streets and area better, I'd probably stay somewhere less expensive. The staff was all very nice and efficient, and the room was clean and quiet. On the day we left, after we checked out the charge to check suitcases was $3.00 per bag - a bit high in my opinion after all we'd spent to stay there.

I should start off by saying that I am very particular when it comes to hotels. I only stayed at the Sheraton because my brother had booked a room there. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve visited Manhattan several times, but this hotel is in the best location I have ever seen. The hotel is near to everything, including the subway, diners, a pharmacy, Broadway and Times Square. Fifth Avenue and central park are just a stroll away. The photographs on the Internet do not adequately portray the size of this hotel. The building is very large, and has a huge, bright and well-decorated lobby. I found the staff at the front desk to be very polite and helpful. The man who checked me in was very courteous, and chatted and answered my queries without the impatience that is so common in New York hotels. He gave me a refurbished room without my having to ask. Many of the reviews here mention the club level floors, so I enquired about this and was told that the rooms are exactly the same as the other refurbished ones, except that they have gym privileges and light food provided in the club room in the morning and evening. I decided to stick with my standard room. The elevators are super-fast and you rarely have to wait too long to board. My room was on the 34th floor. The room was clean and spacious, for New York, and had the wooden blinds and benches that you can see on the website. From my window I had a great view of Broadway and Times Square. I have to say that the modern business-like style of decoration in the room does not appeal to me. I prefer my hotels to look homely. I often felt like I was in an office! There were a number of lamps and wall lights in the room, but the use of energy-saving light bulbs gave that uncomfortable white glow to the place. My bathroom was fairly large, for New York, and was brightly lit. It had a small bath and shower. The hotel room also had a safe, which was easy to operate, and, for you Brits, a decent coffee percolator, with reasonably good coffee supplied. (Making your own hot drinks in your room: You are a tacky bunch!) The Sheraton beds really are as great as people have been saying here. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really soft! The only real problem I had was that you can hear everything that is going on in the rooms next to you. I could hear a high-spirited argument in Spanish on my first night, but I was exhausted from the flight from Dublin and slept anyway. Next day I went to the restaurant in the lobby for breakfast. 20 bucks gets you a buffet where you can eat everything and anything. (Hot and cold.) This allows you to stock up on energy that will keep you going well into the day. The service is great and the money is well spent. Overall, this is a good mid-range hotel. Rooms are fairly spacious, with office-like decoration, fixtures and fittings. The staff, facilities and service are excellent. The location is second to none.

Well, let me tell you, my three days at this hotel were among the best I have ever experienced and I have stayed at some of the top hotels in Manhattan. We arrived at the hotel on Sunday around 11am. The lobby was packed afterall it was checkout time. The wait to check in was only about 5 minutes despite the crowds. I asked if it would be possible to get an upgrade to the Club level as mentioned in other reviews. I was willing to pay for this upgrade, but to my surprise, the woman just gave me the upgrade to the 48th floor at no charge. Of course, that meant I couldn't check in until 4pm but it was worth the wait. The room was beautiful and the bed was the best I have ever slept upon. There were guests on both sides of me, but I never heard any noise - not even running water. Yes there was street noise, but that is a part of New York - if you want quiet go to the country. There was a big desk and HBO and 5 pillows - I could have just stayed in the room and been happy. A great perk of the Club floor is the 5 - 7pm appetizers. Very good and could easily been a whole dinner. Breakfast was also included and the service was friendly - thank you Mohammed. Very good , fresh bread and raspberries.

I've paid less for a room in NYC and I've paid more, but what you get for your money at this Sheraton compares extremely unfavorably with any other hotel I have ever stayed in. It's not because the hotel is busy and noisy -- although it's both of these -- one must expect this when staying in a large NYC hotel, but is solely the result of a poorly trained, extremely rude staff, who don't have the first clue about how to provide satisfactory customer service. First of all, when I called ahead of time to confirm my reservation (it wasn't showing up on SPG) and asked to be transferred to the front desk, I was transferred to a recording system, and then put on hold until the computer hung up on me. This happened three times. I hope some of you can understand the frustration of this, and the ominous feeling this would give a guest about their prospective stay. So I called back and asked to speak with an on-duty manager. They connected me to a woman named Andrea Williams. I explained my frustration at being hung up on three times, and that I just wanted to confirm my reservation. She simply confirmed my reservation and asked if there were anything else she could do for me. I said an apology would be great and some indication that she might look into whatever the problem was with the phone system would be appropriate. She very disingenuously said she would and hung up on me. No apology. Just rudeness. This is not an appropriate response for anyone in a customer service position. So I called Gary Sims, the hotel manager, and left him a voicemail letting him know about my experience and how it left me very unexcited about my coming stay. Of course, he never bothered to respond. Upon checking in, I found the hotel extremely noisy and busy, but as I said this is to be expected. There was a long line at the understaffed reception desk, but I was happy that my Starwood Gold Status saved me from that debacle. The room was small, but adequate. I noted that the room was quite warm, and immediately set the thermostat to its coldest position and put the fan on high. I then went down to meet friends for dinner. When I returned I had been out of the room for several hours, and it was still too warm for me to sleep comfortably. I like to sleep in a cooler than average room. Temps should be below 70 degrees, or I really have a hard time sleeping. This is why hotel a/c and heat units have thermostats...or so I thought. It was now about midnight, so I called down to the front desk. Again it was inadequately staffed and there was no one to answer guests questions...I waited on hold for nearly 15 minutes before getting to talk to someone. They said they'd send up someone from engineering. I waited....no one showed up. I tried to call the front desk again, but again too long a wait. It was now 12:30am and I just decided it would be better to visit the front desk personally. After waiting -- even more disgruntled guests were there now, and only two receptionists were present at this huge hotel -- I asked if I could change rooms to a cooler room, they said they would send someone up, I said that I'd already waited for someone to come up. They said they get him there quicker. Finally an engineer showed and -- of course -- told me there was nothing he could do. Oy! Back down to the front desk I went. After waiting another twenty minutes out came Mr. Long -- a manager -- to take care of me...Yeah! He came up to my room and announced that the temperature was fine! Hallelujah, I'd been up and complaining for absolutely no reason. All I needed was Mr. Long to tell me that my discomfort was all in my head. I explained it was not a comfortable temperature for me. He suggested I sleep on top of their \"heavenly bed\" blanket. \"After all,\" he explained, \"it's a heavy blanket.\" (I wouldn't allow this man to run a Nathans Hotdog stand in New Jersey, nevermind a hotel in NYC!) Absolutely, outrageously rude and incompetent. Where does Sheraton train its employees? Attica? I told Mr. Long that since they were unable to deliver an adequate room, I simply wanted to check out immediately so that I could check into the W Hotel nearby -- at an additional profit for his parent company Starwood by the way. He refused and let me know that I would be charged for that evenings accomodations no matter what. After a long argument he finally agreed to do me the \"FAVOR\" of not \"PENALIZING\" me if I chose to check out the following day. INCREDIBLE! I checked into the W New York the next day. And although the initial room they put me in was also too warm, you'll never guess what they said... They said, \"we are so sorry Mr. Carp, please let us find you a more comfortable room.\" Which they promptly did...and I lived happily ever...well for the next two days. Point is, it takes so little to make a dissapointed guest into a satisfied guest. We can all understand when there are issues with equiptment or other things outside of the personal control of hotel employees. What is absolutelty unacceptable is a staff that cannot simply understand that all a guest needs is a sincere apology and a genuine effort to correct that which has gone wrong. Stores like Nordstroms, and many other companies have recognized the value of such a philosophy, and train their employees accordingly. In it's New York Hotel and Towers I urge Sheraton to start from scratch, as it will never serve its customers adequately until the replace all of its managers. Do yourself a favor and stay at any other hotel in Manhattan. My mother liked the Marriot in Times Square very much, and I've had excellent stays at the W New York, the W Tuscany, Swishotel's The Drake, and The Paramount.

But the furniture was nice and new. The only complaints was the A/C was not working very good, the room did get a bit hot. The internet was outragously priced, like $14 for all day high speed. Their is a lot of noise from the streets. I would not recommend staying below the 16th floor, if you do, try and complain to get higher. The hotel is VERY busy but like I said, the staff is pleasant. The hotel is in a GREAT location! It is only 10 or so blocks from times square which is a short walk! You are far away enough from all the noise and craziness of times square.

Checked in late in the evening, and was welcomed by a terrific front desk receptionist. She was extremely friendly, and accommodating. We had a package deal with Expedia, but were paying separately for a different room since we were checking in a day earlier. She made sure we did not have to move rooms which was of great convenience to us. The rooms are so small (very characteristic of NYC). Two people will be slightly comfortable, but a third person joined us later and it was incredibly close quarters. We asked for a roll-a-way bed and it was completely pointless, and really funny! The other reviews that downgrade the cleanliness of the rooms are true. Our room was very dusty. There are wood blinds that need to be polished frequently and they are not. The dust was at least half an inch thick. There was all kinds of paper, wrappers, candies, and 'batteries' under both of the queen size beds. I reported this to the front desk on the club floor. He said he would report it to housekeeping. It was still there when we checked out the next week, probably still there today. They have this service guarantee, and the front desk said he would compensate me, he never did. The beds are very very very very comfortable. Pillowly, with just the right amount of softness and firmness. I'm thinking about buying one since they have them for sell on their website. One of the best parts of this hotel is the club floors. If you stay on a club floor, you recieve daily complimentary breakfast and hor'douevers in the evening. It was nice to save money on room service and to mingle with the other guests. The service in the lounge was great as well. Room service was expensive, but not surprising. They are very quick and believe in getting it right. My order was wrong the first time, and they sent up another one immediately and apologized for the mix up. The pool and fitness center are nice. The sauna is great and the shower facilities are impeccable. The location was great. Only a few blocks to walk to Times Square and bus service is across the street. Subways just a few blocks away. The Marriott is my first choice, the 2nd would be the Milennium Hilton, and the Sheraton would be 3rd. We're taking another trip next year.

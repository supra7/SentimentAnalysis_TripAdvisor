The check-in staff was courteous, professional, and fast. Once in my room, I quickly placed a room-service order with the on-site TGIFriday's. The room was very nice-spacious with pretty decor. The TV was modern and placed perfectly for lying in bed and viewing. Soon, I was sipping wine and munching on pasta after a long day of traveling. The bed was especially comfortable, and I loved the thick and cozy duvet cover. The next morning, I used the exercise center. There were nice treadmills and ellipticals, each with their own attached TV screen. I didn't have earphones, however, so I had to read the close captioning! The room's bathroom was very nice and the included toiletries were very good with a lovely scent. Checkout the next morning was easy and efficient.

Honestly, I probably would have been better staying at Red Roof Inn. The rooms are mediocre. The front desk service is sub-par. The fact that they charge you $13.00 a day to park in a nearly empty parking lot is highway robbery. Just what they charge 120.00 a night for, I haven't figured out yet. Then, on top of that, they continue placing holds on my card everyday for \"incidentals\" even though I haven't charged a thing to my room. What is that about? I understand keeping a card on file, but continuously placing holds on my account for nothing being charged is ridiculous.

I've stayed at 2 of the other hotels in the complex before probably booked with Priceline as I did this one. I tried to book even further south through priceline without any luck. I got a decent, not great, price as many of the hotels were booked this October weekend for the Chicago Marathon. I found the hotel clean, quiet and frankly fine, nothing special. Parking is an additional $13 which stinks since I still had trouble finding a close spot. Ate at Fridays which was fine except they added the gratuity after 10:00. As a former waitress, I would have tipped more but was annoyed at this. Worked out in the fitness center which was 2 treaadmills, an elliptical and some free weights. Tiny, but suited me. No free breakfast but there was a bar in the lobby available.

The hotel is located in a complex of hotels, all about one half mile from Midway Airport. From the hotel room window, I could see three other hotels. Within the complex, there are multiple dining options, and attached to the Courtyard is TGI Fridays, which was very good. The rooms, like the rest of the hotel, were acceptable but out of date. The beds stood out as being very comfortable, but there was no flat screen TV, and the shower was especially hard to operate. Temperature control was okay. The service did stand out. All of the receptionists and other staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet is well worth the $10 per person. Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate is available in the lobby. I got this hotel through Hotwire for $67 a night, while some guests payed $42 a night on Priceline. The hotel was charging $139 walk up, per night. For $67, it was a decent value, but for $139, it would make more sense to use another hotel in the complex, maybe the Holiday Inn. Sleep quality, despite the nice beds, was just average. In this hotel's 11 year existence, the concept of sound proofing has not been learned. The noise from the airport was not the problem. The problem was the constant and loud hallway noise, and noise from adjacent rooms, that continued almost 24 hours a day. Late arriving guests, even those not being loud, could easily be heard at 12 AM walking to their rooms and opening and shutting doors. Guests catching early flights could be heard as early as 4 AM.

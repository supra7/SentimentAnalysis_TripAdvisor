They do accept pets-which is rare for an Los Angeles hotel- but the fee is $50.00- a bit costly for the average pet fees we have seen in the mid-priced hotel range. The pool was cold, and is on the shady side of the hotel, it also seemed to have a lot of leaves etc in it, though there are a lot of trees and plants around it. The water was clear though, so it is cared for. The room we had, had the two queen beds and a rollaway. It was clean, and modern a great space for a family with several kids. The location was great, a decent neighborhood for Los angeles, and right on the edge of the city. We could see the white Hollywood sign on the hill from the parking area. It is a short drive to the Hollywood walk of fame etc. There is a lot of dining all around the hotel, chain and local restaurants. The hotel features a simple but nice breakfast in the morning. Hardboiled eggs, yogurts, fruits, a variety of rolls and toast, coffee, tea, juices, also my kids favorite- the make your own waffle bar. The hotel features a good sized eating area, but like most hotels, do not wait until a half hour before the breakfast closes to eat- it gets very busy and crowded then. The staff here are very friendly. The hotel does have an odd elevator system, it is in the lobby, and comes up through one side of the hotel. If your room is on the other side of the hotel you may have a small walk to your room-bring wheeled luggage. They do have a stairway on this side of the hotel, but once you go out the door it locks behind you and you cannot get in even with your room key-security?. So you must walk to the other side of the hotel and re-enter through the lobby to ride the elevator or walk the stairway there. This can be difficult if you are parked at the far end of the parking area. They do have a lot of handicapped parking zones near the lobby for people with difficulty walking so much. I noticed someone mentioned this hotel to be a find in Los Angeles, I would agree! The rooms we have had prior to this are small and costly, and all seem to have parking issues etc- Nice place-thank you!", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worthington, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a find in L.A.!\u201d", "Author": "Carolyn679", "ReviewID": "UR115388763", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here for three nights during our visit to L.A.

We had 5 people staying in a 2 bedroom, and the hotel provided a roll away bed. The room was HUGE - much bigger than your average 2 bedroom middle of the road hotel room.

We never had a problem with noise, and the beds were comfy making for a good sleep. The pool is small, but its nice to just sit out by and take a load off. The location is in OK depending on where you want to go - close to silverlake, fairly close to downtown, and conveniently located off the freeway. Not that much nearby but there is definitely a bar or two within walking distance. We had no problems with the front desk or staff, they seemed very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was decent, they had fruit, waffles, some kind gross eggs and bacon, yogurt, hard boiled eggs - and coffee, tea, and juice of course! FREE PARKING (very important in LA). Its located up on its own little hill away from the street so we felt very safe. There was an elevator to our floor (I saw another review that said there wasn't). I'm not going to lie, it does look a little run down from the outside, but the rooms/lobby are much nicer once you are inside. I'd say the room and service is what you would expect for the rate.

Our room was big and very, very clean. I am a super freak about dirt and germs, but I was very pleased and comfortable there. The bedding was crisp white, which meant that I knew it had to be clean or I would have noticed stains/ dirt. It was very quiet and free parking was great. The breakfast was the best of any of the 5 hotels that we stayed at in the similar price range. I felt very relaxed here, and we didn't have any stress or problems. Everything was as I hoped and expected or better. FYI There is a laundry mat just half a block north of the hotel. The subway is about three/four blocks away. We didn't find too many places to eat within walking distance, but when driving, we weren't far from restaurants. We bought snacks to eat in our room in the evening.

The hotel has cleaning staff who always seem very busy, and the front desk staff are friendly and helpful. They even suggest the things that wouldn't occur to us to ask about. As for the location, LA is a very big city, but I was pleased and surprised to discover I could get to almost anywhere with very little trouble because of its nearness to major highways.

Yesterday night after confirm at the front desk that \"there is always some one in charge for attend any customer 24/7\" my nightmare begins. After a very short night I went at the front desk around 4am for my check out process and for a taxi, And what I found was a message that says\"One moment please, I will return in a few minutes...\" and at the end \"Smile you are in Camera\" I was waiting for around 1 hour with no signal of any person, until that I understand that nobody was going to help me so I start to search for taxi options via Internet and making several international calls trying to find a ride to the airport. When I was able to arrive to the Airport, the Airline told me that I lost my flight and because of this my connection, so that means that I will not arrive home the day I planned and all my next day meetings must be canceled. As a result the next available flight was 12 hours later with 3 scales and several hours between flights, meaning that my next night will be at another airport, I will arrive with 20 hours delay. With this experience the impact was more than just a lost flight, and because of that I will proceed to send an Letter to RRHH explaining this situation and why this hotel can not be an option when we need to be in a business travel.

When I pulled into the parking lot the check in location was not early to see. Parking lot was adequately lit, but hotel is at the base of a terrace so houses above gave me the feeling of being watched. Got in close to midnight and there was someone at the front desk to greet me. Had my reservation down for two nights when I only book one. Got that corrected at the front desk. So for, so good, as they have a 24 hour cancellation policy. Got up to my room on the 3/4 floor via a small elevator. It reminded me of being in Ensenada, Mexico. The third and fourth floors are on a split level with the third for handicapped access. Room did not have a room number on the door so I had to lightly knock on the door hoping no one would answer. Once I got into the room, it was clean with big windows. TV didn't work well as all of the channels were fuzzy. Slept well until around 3 or 4 a.m. when plenty of loud people decided to hold a conversation outside in one of the open walkways. There was king size with plenty of pillows, both firm and soft, for a good night's sleep. Lots of road noise at all hours of the day and night. This is probably the biggest draw back of this hotel, especially when one's room faces the adjacent freeway. Got up late in the morning so I was in a hurry to leave. Had to wait for someone to check me out, just to confirm I wouldn't be charged for second night. Desk personnel were not very helpful in locating the law school. I can understand lack of knowledge of the area, but there was no effort to point me in the right direction to find out. Complementary continental breakfast was nice. The eating and serving areas were clean. I paid $160 per might through on line booking.

They had to go by the street address. Girl at check-in was very friendly and helpful as were all the other staff I encountered. Rooms were clean. Parking was sufficient. Hotel was quiet during my stay. The room was very simple with no frills. You get the basic amenities but nothing more. I think the rooms could use a bit of remodeling to feel a bit more accomodating. I was on the fifth floor, and the outside walkway faced right into the hillside and wasn't well lit at night...but at least it was quiet and not facing a noisy road. My other view was a portion of roof then Rt101. When the haze lifted enough, I was just able to make out the Hollywood sign on the distant hills. The biggest con: Location location location. At first I did not rent a car thinking I could just take the metro to the LA Convention Center since it was only two blocks away. One look at the neighborhood and I opted for the rental car. There were some homeless hanging out near the hotel and it wasn't the kind of neighborhood I would feel safe walking in well after dark. The good news in all of this is that the hotel is set up upon a hill so there is a buffer zone between the neighborhood and the hotel property. But if staying here, plan on renting a car or taking a taxi. Overall, generally pretty average. Other than the location I had no major complaints.

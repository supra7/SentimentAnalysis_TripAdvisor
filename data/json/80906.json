I was honestly surprised at how well I composed myself despite my frustration, considering how rudely he was treating me by not allowing me to finish, or even waiting to see if perhaps they had been the ones to make the mistake. They never even contacted me to tell me the card had been declined! I bit my tongue and called him \"sir\" (although in my mind I was calling him a whole host of other things), and kept asking him to allow me to finish.

Our daughter loved playing in the warm shallow pool and we could watch her from the hottub while she did say. The pool area was generally quite tidy and the couple of times we had a complaint (one time the hot tub was too cool, the other too hot) the management was very responsive and fixed it immediately. The rooms are good value. Ours was $75 a night and slept three of us.. We had a little fridge, micro and a sunken roman tub, which was basically a really giant (and somewhat slippery) bathtub. The staff was super helpful and very child friendly. They offered restaurant recommendations and things to do. The location is at the edge of town, which means about a .7 mile walk downtown. The Bad: Yes, it is a bit tired, probably why it isn't $200 a night like every other property in the area. It's a motel with pools, basically. The sofabed wouldn't have been comfortable for anybody over say 100 pounds...but for our 7 year old daughter was fine. One night, when we went to the tubs just around closing, there were a few loud drunk adults in the hot tub, but they weren't really obnoxious, just loud. The ugly: The furniture. It's pretty ugly. Long story short: If you are looking for a romantic hot springs getaway, this ain't it. If you are looking for good value accomodation in the Napa Valley with the addition of some quite nice pools that yes, have seen better days, then this might be the place for you.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alliston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTired but good value\u201d", "Author": "turtlers2", "ReviewID": "UR49850708", "Content": "We stayed twice in November 2009.

But, if you want a reasonably priced, simple place that your kids can hang out in without disturbing romantic vacationers - this will do. The real reason to stay here is the pools. There are three great hot pools - one a standard hot tub, a second \"wading\" type pool and a third standard size hotel pool - all of different temperatures. The pool area is shaded by lovely trees and gardens. Yes, there are sometimes leaves that float into the pool mid-day - but I'll take a few leaves if I can have some shade and the scent of flowers. The pool water is constantly circulating and it's great to not be in chlorine. There is some staining on the sides of the pools - it's not dirt - its from the minerals. There are nice tables and chaise lounge chairs. There were plenty of towels and they didn't make a big deal about giving you extra ones. The bed was comfortable. The location of the inn is right next to the silverado trail - a short bit from the town center - but you can still walk to restaurants. The road is busy and trucks tend to stop here, idle or hit their jake brakes right out front. I recommend asking for a room on the back side of the hotel to cut down noise. The place was empty when we were there - so also ask for a room without neighbors because the walls are thin. It seems like the staff is trying here. Someone really takes care of the garden. There is nice coffee, tea and cocoa in the front lobby. The staff checks the pools attentively. The cleaning staff was steam cleaning all of the carpets when we were there. Now, this did mean that they started moving furniture in the room next to ours at 7:30 am - but stopped when I asked. The price can't be beat for Calistoga.

There is something for everyone and i've never left disappointed or anxiety ridden. The pools are just wonderful. It feels as though you have stepped back in time because the whole pool spa area has beautifully maintained gardens and landscaping. The water is warm and rejuvenating and clean. There is a large shallow pool that is just right for younger kids. It has a shelf bench all around the edge so that all can sit and enjoy the mineral water. The larger pool is really nice too. One can choose to sit on the sun deck (no shade), at a table under a wisteria covered arbor, or in a grassy spot under a huge old tree. There is a huge whirlpool inside a cabana as well. I pretty much go for the pool experience alone but I have had several different spa treatments. They were all so enjoyable and relaxing I turn into mush just thinking about it. I have had spa treatments at other spas in the Calistoga area but this one is by far my favorite. This place is not about\"modern\" or upscale, fancy shmancy surroundings. It is about peaceful serenity and simple relaxation. The location is great . It is not in town on the main strip, but just a little past the strip, easily within walking distance. Try to reserve a room in the back( spa entrance side) that overlooks the hills in the distance. As an artist, I love to sit and sketch in the empty field here. I really enjoy this hotel. The staff is courteous and helpful. The rooms are clean and affordable. I can just see Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel staying here. I can imagine Elvis singing in the pool grotto.

One certainly wouldn't stay here if one is expecting something equivalent to the Ritz; but if one is looking for a clean, quiet, economical place in the heart of wine country, the Village Inn is the place to stay.

Jaimes and Gaye, in the office, were very friendly and accomodating. They took the time to answer our questions and make us feel at home.

Sometime after all those negative reviews were written, the management has since changed as the concierge informed us. We had a great experience there, and we're going to recommend it to everyone we know. We had purchased an off-season discount pack ($30), Discover Winter in the Wine Country, from the St. Helena Chamber of Commerce. Participating merchants in the program gave discounts and reduced prices from November through March. At the Calistoga Village Inn & Spa, we got a deluxe suite (queen bed, sitting area, whirlpool) for $59, whereas such a room would normally cost up to $179 per night. It also included a small fridge, freezer, and a microwave. We enjoyed a bubble bath in the large whirlpool tub. We saved further money (as well as avoided drinking and driving) by buying food and champagne from a St. Helena deli (Dean & Delucca) to prepare and eat in our room. The discount pack also allowed us each to have a free mud bath (normally $60) with the purchase of a full-session massage ($80 for 50 minutes). We had made reservations that morning for both accommodations and spa treatments, and I was even able to reschedule the spa treatments one hour later, due to transportation issues. After two hours of driving from the city, those spa treatments washed the road stress right out of us! Right from the door, the spa staff plunged us into a relaxing atmosphere, complete with mellow music, pleasing decor, and warm smiles. The masseurs were very attentive and meticulous. Afterwards, Imelda took great care of us with the mud bath treatment, which included the mud bath itself, a shower, a mineral water bath, and eucalpytus steam. As we went from step to step, she flushed the water from each tub in preparation for any following clients. We came out of there relaxed and with super-soft skin. The next morning we went for a dip in the three mineral water pools. Of course, we made lots of jokes about the yellow tint of the pools, but the color fits with the fact that the local mineral springs are sulfurous. The chlorine did mask the scent of the sulfur, thankfully. Our whole stay there was overall positive.

So while receiving a sea salt scrub (which is the only thing going for this place) I lifted my head and there to my amazement the male attendant is cleaning the mud area and watering the floor. When I asked why was he in this area while I'm receiving service I was told it's okay he's not looking. I felt totally disregarded and disrespected while my sisters had no problem with this I feel the need to let everyone know that if you feel uncomfortable with male attendants cleaning while receiving service this is not the place for you.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA good experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2228905", "Content": "This hotel was perfect for our stay.

Two evenings we took wine and deli food from the Palisades Market and had a picnic on the deck near the pool. The gardens were attractive, and the mood very laid back.

STAY AWAY!!!\u201d", "Author": "Brittany R", "ReviewID": "UR139319944", "Content": "We stayed here Sept 2012. It was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I called the night before we came and the lady at the front desk answered the phone. She was so rude. She sounded a little slurish like I had just woke her up. Then when we got there to check in, she was EVEN MORE RUDE! Very impatient. Got to the room and the very first thing I see was a roach crawling on the wall by the picture frame above the bed! Then, there was a smaller one on the night stand! The bathrooms were alright but this was just unacceptable. The carpet and curtains stunk like mildew. We let it slide the first night because we got there about 2 am so we were tired. The next night, we went out and those little bugs were crawling ALL OVER the front door! Needless to say, we checked out that night after the show and just went home. I felt unclean after all of that and called our trip a night short. While talking to the \"rude lady\", we told her about all of the bugs in and out of the room. Never once offered to take care of it or even refund our money for that night. I will NEVER stay here again!!!!!!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cROACHES!!!\u201d", "Author": "catlvr35", "ReviewID": "UR136423877", "Content": "We stayed at this motel July 28th and 29th, 2012.

We havent had them before.\" The room had a strange odor when we first entered, and air freshener didnt alleviate the smell.

I called to ask if they were a pet friendly facility and the clerk yelled at me and said \"I have answered you three times already\". This was my first call. When I told him I had only called once he said the man that called before me wanted to know if they allowed pets. I told him that this was the first call he had received from this number (all the time he was trying to talk through me). I ended up yelling at him and telling him that people ask that question frequently because they want to take their pets with them. (and he is still talking over me) The price and amenities would never be right enough for me to rent from this facility!", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cso-so hotel\u201d", "Author": "debbie m", "ReviewID": "UR130797398", "Content": "stayed here and it was ok.the staff made us exchange towels for towels.had to ask 3 times for extra pillows because the desk clerk acted like she did not understand me.do not think this is a great place to stay.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cotter, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGood Value - Great Managers\u201d", "Author": "sthrasher", "ReviewID": "UR50766937", "Content": "My wife and I and our 8 year old daughter were Christmas shopping in Branson, so we really just needed a place to sleep and store packages.

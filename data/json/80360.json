The room was a great value for what we paid. The staff was extremely; as they always willing to go the extra distance for what we needed including unpgrading us to a business class room when they made a mistake and booked two different groups for our original room. The location was great with restaurants such as Hunter Steakhouse and Denny's nearby plus a little quaint cafe on the hotel premises. The location was central with Qualcomm Stadium (home of the Chargers), Mission Bay + Sea World no more than five miles away & shopping centers such as Fashion Valley directly down the street.

The lobby is unimpressive. There are no restaurants in the hotel except a coffee shop. However, there is a great italian place just up the street with the best tiramisu. The staff were very friendly.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going from the train station the walk from the station is a killer as it is uphill the entire way at a significant incline. The toiletries that are supplied are nice, organic, and effective. Overall I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that this place is your best option in Seattle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re driving there are much better and cheaper options further out from the downtown core and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not you may want to consider staying at the Holiday Inn Express near the Space Needle. In the end a hotel is a place to sleep and that radiator problem makes that problematic at best so while this property has some nice touches it unfortunately fails in a fundamental way.

All the other guests had same problems, and complained with staff at the reception, but no one ever bothered neither sympathized about the situation. They were undergoing major repairs on the elevator, and they clearly should not have kept the hotel open meanwhile, especially considering the number of storeys.

If you are arriving by car, you should expect steep hills, lots of one-way streets, a lack of on street parking and (of course) traffic in Downtown Seattle. Taxi would eliminate all of those issues. I had some challenges finding it, but that was probably more about me & driving in downtown Seattle. As others have said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room was small. I found it to be plenty big enough for my purpose. See the photos. The bed was comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the covers were warm enough even though very thin and light. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying something \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I tend to be cold at night. The closet it large and has a door. That is one of those little things that I really like. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like looking at a bunch of clothes hanging in the open closets. It also comes with a safe that was easy to operate. It was really nice to be able to lock up laptop when I was away from the room. Across from the closet is the tiny, tiny bathroom (see picture). I am not usually claustrophobic, but it is so small I did not feel comfortable with the door closed. The tub is another matter. I could not decide if the tub was just old and looked tired, or if it needed a good cleaning. Fortunately, my stay was brief enough I never had to actually use it. Look at the picture and decide for yourself. Expect a few quirks just from being it being an old building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Example: the window did not seat 100% allowing some fresh air and a bit of street noise. Nothing that bothered me, but I overheard others complaining about it. Part of being an old building also means it is not good for those with mobility issues. You must go up or down about 7-10 steps to get to/from the elevator. Most people without limitations won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered by it. In the afternoon there is a complementary wine bar. That alone is a nice touch, but I was impressed as the manager is there and greets his guests personally and inquires as to how you are enjoying your stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he actually wants to know! Too many managers lock themselves away in an office somewhere. There is a coffee place off the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a separate business, but connected so you can get your morning coffee/bagel without going out in Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather. Around the corner (same building) is Jasmine: It felt like a bar and had really good Asian food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another review. The Good: * Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c friendly, helpful * Manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c goes out of his way to make sure his guests are happy (staff too) * Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Middle of downtown * Old building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c charm, details * Free wine social hour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a great way to have a glass or two and unwind after a day of meetings while we decide how to spend the evening. The Bad: * Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too far (walking) from the main restaurant area, or waterfront. * Old building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not accessible, showing its age * Questionable cleaning?

I reserved their \"deluxe suite\" which was quite small (I'd hate to see what the standard room looks like, probably a closet). It was only manageable for a single traveler. The bed was comfortable and the TV had a nice array of channels. The bathroom was quite small as well and not built for someone over 5ft6. You cannot close the door without lifting up your knees if you are on the commode. The tub appeared to be stained which wasn't very nice to look at but the shower was nice. I found the heat/ac unit to be rather old and clunky. You cannot do much to control either. There is just a fan option. When I arrived the room was super hot and stuffy. The window only opens 6 inches (to prevent people from jumping since the room is so hot I assume) so it took a while for the room to air out and cool down. The front desk staff seemed rather aloof and disinterested in their customers as well. Do not use the vending machines in the hotel, they charge $2.00 for a can of soda!! Instead, take a walk to the Bartels drugstore just a few blocks south of the hotel and purchase beverages and snacks. On the bright side, the fabulous Seattle Public Library is right next door and there is decent WiFi in the room. This hotel is best for those who do not plan on driving since parking is expensive and minimal. One guest was given the incorrect parking instructions and was told he had to pay $87 for parking since the staff told him the wrong complex so beware if you are parking there, make sure you are given directions to the absolute correct complex. Also, Spring Street is a pretty vertical hill so if you are walking there from a Light Rail terminal, stay on 4th or 5th Ave to avoid having to walk up that crazy hill with your luggage. Other than that, it was an okay stay.

I'd made the reservation for two people a few months before, and when he asked to bring my nephew, I called the 1-800 number to see if cots were available. \"Yes,\" said the operator, \"but let me connect you to the local hotel so you can have it ready for you.\" The local hotel contradicted this: \"We don't have any cots, but we can give you extra blankets.\" Fine. He brought his own cot. We arrived early and checked our bags; check-in was uneventful and the bellhop was friendly and eager to help. I returned to the hotel to get keys several hours later; no problem. The room was small, as I expected, but in several places had paint chips coming off the walls. The hot and cold water on the sink was reversed. The window overlooking the library across the street was dusty and had gunk in the tracks. The frosted glass bathroom door had liquid marks at various heights. I don't want to wonder what the waist-level liquid marks came from. When my brother arrived, he called down for the blankets for the cot. \"We don't have any,\" said the desk. A hotel without blankets? Really? Fine. We pulled the comforter off the bed and let my nephew use it on his cot. I was fine with just a sheet until about 2 AM. The air conditioning works really, really well. The next morning, I was the first one in the shower. The water was up to my shins when I finished -- it wouldn't drain a drop. I messed with the drain plug in the murky water, but couldn't get it to a point where I could hear any water draining out. My brother messed with it, using the drain plug as a plunger, and got it to drain slowly. Ewww for him. We called maintenance, who fixed it while we were out, but seriously, isn't that something that housekeeping would have noticed the last time they cleaned the tub? Unless they don't clean the tub... On the way out that morning, my brother stopped housekeeping and asked them for an extra blanket. They were happy to provide one. If the hotel has no extra blankets, as the front desk said, I wonder who in the hotel had to sleep without one that night. We ate breakfast at the Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs. They were as good as expected. The rest of the stay was uneventful. The front desk was happy to split charges across my brother's and my credit cards, and the bell desk was efficient at checking our bags again. It's really got the feel of a two-star place that might have been a three-star place many years ago.

We didn't have a problem with this at all, although we did stay on a Wednesday night so it could be a different story on the weekend. I did hear a couple voices in the hallway in the morning, so I could see how if there were people around being loud you would be able to hear them. Now I will start from the beginning. They have a loading zone right in front of the hotel so that you can check in and unload your stuff before parking, which was very nice. We had a quick and easy check in and the guy even asked which floor we would like to stay on which I thought was nice, we ended up on 4. We used the self park parking which ended up being $23 cause there was tax since it was charged with your room, but that covered us from 4:30 when we checked in till 9pm the next day, amazing! Also some of the reviews made it sound like the parking garage was blocks away, there is an alley separating the hotel and the garage, they're right next to each other. I don't know what people were complaining about. The rooms are a bit on the small side but they look nice and we had all the room we needed. There is A/C in the room that seemed to work just great, we turned it off cause we got too cold. The beds were comfortable, I slept like a baby. Our only complaints were that there aren't fans in the bathrooms which makes it really difficult to clear the steam after a shower, and the bathroom door was rather loud to open and close because the doors are very old. The shower heads are fabulous though.

We selected the hotel as our starting point for our visit to the Pacific Northwest prior to our Alaskan cruise. The Hotel's location, it's nightly stay price point and it's website photos of the hotel were major factors for our choice of this property. We reserved two rooms online and got superb rates by navigating to the Manager's special section of their website. Our nightly room rate was $110.00 + tax and was a very good find for the location in the downtown of Seattle. The rooms were smartly decorated and took advantage of some of the historical features of the property like the vintage inset tiles in the floors of the bathrooms. Guests will find ample hot water in the bathrooms and the guest ammenities (towels, shampoos, soaps, etc.) were top quality.

I asked if it was of a comparable quality to their hotel, they said yes, of course. It's absolutely not - it's a budget hotel with peeling, paint, dirty carpets, and smells like urine. I asked if it was still in a downtown location, they said yes, it was only a few min away from the Executive Pacific. It is not, it's at least a 20 min walk away and in a completely different, run-down part of the city on the fringe of down town.

It is not - my room overlooks a parking lot and a highway, and the only things next to this hotel are a police station and a McDonalds. They proceeded to whisk me into a cab, they women from the front desk said \"Don't worry, we'll tell the cab driver where to drop you off\" - the cab then dropped me off at the Pan Pacific hotel, who, when I tried to check in there, informed me they had no idea what I was talking about. The *very nice* staff at the Pan Pacific then called the Hotel Executive to figure out what the hell was going on, and then informed me that the cab took me to the completely wrong hotel. They were also nice enough to have their town car drop me off at the 6th Avenue Inn at no charge, and the driver even accompanied me into the lobby to make sure that I had arrived at the right location this time! The Pan Pacific was booked solid, which is too bad, because they were absolutely lovely and I would have just stayed there! Once I arrived at the 6th Ave Inn and discovered it was COMPLETELY NOT what had been described to me by the Pacific staff, nor was it in any way worth the price I was paying per night at the Pacific, I called the Pacific and said that at this point I was exhausted and very upset, and they really needed to do something to rectify the situation - I did not want to spend the night in a room that smelled like urine. (No offense, 6th AVE - I will say that the people at your front desk were also lovely and kind to me - It seems every hotel in Seattle has professional staff EXCEPT for the Hotel Pacific.... Hm.) The woman who answered the phone informed me that there were no supervisors at the hotel in the evenings (Excuse me??? Are you kidding me??). After some back and forth, she agreed to call her manager's cell phone, but he or she did not pick up so now I am stuck at the 6th Ave Inn, it's already 8:30pm (and my body thinks it's 11:30pm EST), and apparently I'm having dinner tonight at McDonalds.

It's literally a block or two away from the station (I took the Link Rail from Sea/Tac to Downtown in 30 minutes for only $2.50). It's a short 5 to 8 minute walk to Pike Place, a MUST SEE if you're going to be in Seattle for any reason. The location is also perfect if you're wanting to go to nice restaurants and close to several interesting bars. It is also a 8 to 10 minute walk to the two malls: Westlake Center and Pacific Place. As I spent most of the time in Seattle wandering around and taking in the sites, I was only in my hotel room late at night and in the early morning. The hotel was fairly nice, it wasn't dirty or gross, but it wasn't like I was expecting anything too luxurious and I wasn't disappointed. The only real complaint I have about the place is that the rooms get a bit too hot and stuffy. The weather outside was nice and cool and the temperature in the room was the opposite. The first night, I turned on the a/c thinking it would cool some while I slept, but I woke up several times because it was hot and had to sleep without a blanket. I was able to open the window a few inches, and even left it open the entire day while I was out, but the room's temperature was still a little uncomfortable. Other than that, the staff was really friendly. I asked someone at the front desk about good bars and restaurants to go to and he provided me with a map and circled all his favorite places.

Of course I spoke to them and shut them up, but the point is the hotel is so old, the walls are 'paper thin'. Our room also faced 4th Ave and the street noise was quite loud. We could not sleep with the window open as a result but even when closed the sounds were loud. A little money spent soundproofing is in order. Our room with two double beds was also quite small and short of space. But again, it is an older hotel. The staff are all wonderful, and the location great, but your money is better spent elsewhere.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go expecting anything fancy but the location is wonderful and the rooms are fine. However there are a few things about this hotel that are not mentioned when you book a room that are important to know. First of all the hotel parking lot is almost 30 dollars a night. Second they do NOT have any sort of AC until May. Thirdly, and in my opinion, most importantly do not stay in room 801. The 8th floor is hot, stuffy, and gets very little ventilation. The 8th floor is very hot and and with no AC it is kind of an uncomfortable stay. Also you have to keep the window open, which happens to overlook the parking lot, which means it is also very noisy. However the one thing that was just ridiculous was the room, 801. We were booked in this stuffy and warm room with no AC, but that was bearable. However, 801 is also adjacent to the elevator motor. If you stay in this room I guarantee you will hear the grind of the motor starting every time someone uses it. Therefore we had the window open, the motor of the elevator, and drunks in the hallway (not the hotels fault), all night. Was my worst hotel night stay ever (and that includes sketchy hostels in Europe). However when I called the front desk at 4 am crying because I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep they moved me promptly. Therefore my biggest advice to people staying here is to request any floor but the 8th and DO NOT stay in room 801 unless you like constant noise.

The staff is kind and quick with checking guests in but when I got up to my room there were a few issues that I wouldnt have expected - the pillow covers and duvet were dingy and looked stained; like they could have used a good bleaching or perhaps the hotel should invest in a new set. One of the lamps in the room did not turn on at all, and the window facing the main street wouldnt open. There was a small window in the bathroom that when opened did not have a screen and was close to a floor of the parking gagarge. It wouldnt have been difficult for someone to climb from the garage to the window and in - being a solo female traveler this is not something I would want to worry about. The mattress was lumpy and worn, with deep indends on the left and right that had been worn in over time with a high stiff ridge in the middle. The hotel could have if not purchsed newer mattress', flipped the ones they have to ensure a more comfortable nights sleep. Parking is in the Olimpic Garage, a short walk around the corner, but you have to take a short flight of stairs up to the elevators that take you to the parking levels - not comvieniet with luggage. The rental car I had for the trip was also broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras and is not well patroled. There was broken window glass in other parking spaces and all the staff of the garage did was sweep it up.

I put in a request for a quiet room and they fulfilled that: I was given a room on one of the topmost floors in the corner and it had a breathtaking view of the Bay and City.

There was a retro bathroom, high quality bathroom products, very chic accents throughout the room and it was well lit! There was a huge desk and comfy chair, flat screen TV, and the king bed was gigantic and extremely comfortable. I would always call the front desk with my questions and they would always ask me.

You are also steps from the harbor (~ 5 minutes), aquarium, and all that good stuff! It is a beautiful location and very safe especially at night since there is a hotel guard at the front.

I waited for nearly 15 minutes before I called the front desk, only to be put on hold for another 5 minutes before I hung up. I called back and asked if they could send out a parking attendant. I was advised he was parking cars... it should be noted that not a single car was moved during the 20+ minutes I sat out front, double parked. When the parking attendant came out, he got my name and took my car away; that's all that was said, He didn't even offer to help with my bags. I'm not a fan of tipping parking attendants when the price of parking in the city is so high anyway, but he for sure wasn't getting a tip. When I went in to the desk, there was one young man and he was incredible busy. There didn't seem to be anyone else in the lobby, but the phones were crazy. It took another 15 minutes for me to get checked in because he had to keep putting me on hold to answer the phone. And while he was nice, he was in a lose-lose situation. Not to mention, he had a visible arm tattoo. I have tattoos and I love them, but I felt it was inappropriate for a front desk clerk to have one visible. On an up note, I wasn't aware my rate included SELF-park and not valet. If there had been a parking attendant out front when I arrived, maybe I could have realized this. But the attendant just came to my car, asked my name, and drove away. I was used to this and he didn't ask me if I had valet or self park. When I was checking in, it was discovered that I had used valet services but only paid for self park. The tattooed desk clerk was nice enough to upgrade me at no additional charge for the misunderstanding. When I got in to the elevator, the walls were fabric that was worn and looked very dirty. I'm sure it was clean, but it didn't look like it. On my way to my room, there was a painter in the hall painting the baseboards. He didn't make any effort to move aside, and the hallways are pretty narrow. So I went around. When I arrived in my room, the first thing I noticed was how small the bathroom was. I have a thing for bathrooms, and this was small, cute, and charming. And again, while I'm sure it was clean, there were areas I questioned. The grout in between the little tiles on the floor was dingy and appeared to be dirty. I think this is from lack of maintenance. Also, there was a vertical pipe along the wall; at the base of the pipe there appeared to be something that looked like insulation or something, only it was tattered and painted over; it looked really gross. The wood baseboards were sort of torn up (again, lack of maintenance), but they had been painted over. Newsflash... painting over tattered wood doesn't clean up the look of the wood; it only becomes painted tattered wood. Like the fabric in the elevator, the carpet looked dingy and dirty. The room was small, but sufficient for one person, sorta crowded for two. What really upset me were the window shears. One window was above the air conditioner (which was loud) and when I went over to turn the air on, I noticed black spots at the bottom of the shears. I can only assume this was mold, give the look and the location. Also, the headboard was a padded feaux leather-type material that was all worn and scratched up. Not attractive at all. And while I don't frequent the honor bar items, I had forgotten my tooth brush and craved some saltiness in the middle of the night. Things were expensive, as they go with honor bars, but the products still weren't great quality. It seemed like the entire honor bar was stocked from bulk items from Costco. The noise in the hallway and neighboring rooms was loud for a weeknight; I would imagine a weekend night would be worse. And when I checked out, it took the valet another 15 minutes to bring my car around; there were no other people waiting. When he finally got there with my car, I loaded my luggage, again... he didn't offer to help, and he had the nerve to \"linger\" as if he was expecting a tip. Sorry, buddy, but I just paid nearly 30 bucks for parking one night; if you wanna tip, you're gonna have to take care of my bags. This was one night; I had a second night scheduled here a few days later. Let's just say, this hotel left an impression on me... one that caused me to call and cancel my second night and rebook at another in the same area. I paid more at my new place, but it was worth it.

The window needed to be washed and some of the furniture is approaching the time when it needs to be replaced. The tub drain was extremely slow. Like a lot of hotels, the walls were too thin, but our neighbors quieted down, so we did not have to complain about it.

The shower was atrocious for me mainly because the shower-head was chest level for goodness sake and wasn't adjustable. The parking was terrible mainly because there was very little in the way of that. The hotel provided maybe 6 parking spots for 9 floors of guests. NOT WORTH IT.

Beautiful weather (surprisingly), and a fabulous location for the work I was doing, but the hotel lurched between quirky and decrepit (and occasionally sullenly incompetent) depending on my mood... The entrance area is split across three levels, which require either a downstairs drag or an upstairs hike with your luggage (the porter can be seen running away into the left luggage room as you approach). The reception is polite but unhelpful as they don't really cater for the sort of needs travellers may have (Power adapter? No. Stamps? Of course not). They issue two room cards despite there being only me, and they had actually booked out four rooms for a total of 16 nights for us (though this may not be their fault). The rooms are definitely small, especially by American standards, but would it really have hurt to provide a suitcase stand to help out with the squeeze? The bathroom was a very tight fit (and I am tall and felt I had to concertina up to sit down), but more or less functional. The 'robe' provided would barely have covered my modesty if I could have got it around my shoulders (more like a souvenir tea towel), and I wonder if this is a favourite trick of hotels to save themselves doing a bit of laundry. Did they not notice they had put a size 0 robe in a big man's room? Had a great view of the Koolhuis Library next door, and was across the hall from the very small 'Cardio Room' that has one running machine, one cross trainer and one stationary bike, as well as the ubiquitous television set that Americans can't seem to operate without. Free WiFi didn't function for most of my stay. Had a couple of drinks in the downstairs bar, but having to call the lift and struggle with its doors (both opening and closing) is a bit ridiculous when you are only on the second floor. The internal decor of Jasmine's bar is for seventies glam nostalgics only, and if you were there then, it is likely that if you left anything tucked under the sofas it is probably still there. American service always amuses me because they promise so much (and so cheerfully) and delivers so little (with serious expressions that suggest the end of the world could not be put off quite long enough to do you the service they said they would). In general, despite an apparently recent multi-milllion pound refit, this place gives the impression of a run down flop house, with a blind interior decorator getting the gig.

I had stayed there before and recommended my friend book on the basis of my last stay, which was reasonable. But that was definitely not the case this time around. There were so many disappointing things about our weekend at the Executuve Hotel Pacific........ 1.We were placed in a room directly opposite the elevators on the 5th floor. The noise from the elevators and other guests returning home until the early hours of the morning was very loud (and i am usually a heavy sleeper, and i could still hear it clearly , on and off, throughout the night). Also the cleaning staff made such a racket in the morning it was difficult to sleep past 7am. 2.We made a specific online request to have a small fridge in the room for medications. This was obviously ignored online, as were our pleas to have something done about it when we checked in. Previously, in other similar hotels, we were offered a small portable fridge/cooler for the exact same purpose. 3. The air conditioning did \"work\" (ie turn on) but produced a worrying, burning smell when it was turned on (as if it had not been used for weeks). So we tried to open the window which was stuck down, so we could only open in a few cm to try and let some cool, fresh air into the now stuffy room. 4. The bathroom was small, but the size itself wasn't the main issue. The shower head had virtually no pressure and the toilet was VERY, VERY noisy every time we flushed (and we could hear the toilets of adjacent rooms quite clearly too). Very old, poor plumbing. 5. When we suggested to the front desk staff that they should move us because of all of the above reasons, they said they were fully booked for our first night but could change our rooms for the second night. We agreed. When we presented to the front desk for our new room the next day, the new staff member stated nothing had been documented in their book about a room change, and again they were booked out so they could not help us. In fact, they freely admitted that they had just used up the last room for the guest who checked in minutes before, and they had overbooked...so they still had to find rooms for 4 guests who had yet to check-in. Not something that i imagine a reputable hotel does(or admits to their other guests!). So all up, we were glad to check-out and will not be returning to this hotel.

Noise was a definite problem and I would not have booked here if they had been honest with me as I had been with them about the purpose of our stay. They could have done so much to avoid the situation by putting us in a corner or end room as I book (2) suites! I talked to a hotel representative letting her know my disappointment since I had arranged this ahead of time but also my understanding of other guests since the hotel did not plan well and asked it we could be moved, etc. She responded very annoyed and was not open to any resolution besides us going to sleep....it was around 9:50pm on a Saturday night and we had about an hour left of our shower. To make matters worse both rooms that we stayed in were prank called. From 1am-3am the phones would ring and when we would answer it was just hold music. These calls could not have come from guest rooms (we tried calling each other) as the guest room phones did not have a hold button. It got so bad that we had to unplug the phones but needless to say that we did not get any sleep. When I asked at checkout if they had been having any troubles with their phones they said they were working just fine. Granted I have no proof that the hotel made these calls, but it seems very unlikely that both our rooms would have this problem and that hold music would be in the back ground.

It was the only one available when we booked through United vacations. Other unavailable possibilities are located close by. My first impression when we arrived from the airport at 1am was that the decor was dull and dreary, and our mood wasn't helped by the necessity to drag our cases down a small flight of steps to reach the elevator. The overall decor of the hotel and the room reminded me of the build up to the \"Tower of Terror\" ride at Disney -- dark, less than welcoming, with an old fashioned lift. The room on the 8th floor was ok, but there were black marks on the lower part of the walls where items, or feet, had inadvertently connected. Our room was also too close to the lift, and we could hear the lift mechanism. Like some other reviewers, we could hear people in the next room without much difficulty. In hindsight, maybe we should have asked for a better room, but we figured that we weren't going to be in the room much, so we'd persevere. You can't fault the location. It's right next to the city centre and the public market, and the tour buses pick you up from the hotel. There are some good restaurants within two or three blocks, because the hotel only has a coffee shop. We fell in lucky, we were in Seattle on the night of the excellent Torchlight procession (unintentionally). There's 900,000 people live in Seattle, and half of them must have been in the procession! The people are nice and friendly, the trips we had were excellent, but the next time we go to Seattle, we won't be staying at the Exec Pacific -- unless the owners put their hands in their pockets and pay for a much needed major refurbishment.

We chose this hotel because it was affordable and in a prime location. For travelers who are only going to be using thier hotel room to sleep and shower, this is a great choice. It is not a luxury hotel, but a practical choice for active tavelers. Here's what we thought of the hotel: PROS: -Location, location, location. The hotel is across the street from the stunning Seattle Library, and within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, and the waterfront. -Affordable. Of all the downtown hotels we looked at this was the least expensive. -Friendly staff. The front desk attendants helped us make the most of our stay by recommending restaurants and calling taxis. Also, they offer complimentary maps, and will loan you an umbrella to use for the day. -Newly renovated. The hotel is certainly old, but they have made an effort to update the look with new modern furnishings. The down comforters on the bed were wonderful! -Clean. Although there was a faint smell of old smoke in the hall, our room and bath was neat and clean. I saw no signs of mold or dirt. CONS: -It's Small. The lobby, the rooms, the bathrooms--they're all small. My sister and I were able walk around comfortably, but there's certainly no extra space. I think it would feel cramped if there were more than two guests in a room. -It's a Buget Hotel. Travelers who are used to the luxury of larger resort hotels will be dissapointed. However, as I've said before, if you're only using the hotel room to sleep and shower, it's more than adequate. -It's Old. While they have made an effort to revamp the hotel, there's no hiding the fact that the building itself is old. There was a faint smell of old smoke in the halls and the doors have obviously been painted many times. Carpet, furniture, and bathroom fixtures, however, are new. -Street noise. While street noise will be a problem in any downtown hotel, this hotel doesn't have the thicker windows that many of the newer hotels are installing. The noise wasn't enough to keep us from sleeping. Overall, a great pick if you're looking for a clean, affordable place to crash before hitting the town again.

Just the month prior we had stayed there for 5-days along with my father for my son's graduation and had a great time. The majority of the staff was quite friendly and inviting. The price was very affordable, the rooms were nice and the location was amazing for our needs. The only challenge I encountered was when I reserved the room and asked the very nice reservationists that confirmation be directed via e-mail so I could forward my fathers for his itinerary as he was traveling up from California. I was assured this would occur, it did not. For the most part the experience was great; so I had been talking up this property with is affordability and location. When I needed to return for business, I again selected this property due to the positive experience three weeks prior. Although, this time I booked my reservation on-line through a third party so that I would immediately receive a confirmation as well as itinerary for my travels and that is exactly what occurred. I called the property in advance to confirm arrangements and informed them that we would be bringing our dog again. They confirm acknowledgement. Upon arriving at the property, I mentioned that we were returning after just three weeks of our previous visit, of which was acknowledged. We were assigned our room, which when we entered we were not quite so impressed. The room was located in a wing of the hotel, where at the end of the hallway there were four rooms clustered and there were hand written signs on the room doors around ours stating that they were painting. It was located on the same floor as our previous room, although rather than a king bed there was a queen. The room was very small and cramped with a view of all of the back of the house workings and systems, although we would not be staying long so this was not a big issue. From the time we checked in until I needed to leave for my event at 5:00pm, there was the sound of possibly a paint sprayer, which did not cause too much discomfort. We returned back at the hotel at approximately 11:30pm, very tired from a total of 4-days of travel and early to late events. We slept just fine until promptly at 7:47am we were awaken by the sounds of staff yelling back and forth to each other. This stopped for about 50 minutes until it again began. We decided it was time to pack up and leave anyway, so no big deal (I guess?). My husband took the dog out for a walk and then to put her in the car while I continued to prepare for our departure. He came back to tell me that when he went back to our car, he found that it had been broken into. He contacted the garage attendant and was told that it was a 17 level garage and this happens all the time. This is the only offered parking by the hotel. At this point, weighing out the entire experience in such a limited stay, I was now feeling quite disappointed and decided to share my experience with management. So upon check out I asked the very nice front desk attendant if I could speak with a manager in regards to my experience and she stated that she was the Front Desk Supervisor and did I wish to speak with the General Manager. I told her I was comfortable speaking with her if she was comfortable with that and she then could share with her GM. She said yes. I went on to explain my entire experience, of which she empathized and then I added that it appeared apparent to me that I was penalized by booking through a third party with the room assignment and even when the opportunity was raised to upgrade me, no one chose to and I was quite confident their hotel was not at 100% occupancy. I also stated that they new there would be construction noise and that they could have given me the option of whether I would or would not be bothered by it in advance. She did not argue these facts. She offered to credit the parking charge and said that she would have credited my room night charge, but that I had already paid????? That was just insult to injury at that point. I do have to say that after all was said and done we were treated better by the parking garage management, who graciously offered to vacuum out all of the glass in our car from the window the thief broke at no charge, so that we could let our dog in I have been in the hotel management business for the past 10-years and believe I have an understanding point of view, although all and all, I have never have my patronage so unappreciated. The hotel has so much potential and I understand that it just recently changed ownership/management in July. But they need to remember that they just need to make people feel special and that goes a long way to the guest experience, regardless of the things that are out of their direct control. It has now been three weeks and I have not had any follow-up from the hotel.

We enjoyed the easy access to everything so much that we left the car parked in the parking lot for 4 days. Yes, it did cost $18 a day to park. Ouch. The lobby/mezzanine area was actually bright, large and inviting. It was more contemporary and newer with sofa/reading area and free internet computers.

My trip to Seattle was perfect, except for having to stay at this perfectly horrid place. We had a corner \"suite\" which was actually a tiny room with hardly enough room to get around the incredibly hard and lumpy bed. The bathroom was so small that we had to take turns at the sink, as two people will not fit in there at the same time unless one person stands in the tub! It was cold the night we stayed, and the heat didn't work. Housekeeping walked into the room at 8 a.m without waiting for us to answer the door, just knocked once and came right in! As for location, it was probably once a charming hotel. It sits up on the hill right across the street from the public library. It's a good 8 or more blocks down to the waterfront, which isn't so bad going down, but it's quite a trek to walk back up--this is not a small hill, it's very steep, so look forward to getting in some cardio during your stay. And pack comfortable shoes, it's at least two miles to the space needle. Don't get roped into the \"suite with deluxe breakfast\" deal, either. The deluxe breakfast consists of a small drip coffee and a muffin at the coffee shop downstairs. All in all, including taxes, we paid almost $200 a night for a cup of coffee and a room that rates no better than a Motel 6. For the price, I've had much, much better accomodations. My best suggestion after seeing the area, stay at the Marriott on the waterfront. It's only a few dollars more, just steps from the Pike St. Market, and sits on the water. The rooms are gorgeous (and HUGE!) and it's central to everything. We also had dinner at a place called The Brooklyn. Highly recommend. Stellar service, and amazing food.

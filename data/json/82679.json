Ended up staying for a little less than a week, I have been able to accumulate the following review: 1-Location The hotel is located 30 min away from Los Angeles in a nice suburb called Woodland Hills. It is not an exciting place to be in as it does not offer good entertainment as you would expect from being closer to the city. You definitely need a car to commute back and forth to the exciting location around town. On the other hand, it is situated in the middles of a commercial area where a lot of bars, fast food outlets, and a Westfield shopping mall are just in close proximity. The only close entertainment attraction is Universal Studios which is approximately 20 min away by car. 2- The hotel It looks a lot like a motel complex rather than a hotel. It is composed of a circle shaped like building with rooms distributed on two stories. The ground level is too close to the parking area and you wills ably get awaken by the car noises or shouts of gets getting in Late. The upper level is not much better off as oh will keep on getting hit by the noise of cars and guests. The hotel does not scre high on its appearance, you will definitely not find sofitel's glamour or Westin's magic. If you are looking for luxury, that pace is definitely not where you want to stay. 3-Rooms This is probably the best scoring part of the complex. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, a very large bed is situated in the middle with a big TV screen just centered around your sleeping area. Rooms come with a sofa at the entrance next to the door and Re equipped with the accessories you would find in most hotels, from a coffee machine to a fridge... While the equipment might be a little old with signs of usage, the TV is not even plasma and there are no DVD decks attached or iPod docking station. The AC and heating system is situated just under the window, it is very effective at cooling the room or heating it up, but it is very noisy and you might want to turn it off before you sleep to avoid getting awaken by a loud flow of air getting on every 10 min 4- Services There are not much services offered in the hotel. But at least the net is free. Distributed over wi-fi, it remains at very high speed and accessible all day long. I find this as a big plus as still lots of 5 star hote S still charge you for the net. Breakfast is also available for free with the room, but served I. The breakfast area next to the rectilinear. That area only has one table and will definitely fit 4 or 5 guests, so don't expect to be sitting on a table enjoying coffee. It is intended to just grab what you want and be on your way. It is also worth noting that you need to step out in the open and walk to the reception, not much of a thing during winter. 5- Personel They are surely worthy of a 5 star hotel. I love smily helpful hosts. I was greeted with a big smie by really lovely front dek officers who were more than kind in explaining everything about the hotel and the area. They did not hesitate in offering me all the assistance I needed, they even called after my check in to see if everything is fine. Room service Personel are also very kind and really friendly. All in all I rate this place a s a 3, it is very average and definitely a place you will stay in if you are on a budget or because you have an occasion in the surrounding area. If you intend to see more of Los Angeles without commuting and enduring the endless freeway traffic of LA, you definitely need to stay close to Hollywood", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menifee, California", "Title": "\u201cWe stay here when flying from LAX\u201d", "Author": "cmdevenney", "ReviewID": "UR122799733", "Content": "We like to stay here when we are flying from LAX, this hotel is about 30-40 min from the airport depending on traffic. it is conveniently located near the 101 freeway.

The old polynesian tiki facade is gone and replaced by a more modern, semi-mediterranean style front. The rooms have also been overhauled, with the addition of crown moulding and new carpeting, fresh paint, etc. Unfortunately, the seamy underbelly of the Aku Aku still shows. We stayed here two nights in early October, displaced from downtown Los Angeles by the convergence of two major college football games and a baseball playoff game all on the same weekend. This was as close as we could get and still keep the nightly tab under $110 without getting head lice. First few signs were bad omens; the magnetic keys did not work, so I headed back to the lobby to have them re-programmed. Second try was a little better, but still only one of the keys worked. When we entered the room, it looked alright. The pictures on the website looked much better, though. Sure, they had spent some money on crown moulding, paint, and carpeting. It was obvious that the money spent on those features came out of the bedding and linens budget. The sheets seemed thin and threadbare, the towels were of a motel 6 quality, kind of coarse and thin. Little things, like table lamps not quite matching their \"motif\", and having internet, but not wireless internet. They seemed to have run out of money before they could get this place to a 3-star level. Then, around 2pm, the locals starting congregating outside the liquor store directly across the street. Pretty soon the car stereo with the stadium sound bass woofers was shaking down the motel room. A call to the desk brought no results, as the problem was \"off the property\". After about 45 minutes the concert ended and the crowd dispersed. The ballyhooed breakfast bar was a bust. Two bins of cereal, doughy cheap bagels and muffins, one waffle machine with a line 5 people long waiting to use it, etc. We headed across the street and bought some decent pastry and coffee at Coffee Bean and Tea. The final insult was upon leaving; our 16 year old daughter left her orthodonture retainer on the table between the beds. As soon as we got home that night we realized it had been left at the motel, and called the night clerk. The maid would be in the next morning and they would check and call us back. No call. We called again, and were summarily told that the retainer was \"not found\" (i.e. thrown out). Oh well. Should have spent the extra money and stayed in L.A.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBest Bang For Your Buck!!\u201d", "Author": "Canadians33", "ReviewID": "UR18519576", "Content": "Our wonderful experience began at check-in with the friendly and helpful staff. The newly renovated hotel reminded us of a mexican retreat. The two story building bodded large spacious rooms with a very comfortable bed. Rooms were extremely clean and the cleaning staff were accommodating to our needs of additional towels and linen. Besides the wonderful rooms, the outdoor pool and hot tub was an oasis within themselves. The other added benefit to this hotel is its proximity to the highway and special attractions. Be sure to bring a GPS so that you can avoid traffic jams by putting in alternative routes which seem to be just as quick. Besides the free parking on site, our daily included breakfast was one we looked forward to everyday. The variety of options from homemade waffles to cereal and bagels, were a great boost to start the day. Jerry's Deli accross the street was a great restaurant offering a variety of food and huge portions. Ralph's Grocery Store is also across the street for alcohol and their must have delicious bagels.

P.S. While I express my apologies to the reviewer before me for what she experienced, I'd also be remiss as a veteran traveler if I didn't point out that some of it was preventable. The first line of defense is to look over paperwork CAREFULLY before signing/initialing it at check-in. I've caught wrong in and out dates, wrong rates, or both on a few occasions over the years\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand have rectified it on the spot. Then check it again first thing in the morning and resolve if needed. The second line is that if any nonfood, nonmeltable items of nominal or higher value were purchased expressly for the vacation, leave it locked up in the cool part of the car. Retrieve then only when needed. The third line is that if leaving the room for a few hours in the morning with an expected return around the time guests are checking out, make sure that \"Do Not Disturb\" or \"Privacy, Please\" sign is hanging or (in the case of this particular property) inserted into the keycard reader before departing for that short period.

I had arranged for a suite with 2 queen beds anticipating it would be similar to a place we had stayed in Anaheim - 2 separate rooms with a bed in each room and a separate sitting area with kitchen amenities. I was wrong . . . it is one typical hotel room with two queen beds next to each other and a half room with a small hide-a-bed, tv, and wet bar. When we arrived, we were told the people who had occupied the room the night before had extended their stay another night, so we were offered one room with two queen beds or two rooms and hotel staff would move us the following day. We chose the one room. The beds were like rocks! I've never slept on such hard mattresses!! The next day the hotel staff moved our belongings into the suite while we were out, but didn't move my daughter's pillow. When we realized it wasn't there, the person at the front desk wasn't able to help us because he said he was the only person on duty and that he would have to contact the housekeeping staff who had all gone home at this point. We also needed a toothbrush which they advertised as being a complementary service if you forgot yours, but we were told they were all out. We also had problems with the internet cable - it worked in one room, but not the other. Again, the person at the front desk wasn't able to help us. Fortunately, there was a shift change and the next front desk person was able to explain that the internet cable only worked in one room and they retrieved the missing pillow. We went out and bought our own toothbrush. The location of the hotel is right on Ventura Blvd. - a VERY BUSY street - and you are only allowed to make a right turn when leaving the hotel. This is definitely a disadvantage if you need to go the opposite direction. There is a side gate to the parking lot, which would allow you access to points west, but it is locked shut. The property should install something in the ground which would open it when a car approached from the inside for the convenience of its guests! A couple more comments - the mattresses in the suite were a little softer, but by the end of our stay, my body ached from sleeping in the bed. The mattress on the hide-a-bed was very thin and when my daughter laid on it, she felt the bar right through it. She ended up sleeping on it as a couch. AND the water temp in the shower was either hot or scalding! There was no cold water! I must say the price of the room and the fact they offered a suite with 2 queen beds was the reason I chose this property. It wasn't worth it. I wouldn't stay here again. Sorry Best Western.

Traveling with our dog, we usually stay at the Days Inn, La Quinta Inn or similar hotel that allows pets to stay. This trip, we were not traveling with our dog, so decided to stay in a little bit nicer hotel. We choose Comfort Inn and Suites West because of the convenient location. To be honest, I didn't expect that it would be much different than the Days Inn. I was pleasantly surprised. Check-in was fast and efficient. They had our reservations with all information accurate. The reception staff is very friendly and eager to please. Our room was very large and clean. The bed and pillows were wonderful. The towels were abundant, thick and soft. The room, not a suite, had a large TV, refrigerator, small coffee service and microwave. The bathroom had travel supplies such as shampoo and lotion. There is a \"Breakfast Room\" conveniently located near the main lobby. They provided the usual \"continental\" breakfast including coffee, juices (apple and orange), cereal including raisin bran, cheeries and fruitloops, skim and 2% milk, fresh fruit including bananas, apples and oranges, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, and waffles. They also provide 2 choices of scrambled eggs (with or without cheddar cheese), biscuits and gravy on one day, plus sausage and O'Brien potatoes the second day. (We were there only 2 days, so there may be other choices during the week.) It was a big selection for a free breakfast. The breakfast room was kept clean and well supplied by an attendant. There were lots of tables inside, plus a deck with extra tables outside. Also a large screen TV inside, plus USA Today was available inside. The facilities include a large swimming pool and hot tub enclosed in a building separate from the lobby area. The grounds are nicely maintained. I saw people sweeping up trash from the parking lot. You can tell that the management takes pride in maintaining their facility to a high standard. Check-out was just as efficient, plus they sent a \"Thankyou\" email for staying with them. That was a nice touch. We will definitely return.

I booked a 2 room suite, and requested an early check in and was told that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. A few days before arriving I was pleasantly surprised to receive a friendly letter from the hotel which included a list of shows and times that they could book for me. When I arrived I was able to check in early as planned. I was given the Silver Maple Suite, a 2 room (bed room and living room) suite which included 2 separate full bath rooms, 2 entries, 2 flat screen tvs, a micro wave, icebox, queen size bed, couch with fold out bed, and a Jacuzzi. The room was very clean, comfortable and well stocked with various miscellaneous items. The staff was very courteous and helpful offering ideas of things to see and do in town. The pool room was also very nice, very clean, stocked with clean towels, the room temperature was very comfortable and the water was very clean, warm and didn\u2019t smell of chlorine like most pools do. The hot tub was nice, not to hot; it seemed to gradually get warmer the longer you stayed but never to hot. On my 3 day I tried out the breakfast room, it wasn\u2019t crowded; although in April Branson isn\u2019t crowded either. They had scrambled eggs, sausages, biscuits and gravy, toast, waffles, yogurt, donuts, cereal, and juice. I tried the eggs and the biscuits and gravy they weren\u2019t bad. The donuts were very fresh and really good. My only single issue with the hotel, which wasn\u2019t even a big deal was the lighting fixture next to my bed, it seemed to have a short in the wiring and caused it to sometimes flicker, it was such a small deal I only mentioned it to the front desk clerk as I checked out, and she told me that she would immediately put in a maintenance work order to have it fixed. The maintenance man just happened to be standing behind her laughed and said he would check it out. I have nothing bad to say about the Comfort Inn West hotel, I was very pleased in every way from the room, the service, and the grounds, the pool, even the location of the hotel. I really liked how everything from the letter I received before my arrival to the courtesy note from maid service was hand signed with a name... it really made you feel like you werent just a number. This is just one of the small personal touches that I think sets this hotel apart from so many others in a good way.

There were donuts, danishes, bagels, toasts, cereals, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, sausage and 2 kinds of waffles. The attendant was also checking to make sure there was plenty of food available and the food area was clean. One thing to note about this property is the building are all \"separate\". This is not all under \"one roof\". We stayed in what was the main part of the hotel, there were 3 floors and this part of the hotel had an elevator which was very convenient. The other 2 buildings which are only 2 stories did not appear to have elevator access. If there was an elevator I did not see it. The breakfast area is in it's own building.

I am not rating the value as we stayed for two nights on Choice Privileges points but I would guess the room rate should have been around $85-$90. I was familiar with this motel from location only having seen it in previous trips. It is a great location at the intersection of Highway 76 (the strip) and Shepard of the Hills Parkway (the red route). There are several entrances available so getting into and out of the parking lot is reasonably easy, even during busy times. The grounds are immaculate and obviously well maintained, lawns groomed, driveways clean etc. We arrived at about 5:00 on a Friday. Check in took a bit longer than I would have hoped. there were 3 staff at the front desk but 2 were on the phone and the third was helping with a ticket purchase. Other hotels in Branson have a separate ticket service area away from the front desk but here the staff was trying to handle both check in and show ticket purchases. One nice touch was the hotel sent us a welcome letter over a week before our arrival including a list of shows and prices. We had asked for a first floor room and one was awaiting us. That was really appreciated. Rooms are in three separate buildings and parking can get a bit tight but drive up parking by the room is great. We had a king room. It was clean and very serviceable but perhaps a bit on the small side. Since we were only in it a couple of hours a day it wasn't a problem but if you are going to be in it for any length of time I'd look for a bigger room or suite. Beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet for sleeping. I was a bit surprised that the TV was not a flat screen but one of the older convex screen style. Channel selection was good. The breakfast area was well stocked but always crowded. We did not check out the pool area but it is in a separate building in the center of the complex. The hotel is a 2010 Gold Standard winner in the Choice Hotel chain. Overall it is close to a gold standard but not quite. On a scale of 100 I'd rate the hotel at least a 90.

Hotel is conveniently located, at the intersections of several roads, in an area that gives easy access to many attractions. The pool and hot tub were nice. Hot tub was just the right temp. Majority of the breakfast, including biscuits and gravy was good, however, the scrambled eggs were nasty. Room was clean, quiet, and comfortable, although just a little bit small. It was nice to have a makeup mirror. Our only complaints are about small things, but they do add up. The air conditioner temp. and water temp. were both VERY touchy and difficult to adjust. The slightest turn of the dial made it too hot or too cold. It was impossible to attain the perfect temp. on either. We had a lot of trouble with our key cards not working. The clerk told us it was our fault for carrying them near credit cards or cell phones. Well, we stay in at least 25 different hotels a year and always carry our key cards in the same place, yet we only have this problem in every 50 to 75 hotels we stay at, so I hardly feel it was something that we did to cause the cards not to work. The maid never left us enough towels. We had to go to the office for more every day of our stay. We also ran out of toothpaste and asked for some at the front desk only to be told that they too had ran out. Now for a touchy subject that I feel I must say something about. Apparently, it is standard practice at this hotel to leave the Bible laying out open on the table with a scripture card on display. I do not feel that this was appropriate, as this is a hotel, not a church. I would not try to influence other people's beliefs and respect other people's choices. We do have freedom of religion in this country, and many people practice other religions. Some people may be offended by this display. Just having a Bible in the room should be sufficient enough.

At the same time there was a teenager convention at the hotel so the lobby was always loud and crowded, even for the size of the lobby it was sometimes tough to navigate your way out the front doors. Our room was a corner room so we had a perfect view of Fairbanks and Ohio streets and the lights at night gave an awesome view. However, the streets are very noisy at night so that woke us up a couple times, but it was worth the view! The hotel elevators are very slow, there are four elevators for 25 floors and you can only get about 8 people in an elevator at a time. We weren't disapointed with this hotel, it was within walking distance to Navy Pier and a long walk to Millenium Park and downtown. We did take the train to/from Midway airport, this cost about $2.25 per person each way which is much cheaper than the $40 each way a taxi would have cost....but beware....the train is not a comfortable way to travel and if you have kids and luggage I would recommend a cab. The train stations are dirty, smell like urine and have scary people lurking about, please dont take your kids down there! But this hotel is about 6 blocks from the Grand St train.

Usually that's something that doesn't need to be mentioned. However, for this part of Chicago, it does matter. Before booking, I read reviews on tripadvisor of most of the other nearby hotels in this price range, and many of them are full of complaints about street noise or nightclub noise. For example, a few blocks from this Doubletree there is a hotel in the same price class that is located directly above a fire station. I found no such complaints about noise at this hotel, so that's why I booked it, and I was glad that I did. This hotel is on a street that is quiet enough at night that I was not bothered at all. Despite being on a low floor (8 out of 23), street noise was not a problem, and there was no noisy nightclub. If you want a location that's in the thick of things, for shopping etc., stay closer to Michigan Ave, but if you want to sleep at night stay a few blocks closer to Lake Michigan, like this hotel. Other things to know: The rooms are big and still nearly new. Mattresses are good. Adjoining rooms with two queens are available -- that worked just right for my family. The front desk workers were eager to help; half of them were trainees when I arrived, but it worked fine. This is generally like other Doubletree hotels, except that the front entrance is a little obscure -- upon arrival we found ourselves walking around trying to find it -- it turns out that the main entrance for pedestrians looks a lot like the drive-through entrance to a parking garage. The poolside is not open in late March, if you want to sit outside on a warm day. The TV has a reasonably large number of channels. For example, it has ESPN and ESPN2 but not ESPNU. There are plenty of places for a family to eat nearby. Once our family stayed on the other side of the river in Chicago, at the fancy Fairmont (which we chose because it was close to museums) but there were hardly any places to eat around there. This is a much better location for a family that needs to find a place to eat. You have to walk several blocks to get to the MTA red-line. If you want a location closer to the red-line station, you'll probably get more street noise at night. It's about one block from a stop for bus number 151, which will take you to Lincoln Park.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe most nasty hotel stuff i ever been\u201d", "Author": "cacorro", "ReviewID": "UR126140979", "Content": "It was my first time in this doubletree hotel in Chicago, i've been in different doubletree hotels before and people were nice but since i checked in at this hotel in Chicago i have notice about that,front desk agents are not rude.... they are nasty....

Our room was clean and well-appointed, which was enough, considering that we only slept there. Staff seemed nice enough; the complimentary cookies on check-in were much appreciated! Not too much in the way of in-house facilities: no restaurant, and the attached bagel shop was never worth the bother or expense. Does appear to have a concierge desk, but I never used that service.

The staff are very helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the area around the hotel and Chicago in general. The magnificent mile shopping is only 5 minutes from the hotel, Navy Pier maybe 10 minutes, Hancock Tower 15 minutes, all of these a must for Chicago visitors. Malls I hadn't seen before,North Gate and The Water Tower (8 years since my last visit) were fantastically decorated for Christmas, although everywhere looked great. For the ladies the shopping is truly amazing, bargains everywhere so take comfy shoes guys. Going up the Hancock Tower just has to be done but pick a nice day, the views are worth it. Navy Pier is a Chicago landmark and although the shops are mainly souvenir outlets the indoor gardens and the outdoor ferris wheel and views mean you need to see it. The park at the front of Navy Pier has some nice sculptures as well. If you are a music fan (and I am a huge blues music fan) Chicago can accomodate you. Jazz or blues clubs and several piano bars are all over the place. House of Blues is a big venue but smaller clubs such as Blue Chicago, a particular favourite of ours, provide an intimate and close up view of the action. To see the blues played in this atmosphere is a great night out. OK that's the good stuff now the drawback. Apparently Illinois has some of the most severe alcohol taxes in the US so if you like a drink it isn't cheap. Last thing,the weather, Chicago isn't called the windy city for nothing and it was very cold, just about freezing every day. So if you are going for Christmas shopping, and it's well worth it, make sure you take gloves a hat and a scarf and duck into Starbucks regularly for coffee.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hicksville, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice Place, Good Staff\u201d", "Author": "fruityc", "ReviewID": "UR121890602", "Content": "Stayed in 2419 recently.

She had booked at the Chicago Doubletree Magnificent Mile because her daughter was taking part in a dance conference so I followed suit. The location of the DoubleTree Magnificent Mile hotel is excellent...it took us 5 minutes by taxi to get to Michigan Avenue, where all the shops are (10-15 minute walk) and mostly everywhere we wanted to go was a less than 10 minute taxi from the hotel. The cookies we received upon arrival were excellent! The lobby is very awkward and strange to hang around in. The parking rates of $43 a day are simply ridiculous but you do have in and out privileges which many places do not. Ben the parking manager is outstanding. Watch your phone rates! My companion was NOT told that each call made has a MINIMUM $20-$25 \"connection fee\" ON TOP of the crazy expensive phone rates so a couple of calls cost her over $150 dollars. I booked a \"lake view\" room which was nice but had many issues. First of all I paid $189 for a \"lake view\" room instead of $159 for a room with no lake view only to discover that the \"lake view\" is a peek of the lake through the surrounding buildings. I was surprised that there was no fan in the bathroom which is particularly annoying when you try to see yourself in the mirror after a steamy shower. The selection of toiletries was limited. There was also no safe, which always makes me nervous when leaving items in my room. There was an old sushi tray left in the mini bar that smelled awful and an old carafe and drinking glass that were filthy and left in the room. Room service was very good and timely -I had a chicken cobb salad which was delicious and the bread was very fresh and tasty. The trays that I left in the hallway (which I was asked to do) after I was done were not picked up for almost 24 hours. Watch the items on top of and inside the mini bar; once you pick them up, you are charged so make sure you check your bill upon checkout. I asked for a \"quiet\" room on a high floor (it was on the 23rd floor) but was put on a floor with several families with small (and noisy) children. There is no free in-room wifi but in the hotel public areas and lobby there is. When we asked the front desk for recommendations for breakfast, many things in the area were recommended except for \"West Egg\" which is right in front of the hotel and turned out to be the best we had.

There was also an ugly green sticky thing on my shower curtain. The sink was clogged. I called reception and complained about this stuff. the only thing they did was to fix the sink. Other than that, my bed had a worn out mattress. This is not a singular incident. One of my colleagues got a moldy room. The mold was so bad the the room really stank. As they were fully booked, he had to stay a night in that awful room until they transfered him to a different room.

The location is very convenient, and the bagel and coffee place in the lobby was perfect for breakfast. There's an inexpensive bakery / sandwich shop one block north which was very good. Now for the not-so-good. Every time I turned around I felt like this restaurant had their hands in my wallet. There's a snack bar alongside the coffee maker, with extremely overpriced snacks and a sensor, so if you even pick up the item, your room is charged. Really? So if I drop something while making coffee and it knocks the sensor I'll be charged $7 for a package of candy? Ridiculous. Internet is $9.95 per day for SLOW, or $19.95 for what I imagine is decent speed. Parking is $43 per night. Food from room service (in-house restaurant) was a mixed bag. Entree was just ok, but bread pudding dessert was fabulous. Noise from the street was pretty loud but I wouldn't put that all on the hotel. In short, what started as a $550 for 2 nights bill wound up being well over $700 when I factored in parking, internet, and room service for ONE dinner.

Not now. I arrived to be met by the surliest of staff who had obviously had a bad day. No smile, no welcome back, just a cookie offered from their undercounter ovens. I popped up to my room and was met with an almighty smell of damp and mould when I opened the door. So I turned around and headed back to the front desk. The same member of staff clocked me and I could tell she wanted to leave the desk, but I managed to grab her attention and explain the problem. She said that there weren't many king-size bedrooms left and that the one she had given me was the only one left. (The problem is that this property caters more for folks who want a twin bed room). I simply asked that she look again and find me another room, one that did not stink of mould. A good five minutes later I was on my way with a fresh keycard for a different king size room on another floor, but again I was faced with the same issue. Damp and mouldy smells. I started to think that I was the problem, but I asked a chambermaid on the floor to come to the room and smell it for herself. She agreed. So I called the front desk and insisted that I be given another room. Ten minutes then passed and a guy armed with yet another set of keycards came up and took me to another room. He had worked out how to avoid any further problems as the new room stank too, but this time of furniture polish and air freshener. Having now seen three rooms, I decided to give in and take the nicer-smelling room. Apart from the smells, the room afforded great views over the corner of Columbus and Ohio towards the Embassy Suites, Dominick's and the Sheraton over near the river and Wacker Drive. This proved to be a boon as I had a lot of natural light. The other two rooms were further along the corridors and looked out onto offices, making the rooms darker. The room itself had what you would expect: big TV, free Puck coffee, neutrogena toiletries in the bathroom and a comfy bed complete with Sweet Dreams cushion. I used the gym a few times, it's on the ground floor past the front desk and then on the left. It's a Precor one and has all the modern aparatus you'd expect. I also had dinner at the Market restaurant on the ground floor. The food and service were both excellent. I also ate there in the morning as that is where breakfast is served. The buffet is not the biggest but the quality of the food on offer was just fine. As for the location of the property, it's just a few blocks from Michigan Avenue if you are into shopping, and also a few blocks from Navy Pier if you want to hang out and have fun with friends and family. So it's pretty central. If you need to go into the Loop area, it's just a good 20 minute walk before you're at the Sears (now Willis) tower. You could cab it but I find Chicago effortless to walk around, plus it's good exercise. All in all, I usually enjoy my stays at Doubletree properties. They're no Ritz Carltons, but normally they do the trick. Alas, the issue with the damp and mouldy smells emanating from two of the rooms I saw will make me think long and hard about whether I return, plus the surliness from the front desk staff member did the hotel no favours.

I was here for a career fair and a series of job interviews and so I desperately needed to press my suits after my flights to look as polished as possible. The iron and ironing board provided in the room worked great for my purposes. Some downsides; one of the other candidates at the interviews also needed to press his shirt and the iron in his room didn't work. So he ran down to the front desk where they got him a replacement iron ASAP. But the thing that killed me was that the free wifi was only available in the lobby and everyone from this job fair had taken all of the available seating. I spent a sizable amount of money per night on this room and it hurt to have to spend additional $ just to get wifi in my room. Also, I needed to use the business center to reprint a cover letter that had been crinkled in my travels. The internet on the hotel computers worked at a glacial pace and they were charging you by the minute. All I needed to do was to open my Gmail and print this one page letter; it took me 15 minutes and $7 to do this. My reservation also included a free breakfast which was pretty decent; it was a buffet breakfast that had eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, etc. in addition to all of the continental breakfast usuals. I was definitely satisfied by this (especially since it was free!). This hotel is located near to the Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile shops, so you will have plenty to do.

The Magnificent Mile was just to the west, the Navy Pier to the east, Millennium Park to the south, and Northwestern University to the north -- all within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel itself seems to have been recently renovated as we had a room that was all updated and had a flat-screen TV (saw reviews earlier from about 4 or 5 months ago that said there was a tube TV in their room). I just wish we had more than two nights in the hotel and more time to just relax and enjoy the room, but since we only had three days in Chicago, we wanted to grab as much of the downtown core as we could. Service at the front desk was great and the staff was very friendly. We certainly would have no hesitation at all going back to the Doubletree again. However, there was one major incident that I think warrants mention - upon checking out, we were given the wrong bill/folio; we got somebody else's info including the person's home address, charge info, driver's license number, Hilton Honors, etc. I would be majorly ticked off if this had happened to me and my info was given to someone else (I sincerely hope this wasn't the case), and it caused problems when I wanted to present the bill to the border guards upon our re-entry back into Canada as proof of our stay in the U.S. I understand that accidents do happen, but something like this needs to be monitored more carefully to ensure that private information isn't given out to the wrong people. The check-out clerk was very friendly and remembered us from when we checked in, but he relied on his memory to pull up our info -- and he misremembered (thanks Roger Clemens for the use of that word) our room number by being off by one digit. What made it worse for me was that I sent an email to the hotel themselves, got no answer at all from them, then I emailed the Doubletree head office, it took them one week to finally answer me and that was a \"stock\" answer form saying to expect three business days for resolution of this issue. I am still awaiting resolution from them on this issue as I type this. All in all, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone else -- just be careful that the right information is being entered or given to you. Tip: There's a major grocery store a block away called Dominick's -- it's great for picking up a dessert or snack to bring back to your room, or even to get a breakfast fruit platter with a dip.

The only reason we chose this hotel was for the conference room rates. We had never been to Chicago before. First, the great: We booked an extra night beyond my conference dates and the hotel gave us the conference rate for the room. Our front desk service was exceptional with Pablo. It was not only easy but he was so pleasant and welcoming, it put me at ease. He got us into our room 15 minutes before check-in time. The support we received with checking our bags in the lobby and getting taxis was very good. The concierge helped us with choosing a great Italian restaurant. Another front desk employee (I think Alfredo?) helped us with restaurant choices, going so far as to call to find out about vegetarian options. We had a sink issue in our room, and it was dealt with immediately while we were out to dinner. The beds are super comfortable and the rooms with queen beds are spacious. We got free wireless through the conference rate. Awesome. (But it would have turned me off if I had to pay $10 per night for wireless in the room. This is an unnecessary fee to charge.) Next, the not so great: Booking the rooms was very difficult - I had to call at least 4-5 times to deal with pre-payment due to my conference reimbursement, and I received different information repeatedly from each person I talked to. This is exactly what turns me off from large hotel chains. The hotel has obviously worked to upgrade the rooms...to a point. We had a nice granite sink and large shower head and new tile. This is nice....except that all of the hooks for towels were either not in place (holes in walls) or falling off the wall (we used it anyway) which made functionality more difficult. I think we used more towels because of this. So, it is nice to have things look pretty but if it isn't functional, it doesn't matter how pretty the tile is....and the wallpaper and doors were peeling and chipping, so it really was a tile job and that is all. I'd rather have no tile but a well-maintained bathroom. Our tub drain was weirdly sticking out and we couldn't put it down. We had a leaky sink...if we let the water run for more than 10 seconds, the bottom of the vanity cabinet would start dripping water. The pool was impossible to use because of crowds of children running with noodles everywhere. I like kids....I really do....but one hour of adult swim at the end of the night would have been nice, especially with 100+ degree temps. Overall: It was a decent stay, but I would not choose it for the regular rates. I'd prefer a smaller hotel with better maintained bathrooms and a pool we can use. But I did feel we had good service.

We have never had any complaints until now. I traveled with my mother and sister. We were greeted by Candy at the front desk which was most of the reason for the bad experience. There was nothing hospitable about Candy. She seemed more suited for Popeyes or McDonalds. Summed up she was just plain \"ghetto\". After my mother and Candy went back and forth about the price she was quoted over the phone which did not include the tax, my mother paid for the first night and I gave Candy my credit card for the second night. Candy swiped my card and immediately told me it was denied. I was speechless and somewhat embarrassed. My mother jumped in and paid the rest on her debit card. The whole time going up to the room I was trying to understand why my card was denied. My cards have NEVER been denied. I had to go back down to the front desk to get this matter straightened out. I wanted to get my mother's money back on her debit card and put the charge on my card where it was supposed to be. I called my credit card company and the employee told me that my card was fine and he saw a previous charge from earlier that day which went through fine and I had a sufficient amount of credit available. He told me to have the front desk swipe my card for a $1 charge just to try again. Another front desk person swiped my card for $1and it was accepted. This employee brought it to Candy's attention and Candy pointed to the screen an said something like \"of course that went through\". I don't know if she was implying that the charge went through because it was only $1 or because it was a different card. Candy also gave me the last 4 digits of the card that was denied, which did not match my credit card( I had only one card in my purse). My mother and I went to the front desk and told Candy that we wanted the charges put on each card correctly and my mother's debit card credited ASAP back the money for the extra night. Of course Candy tried to tell us some BS about waiting 3 business days for the refund to get us to go away . Long story short, I knew that someone could hit a button and fix the mess that candy made. Candy went back to talk to a manager (or whoever was in the closed office) and came out with papers to make the corrections. We could have allowed Candy to sour our trip. We entertained the idea of leaving and staying somewhere else, but we were so excited about being in Chicago that we did not let that happen. Candy's tone was unpleasant. She treated us as if we were wrong when she made the mistakes. We did not feel like special guests. Candy did not treat us like people who were paying $200/night. Aside from Candy, the ice machine was broken on our floor and the female concierge did not seem like a real concierge. We had to ask her for everything. She did not offer assistance or knowledge. Seems like the cookies were fresher last time as well. I think we will consider another hotel next time. This hotel just isn't the same. I get a different vibe from some of the employees as well as if they aren't as happy as they were a few years back . I like what the hotel used to be. Maybe I just like the hotel without Candy there.

We arrived very late and check-in generally went smooth (there was a little confusion on the part of the desk clerk as to our room \"type\" on the reservation, but it was quickly resolved and, as noted above, was what we expected). Lobby isn't particularly large and is fairly simple, it did have free wi-fi. There were occasional elevator waits, but nothing too outrageous. It's worth noting there was some kind of H.S. band thing going on with lots of kids, chaperones, etc. that contributed to the delays, but the kids were generally well behaved. Also, we were disappointed to find they charge for use of the indoor pool (but did know about it from the hotel website), don't have the complete details of why and/or how this works as we didn't take \"advantage\" of it. I'm pretty sure they have a (seasonal) rooftop pool at no charge, but didn't check it out. Did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but did take advantage of the bagel place off the lobby for at least one breakfast and multiple coffees. Room was nice as expected and while my wife & I liked the mattress pillow my daughter didn't (at least she complained about it the first night). We *did* appreciate having an actual thermostat (with exact temps) rather then a \"hotter/colder\" dial, that leaves you guessing and can take some time to dial in to your comfort zone.

So first of all I need to preface that I stayed at the Doubletree because our booster club negotiated an $88 per night rate and that included the use of the pool which is normally $15 per room. Overall, my experience was what I would expect for paying $88 per night. Cons: 1. Rooms: I changed rooms three times which is not something I would normally do but the paint on the ceiling of the bathroom was peeling so badly that it was depressing. Also, there was rust on the tub (I don't live in mansion but when my bathroom at home is a LOT nicer than the hotel we have a problem) and the room furniture and walls were pretty beat up and no flat screen which seriously dates the hotel. We stayed on the 9th floor and it smelled like a mixture of cleaning products and smoke and carpeting was stained in hallways which overall doesn't make for a great atmosphere - but I guess what would you expect for $88. The paint on the ceilings in the bathrooms in the second and third rooms were a little bit better but overall rooms were really worn. I expected better from a Doubletree. I normally stay at Marriotts but have stayed in Doubletrees before where the rooms were a lot better. A taxi cab driver told us that the hotel used to be a Holiday Inn which would make sense, because the rooms and hallways reminded me of an old Holiday Inn which they tried to retrofit to a Doubletree. Linens were OK. 2. No free coffee in Lobby (you get it in the rooms but I am used to free coffee that is made in the lobby) and one of the electrical outfits in the main lobby looked like it had been melted and couldn't be used. Really only saw one useable electrical outlet in the lobby. 3. Pool was a hike to get to. 4. No free wifi - although I knew about this beforehand. Also, it looked like I would have been charged to use the business center and I can't tell you the last time I have stayed at a hotel that charged for internet usage or charged for business center services. Pros: 1. If you have a group that is cost conscious and needs a block of rooms for an event it looks like you can get a decent deal. 2. I will say that overwhelmingly the staff was VERY nice. The only bad experience was that the front desk person told me that I had to bring my own towels to the pool when in fact they have pool towels behind the desk. 3. Good location. 4. Eistein Bros. restaurant in building. Not sure that I would stay at this hotel again.

You have to show a carbon-copy of your parking payment to the attendant every time you leave so they don't charge you again.

I am so delighted that I did, as it provided a perfect location for a shopping trip with a friend. We were greeted so warmly at check-in by Jose. You would think we had booked a penthouse suite -- he treated us like 5-star guests and was very helpful. I can't remember another check-in where I was made to feel like such a truly valued guest, and it started our visit on a wonderful note. We went upstairs to a partial lakeview room that did not disappoint and was a good size for two, with very comfortable beds. In the rest of the hotel, the lobby was cozy with a cute little bar (and, conveniently, free internet access). And the Einstein's bagel shop in the lobby was super convenient to pop down for delicious bagels and coffee to bring back to the room for breakfast. Our positive experience extended to check-out and beyond, when we needed to leave bags due to a few hours lag time before our flight out. The bellman, whose name unfortunately I have forgotten, was very helpful and accommodating; we felt totally comfortable leaving our bags with him -- and, like our check-in, as though it was a pleasure to for him assist us. The only downside in the stay was having to pay for internet in the room -- and being presented with fees not by room but separately for each device -- a drag with two laptops and two iPods, which would have cost a fortune if we bought 4 separate internet plans. This really needs to be revisited to take into account the way people travel in 20111 (this is also the only reason I didn't give 5 stars).

But, were I to return to Chicago for either business or pleasure - or if I was panning a business conference - I would definitley look to stay elsewhere. There was no one big problem, but every little thing was a problem - and after a few days it just starts wearing on you. For example: 1. For our meeting we kept requesting a key to the meeting room and the hotel kept saying they would get us one - but never did. As a result after any break or lunch or when the day began, we had to wait (and wait...) for someone from the hotel to come with a key and open up the room. 2. On the first day of the meetings it took them an hour to find the training materials which had been shipped to the hotel the week before, and during that time they came back several times to say the materials must never had arrived. 3. The maid service failed to replace the room-service breakfast menu which you hang on your door knob at night to order the next day's breakfast. (No biggie) So i stopped at the front desk in the evening to ask for one and they did not have one and said someone would bring one right up to my room. (No biggie) After 30 minutes one had not arrived, and I was wanting to get ready for bed - so I returned to the front desk to ask again and even volunteered to go to some other section of the hotel get one if it would help. The desk clerk took on a very defensive attitude. I waited another 20 minutes at the desk for them to track one down. 4. The above referenced breakfast was delievred 10 minutes past the half-hour delivery window. 5. They day I checked out the maid knocked on my door at 8:00 to see if I had already left. I'll admit I did not have the do not disturb sign on the door - but on the day you check out housekeeping should be asking the front desk if you checked out, not the guests. 6. Leaving for th airport I asked the doorman for help with a cap. He tried to talk me in to waiting for \"the hotel's driver\" to come back and that he would only charge $45 to O'hare. Well, a) I had no interest in waiting around for a driver when a taxi wasright there, and b) the taxi with tip cost $49 - so there was no deal to be had with their driver.

The shower was very nice too and clean. The bed was comfy but the pillows kinda sucked because they were too heavy and dense. Our room had a window seat but it went to waste because we had a cruddy view of a parking garage across the street. My only real complaint about this hotel was that there was no fridge except for the bar fridge which was full of (very expensive, $4 USD for a can of coke) drinks. We had gone to Giordanno's for some Chicago deep dish pizza and took the leftovers back to the room, only to find out i didnt have a fridge to keep it in. Also the snack tray was horrendously expensive ($7 USD for a little bag of candy) and God forbid you touched anything because the sensors in the tray would automatically charge it to your credit card.

It will be very familiar to anyone who knows Doubletree hotels - a freshly baked cookie at check-in. The lobby is a little dated looking, but fairly large and usually busy. The lower level of the lobby has lounging areas, conference rooms and an overpriced business center. The rooms are large and very comfortable. They're modern and well-equipped, and the beds are uber-comfy. The bathrooms are also very large with plenty of counterspace, if a little plain. The shower pressure is fine, and there are Neutrogena bath products at your disposal. The snack tray in the room is touch-sensitive, so don't bump the dresser to hard or you might find an unexpected charge for pretzels on your bill. Thankfully, the coffeemakers are fronted by (very good) Wolfgang Puck coffees and actual liquid Coffee Mate, rather than that powdered crap. The TV set was an older model, although I'm told the hotel is in the process of updating to the flat-screen standard. The air conditioning was more than adequate - the room was frigid even though the temp outside was approaching 95 degrees. I didn't use the room service or visit in the in-house restaurant. There's an Einstein Bagels outlet just off the lobby. The location is a great one for visiting Chicago. It's a couple of (long) blocks from N. Michigan Avenue, and there are plenty of restaurants and stores in the blocks around the hotel, including a Dominick's grocery store and a multiplex movie theater. The proximity to Navy Pier also meant that there were a few too many screaming children in the hotel for my taste. Two CTA bus lines (66 Chicago and 157 Streeterville) stop right at the hotel's Fairbanks St. entrance. Several other bus lines run up and down Michigan, and the CTA red line Grand subway stop is about a four-block walk away. The Doubletree is a fine place to stay.

All the staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Concierge helped us navigate our way on bus routes, and helped my husband figure out a problem with his Stubhub tickets for the Cubs game. Getting around town from the Doubletree was easy, and we were Chicago newbies. The bus stop we used most often was 2 blocks away. We were close enough to walk the whole way to Navy Pier. We parked our van at InterPark, which is just across the street from Doubletree and significantly cheaper than the hotel lot. We could see our car from our hotel window. Very easy walk to Dominick's grocery store (bought our visitor bus passes there), 7-11, West Egg Cafe, Baskin Robins ice cream. Everything you need is nearby. The room was clean, had 2 queen size beds, and bathroom was fine. Room had ironing board and hair dryer. We were advised at check-in to move the snack tray (with computer sensors on it) up high so our kids wouldn't fool with it, causing charges to the room. When my husband tried to move the tray up high, all the snacks fell off and we were worried we would be charged for everything! The front desk clerk was understanding, and said it was no problem. This must happen often... The rooftop pool was nice, had plenty of chairs and towels, and was the perfect relaxation spot after our long days of sightseeing. Kids thought it was cool to swim on the rooftop surrounded by all the buildings of Chicago. An unexpected bonus: We could see the Wednesday night Navy Pier fireworks from the rooftop pool area. We did not want to pay $25 extra to have a refrigerator in the room, so we brought our own cooler with drinks, some kid snacks, and a gallon of milk. This way, we could eat a quick breakfast in the room (single-serve cereal bowls and some fruit) before heading out for our activities. Saved money and more convenient, and we just refilled the cooler with the hotel ice machine when needed. This hotel was perfect for our needs, the location was great, staff were friendly, and the price was right. We did not have trouble with elevators.

The location can't be beat if you're looking to be near the magnificent mile or Navy Pier. We were traveling in a group with family and young kids, and got a great price on our two rooms, although parking fees are very pricey (as is typical in a big city) which kind of cancels out that good feeling. :) The hotel lobby is very trendy and nice looking, and everyone at the front desk and concierge desks were very friendly. Our kids had a blast swimming in the fifth floor rooftop pool... and sitting on the window seat overlooking the city and all the action happening twenty floors below! Overall, we had a good experience. There were some quirks that are worth mentioning/knowing, which prevented me from giving this hotel a higher rating. First, the hotel does not pre-block rooms, so when we checked in, even though both rooms were reserved under the same name and credit card, we were not able to get rooms next to one another or even on the same floor without giving up our \"view\" of the lake and settling for one handicapped room next to the elevator and ice machine. Kind of a bummer considering it was a special birthday trip. Second, the elevators are very busy and it takes a while to catch one... so we felt the higher up you are staying in the hotel, the better. I felt really bad for the people on the lower floors who were trying to make it to the Lobby. People on floors five, six, and seven almost always had to wait for another car because the elevator was already full. Third, housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:45 AM to see if we \"needed anything.\" It just so happened that we were traveling with children and were awake... and housekeeping had not left any coffee packets in the room (the other room we rented had no coffee maker at all) so we took them up on it, but if we had been on a trip where I'd wanted to sleep in, I'd have been pretty upset. I double checked with the housekeeper to make sure she hadn't mistaken our room for some other room that had actually called them, and she said \"no.\" I've worked in a hotel before, and honestly, my impression was that she was just fishing for extra tips.

I will start with my review of the good. This hotel is in a good location for downtown Chicago. You can walk to many areas of the city. The Navy Pier is 4 blocks the Mag mile is in four blocks. There are many resturants in this area too. Now for the bad of this hotel. This hotel is owned by Hilton Inc. ,whch is known for there service the and atmosphere . Will at this hotel it doesn't do that both time we were there. First with you stay there in your own car you have to pay $40 a day we were there for 4 days that is $160. I think that if you are stay in the hotel it should be free or maybe $10. If you are not stay have those people pay the $40. Next is if you are a honors member and you have to check in early they will put you in a non member part of the hotel which is the lower half of the hotel where noise street noise is and the rooms are not as nice or as clean. Next thing is if you want a sit down fill breakfast. There is a resturant that is in the hotel it is nice but if you eat there for breakfast you are looking at $20 a person. So that is $80 for four, for staying in your hotel. That should be free or maybe $5 to $10. If you need a sit down breakfast go across the street to Two Eggs,t is alright for $30 for four. Or go to Domonick grocery store down a block. A full grocery store that as everyting. Next complaint is the hotel as no free internet in room just in the lobby so if you are on the 25 floor and need its several times a day happy traveling on the elevator. They have a business center in the hotel but to use the internet or the printer it is $9 for 15 mins. I think that is highway robbery for someone staying in there hotel. It should be free and to print 25 cents a page. So bring you own printer so you can print game tickets and documents I did. Complaint #4 is the Hotel bar, The bar is only open from 11:30am to 7:30pm. How many business and vacationer drink beer, wine or scotch at 11:30 in the morning, and who closes a bar at 7:30pm and in Chicago This is the stupidiest think i have every seen in a bar. I want down to the bar to have some drink with my wife. while the kids were in the room watching TV. We got there at 7:15pm and the bartender said that he as closed the bar for the evening because business is slow and told us to go across the street to Timmy O'toole. Also while I was using the internet in the lobby I watch him turn people away about 25 people in one hour because he was closing the bar and would not open it again. That is some really good 4Star service for you isn't it and lose of money for the hotel. Here is my tip go to Domonicks grocery a block down get your beer & wine. Bring it back to the hotel and drink it in your room or in the lobby while using the internet. But stay in the hotel because of drinking laws. This is a cheaper way of having fun in the lobby and on the internet in the evening. I did it all four nights. Complaint #5 is for this hotel to read. You are Doubletree Hotel in the 80's and 90's you were known for you 4 star service and atmosphere. Get off your money hungry attitude and give your members the service and style that they should get. This hotel did not give anything for free nor did they care. Before I left my Hilton Garden Hotel in the Suburb that was a $110 a night and got free in room internet/ breakfast/coffee and the bar was open until 11. So Doubletree get off your high horse and clean up your act I will never stay in a Doubletree again and I have stay in many. So for the people that have read the whole review you make the judgement of staying in this hotel or not.

The hotel is pretty much full-service, and is close to pretty much everything in Chicago. We stayed on the 23rd floor and had a great view from our room. The bed and bedding was extremely comfortable and it was difficult to get out of bed. The bathroom was spacious and clean, and the shower's water pressure was good although it never got quite hot enough for my taste. We had appetizers and drinks in the Market House restaurant, which seems to be a nice place, if a little pricey. The mini-burgers were pretty good. There is also a gift shop in the hotel with souvenirs, toiletries, snacks, etc. It was very, very expensive but may come in handy occasionally. Previous reviews about ultra-slow elevators are accurate. Also, the gripes about paying for internet service are legitimate, also. We, too, avoided the $ 6 Pringles and the $ 8 bottled water, but it's available if that's your thing. Ben, the bellman, was very helpful during our checkout. Our flight did not leave until 7:00 p.m. so after we checked out, the hotel held our luggage for a few more hours so we could continue exploring Chicago.

The odor came from the pillows in the beds. It seems that housekeeping hadn't changed or washed the pillows from the previous guest stay. I called the Front Desk and told them about the situation and they offered to assign me another type of room in a lower floor. Well, i acepted. They other room was clean but still had some odors but i decided no to bother anymore.

We usually stay at one of the Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago, but didn't have enough points for a free night there. Getting off the elevator from the parking garage, you are greeted by a pink lobby. My husband gave me the look that said he was doubting my decision. At check-in, they asked us if we wanted to stay in one room one night and then a different room the next night, since one of them was free for using my HHonors points. We said that we'd rather not have to change rooms and he said, \"okay\"! He gave us our cookies and our keys and sent us on our way. We were given a room on the 3rd floor, that look out at a wall. No view! My guess, is this is what is given to people who stay at enough Hilton Hotels to earn a free room. We weren't going to be in the room very much and it was a free night's stay, worth approx. $206, so we just went with it. The room was mostly clean, except for hair on the bathroom floor and on the first night, a panel fell off the cabinet on bathroom vanity. We tried to put it back on, but it wouldn't go, so we left it for the cleaning person to deal with. They didn't deal with it, so we had a cabinet door on the floor in the bathroom for our stay. The location of this hotel is great. There is a Dominick's grocery store just a block away and Emilio's Tapas restaurant is just down Ohio about a half a block. It's a wonderful place to eat! Only 2 blocks from Michigan Ave, where all the shopping is. We got a bill after the first night, that said we had been charged $206 for our night's stay. Fine. The following morning, I received a bill stating that they were going to charge us $20 for the guest room. We also had a charge for a video game, but my daughter did play a game, so that was fine. I talked to the person at the desk and I got no explanation for it, but she took it off my bill. So check you bill very closely!!!! This wasn't a bad place to stay, but there were just many things about it, that just made it not a great place to stay either. We had just come from staying at a very nice Embassy Suites in another city and this seemed like a very big step down. In large cities, I usually pick 4 star hotels, because we think they would be considered 3 star anywhere else. This hotel was definitely a 2 1/2 - 3 star. The cost of parking for the weekend, was around $80, I believe. I guess I learned, getting a free room, is never free. My husband said he'd rather pay more and stay at an Embassy Suites with breakfast included and the manager's special in the evening. Also, pink with lime green made it look like a cheesy hotel from the 60's or 70's. If they just renovated, they should of changed that.

I have only had pleasant experiences with Hilton before so I was unprepared for the drasticly different experience I had at this one.

I requested another room and when I moved into that one there were no bugs or tissues but there was pubic hair and other dirt on top of the toilet, something sticky on the bathroom wall and not all of the toiletries were present. When we requested housekeeping the next day we had to ask 3 times between 12pm and 6pm before anyone came to the room. We had the exact same experience the second day of calling 3 times in 2 hour increments before anyone would service the room and at this point we were out of both toilet paper and tissues because they had not been replenished the day before. I tried to use the business center and the printer was malfunctioning. When I called the front desk for help instead of sending someone down they transferred me to the company that manufactures the printers where I listened to hold music for ten minutes and finally gave up. Finally, on the third morning of our stay the bill was slipped under our door and we were charged for 3 nights of parking when we didn't have a vehicle with us so my departure was delayed as I had to wait in the checkin/checkout line to resolve this before I could leave.

PROS: Nice bedding spacious and clean room counter space in bathroom hair dryer single cup coffee maker (much more sanitary than the carafe style!) Three blocks from Michigan Ave walkable to Navy Pier One block from Dominick's (a nice grocery store with a deli and bakery) Ample drawer space Friendly staff (Pablo comes to mind!) When we entered the room the lamps were already on! They must activate the lamps from the front desk after the room is assigned. A very nice touch. THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES EVER (one free per preson at check-in) Free internet in the lobby, about $10 a day in the room ONE CON: When we walked in I noticed a bunch of jars sitting next to the TV. That part of the room was sort of dark, even with the lights on. I didn't notice the card placed near the jars and I picked up a jar to see what it was. My husband told me to put the jar down because if it is picked up - it is purchased. You really can't see what is in each jar while they are sitting on the tray. (photo included.) The jars held grossly expensive gummy bears, nuts, candy, etc. I think that this tray of jars needs better and bigger signage, needs to be placed in a better lit part of the room and needs to be placed higher than a child can reach. You walk into that room with two youngsters and you might be buying $50 worth of gummies and pretzels! ONE SUGGESTION: Since it appears that management reads these reviews (which is another 'PRO'), why not stock the mini-bar and those dang snack jars with affordable food/drink from which you make a modest profit? Many more people would buy a $1.50 Snickers from the mini-bar than a $4 one - and you still make money.

I knew that there were going to be 4 guys in 1 hotel room, so some extra towels and pillows would be great. These items were NOT in the room, even though I specifically requested them months prior when making the reservation. What gives? -3 bath towels in a room that is meant to hold up to 4 guests.

Why is this information not on the website? -Housekeeper tried to enter our room on Sunday morning without announcing herself when we had a Do Not Disturb sign up. Thankfully the room was locked, but still...come on now. -After returning late from a bar one night, we got in the elevator and had a security guard come in after us. He did not say a word to us, but just followed us to our room and then left. SO CREEPY. I am really not okay with this...made me feel like I was a criminal or something. -Location is very good...just maybe 2 blocks from Mag Mile and a few more to other good areas like State Street and the Red Line CTA. We could also walk to Vision/Excalibur where our event was at. -The hotel has been renovated and brought up to date with contemporary furniture, but you can still tell it was once a Holiday Inn back in the 80s just by the architecture and layout. The remodel really did do a good job though and it's on par with other Doubletree hotels, although they did not replace the TVs. Rooms really could benefit from some flat-panel TVs.

We got to the floor we were on, and again, nicely appointed, with a couch for waiting. Our room was a King lakeview. The room, including the bathoom was a very nice size, and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The location was terrific as well, a few blocks from Michigan Ave and all that entails. I should note here that Lakeview is a bit of a misnomer. They aren't lying that you are facing the lake, the only issue that there are some pretty tall buildings between their location and the lake, and so your views of the lake consist of sides or between buildings. Not a big deal for us, but if you're the type who wants to see every sailboat and swimmer, you may be disappointed. The service was very good. Excellent, even. The one front desk agent was a little abrupt in informing us the gift shop was closed when we were checking out early, but otherwise the staff were excellent. Ben out front had a cab within seconds, and the concierge(want to say Dan, but I can't remember exactly) was able to arrange our large group(only a few who were staying at the hotel) some tables at a busy restaurant. We called for some sugar for coffee, and within 4 minutes someone was there with the sugar, and 20 minutes later there was a phone call making sure we got the sugar. The towels were a little inconsistent, but they were brought right away when we asked. Excellent service. The one big negative had to do with the TVs. Not so much that they weren't flat screens, although you might expect them in a hotel that was so recently renovated, but the volume that the hotel channel is at when you first turn it on. It didn't seem to matter what the level was when you last turned it off, the volume was such that most of an army barracks would be awakened in an instant. You have no control over that volume when you turn it on. It's a race to get it down ot a manageable level. The other thing was that ther was no information booklet, it was a laminated card that was folded 3-4 ways. This is minor, no question, just was difficult to figure out that was where you got the info. I kept meaning to check it out, but never got the chance, but apparently hotel guests have access to the Lakeshore Athletic club next door. This would definitely be a big plus if this is still the case. A very good hotel though.

We found the hotel to be quite convenient to most of the things we needed or wanted to do. The room was really nice, as we had booked a double queen room with a Lake View. The beds were really soft and comfortable, and the air conditioning was terrific. Bathroom was clean, and the housekeeping gladly gave us extra towels as we were travelling with our two children. Only complaint with the room was the lack of a fridge. A minor compIaint, but just wanted to mention it here. I would think that with the cost of staying here that a fridge would be included. There is a mini-bar fridge in the room, however that is full of the mini bar itself....with no room for your items. Keep in mind if you are travelling with children that the table top mini-bar has sensors that if an item is moved you will be charged for it. i.e. jar of peanuts, etc. This was not an issue for us as our kids stayed away from it, just wanted to leave that advice to anyone else. Other hotel ammenities included a rooftop pool (obviusly closed in October, but it was there just the same), and free Wolfgang Puck Coffee and Teas in the room which was nice. As well as Neutrogena shower products. Attractions: The hotel is within walking distance to Navy Pier, the Hancock Building (as a matter of fact, our room had a view of the Hancock Building which at night was spectacular!) and of course the 'Mile itself. Restaraunts: The hotel has its own restaraunt, Marketplace, along with an Einsteins Bagle shop, however we did not dine at either of these places, instead dining away from the hotel at easy to walk to locations like the West Egg for breakfast...across the street... (Awesome!), Gino's East Pizza (two short blocks away), or the Corner Bakery (located also real close to the hotel in the Northwest Medical building.) Convenience items: There is a Dominicks store across the street from the hotel that has everything you may need during your stay. The hotel is across the street from Northwest Medical, so you may hear ambulances coming and going at night, but hey, this is Chicago, if you wanted deep silence you wouldnt be booking a trip to the city. Taxis also are lingering around the front entrance to the hotel, so you will always have convenient transportation. The concierge was also wonderful, and always had good advice to local shops, restaraunts, etc. He also was able to get us transport to Ohare the morning we left, in a nice SUV (Infiniti) that cost us no more than a regular city taxi to the Airport would have cost, which was terrific. All in all, I would definately stay here again, this is a well run hotel, convenient to everything worth seeing, and family friendly....oh yeah, free warm chocolate chip cookies for you at check in...which as you can imagine was a big hit with the kids!", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio", "Title": "\u201cThis was a great location and a nice clean hotel.\u201d", "Author": "funtripbf", "ReviewID": "UR46253547", "Content": "The staff was friendly and helpful and I really enjoyed the decorum of the rooms.

Still, my six-year-old daughter and I decided to take an impromptu trip to Chicago and wanted to stay at a different hotel. We picked Doubletree because of the location and based on some of the reviews. We arrived at O'Hare and decided to take the subway in order to get a true feel of the city. The subway ride was entirely long and the train stop (Grand - Red Line) was quite a distance from the hotel. When we arrived, the lobby looked rather contemporary and new. The front desk staff were reasonably hospitable. My disappointment is with the room itself and the amount of noise you can hear in the hotel. Every morning and evening we would hear the other guests coming and going through our room door. It was so loud that one night my daughter and I jumped thinking someone was trying to get into our room. Then one guest must have been checking out at 5:30 in the morning so we were unfortunately awakened then as well. I so wanted to get some rest on my vacation since the whole purpose was to releax and have fun. We simply weren't able to do so at this hotel. We could also hear through the relatively thin walls. The noise reason alone will be the reason I will never return to this hotel. The beds were indeed comfy and as one reviewer already noted, the pillows weren't so great. There was a lot of settled dust around the nightstand (on the clock, the lamps, etc). The problem with that is it indicates the areas were not cleaned prior to our use. The bathrooms were just okay. We stayed in room 2507 and the cabinets in the bathroom were damaged and the door had visible dirt. The shower curtains were extremely fresh and had just been laundered. The towels were clean and so was the sink, toilet and tub. The shower head had an extremely soft flow and there was definite temperature restrictions on how hot you could make the water. I do feel we would have better enjoyed our trip at the Hilton Homewoood Suites. Not only was it much closer to the Magnificent Mile, it was much closer to the Subway. Also, I'm sure it was quieter since I didn't see guests complaining otherwise. I will also say that the Concierge (with the exception of a lady that was working Saturday, Sept. 19 in the evening) and the staff in the restaurant were extremely friendly.

The carpet down our hall was dirty. Near the elevators on the 6th floor there was a heating unit or something that had pulled away from the wall and you could see the area that was not wallpapered. The hinges on the doors were painted over instead of being removed during the painting process. Also for a hotel that was just remodeled last year I don't understand why they have old TVs in the rooms. Where are the flatscreens? Our rooms were large and clean. I liked the beds, but my sister thought they were too hard. Be aware, when checking in, this hotel will freeze up $50/day on your credit card for incidentals. That I don't like and I have never had that happen at a Marriott, Crowne Plaza or Grand Hyatt. If I hadn't asked, I would not have known and the only reason I asked is because I had that happen at a Hilton Garden Inn in another city.

We had warm cookies waiting for us. The concierge was helpful and friendly. The bellhop was professional and friendly. The restaurant staff was friendly, as was housekeeping.

Beds were comfortable. The bath towels were cozy. The furniture and accessories were high quality. Now for the negatives for me. Please keep in mind that others may not mind this. We traveled as a family of four. The first thing I noticed was there was no counter space in the bathroom. The sink was a pedastal sink. It seemed like we had a handicap accessible room so maybe that is why. There just wasn't any where to put our \"stuff\". The room seemed small, although for Chicago standards, it was probably fine. Not a lot of room to move about. There was a $15 per person per day charge for the first day for use of the health club where the pool was, and a $5 per person per day charge for every day thereafter. There was a $9.95 per day charge for internet. Self parking is $41 per day. It just seemed like they nickled and dimed. There was a mini bar and a minibar fridge, but don't touch anything! It has sensors on it. If you pick something up and it is off the sensor for more than 30 seconds, your room gets automatically charged for the item, even if you don't open it. They will take the charge off, but that isn't the point to me. There were no channels for children on the TV. When we were winding down at night around 10 p.m., I turned on the TV. The cartoon channel had adult cartoons on it. No big deal there, but when I was flipping through, an explicit adult channel came on. Ooops. So I found the parental controls on the TV. There were no other kids channels on. So we watched Travel Channel, which was okay by me!! Our room was against the elevator shaft, so we heard the noise from that all night. In addition, there were at least 2 rooms that had partiers in them. However, the management came up when someone must have complained and they toned it right down. The staff and management is really on top of most everything in this hotel. I think for a business traveler or a couple on a get away weekend, this hotel would be very nice.

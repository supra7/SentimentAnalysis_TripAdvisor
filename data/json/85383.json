It's beautiful and well maintained. It has two large pools and A few kiddie pools as well. There are a few hot tubs around the pool area as well. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. The rooms are always clean. The units are spacious. ( ours is a large two bedroom, two bath, with kitchen, living room and laundry room). The master has a very large hot tub and shower. The second bedroom has a queen bed and a pull out. The living room also has a pull out. The unit sleeps 8 people. I think there are some smaller units as well. Each unit has a large screened balcony. It has a table and 4 chairs for dining or playing games or just relaxing in the morning with your coffee. It's a peaceful escape that I look forward to going to as much as possible. You do not feel like you are in Orlando, when you are here. It's not crazy busy like a Disney hotel. It's family orientated, but in a more laid back area. I have never visited during the summer or spring break, so I never had a problem getting a chair by the pool or a parking spot, but I'm sure those are concerns at peak time. This is a timeshare property, but available to rent as a hotel. It's one of the older \" vacation club\" properties, but perfectly maintained, and always spectacular, in my opinion. It is conveniently located between Disney and Universal. It is very close to Seaworld and the Outlets. You need a car if you stay here, there is nothing within walking distance . I do wish this property had a real restaurant. It does have a pool bar and a snack shop that sells food and supplies. The pool area has a pizza hut/ food window that sells chicken fingers, pasta, salads & sandwiches. Nothing fancy, and nothing wonderful. I usually stock the refrigerator with breakfast and lunch supplies and go somewhere else for dinner. Some units overlook the golf course or pond. They are quiet and serene and quite breathtaking. The units overlooking the pool are very noisy. There are units far away from the pool ( by the kisa club area) that have another smaller pool, that are just perfect for families with little ones. Very easy to walk back and forth all day. There are also free paddle boat rentals.

Let me start by saying there are several pluses with Cypress Harbour. One of them being that all the staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. We were treated graciously at every turn. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. You don't need to fight to get a chair by the pool. It is busy but not overly crowded. We had a problem with our washer one evening, by late the next morning, we had a new washer in our unit. My daughter had a problem with her manicure at the spa, they promptly arranged for her to have it redone...with a smile. So in terms of service..top notch from the front desk to the spa. We stayed in a renovated Villa and herein lies the problem. Our villa was very clean, yet still smelled of mildew on occasion although we couldn't pinpoint the cause or the source. We had a king size bed, but the pillows were standard....even with 2 pillows, they felt too small for the bed. When they renovated the villa, instead of replacing the nicked, somewhat broken baseboards....they chose to heavily paint over them. They updated the bathroom but kept some of the cheaper fixtures .I realize I am being picky, but the high quality standards I expect from Marriott were not there and will be noticeable too, to people who have stayed at other, nicer MVC's, There are fun activities to do around the resort but my kids are young adults, so most weren't for them. The resort is very big, so if you have small children you may want to request being close to the pool or activity center or you may have to walk quite a ways or drive depending on which pool you want to go to. You can also request to be near the golf course or other areas that are more quiet if you wish it to be less on the hectic side of things. The spa is lovely and there is also has a nice work out facility. We did not use the golf course, but it looks well maintained and was always busy. Lastly, there is a least one alligator in the lake that likes to hang out near or on the golf course across from the nature deck trail. Probably not dangerous, but I would watch my kids by the waters edge none the less in case he likes to travel to other parts of the lake, and I wouldn't dangle my hand in the water if you rent the paddle boats!

Instead, it has one bed and a pullout sofa. The room was extremely tight when the bed was pulled out. The kids activities were not on par with those we have become accustomed to at Harbour Lake, and there seemed to be less for the kids to do.

Even though we did not have to use it, I hate having to ask for one so that was a nice touch. 3 )They had a broom in the closet if you needed to tidy up and the laundry room was huge! 4) The luau was excellent. Sitting by the pool with your feet in the water and watching the show was ideal. 5) Most importantly, I left my purse in the safe. They mailed it back to me, and sent me a check for the cash in it. I have stayed at several hotels and they always say they never found something I left. This place is great and more than accomodating. 6) The swim towels are in your room, not at the pool. We went down to the hot tub and it started to poor. Our towels were soaked. The bartender went to the front desk and brought us new ones. We did not have a chance to use the amenities or even see the property as we went to Sea World each day, but you can bet that we will be back here next year. Never before have I seen such excellent service by everyone I met there. We have stayed at Marriott Sabal Palms, Grand Vista, Harbour here in Orlando and I say hands down this is the best. My husband likes Sabal Palms more because it had a bigger living room. I rated this place higher because the step in sabal palms was a worry.

We only used the pool one day and it was fine. We also rented the 4-person bike, but we were limited as to where we could ride it. You were pretty much limited to the parking lot area which was disappointing. I believe it was $14 rental fee for half an hour of use, but I may be wrong. The location was convenient to Disney, and since that it what we were down there for, we did not take advantage of any of the scheduled activities at the resort. Parking was very convenient and we never had a problem finding a close-by spot, even when we returned home late at night. We ordered from the on site Pizza Hut and it was delivered fast and hot.

Ask for one of the renovated units...they have some in most of the older buildings, in the 50s and 60s. Look at a map of the property...some of the buildings are really far, a healthy walk or drive, and might be an issue if you are schlepping stuff and kids to the pool. There are three pools...heated, but I think they should be a little warmer especially on some of the cooler December days. The main pool has jets in one section...and that is kind of cool. The renovated units have decent finishes, color coordinated paints, linens, try ceilings, ss appliances, granite counters...but I'm really not looking for decor as my best feature in a one week timeshare exchange. I liked that the master suite had an air tub rather than a jacuzzi which is much more hygienic. The second bedroom has a queen bed and then a sleeper sofa...very crowded and awkward arrangement. The units are narrower and smaller overall than Marriott's Harbour Lake across the street. I liked that there were 2 small hot tubs at each pool, so that if one was out of order or not working, you could use an alternate. Some other reviewers have said that this is the largest timeshare they've stayed at inOrlando...I would disagree and say that there are several other properties with larger units. The unit was tidy but not perfectly clean; the carpet was new but needed a cleaning and the master shower had some mold that bleach would have taken care of easily. The grounds are beautiful and there are a number of activities at the activity center, e.g. Crafts, races, etc...if this is your thing. If you have kids, definitely stay at Harbour Lake. We needed some business services that any regular hotel with business travellers would have accomodated, but they dropped the ball for us...i am not really surprised or disappointed because this is a timeshare resort, but it was a little frustrating that day. We arrived 2 hours before check in at 1pm, and they were able to accomodate us early...very unexpected. This was a nice property, but I wasn't blown away by the resort.

It was rarely crowded and the water was nice. We made a daily trip to the pool. The resort team dressed in elf costume delivered stockings for the kids. The stockings were not free, but it was a nice touch to have that Christmas spirit being away from home. My daughter kept saying, \"I knew Santa would find us!\" There were also many activities around the resort and lots of playgrounds for the kids to use. The resort was courteous about getting our supplies replenished upon request. Cleaning was not included with our stay. But they gave us plenty of cleaning supplies within the villa. We also enjoyed the full size washer and dryer. The Marriott Grande Vista had the two-in-one units in their villas. The only downside was that our villa (Building 72) was far away from the main attractions of the resort. With a toddler, we had to drive to the pool. But that didn't ruin our trip whatsoever.

Many planned activities to choose from...including s'more making with excellent live music, luau night, etc. Grounds are immaculate, pride of ownership is apparent from all staff. Had pizza hut at main pool one night and it was very good. The market place had all grocery items you might need. The guy who ran the pontoon boat was extremely friendly, making a fun experience excellent for the children. We did the Vacation Club viewing and were offered an excellent deal on Universal tickets which I highly recommend. The park tickets allowed for an hour early entry to Harry Potter, well worth taking the tour. (With our early entry, we were able to ride Forbidden Journey twice....if we had come later in day would have been a 50 minute wait!) The location of this resort is great, direct route to I-4. There's a reason why this beats out the other Marriott Vacation properties in Orlando...its very family friendly, beatuiful and staff aim to please.

They had about 3 0r 4 pool areas in this complex, I could not believe the size of the complex it was massive, all the staff ride around on golf buggies it is so big!! The surroundings are so pretty and very clean too. We had a great 2 bedroom apartment looking on to the lake not far from the spa, the view was lovely!! There is so much to do here a lot more than the other 5 places I have stayed in Florida. They have day activites, some night time entertainment, Boat Hire, Golf Range, Bike Hire, Kids club. For me this is one of the best places to be situated, you could walk to sea world or even get on the I trolley outside the complex for $1.25!!! Universal was not far either, you could catch the I trolley for just $1.25!!! Not too sure how long that would take maybe about 40 - 60 mins. Disney was not far, you could also jump on Lynx bus (At the end of the drive by the Chemist/Shop) No 50 to Down Town Disney ($16.00 in Taxi) or Magic Kingdom it only took me about 15 minutes at the cost of $2.00 !!! I will mention to you that you should buy your park tickets before you go as you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever get good deals in Florida like we do in England. If you pay per day Disney Parks are around \u00c2\u00a357 + Tax and on top of that parking is about $15.00 (Wow now we know how they make their money) From Cypress Harbour you could catch the I trolley to the Premium outlet. This is like 10 minutes ride. There is another premium outlet not far from universal which is a bit bigger than the other outlet. I spent an Hour on a Lynx bus to get to Florida Mall!! For me this was a total let down and would not go there again, I wish I had gone to Mall at Millennia as it looks great. If you fancy a night out with music and entertainment go to Disney Board walk - Jellie Roles with Duelling pianos - check the website out it is $10.00 to get in (about $28.00 there in taxi from Complex) Universal City walk (Blue Martini) is meant to be a good night out but did not get the chance to enjoy that.

What can you say about this resort!. First and foremost it is excellent for families. As anyone who reads some of my reviews will know, I spend a significant proportion of my year in hotels and have a high bar, in terms of quality. This definitely meets that. As a hotel, for a vacation, is not always holiday! I like to get away and relax and not have to think about the little things that will niggle, in terms of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This Marriot resort delivers on both levels. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d booked this trip as a special 2 week vacation for my family (my wife and young son). Upon arrival the check-in staff were very courteous. After a long-haul flight, that was very welcome. They showed me the apartment I would be staying in on a map, in relation to the entire resort. As I had a young son with me, it was not close to either of the 2 pools, so I asked to move closer to a pool and they accommodated the request, without hesitation. On that point, the resort does have 2 pools. The main pool at the resort entrance and a smaller satellite pool off to the left of the lake, by the kids club. This is a quieter pool, without pool bar. But for those of you who do not favour so much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noise and activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is a better place to be. However, the main pool is better for the older kids. We stayed in a 2 bed apartment. It was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The kitchen area had a double sink, dishwasher, oven & microwave. There was a separate washing room with washing machine and tumble dryer with ironing board and iron. The dining room was significant, leading into the lounge area with a modern TV with cable TV and a very large L-shaped sofa and chairs to seat all the family very comfortably. Each bedroom has king sized beds (very comfortable matrasses) with plenty of wardrobe space and the master bedroom had and double sink, shower and hot tub. Even better was the hot-tub was positioned next to the bed so you could actually watch TV in the TUB \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice touch! Outside was a screened veranda with fan which overlooked the golf course, which was well used of an evening\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. The on-site store was adequate but priced at a premium, as you might expect. But it catered for all the basics you need to get you started or for the snacks, should you not want to go off site. In addition there was an onsite Pizza Hut which was of a very good quality. Evening entertainment was also provided both in the clubhouse and by the pool bar. There was also a Kids Club which was a very good standard and ran during the day and some evenings until 9:30p.m. It was well supervised and the smaller children were very well looked after. This was an excellent service, again well used for a rest bite!

The facilities on site were generally of a very high standard and the staff service was of the best I have seen and I have travelled the world, on business for the past 20 year staying in hotels. This resort REALLY DELIVERS! We did have a couple of very minor issues during our stay and we called resort maintenance. Each time, within 15 minutes, a very polite maintenance man arrived at the door and sorted the problem, followed by a call to check everything had been resolved to our satisfaction. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really ask for more than that, if you have a problem (apart from the problem not being there in the first place, of course, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) the service was very good in solving it. Finally, the location of the resort is very well placed. It is just 1 minute from SeaWorld, 5 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 drive from DownTime Disney and 10 minutes from the Disney resorts and the Universal resorts. There is also a pharmacy 1 minute away from the resort, too, for all you mum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and dad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Wal-Mart is 2 miles away for a food shop. So, overall. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantastic place for a family vacation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, an excellent location and 5 star service!

Upon entering the villa I noticed it was dates. The walls were dirty and one of the yellow chairs is stained. I didn't want to upset my husband and start our trip off by complaining so I just covered the couch and chair with the extra sheets provided. I checked the bed and found no bed bugs. The shower had mold and squashed dead gnats on the ceiling and bathroom walls in the master bathroom. Later, I went to use the bathroom and there was a bug about the size of a roach in there. I got upset and we killed it. Not wanting to gripe and complain I know sometimes bugs get in so I let it go. The next day there was one at the base of bedroom carpet dead. Ok this is getting bad. I am starting to get upset because we used over 120,000 points to stay in a dump. Trying to make the best of our trip and enjoy our time away I am trying to be nice and remain calm. Well, we woke up this morning to find a bug crawling on the mater bath sink. I have had enough and called the front desk. They sent someone up to our room with ant and roach spray. He sprayed the bug and the entire sink with the spray. The bathroom and the bedroom carpets. However, the guy used it like it was Lysol spray and sprayed the air so now our room stinks so bad. It is our last night here in this dump and we have to have headaches from the smell of the spray. Not to mention. The sink is now covered in bug spray and we are to brush our teeth and put our personal things here. I don't think so. I decided to go to the smaller room in the villa but didn't do any good now guess what's in there? Yep another bug! This place is not up to Marriott standards. We stayed in May and June at Harbour lake directly across the street it was great and clean. But free from bugs! I am really worried about carrying bugs home with us. We will not be back to this property nor would I recommend it to any of our family or friends. The only nice thing about this place is the landscaping. Stay away from here and the BUGS!

Plus having 3 tvs was great too. Often people debate whether to stay on or off site while visiting Disney - the time to all the parks we visited sure was better than taking Disney transportation. It took us 45 minutes on a Disney bus from Downtown Disney to visit the Boardwalk Hotel. Knowing the Boardwalk is less than 10 mins from DTD, we were shocked at how long it took to get to this hotel. It took us 30 minutes on the bus to return to DTD. Next time will would just take our car. From all other Disney parks, it took us 12-15 minutes to get back to Cypress Harbour once we were in our car. This made taking a mid-afternoon break from the parks very easy to do.

We had a two bedroom condo and there were six of us. I have Hyatt timeshare standards, but i was pleasantly surprised. The condo was clean and our unit was very convenient to getting around the property. Inside, we found really everything one would need, particularly if you have stayed in condos before. Enough bedding and towels. The master bedroom was very large, however, the big jacuzzi tub was really a waste of space and the only negative about this unit was that the master bath is really part of the master bedroom which makes it difficult for one to sleep in if the other partner is getting showered and dressed. Aside from this, we found the beds comfortable in all rooms. In the second bedroom, there was a queen bed as well as a small sleeper sofa. When the sleeper sofa was opened, you really could not get to the dresser, but that really was not a big deal for us. There was a screened in porch with table and chairs and it was nice to sit outside and watch our kids play on the volleyball court. Two pools, both of which were great in the heat. We were also able to take advantage of the high speed internet in the room, which my kids loved for their ITOUCHs and me for my computer. I chose not to have maid service for the additional charge,but instead, washed a load of clothes and towels during the trip. Worked out fine. This property is very convenient to Disney and Universal.

If you have older kids, I'd recommend requesting buildings 64 or 65, which are right by the favorite pool used by our gang of teens. Given that we were with a bunch of friends, we were in 3 different rooms, and other than one little palmetto bug, I didn't see any pests that would annoy or bother anyone. Bedding is fine - they provide foam pillows upon request if the down pillows are too large or uncomfortable. The kitchens are updated with granite (or granite-like) counters and a full stock of dishes and pans to allow meal preparation. There is room for a family of 6 if they all get along (!), though a family of 3, 4 or 5 would be more comfortable. The pentagon-shaped screened porches are a nice touch, making it a nice place to have your morning muffin and coffee.

They also sold all types of snacks, pool toys etc. The poolside bar was great as were the bartenders. The pools were very clean. There were three separate pool areas, the island pool, the clubhouse pool and the bayside pool. We never used the bayside pool, but it looked nice when we walked past. We spent our time at the other two pools and had a great time doing so. Our kids had a blast meeting other kids and playing in the pool. The grounds of the resort were so beautiful.

This time we got an excellent deal by booking through redweek.com rather than the Marriott directly - highly recommend this process. Hopefully the following comments will help you decide whether you want to choose this resort. We have been to Orlando 10 times and have seen many of the properties that are available there - we have also stayed at a variety of hotels ranging from a La Quinta level to Westin and JW Marriott level properties. What we love about this resort over other Orlando timeshare resort options: 1. Location, location, location - what we love about the location is not it's proximity to anything in particular (although it is very close to the outlet mall, sea world and several nice restaurants), but rather how the property is situated in such a secluded and quiet location - it is nowhere near any busy roads or interstates as are MANY of the other vacation club properties - it is surrounded by other resorts or golf course. We find this seclusion very relaxing especially in such a busy place like Orlando. We love not being able to see a highway or road from anywhere on the property. 2. Landscaping and villa views - we also love the lush mature landscaping - many many palm trees, immaculately cared for grounds. Also, very important to us is that there are NO units that overlook a parking lot, road or worse a highway. All units have a view of the golf course or lake. We have always requested a villa on the main lake and have always received what we requested. Maps of the property are available online and I encourage you to look at one and send in a building request prior to your visit. Some of the buildings are far away from the pools - I am happy we have not been in any of those. We were in building 64 and we loved the location. What may be a problem for you: 1. The layout of the villa - the second bedroom is VERY small - only one queen size bed and a sofa bed - but it is so cramped that you would not be able to walk around in the room if the sofa bed were open - our kids (boy and girl teenager) cannot sleep in the same bed so our now 17 year old 6 foot son had to sleep on the sofa bed in the living room - he found the bed very uncomfortable this time - last time he like it but of course he was much smaller then - (2 years ago). So this may be a problem for you if your situation is similar. Unfortunately we likely would not be able to stay here again because of this. 2. Travel to Disney world - we do not visit Disney world while we are staying at this resort - we stay on Disney property - however if you are visiting these parks you may find the traffic and travel time consuming depending on what time of year you are visiting. But, it is no farther than many of the time share resorts in this area. 3. The need for a rental car - or the use of a taxi - there is no way to get to restaurants, grocery stores, shopping or them parks without the use of either a taxi or rental car - we always get a rental car - but if you planned carefully - a few taxi rides to select destinations may be cheaper. 4. No on site restaurant - we have a rental car so it doesn't matter to us- but it would be nice to be able to eat at the resort once or twice - the only options are \"fast food\" items or pizza hut. This is not enough of an issue to prevent us from staying here. Hope this helps you decide. A few other miscellaneous info: 1. There is a new gym - it is beautiful and very well equipped - we used it everyday - unfortunately they removed one of the tennis courts to build the gym so if you are really into tennis you may want to stay elsewhere - there is only one court left and it is well used. 2. There is also a brand new spa - it was not open yet when we were there but is open now - maybe that's important to you. 3. We purchased our park passes from Maple Leaf Tickets (on line or in Kissimmee) - we saved almost $100 on Disney passes and $50 on Universal tickets over Marriott or Disney prices. 4. There is a brand new Super Walmart on Turkey Lake Road - very easy access from resort - less than a 10 minute drive. 5. We ordered pizza from Flipper's Pizza - yummy and also less than a 10 minute drive.

We've stayed in many resorts over the years and we would call the Cypress Harbour average. Our biggest complaint is that it is VERY spread out. It felt like our family was separated the entire time, and we found ourselves constantly on cells phones and texting to figure out where everyone was at any given time. It also meant a lot of walking. We were in building 70 so nothing was close by. Walking, walking and more walking. Not a big deal normally, but if you've been to resorts where things are more centralized and somewhat consolidated, it's just far more convenient. It also didn't help that we had asked for a room near the pools and were told it was highly likely we would get it, but then we didn't. One thing we found irritating as well was the amount of nickel and diming at this resort. Everything has a fee. You want to ride a bike around the grounds? $10 You want to go fishing in the lake? $$ You want to play poolside bingo? $5 per card. And the list goes on. I guess that's the Orlando model, but when you are paying the kind of money you do at the Cypress Harbour, it seems reasonable to expect that the kids could play bingo by the pool without having to bring the wallet. Drinks at the pool area bar are also very expensive. Other things that I would put under the category of \"corner cutters\" and minor irritants included the undersized basketball courts with bald, lop-sided balls, sand all over the greens on the mini-golf course, undersized towels that don't cover even half of your lounge chair by the pool, completely absent housekeeping, staff golf carts taking up all the best parking spots in front of the buildings, rock hard beds, very small second bedroom, and horribly uncomfortable pull-out beds for the kids. If you are in Orlando for the parks and are looking for a convenient location with decent amenities, Cypress Harbour may be ok for you. If you've been there done that with the parks and are just looking for a nice resort to spend time with the family, you could probably do better elsewhere.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cprobably won't stay here again\u201d", "Author": "shawnla", "ReviewID": "UR102650344", "Content": "This was our 2nd stay at this resort.

There is also a screened-in porch with a table big enough for 4 (or even 6) where we had several of our meals as it overlooked the pond and had a nice breeze. There's a nice TV in every room, the wi-fi was free and fast. It was silly to have to pay to print out our boarding passes in the \"business center\", which is just 2 computers and a printer.

No rude experiences although building 57 sits by the Houskeeping garage area and it gets LOUD come break time in the afternoon. Several ongoing rec aactivities and several pools that we couldn't take advantage of, with the exception of renting a surrey bike. The splash Pad and 2 pool selection with waterslide acrosss the street at Harbour Lake seem to be better options, although the pools are maintained nicely.

Also a Dunkin Donuts at the intersection of Westwood and International Drive and a back entrance to The Orlando Premium Outlets and Publix, making the location unbeatable.

We would definitely go back again and recommend it to others. Staff: Check in was very quick and efficient. The crew at the gatehouse was very friendly and on my daily runs would even open the gate for me so I could run through it (rather than around it). The housekeeping staff was courteous and efficient and the groundscrew were great. My nephew and I even got a ride back from the pool to our room one day in one of the little carts they have and he thought that was awesome! The staff members at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 by the pool were a little slow and disorganized at times, but the people who led the games like bingo were a lot of fun. Facilities: The grounds of the place were really lovely. Very neatly maintained and right by a golf course, so plenty of grass, trees and native plants. There was a lake area behind the buildings which was pretty and had some nice fountains in it. There was an activity area on the north side of the complex (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big complex, so you could easily walk a quarter mile going from one area to another) which had bocce ball and things like that. The pools were very nice and there were plenty of chairs, of course we were there in October and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that crowded and I imagine it would get very packed during the peak season. The units were great. We had two, two-bedroom units that were mirror images of each other. There was plenty of room for all of us and each unit had laundry, a kitchen, dining area and large living room area. There were two separate bathrooms, which was nice. The smaller bedroom was still a good size but the master bedroom was very large with a huge Jacuzzi tub in the middle and a separate toilet and shower area. The master bedroom also had two sinks which made getting ready in the morning easy. The rooms all had big screen televisions and free internet. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big fan of free internet. Beds and pillows were very comfortable and I slept soundly each night. Shades are very good so you can really keep the room dark and block the Florida sun in the morning! Highlights: I loved the area of the big pool that had lots of bubbles and jets. There were a few separate Jacuzzi-type tubs as well, but the little area of the large pool with the jets was very relaxing and the cool pool water was very refreshing. Having the kitchen was great. It was so much easier to eat a little something in the morning and head to the parks rather than trying to coordinate a sit down breakfast at a restaurant for seven people. The screened in back porches were great for having coffee in the morning. There are plenty of activities to participate in at the resort if you have an off day from the parks. I needed two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recharge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd days and sitting by the pool with a beer and a book was awesome. Also, I like to run and it was easy to find great areas to run around the complex as well as outside on Westwood Blvd and on International Drive. Oh, and there were grills outside the units so if you wanted to make hamburgers and hot dogs and have a picnic, you could do that. This was a cool touch. Areas for improvement: The service at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 by the pool is incredibly slow. It took 20 minutes to get a hamburger and I saw one couple who had ordered two sandwiches sit for almost 25 minutes while other people ordered after them and got their food before them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient to just walk up from the pool to get the food but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why it took so long. Additionally, although I liked the big master suite, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the sink, shower or toilet without casting a big beam of light on whoever was still asleep. There was no wall or anything separating the bed from the sink and the shower wall was opaque glass that shined light right onto the bed. It would have been nice to let the other person sleep while getting ready. Also, one of our rooms was not ready until 6:30 pm (check in was supposed to be at 4:00 pm), which seems a bit late and checkout was at 10:00 am, which is early. Location: It took us about 15 minutes to get to the various Disney parks. Seaworld is a mile away; it is very walkable if you want to save on parking. The location is 20 minutes from the airport and close to the restaurants near the Convention Center and by Lake Buena Vista. There are grocery stores and drug stores conveniently located. Overall impression: Everyone really liked this place. It was comfortable, convenient and clean. The units were nicely decorated and so spacious that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like we were on top of one another (which was good after spending 10 hours attached to each other at a theme park). It could get crowded when there are more people there, but definitely in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shoulder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd season, I would not hesitate to recommend this resort.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Brilliant\u201d", "Author": "Tobyjug111", "ReviewID": "UR85148909", "Content": "We have been exchanging for Cypress Harbour for the past 8 years and we are always delighted with the quality of accomodation and the care and attention of the staff.

My theretofore great impression - and thoughts of coming back for a longer stay with my wife - went down the toilet. I ended up sleeping in the smaller 2nd bedroom with a full bed - after a thorough examination of the sheets. When I reported this to the young cuties at the front desk they told me an \"outside company\" cleans all of their units. I asked to have their housekeeping manager call me later that day to confirm that the sheets/bedding were changed in the master king bed - and, of course, no such call ever came. Beware the property calls you way too much and leaves voice mails about all kinds of insignificant things at the resort - 5 times in 2 days for me, which borders on annoying.

All the beds, including the sleeper sofas, were very comfortable (no springs poking you in the back on the sleeper sofas). We did not rent a car. We took taxis everywhere.

There are also tennis courts, basketball courts, a small soccer field with goals, a covered pavillion with a ping pong table, and some type of shuffle board playing area. Overall, a relaxing stay. I think this is a great place to spend a relaxing vacation with easy access to the parks and shopping. There is no proper restaurant. Only a grill cafe by the pool that sells fast foods.

I know this isn't the resorts fault, but I do feel they should have sprayed before we arrived. So I called the front desk and they sent someone right away to spray, and that made them stay away for about 4 days. The rooms were great, very spacious. I was alittle disapointed with the lack of cookware in the kitchen. There was no frying pans or pizza pans or pots, or cookie sheet. So you basically couldn't cook anything. There is also no cleaning done at all unless you want to pay for it which is between 30-40 bucks. I do think there should be a midweek cleaning for free.

It was super close to Disney parks and Sea World. In fact, we only used 8 gallons of gas the whole time we were there. Overall, I loved it and cannot wait to go back. I used a bonus week through Interval International and thought this was a great value. The other Marriott resorts near there, Grande Vista and Harbour Lake, only offered an efficiency for the bonus week. Having a 2 bedroom is so much better. One thing I want to add is that if you go here and are not interested in obtaining any discounts or anything for going to a time share - do not bother with your \"gift\" at checkin. They send you to the concierge who tries to sign you up to attend something to get a discount. If you are not interested, no need to go over.

In fact, the only thing happening in the clubhouse when we went was a meeting of the resort management - and we got a few looks that suggested that we were interrupting their meeting by entering the clubhouse. The single tennis court is a disaster - clearly not maintained at all. I know I've focused on the negatives, but it really worked for us.

What makes this resort better is that it is totally secluded with lush foliage and surrounded by the beautiful Grande Pines golf course. It's like a park and very quiet. (Grande Vista's buildings stick out like a sore thumb because the property has not yet matured. Harbour Lake is in a terrible location, right on the freeway with lots of noise.) The units surround a good sized lake with a water feature in the center. I like the circular screened in porches. However, you can look right into your next door neighbors' porches as well (no privacy out there) since they are circular and right next to each other. The views make up for that. The living rooms are good sized with large circular sofas that can seat 6 people. Others have written that the second bedroom is tiny. I thought it was an okay size, just as long as the sofa bed is not pulled out. One nice thing about the room is that it has an en suite bath of its own....not large, but with a tub/shower. The master suite is just like the photos show, roomy enough and we liked the shower room with the glass block wall surround. It is true that the beds are firm, but when I woke up in the mornings, no back ache..... If booking here, call up a month or so before your arrival and ask for a unit in a building near one of the main pools, high floor and most of all, newly refurbished.......you will get it...they try hard to please. The refurbished units have the new wall mounted flat screen HD LG tv's in the living and bedrooms...46 inch in the living and master, 36 inch in the 2nd bedroom.....stainless steel appliances and granite counters throughout....new carpets, drapes and furniture...all in a semi nautical theme with royal blues and golds...all beds have the crisp white duvets (European style). Pools are very nice...but are a bit tired compared to Grande Vista...Still, the setting is tropical and just so pleasant. We especially liked the main pool by the lobby and food venues. They have live music on some days out there and loved the open air bar overlooking the pool. We were in bldg. #52, which is right next to the lobby/pool...very short walk...If you go to the Marriott vacation Club website, you can view and print out the property map of the resort and select which building you prefer. The resort is well kept and looks like it just had a fresh coat of paint on all the buildings. It only needs some near future refreshing addressed to the pool areas...tiles and patio area surround......the trees tend to drop leaves and seeds so it can get splotchy looking. The strapped patio lounges will soon need replacing...other than that, it is a home run...can't complain. One year we stayed across the road at the Harbour Lake resort (Horizons)...although it gets very high reviews here at Tripadvisor...it all has to do with the kiddie pool features, and not the noisy freeway proximity or the units, which are not nearly on the same caliber as the Cypress Harbour or Grande Vista. One thing that Grande Vista has that we really like better is the 2nd bedroom being so much larger and has a lock off feature and its own balcony and kitchenette...when another couple comes with us, they really appreciate this..and also, their beds are much more comfortable...in a few years their property will be as lush at Cypress Harbour. Both have their good points. But we were so happy at Cypress Harbour on this trip. I also have to say that the front desk staff went out of their way to make us happy. Grande Vista and Harbor Lake did not, especially Harbour Lake. This is a great place to stay as long as you do not have adults or a couple using the 2nd bedroom., unless they don'r mind a queen bed. Also, the 2nd bedroom has a window overlooking the hallway.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201cCypress Harbour amazing for young children!\u201d", "Author": "cubaloverOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR62682824", "Content": "We just returned from a two week stay at the Cypress Harbour. This is an amazing resort and a wonderful place to stay, especially if you have young children. A lot of people prefer the newer, more modern and much busier Mariott Grande Vista. My cousing was staying at the Grande at the same time so we saw both resorts and spent some time at Grande as well..Although it has more to do and more amenities, it also has a LOT more people. Lounge chairs disappear early, and there are kids everywhere, all the time, which is fine just means it's very noisy and busy. We are a family of five..a 5 year old, three year old and six month old. Cypress had two very large pools, and two kiddie pools, several playgrounds, and a lovely lake with pedal boats (cost about 12$/half hour). The days we didn't go to disney we stayed at the resort and had lots of fun. IT's only a five minute drive to seaworld and an hour to tampa for Busch gardens (which is worth the trip for the little ones and the new sesame street area, great fun!). IT's about 15 minutes to disney and five minutes to the premium outlets and a great Publix grocery store..all said very well located. The rooms are huge. They need some updating but who cares. They were clean, and we were pleased with the full size washer and dryer. The master bedroom has a bathtub you could fit five in, and it's a whirlpool. Screened in deck overlooks the lake. This resort is very quiet with large well maintained grounds. I suggest staying in building 64 since it's right between the pool and the activity center..if you have young children you'll know how important it is to not have a long walk in case you forget something. We had a wonderful two weeks here, and would recommend this place to anyone who is going to Orlando. It's so welll located, and the staff are unbeatable. Polite and helpful at every turn. ( Grande Vista was nice, don't get me wrong, but HUGE, so if your room is not the closest, you could have a very long walk to any activities..my cousin was far and it was not fun getting back and forth with the kids.) The fitness center is also amazing..up to date with personal tvs attached to the treadmills. I used it every two days and found it quiet and always a machine available. If you're flying from Canada I may recommend Westjet..amazing service with young children, we always fly them and have always had a great flight..not an easy task with three kids under the age of five!

Great view of lake and boathouse area and not a far walk from the clubhouse pool or even the Bay Pool.

They needed to fix our safe and a washer and immediately responded with friendliness and replaced both very quickly. They will try to get you to go to a presentation at the Grand Lakes property. If you can afford 90 minutes and you want either some Marriott money (100) or discounts off golf, etc, not a bad idea. I'm sure most folks can't afford the time (unless you are serious about buying there). It was pretty outstanding since it shares acres with JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton.

We were there to do Disney, Universal, Cocoa Beach and some shopping so we liked this location with easy access right off I-4 because it was in the center of things and extremely convenient. I have nothing bad to say about the Cypress Harbour at all. The staff was exceptional in all aspects. At check-in, the gal showed us the property map, explained the layout, and then let us choose any building we wanted. We got the normal pressure from the \"concierge/timeshare host\" but after telling them 'not interested' there was no further pressure; no calls to the room, etc. And the cleaning/maintenance staff has to be some of the hardest working that I've ever seen. Every day they were out there cleaning pooldecks, activity areas, sidewalks, etc. The property is just spotless. As for the condo itself, the rooms are very nice and spacious. Ours was a 2 BR with a decent sized kitchen, laundry room, and 2 nice bathrooms. If privacy is an issue the master bathroom can be a little odd. The jacuzzi tub is in the main bedroom, and the shower has a see-through, opaque glass wall to the bedroom. The interior design is a little dated (reminded us of The Golden Girls), but the furniture and fixtures were in very good condition so it seemed like this decor couldn't possibly be 20 years old. I wish we had used it more, but I loved the screened-in lanai also. Free internet in the condo, but it's not Wireless. So I saved the best for last: the property itself. I doubt you could find a property with more to do right on-site. 3 large pools - my favorite being the island pool, plus numerous small kiddie pools and hot tubs. Paddle boats, bike rentals, shuffleboard, basketball courts, outdoor ping pong and billiards, bocce ball, and the list goes on. Also included is one of the nicest workout facilities I've ever seen in a timeshare, with high-end equipment. We didn't have kids with us, but there is a kid activity area also and it appeared to be heavily used by families staying on property, so it told me that it wasn't just for show. There's also a golf course that winds itself through the property. I asked about it, but unfortunately didn't get time to play a round. The clubhouse is actually not on-site and is down the road a short ways. Green fees were $85, or $55 after 2pm. Overall, we'd go back.

Accompanying us on this trip were my sister and her family who were placed in a condo beside us after we had made the request a few months earlkier. For this we were greatly thankful. The accommodations were roomy, clean, and spacious. We particularly liked the fact that the master bedroom was on the other side of the condomimium and away from the other bedroom. We think that the kids liked their privacy as well. Granite countertops, new appliances, and comfortable beds were standard in the units, and the two bedroom layout allowed for a spacious living room area. Yet despite the positives, there were a couple of negative points that do bear mentioning: our check-in went seamlessly but my sister and her family had to wait until after 5:00 pm until they were allowed in (check-in is at 4:00 pm). Marriott did make amends by allowing for a later check-out time as well as providing a gift certificate. Their week continued to get off to a shaky start as two cockroaches were found in the unit and the AC froze up during the night. Both were attended to by housekeeping and maintenance, and the rest of the week was problem-free. The television in the master bedroom in our unit was a Magnavox that had a bit of a snowy picture. We checked the cable connections, but they were fine so we don't have an explanation for this cause. The TV's in the living room and guest bedroom were both fine picturewise. Despite a couple of bumps in the road at the outset. Cypress Harbour is a beautiful resort with kind and courteous staff.

We stayed here on a promo for the Marriott Vacation Club, and added 3 nights as renters of this beautiful time share property. It was myself, my two boys (5 & 7) and my father, who we took on vacation as a present. Check in was easy, with friendly service. From the moment we walked in our villa, we knew we picked the right place ! So spacious for the family. The master bedroom was enormous with double sinks, and a massive tub (which we didn't use). We stayed in building 54, close to the club pool. This pool is pretty big with two hot tubs and a kiddie pool. Across the way, is the island pool with tons of activities. We were so busy visiting the parks and family, we only stayed near the club pool when we had the time. I could have spent another day just exploring. Staying on an end unit is great, on the 3rd of 4th floor, to avoid \"next door\" noise. Most of the time, other than by the pool, we felt we were the only ones there other than the workers driving by in their golf carts always waving hello. Near us was the Island Grill, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, and Krispy Cream Donuts in the store. We bought groceries for breakfast and snacks at the nearby Publix, and enjoyed our full kitchen and daily room service. When you are an owner of a time share, I think you only get maid service on the first day. As a renter, you get it every day. They give you 8 pool towels (two were in the 2nd bath) to use for the pool and they would exchange them for new pool towels daily if needed. The 2nd bedroom is perfect size, except when you pull out the sofa bed. We didn't use that one, but the sofa bed in front of the TV for the kids. I would recommend that kids sleep there as it doesn't look to comfy for adults. The \"grown up\" beds were very comfortable with celing fans in both bedrooms. There were 3 TVs, and a DVD and VCR player. They have DVD rentals in the lobby as well. The washer/dryer room was so convenient as we did 3 loads of laundry (they give you one complimentary detergent but I packed some extra in my suitcase in a plastic bag with some bounce). They also have an on site photographer if you want family pictures taken. Through our promo, we got a free 5 x 7. You can buy all the tickets for the parks there, at small discounted rates to avoid lines. Sea World is a mile away, as well as many great restaurants. I recommend Bahama Breeze and Lone Star Steakhouse. Good for families and reasonably priced. They even have a place to print your boarding passes in the lobby. With Southwest, you need to check in early to get a good section. They have FREE internet service in the rooms, and we had our laptop hooked up the whole time for us and the kids when we were in the room. Safe in the master closet as well. We are going back next year but staying at the Harbour Villas directly across the street for the kids - as they have the pirate theme for kids at the pool even though are kids were just as happy playing around in the regular pools.

We are owners at another Marriott resort and traded a week for a Spring Break trip with the three kids to Disney. The reviews posted here were spot on. Cypress Harbour met and exceeded our expectations (and we like nice things, places, restaurants, etc.) The villas are large (yes, the second bedroom is small especially when the sofa bed is pulled out, but our two boys did just fine in it.) Our daughter used the sleeper sofa in the living room and in that way had her \"own\" room too. We never felt cramped or on top of each other. Having a full kitchen and washer/dryer is a must for us. Prior to our arrival we ordered and had groceries delivered. We cooked at least one meal every day and ran a load of wash each day too. While we did do the parks for 5 out of the 7 days, the two days spent at the resort were a lot of fun. We could have spent another week just laying by the pools, enjoying the lake, and playing ping pong, etc. The kids even did one night at the Kids Club while mom and dad had an evening out. They went fishing, played video games, ate pizza, played basketball and did crafts. They thought their night out without mom and dad was great too! Several years ago we did the same trip but stayed at the Marriott Grande Lakes. We much preferred Cypress Harbor! We would stay at the Cypress Harbour again without reservation. It was also nice to be off of Disney property for the quiet .... I could never do Disney 24/7!!! My husband has a hard time just doing Disney for more than 6 hours!! We could leave a crowded park and be \"home\" in 15 minutes before anyone truly melted down. If you are traveling with kids, like space, privacy, quiet, and many of the comforts of home, you can't go wrong with the Cypress Harbour. I spent hours and hours making sure we stayed at what would be the best place for our family and this was it!!", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cNice Resort, Disappointing Service and Policies\u201d", "Author": "globetrottermom", "ReviewID": "UR27810654", "Content": "I just returned from Cypress Harbour where we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite as an exchange owner (our family owns several weeks at other Marriott Vacation Club locations). While the resort is for the most part very nice, there were a few infuriating things about the place that keep me from writing a more positive review. The service at this resort is friendly, yet ineffective. For example, after 4 answered calls over the course of the day to the concierge to make a dinner reservation I ended up having to trek down to the office to find a human to speak with. Once there, the concierge was friendly, but the point is, 4 calls and an in person trip should not be required to get anything done. Similarly, it took 3 calls to replace a dirty blanket for my son's bed. On the subject of blankets, I found the following infuriating: In the lovely, spacious, well appointed master suite there is a comfy bed with a lovely duvet. In the minuscule second bedroom there is a comfy queen bed with the same duvet and a bony mattress pull out sofa with an acrylic blanket. My two boys did not wish to share a bed so the youngest opted for the pull out. Upon making the bed I saw that the acrylic blanket was not only sad, it was covered in hair. This is when I placed call #1 for a blanket. I asked if they could send a duvet so my sons could both have the same bedding. The answer was: \"No, it's against our policy to\". There was plenty of vacancy, what trouble would it have been for them to provide one? Disappointed, I said that we would settle for a blanket that didn't have pubic hair on it. After 3 calls, one arrived. One sad, synthetic blanket. To me, as an owner especially, unacceptable. The blanket was not comfortable for my son, so I tried again and again, was rebuffed. They offered to send a comforter, which sounded like a fair substitute. When the \"comforter\" arrived it was an old slippery nylon bed spread, probably retired from an older unit. Icky. Ordinarily, properties like this do what they can to make owners and guests happy and comfortable during their stay. At Cypress Harbour I heard a whole lot of NO and little, if nothing was done to make my stay comfortable. Given the cost of owning and maintaining 2 bedroom units, this is unacceptable. The resort makes it clear that there are 3 classes of guest: 1. Renters (the lowest on the totem pole-- good luck to you if you fall into this category), 2. Exchange owners (second class citizens as I experienced) and 3. Owners (perhaps they are nicer to you, I can only hope). When I called about daily tidy service I was told that it was only for owners-- if I wanted this service I could do so for a fee. Apparently owning several weeks in Marriott isn't good enough to get your waste basket emptied and your bed made. Tisk tisk. My other complaint lies in the layout of the second bedroom. For all the massive space of the 2 bedroom villa, the second bedroom is cramped. When the pull out sofa is opened there is hardly any room to move about and you cannot open the dresser. Every time you want to get something out of the dresser or closet you need to fold up the bed. Annoying. Especially considering the vast amount of space in the rest of the villa. I would only return to this property again if I were to speak with a manager ahead of time to insure that both my children could obtain comfortable bedding. Aside from the complaints with the slow response time and bedding the resort itself was well appointed and comfortable.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBest place in Orlando!\u201d", "Author": "Altitude9600", "ReviewID": "UR27541793", "Content": "I was amazed by Cypress Harbour.

Now we are not tv people but I can see where that might have been nice. The only thing we ever check on vacation is the weather channel and the kids watch nick. The best part of the layout was the kids' bedroom was on the opposite end of the unit from the master, so it was very private, and the kids bed and bath could be closed off completely from the rest of the unit by a door, so in a sense it was like having two masters. Overall just a well-thought out floor plan and both baths were big and had tubs. The master had an enormous spa tub and a shower plus double sinks. The kitchen was also very well laid out with a bar, granite counter tops, dishwasher, etc. Super nice! The unit also had its own laundry room with full-size washer and dryer, which are indispensable if you ask me.

The rooms are as advertised and as reviewed here. I found the beds very comfortable and our teen who slept on the pull out sofa in the second bedroom even said that provided a good night's sleep. We were in building 64 \"Islamadora\" and this was a great location - on the lake with a lovely view from the porch (we even caught a slight view of the fireworks at 9pm each night). Close to the pools (there are 3 of them) and close to the activity and boating center. My parents stayed with us and we never felt crowded since the units are so spacious. We would prefer a larger second bedroom with 2 beds instead of the one bed and pull out sofa. The hot tub in the master is just a huge waste of space - it seems Marriott has dispensed with these old space hogs in their newer timeshares - yeah! We enjoyed the island pool but found the hot tubs here sub standard as most of the jets simply did not work. The clubhouse pool was great and the hot tubs there were toasty and operating perfectly. We did not use the smaller third pool by the activity center but my parents thought is was a PLUS that this pool was designated quiet and adults only for portions of the day which, had we spent more time there, they felt they would have really enjoyed. We enjoyed the activity center - rented a pontoon boat which was fun. My daughter loved ferrying me around the lake. We also did spend one day at the resort and did the tie-dye activity and played some video games in the arcade and enjoyed the ice cream sundae offering. My parents also caught the Hawaiian Luau one night at the clubhouse and while they thought it would be better outdoors (it was held indoors due to cold weather) they really enjoyed the show. Bottom line, there is enough to do here to just relax and enjoy the resort. Acitivites we wish we had done: rented the quad bikes, done the mini golf course and done a second round out on the lake in the swan paddle boats. This being said, however, I (and the kids) do believe the \"fun\" factor for kids is higher at the more elaborately pirate themed Marriott Horizons across the street where we stayed this same time last year but you can't beat the comfort and relaxed atmosphere here at Cypress. Our only (and minor) complaints: The kitchen just did not have enough pans and bakeware - we had only a single fry pan that was not non-stick and EVERYTHING stuck to it making a disaster of a morning when we tried to make pancakes and left us juggling to cook the bacon. They need more than a single fry pan and please make it nonstick! We also bought muffins and quick bread to make only to find no muffin pans and no loaf pans - kind of ruined our scheme for quick and easy breakfasts. I guess they just assume folks really don't cook even though they provide a full kitchen? I also didn't like the sub par hot tubs at the island pool - I made the kids go to the clubhouse pool every time even though it was further away. My parents also complained of an electrical fan/humming noise at night although we did not hear this in the other bedroom. I also found the shower layout in the master a bit odd - the toilet and shower are enclosed in a seperate room while the sinks and whirlpool tub are open to the room itself. However, the shower also has a frosted glass wall that also is viewable from the room. I guess they plan on couples only in the masters at Marriotts (the shower was also viewable from the room itself at Horizons) but it offers less privacy than some might want if sharing without a significant other. My daughter and I actually shared the master and I routinely found myself banned from the room as she showered due to lack of privacy! Not a big deal - but a bit strange - these are not \"honeymoon\" suites - they are family oriented - just give folks some privacy in the shower already! Overall we'd recommend this resort is you want a spacious, bright, comfortable place to stretch out and relax. I can't imagine why folks would pack their families into tiny hotel rooms at Disney prices when you can have a spacious full living room, kitchen and two seperate bedrooms at Marriott vacation properties. If your younger kids want a higher \"fun\" factor - stay across the street at Horizons. If you want comfort, quiet, lovely grounds and many nice pool options - stay at Cypress.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cEven Better Than We Expected\u201d", "Author": "RMFD94", "ReviewID": "UR25349952", "Content": "My family and I just returned from a week's stay at Cypress Harbour.

Compared to the miles we walked during the course of days at EPCOT and the Magic Kingdom, it was nothing. And speaking of Disney, it was such a relief at the end of a LONG day at the parks to arrive back at Cypress Harbour. There is such a thing as Disney overload (i.e. the crowds, the noise, the theme music, the lines) and it was good to get away from it. The best advice we followed from a previous reviewer is to stock up on supplies at the Publix supermarket about a mile away (you can find it quickly using GPS). We bought water to take with us each day at the parks and also stocked up on breakfast supplies (cereal, milk, juice, muffins and fruit) to have each morning in our suite.

There were two minor issue with the tv remote not working properly and the glass plate in the microwave being too large to turn, so food did not heat properly. One night returning at 11 from the parks with two sleeping children in our arms, the key to the suite didn't work. As you can imagine, this was a drag.

The unsettling thing about this is that in order for this lock to be in place and the damage to be done, someone had to be in the room with the lock in place when it happened. Housekeeping was very kind, keeping up with the tremendous mess caused by me being out at the parks all day and dh being parked in the room!

However, this is a matter of opinion.We were pleased with the size of the rooms and the facilities within but the furnishings are, for want of a better word, tatty. This particularly applied to the wood furnishings, such as TV cabinets, dressers, etc which were chipped and worn. Come on, Marriott. Its a lovely place but you get better furnishing in much lower priced properties. After all, it is not in any way a value priced resort. Also, 10am checkout is a bit ridiculous, even for Florida.

We joined my sister who arranged this resort for us as she had special rates. We spent one week at Cypress and my sister gave me the honeymoon bedroom which had a jacuzzi as she took the smaller bedroom. The unit consisted of two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen with stove, refrigerator and other appliances including dishwasher as well as a washer and clothes dryer. The unit also had a screened porch as well as three large flat screen TV sets (one in each bedroom and other in the parlor) I really enjoyed myself and it was really total relaxation especially after a day of visiting one of the Disneyworld Parks. You dont confront other residents, you just relax. What was especially good was our unit was centrally located and it was on the ground floor. The swimming pool and whirlpool was nearby and the fitness room as well as the rental/activity center was next door. My wife and I did the minature golf and the theme two person paddling boat which was shaped as a white swan. You paddle around their man made lake. You can even fish there. I did not check in or out as my sister was responsible. She even drove the the day before (from the Panama City area) to spend the night at the Resort so when we arrived we would go directly to our unit as our flight from Hawaii was a long one. The maid did come in the first day but after that you were on your own. Heck, when the towels were dirty we washed it ourselves. Resort employees were always cordial and explained things in a cheerful manner . The only slight perfection was the water temperature in the room jacuzzi did not really get hot but only lukewarm. Marriott needs to invest in larger and more powerful hot water heaters...I deducted a third of a point for this and my final rating was 4.66 out of a 5.00 for the Cypress Harbour. Beside selecting Cypress Harbour and paying for this lodging my sister (Brenda) also treated us to see Blue Man Group at the Universal Studios Theme Park.

We are not members of Marriott Vacation Club, but we have stayed at Grande Vista for a couple of nights. We wanted the extra space so that our son could stay with us. Check-in was great; everyone was friendly. My daughter asked about the nature trail, and we were told by the clerk at the front desk that she had never been on it because she heard there were gators and snakes on the trail. Enough said there; we skipped that. Upon arriving at our unit, everything looked great. Then we discovered there was only one bed in the second bedroom. Nobody wanted a pull-out, so my son went back to his place 1-1/2 hours away. After going to the bathroom, I found that we could see through the glass shower wall from the bedroom in detail. That was fine. We could live with it.....until the next morning. It took at least 10 minutes to get warm water. I had to flip the shower handle around a few times to find out where the hot water was located. It was only lukewarm. So I went to the 2nd bathroom to get a shower. I got up early, so that was no problem. I let the water run a few minutes to an acceptable temp., then almost got in the tub. I looked down at the water accumulating in the shower, and there was white globs of soap and scum. No way was I getting a shower here. I went back to the big bathroom and decided I'd brave the colder water, which had now warmed up a bit more. I got in the shower and felt like I was putting on a show to anyone in the BR. My husband said the same thing. Our daughter refused to use her bathroom and came into ours while we went outside. She took a quick shower, let me tell you. But because of all of us having to use only one bathroom, we were late checking out. That's another thing. Can you believe for a stay of one night (we would have stayed longer if things were more acceptable and if our son could have stayed with us), we had to check out at 10 am? Good grief! The unit looked dated and worn out, even though we were told at check-in that they were putting us in a newly renovated building. Ha! Newly renovated, but dirty and not really finished construction-wise. The bathrooms were missing some moldings and weren't finished off. The walls in the bathrooms were filthy, and all doors were grimy on and around doorknobs. Bugs were everywhere. I'm glad we didn't use the pool or public areas. Can you imagine how clean they might be if housekeeping could not clean one bathtub? The outside lights stay on all the time and cannot be turned off. So if you go out at night, be prepared for a million bugs to come in when you open the front door. There was also something about the security that I felt very uncomfortable with. The gatehouse was fine, but there was something unnervy once we got into the unit. This place would be so beautiful if housekeeping took a little more time. I'm used to staying in hotels and motels, over 50 nights a year. I'm used to bugs and a little dirty housekeeping. But why would I want to pay over $8,000 and up to $20,000 to join a MVC to get a dump like this?

The resort is clean, people are friendly, the pools are great and not too crowded, the location is perfect to get to Disney, Universal, or International Drive. Really our only \"complaint\" was the size of the second bedroom. We are a family of 5 (mom, dad, and 3 teenagers). The master bedroom is huge with a king size bed, jacuzzi, and large bath area with 2 sinks. The second bedroom is tiny with one queen/double bed a pullout sofa. When you pulled out the sofa to accommodate 3 kids in the room, there was no room to move or even open dresser drawers. We always stay in 2 bedroom condo types of resorts and we have always had 2 double beds in the second bedroom. It just seemed to be an odd use of space to make the master bedroom huge and the second one tiny. We ended up having one kid in the bed, one in the pullout in the bedroom, and one in the pullout in the livingroom (the sectional also has a pullout). It was just inconvenient if one of the kids wanted to get into the dresser or closet, they couldn't if their brother was still asleep in the pullout in the bedroom. Other than that, the boys enjoyed the basketball courts and we loved the screened porch to sit and have coffee in the morning. We also had a problem with the refrigerator fan freezing up and making a very loud (almost jet engine quality) noise. When I called to have it fixed, someone came right away. However, the next day, it started again. We called again, they came again to fix it, but it started up with the noise the next day. We spent a lot of time at Universal and ate out every night so we just didn't bother to pursue it. I think that particular unit will need a new frig. While we pointed out some slight issues, overall it really is a very family friendly resort. I would consider staying there again but only when my oldest is in college and I would only have 2 kids in tow instead of three. I think for families with younger kids, it would be fantastic.

Check-in was courteous, prompt and efficient. (Thank you Barbara). We requested in advance and received a corner unit on the top (third) floor. Our unit was beautifully decorated and was huge.

Each of the bedrooms also had its own tv set. A desk midway between the kitchen and living room provided a work area with wired internet access. The public areas had wireless access.

The last page has a family scavenger hunt game. Answer the questions and bring it to the Activities Center for a VIP card. This gives you discounts on some activities and allows you to do some for free. We also participated in some of the games and were given prizes of free bike and boat rentals. In addition, we played tennis daily, and tried shuffleboard, billiards and mini-golf. Activity Center employees were all enthusiastic and friendly. Of course, we spent time in the Florida sun by one of the three pools. There were always chairs and loungers available in the sun or shade. We had no problem with people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reserving\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chairs who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there. The Island pool and Bayside pool were quieter when we visited them. We spent most of our pool time at the Clubhouse pool since it was adjacent to the outside bar and Market Grill Caf\u00c3\u00a9. We enjoyed salads and lunch items at the caf\u00c3\u00a9. We used the hot tubs by the pools, but never did get to the sauna. We generally ate breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and had lunch at the pool. We stocked up on food at the beginning of the week at the Super Wal-Mart, about 20 minutes away. There is also a Publix supermarket that is closer; we made an end of the week run there for some additional supplies. Dinners we ate out at one of the numerous local restaurants. We did take a day trip to Melbourne Beach (about an hour away) to swim in the ocean, and to view the PostSecrets exhibit at the Brevard Art Museum.

There were plenty of moderately priced restaurants to choose from on International Drive. We recommend Bahama Breeze for sure! To get to the Disney parks, you make a right out of the resort and a left at the next light to jump on I-4. The main pool at the resort was wonderful. Plenty of lounge chairs, clean pool water, and maintenance people walking around sweeping, cleaning, etc. We especially liked the tables with the umbrellas so that you can sit and eat your lunch.

This is how it began.... With rising costs of everything it was a big decision for us to spend money to take a family vacation - me, husband and 14yr old twin daughters. Once it was decided we would go for it and a destination was chosen it was my mission to find the ideal spot that would satisfy my VERY picky family's tastes - all of which never fail to be different! Coming from Colorado I didn't find many of my local connections with much knowledge of places to stay in Orlando so I spent many hours researching more locations than you can imagine and became dependent on reviews from Trip Advisor as well as other review sites. Our budget allowed me to look at higher end accomodations so I ruled out the typical less expensive chain hotels early on. After many hours it was narrowed down to: A high end resort hotel at Universal or Disney- PROS - accessibility to park and lots of entertainment around. CONS-very expensive or typical oversized 2 bed, 1 bath hotel room that was more affordable but still high price. Not the best arrangement for my husband spending 5 nites with the 3 women in his life - girls pack alot of junk! Plus, the reviews I read didn't help, seems the added expenses associated with staying at these places can be a bit much. This might have been more attractive if my kids were younger and wanted to be in the middle of all the craziness of these theme parks. Thankfully, we all said no. Marriott Cypress Harbor Resort - PROS - 2 bedroom, 2 bath, kitchen, living room, screened deck condo, washer/dryer. What more can I say there. Price - MUCH more tolerable. We saved on meals by going to grocery store and not eating out every meal, especially breakfast, cereal/toast is the typical choice. During down time - 3 tvs made everyone happy. The unit was very clean, the screened porch kept those nasty little bugs from bugging us - not used to so many bugs coming from Colorado. If I was really being critical I would suggest a little updating but really no big deal. We had a great location - a building about half way between activity center and island pool, main pool and store/grill. My very independent 14 yrs olds were all about doing things are their own, without mom/dad, and we were very comfortable letting them be out and about into the early evening. They loved that! The grounds were beautiful, well kept and clean. We did come across some interesting creepy crawlies - once again, not seen where we come from. One morning there was a large black snake sunning near the pool deck - we took some pictures and it slithered off into safety. We kept hoping to see an alligator for some thrills - don't see those in CO. The pools were beautiful, hardly crowded while we were there. Evening resort entertainment was fun. We did the paddle boats - don't pay for more than 1/2 hr - its a leg killer. Played giant chess, ping pong, basketball and mini golf. It was all perfect, despite excessive heat and humidity we are not accustomed to. Thank goodness for the washer/dryer, I changed my clothes twice a day. The staff was all friendly and helpful, bartenders shared lots of valuable info, conceriege was helpful, we had a later flight home and front staff graciously let us extend our check out a little later to take the final advantage of this wonderful place. This is the place to stay! As long as you have your own car, it's easy to get around town and to those crazy theme parks. Our final family thought - we got to experience the theme parks - don't need to return to those anytime soon. But we would definitely make a vacation out of just staying at this resort and doing nothing more than hanging out and having fun. We wished we could have stayed longer - that was the only CON - fitting in the theme park experience didn't leave us enough time to take advantage of this great spot so we would like to return to do so!

The maid service ran the dishwasher and took out trash etc. Two small complaints that I had, was the lighting in the master bedroom. There was no way to turn on the lights at night without disturbing the other person in the room as the jacuzzi tub was in the same room and the bathroom shower was a glass pane into the bedroom as well. This could easily be rectified by bringing a small night lite with you on the trip. Also, we were in a room that backed up to a tee box.

The shower itself is decent size but the shower head could use updating. Also, the towels are very thin and not that soft. The hangers are the thin plastic kind and not very good for hanging pants.

My husband and I purchased a week from a timeshare resale site, and we could not have been more pleased. From start to finish, the stay was amazing. Check-in (even at 2am) was speedy, and we got everything we asked for--including a ground floor for my handicapped mother and a pack and play for my seven-month old baby. The units have been newly refurbished, and are just beautiful, as everyone has mentioned. We have stayed here and at Marriott Grande Vista before, and I've come to like this property better...The (renovated) bar is closer to the pool, and unlike GV, the property doesn't feel overwhelming. Also, unlike GV, the laundry room is separate and the second bedroom does not have the \"lock off\" feature and its own entrance which is something that concerns me with younger kids. The pools were just beautiful and were busy, but never felt crowded. Water temperature was just perfect. The kids (14 and 4) enjoyed some of the activities, including karaoke night, and seemed to have more fun at the resort than at the theme parks nearby. Food options (Pizza Hut, Starbucks coffee, and the grill) were very good, and the Marketplace was wonderful for getting last-minute items. There have been some complaints about not having an on-site restaurant, but that just seems unfounded to me. The restaurants nearby offer limitless possibilities! The proximity to Sea World (about a mile) and other theme parks is fantastic. As a word to the wise, I would recommend going to Sea World early to avoid lines on the major rides, then leaving mid-day and returning early again a second day. No crowds from 9am til 12noon.

I was very nervous given some of the negative remarks on some of the reviews. We had an absolutely wonderful experience with no down sides at all. We were marketed by the timeshare people at the Grande Vista down the road b/c this is a timeshare resort. We had been to one other Marriott presentation and found it to be very low pressure so we booked our stay KNOWING we agreed to listen to the 90 minute presentation (It lasted exactly 110 minutes start to leaving the property, so I guess this was the down side) However, we did not buy and found our representative pleasant, low key and w/o pressure tactics. The grounds themselves are beautiful. It is lushly manicured in the Floridian way with lots of privacy, shade and a sense of quiet We checked right in no problems at all. They gave me EXACTLY the kind of room I requested, remodeled, non-smoking, quiet and away from the elevators. We were in the last building, last villa on the 4rth floor overlooking the golf course. We loaded the luggage trolley and took the elevator. From then on out we just used the stairs around the corner from our unit. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit w/screenporch and 2 person jacuzzi and full kitchen. We were in paradise. It was clean, quiet and more than I was expecting. They even have several down pillows on every bed from Pacific Coast Down. I brought our own down pillows b/c you never know what kind your get but these would have been fine if I did not bring my own. We had maid service everyday and a welcome pack with shampoo, laundry soap, dish soap and all sundries you might need. They gave us $100 in Marriott money to use for anything at the resort. I agree the Market Place prices are high but I did buy a dozen eggs, loaf of bread, 1/2 gallon of milk and stick of butter for $9.00 but that is what I fixed for breakfast for 3 days so it was worth it. They do not have any kind of real restaurant on the property but this does not bother us. They did have a bar which we did not use but I saw some funky drinks in coconuts which looked good. I suggest you just drive to the nearby Super Walmart and purchase some food and drinks since you have a full kitchen with everything you may need. We had no problem with bugs maybe b/c we did not stay near the lake and we had only a view of it from our villa however, we did fish several times at the lake and caught 15 good size bass. Everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful. They have a very nice college age man who runs the water taxi which shoots you back and forth the lake. They have beautiful pools and activites. Actually, my children loved it so much that we ditched Seaworld the second day even though we had passes that allowed 2 visits and they were not interested in the Blizzard Beach passes we had. We did go to Typhoon Lagoon and I think this was the worse part of the trip for me. Anyway, we had a wonderful vacation and would go back in a minute.

The pools were great, the 24 hr fitness room was good (only had one elyptical though), the game room was fun for the kids (air hockey), basketball courts, pool, playground...it was all fab. The Market place store is way overpriced..$4.99 USD for a 12oz box of Froot Loops. I did not eat at the grill on the grounds as there were soooooo many more restaurants on International Drive to choose from.

Even with the renovations the pools at Cypress Harbour won't be able to hold a candle to the pools at Grande Vista or Royal Palms etc. The units are a bit older than Grande Vista and even though the kitchen was refurbished (and lovely) the bathrooms need new showers, fixtures and tilework. We also had a few ant visitors when we ate near the screened porch. No trouble with bugs in the kitchen though :-) Overall, Cypress Harbour is definitely a quality place to stay in Orlando, especially if the pool scene isn't too important to you.", "Date": "March 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort\u201d", "Author": "OliviaWestSussex", "ReviewID": "UR6834347", "Content": "We travelled to the Marriott Cypress Harbour for a two week stay from the 05th-16th February.

The living area is large with a sectional sofa, large armoir with TV, and desk area (with free internet!). The dining area had a large table and 6 chairs. There was a separate utility room for the washer and dryer, which were large capacity, and with the door closed, you could hardly hear the noise. Our screened-in balcony overlooked a grassy area and was so nice for morning coffee and late-evening relaxing. The villa was very clean, and all the upholstery and linens were newer. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The bed is especially important to me, as I have back problems and need a good mattress. The daily housekeeping service was great and also complimentary. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We called the front desk from the airport at 10:30 am and were offered check in right away without any additional fees. When a DVD rented at the hotel performed poorly, we were credited with the entire rental amount without having to ask twice. There are three pool areas, but we used only the main area as we were closest to that spot. It is set to be renovated starting in January (and some of the buildings around there are already being worked on), but it didn't look like it needed any improvement at all. The only complaint is that the pool and the hot tubs could be a little warmer. Location was great! You are in an area that has 3 Marriott properties (Residence Inn and Horizons) and it is just off the major roads. We were close to Seaworld and Universal, and close enough to all the Disney parks. About the timeshare inquiries -- just as another reviewer mentioned -- don't pick up the phone or claim your \"free gift\". The phone only rang once in our 6 days, and it was a polite woman inviting us to breakfast with the offer of $200 in credits at Disney. We were not interested, and that was the only approach made to us. Website photos often flatter resort amenities and rooms, but in this case, the photos do not lie. It is a beautiful resort with great facilities. Our only regret is that because we were park-hoppers each day, we could not take advantage of the many activities scheduled at the resort. We did not even check out the new exercise club. Just for some reference for this glowing review, we have also stayed at the Sheraton Vistana Resort and the Cypress Pointe Grand Villas, both of which we liked.

This resort is close to Disney, Sea World, Animal Kingdom, etc...convenient. Also, shop at the Publix grocery store nearby (ask front desk for directions). We ADORED our time at this resort and would absolutely go back. By far the best resort for young families. Ask for a remodelled room (some rooms are newer than others in terms of decor). Elevators in all buildings makes stoller access effortless.

I traveled with my daughter, son and there friends. A total of 7 of us, three girls ranging in age from 17-18 and three boys ranging in age from 20-22. The place to me was very good, the master bedroom especially with the oversize jacuzzi and seperate shower. The living room and dining room made it very spacey. Even with young adults, there was still room . We weren't crowded at all. The staff did call me to ask about a tour of there timeshare, since I was not a member , but I told them I wasn't interested and they thank me for my time. Activities abound, three pools and always activities, basketball, tennis courts, golf course and a 9 hole mini golf.. The location of the resort makes it ideal and at night while sitting on your fenced in balcony , pure quiet. The kitchen was a little small , and maybe they could have had a couple more pots. but still it was manageable. They probably would have gave me more, but hey we didn't stay in the room all that much. One thing that I did need was a toaster , I called the front desk and told them my toaster was broken and approx. 15 minutes later ... there it was. I asked about the refurbrished rooms at check-in and I was told that the newer refurbrished rooms were dedicated to members of the Marriot. So my condo was almost in the rear of the resort facing Sea World, however it was in great shape.. Maybe a 5 minute walk from the front desk or any other place on the resort , at the most..

They took our cell number and we started out the side door to look at the pool. We literally hadn't got around the pool, when we got a call stating our room was ready. We were very grateful. They advised us we would be in building 71, on the ground floor...oh, oh I thought, here we go. Building 71 looked a long way off from all the amenities of the resort, and ground floor kinda struck me the wrong way. I shouldn't have worried. It's a short drive to the buildings, and a short walk to the island pool. The ground floor unit was great. I enjoyed being able to sit in the enclosed balcony and look at the pond in the back of the condo and the quiet was great. Inside the condo, the kitchen had everyhting you needed for a short or extended stay. The full size dishwasher, stove, and fridge were all very clean and worked great. Our unit was not renovated, but still looked very new. The second bedroom was huge, and could have easily accommodated 4 people with the hide a bed sofa. Second bathroom was very nice, with a shower and bath combo, and was very spacious. The master bedroom was huge with a lovely whirlpool tub, seperate shower stall that easily fits 2 !!!, and a large closet with safe. The pools were lovely. We used the one on the island the most. It has a sandy beach by the lake, and has lots of tropical feeling with shady places to lay, and enjoy the view. The pool by the check in area is usually more busy, and lively. They had a great steel drum player/singer there one night, and I felt like I was in the Caribbean. Nice store that was well stocked with all sorts of items, and they had a nice take out with pizza and french fries and other grill orders. Sea World literally is within walking distance, and you are minutes from Int. Drive. Note for supermarkets, there are 2 Publix close to the resort.

We stayed in a two bedroom condo in Building 66, which is nearest to the \"Island\" Pool and a short walk (5 mins) from both the activity center and the main pool and reception area. There were also convenient small playgrounds just outside as well as a barbecue. We found no bugs (perhaps due to the winter, of course) and had no complaints about the furnishings or cleanliness of our room----typical condo pastels that you'd never put in your own house but harmless enough. For what it is worth, our couch cushions matched! The room was very large and well fitted out. Plenty of utensils, cutlery and pots & pans all in an adult sized kitchen. Daily laundry service plus full sized washer & drier, so our gamble of packing light paid off. Two full baths and shower---and the master bedroom bath was an enormous jacuzzi. Other than the noise like a jet engine, having a soak at the end of a day of lugging the kids around the Magic Kingdom was a big bonus. Plenty of bedroom and convertible sofa beds so visiting grandparents and siblings were able to stay over without crowding. The outside porch went underused because the weather was typical Orlando winter of mid-60s and breezy. The pools were not quite as heated as we'd have liked given the cool days, but the multiple hot tubs nearby each very large pool made it possible to keep the shivers from setting in while the kids happily splashed around and turned blue. There was also a little sandy beach which was a nice change from poolside concrete. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially at the activity center where they took a shine to our boys. The activity center itself was a bit sleepy because we were there during off-peak, but still provided a place to explore and enough variety (basketball, ping-pong, swings, mini-golf, game room, checkers, etc.) to make return visits exciting. Group activities like egg hunts and arts and crafts were OK but suffered from the lack of a number of kids. The on-site store was very convenient for missed out supplies and a quick fix of Krispy Kremes or a Pizza Hut pizza when you've run out of ideas for what you might feed the kids.

There were always straight back chairs for my father to sit on. Building 66 was close enough for me to walk back to our unit to grab drinks and snacks. I also like the huge screened in porch, which is big enough for a table and four chairs. Cypress Harbour is so easy to find from the airport.

All of our requests had been honored. The concierge, as well as the entire staff (from housekeeping and groundskeeping to maintenance) were incredibly friendly and helpful. The concierge made all dinner reservations (including some freebees) - Emeril's (great)Wolfgang Puck (too salty & carrot cake was close to dry) Fulton's Crab House (fantastic crab cakes), Cirque, provided excellent directions for everywhere we went, and arranged for a timeshare presentation @ Horizon's across the street.

We live in Tampa and go to Orlando several times a year but this was our first stay here. We have stayed at all the Disney resorts, Sheraton Vistana, Marriott World Center, Hard Rock Universal and countless others and we have now added Cypress Harbour as one of the tops on our favorite list. I had faxed a room request with certain requirements 3 days before arriving including early check in. By the way we are renters, not owners. We arrived at 8:45 am and were told that they had us down for a villa that met all of our requirements but would not be available until 1:00 pm, but they had another villa ready immediately that met our other requirements but was not a newly refurbished one like I requested. We debated for awhile and decided to take the room that was ready. It was nice that they discussed this with us and let us make the decision. We were in the Key West building which is on the back side. Walking up to the door, yes I noticed the bugs and dirt on and around the door that others have mentioned. Upon walking into the villa I was immediately happy with the size and spaciousness, as well as its decor. Yes you could tell that the living room furniture was older, and yes the beds were worn and yes there were a couple of blades of grass or something in the huge tub and yes I saw a small corner of the shower with slight mold and yes the edge of the carpet was tattered and a small stain here and there. BUT SO WHAT! I brought a can of lysol and sprayed all the furniture down and it ended up being very comfortable to sit on. I ran some water and wiped down the bathtub. I wasn't sleeping on the front door or standing on the small mold spot in the shower or rolling around on the carpet so who cared about that. The bed is one of the few hotel beds I have not woken up with a sore back in and was actually comfortable in. All in all this room was WONDERFUL. The master bedroom is truly beautiful. The jacuzzi tub is the largest I've seen and can sit two large adults side by side easily. Although because it is so big it takes quite awhile to fill up. Besides the kings size bed there was also a chaise lounge chair, a huge armoire with TV and several drawers for clothes, two night stands and a large closet. Plus lots of walking around space. We brought an air mattress so two people would not have to sleep on the sofa sleeper in the other bedroom so my newlywed brother in law and his wife could have privacy. There was plenty of space to put the queen size mattress down plus pull out the sleeper sofa in the living room. The activities and recreational amenities were great and kept both my husband and 10 year old son entertained and happy. We didn't get to spend as much time on the grounds as we wanted because we had parks and other things on our agenda to squeeze in, plus the rain from Hurricane Dennis wouldn't of let us do anything recreational at the hotel Saturday evening anyway. We really needed a couple of extra days just to enjoy the resort and do all their activities they offer. I love the Disney resorts (especially Wilderness Lodge) and our next trip we are planning in October, I will be really torn between who to choose...a Disney deluxe resort or Cypress Harbour.

The nicely equiped kitchen had granite countertops, honey oak colored cabinets and all the appliances and gadgets you need in a full service kitchen. The great room as I call it had a large dining room, desk area and huge living area with flat screen t.v. plenty of seating and an incredible panaramic view of the lake and fountains. Just off the side of the great room was a large screened in porch with it's own incredible view! My children loved playing out there and my mother-in-law must have spent hours out there relaxing and taking in the great view. There was also a full-size laundry room with all the amenities. The 2 bedrooms and 2 baths were on opposite sides of the villa and provided great privacy. The master bedroom had a large jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and 2 sinks. The guest bedroom had it's own bath as well as a separate pull-out sofa. Both bedrooms also have televisions with remotes, 3 total inside villa. Our villa served as the gathering spot for our other relatives and friends who were visiting Orlando with us. There was plenty of room to set out food and sit around and have a nice evening. THE GROUNDS This resort seemed to have unlimited options for entertaining! There was a full children playground which my small children loved! Shuffle Board, Basketball hoops, Tennis Courts, Video Games, Boat Rentals, Bike Rentals. There was also a large boat that held maybe 35 people or so that you could jump on and take a ride around the lake. There were even platforms where you could fish in the lake, which is full of Bass fish. THE POOLS Pools everywhere! And several pools situated throughout the grounds for everyone. There were hot tubs, kiddie wade pools, water features, even a beach where my children had a great time, playing in the sand making sand castles! Incredible! THE ON-SITE AMENITIES Pizza Hut, Starbucks Coffee, Deli, Store, Poolside Bar, Poolside Snack Bar. THE LOCATION Away from all the chinsy looking storefronts and fast food restaurants.

There were lots of activities for those who were interested, and for those who aren't, lots of places to relax. There was a lake which boasted Bass fishing, but i was skeptical till i saw some decent sized fish swimming around (have to guess at about 2 pounds). There are 3 pool areas, 2 of which had a kiddie pool section and 2 saunas/whirlpools and one had a dry sauna that i found on the last day. The 3rd pool area located at the activity center I never got a look at but the activity center had lots to do as well. B-Ball Courts, pool tables, playground, game room, so-so mini putt, Card tables and board games inside. There were also BBQ's spread out all over the resort, gas and coals, although the resort needs to have more gas ones ( 1st come 1st serve, 3 of us in the rain, figure it out) If you need to go to the parks, Sea world was basically down the block, Disney was 5 minutes of highway, Universal was 10 minutes on I drive. On rainy days you can rent DVD's in the lobby (DO NOT GO TO THE OUTLETS WITH THE REST OF THE TOURISTS!!!!!!!). They have shows/singers throughout the week in different locations in the resort. A nice thing they have for those with kids 5 and up is Kids Nite Out. You drop them off at about 5, you get a beeper, they feed them and entertain them, you pick them up at 10 after have a nice dinner.( I HIGHLY recommend FishBones located at Sandlake road and International Drive......EXCELLENT FOOD) All in all everyone was impressed and would definitely go back and recommend to others.

I stayed for five nights in March 2005 with my wife, our two kids and my parents. Our extremely attractive two-bedroom villa was more than spacious enough for all six of us. Overall, the villa exceeded my expectations in all respects, from the construction quality to the care taken to stock the kitchen with small essentials like paper towels and dishwashing liquid. The resort's amenities and activities also greatly exceeded my expectations. Because there's so many fun activities to do at the resort, my kids (ages 7 and 4) enjoyed hanging out at the resort as much if not more than visiting the theme parks. The resort is sparkling clean, well maintained and beautifully landscaped. (The photos on the resort's Web site fall short of conveying the property's overall attractiveness.) The only minor negative about our entire experience is that some of the living room furniture in our villa was very, very slightly frayed. But I've stayed at four other places in Orlando over the past three years, including the Ritz Carlton and at a four-star Disney resort. Marriott's Cypress Harbour is definitely my favorite.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Shore, MA", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable place to stay\u201d", "Author": "BOS_TO_MCO", "ReviewID": "UR3194303", "Content": "We stayed at the Cypress Harbour from 16 January thru 23 January 2005 and very much enjoyed our time there. The following things left us with this impression: 1) Staff at the security checkpoint - Friendly, helpful and courteous. Made you feel welcome, while reassuring us that not just anyone could come into the grounds of the resort. 2) Front desk personnel - Friendly, helpful, and fast. Check-In and check-out were a breeze and times when we had to talk with the desk for help they always provided it with a smile. 3) The Villas - Spacious, comfortable and clean. The villas are all 2-bedroom units with screened in balconies that have a patio set on them if you choose to sit outside and enjoy the view. Master bedroom has plenty of storage, a large, round jacuzzi tub, walk in shower and double sink. The king-size bed was very comfortable. My only wish was that the TV was slightly larger. The second bedroom was smaller, with a queen-sized bed. The was a pullout sofa in here, as well as a TV. There was a separate bathroom for this bedroom. The living roomwas bright and comfortable, with a puullout sofa as well. There was a desk with an internet connection and a TV in the room as well, with several HBO channels (HBO on the other TV's as well). The kitchen provided everything we needed. I like the advantage of being able to cook and eat-in if we choose to, rather than go out every night. I also like being able to make my own coffee in the morning in a real coffee maker, as I have yet to find a place in the area where I can get a really good cup of coffee. Nice to have the fridge too, for snacks, O.J., cream, etc. 4) The resort layout - A fairly large resort, I thought that the grounds were nicely landscaped and attractive. Despite last Fall's hurricane season, everything was well-groomed. I thought that the boardwalk across from the lobby area to the opposite side of the complex was an attractive and functional way to link the grounds, and the water shuttle that was available to bring you from the lobby building to the watersports area is another nice touch. The pools looked great, but the day of our arrival temperatures started dropping from the 80's to the 50's. Needless to say, we didn't break out the suits at all. 5) Location - The location off of Westwood Blvd. puts you just around the corner from Seaworld and a pretty short drive to either Disney or Universal. I found it easy to travel to any of the destinations that I was looking to get to. Overall - We experienced no negatives at this resort. We found everything we needed, were very comfortable and loved the views, grounds and access to the many things available in the Orlando / Kissimmee area. We've always had great luck with the Marriott properties and this was yet another positive experience. Iwould not hesitate to stay here again and would highly recommend this resort.", "Date": "February 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCypress Harbour is like home !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3176748", "Content": "We have stayed at some great resorts and some bad resorts and Cypress Harbour definitely falls into the \"great resort\" category ! We have stayed at Cypress Harbour for the past 5 years and this year we thought we might try the new Marriott Horizons across the street for our January vacation this year (see my review on Horizon's). Horizons was just \"OK\" but a bit of a disapointment. At the end of our week at Horizons we were stranded because of a big NE snowstorm which affected our flights out. We decided to stay the 3 extra nights at Cypress Harbour and this made all the difference ! it was like returning home for us. Cypress Harbour is a real resort not just a hotel. It has more amenities than you could ever use in a week. There are 3 pools; one out on an island that is so romantic and luxurious that it has to be seen to be appreciated. I lost count of the hot tubs 7-9 maybe...we keep discovering more each year as we walk around. There are several playgounds for the kids, recreation room, basketball, tennis, and a great game room (not arcade but a real game room with chess, checkers, card tables, board games etc..). There are kiddie pools, boat rentals on their own lake, and even a new mini-golf. They have a full time recreation staff there and something was scheduled for every hour. My kids loved the tie dyed t-shirts and we had a ball with the make your own ice cream sundaes. The staff members are so friendly and helpful there. The friendliness at Cypress just seems to be a natural and genuine thing for them. With a fullly stocked marketplace, gift shop, sandwhich deli and a Pizza Hut that delivers to your room, we never had to leave the resort. As like all Marriotts the rooms give you everything; full kitchens, laundry in the room, irons, hair dryers, appliances, tv's in all the rooms, it goes on and on. The rooms are undergoing a complete face lift. Because of our last minutes reservation they gave us an old room but still this was spacious and at a level of luxury that my family appreciates. We snuck into one room that the workers were redcorating and all I can say is \"WOW\" ! It was a wonderful 3 days being stranded at Cypress Harbour. We were foolish to go to Horizons. Cypress Harbour will always be \"our place\" from now on...I am booking our January 2006 vacation at Cypress Harbour now!", "Date": "February 10, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marriott's Cypress Harbour", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d85383-Reviews-Marriott_s_Cypress_Harbour-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$233 - $404*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">11251 Harbour Villa Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32821</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "85383", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/a4/e4/9b/live-oaks-grace-our-resort.jpg"}}

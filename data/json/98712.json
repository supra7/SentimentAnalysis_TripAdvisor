{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Reserved a week, left after first night! I checked the reviews before reserving this place, but I did not heed the warnings. I am a bargain hunter and I reserved a week for a business stay. I left as quickly as possible after the first night. I've stayed in hotels in third world east European countries. This place was worse!I got into my first room (you'll notice that multiple room changes are a regular occurance here). The fridge didn't work and I had to repack, go to the front desk, and request a new room. I got into my second room. Here's a quick list of the problems: 1. Carpet was disgusting. I spent a lot of time the first night trying to guess what the huge stains were on the carpet. I wonder if that place was a crime scene at one point?2. This was a non-smoking room, but that didn't deter cigarette burn holes on all the furniture and throughout the room. I couldn't sit on the couch. It was too nasty.3. The rest of the furniture in the room made my college apartment look luxurious. 4. The dishwasher didn't work and there was garbage in it from where other people have tried to use it (obviously maintenence is not a priority for these folks). 5. The room smelled (see other reviews). 6. The iron had black (something?) on it and the iron board had only one leg. I tried to use one of the shoddy chairs to balance it while I ruined a good shirt with the blackening iron. 7. There was no handle on the tub to switch to shower, so I tried to take a bath.8. Hot water lasted about 2 minutes (honestly). My bath was very short. 9. While sitting in one-inch deep tepid water in the tub, I saw black (something) smeared all over the side of the not-so-clean toilet. 10. The heat lamp in the bathroom was a 60-watt regular light bulb.11. But there's always tv, right? WRONG! The cable on both sets was completely jacked and the reception was so fuzzy I couldn't even watch it. 12. It was either 100 degrees or 20 below. 13. The carpet was ripped in several places. Trust me, if you're going to trip and fall on your face, you at least would like to have decent flooring to fall on. 14. The coffee maker didn't have a lid and wouldn't work. That was a blessing since I found the water holder in it to be completely mouldy. 15. They told me this was a full breakfast. I still can't find anything on google about what red-colored jelly substance scrambled eggs can be cooked in. and the winner is......16. When I demanded to check out the next day due to these and other numerous problems, they told me I would have to pay for 2 nights instead of the only one I stayed. What a rip off!Seriously folks.. this place is not just older or run-down. It's a DUMP! And I'm not being a wimp... I'm a cop, and am used to being a bit tough. This fact about me came in handy as I noticed the crack deal in the parking lot as I left.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR911036555", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "tbgalileo"}, {"Content": "not bad at all!

Stayed in this hotel for 3 days before renting an apartment. It was my worst stay ever.At first, the receptionist showed me a room which smelled badly. Then another one which is not cleaned. At last I moved into the third room which was somewhat ok (Maybe when compared to the previous rooms I had seen). The bedspread and quilt were torn at many places. The bath pipes doesn't work properly. Water won't come in shower. Shower curtain is too lengthy that you have to stand on it while bathing. The water in the bathtub will take minimum 15 minutes to empty when you try to shower. Let me come to the story outside the room. You could see people standing on the road inside the inn and drinking beer and chatting in the night. You will never know when your car will be stolen. The management doesn't care.They remodelled some old apartment into this suite. You don't see quality people staying here. The room stinks (I really mean it...always some damp smell in the room). The housekeeping don't know english (U could escape if you know spanish). I think many people here stay for monthly basis. You see someone always outside the room chatting, smoking as if you had come to a gang area. Strangers ask for smoke when you are outside the room. I never felt safe here and immediatly vacated after 3 days and moved to a different area.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR886399097", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "SRSASR"}, {"Content": "Worst place I have ever stayed at in my 40 years of life Please Please avoid this place.The first room we were put in smelt so horrible.I could taste the smell even when I plugged my nose.My husband had a allergic attack and I almost threw up.They moved us to another rm.Smelt stale but not like the first rm.Pull out sofa had no mattress left.All springs.Back door had no deadbolt.My childrens feet had to be washed because they got so black from the floor.The worst we were going to bed a huge cockroach ran across my sons face in the bed.We fled the hotel AT 1:00AM.I have never in all my year's seen such a place.Not even when I have paid much less a night.The girl at the front desk was nice.That is the only good thing I can say about this horrible scary place.Please don't let the pictures on the internet fool you.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR295255934", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MKarl"}, {"Content": "Horrible does not begin to describe this \u9225\u699fotel\u9225?! Review for Quality Suites13636 Goldmark Dr. Dallas, TxDo NOT stay here!!!(Sorry in advance that this is so long, but I feel you really must read!)We had reservations to stay at this hotel because I had to go to Dallas for medical test.I did my first round of test and we went to the hotel to check in. My friend went in, checked us in and off we went to our room. We were supposed to have a Smoking King Room with Sleeper sofa.I did not go in the first time, because it is difficult for me to walk. So of course our room was (in building 11) upstairs. We opened the door to our room and there was a massive stench. But we proceeded on to check it out. We found:- There were stains all over the carpet, - Burn marks, - A metal vent covering in the bathroom that was just hanging down loose. That could have seriously hurt someone since the ceiling was slanted and it hung down so low. I\u9225\u6a93 short, but it could have hit me in the head.- Some of the lights came on, some did not. - Most of the electrical outlets did not have any covers on them. (We did finally find the source of the stench. There was standing, moldy water in the dishwasher. Along with dirty dishes). - There was not a working lock on the door. Not even a safety lock up top that every hotel on earth has. - No ashtrays in a smoking room. - NO bedding for the foldout sofa.I called the front desk and got a man. I told him some of the issues in the room; he said he would send someone up right away. After waiting for quite some time, with no one showing up\u9225?I called back. This time I got a personality impaired young girl. She said \u9225\u6dda\u9225\u6a93 talking to a customer, call back\u9225? And hung up on me. Well what am I? I called back about 5 minutes later and she said, \u9225\u6dd7ow did you get in that room?\u9225?I told her we checked in about an hour ago. \u9225\u6deahe said, \u9225\u6dda don\u9225\u6a9b know how you got in that room. If you want to talk to me come down to the desk.\u9225?I told her that is why I was calling\u9225?it\u9225\u6a9a hard for me to walk all over the complex. She said, \u9225\u6ddaf you have something to say come down here. I don\u9225\u6a9b know why you are in that room!!!\u9225? And hung up on me..again!We hobbled down to the front desk. Which was not easy. Explained everything to Miss. Personality. She did try to defend the room. And tell me that it was ok. Which it was NOT. I was not a happy customer at this point. A man showed up behind the counter and told her to cancel someone else\u9225\u6a9a reservations and give us that room. I asked if it was smoking. They said yes. And it\u9225\u6a9a a King room, correct? Yes, yes it is. It was on the other side of the complex in building 17. I explained to them again how hard it was to walk up and down the stairs. And all over the complex. Their attitude was \u9225\u69a6h well\u9225? No help with luggage \u9225?nothing.So we had to walk back to our building, up a flight of stairs, get our luggage, walk back down the stairs, load everything back up in the car, drive to building 17, unload everything again, walk back up another flight of stairs to finally get to the second room.This room looked like someone had kicked the door in at some point. The molding around the door was half way tacked back on. There was a gap in the door, so you could see in the room from the hallway.Being gluttons for punishment \u9225?we proceeded on to the room. This room was much smaller. It did have a sofa \u9225?that was broken! The cushions would not even fit on it anymore. And it had that\u9225? \u9225\u6967irty upholstery feel to it. - This carpet was worse than the first room. Didn\u9225\u6a9b know that could be possible. But it was.- There was NO kitchen. After assuring us there would be. - The refrigerator was broken. (Which was all we had. No microwave\u9225\ue6d4othing else)- Same deal with the electrical outlets. Most did not have a cover on them. - There was a huge gap in the floor going out to the balcony. If you had a Chihuahua it could have gone through this gap under the door without a problem.- The nails were all coming up on the balcony. Neither of us tempted fate to step out onto it. I\u9225\u6a93 quite certain it would not have held us up!- There was again, NO lock on the balcony door. None.- There was NOT a king bed. Not even a queen. It was a full size bed \u9225?with one tiny little pillow. Like a throw pillow. Maybe one foot by one foot. With NO pillow case. - And the air-conditioning was broken.- NO bible in either room. Not a big deal to some, but we found it odd.So, I again called the front desk. I got Mrs. Personality again who told us to come to the front desk. I told her that was not happening\u9225?and the problems with the room.I was told that we could not get another pillow because each room has a pillow and that is all that they have. Pretty much deal with it. No pillow case. No extra pillow. That is just how the room is. Come to the front desk and they would see what else they had.We really didn\u9225\u6a9b need to talk about it anymore. I was beyond irritate at this point. I told her never mind. We would look for another hotel. And do NOT charge us for this room. This was ridiculous. The manager was there and told her to tell me that he would give me $5 (Five dollars) off of the room if we would stay! Haha. I would not have stayed at that point if he had paid for the room! They assured us that we would not be charged.It was nasty, filthy, serious personality issues with the \u9225\u69aetaff\u9225?and basically NOT a safe place to stay. So called hot tub packed with leaves and debris. Pool was.. not something I felt safe in testing without a medic close at hand. I have been all over the world. I have stayed in some pretty odd places in third-world countries \u9225?they were by far much better than this place! Even in Belize (before it became a big tourist attraction) had some pretty strange places to stay. But they were clean. And they were at least friendly. This place needs to be shut down. We did go on to find a really nice room for only $10 more at Best Western Suites \u9225?Addison. Which I don\u9225\u6a9b care how much more it was. It was worth every penny!They had a wonderful happy hour. Wonderful. Very nice staff, everything was just amazing. They made you feel like you were staying in a 4-star hotel. I would highly recommend it!!After getting back home, we found out that they did charge our credit card for the room. But would release the funds. Which will take several weeks. I called the 800 number for the chain and complained. I was told that they could not refund the money, nor pay for us having to move, no compensation at all because each hotel was individually owned. So it was up to that owner to decide what to do. Want to guess what this owner has done? ** there was a sign by the pool that said \u9225\u6de7lease shower before entering\u9225?br/>I have never seen that before. You know it had to be a problem at some point for them to put this huge sign up!", "Date": "Aug 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR276100963", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "jodimm"}, {"Content": "Rude people and no longer owned by Best Western Now Luxery Suites, owned by foriengers that are rude and refuse to give rates over the phone, will tell you when you get there.

To say this is a three star suite hotel would be stretching the truth to almost breaking. The three star rating was from the web site I booked my stay. When I checked in on April 4th the person behind the desk did not go over any of the amnities they had or where anything was except how to get to my room. The suites are older converted apartments or condos. They are very roomy and have a lot of closet space also the bathroom has a lot of cabinet space. These are pretty much the only positive things about the suites themselves. The room at first glance did look clean but when you looked a little bit harder you could see old spider webs and new ones. Also the bed spead on the bed had blood stains. The kitchen did have a microwave like was listed but it was from the ealier 80's and I was afraid to use it since it was almost as old as me. The hi speed access is WiFI so if you do not have wireless access on your computer you can use the dial up access available.

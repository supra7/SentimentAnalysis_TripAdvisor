I typically stay at 2 or 3 star hotels... This hotel doesnt even deserve a 1 star. As soon as I went to check in I got a creepy feeling. I felt disgusted and frightened (though I cant really explain it.) When we showed up in the room, we noticed that the room definitely looked outdated, which in and of itself wouldnt upset me. But then we noticed that there were nasty stains on the comforters. Then when we lifted that up, the next blanket was not only stained but it had several cigarette burn holes in it. (This was on both beds). There was a huge hole in the wall right next to the 2nd bed. Then the bathroom light barely came in. Seeing the blankets was the icing on the cake though. My husband went to the manager to ask for new blankets but he was rudely told that they didnt have an additional clean comforters, and then he made a quick call which stated that they had one blanket... (even though we had two beds.) When asked if they had another room, the manager claimed that they were fully booked and had no where for us to go. When my husband returned to the room, the family in the room next to us said their room was disgusting also, and that they even had blood stains on the wall. (The room 2 days down stated the same thing.) I refused to stay there and began calling around to other places, while talking to expedia to get them to cancel my reservation. Expedia then called the hotel, and the manager then stated that he had another room to move us to. (Even though he stated 5 mins early that he did not!) We refused and ended up having to stay at a hotel 30 mins away. (It was spring break week this past week and all the nearby hotels were fairly booked.) Considering my first night there (after $15 hotel fee per day) cost $75, it was definitely not worth it.

Since I was traveling alone I just used the other blanket on the bed. The next morning I went for breakfast, which was just doughnut holes and orange juice. I informed the front desk of the two issues and asked that they be resolved. I didn't use the shuttle at all during my stay because they only pick up early in the morning and then drop off at night- I didn't want to be stuck at the parks in case something happened. When I arrived back at my hotel the beds were made but the blanket was still there, and the safe was still not working. I figured oh well. The rest of the stay was pleasant enough except I was frightened one night when a nearby delivery restaurant forced a menu through the door. When I was going to check out I grabbed my milk from the refrigerator and realized that it had gone bad. The refrigerator was broke and the only thing that had saved me from food poisoning the previous two days was the frozen blue ice I had placed in there. When I checked out I told the hotel staff about the refrigerator. I got a callus, \"oh well it broke we will fix it.\" I didn't expect anything but still an apology would have been nice. I was a little frustrated with the hotel because I was charged a resort fee that included the safe and refrigerator and neither worked. This is a good hotel for people on a budget and if you plan on staying in the parks all day. But be warned you will have to pay the Disney parking fee if you don\u2019t want to wake up to catch the shuttle before 8 and then leave the park at 10 (Which is impossible since the fireworks at every park is around 9 and goes \u2018till 9:30 and the mad rush to get out after is impossible to navigate through). I would recommend this hotel to couples without children, since the shuttle would be hard to catch and you would have to drive with your family and the parking fee would just be a pain for any family.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSolid base for visiting the parks, not bad (June 2010)\u201d", "Author": "AndrewWaters_England", "ReviewID": "UR75002612", "Content": "A really good base for visiting the parks and excellent value.

The only downside was that on the last day the computers broke down for some reason and they therefore lost all of the information about who was staying where, this resulted in them sending a large family into our room at 3am (fortunately I had put the latch across!) but it wasn't a massive problem and they apologised profusely in the morning.

It gave us what we paid for. Rooms : Although the rooms are old and would need a facelift, it was clean, safe and decent. We had two double-beds with a full bathroom, a little table, two chairs, a safe, a telephone, a TV with full cable as well as a little fridge and microwave. We really can\u2019t ask for much more at $30/night. The towels are old and scratchy a little, so I\u2019d suggest bringing your own towels/face clothes. You will also need to bring your own shampoo/soap as they provide very little. Then again, it\u2019s to be expected at the cheap price we pay. Although loud at times, the AC was working well and kept us cool. My only concern would be the water. I\u2019m not sure if there is something bad with the water in the Orlando/Kissimmee area, but it has a really strong smell\u2026 So much that I had to use bottled water to brush my teeth. Again, it\u2019s bearable if you spend minimal time in your room. Internet : They say you have free wireless Internet access\u2026 and you do, but the router is not very good. We were given a room a few doors down the Lobby and we still could not get enough reception to get online. Although, when my boyfriend sat in the lobby, he had full reception. So if you want to keep your internet access to a bare minimum, it is POSSIBLE to have access but only from the lobby. If you\u2019re planning on working online for hours, forget about it. They don\u2019t have any work station open to the public either. You need to bring your own laptop/Iphone. Amendeties : There is a small pool and although I haven\u2019t been in it, there was almost always someone in it, so I figure it was alright. The \u201cfree continental breakfast\u201d they advertise is lame. Two timbits (one-bite donuts) per person is the limit and they\u2019re cheap, stale ones from the grocery store. The juice is watered down and I haven\u2019t tried their coffee. This did not bother us as the location was great and was surrounded by many restaurants, at different prices. We asked where them where their Ice Machines were and they told us to go get our ice at the Ramada Inn beside our Hotel\u2026 Don\u2019t expect to get any free Ice at Knights Inn! Location : It is greatly located with lots of restaurants around. Local bus service is available right in front of the hotel, there\u2019s a grocery store across the street, a bunch of souvenir shops, etc. For the restaurants, at less than 5 minutes walk, there is a Sizzler\u2019s, Ponderosa and a Perkins. Sizzlers and Ponderosa\u2019s offer $3,99 breakfast buffet which were both ok, but a little more greasy than what I am used to in Canada. If you want to walk a little further, you get to all the different fast food restaurants, (McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s), pizza chains (cici\u2019s, etc) and Golden Coral. There is also a few activities available at a walking distance, such as mini-putt. Shuttles : We mainly picked this hotel because of its cheap price but also because of the free shuttles to Universal Studios and Disney World. We did not have a car, so this point was extremely important to us. At this time of the year, they had two different scheduled time for shuttles to Disney world and four different return times; Which gives you to options to sleep-in in the morning or not; come back before, or after dinner, at night. For Universal, they only had one shuttle to go and come back every day but since this park is smaller, it was all we needed. Based on 7 days of using the shuttles, I can confirm that the shuttles usually ran on time, with the exception of one night when the shuttle was about 40 minutes late to bring us back to our hotel. Be ready to stand on the bus though as we rarely got seats to sit on. They pack the shuttles as packed as they can. Overall, considering the price and what we got, I think it was totally worth it and we would definitely recommend it to young couples/families on a budget who simply want a place to stay over night without spending much time in the room. If you\u2019re planning on spending a lot of free time in the room or work at night, I suggest going somewhere else.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cit's good for the price\u201d", "Author": "Marcelociocca", "ReviewID": "UR31027737", "Content": "I liked the hotel because it's near disney world and we didn't stay a lot of time in the hotel, we just go there to sleep.

Shuttle: The shuttle, though it made about 20-minutes-worth of stops at other hotels, got us to Disney right when it opened, so no complaints there.

Add the $11/day Disney parking fee to the hotel room fee and it is still a good buy if you are not looking for anything at all upscale. It was an okay place to sleep at night while visiting Disney. Don't expect a lot, but it is great value for the money. Rooms have refrigerator (took 3 calls to get one that was sort of working) and microwaves.

The motel is one of the classic (original) Knights Inn designed properties, where you can park at your front door (a plus for us). When I originally booked the motel, I was able to book a room with 2 queen beds for about $50/night during Spring Break. After arriving and checking into our room, we found that there was only 1 bed. After discussing with the front desk, we discovered that the 2nd bed was folded into a cabinet along the wall. When you open the bed out, you cannot get to the bathroom from the first bed without crawling over the 2nd bed. So we opted to change rooms for 2 double beds to avoid the climbing hassle, although I do prefer queen beds. The condition of the room and furniture seemed old and covered over by paint. I stayed in Knights Inns in their beginning days, and this was not the original color of the rooms then. There was a refrigerator and microwave though, which I have not always seen in classic Knights Inn properties. The motel also offered a free continental breakfast, which we never tried due to not getting up early enough. There was also an outdoor pool, but it always seemed to be full of foreign teenagers. We did not have time to try it, due to being at Disney everyday. Here are the pluses: 1. Close to Walt Disney World 2. Very reasonable price per night 3. Park at your door Here the minuses: 1. Not very clean - Needs a quality renovation, not just paint 2. Could hear people in adjacent room when their kids were loud 3. Owner and staff usually were foreigners, who were not always very friendly/polite 4. Awakened on first morning by ticket seller, via phone, from the motel lobby. The motel gives your name and room number to them to try to get you to buy attraction tickets from them. I thought this was very rude. My final take on this motel is that if you need a low cost place to stay close to Walt Disney World, and don't mind a little uncleanliness, this may be the place for you. Personally, I would pay a bit more for a nicer hotel, but have heard that you have to be very careful because a lot of motels/hotels outside of the Disney properties have problems.

As a result, we did not arrive in time to claim our reservation and were turned away at 11 p.m. We were driving along Hwy 192 and saw the Knights Inn Maingate's lighted marquee advertising a weekly rate, so we turned in there and were warmly greeted by Cindy who was working reception. After being not-so-nicely turned away from the other hotel, Cindy's kindness was very much appreciated. Cindy explained the savings that the weekly rate offered and we decided to stay there. Both my friend and I are retired and on a budget, so we have stayed at a number of different reasonably-priced hotels in the Kissimmee area over the years.

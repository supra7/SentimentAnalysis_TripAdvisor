I went out to East Mesa to play basketball 2 mornings and it was only a couple minutes to get on the 202 so I felt like it was easy to get places.

Very nice courtyard, unique. I didn't use the pool but it looked large and very clean.

Most of the room looked recently renovated--new carpet fresh paint. Bed linen was clean, pillows were good. The so-so--microwave was ancient and noisy, the bathroom was adequate but outdated. 2nd room off street rooms were quiet enough which is what i had, but could see that street rooms or courtyard rooms by pool could be noisier. Lugging suitcases up the stairs was a drag--never did now where the elevator was. The not so good--the parking area is in back and a little creepy for a single woman--twice there was someone (probably staff) sitting in a vehicle when I pulled up. Other reviewers were correct that anyone off the street could be walking back there. Could be a lot better lit also. Also, the TV channel selection was very subpar--no local channel for news/weather--very bizarre. Instead lots of cartoons, comedy and MTV... Overall, this is good value for price and if not travelling alone I wouldn't hesitate to stay here--would consider even if I was alone again as nothing out of the ordinary happened, just that not the best set up on the parking area.

After checking in I was told the city was turning off the water from midnite to 4 am. \" No problem\" I said \"We're tired and all we want to do is sleep, we have an early flight out\" Boy, was I wrong. The one GREAT thing, is the crib was already set up for us in the room. It was rather scary driving around to the back where our room was, with no gates or other security to prevent people wandering in and out of the complex. The parking lot was deserted. Once lights were out, there was some loud music coming from some room that kept me up until 11 PM, and then again woke me before 4am. I didn't call to complain because I didn't want to wake anyone else up who had managed to fall asleep. We were planning to take the airport shuttle and leave our car, but I was thrilled to see it still there in the morning, let alone leave it unattended for 4 days. After our return, I received an email asking for feedback. I relayed all of my concerns to them and , of course, they \"do have security\" and \"I should have called\" so basically it was my fault our stay was bad. Oh, and the baby woke up with a bug in his hair, but that was because of their \"courtyard setting\" (dried up grass with a non-operational fountain) But they did offer me $5 off my next (no way) stay.

Based on several friends recommending the La Quinta chain, I chose this one, which was near our friend's house. From the description on the website, it fit our budget and had the amenities we were looking for, so we figured it would be a good place to stay. I booked the room by calling the hotel directly and actually got a better price than what I'd found at various travel websites. The woman who took my reservation was friendly and helpful. And when we arrived there in person, we got an even *better* rate. Indeed it worked out for us well. The lobby is nice and welcoming, the hotel is in an area that has convenient shopping nearby, and our room had several 'extras' that made staying there nice. It's not an ultra swanky gourmet hotel, nor is it a scary fleabag hotel. It's a nice, standard, middle ground place, which felt clean, welcoming and affordable. In our room, which had two double beds, was a little fridge, a microwave, a coffee maker with coffee & supplies provided, and a nice large closet. I liked the fact that the hotel gives you the option of not having your bed linens washed daily, if you so choose, in order to save water. The bathroom seemed standard enough. The usual soaps and tiny shampoos were supplied, and basic towels. Though we never used the microwave, it was nice to know we *could* have used it if we needed it, and we did use the fridge and the coffeemaker. I have to say though, bring your own coffee if you care at all about what your coffee tastes like. This coffee just didn't cut it for us. This is because we like to drink really, really good coffee. Still, though, it was nice to have. The beds were ok, but not the best--they were a bit slanty. But they were comfortable enough. I think all of us wished we'd brought our own pillows, too, but we're picky pillow people. The pillows supplied ranged from really flat to somewhat poofy, so if you're particular, you may want to bring your own. Other perks included the outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi tub. We *definitely* made use of that jacuzzi both nights we were there, and it really made our stay. It was one reason we chose that place--we wanted a place with a jacuzzi. It was large and clean. We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. There was also a workout room, but according to my friends who used it, it wasn't the greatest. The treadmill seemed old and cranky. The free continental breakfast was nice--especially because you can make your own fresh waffles. There are two waffle irons and premixed batter and someone standing there to help if you don't know how to work the iron. They were quite nice. Also provided are fresh fruits, cereals, packaged muffins and pastries, breads for toast, juices (from a machine, but ok enough), and the aforementioned weak coffee. A decent continental breakfast indeed; I've stayed at places with really shabby ones compared to this.

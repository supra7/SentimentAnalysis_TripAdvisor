ANYWAY- I am not understanding what the negative reviews regarding the continental breakfast are. Continential insinuates that it will be a light breakfast will be made available - if they were offering made to order meals, I am sure they would refer to it as a breakfast kitchen and not refer to it as continental. All griping aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the crockpot oatmeal with a plethera of topping options, the variety of breakfast breads and fruits, the jam selections were fantastic and have left me obsessed with guava jam. There also gave the option of making your own eggo waffles, which was nice if you werent feeling particularly experimental with anything. The view from the breakfast balcony is second to none. Listening to the light wind rustling through the trees in the mountain while watching the thick fog slowly lift off of the bay was just a fantastic way to spend waking up in the morning. Moving along, the rooms were beautifully remodeled and very convenient with the kitchenette built in to every room with a fully stocked kitchen including all cooking and eating utensils. The beds were soft and comfortable, the A/C in our room kept inside nice and chilled away from the humid, high temperatures out. They were clean and classy; the remodel was done tastefully and appealing without being overbearing on the designer's individual taste. Another random sidenote: I only noticed one cat throughout my stay. The neighborhood the resort is in is nothing fancy, there is no hiding that. It is a working class neighborhood and you really must consider this people - they are minimalists and are not a materialistic people. They are good people, kind and friendly and will never be of any threat to any traveler. This area is far off the beaten tourist path - it is \"real\" Hawaii, not a tourist postcard. I could go on and on about this resort, but I will leave some fun experience to you the traveler. I will leave you saying that I did not want to leave this Paradise and I am already checking my calendar to see when I can return!", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cLiked it somewhat but too many glitches\u201d", "Author": "Elliot254", "ReviewID": "UR138380867", "Content": "Dates stayed: 8/14/2012 to 8/18/2012 Room type: One bedroom suite on Kaneohe Bay. My wife and I wanted to stay in a nice quiet place on the windward side of the island. Because of the mixed reviews we figured give it a try for 4 nights. The best way to describe this resort is an inexpensive condo/motel built right on Kaneohe Bay in a local neighborhood fishing village. Part of the local feeling means you experience everything good and bad in the neighborhood. Stray cats are numerous perhaps because the neighbors have lots of stuff lying around. A guy in uniform walked up to the coffee pot, filled his mug, and left, so part of this experience is you are integrated into the neighborhood. The setting is definitely beautiful with the mountains in the background and gentle waves. However even as the staff was very courteous and helpful, the feeling of the inexpensive condo/motel showed through. I'll explain below. We were very disappointed by the breakfast. They called this a \"continental breakfast\". It felt like everything they had out was purchased in bulk at Costco including the plastic silverware and plates. The pineapple was excellent and in season, but the papaya was bitter and underripe. The choices were also inconsistent; one day the oranges disappeared so I asked Napua what happened. She went into the office to ask someone and didn't come out for 10 minutes so I gave up. The oatmeal was the cheap instant oatmeal quite unlike what you'd expect from a good home cooked breakfast. All of the other items were just ordinary store bought breads and pastries. I've been at many B&Bs, and they always add a personal touch with some special cooked items but there was none of this here. Since we had the one bedroom suite, we ended up just taking a few items back to our room - the better fruit and some coffee. My wife tells me the coffee was mediocre - isn't Hawaii supposed to be famous for good coffee? I can't understand the deal with the papaya because we purchased this on our own and it was very sweet unlike the papaya they served at the breakfast here. Our one bedroom suite was recently renovated and when we were there, other rooms were also being renovated. The room was definitely clean. It was a lifesaver to have a fully equipped kitchen because of the lack of a decent breakfast - my wife and I like eating full hearty breakfast on vacation :). There are still some things lacking though. The main thing that bothered us is the fridge was old and clunky, making a popping noise every 15-20 minutes. This combined with the poor building sound insulation made for some restless sleeping. A note for guests wandering around the resort at 5:30-6:00AM in the morning that your conversations, laughing, arguing, etc. can be clearly heard. The AC is similarly loud and old but fortunately with the ocean breezes it isn't needed at night. The shower curtain rings pop off every time you close the shower curtain making even the basic showering a bit of a challenge. The dresser for putting clothing has no rails which makes it difficult to use. The microwave was placed on top of the fridge because of a lack of counter space; would have been much better to have a built-in because the kitchen is a bit small. The walkway to the villa was poorly lit and probably treacherous for someone elderly. Upon checking in we went down a really steep driveway to get to our room. The spaces were limited and often full, and it was a big challenge getting in and out of that lot. I ended up crunching my bumper trying to navigate between cars and getting up the steep driveway. The resort itself is very small. The swimming pool is barely big enough to jump in and cool off. But I did get to enjoy canoeing in the large bay. It's very peaceful and relaxing and free for resort guests. If you want to try this make sure you're in good shape before you go out because it can be a bit of a workout when you row against the current. The resort also had stand up paddle boards available for a fee which I didn't get to try, but I imagine that would be fun especially when the waves are bigger in the winter. The service there was actually very warm and inviting. They always had great suggestions for things to do in the area and loved to tell stories. I do remember Napua and Kaylee who were very helpful in welcoming us to the resort and giving us suggestions of things to do. If the breakfast were better this would have been a true B&B experience ;). Things weren't so smooth when we first got there after a 14 hour flight; Napua told us \"check-in isn't until 3PM\" but after I explained that Tom told us they would try to make the room available if possible, she made up for it by getting housekeeping on it and walking down to our room with us to see if we needed anything. A nice touch for sure. When we stayed there, someone rented out the resort for a wedding. Normally that wouldn't be a problem but since the resort is so small, it really detracted from the experience. The wedding took over the entire parking lot and barbecue area so we all had to fight for parking spaces on the upper level. Shame on the management for not letting guests know until we were actually staying there and had no other options. Hopefully in my review I've painted a clear picture of what it's like to stay here. I really tried to have an open mind about this and have stayed in everything from one star basic motels to 5+ star hotels and resorts worldwide. While the Paradise Bay Resort is beautiful and relaxing, and the staff is very welcoming, the subpar breakfast, resort, & room facilities, and especially the nuisance of a wedding taking over the resort made this a real mixed bag experience and definitely not worth paying the 4-5 star resort price. This really doesn't provide the great \"alternative to Waikiki\" that it should be providing.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLove it like my second home!\u201d", "Author": "Jennftb", "ReviewID": "UR137580355", "Content": "I can't say enough nice things about Paradise Bay Resort.

The location of the hotel was just breathtaking. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We stayed in connecting units 15, 16, 17 if i remember correctly. The large unit (#16) was beautiful and spacious but fell short because of how it was furnished. I felt the furniture was too small for the size of the room. There was a small square raised table with 3 bar stools to dine on. One small wicker couch and one single arm chair. The family intended to use this as a hub for meals and family time. But because we were group of 10 there wasn't quite enough furniture for all of us to be comfortable. We made it work the 4 nights we were there. I did feel a bit isolated because the surrounding neighbors were all residential homes. And it wasn't exactly a nice and scenic surrounding area around the resort. I was really excited to do all the water activities, especially paddle boarding. But the condition of the water was a bit muddy for my liking. The water level in the morning was very low so I was a bit disappointed. Kayaking and snorkeling gear is free which was great! It is a ten-fifteen minute drive into town to pick up groceries or shop which was really convenient. It was a REALLY nice surprise that there was a wonderful farmers market inside the Windward mall on Wednesday evening from 2:30-7:30 we found all sorts of great exotic fresh fruit and vegetables. On top of all the tasty local food stands. http://www.windwardmall.com/event/farmers-market-every-wednesday/ Continental breakfast was a bit limited. Consisted of 1-2 types of cut fresh fruit (we had sweet pineapple and papaya the days were were there) , bagels, toast, and costco individually wrapped danish. Yoplay yogurt, juice, tea, and coffee was also offered. The Wednesday night Mai thi dinner was VERY nice. Live guitarist and after dinner fire dancing was GREAT! Although they forgot to announce before we headed down to the floating docks to watch the fire dancing show that there would be dessert. Rooms were clean and spacious. Beds were comfortable however we could have used a thin blanket on the cooler nights. There was just a flat sheet and a long decorative curtain panel at the foot of the bed. Also 2 out of the 3 bathroom toilets would constantly be running and not flush half of the time (frustrating!).

It truly is the junkiest place I've seen. Presumably there must be some higher-end suites somewhere on the property (the pictures on the website show somewhere nice??), but the ones I saw were like motel 6. The minute I walked in I told the young guy who was there that we needed to be moved - and there was nothing to go to as it was full. I said, we're checking out in the morning, and he said OK. Never asked \"What's wrong\" or \"why don't you like it?\" or \"How can I help\" - just, OK. I bet every single person who sees those rooms, immediately says I'm out of here. Everything I've read from unhappy customers I agree with - paper thin walls, old and uncomfortable furniture, a stove from 1960, untrained and uncaring staff, renovations going on everywhere at all hours, a dodgy neighborhood with nothing around it within walking distance. I'm not impressed with the false advertising of Paradise Bay Resort, and I feel sorry for anyone who wasn't happy but stayed anyway. The minute I checked in (by then 11pm), I got on my laptop and booked another place in Waikiki - for $150. per night, instead of the $175. we were being charged at this place. We hightailed it out of Paradise Bay first thing in the morning - and it ended up being SO much nicer, with lovely balconies looking over the ocean, great staff, and a clean and safe place. These crumby rooms seem like a roadside motel, where you could survive spending a night or two. And if they charged less than $100. and marketed it as a budget place, that would be fine. A resort it sure isn't, Even if you got one of the mystery nice rooms, the pool is tiny and the much advertised breakfast is instant oatmeal, one type of fruit and a bagel you can toast.

Yes, cats were everywhere, the smell of cat urin was so strong outside of the room that they gave us and because of my allergies, I insisted that they move us. One of our rooms were moved to a different building that the others and what a shame. 1st the maintenance personnel DO NOT work on the weekends, and all the lights going down the stairs to our room were out, and my husband and I almost fell down the steps. when I mentioned this to the desk clerk he said here's a flash light and I promise it will be fixed in the morning. But guess what it never was when I asked again the next evening why it was not fixed. We were told that they do not work on weekends. They DO NOT CLEAN ROOMS, change sheets or sweep the floors on the weekend. So we were given a broom to sweep it our selves. This was never advertised on the website as we only rented this place for the weekend. I have pictures of my husband almost falling and all the lights out and the stepts, alley way and walkway being totally dark all three nights we were there. Yes, the breakfast was nice plain and basic but ok. As far as the Mi tai night, we were told as soon as we walked up to the lobby that we could only have 2 each, and we would have to wait awhile because they ran out and had to make more. The scenery is pretty, the loby are is nice, but the hotel rooms have alot to be desired. The outside is very rundown. It looked like maybe they were just starting to landscape everything was dug up, and honestly, it looked terrible. I also took pictures of that. Out of a 10, I would give it a 2.

It is away from the husstel and bussel of Waikii, but we definately would never stay there again or recommend it. We were given a hotel comment card when we left and was told that a manager would call us about the problems we had, and I left our cell phone number, but no one ever called us back. I lost the comment card as traveled to two other island after that trip so that is why I am writing this.

B&B not a hotel.\u201d", "Author": "JulianHall", "ReviewID": "UR129546353", "Content": "This was our first stop during our honeymoon trip to Hawaii. We had considered Honolulu side, but decided that we would prefer a bit of peace and quiet in paradise for the start of our trip. We arrived via transfer, having neglected to book a rental car (much to our loss); as it is a way from the airport expect a shuttle to set you back about $50 or more for a taxi. This lack of planning was of course our fault, but a costly one! The hotel staff however were extremely helpful in arranging the nearest Rental company to come and collect us to sort out a rental as well as booking a taxi for our return. Advice - rent a car from the airport to save on transfers! Upon arrival, we were shown to our room (after the suggested check in time) to find it had not been properly cleaned. We informed the receptionist, and a very apologetic cleaning lady arrived minutes later to tidy it all and even gave us a box of chocolates by way of apology for the inconvenience, which I thought was a nice touch. We were a little let down by this first impression however and slightly bemused by the surrounding area. The resort is set down a slightly shabby residential street - no other facilities are within comfortable walking distance, no food/restaurant options - nothing. With a car this is less of an issue (see notes above), but it does mean you need to bring in all your supplies with you. Aside from a continental (bagels, yoghurt and fruit) breakfast, Paradise Bay provides no food (unless you count microwaveable cheeseburgers), which I think is a major failing in the type of Resort it is aspiring to be. I heard from several different people however that it has undergone extensive renovation over the last couple of years, so maybe this is something which it will develop in time - it would benefit the guests and the feel of the resort considerably. It is also slightly misleading with the Mai Tai evening notes - although it looks like a bar/restaurant, it does not serve drinks normally, so off to the shops again you go.... Kaneohe is not far by car (10 mins drive) and is pretty well served for shopping choices along with several dining options (think more local and lower end chain restaurants rather than fancy sit down affairs), so this served as our base for food and drink to bring back to the Resort. We would have had no problem with this if we had been aware beforehand that neither food nor drink are readily available on site, with no immediate alternative facility in place. Finding the resort on a \"Hotels\" website did unfortunately give us a slightly misinformed view of the site. This is a Bed & Breakfast not a hotel, and I do not think this is overly clear in the online information. The resort, being set in a very local area, seems also to be used regularly by the local community. Virtually every night, locals came over from the road and were playing around in the pool (noisily) for some time. Several locals also came over to enjoy breakfast on a regular basis. Perhaps this is joint owned by the community, in which case of course they would wish to avail of the facilities, or perhaps it is open to locals in order to prevent any feeling of segregation or ill feeling in the neighbourhood. Regardless, it is a little galling to those of us who have travelled a LONG way to relax and paid for the privilege too to share the area with those who can enjoy it for free. Perhaps I am missing the point, and should be more community minded, but the impression and the price tag of the \"resort\" suggest something more than they actually provide. My review is probably coming over as rather negative, however my wife and I really did enjoy our time here. The view from our room was fantastic looking our on to the river and the hills in the distance (however it was only partial bay view - more sea view commanded a considerable premium on our already non budget price). Not all the rooms benefit from such a pleasing wakeup vista - several of the rooms look out on to the residential street out the front, and I would really not have been very pleased if we had one of these! Three or four lodgings actually front out onto the bay, with many of the others like ours facing the mountains (still delightful). So in short: The pros: - View (if you have partial/full bay view) - Nice pool & hot tub - Lovely views of bay & mountains - Jungle noise in the mornings - amazing! - Fantastic views from breakfast bar - Helpful staff - Free kayaking into the bay - great fun! - Good location for Valley of the Temples and exploring the North Shore - Much quieter than the Southern side of the island The cons: - View (if you got a street facing room, which we didn't!) - Too pricey for the limited facilities available - No food/drink options available beside breakfast - Location is \"weird\" in terms of the surrounding messy residential area - Rooms not as private as could be (thin walls, wicker/bamboo screens) - Noisy locals detract from the solace Would I stay here again? If I could get a good deal on the price then yes. If they start serving proper food and drink then definitely. If you want local amenities, then look elsewhere, but for a quiet retreat it fits the bill nicely.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Bambi C", "ReviewID": "UR129344944", "Content": "Don't believe what you see on their website I wouldn't even call this a hotel.

My fianc\u00e9 and I just got back from the most amazing weekend. We just needed to get away, and wanted a nice place to relax, be near the water, and most importantly some place quite! We got it all. After getting to the resort fairly late on Friday night, around 8:30pm, we were greeted by name and checked in by Tiana. She was so kind, gave us all of our information, and even a welcome MaiTai left over from their Friday night happy hour. She escorted us to our water front suite, and when I say water front I mean the gentle waves came right up to our lanai. It was a low tide and full moon and so beautiful. The room was clean, modern, and had everything we could have asked for. We had planned to grill up some steaks that evening, and even though the grill closed at 9:00pm we promised to be very quiet and were allowed to use the grills. The kitchenette had everything we needed, and we cooked up our veggies in the suite. We brought our dinner back to the room, and enjoyed eating in the kitchenette area, with all the doors up (and screens closed) to the sound of our iPod in the provided speaker dock, and the sounds of nature. Wind, waves, birds, bugs and even a little cat fight was music to our ears. So much better than city streets, garbage trucks and fighter jets outside our apartment window in downtown Honolulu. We woke up the next morning to the birds in the trees and had a relaxing morning of drinking tea on the lanai. We got ready, and I would like to note that the water pressure in the shower was very powerful. We then went to the breakfast in the lobby, and a toasted bagel and yogurt got us set up for our snorkel cruise. Since the tide was so low, the boat crew had their work cut out for them to get the boat going, but go it did. The crew was so kind, and even with the clouds, the scenery is always breathtaking. We saw turtles galore, and the snorkeling is unreal. K-Bay is by far the healthiest reef on the island, and the fish just swarm you. The boat provided equipment, but we brought our own. Then we headed out to the sand bar, where we got to play volley ball provided from one of the other tours. Then the hot tub was just right for the cloudy day. After lunch and a Saturday afternoon nap, we got ready for dinner. It was just a short taxi ride to Haleiwa Joe's for dinner and drinks. Then about a $30 cab ride to Kailua for Fromaggio's Wine bar. We are fine with paying for taxi's (we are city people), and understood from the start that there weren't going to be too many happening places for Saturday night, so we were good. That afternoon and night at the resort, there was a wedding party right next to our room, which did get a bit noisy, but they were having a good time so it was fine with us. Another relaxing morning on Sunday was the perfect way to wrap our stay. The check out the next morning was smooth as could be.

I called two hours earlier to see if our hotel would be available before check-in time. We had a wedding to go to around the corner that evening (the reason why we decided to book the room so we could have a mini vacation) and an early check-in would make time be less of an issue. The receptionist informed us that the room wouldn't be ready until check-in time. We were fine with that and decided to explore Kaneohe instead. We arrived a little after 3pm. When we arrived, the front desk representative was assisting another guest and told us she should we back after she escorts the guests to their rooms. 2 mins later she comes back proclaiming that she forgot the room key. ::insert uncomfortable laugh:: We start to get checked-in and after 10 mins of paperwork and lack or urgency, she proceeds to \"show\" us our room. \"showing\" it to us meant that she got us lost. NO JOKE. She took us to two different rooms before proclaiming that she doesn't know where it is and that feels really bad. She was on the verge of tears. My boyfriend asks for the second time if he can see the map. She finally gives it to him the second time around and my BOYFRIEND finds the room for us. THEN, our room is not even ready! By now, it's 3:45 (45 mins past estimated check-in time). The housekeeper proclaims that the room wouldn't be ready for another 20-30 mins. Girl looks like she's about to cry again because she is smart to know how furious I am. I ask to speak to a manager. She said it's just her. I ask for another room or an upgrade. She says no. Everything's booked and there's nothing we can do. She says we can get ready in the \"spa\" room.

I just checked out today and didn't hear a thing from the manager. Utterly ridiculous. Btw, we paid for an upgrade for a View suite that was renovated.

I stayed here a year ago and enjoyed it, so I decided to stay here again for my yearly business trip. The resort has been completely renovated under the new owners, and provides a wonderful getaway. It's situated in a lush tropical setting with wonderful views of Kaneohe Bay and the Koolau Mountains. I grew up in Kaneohe, and this is where I want to be whenever I return to Hawaii. The staff are very friendly, expressing much Aloha. They often wear many hats and help out in different ways. A delicious buffet dinner is served on Wednesday nights for room guests. A big mahalo to Doreen, the fine lady who does the cooking. She also does other jobs at the resort. Hawaiian entertainment is provided at dinner. Another mahalo to Kimo (Wayne Kimokeo). I knew him from high school. Every morning, a nice continental breakfast is served with fresh papaya, pineapple, yogurt, and fresh pineapple juice. The rooms are nice and comfortable, and quiet. Sometimes you hear people walking upstairs. The rooms I stayed in both times had ceiling fans and AC. A newly renovated swimming pool and jacuzzi are on property, with beautiful blue tile. A coin operated laundry is on one end of the property. The resort is situated on a slope, and up and down access is by a steep driveway and stairways. There are no elevators. Parking is free but somewhat limited. There are no phones in the rooms. Housekeeping is provided every other day. The resort is situated in a working class, residential community. It does provide visitors a feel for actually being in the real Hawaii. This is a wonderful place for independent travelers like me. Many families with children were here during my stay. It's certainly the place I plan to return to each year.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois, United States", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL - Do Not Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "Jeff M", "ReviewID": "UR125004621", "Content": "We booked this 'Resort' online and relied of course on the pictures from their web site and Facebook site.

The room was nice, newly renovated and clean. It had a wonderful lanai with great views out over the bay.

Another nice thing, is that there are a variety of people staying there. Met folks from different places in US but also an Aussie, folks from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, etc. Was quite interesting. Almost every morning at breakfast we saw a rainbow over the bay. Breakfast could be a little more interesting but was quite adequate. My only complaint about breakfast was that it was not managed closely enough by staff, and we had to ask for things to be replenished. When we did, they kept an eye on it, however.

We questioned the 7% surcharges that were added to our room on top of all the other taxes and the woman was extremely rude and told us that we had signed a form at check in which stated we understood our bill would incur these charges. When i asked her to explain further, as far as what these taxes are for she raised her voice to both me and my husband and said we would have to take them to court if we wanted to fuss about it and it wouldnt matter anyway because to business was up for sale anyway. Unbelievably unprofessional! When i learned that the hotel was under new managment i just had to see for myself how it had changed so i reluctantly booked for our next island visit. We arrived at night and im surprised people who havent been here before can actually find the place because the buildings are so dark and gloomy it kind of gives you a haunted house feel. Mind you we paid about $150 after all the taxes for a waterfornt bungalo 2 yrs ago and and our room rate now was about $300 so i was expecting huge upgrades. The room itself did look better, the bathroom was done over and so was the kitchen but i could still here everything that went on in the adjoined room. So if you are ok with hearing your neighbor sneeze, cough and even pass gas then this is the place for you. The breakfast even got smaller. They claim to serve fresh hawaiian fruit but all i saw was canned fruit. I was suppose to stay 4 nights but happily checked out the following morning. The absolute highlight of my stay was discovering that the rude woman who once worked at the front desk was now working as a housekeeper. I guess the new management has the smarts to know that this woman did not belong dealing with customers.

While there were some favorable reviews, some in the TA community raised the concern that many of these reviewers were \u201cone-hit-wonders\u201d with little-to-no review history. Let me say, we really loved this place. The current owners have had this for about 9 months and have really fixed it up very nicely \u2013 touches of bamboo and art and hardwood floors and tropical plants and flowers everywhere. We were looking to escape the Waikiki city scene for our last 2 nights on Oahu and in some ways I don\u2019t feel like we really relaxed until we got here. We took the cheapest room, a one-bedroom kitchenette suite with technically no view and a lanai for $145 a night. I say \u201dtechnically no view\u201d because while we in reality had a \u201cparking lot view\u201d, it was frankly the nicest parking lot view I\u2019ve ever had, because all you see are mountains and vegetation, and you are surrounded by colorful plants and beautiful bamboo privacy fences. Our room was on the back side of the oceanfront units, so we were within stumbling distance of the waterfront Adirondack chairs. One thing that some could find annoying but we found to be really cool were the deafening chorus of (mynah?) birds in the adjacent mangroves and the roosters from all over the neighborhood. Expect a ruckus as the sun sets and as it rises again. You may be visited by resident chickens and little dogs that chase each other around your legs, into the water, and off to another adventure. In short, this is not some sterile resort environment, but instead you are immersed in the natural environment of windward Oahu. Neighbors seem nice and as respectful to you as you are to them. Got a nice nod from a man motoring his boat up the canal early morning, and got a shaka shaka from a lady at the gas station down the street. There\u2019s a lot of great little extras that Paradise Bay offers. Our first night there was \u201cMai Tai\u201d night, a complementary night where they treat guests to a buffet dinner, free-flowing mai tai\u2019s (which they continued to replenish long before you were ready to start looking for another), and a nice three-person Hawaiian band. While we were enjoying our relaxing evening, a steady downpour surrounded us for a brief period, but we were snug-a-bug with our mai tai\u2019s, our full plates, new friends (certainly a chummy place), and the great music. On Friday nights they have mojito night (I love mojito\u2019s!) and Saturday they take everyone out on their boat to the sandbar for a snorkeling excursion. I understand that\u2019s a popular weekend excursion for residents too, so this is probably a really good time hanging out around real people from the area. Sadly, we had to check out on Friday, so we missed these other events. Kayaks and paddle boards are available for free use during your stay. We kayaked briefly when we first got there (way before check-in time, too \u2013 thanks, Darcy!) and it was very peaceful. The only potential downside here really has nothing to do with the resort. It\u2019s only fair to mention, however, that the water in the Kaneohe area is not quite as crystalline blue as most other areas of Oahu. Still it was very peaceful and a nice place to relax waterfront or to go out kayaking or paddleboarding. Just might not be the place if you are looking for on-site beach and swimming. I also wanted to note that I think that through the use of the word \u201cResort\u201d in their name, Paradise Bay may unwittingly get themselves in trouble in terms of expectations of guests who haven\u2019t done their research. As much as I love this place, I wouldn\u2019t naturally think of it as a resort. Oasis? Absolutely. Retreat? Sure. Resort? I don\u2019t know \u2013 that word means different things to different people. They\u2019ve appointed the rooms quite nicely and have a lot of extras, but for the person looking for lavish pools and spas and boutique shops, etc etc, wow, will they be surprised. Not really what this is all about. And just a quick note on service. We had checked in (i.e. dropped off luggage, room was not ready yet) very early and then gone down to Hanuuma Bay. Returning that evening, we were tired and sticky icky and needed showers and had very little time before the Mai Tai night started. We wished out loud as we zipped up the coast, how nice it would be if our multitude of heavy bags would miraculously appear in our room. Noting that this was not a full-service resort, we did not expect this, but thought how nice it would be. Upon return, they happily informed us that everything was in our room ready for us. I proclaimed my undying love for the lady at the front desk and we headed down to our fabulous little pad. In short, I would not hesitate in recommending Paradise Bay to someone looking for a relaxing option outside of Waikiki. I may go so far as to suggest this as THE option if you don\u2019t want to pay Turtle Bay prices or deal with a VRBO rental with cleaning fees and the additional concerns that can surround rentals.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice for a relaxing vacation\u201d", "Author": "Glob R", "ReviewID": "UR120460857", "Content": "Beautiful place.

It consists of several separate buildings on a hill next to a lagoon at the entrance to Kane'ohe Bay, with 2 mountain ranges in the distance. Very beautiful. I've read some negative reviews on Paradise Bay and I think they stem from one particular building that is not so nice and is where we were first assigned. It's basically an apartment building on the street overlooking the neighborhood with the ambiant sounds of dogs, roosters, cars, children....not exactly paradise. I asked to upgrade and was accomodated with no trouble and very little extra cost. Then all was wonderful. The resort offers a few free activities which I encourage everyone to take advantage of: Friday night Mojitos, Wednesday night dinner, and especially the Saturday morning boat ride on the bay. It was a highlight of our trip, with snorkling on one of the best coral reefs I've ever been to, and a chance to walk around on the extensive sand bar. It's also a great way to meet the other guests. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are attractive and comfortable with fans and a/c, and the view is spectacular. We tried several of the restaurants the resort recommended and were never disappointed, and returned a few times to a couple of them. The windward side of Oahu gets more clouds and rain but it's very intermitent and actually a nice break from the hot sun after exploring elsewhere. Depending on your needs, I think the prices are reasonable for what you get. Larger, waterfront buildings can be pretty spendy but for a couple or small family, there are less expensive options that are great. Naturally you can get a great package deal staying in Waikiki but you'll get a Las Vegas strip ambiance that is not the real Hawaii.

It was a magical month with breathtaking views of the spectacular mountains and the water of peaceful Kaneohe Bay. The resort changed ownership in the past year and the new oweners, Stephanie and David Ryan, are really trying to spruce the place up. One can rent a studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, or even larger accomodation, all with either kitchenette or full kitchen. Our one bedroom suite was quaint with simple island decor (comfortable, not luxurious). The king size bed was extremely comfortable. We had a full kitchen. My husband would have preferred a bigger TV with cable, but we managed with the small TV and local channels. We had A/C (not all suites do) which was essential for us during the hot month of September. Our lanai (balcony) afforded us 240 degree views of spectacular scenary. The staff was so friendly and very helpful. Breakfast is simple each morning, but satisfactory and apart from the complementary fun Wednesday night Hawaiian buffet with live music, there is no restaurant for lunch or dinner. This is why the kitchen comes in so handy. There is also a small swimming pool, hot tub/jacuzzi, and a complementary 2 hour boat ride to the reef and the sand bar on Saturday mornings which is loads of fun (rain or shine). It rains more on the windward side resulting in greener scenary! Of enormous importance to us was the fact that this resort is pet friendly. We have a dog who moved to Hawaii with us, and Abby (our Golden Retriever) also loved Paradise Bay. She was provided a luxurious doggie pillow as well as dog dishes for her food and water. Everyone at the place loved her too. I highly recommend this property for anyone transitioning into or out of Hawaii. Families with children can easily be accomodated. Pets are welcome. Keep in mind that the resort is located in a quiet community neighborhood (chickens and dogs plus the mynas in the mangrove make most of the noise) and is not frenetic like Waikiki but slow paced and relaxed.

We booked a 2 bedroom room. The resort was advertising dogs were free for the month of September, but a dog room cost $175 a night ($209 after taxes) rather than the advertised price at $145. They explained to us, even though pets are free, the pet room itself (same layout and size as a regular room) cost $30 more. We decided to book it anyways. When we arrived the \"resort\" looked like a motel. It was located in in a residential area wedged between houses. When we checked in and saw our room, we were disappointed to see how small and dusty the room was. The king sized beds were twin size beds pushed together. Our view from the bedroom was a huge heap of trash. We then noticed a few ants in the kitchen. I went down stairs and asked their policy on leaving and they said we have to pay for the first night because it's nonrefundable, but we could cancel the second night, so we did. We all went to the pool to go swimming and were shocked to find the pool was dirty and had a film floating on the top. We swam anyways thinking we would shower when we got back to our room. On the way back to our room, my friends went to the spa to schedule a massage, but they said you had to schedule all spa services 24 hours in advance. We went back to our room, showered and got ready to leave for dinner. Right before we left, my husband grabbed the dog bowl provided to fill it with dog food, but noticed it was filthy and had food crusted on it. He washed the bowl and filled it with dry dog food then left for dinner. When we returned, my husband noticed the dog food and mat underneath it were covered with ants. He threw the dog food away and went downstairs to show management the mat and complain. They told my husband that they would spray tomorrow. I was changing the baby on the bed and saw ants crawling all over the comforter. This was the last straw for me. Fed up, I went downstairs to the front desk asking if we could move rooms. I was told we could only move one room over because it was a dog room. I told him that a wall was not enough to keep the ants away. Plus, the wall had a kitchen on each side, so there were holes for the pipes to run through it and the ants could run back and forth on them. He told me because we had a dog, that was the only room. I went back to the room and asked my husband if I could see how many ants were on the dog food, so he pulled the trash out, and to my horror, it was covered in ants and termites. I freaked out and went back to the front desk and asked if we could leave and get our money back. I had taken pictures of the trash to show him so he would know I was not exaggerating about the termites. He told me he had to call the managers and ask them. An hour had passed and I still hadn't heard from him, so I went back to the front desk and he said the owners said that because they spray once a month, it wasn't their problem. They said I could leave that night, but would have to pay a $50 cleaning fee just for occupying the room. It was late and the new room was bug free, so I decided to stay. Plus there were no outside lights for the walkway and it would be dangerous going up and down the stairs with no lights and arms full of luggage. I used the light from my phone to go up and down the stairs to talk to the front desk. All night a rooster form one of the houses kept crowing and kept waking up the baby all night long. When I woke up in the morning, there were ants and termites all over the kitchen sink, kitchen counter and just ants in the shower. Nobody showered in the new room's bathroom, so I have no idea why they would be in the shower and we didn't eat or cook anything in the kitchen either.

It's in a lush, green area, unlike the brown around most of the rest of the coast, with views across the bay to the mountains. Highway 3 gets you to the airport in well under an hour. We were lucky to be there for a complimentary buffet dinner and Hawaiian music on Wednesday. We left before the social drinks on Friday evening and a boat trip to the sand bar on Saturday. I think we took the cheapest room option which was fine for us, as was the complimentary buffet breakfast, which included fresh fruit and yoghurt. The staff were friendly and helpful. In the vicinity, Haliewa Joe's restaurant was a short drive away and a delight, set in a garden and with mountains as a backdrop. We enjoyed walking in the botanical garden at Kaliewa and there were trails at Ka'a'awa reserve a short drive away, one impassable in the forest. Kahama reserve's trails may be better. We'll certainly recommend Paradise Bay to our friends, and return there ourselves if we do another round-the-world trip.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Juneau, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced\u201d", "Author": "bettmark", "ReviewID": "UR118210257", "Content": "We chose this place for its distance from Waikiki, even though it was much more expensive than the nice resort hotels on Waikiki Beach. Not directly on Kaneohe Bay but on a small, muddy waterway that exits into the bay. In a local neighborhood, poorly marked directions into property. No AC, rooms are clean, sparse, with very nice sized lanais but drably painted in army green, black & brown, poor WiFi reception. The property is very small and crowded, only 40 rooms and roads going down the middle of the property. Very noisy, especially if there is any rain, cars spin their wheels trying to get up the steep incline and voices carry a long way. Construction underway and the noise was amazing, compounded by the workers talking loudly. Breakfast was pretty disappointing. Watery juices, bagels, bread for toasting, small yogurts, cottage cheese, coffee & tea. All carbs, no protein at all. The pool is tiny, not very inviting. Great dock w/ocean kayaks available. We paid $165 for a $195 room looking directly at the muddy \"creek\". The staff was pretty friendly, out of state owners. We moved to the Sheraton Kaiulani with a $12 resort fee that included free WiFi, free parking, free beach towels & beach chairs, an attendant came to the beach and brought us free cold water and cold fruit - all for $25 a night less than what we were paid at Paradise Bay Resort .

However, the cons outweighed the pros and when we finally decided to check out 2 days early, the reaction from mangement was defensive and poor - not what you would expect from a business trying to attract customers. Pro's: Decent size condo unit, good kitchen. Free w-fi (although slow). Free parking. The Saturday boat excursion was the best part of the stay. Breakfast was decent. Con's: Too many bugs! Tiny ants all over the lobby tables. Mosquitoes kept me awake at night. We had several bites from mosquitoes and fleas (there are feral cats all over the neighborhood as well as wild chickens). The resort in in a low-income, run-down area and you definitely do not get a welcoming feel from the locals around there. Poorly lit bathroom, paint peeling from the walls, shower curtains had mildew. TV was an old model and remote didn't work. Our lanai was small and not covered so we couldn't use it much due to all the rain. It was also very noisy when the other units nearby had social gatherings. Main complaint was the price! $275 a night (came out to over $300 w/taxes) for the 2-bedroom premium view unit was not worth it! We spoke to other guests - one couple paid $135/night through a Groupon special for a 2 bedroom unit on the water. Another family paid $179/night for a 3 bedroom non-view unit.

This would be fine, but the price--we paid $200 per night to stay a couple--demands a higher level of overall quality. Good points: The staff is incredibly friendly, and you aren't anywhere near the bustle of Waikiki. The free internet and free parking are really nice, although the free internet is a public access point and can't do high-speed streaming (no Netflix instant!). The Wednesday night with music was lovely. Finally, it really is nice to have a fridge and mini-kitchen. Bad points: There is no A/C, and it gets humid. Hopefully, you won't spend tons of time in your room, but I would worry about this if you are used to A/C. The biggest problem, by far, is NOISE LEVELS. These are cheap apartments which have been converted into hotel rooms. While they have obviously renovated the exterior, the facility wasn't originally intended as a hotel, and therefore the walls are incredibly thin. Unlike a normal hotel, even when people are talking in the next room at a reasonable level, you still hear them. (It wasn't just our room; at check-out, one of the other guests mentioned the ame thing.) It's even worse on the lanai. I had a vision of sitting quietly together a couple and looking out at a beautiful bay. Unfortunately, the family next door was playing cards on their lanai. They were at a very reasonable noise level, but the walls were so thin, it was just weird to be out on ours. What's the point of staying at a quiet resort away from the bustle of Waikiki if you just end up hearing the conversations of the guests in the next room? I know a number of other posts have mentioned parties. One our second and third nights, we had issues with parties as well. They weren't wild parties, but the walls are way too thin to accommodate even a small crowd. I don't know if this was just bad luck, or if this resort seems to attract large groups. Other quick notes: be warned that this part of the island seems more foggy than the beachside locations, so the views aren't sky blue. There are small issues with the operation of the hotel, e.g. the maid forgot to clean our room one day, the radio appeared to be broken, and they manager did not reply quickly when the toilet broke. Overall, it's a decent hotel, which has a few problems. I think this hotel would be very reasonable at $140/night, but I expected more for $200/night.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "LKR1982", "ReviewID": "UR114133690", "Content": "Friendly staff, family feel to the resort, quiet (except for the restoration work taking place) and absolutely stunning views.

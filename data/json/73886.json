Rooms are old and dated, lobby smells very bad and these guys are cheap, cheap, cheap. My daughter headed down to breakfast at 8:30 am . No coffee and she asked them to make some , they ignored her. Another lady asked the woman at the desk and no answer she just walked down a hall. I came down 10 min later and asked. Nothing happened. 10 min later after I was almost done with breakfast I asked again and was told by the womans husband that it was now 10 min until breakfast was over and they told me they would not make more coffee because they had to make 25 cups at one time. Oh my goodness, so no coffee for breakfast!!!! She said if I wanted coffee I had to go to my room and make it!. As a Best Western Diamond member I stay at many Best westerns a year.

Worst service! The room itself was large and had potential but that's where it ends. We travel for a living. Stay in hotels 60 days straight and this is the first really bad review I've written. The towels were stained and one of them had a hole in it the size of my fist. Sheets were so worn there were holes in them. We tried to call the front desk for more but no one answered when we let it ring repeatedly. Big sign out front says high speed Internet but it wasn't wireless. I asked and the guy at front said they were required by Best Western to have hard wired Internet. Horse crap. I stayed in three other best westerns this week and they all had wireless. I actually took the towels to the front to show them and told the we had called but he said no way, they had been there the whole time as if we were lying.

David stood in line while I walked next door to the Best Western, which looked very clean. First thing I saw was a sign that said \"No Pets,\" which gave me pause because we were traveling with our seven-pound papillon. Nonetheless, I spoke with the clerk and asked for his best available rate, which happened to be the same as the La Quinta. Free wifi, all suites, sounded good. \"But you don't accept pets,\" I said to the clerk. He asked what kind of pet, size, etc., and then said it would be okay as long as the dog stayed in his carrier the whole time. I asked to see a room, so he gave me a key to a room on the second floor and I was so pleasantly surprised. I called David immediately. He was still standing in line behind the bikers. He called La Quinta's 800 number and cancelled our reservation; we checked into the Best Western. The air conditioning was excellent; the mattress was firm; the pillows were abundant and fluffy; the decor was a little overdone but everything was SO CLEAN. This was a suite--or what today goes as a suite: There was a sitting area with loveseat, lounge chair, and desk as one entered the room; then through an archway, one enters the sleeping area. The bathroom fixtures, granite countertops, and furniture all looked new. There wasn't actually wifi; an Ethernet cord was required. But this hotel was close enough to the La Quinta that we could tap into its network. The hotel was also VERY quiet, with what seemed to be a nice clientele. I went back down to the front desk to compliment the clerk and found him talking to a couple of the bikers who had been in line at the La Quinta. He was telling them they were welcome to stay but absolutely forbid their revving the engines of their motorcycles in the parking lot!

I was wrong - my mistake. I checked in at midnight and when I walked in the room it looked okay. I checked to make sure the sheets on the bed were clean, they were, but the blanket (the thin one that is in between the sheet and comforter) was COVERED with hair. The bathroom was not up to par. The toilet seat had droplets of pee on it along w/a little poo. I took out my small can of lysol and disinfected it along w/the tub since that had a little hair in it from whoever that had stayed in the room prior to me coming in. I was utterly grossed out!! I would have left then BUT I had an infant w/all the \"stuff\" that goes along that we dragged up to the room (3rd floor) and was exhausted. I figured I would take it up w/the manager the next morning. When I checked out the next morning I told the front desk clerk (only person there) about the problem, and said that they needed to pay their cleaning people more. She never apologized, never offered a discount, nothing. She responded ,quite proudly I might add, that their cleaning people get paid $8.50 an hour. I have sworn off any Best Western's for the rest of my life and will gladly pay a lot more to stay at a Hampton Inn or Hilton. You get what you pay for, I suppose. I paid approx $75 and that is relatively a small amount of money, but ...it's the point. Why should I pay that amount for something that the manager of the hotel would not sleep in himself? Don't they take any pride in it?? Wouldn't you want to feel confident about the place knowing you have the best price, okay location (depending on what direction you're coming from) and a decent staff to help the clients?? Apparently not.

The sea house restaurant is practically on the beach, but is not intrusive, and has great food and drinks, which you can just charge to your room. Napili bay is a little more protected on the north side, napili kai side, so the water is practically always calm. Close to other great snorkeling spots and Honolua Bay.

Well worth the 0.5 mile walk to the gazeebo on the other resort at the end of the beach - great food, good value and friendly staff. The main downside was our room. Although the room (we had studio above the main lobby) was a good size and had a really, really good view of the beach it was looking quite dated. i.e. lots of beige plastic, couple of sockets not working, scuff marks and scratches here and there and a generous sized bed, but it had seen better days (mattress felt worn and the bedding could be crispier). Also, not a problem for me, but there are no curtains/blinds to the room; the front of which is a large balcony/windows overlooking the beach.

Whether it was an activity we wanted to do or a restaurant we wanted to eat at, they were helpful with both suggestions and even making reservations for us (and that's not even part of their job!) Every night, we would go over to the front desk just to talk and get some juice. They were extremely friendly. The first night we arrived, we wanted something to eat immediately -- so we grabbed a table at the Sea House. There was no wait and we were seated almost immediately. My wife got the delicious and succulent lobster and I got the seafood trio -- both were equally amazing. Paired with a great bottle of white wine and some desert for both of us, it was worth every penny we paid for that meal. The ocean-view was spectacular. The sound of the ocean waves lightly crashing in the morning, there's really no better way to wake up in the morning. The beach was clean, pleasant, and always enjoyable. We were able to bring some champagne out to the grassy area right in front of the beach and relax...it was incredible. There are plenty of restaurants nearby in case you don't want to eat at the Sea House and there is plenty of shopping and activities as well. All within 15 minutes driving. Needless to say, 5 out of 5 stars is no where near sufficient for this resort. It should have at least 10 or 15 stars.

Rooms are called hotel rooms as opposed to studios or suites which are available in other buildings. This is a building of 12 units, 6 up and 6 down, but the problem is that all rooms are adjoining. There is only a single door connecting your room to the next room and there is a fairly large space beneath the door. The result is that even normal conversations in the next room are heard clearly. It was like being in the room with your neighbors. Fortunately, we were able to be moved to another room where no one was next door and everything was great from then on.

Napili Kai is not a high rise luxury resort, there is no room service, infinity pools, cabana's, or even valets, but what they do have, in our opinion, is so much better. The resort is located directly on Napili Bay, with gorgeous views of Lanai and Molokai in the distance. The grounds are immaculately kept and spread out, no building is over two stories high. You have easy access to both Napili and Kapalua Bays, two of the most beautiful beaches on Maui.

Our studio in the Puna II building was recently and very beautifully renovated. We had the most incredible ocean front location, probably only 20 feet from the water crashing on the rocks. We spent hours sitting on our lanai, enjoying the comfortable outdoor furniture watching the ocean, the sunrise, the sunset, and the stars (it felt like our own private cabana). The large sliding doors opened up 2/3 of the way across the room giving the entire space an outdoor feeling and allowing in a nice breeze and the sounds of the ocean waves.

I was a bit concerned about choosing the Napili Kai, but we stayed 9 days and loved it. The motto is \"the unhurried way of life\" and it is. We stayed in the renovated Puna 2 building in a one bedroom that was really a 2 bedroom - nice galley kitchen, 2 bathrooms, beautiful view of Lanai and Molkai depending on where you sit outside. It was a more expensive room and one with air conditioning and possibly we would have been fine in one of the rooms that have not been renovated. It was a very relaxing and peaceful vacation and we all feel totally rejuvenated. We have stayed at some of the worlds finest hotels and resorts, and although the Napili Kai experience is authentic and understated, but definately not for those who must have over the top amenties. My 12 year old twins were at first disappointed with the small size of the pools and that the hotel wasn't \"fancy\", but grew to love it and the area. Nice putting green that my son went to every day. We thought the restaurant was OK - expensive for dinner, but lovely setting. We liked the fact that it was a bit cooler and breezier in this part of the island. The one thing that was a bit weird was that there was a matress pad with some plastic on our bed that mad me sweat. We asked that it be changed to a regular matress pad which they did promptly. The hotel said it was a mistake. Loved this part of the island - no highrises, and Puna 2 is between the Napili Beach and the Kapalua beach. Good snorkeling on Napili and even better snorkeling on Kapaua Beach. Saw turtles at both beaches. We loved going to DT Fleming beach just a couple of miles away at the end of the day to play in the waves, but be careful, because it can be rough. Also a bit further north is Slaughterhouse beach - very beautiful, and amazing snorkeling at Honolua Bay - a private marine perserve - no sand, rocks and fantastic snorkeling. You can walk to the Gazebo restaurant down the beach for breakfast and lunch - beautiful views. We did our grocery shopping at Napili Plaza which is just 5 minutes away. The morning talks at Napili Kai under the open tent are very interesting. We love Lahaina so had lunch and dinner there several times. Stumbled upon Aloah Plate which was inexpensive, good authentic Hawaiin food and noodles, and nice views. Time your visit so that you can listen to the music from the Laua next door. We enjoy Cheeseburgers in Paradise right on the water, but they come on too strong with the attempts to sell tee-shirts and other products. Next time I would like to rent a stand up paddle board that many of the guests staying on Napili Bay were using. Rented snorkel equipment from Snorkel Bobs in Napili - note that if you rent more than a week, they charge the more expensive daily rate, not the pro-rated weekly rate on the extra days.

It came as a recommendation from a travel agent friend. The first time (11 years ago), we stayed in the Aloha building, in an Ocean View studio. There was no A/C (some buildings have it, others don't), but it had a ceiling fan. We were there in the summer, and while I was fine, my wife likes a chilly room to retreat to and therefore vowed that she would take an A/C room next time. Our second visit (more recently), we stayed in an Ocean Front studio in the Puna 2 building. This time we stayed in an A/C unit. The Ocean Front rooms, do not have safe access to the water immediately in front of the rooms due to the rocks, but in my opinion they had the best views due to the way they are situated (the website has a map where you can check out the building locations. The Beach Front rooms had more direct access to the beach, but the Ocean Front rooms were a simple and quick walk away. The onsite restaurant had decent food - we ate some very nice fish there one night, but we liked going into Lahaina (just 10 minutes away) each night so we did not eat there enough to give an objective opinion. The studio units have a kitchenette (their regular rooms only have a mini-fridge), so you can prepare your own food, if needed. Even though we ate out every night, we enjoy having that option. We typically ate a simple breakfast in the room every day, and if we planned on hanging out locally all day it was nice to be able reheat food and or prepare quick food (and don't forget cheaply!), so we could get back to the pool/beach quickly. The pools weren't anything spectacular, but remember that this is a low-rise, low-key resort. You stay here to avoid the crowds and have an old-fashioned Hawaiian resort experience. The pools served their purpose - taking a dip to cool off. I prefer spending my time on the beach on vacation anyway - I didn't spend all that money to sit at a pool. The beach was nice - there are only a few resorts in Napili Bay, and there is decent snorkeling there. The neighboring beach, Kapalua Bay Beach, has very nice snorkeling and it's very picturesque... only a short 2-3 minute walk away. Napili Bay was still relatively more quiet and laid back, and still a very nice beach. If you are looking for a laid-back more traditional Hawaiian vacation, and want to avoid the crowds of the high-rise or large resorts, I think Napili Kai is definitely worth checking out. 1/2 the people I met there were repeat visitors, and all referred to it as their little secret.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redondo Beach", "Title": "\u201cLove this place\u201d", "Author": "barking1RedondoBeach", "ReviewID": "UR115848449", "Content": "Have been staying at this property for many years and have also been recommending it for as long.

We had two separate rooms. We had a room in the Honolua wing and also on Keaka I. The Honolua was a beachfront studio and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have asked for a better room with a view. We had a balcony, and in my opinion, was best so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to hear or deal with people walking around, etc. There were 2 chairs for sitting and reading as well as a table with 3 chairs for dining. The lanai had a lounger, 2 chairs and 2 side tables. The room had a kitchen with a full refrigerator and a stove with two burners and the room also came equipped with dishes, silverware, pots and pans, and cooking utensils. It also had a coffee maker and a toaster. We booked this room because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat out every meal, and it was great for keeping milk, drinks, and some breakfast items and toast. The only thing that we wished the housekeeping staff did was to clean any dishes found in the sink or if it's been washed, to put it away so it would be neat when we got back to our room. We had this service at our last resort and just assumed we'd get it here. The pillows were really soft, but flattened out quickly. But, no problem there, I just asked for more pillows and it was sent within a few minutes. Because of the long flight, we got in late so by the time we got settled and unpacked and ready to hit the beach, the pool cabana was closed. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to use our room towels, so once again, no problems there- I just called and the beach towels were sent within a few minutes. My husband and I enjoyed our Honolua room and our friend stayed with our two kids, 4 and 2 years old in the Keaka I building. They had a ground floor room and it overlooked the putting green, pool, and the beach. It was labeled as an Ocean View room and it was that and more. Their lanai was a lot more spacious than ours. The staff was very good at making sure that the crib was ready, made up, and had plenty of sheets and blankets available. This room had a mini fridge, coffee maker, and the bathroom had a separate toilet, shower, and tub area. The tub had Jacuzzi jets! The room was even larger than ours. The tv was a new flat screen model too. The one in our Honolua room, which we found hidden in an armoire was older, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to watch tv. We initially thought we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one. Same issue with the pillows, but no worries. The kids enjoyed the sofa that was in the room. The lanai had 3 full loungers and a table. It was quite spacious. The grounds were upkept and beautiful. The kids went on walks very early in the morning to look at the fish in their little pond with a waterfall. Also they had to hurry to pick any flowers because the workers were very diligent in keeping the grounds clean. It became a game to find flowers on the ground. The fitness center was open 24 hours. It was small, with 2 treadmills, 2 steppers, and an exercise bike as well as a nautilus weight machine and a stand of free weights. There was enough room on the floor to pull out mats and stretch out as well. The air conditioning was on and was cold. Towels were also provided and there was a water fountain as well. The steppers, treadmills, and bike had a tv attachment, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it because I just looked out the window and looked at trees, flowers, and the ocean. The Sea House restaurant provided good food, even if the service was a bit slow at times. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too much of a problem, because it was beachside and the view and the breeze made up for it. Everyone was nice and friendly. We ate a breakfast, a couple of lunches- quick sandwiches, and a dinner there. I have to say the Philly from Napili was one of the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tasted, it was full of lean meat and also came with an au jus. They made their own home fries, which looked like ridged potato chips, but they were better than any store bought chip. A dinner favorite was the crab stuffed prawns (jumbo) and went great with an appetizer called Maui Beach Balls. We ordered two servings. The beach. Lovely to hear the waves as we slept at night. During the day it was nice and not too crowded. Plenty of room to run around, walk, and play with the family. The waves were gentle most of the time. This was a good beach to bring our children to. The water was nice and clear and snorkels were available for free at the Make halo (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I spelled that wrong) which provided snacks, putters and balls for the putting green, and towels. Every morning about 10 there would be free tea, coffee, juice, pineapples at a cabana located on the beach. The Napili bay is small, and enclosed and provided wonderful swimming opportunities. A bit further out, there were a lot of colorful fish and turtles around. Other amenities I saw were the spa, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it, and the boutique located next to it. I went in, and it was small, but had a good selection of shirts, dresses, cover-ups, shorts, Hawaiian shirts, sandals, jewelry, and a few drugstore items such as pain relievers and sunscreen. There were items for children as well as men, but mostly for women. The prices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad comparatively to nearby resorts and stores. The best was the helpful, warm feeling we got from the staff, again Hazel and Yvette, who provided advice from shopping for clothes, groceries, souvenirs, dining, to Bill at the Expedia desk who arranged a wonderful Atlantis submarine tour. Their warmth, friendliness, and helpfulness made our vacation what we envisioned it to be. The resort also helped us out because we had 2 young children who needed naps before we left for our 9:30 PM flight. We were so sad to say goodbye, feeling as if we made good friends. We cannot wait to go back. In fact, last year we were staying somewhere else, was visiting and within 5 minutes of being at Napili Kai wanted to move there. We actually made the decision to come back and to stay at Napili Kai to make sure we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dreaming about how nice it was. Well, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. It was a nice, relaxing, and wonderful as we dreamed it could be and more. Napili Kai has earned repeat business and loyalty from our family.

You have to be aware however, that not all the resort rooms are updated, and you essentially get what you pay for, the choice ranging from non-updated rooms with ocean views at an angle only from their lanai, to beautifully appointed rooms truly on the ocean front and a variety of rooms inbetween (We looked at a few.).

The resort has a \"homey\" \"family\" feel and everyone greets you with a smile, even the other guests. There are towels, snorkel equipment, small ice chests and other items available at the beach hut for free. I enjoy jogging and there is the Kapalua trail right next to the resort that follows the ocean up to the Ritz Carleton Resort, a great 3 mile roundtrip. This is not a large, spread out resort with lots of space.

I was nervous about booking a place, so I asked around. Many folks recommended the Napili Kai. As you have read in many reviews on this site, people found the rooms to be outdated. I can only review the room that I stayed in, which was in the building called \"Puna II\". It was totally renovated, with op to date appliances and furniture. Everything was new, and it was quite lovely. We enjoyed our room immensely, and it was cleaned neatly every day we were there. We even made our bed, and each day the maid re-made our bed! LOL. Anyway, it was a great room, #240, which was on the second floor, on the corner of the building. It had an incredible view, and since it was on the corner, we got an extra wide view of the ocean from two fronts. Excellent! We really enjoyed sitting out on the large patio, overlooking the beautiful Pacific. We saw whales and a sea turtle not far out to sea from our patio. The pools are right below, so you can go swimming in relative quiet if you want, instead of going to the Pacific. The lounge chairs were rarely used, and we never had problems finding empty ones. The beach is near enough that it is convenient, and far enough where you don't get the noise from the beach crowd. The beach is gorgeous, and the water is so nice and not too cold. Snorkeling was great, but best when you swam to the right side of the beach (west) and went up around the point. It was great out there. Be careful of the reef in the center of the bay as I nearly got stuck on it. I didn't realize it was so high! We did not try any of the restaurants, as we had stopped at Costco at the airport and bought all of our food to cook ourselves which we greatly enjoyed. The restaurants looked good, and the food looked good, but as always in Hawaii, overpriced. The kitchens in the units are fully stocked with everything you will need, so no need to worry about that. There are barbecues below near the pool for everyone to use also. We loved cooking in our kitchen. One of the more beautiful aspects of this hotel is its location which is so lovely. You can walk west from the hotel and walk nearly two miles, right on the beach, past the Four Seasons and see some marvelous sites on the shore. Also if you walk up two more miles there are some great snorkeling beaches off of the 30 highway. There are hardly any people there too. Worth the walk or drive. The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is that the staff at times seemed unfriendly, like they really didn't like their jobs, or were just in a bad mood. I know it's a job and not many people like their jobs, but you could at least fake it. Especially at the towel cabana, I felt like I was putting them out and \"making them work\", or just annoying them when I asked them to change my towel. Our maid was very friendly however, as was the young lady who checked us in, she was quite personable. Overall, this is a very nice hotel, well worth the price, especially if you stay in the Puna II building.

Although we were shown about 4 other units in different buildings for possible relocation, (and the very sweet, helpful reservations girls were extremely accommodating in their attempts to assist), 3 of the 4 were worse than our original unit. Whether it was the uninspired, dated decor, the moldy smells, or spartan mattresses, we kept thinking there was \"nothing that a multi-million dollar upgrade couldn't fix\" in order to return the old gal to her former splendor. Only one unit was what we would call outstanding - a recently and thoroughly updated unit (A/C included) that would slam-dunk a 9-10 rating. Once again (unfortunately), we were booked for 6 nights and this unit was only available to us for the first 2 of them, so it hardly seemed worth the complications. At least the unit we decided to stick with wasn't moldy and had been about 70% updated. It's a real shame. The exceptional location tempts you to stay and play, but the reality for us was that we found ourselves wanting to escape the accommodations for the day, returning only at night for a place to bathe and sleep.

The \"Napili Kai 'Family' \" that we met were outstanding as well. This group of approx. 60 guests have been gathering at Napili Kai for over the past 20+ years at the same time each year. As first timers, we were taken in by the \"Family\" as new members and had a great time. The facility was created in 1960 and a major part of the overall feel was established and that is that the guests were to be treated as \"family\".. We can only tell you that the \"family feeling\" has been maintained up through our visit. It was a great visit and very hard to leave when our departure date arrived. The resort does not have any buildings over two stories high and is very relaxing with breath taking views from the lanai (balcony) where we looked at the bay and ocean through palm trees, etc.. We had a kitchen that included virtually everything...dinnerware, serving pieces, cutlery, microwave oven, refrigerator, dishwaster, stove/oven, etc. The only thing that we would like to see added would be a ceiling fan for the lanai (balcony). While the room did not have a/c, the ceiling fan worked just fine in making us comfortable. The two Puna buildings have air conditioning and are right on the ocean. We looked at some rooms in both of the buildings and found that one has been refurbished and was just outstanding. The other one is scheduled for a refurbishing sometime this year if I am not mistaken. Our lanai (balcony) had 2 lounge chairs and a small table as well as two additional chairs with another little table. There was enough room on the lanai to bring out the table from the main room & two chairs when we had guests over. As mentioned above, the view from the room was outstanding. At night you would hear and see the waves with their white crests come rolling in to the beach. You could also see Molokai from our lanai. What a way to wake up in the morning or close out the night... SO RELAXING ! ! The grounds are beautifully maintained. The staff (everyone > reservation staff, counter staff, recreation staff, house keeping, etc ) made us feel like we were part of their family. Several of them have said that their jobs at Napili Kai were the best that they have ever had and that they are treated as \"family\" by their management. Quite an endorsement. We even met the person who set up our reservations. She has been there 18 years..she loves it there... The resort also created a special Non Profit Foundation for the children of the employees... Great program and the various shows that they put on at night help support it throughout the year... The resort has daily events that are a little different than normal... daily 10am get together with fruit drink, coffee, and pineapple slices while at the same time experiencing different cultural events (basket weaving, lei making, coconut husking, etc.) that were very interesting. Monday night Putting contest w/ .50 cent drinks, Wed nites the hotel hosts a free Mai Tai party where you can mingle with the other guests and get to know each other AND MUCH MORE... Great social events ! ! To sum it up, we plan on going back to the Napili Kai on a regular basis and especially in February to visit with our family again.

We had been to Maui in the past and stayed at resorts closer to Lahaina. Last year we stayed at the Sheraton and loved it. We did not think any resort would be better than the Sheraton and the Sheraton's location. But we were wrong. We enjoyed the Napili Kai Resort. Yes, it is alittle out of the way but not that far. About 15 minute drive to Lahaina. Since we enjoy just hanging around the pool and beach, this was the perfect place. However, if you like to venture out, they have someone at the resort to help plans events. And you are not that far from things. Why we liked this place better than staying at the Sheraton, and the other resorts near that area. 1. No parking fee. Also, our parking area was a 1 minute walk from our room. Easy for carrying groceries. 2. No fee for use of lounge chairs on the beach. No problems finding a chair. 3. There is a 3 mile walking trail next to the Napili Kai, that takes you along the coast. We saw beach weddings every night around 5pm. 4. Having a kitchen and grills saves you so much time and money. 5. Many small pools. In fact, my husband and I would hang out by one of the pools and we had the place to ourselves. You had the pool behind you and the ocean in front of you. Perfect. 6. Nice staff 7. The snorkeling was not as nice as the black rock by Sheraton but we found the best spot to see lots of turtles. Walk down the Napili beach, past the other Napili resorts until you get to the point where there are black rocks. There is a path along these black rocks. Take this until you get around the point to a cove. The black rock path will lead you to the sidewalk of another resort. About a 5 minute total walk. Where shoes. You will then find this cove where there are dozens of giant sea turtles. You will see the signs stating to stay away from the turtles. Perfect for snorkeling. Jump in the water and you will see dozens of giant sea turtles. Well worth it. The only compliant we had was the service at the resort restaurant was slow.

I was told by some other guests that they had planned on updating all the rooms in Puna Point this year, but delayed it because of last year's shaky visitor economy. Last year we stayed in a great studio in the Aloha wing that had been more recently updated. The Puna 2 building was completely renovated and modernized last year.

Takes about 15 minutes to drive south to Kaanapali and Lahaina Town. Go north and you'll find several other great beaches for snorkeling/swimming. The beach is one of the best swimming beaches around. Keep in mind it's not a desolate, remote beach, though, so expect others to be there. Check out the webcam on the NKBR website. I'm convinced there are no bad rooms at Napili Kai; some have just been renovated more recently. The resort is very quiet, and not recommended for those looking for Cancun style nightlife. (Try any Kaanapali resort for that!). The resort's Sea House restaurant was generally excellent, and not gaspingly expensive (compared to other places on the island).

I called the front desk and they didn't respond. And then in the middle of the night I was woken up by a group having a party on the beach. I didn't sleep much that night.

We chose the Napili Kai for it's low key, low rise appeal, and the unbeatable beach access. The bay is gorgeous, friendly & safe for young kids swimming. There are lots of activities, and quite a few other restaurants within walking distance-for a small area there's lots to see and do. The excellent Sea Horse Restaurant has a varied menu-all delicious with huge portions, all day drinks, and free kids menu meals-with a fun mix of locals and guests mingling at the bar. At that moment, with the sand in your toes, and the tropical winds blowing, a mai tai in hand, the ukelele player and his buddies singing charmingly off key, whole place is magical. But it took awhile to get there. We arrived to find our suite unavailable(almost $700 a night for one weeks' stay, normally $820)-the A/C was leaking and the roof was sagging due to water weight. The AC we had specifically requested having read all the reviews of how hard it was to sleep without it -either due to noise, or humidity. Given a choice of 2 non connecting one bedrooms (not great to split up with small kids) at the far end of the property, or a one bedroom with sleeping area (separated by shoji screens from the LV RM) but without AC-we went with the later. The room in Puna Point had great views with a nice grassy area in front. But for 4 nights we slept uncomfortably with fans going, in hot, stuffy rooms, and a cast of unsupervised teenagers hanging out in the adjacent pool until all hours. The staff made some attempts to shut down their festivities, but mostly, they just moved on to another pool, or the beach. By the 5th night our suite was 'ready\"-we packed up and moved 3 adults , 2 kids, beach paraphernalia, and kitchen of food. The Ohana suite (feels like a 70's condo unit with lots of fake potted plants) is enormous, with a washer/dryer, 2 separate BR's and baths, a balcony, and finally, AC! We arrived to find maintenance people working on the living room blinds for 3 hours. It felt very much like the unit was under renovation. The staff were very apologetic and offered a $400 credit, but it certainly didn't feel like we got the room we booked and paid handsomely for, until the last 3 nights of our stay. Normally, we wouldn't recommend a place that so casual about it's obligations, especially at this price, but there are so many other wonderful qualities: the location, the history, the interesting repeat clientele, and the chance to mingle with families of 3 generations all vacationing together.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWow - a slice of paradise!\u201d", "Author": "Holland-Hawaii", "ReviewID": "UR76361136", "Content": "We were advised in regard to a number of properties by a local expert on accommodation and activities on Maui, Donna Bender.

Our kids, 12 and 14, were able get out directly to the beach, coming and going as they pleased. The elimination of the logistics in organizing this was great, and since the beach the hotel is on is an A+, the relaxation factor was maximized.

It really is a low-key, very quiet group of rooms. No building is over two stories tall, so look elsewhere for you skyscraper fans. There's tons of reviews here already, so I'll limit mine to things I haven't yet seen or disagree with. We stayed in a Keaka room, with air conditioning, while my girlfriend's parents stayed in another building which did not. I'm not sure about the necessity of it, though - we used it to dry out the air of the room much more than cool it down, as it reached about 70F each night. It wasn't a huge deal when we were in the other room. If you're from a much cooler climate, you may want it, but I hail from Southern California, where temperatures can reach well above the usual 85F found here. It should also be mentioned that the Keaka room I stayed in was much larger than a standard hotel room - the lanai was huge, bathroom was similarly huge with separate jacuzzi tub and shower, and the king bed didn't take up nearly all the space in the room. The bed was two twins pushed together, which reminded me of a cruise ship bed - not hugely thick or pillow-topped, but there was a box spring, and it was plenty comfortable. I've had hotel beds much worse. I laughed when I saw others complaining about the resort rules. Really, they're common courtesy, and not difficult to follow. Want proof? Here they are, summarized: don't hang bathing suits and towels over lanai railings (they'd probably blow away anyway), don't put grease or bones down the garbage disposals, only use the resort BBQs - not your own, don't remove pool furniture, age restrictions on the hot tub - nobody under 16 after sunset (adult swim? Heck yeah), quiet hours 10p-8a, no pets, don't touch the coral reef, don't store bikes/etc in hallways, no fireworks, don't shortcut through [meticulously maintained & beautiful] shrubbery, and don't take home rocks/sand/coral. That's it. In exchange for following those simple rules, things like towel service, sporting equipment (croquet, bocce, putters & balls, snorkel gear) are free of charge, which was a pleasant surprise. If I could change one thing, this geek would like to have an ethernet cable that was 10' longer so that it reached out to the lanai. Seriously, the one time I didn't bring an cable with coupler, I wanted it. Oh well, that's hardly a complaint. Other geeks may be interested to know that the bandwidth appears to be 1mpbs/384kbps per person, which is horrible on the mainland, but reasonable if you look up the cost and bandwidth available to island residents. I don't really know whether it's a decent value or not, as I got it as part of a air/hotel/car combo from Costco. If I do my math properly, and guesstimate on the value of the car and airfare, I'd say we paid about $1600 for 8 nights. Sounds reasonable, though I can't compare to other resorts.

We have been to Oahu and Kauai and still like Kauai best but we really enjoyed this hotel and the location on Maui (much better than Kanapali!) Maui is very dry and being up at the NW end of the island was more lush (more like Kauai), but also very windy in the afternoons! It was fine for us because it kept it from feeling too hot. We also got some rain showers once in awhile in the late afternoon but they only lasted a few minutes. It was not a big deal. This can be common on the islands. For the Hotel: The LOCATION on the beach is hard to beat and every room has an ocean view although some are better than others. We had a room with a mini fridge but without a kitchenette, next time I would get one with a kitchenette so we would have more freedom to eat in our rooms (eating out gets soo $$expensive). This hotel is owned by shareholders. As such, there are usually a handful of them hanging out there. They are very friendly and make the place feel more like a time-share than a hotel. The ROOMS are clean and very spacious but a bit dated. They could really stand to replace the old-school itchy bedspreads, and blankets with soft european lightweight duvets & duvet covers -and get some new beds (not very firm). Flatscreen TVs would be a nice update and I would have liked knowing ahead of time that there was a DVD player in the room! The BATHROOMS are pretty plain/ugly but gigantic and clean. Its Hawaii after all, they could add some pretty colored walls and art work to make them feel more spa-like. They do have jetted tubs AND stall showers! A few more hooks all over the place would be helpful!! The lanai/balconies are large with chairs out there and views. No hanging things over the rail though, you have to drape them on your chairs. Here are some more PROS: ~ 18 hole FREE Putt-Putt golf is a blast. My husband played every day. Also has a smaller kiddie course for the kids. These both have ocean views. ~ Free coolers & ice to borrow during your stay ~ Free morning coffee in the lobby ~ Nice size beach towels ~ No resort fees or parking fees ~ NO high-rise style buildings- only 2 stories! ~ Concierge Holland Carter is super helpful and awesome ~ Take or leave lending library bookshelf in lobby ~ On site mini-spa- very tiny and not very posh but therapists were great! ~ Ocean views look out to the islands Lanai and Molokai ~ Close proximity to Honolua General store, Gazebo restaurant (breakfast!!) Maui Brew-Co, Roys and a handful of small sandwich, taco or coffee shops. ~ Get the full experience of all the Kapalua resort features w/o staying there!- beautiful grounds, walking path, restaurants and shops. ~ Close proximity to other great beaches and snorkel locations: Kapalua Bay, Honolua Bay, Napili Point CONS: ~ Free snorkel (No fins) - These were not great quality and gave us trouble. After one day of using them we headed to Snorkel Bobs-close by and paid the $9/day for everything- well worth it. ~ I guess its a pro that they do have a restaurant (The Sea House) on site, but we did not care for it. The Pupus (appetizers) were less than stellar and the waitstaff was constantly trying to up-sell us on more drinks and food- both when dining casually AND more formally!! It was uncalled for. ~ Lobby computers are pay-only. I thought this was a little ridiculous given that it is a pretty nice resort, and everyone needs to use them eventually to print out boarding passes. And there is NO wireless access at the resort. We only had an ipod touch with us so this was a problem. There was in-room ethernet connection if you had a laptop. ~No chaise lounge chairs allowed on the beach-only pool. For the beach they have those little low-slung beach seats which are fine but not great. Also no cabanas to speak of. ~ Hotel staff is pretty quiet and reserved. They could do a better job of promoting the daily events in the lobby. Their main method of promotion is to leave messages on your in-room phone which is annoying. ~Can be WINDY!!

This was our third trip to Hawaii and our first to Maui. We have some experience with travel in this country and others, to include a number of stays at five-star resorts. This is the finest hotel/resort we have ever stayed in. To say that about a resort like this is somewhat out of character for us because we usually seek out new hotels and the Napili Kai is an older resort, at least by Maui standards - some buildings almost 50 years old. This resort has an incredible history that overcame many challenges in its early days to become the jewel that it is today. You have watched the 60's movies that have all the cool exotic places that no longer exist and you wish you could still experience them when they were new? This is it. You almost expect the Rat Pack to walk around the corner in one of the hallways. The Napili Kai resort is immaculately maintained down to the finest detail - both buildings and grounds. There is no faded paint - every inch of the place is freshly painted. If there is a leaf on the ground in the morning, someone will have removed it by that afternoon. The grass throughout the resort (watered every day) is like a manicured putting green without a weed in it. The beach and shoreline are gorgeous - has to be one of the best in Maui. Our room was in the Puna II building, which recently underwent a multi-million dollar renovation. This building is an upgrade, but for what they charge you, it is well worth it. Full kitchen, GE Profile appliances, granite countertops, real cherry cabinets, large lanai with heavy expensive whicker cushioned furniture - I could go on, but won't. We have stayed at Conrads and Ritz-Carltons - this room was the nicest we have ever stayed in. And speaking of the Lanai and hotel in general, when they built this place in the 60's and added on in the 70's, you could almost build on top of the ocean - they can't do that anymore. Our room was just a few feet from the ocean and we went to sleep every night with the sound of ocean breaking against the rocks below our room. And although our room was an upgrade, we looked at a number of other remodeled rooms (although not remodeled to the extent of our building) in other buildings that were nice. And I think almost every room in the place has a wonderful view of the ocean. The staff is incredible and many have worked there for decades (their name tags tell you how long they have been with Napili Kai). I think one of the bartenders has been there over 30 years. Staff will bend over backwards for you. As a whole, they are the nicest, most respectful and most helpful we have ever encountered. When we arrived to check in I approached the desk staff person and told her who I was. She did not say anything and walked away. She returned moments later with a papaya drink for me and said, \"Welcome home.\" The resort advertises that it is family friendly and we found that to be the case. But what you will find here are mostly middle aged and older couples. It is a nice, quite place and if you like to let your kids run screaming through the hallways all day, then you won't be welcomed and this resort is not for you. The hotel's Beach House Restaurant has very good food and is very affordable for breakfast and lunch. Dinner at the restaurant is a more dress up affair (by Maui standards) and somewhat expensive (by my standards), but you get what you pay for and dinner is excellent. We like to explore our destinations and drove over 1,000 miles in our rental car. We found Lahaina (15 minutes from the Napili Kai) to be the most interesting and fun town on the island. Very touristy, but what isn't in Hawaii? What you will find is a beautifully picturesque town on the ocean with a lot of wonderful restaurants. The Beach Boys liked the town so much, they wrote a song about it. In reading the other reviews in TripAdvisor for the Napili Kai, I think our review is pretty consistent with other reviewers. There were a couple of reviewer comments, however, that our experience did not support. Some reviewers commented on bugs in the room. We saw very few bugs. This is a tropical climate. There are bugs in every hotel room in every hotel in Hawaii. Ask anyone who lives in this kind of climate. It is a battle you can fight, but will never win. Some complain about the regimented towel policy. You receive plastic cards that you turn in for beach towels at the beach house. You receive a towel for each card. When you turn the towel back in to the beach house, you receive your card back and when you check out they want their cards back. The resort is going to charge you for each plastic card you don't have at checkout. It is no big deal. The resort does this because if they didn't, no one would ever bring their towels back and the resort would be spending tons of money on towels. Many hotels don't even make beach towels available for you. My wife and I have stayed in many great places and at many great hotels, but have never had a desire to return to the same hotel again.

You can walk (really!) one block and be on the golf course and have to drive 10 minutes to Safeway for main grocery shopping at Lahaina(here again, no need for the bigger grocery shopping when you've just landed...do that the next day after you've rested, at Safeway ! (We found the prices really reasonable). Lots of other dining options all over and quick eat locations close as well. Tips: take basic insurance on car - some roads are tight and parking generally is tight everywhere ! do the Haleakala (?) Crater trip by car - takes 6 or 7 hours but the views from that crater of Maui and surrounds on a clear day can't be described in words. watch the traditional Hawaiian Lahau (?) In Lahaina if you don't know whether you'll have the chance to visit Hawaii again. drink pina cooladas ....these islanders REALLY know how to make them. do some snorkeling and explore a whole new world !

Here are a few examples: 1. When you check in, they give you a few plastic cards that you can exchange for beach towels. In theory, you are supposed to get the cards back when you return your beach towels. If you don't return the exact number of cards that you were given at check in, you are charged some outrageous sum per towel when you check out. Don't get me wrong, I am all in favor of conserving resources. In reality, however, some guests lose their towels and steal someone else's towel to avoid the fine. In the five days that we were there, we had our towels stolen twice. When we told the guy at the beach hut what happened, he told us: \"you are supposed to stay with your towels.\" I guess they expect you to wear the towels on your head like turbins when you go swimming. Anyway, who wants spend their vacation closely guarding a worn out beach towel? 2. The resort claims that kids eat free. But, if your child makes that mistake of ordering a \"short stack\" of 2 pancakes instead of a regular stack of 3 pancakes, they will charge you because the term \"short stack\" is used on the adult menu and includes a few nuts, while the \"stack\" of 3 pancakes is listed on the children's menu. 3. Although they advertise that all snorkeling equipment is free, this is misleading. It doesn't include fins. (We were told that, if we wanted fins, we could rent some at Snorkel Bobs.) In addition, during the first two days of our trip, we couldn't swim at the resort because of strong rip currents. Although there were other beaches nearby that were safe for swimming, the guy in the beach hut told us that they didn't like the snorkel equipment to leave the property and that it had to be returned each day by 5pm. When we finally got a mask and snorkel on our third day, the equipment was uncleaned and full of sand. 4. Although they advertise that the condos include daily maid service, there are signs in the condo stating that the maids have been instructed not to clean the kitchen (not even a glass or coffee mug) for some unexplicable reason. Finally, don't believe the Napili Kai's marketing statements and reviewers like Frommer's who claim that the Napili Kai is a real \"find\" for travelers with kids. When you enter the room, you will see literature stating something to the effect that children are expected to be under control at all times because \"many of [their] guests have passed their child rearing years and/or chosen to go on vacation without their children.\" I believe that it is self-evident that parents should monitor their children, and such statements are patronizing. There is a strictly enforced quiet time between 10 pm and 8 am because the walls in the condos are thin. Ironically, although children are expected to be seen and not heard, you will hear lawn equipment and Fox TV blaring from some condos at odd hours. The claim that there are washers/dryers in all units is false: there are coin operated laundry machines in a few buildings. These all close at 8 pm. Although they advertise that they have a Keiki Club during \"Spring Break/Easter\" and I was told that they would have this when I booked my reservation two months in advance, I was told at check in that they had decided not to do the Keiki Club that week, but that children could attend the 1/2 hour presentations on lei making, etc. There was no one under 60 at those presentations. The bottom line: If the resort wants to cater to older guests, that's fine. But, they shouldn't market themselves as being \"kid friendly.\"", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cThis is what the islands are all about.\u201d", "Author": "KamalaniCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR57184298", "Content": "My husband's family has been guests at Napili Kai Beach Resort since it was Napili Kai Beach Club.

We LOVED it. At the same time the negative reviews you see here all have a grain of truth, so just make sure Napili is what you want. Read a dozen or so reviews and you'll get the idea. It's an old-timey Maui resort that feels like it must have been here 30 years ago before the condomania. It shares one of the best beaches on the whole island with several other small resorts (hence the odd towel policy which is NO big deal.) Its all open air with nice sized rooms - all with very serviceable kitchens and every thing you need to prepare simple meals. Almost every room has a great view - even the cheap ones. The area is one of the nicest spots on the whole island - just ask the people across the street at the Ritz Carlton. The best golf course on the island - Kapalua ( home of the PGA event) is also across the street. We LOVED our room. One tip - beg borrow and steal to get on the second floor. The single biggest drawback of the place (if you choose to see it that way) is that everyone has their windows open to take advantage of the wonderful breeze, so you can hear and see more than what you would normally at a mega-resort. We loved it. As you can see from the reviews, some people don't. They ought to cross the street and stay at the Ritz. In comparison the Napili Kai is an extremely homey and fun place with wonderful help. Just super relaxing. We loved it. FYI I would call the restaurant overrated although you can't beat the view. Food in general in Maul is crazy expensive. Use your kitchen. The beach to the North (?) of the hotel has a little more surf and better snorkeling ( just walk to it across the parking lot.) There is an excellent high-end restaurant over there also - it all sits in front of the Ritz. There is a LONG ocean-front trail for you joggers. And the drive around the point is well worth it. Loved the laua in old town Lahaina. Buy book \"Maui Revealed\" for excellent travel tips. If you're adventurous all those drives (Hana etc.) are great fun. No need for 4WD (follow the book!).

As others have stated, there is no air conditioning, which isn't such a big deal at night, but during the day, it does make a difference because the humidity can be high in Maui. There is no elevator, so you schlep your bags up and down stairs, the carpets are old, worn and dirty. There are more \"rules\" than I am comfortable with having when I am staying at a resort, you have to give a key to get a towel, you have to bring the towel back or be charged $20, and that's just the beginning of the rules. In this economy, you can find a nicer place to stay at similar or better rates. However, this is a resort that obviously can please people, but it definitely is not for me.

We didn't expect the incredible view from room 77 in the Aloha building. My wife actually said \"Did they give us the wrong room?\" Wow indeed. The grounds are impeccable, with grills and picnic tables stashed away in several areas. Small swimming pools scattered throughout the resort, a large Jacuzzi tucked in a garden area. The low rise buildings blend into the grounds. The resort never felt crowded, and is definitely not suited for those seeking loud nightlife. The Sea House restaurant was fantastic. Not the cheapest Maui restaurant, download their menu from napilikai.com, but a great value for creative cuisine, and it compares quite well with the nicer places on the island for imagination and quality The Whale Watchers bar at the Sea House has one of the coolest bar views ever. Don't miss enjoying a couple of breakfasts and lunches at the Sea House as well. Absolutely the best island pancakes on Maui. Don't believe the hype surrounding the place on the other end of the beach. Napili Bay beach never has crashing waves, unless the weather is crazy. It's well protected, and great for lazy snorkeling, floating and just hanging out. Super clear water, even when it's 20 feet deep, you feel as if your feet are just skimming the bottom! The room was perfect for two people. A galley kitchen with full sized fridge, glass cooktop, and a convection microwave. My only complaint was that the cocktail glasses were too small for making ginormous Gin and Tonics. Oh, my....such a pain to have to walk all the way from the lanai to the kitchen for a refill.

The spa isn't a spa, the tennis court long gone, and it's either family time or geriatric, depending on when you visit. What people seem to miss, is the genuine, authentic ohana ambience. It has a real charm, unfound in most other places in Hawaii. The staff are loyal and long serving. There is no corporate ownership- just a bunch of shareholders who are basically trying to have a familiar comfy place to go every winter. They pour pretty much all the money earned into property maintenance and redecorating. No fancy dividends for the owners, for sure! It was built in 1960, wood frame, so that helps explain some of the deficiencies. Compare to Kapalua Bay Hotel, built ca 1982?, already torn down. Also- like the Sheraton at Black Rock, Kaanapali, being first on the block gets you pride of place. The prevailing winds are north east, so the whole property is beautifully protected by the point of land separating it from Kapalua. I recommend the Lani rooms, or Keaka for bigger units. Puna has a rocky foreshore, and is genuinely dated- though they are embarking on an upgrade to that wing now (2009). You can stay at any of the other condos on Napili Beach for a lot less than NKBR. But you are getting a quasi beach resort, not just a condo- with towel service, mini-golf, mai t'ai parties, daily maid service, restaurant and bar.

Very helpful staff, beautiful grounds, excellent beach, decent rooms. From the reviews I've read here, people that are looking for the modern, upscale Resort experience may not care much for Napili Kai, but if you're looking for a classic, old school, resort experience - Napili Kai is probably for you. One of the best things about Napili Kai is it's location - Napili Bay is protected against over development -- No building can be taller than the trees, so you won't see much in the way of modern development here. It's sort of a time capsule for a simpler, quieter time. The beach is really nice for swimming, occasionally some bigger waves but using the beach is very calm, and for the most part, sandy, particularly in the middle area. If it's snorkeling you want, a quick walk through the parking lot takes you to Kapalua Beach. There seemed to be a nice mix of retirees, families and young couples - but overall, it's a really peaceful, quiet place for the most part. We stayed in the Puna II building, set back from the beach - very secluded and quiet, with an excellent lanai, and remodeled kitchen, but no AC. Did notice a few of the \"invisible ants\" people wrote about in the reviews, but not a big problem. Also spent a few nights in the Honolua building, which is right by the beach and the main pool. Still a great view, and AC (which IS nice to have on the hotter days). Kitchen much smaller and not remodeled, but still decent enough to cook lunches and small dinners. In room Hi Speed internet access via Ethernet cable was great - wireless worked very well in the Puna II room, not so good in the Honolua building. Someone mentioned in a review that the showerheads weren't adequate to get sand off from the beach, but we had no problem with the showerheads either of us had in our rooms. Really loved breakfasts at the Sea House restaraunt, and having drinks at the bar. You can't get any closer to the beach!

In fact, we liked it a lot better than the \"fancy\" place we stayed at later in our trip in Wailea. What I liked most about the property is the fact that the buildings are all only two stories high, and the general shape of the buildings blends in nicely with the coastline. It's not one of those giant hunks of concrete stuck on a beach, which is what you get with a lot of the other hotels in Maui. I was a little nervous when I found out we were on the ground floor, as one of the previous reviewers mentioned a lack of privacy, but I think it really depends on your building. We had an ocean view studio in the Lani 2 building, and our room was completely private, tucked away behind some bushes and a grassy area where nobody walked. The room itself was very pretty, with a very comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and big, beautiful lanai looking out on the water. The kitchenette was well stocked with everything you'd need to cook meals. We were nice and cool at night with the ceiling fan and screen doors. The beach itself was a little crowded for my taste, but everybody was so happy that you couldn't help but be swept up in it, and I ended up not minding at all. The water was clear and flat while we were there, and the calm water made it a great place to bring kids (and lots of people did). We were able to do some great snorkeling, and we saw several sea turtles! If there's one negative I can think of, it's that the hotel doesn't rent umbrellas, and there's no shade on the beach in the afternoon -- and the sun is very strong. They had a couple of flimsy umbrellas that had been left by other guests, but they weren't great, and there weren't enough of them. But we managed to find some shade up on the lawn under some trees, so it wasn't too bad if you didn't mind chasing the shadows around with your chair. So if you are on the pale side like me, bring your own umbrella! It will probably be worth the money if you're traveling around to different beaches on the island anyway. We ate at the restaurant one night and thought the food was pretty good. We returned a few times to the bar for their excellent Mai Tais! We also loved the little pathway going along the rocks next to the hotel.

In Napili, no building can be taller than the palm trees. We came to Napili Kai mostly because when we were here on the last trip and saw how well it blended into its surrounding enviroment and its proximity to great snorkeling beaches. We hoped it would live up to our expectations, well it not only lived up to our expectations by the accomodations, the friendly staff, other guests and the grounds, it surpassed it. We came to spend our 30th wedding anniversary in paradise and to relax and snorkel. We are fairly low keyed people and the Napili Kai was the perfect pick for us. When we booked with Cheap Hawaii Tickets we were not sure what condo we would get but asked for a ocean front and second floor and would highly recommend that for anyone. We were lucky and got a preferred condo in the Puna II building (room 221). The view when we walked in and opened the lanai doors just blew us away, ocean everywhere and could be seen from just about anywhere in the room. We spent many hours on the lanai watching whales, turtles and people, great fun. The Puna buildings are out on the rocky point and more quiet than the beach front units which worked out fine for us, no beach, but a short walk on the path gets you to the beach. I have read where some have complained about the accomodations being dated and the ghost ants. The Puna rooms are to be updated this summer but seemed fine for us (we live in house over 100ys. old). The ghost ants were not an issue because we kept everything in the fridge or oven, plus they don't eat much anyway. The snorkeling in Napili Bay is very good and we saw turtles many times and Kapalua Bay is just a short across the parking lot and the snorkeling is also great there. Check out Honolua Store in Kapalua and Maui Tacos in Napili for good inexpensive eating options.

My family started going there over 30 years ago when my mother was a travel consultant with an agency that specialized in Hawaii. Since then, although everything around the hotel has changed dramatically (and horribly in many cases), the Napili Kai has remained virtually the same (not in a bad way). It isn't quite as family-run as it used to be, but when you arrive there is still a warm and friendly feeling--they offer you fruit juice (and they are also very happy to help you get your luggage to your room, in case you are worried about climbing the stairs). What I love most about the Napili Kai is its location: it's one of the few places on Maui (or on many of the islands) where highrises, speedboats, etc., are not permitted. (In fact the hotel's original management was also responsible for pushing for the anti-development laws that have kept the bay frozen in time.) So, if you really want a real beach vacation--i.e., sunbathing, reading books, swimming, etc.--it is perfect. But if you want night life, sensation, and easy access to other activities, it may not be the best for you. Since all I want from a Hawaiian vacation is relaxation and a little daily exercise, it is just right for me. There are other hotels along the beach, but the Napili Kai was there first and has the best situation. The bay has gentle tides and is perfectly sized for swimming laps (I think that 4 times back and forth roughly equals a mile of open water). The water is almost always beautifully clear at this end and offers plenty of interesting fish and coral reef to examine. The other reason I love the Napili Kai is that it has the feeling of an old beach club. Every time I go, I meet people who have been coming back there for years (just like my family). This year we went at Xmas, something we've always wanted to do, and the hotel was filled with big family groups and tons of kids. It was really fun to watch their antics every day. At other times, the hotel has seemed quieter and more romantic. Once we saw a couple getting married on the rocks, just a few yards from our room. Everyone on the beach broke into applause. I can't imagine this happening at a big high-rise hotel. I also think it would be a great place for a honeymoon. Re: amenities: the restaurant has never been all that great--in the past you just had to give in and accept that it was going to be kind of hokey. But on this trip, it seemed greatly improved and we really enjoyed the two dinners and one lunch we had there (order the papaya with crab salad). There is now a Costco by the airport and a local farmer's market where you can get fruit and vegetables quite cheaply. Snorkel equipment and fresh towels are available at the snack bar and I got fins from Snorkel Bob's for $8 for the week. Units can be variable, but this time we had a great one, with newly renovated kitchen and bathrooms. Everything was spotless and well-stocked and the staff is very friendly.

The kitchen came in handy for the few meals we cooked while there and the grills on the grounds worked great. We stayed in room 5.

First again, this is a great place to relax. No need to rush for poolside chairs, etc like bigger places. This really is a nice resort. Ok. Ghost ants. I read about them in the last few reviews and it's true. I came prepared though. I bought a box (four-pack) of ant traps for $4 and brought them along. There is a Walmart in Maui so no biggie if forgotten. The rooms was very nice. Oceanview, room #82. The FIRST thing I did was scour for bedbugs... there were none. Great. Next, I looked for the ghost ants. Having only seen pictures on the net, I had no idea they were so tiny! Anyway, they were on the round table where they put the nice fresh plant. They were on the kitchen counter, and the odd one on the fridge and coffee maker. This turned me off from prepping any food for using the grills outside. Too bad. I would have so used the grills... There were NO ants on the vanity area where you would put your toothbrushes etc. That's great. Ok. Here I have to say, my wife is not squeamish about the ants. I showed her and she just shrugged them off as nothing. She doesn't like spiders though. Anyway. Even for me, if they were normal sized ants, I would have immediately vacated the room. These are just little... ghosts. First thing I did then is unpack the traps. Put one on the kitchenette area countertop. One on the round table, then I put a fresh FLOWER on top of it. This is key. The ants will go over the trap to the flower, and some will go in the trap. Works great. Next, move the plant they give you someplace else... like outside. Finally, place traps from the space between the wall and the dresser leg, so if they go near the legs up the dresser, they make a stop at the \"ant hotel\". First two days, they were busy. After that, There was only the odd few left. Key thing. Keep all food in the fridge, or zipped up on the dresser. Do not leave anything on the floor you don't want to take home with you. Though I don't see it as a problem, I don't need tropical bugs hiding in the bags and such if I leave them on the floor. This is a key to going anyplace anyway, so this is no different. Ok with that out of the way, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. As long as you are prepared, nothing is a big deal.

I will list the pros and cons. We stayed 6 nights the beginning of August. Pros 1. The beach is beautiful and great for kids. 2. Kapula bay next door is also a great beach. Great for snorkeling. 3. When staying here the best rooms to book are the beachfront rooms for access directly to the beach on the bottom floor 4. Laundry facilities in each resort building unit. There is no wait (free soap but need quarters). You can easily wash clothes at night. 5. Mai Tai party (great mai tai's and even soda for kids and wine for those who do not want mai tai's. Great way to meet guest 6. Minature golf 7. Grills. They are placed around the resort and never a wait. There is one next to where the mai tai party is and is just beautiful at night to have dinner sitting outside above the bay. If renting a hotel room bring utensils for the grill. 8. The Sea House Restaurant - we enjoyed this restaurant for breakfast and dinner one night. The view is beautiful. I wish there were more choices when arriving late for something light since the snack bar is limited. We arrived around 3:30 and after unpacking went to get something to eat. We did not want a full dinner but there were not many choices except for salad. 9. Coolers are free to use at the snack stand along with snorkel masks (but should be told since I didn't know until I saw them) 10. Small store around the corner if no car 11. The refrigerator is a good size 12. The size of the bathroom is large is great for a family. 13. Very safe environment for children 14. Large closet space 15. Kids Hawaiian show 16. Internet access at the front desk lobby (I forget the cost. I think $2.00 for 5 minutes) Cons 1. The free coffee in the rooms and in the lobby is terrible. 2. For some reasons this area of Maui gets a lot of bugs. Swarms of bugs in the air during certain times was a bit annoying. I got a spider bite the first day and my leg swelled up. 3. The kids program is not run that well. We stayed here first on our trip and then moved to Kaanapali to be able to utilize the program but we could not get in 2 of days there because they only accept 8 children. When my son did get in, it was for pool games. The pool games were throw a ball in the pool and let the few kids in there use it. The counselor did not get the kids involved to play with each other. Very weak kids program. 4. Not clear on where they are hosting daily activities. I asked at the snack stand but they didn't seem to know. Unless you read the book in your room you will not find the lei making activity, etc. They should post these activities around the resort. 5. The main pool is too cold. We found one pool that was okay up by the Mai Tai function area. 6. If your room is on the second floor you have to carry your luggage up the stairs 7. Snorkel equipment masks are free but there are no fins. There should also be umbrellas for rent. Maybe they could recommend going to snorkel bob's around the corner and renting the package of two chairs/umbrella and cooler for $30.00 8. The gym is okay but a little small and hot 9. While there are candles in the bathroom for the balcony, there are no lights so you tend to not use the balcony at night. I would definitely recommend booking the ocean beach rooms. I think this may have added more enjoyment to the vacation. You can actually sit out on your balcony at night. We stayed in the garden unit hotel room. I think one of the main reasons to stay here would be the beach or snorkeling at Kapula Bay. We had a car but I found myself getting a little bored by the fourth day. Especially when there was a tropical storm with blowing winds and we could not sit out one day on the beach. We enjoyed our stay but I think some improvements for the price could be made. Possibly some children's games would be a nice addition.

I just reminded myself we did book a condo to save some money on meals to keep in kitchen and maybe use the b-que grill for dinner. (with a family of 5, meals in Maui can cost a small fortune). That didn't work out so good. The food we bought and kept in the kitchen area, had bugs in it that came from our room. We opened the cabinets and there were small (ants?) everywhere. Frustrated, we went down to the SeaHouse Restaurant on beach for dinner. My iced tea has some kind of weird slime in it, they took it away and apologized. Found a couple bugs in basket of rolls, and the food wasn't very good. Did I mention the bathroom had mildew on ceiling of shower. I just wanted to quickly shower and get out quickly, not a good feeling when you are paying $500 a night. On top of that we paid an extra $400 to guarantee a room with A/C. That's crazy! I heard some rooms are upgraded, but ours #204 in the Puna building was not!! Then we get up the next morning, go to the patio door thinking we are having a major storm, and notice a sprinkler must have broke and is spraying all over our patio door and lanai. Stinks especially when you have towels and swim wear out to dry, that is now soaked. I spoke with manager, and he let us out of last 2 nights there and we were able to get a room at the Hyatt, much better by the way. When we thought that bad experience was over, the next day, we find out our bank account is empty. Napili Kai decided to take out almost $3000. for no apparent reason.

I demanded to speak to someone as to why they took out any money from our account because our room for the 2 nights was pre paid several months in advance, and only came to $470 a night not $3000. They gave us the run around, until we took a drive over there, and my husband, spoke with the manager, that supposively was gone until Friday. They did refund us the $2900, but are still curious why??? If you are staying in this area, I do recommend Kapalua Bay. It is beautiful and not very crowded. The guys snorkeled and had luck while we played on our boogie boards. If you want a nice place, we recommend the Hyatt on Kaanapali, we paid $450 a night, and our last 2 nights in Maui, we splurged at the Grand Wailea, but worth every penny, gorgeous and the kids had a blast at the pools.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Beach and Great Spa\u201d", "Author": "cazile", "ReviewID": "UR18039508", "Content": "A serious kudos to the onsite spa.

We returned yesterday and I have to say that we were so sad to leave Napili Kai! We have been to Bermuda, other places in Hawaii, the Caribbean, etc., and I think that Napili Bay is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in my life! I don't understand why Kapalua Bay (a 30 sec. walk from Napili) wins the 'Best Beach' awards - IMO, Napili Bay beats it hands down! The bay is a beautiful stretch of sandy shoreline with sandy bottom bay for about 50 feet out into the water - then you reach the first line of reef where you can snorkel and see all sorts of fish - go out to the '2nd line' of reef and you'll find the little pocket where a group of 4-5 sea turtles congregate (just look for the area where groups of snorkelers remain for long periods of time!) I love to read on the beach, but the view of the crystal water with the steep green crags of Molokai in the background was incredibly distracting - I kept looking up to admire the view! As to the Napili Kai Resort itself, it is not fancy. No one is taking your drink order on the beach, there is no nightlife, and our room (in the Puna Point building, #207) was a little 'dated'. However... the room was clean and comfortable and the staff was warm and friendly. The free coffee in the lobby in the a.m. was a treat, and be sure to check the ground under the mango tree when you go get your coffee for any mangoes that have dropped during the night - they are so delicious!! The resort is only 2 stories high, and feels very intimate. Everyone I spoke with there was a repeat guest (and that says a lot right there!) The grills out by the pools are great for cooking dinner, and everyone is incredibly cooperative about sharing them. We didn't think the beach was overly crowded, and the hotel beach chairs and towel service was great. To sum up - if you are looking for a luxury vacation with all the high-level amenities, then Napili Kai is probably not for you. If you are looking for a family-friendly, clean, comfortable resort on the most amazing beach, you will not be disappointed! I had looked at places on Kaanapali Beach when researching our vacation, and after 'strolling' the Kaanapali Beach walkway with our kids one day, I was thanking my lucky stars that we wouldn't have been able to afford a 'parking lot' view room there - so crowded, noisy, etc. Napili Kai was quiet, beautiful, and we had an ocean-front room that fit 5 people comfortably for $470/night. If I am ever lucky enough to return to Maui, we will return to Napili Kai!

We are used to staying in 4-5 star resorts but decided to go with a condo this time since we had the baby with us. We stayed in the Lani II Building on the suggestion of the reservations agent. I specifically stated that I wanted an updated unit and not a dated worn out looking one. The room was on the second floor of the Lani II building which is the one further back from the ocean. It had a gorgeous view and a lanai that spanned the length of the living room and the bedroom with sliding glass doors in both rooms. The condo seemed fairly updated (though relatively cheaply) and the bathroom was clean though far from luxurious. Also, it was nice to have a second mini bathroom with a separate shower. The cottage cheese ceilings made it look a little dated but I guess that's being a little nit picky. When we initially checked in I noticed that the railing on the balcony was pretty wide and possibly unsafe for our child. Before we unpacked I called down to the front desk to ask if we could stay in the Lani I building instead which I could see had more secure balconies and I specifically asked for a first floor unit. The person I spoke with seemed so clueless and said she would call me back to let me now about availability. We waited in limbo for about an hour before we realized she was not going to call back. We just stayed super vigilant when our little one was on the balcony and never really got to relax and enjoy the view. If you have a small child, ask for a lower level unit or a unit with glass balcony instead of the metal railings. Overall the unit was basically clean. (Only found one pincer bug on the toilet and two geckos near the ceiling in the living room. No roaches.) Baby items were provided including a crib with bedding, a diaper pail, and a high chair. When we went down to the pool area, they gave our little one a sand bucket and shovel and an umbrella and the service down there was very nice and friendly. It is a family friendly area and that, along with the location, are the biggest pluses. Two quick notes: We both had massages at the \"spa.\" The massages were good but unfortunately it was the massage therapist's last day. There really is no spa to speak of, just a room where you get a massage. No showers, no hot tub, no sauna. I had a scrub and left with grains of sugar all over me because they really are not equipped to do a real scrub like you'd get at a spa. It's ok as long as you know what you're getting (or not getting). The kicker is that they charge just as much as a nice hotel spa. Their prices should be lower to reflect the lack of amenities. Stay away from the SeaHouse Restaurant unless you are just going for cocktails (the view is great). Ordering anything more there is not a good idea. The first time we went there I ordered chicken tenders for our daughter and as I was cutting them up for her I noticed they were totally raw inside. Thank goodness I hadn't given her any yet. The rest of the food was barely edible and not tasty. We stayed away until the last day when we decided to give it another shot this time for breakfast. I ordered a bowl of fruit for my daughter. I tasted the cantalope and it was totally spoiled and disgusting. I brought it to the waitress's attention. She brought another bowl of fruit saying, \"This was made yesterday so it should be better.\" When was the first bowl made???? In my book, stuff like fruit salad should be made daily. She acknowledged that the first bowl of fruit tasted like it had vinegar in it. Both times, the servers acted really blase about the food being below par - like this was a regular occurrence. I am not sure we would go back to Napili Kai. If we do, it will be with a lower expectation and it will be strictly for the convenience of staying in a condo and the beauty of the beach.

We checked in April 28th (there until May 5th) and the front desk lady was very gracious. She gave us a bunch of information including a nice congrats note on our marriage (also got a bottle of champagne in the room!). And we got a free Expedia beach bag that was very helpful. Our room was an ocean view, second floor, king bed, studio in the Lani II building. When we got to our room, we knew we were in paradise. The view was amazing! I would definitely request ocean view Lani II if you can. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have AC but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it (and my new husband likes to be cool). The winds were enough. The bath was beautifully done with granite and the sink and closet were separate from the shower and toilet which is nice. The kitchen also was upgraded with granite and new appliances. The main d\u00c3\u00a9cor was old Hawaiian and was perfect. Comfy bed and pillows. The lanai was awesome - large and includes lounge chairs and regular chairs. And we could hear the ocean waves. That was the best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going to sleep hearing the waves. So miss that! We loved our breakfasts at the Sea House restaurant. We thought they were reasonable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about $25 for the both of us. They were very filling so we basically ate breakfasts and dinners the whole trip. We never had dinner there at the restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the go too much. The view from the tables up front is awesome! The Napili Kai beach is wonderful. While we were there though, there were HUGE waves coming in and they had rip tide and jelly fish warnings so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to swim or snorkel (this was the same up and down the Maui coast). By the fourth day, things had calmed down. Unfortunately they were still rough enough to take my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new wedding band. If someone finds it, please let me know! haha. It was great being able to get fresh towels and the beach chairs when you want. Oh and every night when the sun was setting they blew a conch shell and the tiki torches were lit. Very cool. We only had one problem with loud kids. Our last night, there was a baby next door to us who was screaming all night. And since there is no AC and the rooms are all open, we could hear her. That was kind of a bummer. But it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruin the stay that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for sure. Other things we loved: the beach path, the landscaping, the cleaning crew, pineapple and juice everyday at 10am, the shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel (you can buy these in the cute gift shop BTW), being in a quiet area, the parking (plenty), proximity to Lahaina and other POI, and the pool (great view) and Hankipanki whirlpool. Oh and the cleaning crew helped a lot when we just needed some cokes. They told us where their pop machine was! Maui was a dream and Napili Kai added to that dream.

But, the lanai itself was only separated from the neighbors by simple screen (if you booked two adjacent rooms, you could have opened the screen to have one very large lanai, which could be nice), This was a little uncomfortable if you both happened to be out at the same time. It is non-smoking, even on the lanai, which was a huge plus. I would not recommend the on-site restaurant, The Sea House. We went there for afternoon drinks/snacks. The food was okay, but the drinks were very watered down and the wait staff was incredibly rude and slow. And, of course, everything was very over-priced.

The oceanview room on the first floor of the hotel portion was large, clean and the nicest of any I had visited in all of our three Maui trips. As mentioned before parking is a serious challenge and the spaces are almost too small to exit your car. Morning began the downturn with the oceanview being a long way from the blue and behind the striped gazebo you see on the webpage. But the worst was to come.

We just got back yesterday and we miss it already despite the torrential downpours that dogged our visit. The property is very well maintained and the view from our 2nd floor ocean view studio was magnificent. Our room was #326 in the Lani II unit. The king bed was very comfy and felt similar to Hilton's Sweet Dreams Bed or Westin's Heavenly Bed. The full kitchen was absolutely fantastic -- especially due to the temporary closure of the Sea House restaurant for refurbishing. No matter, we only made breakfast in the room once and ate out for all the other meals. The huge bathroom with marble accents was very nice. I loved the Shoji sliding screen doors from the lanai which gave the room a very elegant pan-Pacific look and feel. The rooms have no air conditioning but utilize a combination of Hampton Bay ceiling fans, open and closeable shutters and the Shoji to keep the room comfortable. The feel of the ocean air blowing into the room in the evening was so peaceful and relaxing. The beach was beautiful and had that private feel you don't find at many beach resorts. In the nightstand you'll find a small book you can take home with you which details the history of the Napili Kai. It's very interesting and will give you an informed perspective and respect for the property as you stroll its grounds and play in the surf. My one complaint which I believe has been mentioned by other reviewers is there is no lobby or beach bar. It kind of dampens the laid-back, beach resort experience when you can't order a Pi\u00c3\u00b1a Colada, Mai Tai or Blue Hawaiian while basking in the sun. All you get are these signs: NO LIQUOR ON BEACH or something like that. Still, guests strolled the beach in the evening sipping wine or champagne and seemed to be left alone by employees and security.

Our first issue, albeit a relatively minor one, was the parking. The parking spots are quite narrow and require you to squeeze into a spot, which isn't very comforting when you're driving a rented car. The other thing we noticed about the parking lot, which was a far bigger issue, was that they had a large garbage bin located there, which was also not far from our room assigment. This would probaly help explain the tons of flying bugs we had to wade through to get to our room. We were picking bugs off our clothes when we got to our room. Speaking of our room, it was more like a motel room than a pricey ocean view room at a Maui \"resort\". The furnishings were outdated and \"cheesy\", for lack of a better word. What's worse, our so called \"ocean view\" was actually a view of some kiddie golf course, a crowded pool and some big orange and yellow striped tent. If you stood out on the lanai and angeled yourself a certain way you could catch a sliver of ocean, but this was hardly what I had in mind for an \"ocean view\" room. Plus, standing out on the lanai was a rather unplesant experience since it was also inundated with flying bugs. Needless to say, we were less than thrilled with the accomodations already. At this point we went to the front desk to voice our concerns and, although polite, they made no effort what-so-ever to accomodate us. To be honest we weren't all that interested in staying there any longer anyway so we didn't really make much of an argument out of it either. We promptly made other arrangements at the Sheraton, which we wound up paying for out of pocket, and checked out right then. I could not in good conscience recommend this place to anyone, unless of course you're into insects, paying resort rates for a motel room, are very open minded on the meaning of ocean view, and don't mind a complacent staff.

I loved that everything other than food was included -snorkel equip, putters, parking, hula lessons, manager's cocktail hour,etc. We also did the Monday night putting party for adults where they serve $0.50 cocktails - we met lots of nice people and continued to see them throughout our stay. I have stayed at many hotels lately where I felt nickle and dimed (resort fees, parking,etc) so it was very refreshing to have everything included. Most of the people staying while we were there were repeat guests and I can see why! My family of four stayed here a week beginning the Saturday after Thanksgiving. We had a 1 bedroom ocean front suite in the Puna Point building. We had amazing views of the sunset - we had a 2nd floor room that was practically sitting on top of the water. This is the furthest building from the beach/restaurant but the walk to the beach was along the bay on a lava rock path and we didn't mind it.(If you have children 3 or under, this is not a good walk for you). I also liked that the buildings in all of Napili Bay-not just Napili Kai- are all low rise (looked like 3 or 4 stories)- it just enhanced the low key feeling of the place for me. The room itself was nothing fancy - but it was clean and I loved having a second bathroom, not to mention the extra space that comes with having a bedroom and a living room. They were renovating some of the units in the Lani Building while we were there - they looked nice - new appliances and granite countertops,etc. Our kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. We swam in the pool at our building most days and only saw one other person the whole time - this is likely due to the fact that the week we were there is one of the lowest occupancy periods of the year. The pools aren't anything like a resort pool - no water slides, etc. they're basically like a pool you'd find at a condo. The beach was great and having chairs there for guests to use was nice. I never felt like I had to run to the beach in the morning to reserve a spot. I liked the proximity of the beach to the bar and the snack shack. My children's (ages 6,5) thought the best part was the putting green and we played every day. We also went to the hula show that the foundation does once a week. Was enjoyable and our kids loved it but don't go expecting a Broadway show. They invited the kids on stage to hula also which was fun for them. The staff were great. The daily talks they gave on the Hawaiian culture were very informative. It seemed that most of the staff have worked there a very long time which says alot.

We stayed from 12.2606 - 1.4.07. The weather was not bad. We had some rain. The temperature reached 84 degrees during some days. Our room was adequate and the view enjoyable. The price is expensive but Maui is expensive -- especially the time of year that we are able to go. The resort is supposed to loan snorkel equipment but refused the day my daughter wished to go into the bay. She had to go elsewhere to rent snorkel gear. It was implied that the water was murky so there could be the \"s\" word. Did not hear this from any other place though. The drinks ordered from the bar were not too exciting. Don't drink margaritas in Hawaii! Ordered a blended margarits and it was handed to me already separated. The bartender did not know how to run the blender to blend the drink. The main problem we had was with our booking agency, The Visitor Center. I would never use them again. Whatever could go wrong did. It was difficult communicating and many errors were made. We were talked into one booking with multiple families. Don't ever do this!!! Big mistake and no accountability will ever be taken by The Visitor Center. The other people we were traveling with happen to call the airlines to see where we would be sitting. The Visitor Center never bothered to reserve seats for us. We then thought we should do further checking and called Napili Kai Beach Resort ourselves. They had us staying with the wrong people. They had my husband staying with the other person's husband and the other wife staying with me. We were able to resolve this error after we arrived. Unfortunately, we had to cancel one person due to an injury. My mom is 84 years old and fell. But the time of year we made the reservations, The Visitor Center makes no changes AT ALL. We, fortunately, took out cancelation insurance with Travelguard. We are still waiting for reimbursement from Travelguard because they have to wait for confirmation from The Visitor Center. It has probably been three months since the cancellation process for my mother started. Again, it is all being held up by The Visitor Center. The person we originally booked with is no longer there. He was the one who pushed for us to have one booking. In retrospect, I don't know how I could have been so foolish. If you make one change (when changes are even allowed), the penalty is $100 per person. Another reason it does not make any sense at all to do a multiple booking. If you wished to upgrade a car, the cost would be $100 person. So if you made a group reservation for 7 people, wham!!! $700.00. I made several calls to The Visitor Center while in Maui. The response that I got from them was to write a letter - so here's your letter. I have sent many an email! Outside of the problems we had with the Visitor Center, you just cannot help but love Hawaii. We snorkeled in Napili Kai Bay and saw great sea life - right there! We saw turtles and many different small fish. We had some great dives with Lahaina Divers. We dived the back side of Molokini (my favorite), we also dived Cathedral II, and other sites. Lahaina Divers' did a great job - good people. For the price, $300 a day, I expected a little more. We had an ocean view studio.

Neither of us had ever been to Hawaii before, and friends had told us that we needed to go to Maui and stay at Napili Kai because it was how Hawaii was meant to be! Using my frequent flyer miles, we were able to fly first class both ways on United from LAX (nonstop). That was a perfect beginning to the trip. Once in Maui, we rented our car from Dollar (a Chrysler Sebring) and made a stop at Costco. I highly recommend going to Costco prior to getting to Napili Kai if you are looking to save some money. Check-in was a breeze, and they upgraded us to a corner room in the newer part of the property. All I can say is that this room was simply amazing. 20yards to the water, 3min walk to the sandy beach, unobstructed views...it doesn't get much better than that. Beach is perfect for Snorkeling and relaxing. They rent everything at the beach for free...so snorkels, masks, chairs, towels...you name it. We rented an ice chest for the entire time we were there, and brought our own drinks down to the beach, and took it with us in the car. If you are looking for some good Sushi while you are there, try Sansei @ The Kapalua Shops. It's about a 5minute walk up the road, and they have the best Sushi i've ever had. We ate there twice and wanted to go back more! I could go on and on about this place, but you have to see it to believe it. Just a few things to help you while you are there... 1) Go grocery shopping before you get there. The rooms have full-size fridges, microwaves, stove and oven. If you are looking to save some money, this is the way to go. We ate every breakfast and lunch in the room, and only ate out for dinner...it saved us some serious $$$$$. 2) Go down the road to the Shell station at Kahana and buy some inflatable rafts at their mini-mart. They are only a few bucks, but it's so relaxing to float around the bay on these. When it's time to go, donate them to someone else who's just getting there. 3) We rented a convertible Chrysler, and loved every second of it. Don't worry about Valet parking...they have plenty of parking right outside the rooms at no charge. 4) If you've never been to Hawaii, you should really see a Luau. We walked up the road to the Ritz Carlton, and it was one of the best dinners we have ever had. All the food and booze is included, so All you can eat, and all you can drink!

We stayed in an ocean view studio that was almost like beach front. This resort depends largely on the Trade Winds for its airconditioning as most of the accomodations are without air. To pick up airconditioning we would have had to downgrade to a hotel style room with a garden view but after traveling almost 6000 miles we chose th view over the airconditioning. Although this turned out to be acceptable there were times when it was quite sticky. The resort provided us with an extra fan which did help a little. This resort is immaculate, extremely well maintained and friendly. We were there for 4 nights from 7/23/06 to 7/27/06. To acheive the best views you need to be on the 2nd level of the complex which we were and the view was breathtaking! This resort is very much geared to famlies although this did not detract from our stay. Breakfasts at the Sea House Restaurant were very good and reasonable for Hawaii and averaged about $12.00 per person including Omelets, macadamia pancakes etc. The front desk recommended a wonderful Northern Italian restuarant called Vino's. We had dinner for 4 including wine for about $50.00 per person including tax and tip. (All entrees were excellent) The atmosphere was very classy and the service was great. We did the dinner cruise on the Spirit of Lahina (a catamaran) which well worth the cost of about $70.00 per person plus tip. The food was very good and the service great for this type of adventure. We highly recommend this activity. We also did the Luau at the Feast of Lei Lei which was very nice but a bit pricey at $105.00 per person plus tip. What made this Luau exceptional was 1. no waiting in line (reserved seating) 2. Limited to 150 people 3. a beautiful setting and a great show. The food was very authentic and not always to our taste but we really have no complaint. There are lots of Luaus available in different price ranges but we recommend that you be sure to get reserved seating (not wait in line) at private tables, as at Lei Lei, in a beautiful setting for a great show. Ultimately this was worth the price as well. We did drive the road to Hana with friends but to appreciate it you must commit at least 10 hours and you may want to stay over night in Hana which is in the middle of \"no where\" which is as the locals prefer it. It is a very slow winding trip with at least 54 1 lane bridges and 150 hair pin turns. Although the actual trip is 37 miles most of the time you are driving at 10 to 15 miles an hour. You can get a bit car sick so be prepared. To get the most out of the trip you will be making many stops and need to hike to many of the attractions.

Let me begin by saying, this is the first time I have never found fault with a property we have stayed at in all our travels, however I felt it only fair to others incurring this expense to share our findings. This property is beautiful, well manicured & maintained with lovely vegetation and a lovely stretch of beach. Additionally the 18 hole putting green is well manicured,and was enjoyed by all. The unheated pools were always clean, and always quiet. The workout room was quiet & nicely equipped for a resort of this size. The Sea House restaurant on the property served decent fare. As for the accomodations, we were sadly disappointed. Although we didn't have plans to spend much time in our room, we were paying a fair amt. at $500 cdn/night (taxes in), and had hoped they would be nice. Our room was furnished with VERY modest furnishings (think: motel 8): standard beds, bamboo dresser, laminate/bamboo tables, painted clapboard ceilings (with holes), musty smelling carpet, and the entire unit had an intense smell of mold throughout. The staff recognized that the room smelled of mold on our arrival, and tried to to alleviate it with the use of ionizers and airfesheners but unfortuantely these were unable to remove it. According to two of the staff we met, a number of units in our bldg had ongoing problems with mold related to a problematic airconditioning system - they mentioned 4 units that were badly affected, ours being one of them. This was very evident not only because of the smell, but the visible mold on the ceiling tiles all around the airconditioning vents. On the third day, the a/c vent was leaking lots of water all over the floor, and on our clothing. Maintenance came and spent 3.5 hrs draining it and drilling to stop it from leaking. This worked to stop the leeking and the moldy smell seemed a little less strong, but still prevalent throughout the unit. We have travelled extensively throughout the Caribbean and are quite comfortable with the characteristic musty island smells that tropical climates have, however this was not remotely the same - this was a strong MOLDY smell. We requested a room change, however unfortunately all the rooms in the Lahaina and Honolua buildings were at full occupancy, so this request was unable to be met. Additionally, the neighbouring resorts were also at full capacity so we were unable to move. We made the best of it, however it was upsetting that for the amt. of money this resort charges, that our room wasn't even comfortable to be in. Thank goodness for the lanai which we actually contemplated sleeping on to get away from the smell. So, although the resort has lovely grounds, the price of the rooms in no way reflects the quality of accomodations. We met many wonderful guests at the Napili Kai. In fact, most every one we met were either shareholders, or friends/family of shareholders, and had all been there many times. I can see how this property would hold dear to all those who have shared years of family memories there -nostalgia. It truly does have that \"OLD HAWAII feel to it - translation 70's feel -and that can be quite charming. It's was nice to be apart from the highrises, and shopping areas. In fact we were looking forward to that. All units however should have the same quality of accomodations, and these should be in line with the price. At $500.00 cdn/night - this hotel lacks the lustre that you would expect for a hotel in this price range. Addtitionally, because this property is well frequented by its many shareholders and their family/friends, I have to question whether the general public get the least choice rooms in the room assignments. We booked our vacation 71/2 months ahead of time, and at the time of booking were told there was a lots of availability...Bottom line, No rooms should have mold problems. Those rooms with such should be pulled from inventory until their problems are properly fixed. It would have been far nicer to be told ahead of time that there were no available rooms at the Napili Kai and find something else, than to travel half-way accross the world to be told - sorry your room smells strongly of mold - we've had a problem with that, but it's all we have. My advice is this - if you have your heart set on staying here, and you're not a shareholder, definitely pay the extra $300.00 U.S. to secure a \"nice\" room - if you can find where that one exists. In the end, we wouldn't consider staying here again at this price, even if the mold/air conditioning issues were resolved. The units were modest at best, and the managements minimal attempts at ensuring guest comfort were disappointing.", "Date": "March 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cTropical Paradise-Great Escape!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4623861", "Content": "My son and I stayed in an ocean front, second floor unit and we were very pleased with it.

It seems like the first thing you talk about with the other guests is where you live and how far you traveled. It's almost like a contest to see who traveled the farthest. There were many excursions to choose from and the resort's consierge was a tremendous help (thanks again Gwendolyn). We booked five different exciting things to do during our nine day visit to Maui.

If you're bringing older kids or none at all (although beware of tons of rug rats - the place is teaming with them) your viewpoint might be different. Here's my first bit of advice about the Napili Kai - choose your room wisely. Because, while overall it is a nice place with beautiful landscaping and an attractive beach, there are differences in buildings and rooms. Which means you should a)know what you want and b)ask for it specifically. There's Ocean Front which means butting right up against the ocean (but NOT on the beach) and Ocean View which means you may see all or part of the ocean, but it's doubtful if you will hear the waves and Beach Front which means you should be able to walk just a few steps out of your room to the beach (but may or may not see it from your lanai). Confused? So was I. But these are very important points to understand, because the rooms are VERY expensive for what you get. We ended up in Puna Point, the very farthest building from the beach/restaurant/stuff. It was nice and secluded, but it was either a very rocky ocean path (nice, but they close it at night and not good if you have a small kid or trouble walking) or you had to weave your way through other buildings and the parking lot. And here's something else they don't tell you. Some of the ground floor units are NOT on the ground - they are elevated and do not open out onto the grass. This means you have the worst of both worlds when you are in a ground floor unit - no freedom to just walk out your lanai to the grounds and no great view, like the 2nd story units. So, in my opinion, avoid the bottom units unless it opens directly to the ground. Again, to me, this is a big thing when you bring a small kid. Another point about Napili Kai is there is a difference in the furnishings in some units. Ours was very utilitarian, but our friend's was furnished better with art on the walls, ceiling fans, and fresh flowers. We also, ended up looking at the pool which was brightly lit at night. And our ocean front view was obstructed by a short, stubby palm tree. Getting the idea we didn't like our room? (#207 in case you want to be sure not to ask for that one). Otherwise, it was a nice place. And one day when we where there a school of about 10 dolphins hung out in the bay for at least 6 hours. People went swimming with them and we could see them jumping and spinning from our lanai (finally, something good about #207!) Overall, here are the pros, in my opinion: * Beautiful place, sort of old school charm * Nice people * Decent food at the restaurant * Good beach * Four pools, one for each building * Snack bar that makes boozy beverages (although technically you're not supposed to drink them on the beach) * Beach towels, chairs, snorkels etc. available for free * Free Mai Tais on Wednesdays from 5:30 - 6:30 * Lots of 1 bedrooms have 2 bathrooms * Dophins (not a regular occurance, I'm told) Cons: * Very pricey for a very basic unit (no dishwashers) * Odd layout of buildings means walking through parking lot * \"Stocked\" kitchens means plates/utensils only. Salt and pepper are there, but you have to buy everything else * Some units are better than others and since a lot of the people here have been coming for years (25, 30 etc) they know which ones to ask for. Newbies get last picks. * See above for more specifics Generally speaking, we had a very nice time.

First off mid April - early June is the best time to go to Maui because the crowds are less and the hotel offers every 5th night free. We had an oceanfront studio with a fabulous view. We saw turtles, a whale in the distance and even a school of dolphins all from our lanai. We could also see snorkelers because the rocks by the ocean front rooms offer some of the best snorkeling in that area. No need for snorkel trips you have it all right there. Ok, let's talk about the room. Our kitchen was fully stocked with a full sized fridge, all the utensils and cookware we would need. You are responsible for cleaning the dishes (no dishwasher). The only drawback was there were some small ants, so be aware of that. Nothing that really bothered us but you didn't want to leave any open food on the countertop. The rest of the room was standard but the view from the lanai and the A/C was worth the extra cost. The first evening we left the door open. It wasn't necessarily hot but its not the coolest of breezes. Another couple we met complained about the lack of A/C in there room and they were from Phoenix! So it must have been somewhat hot in there. If your looking for a friendly, calm beach with a small crowd then Napili beach is for you. It is shared with about 7 hotels so you mainly see patches of groups on the beach. On several occasions we went out at around 8 am and practically had the beach to ourselves as there were only 2-3 other people as we strolled along the sand. This beach was the best out of all of the beaches that we went to (The beach at the Ritz-Carlton is terrible - far from the hotel, windy and kinda dirty, Kaanapali Beach is nice but incredibly crowded with no shade - I'd hate to see this area at peak season, Kapalua Bay was nice but small and also a bit windy). The reviews were accurate in that most of the people staying were return visitors. Almost every couple we met had been there previous times, some coming every year for the past 15-30 years. Because of that there is a real feeling of community. If you hang around the lobby for a bit chances are you will end up in several conversations and making a new friend before you head back to your room. The first night we ate at the Sea House and the food was great although a bit pricey (we had two appetizers a piece and two drinks and the bill was $70!). Some of the things that I didn't know but I wish I did: -Internet was about $2 for 10 minutes. So if you plan on checking email prepare to pay or bring your own laptop. -Cingular works fine throughout most of Maui -It really is cold at the top of Haleakala (Bring gloves, a hat and a warm jacket) -The closest thing you come to a continental breakfast at Napili Kai are pineapple chunks - delicious but can run out quickly and they only serve it for a half hour from 10:00am - 10:30am -This may sound harsh but the $20 donation and time to watch the children's show could be better spent elsewhere. Unless you really really want to support or see the kids I'd pass. -You don't get leis when you get off the airplane Hope this helps. Overall, this place is great.

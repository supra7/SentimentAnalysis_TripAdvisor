Pros of the accommodations: room was spacious and included fridge and microwave, free breakfast was decent, the location is convenient with plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby, not that far from major attractions.

We had a lightbulb out and as soon as I mentioned it, a maintenance person was up to change it. Nice big pool that adults and kids loved. The front desk personnel were very nice and helpful. The one negative about the hotel is some of the guests are very rude in leaving their dirty breakfast plates and cups on the tables and just get up and leave a mess. It doesn't get cleaned up right away and is a bit unpleasant to other guests. We, along with some other guests did complain but since they said they were understaffed, it took a while before the tables were cleaned. Other than that, it was a great stay.

Not any more. I am not sure if the management has changed but the service quality dropped, the cleanliness is very bad now... When booked the hotel, I have personaly contacted hotel by mail with request to get room in top floor,facing to the pool. Upon arrival, a night clerk give me room in ground floor, despite the fact it was obvious that there is a lot free rooms. I asked again for 3rd floor, I god a key for 2nd floor.. ??? OK, it was 2 AM, after journey from Miami I had no mood for any more discusion. Once comming to the room, we realized that this is in the back of the hotel, facing to a night club. In 2 AM there was a loud music that would not allow you sleep correctly. So I get back to reception, asking for another room (I see that room I want is free becouse curtains was off). Once gettting this room, when we came to the room, we realized that room was not cleaned, there was food on the table, wet towels, dirty toilet. So, AGAIN, I had to go to reception to get another (fourth.. ) room. Once I claimed the issue with 3rd room, we got a final room - again in 2nd floor instad of requested 3rd floor - there was a lot free rooms in 3rd floor.. JUST TERRIBLE!!! In the room, it was obvious that it was quickly cleaned, but still I would not say it was really clean. Finaly, we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and then left to another place. Summary - you will not die in this hotel, in general you will recieve an average service, but nothing more. They had been far better. Just a note - when I checked in, I saw a screensawer of computer in reception - saying - \"we\u00b4re number 29 in Orlando, lets be number one\" - guys.. sincerly..

I know the heavy humidity and searing sun really make exterior painted surfaces look bad--- but they look extra bad here. Dirty-- very dirty and bad house keeping. My son dropped a chip in the living area. It remained there during our entire stay.--- It is almost like this place operates on 2 different budgets. The \"Suits\" have given them all the best stuff. The local management is either inept or does not have the funds to do day to day care. Our experience: We arrived a couple hours early and they offered to upgrade us to a \"Kid Suite\"-- cool The kid Suite is a \"home made\" partition that has a bunk and a small single bed in a \"pen\" that has been sectioned off in a regular room. Not a bad idea-- the kids have their own TV-- but the cheap execution is not attractive--- The KId TV remote had no batteries and the cable channels have recently changed--- there were Channels I would rather my kid not have access to. They will hit you up for a timeshare deal when you get your \"parking pass\" but it is not obnoxious. Breakfast was a decent spread for a European-- lacking for American tastes. (but dang, the area is really pretty) overall--- the reviews here seem a bit harsh. Once you are in your room things are fine. For breakfast think a step or 2 below the Holiday Inn Express. The TV, sink and fridge/microwave areas are top notch.

We booked the baymont through priceline and paid 355$ for 7 nights, being that we have a 2 year old and 5 year old we have to travel on a budget so I thought this was a great price. The Baymont is a older motel, located on the far end of 192 around the 15 mile marker, your looking at about a 10-20 minute drive to disney depending on red lights and traffic, but we didnt mind the drive cause this gave you options of places to eat and shop, and believe me there are plenty of choices. There is a super walmart, about 2 blocks away from the motel and a super target not too much farther. The motel was fairly nice and quiet, the front desk clerk on check inn seemed like she was having a bad night, but other than that check in only took a minute or two. The motel offers a free contenital breakfast that ends at 10, has the standard cereal,muffins donuts fruits belgian waffle maker orange and apple juice.The beds were semi-comfortable, but the pillows were horrible, but a quick trip to the walmart fixed that. The bathroom was clean, as well as the beds. The rooms come with a fridge,microwave,sink, and coffee maker. My daughters and I did take advantage of the pool after long days in the park. House keeping was excellent, we come home everyday to fresh towels and they even took the time to straighten up our daughters playpen and fold her blankets and cover up her little baby doll. One night we did come in and we were short a blanket, but went down to the front desk and they had it fixed within a couple of minutes. all in all we had a wonderful stay. I only have a few minor gripes, and few reccomendations..1) Get some mosquito control around the swimming pool, i know this is florida and we have mosquitos, but them things were flying hypedermic needles. 2.) Its not mentioned but theres appearently a small airport behind the hotel somewhere, you hear the planes outside, but while in the room I never noticed them. 3) When exiting the motel its one way so you have to go down and bang a u turn at the light, which can take a bit if the traffic is bad, so there are some parking lots you can miander through, desserted resteraunt,bravo supermarket, then the days inn and it brings you out at the light 4) not all the rooms have big flat screens as mentioned in the description, this is appearently limited to the suits, but the rooms have a large box style TV. ... so hopefully this is helpful. Check out went really smooth and I have no major complaints.

My only complaints would be that the service was definitely lacking, but we did not complain because we could not expect much for what we paid. Some examples of lack of service were: I had to ask and get from the front desk toilet paper twice. The maids left the roll with about 1/4 of the roll remaining without leaving an extra roll. One day the maids left us no towels, so I had to ask one of the maids I saw on another floor for towels. They did not replenish the paper cups, condiments or coffee/tea for the coffee maker. Also, the free continental breakfast was definitely lacking. We got there by 8 am and most items were out . The variety of food was not great - very little fruit and no yogart, but again we did not complain due to the price. We simply bought breakfast food for the room and occasionally grabbed a bowl of cereal, coffee and juice at the breakfast room. Also, the hotel was pretty busy and filled with a variety of kids teams, so at times it was very loud and kept us awake.

We selected the jacuzzi room and do not recommend the jacuzzi for anyone other than a solo small adult or a pair of young kids. It worked fine, but was not much bigger than a regular bathtub.

All of this would have been just fine with me because I don't usually let things bother me but to top it all off after I left as I was looking through my baggage I came to realize that my iPod and noise canceling headphones had been taken from my baggage during my stay and therefore I will never be returning to this hotel because I don't want to stay somewhere that I don't even feel I can trust the employees.

To kick it all off, our TOILET would not work and everytime during the night we needed to flush it we had to fill it with our ice bucket. We tried to work with the staff on each of these things separatly and was told each time \"Not at this time,Ma'am/Sir\". They were not willing to fix any of their errors including the toilet! We paid $80 a night and according to a card in the room our stay was 100% guarenteed or our money back, but we have yet to see a refund. Honestly, this hotel was worst then ANY we have been in overseas. We certianly expect at least a working toilet for almost $100.", "Date": "November 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton Ohio", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "Verbatim", "ReviewID": "UR2438884", "Content": "The hotel was terrible!!

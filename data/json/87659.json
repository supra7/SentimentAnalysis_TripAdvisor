It's just north of the river between Clark and Dearborn. We request a high level floor and a riverview based on other reviews of this hotel. We received a riverview room on the seventh floor. The room was clean and well appointed with an excellent view of the river and south side skyline. I prepaid for our room which got us a rate of $109/night. That is db unheard of rate for a hotel in downtown Chicago. We also opted to not have housekeeping which earned us 500 extra points per night and a $5 voucher to be used at the hotel. We had room 724. On the second day, we returned to our room to find that the ceiling above the toilet was leaking. We called the front desk. They sent up someone to look at it. They also arranged for another room on a priority guest floor and gave us access to the lounge on the 20th floor. This more than made up for the inconvenience. Our second room was 1425. The room was great and a bit lighter than the one on the 7th floor. The bar in the lobby was good but pricey. It was $10 for a bottle of Guinness. The lounge on the 20th floor had complimentary water, soda, coffee, espresso and snacks. There was a wine machine that dispensed a taste, half glass or a full glass and charged it to your room using your room key. At 5pm they had snacks and you could order a drink. There were tvs, tables and chairs, music and couches in the room. In the morning they had a complimentary continental breakfast. A tip- park at Midway or O'Hare in one of the overnight lots and take the train into the city. The hotel charged about $50/night to park. We found a lot at midway with an online coupon for $9 per night. We were able to avoid all but one toll road coming in from Michigan and only had to pay $2.25 per person each way for the train.

Prior to arriving in Chicago, I set up a series of meetings. I called the Westin in advance to schedule the meetings in a restaraunt at the hotel. The folks answering the phone told me that their restaraunt is called Shula. So I asked the people I was meeting with to meet me at Shula. And at dinner time, I went looking for Shula myself to join the prospective clients for our dinner meeting. Turns out that the folks answering the phone work for Sheraton as it's also a Starwood property. They had told me about Shula not realizing I was staying at the Westin. As a result, my meetings started with some frustrated folks and one who went missing. When I told the Westin about this problem, they appologized, told me to have people meet me at Ember - their restaraunt - and they sent me a $5 bottle of wine. So i updated my meetings for the next day and asked people to meet me at Ember instead of Shula. The following evening, I found out that Ember only serves breakfast and lunch but not dinner. Again, I had to scramble to find a different restaraunt. When I asked the hotel why they did not point out that Ember is not open for dinner, I got no answer - just an apology. Westin topped off my visit with a dripping wet floor in my room. It seems that the room next door had a leaking shower and that the water ran under th wall and into my room. Consequently, the floor was wet and smelled of mildew. I had let the hotel know twice about the trouble they had caused by messing up my dinner meetings. So I was plenty annoyed when the best they could do was to tell me they were sorry and not much else. They treated the wet floor situation as routine and made no serious offer to fix anything. In fact, they didn't even offer to comp the room I had stayed in. Those are the facts. Based on the above, I'm going to avoid Westin in the future and the Chicago River North Westin - well, I hope situations never force me to stay there again. I see their management as incompetent, uncaring and not particularly and just plain stupid.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat sleeping in city location\u201d", "Author": "M2hra", "ReviewID": "UR126273210", "Content": "While this Westin looks like a typical upper level business hotel, it has a different feel.

The bus stop is just down the road. There are plenty of shops and restaurants (Starbucks, too) within walking distance from the hotel. There is a large open bar right in the lobby called the Hana Lounge. The service was a bit slow here and the prices are pretty expensive; but, it's convenient with comfortable seating and televisions screens above the bar. Their restaurant, also off the lobby, called the Ember Grille, is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We only had breakfast here on the last day, and it also was quite pricey, with just average service. I would suggest getting up early enough to walk to Starbucks for a more affordable option. The hotel's gym was quite impressive compared to other hotels. The room was spacious, with a very friendly greeter at the desk, plenty of modern cardio machines, weights and room for stretching.

The \"heavenly\" robes felt and looked as though they were ten years old. The deluxe suite was nice, though a river view would have been nicer when we inquired and thus denied. Only to find out later that the hotel was at 25% capacity (direct from an employee)....I'm sure one was available. Lastly, at checkout, the office valet attendant called down to the valet, after placing his personal phone call on hold, told me it would be 10 minutes (even though we were the only ones waiting).

Sometimes very busy, she was attentive but also was able to multi-task so well to keep waits at a minimum. She greatly enhanced our Chicago experience! I'd highly recommend booking at the Club Level. We did so this year after a complimentary upgrade there last year. The breakfast was delicious - fresh fruit, coffee and tea, bagels, yogurt, etc. Early evenings had appetizers and desserts. Often times we'd bring a little something back to our room to eat late at night. The lounge was staffed with attentive, professional welcoming workers. It was a pleasure to see them each morning or night. I thought the rooms were showing their age a bit, but overall our hotel experience was very positive. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.

I stayed here because I was attending a business meeting over several days. The lobby is large and dark (not especially welcoming.) There were 100s of us staying at the hotel, but the nightly rate was certainly not a bargain. The room I received looked out at another tall building so, as a result, even though the sun was shining, it always looked dark out the window. The room was 'OK\": nice size, closet with safe, both an upholstered chair and a lounge chair. desk & chair, dresser, nightstands, and a bar. Bathroom was lovely! Nice marble floor, well lit, excellent shower (2 heads, good water pressure), quality products. The TV needs to be either lifted (on top of the dresser) or hung on the wall since it is in front of the bed and not easy to watch from the bed. Water bottle in room is exorbitant (one could pick up a case of water around the corner from the hotel for less $); Internet in room is also pricey ($10+ daily.) At $200+ a night for the room, Internet should be provided! When I left the tip for the housekeeper daily, I asked her to leave a shower cap & another bar of soap. Got the soap but no cap. (Called guest services & one was delivered.) Since I forgot something, I ordered item online & had it delivered to the hotel. When I went to the front desk to pick up, I was shocked to see that the hotel charged me $10. REALLY?! By the way, I am a 'preferred guest'. I did receive one benefit as such: a late check out since my flight was scheduled for late afternoon. Overall, I didn't think that the staff was service-oriented, but there were a couple of staff I found to be exceptional. Kwasi A., one of the attendants in the Executive Club, was the perfect host: courteous, pleasant, knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating. Also, Sandra, the person I only spoke with on the phone several times, was efficient and friendly. It was always a pleasure to speak with her when I had to call to arrange for a wake-up call, etc. If I return to Chicago, I probably would select another hotel (since there are so many to choose from) unless I found a much better nightly rate here.

For instance, nice coffee in the room but no choice of ceramic cups or cardboard - just cardboard (home away from home? see more below) and if you would like extra you pay. For 1-800 numbers $2 plus tax, not the case in the previous hotel I stayed at in Indianapolis. Internet $9.95 for 24 hours - (try the Omni, join their partnership scheme, free and immediate effect for free internet and water.) I arrived back half 3 to find my room in the same way I had left it that morning. Turns out housekeeping goes on up until 5. I think this inadequate and say so - reception, manager apologise for the inconvenience with very sincere bobs of their heads but agree yes that is how it works. Basically your room may not be comfortable until gone 5 on any given day. Wanted to use a phone downstairs for a 1-800 - response from reception \"your room will be ready in a few minutes\" (I didn't ask; a waitress wanted to on my behalf, I was fed up with the ineffectual sincerity and not surprised with the response). Luggage assistance, one guy on (don't expect any of those valet services I'm used to in this class hotel) - he gave poor service, didn't get a tip, gave the heavily ironic \"thank you for allowing me to be of service to you\" as he turned his back. Mind, I did make my thoughts on that clear to him at the time. Add in the stale identifiable smell in the bathroom and the fact that in order to have the safe, which was in a locked position but open, so it could be used you had to be in the room. My advice to travellers is don't stay here unless you are a very undemanding business man who will be out all day and on expenses. My advice to Westin is forget the in room exercise programmes, maybe employ more minimum wage staff, maybe give them more than minimum wage if you have problem staffing, to mop bathroom floors and deal with luggage. And empty apologies, however sincerely and quick to be given are not what the customer wants - there needs to be some substance behind them. (I did get offered a free breakfast after the manager had spent about half an hour figuring it might be warranted) On the plus side the lounge staff were excellent and the sashimi was great.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, OH", "Title": "\u201cHotel that Works\u201d", "Author": "BrownStreet", "ReviewID": "UR111297700", "Content": "Enjoyed a get-away weekend at Westin Chicago River North.

First, check-in. Tee at front desk was so curtious and helpful and met all my requests and went beyond. Being Starwood gold member, I requested an upgrade to club floor level room. I knew this was a long shot as I have seen many other Westin hotel properties only give upgrade to Deluxe rooms. But Tee gave me the upgrade to a club floor room that included access to executive club lounge on 20th floor and in-room WIFI. Thanks again for your help Tee! The access to the club ounge helped us so much with our little boy on meal times. Second, room. The room was spacious and clean with a good size bathroom. I've stayed a lot at the Westin Chicago in Michigan avenue becuase of the location (Gold Coast area). However, the rooms here at Westin River North are a lot more better compared to Michigan Ave. The room had a good view of Chicago river which made it nice. One thing that I did not like was that there was no \"change to new sheets\" card that you see in other Starwood hotel properties. While I understand that reusing the sheets is a \"green policy\" that Starwood hotels are doing right now. I still think it should be the guest's choice to participate or not. I am not sure if this is a hotel policy or if my room just did not have the card. Overall it was a pleasant stay and I would most definately be returning to the hotel for my next visit to Chicago.

Good service, elegant and clean and overlooking the Chicago River in downtown. So now that I have praised this Westin, I'm allowed to quibble. The theme of the hotel is \"calm...refresh...sooth...relax in health\" etc. I think this theme is a little self-serving. For example, the good-looking woman on the TV tells you to take a deep breath...so I figure maybe they pipe in some Oxygen to the lobby and rooms...but no....she is just telling you that after extensive \"research\" they have decided that it is healthy if the hotel is non-smoking...like...duh...a non-smoking hotel these days...what a concept. Ok...so then to \"soothe\" you the lights are very dim in the lobby. Is that in keeping with the \"soothe and calm and relax\" theme or is it just to save electricity? Whatever, the shiny black tile floors are identical with the shiny tile black stairs leading down into the recessed lounge/bar area. So, bathed in this eerie, dim light, you need to be really careful descending into the lounge area, even long before you've had your first drink. Of course, there are plenty of staff greeters and concierges hanging in the lobby to be at your attention. Though perhaps they are there to just dust you off after you've plunged unceremoniasly into the bar area. The hotel is expensive and so is the braekfast buffet which costs $17 . There are a lot of fruity dishes at the buffet and healthy cereals (Again, I guess, in keeping with the \"healthy, soothing theme\"), but for that price the only eggs are scrambled and whether they are hot depends on how well the servers replenish those eggs. (one morning they did and one morning they didn't). Anyway, the sausages and bacon are great and the coffee is terrific. As I said, this area of the loop in Chicago is a great place to be with restaurants, bars and shops filled with really nice mid-western people.

I rarely travel without considering the Westin in my plans...so quite naturally when going to Chicago for St Patricks Day I thought what better hotel with a view of the river than the Westin River North...I was wrong. The morning of our arrival date I called to request a refrigerator and spoke with a kind hostess who assured me that we would have a \"complimentary\" refrigerator in our room upon arrival. But, that was about as kind as the weekend turned out. The problems began as soon as we entered the hotel. First, though we booked a room with a king bed. Upon arrival, we were told there were no more left for the night and we would have two queen beds, but we could be moved the following morning. This was not that big of a problem, but a little annoying. Then, our credit card kept declining, which wouldnt be a problem with the hotel except we could walk directly down the street and get money from the ATM machine to pay for the room. Then, the hotel said they would only be preauthorizing $200.00 for the stay, but turned out to be at least 4 separate preauth charges (2 for 200, 1 for 150, and 1 for around 75). Needless to say, when we finally got into our room, there was no refrigerator besides the wet bar of course...and i didnt feel like requesting since we were switching rooms the next day anyway. We booked a rate in which included access to the executive lounge and free breakfast. Initially, we did not have this access though the next morning and had to go back down 20 flights to get it. This would just be another accident except I basically \"argued\" with the host at the time behind the counter to look up the reservation deal because he did not believe we should have access. After finding out that we should, we received a simple \"oh thats new....ive never seen that before\". After breakfast, the Westin accommodated us into another room, which was better than the first room. But, then, we had a couple noisy neighbors that continued on throughout the night. When I think of vacation, I think of relaxation and ease. Ive already spent many hours working to make money, now I want to just sit back and enjoy it. If I'm going to spend more money in 2 days at the Westin of Chicago than a month's rent at home then the whole experience should be as smooth and possibly more convenient than a night at home.

The gym manager, Sam, was AWESOME (he opened early so I could fit my workout in before my morning conference) and gym was well-equipped with weights and aerobic equipment. Room were clean, well-kept lobby with a great sushi bar. Bathrooms were very nice and had all the amenities (and anything you forgot could be acquired at the front desk). The hotel had overbooked single king beds when I got there so they upgraded my room for free. Also, it was very close to a lot of good restaurants.

I must say reading the other reviews I had to double check that they were the same place I just stayed. There weren't many 'heavenly' things at this place. This is the first time I've even felt compelled to write a review on this website because things were so bad. First off, the bathroom was disgusting. They make everything black to hide the filth and it works fairly well but don't look at the tile grout while you're showering or you're likely to become ill. Second, the room was very dark. Even with the drapes open, they still cover about 1/4 of the window. Kinda ruined the view of the Sears Tower. Third, I was booked on the \"preferred guest\" floor which supposedly had free water. Yeah, the reason it's free is because after you drink the water bottle, they NEVER return to re-stock. I was there for three nights. Fourth, Isn't a hotel supposed to replace the shampoo and conditioner after you use them. The second day, I thought it was strange that they hadn't left me new bottles (since I had used half of the current ones). I didn't think anything of it until the last morning when I jumped in the shower before work, only to find that there were no shampoo or conditioner bottles at all. Fifth, the shower was almost impossible to use. The water dribbled out of the showerhead. I'm sure that I could have gotten a better shower at a Super 8. In the interest of fairness, the bed was comfortable and they provided a power strip next to the bed so you don't have to break your neck trying find a plug for your charger. The power strip didn't look great but served its purpose. I was there for a work conference and not to add insult to injury with this place, the food was horrible.

The location is fantastic. The staff is very very helpful. I needed a cot for one night and, when I asked for it to be removed, it was removed immediately the next day. The restaurant is okay - it might be nice to have another restaurant like the Palm or one of those chains at the hotel. Just a thought.... My very favorite thing about the hotel is the gentleman who manages the Westin Workout facility, Sam Guiragossi. He is, simply put, \"the best!\" I stayed there last year and he sent me home with a work out routine. Although I have been excercising for insulin-dep. diabetes for nearly 30 years each day, I knew that I needed more weight and strength training. I was under pressure to finish a thesis last year and used his recommendations from last year's routine throughout the year some. This year, however, with my thesis behind me, I was happy to meet with him again. And, once again, he listened to what I needed to change in order to become more toned and fit. He measured my body fat and bmi (which incidentally was fine on today's chart, but I'd rather they be fine on yesterday's chart) and helped me to begin a program that would affect areas that need to be tightened as well as work with the pain that I have because I have not been stretching nor drinking enough water for ,really, years. Now that I am home, I have been doing his work out routines far more regularly than last year and hope to see improvements. By far, the gym is SO MUCH BETTER because of Sam and his energy and spirit in helping others who want to help themselves. He is cordial to everyone who walks through the door and takes his work seriously. I can't wait to come back and have an appointment with Sam!!! I wish the hotel and the rooms were not so dark. I think the rooms could be more pleasingly appointed. I think brighter walls might help, but the bedding is luxurious and very comfortable.

Everything that we wanted to see was within walking distance and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any transport apart from taxis to and from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare Airport. Our room was a decent size and the bed was really comfortable, with high class linen. The bathroom, like the bedroom, was modern and spotlessly clean. There was complementary tea and coffee and a flat screen TV. Check-in was quick and easy, and the staff members were helpful by giving us advice about where to eat and drink in the vicinity. Equally so, the concierge was friendly and informative, particularly about the 4th of July celebrations that coincided with our stay. There are three or four private internet terminals in the lobby but this is a paid service apart from checking in for flights and printing boarding passes, which is complimentary. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the hotel as we were out so much, so unfortunately I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the bars or restaurants apart from to say that they looked extremely good. Nearby there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great spot for breakfast at the junction of Dearborn Street and Kinzie Street called Einstein Brothers Bagels, and directly opposite this is Harry Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steakhouse where we ate perfect steaks and loved the huge wine list. Both are only two minutes walk from the front door of the hotel. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a fun night out I thoroughly recommend Rockit on Hubbard Street between Dearborn Street and State Street.

Since I am loyal to Starwood brand, I chose the Westin River North. The Mart is only 2 blocks away so the location is fantastic! As a Starwood Platinum member, I emailed the general manager, Peter Simoncelli, in advance, to inquire about an upgraded room and of course, they always say \"upon check-in\" you will receive the best room available and he also, offered a room on the Executive Club Level for additional $40, which I decline. I shared a cab from Midway Airport for flat $16. + tip and checked in. I was given a Executive Deluxe room on 16th floor with river view and it was small. I know the hotel was probably booked for Neocon, but it's very rare, as a lifetime Platinum member, that I don't get a suite and I checked on the web prior to my departure and suites were available. Oh well, the room was tiny, but a bit larger than the standard room and the view was amazing! Heavenly bed, desk, chaise lounge, flat 32\" panel TV, Starbucks coffee, Tazo tea and maker, mini bar, marble bathroom with combo shower/tub. Closet with in room safe and I had to request a robe and a mini refrigerator...I have to say the service is very speedy and efficient. I did not hear any noise when I was in my room and able to sleep very well. Platinum members have access to the Westin Executive Club on the 20th floor which is open from 6 am to 10 pm and serves a nice continental breakfast 6-10 am weekdays and 7-11 am weekends. You'll find oatmeal, cereal, fruit, toast, coffee, tea, orange juice, small pastries, boiled eggs. Access is for 2 people and additional guests are $15. plus tax and gratuity. The Executive Club Happy Hour hors d'oeuvres are 5 - 7 pm and offered a good selection of nibbles. Beverage service is sodas, water, pretzels, trail mix, etc. The staff in the Executive Club were very friendly and welcoming. There is an Apple iMac computer in the lounge, which was really great and I hear that they are in all the Club Floor rooms. There are three computers on the lobby level for a fee. Westin WORKOUT on mezzanine is complimentary to Executive Club floor guests and in-room wireless internet. There is no pool, but you can use the one at the Sheraton, just show your room key. I did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants, Ember Grill, Hana Lounge or Kamehachi Sushi. Chicago is a foodie's heaven, but the Atwood Cafe that the concierge helped us get a reservation at, was terrible! Cabs are very easy to get and a short ride will run $8. with tip. The Westin is very close to the Mart and is in an excellent location for my needs, but I like the Sheraton better, as the rooms are bigger. You have to check out the new Barneys NY and Hermes store on Oak St. Things have changed since I was there last...

I was in town for the NeoCon tradefair at the Merchandise Mart, which about 3-4 blocks away from the hotel. Check-in was easy, no problems there. Although the lady who checked us in never gave us any sort of info about the hotel (the gym, restaurant, bar, etc...) so it was up to us to venture and find out. There was no breakfast included, and I think it was about $22 in the restaurant on site. I never ate there. There are plenty of dining options in the area within walking distance. The room was a king size bed non-smoking and was very clean and comfortable. The entire hotel is non-smoking. The showers were amazing, with double head faucets! There was a large desk, flat screen tv, and small fridge which was pre-filled with goodies (for a fee). There was also a lounge chair with ottoman and a chaise lounge chair near the window. There was a large closet, with a safe and ironing board w/ iron as well. The hotel is very energy conscience and every time housekeeping came to clean up, they would turn off all the lights that we had left on, and also unplug any chargers we had left plugged into the wall, being unused. They left my laptop plugged in for me though! I left it out on the desk the entire stay and never had a problem with anything being touched, moved, or stolen. The doorman, concierge, and staff were all very friendly. The girl at check-out helped me enroll in their rewards program, and gave me a coupon for tickets to a concert! There were plenty of cabs waiting on the side street if you needed, and the doorman would whistle for one. The O'Hare Airport took about 30-45 mins to get to, depending on traffic, by cab and/or GO Shuttle. There are all the subway lines close by, and we walked everywhere! The only negative things were: no free breakfast, not even continental. For the price you would at least expect coffee, juice, and muffins/bagels. You could also hear all the slamming doors from other hotel guests, not really the hotels fault though, but it did wake me quite a few times. I also couldn't get the internet connection to work with my laptop in the room. There is no wireless in the rooms, but there is a cable connection. I never contacted the Front Desk with help with this, so not sure if it was fixable or not. I've never had problems in other hotels though. The only outlet(s) for charging electronics was at the desk -- I would have liked one under the nightstand so I didn't need to have my cell phone/alarm plugged clear across the room, and so I could sit in bed with my laptop. I would stay here again if I were going to Chicago, and would recommend it to everyone else. I can't really comment on any hotel amenities, as I didn't use them.

But I have stayed in Westin hotels that were nicer (particularly in St. Louis & Key West). Even the Chicago Westin Michigan Ave. seemed a bit nicer when I was there a few years ago. Although I was only visiting my parents who were staying at that hotel and not actually staying there myself. The Chicago Westin Michigan Ave. was all booked so I chose this one instead. Figuring since it got a better rating on Tripavisor it must be as good or better. Maybe I've just been spoiled by some really great experiences at other Westin hotels but the room seemed relatively unspectacular and not what I usually see at a Westin hotel. We didn't have a nice river view as some reviewers have described but we didn't care too much about that as we weren't in town to hang out in our hotel room. I guess my main complaints were that there seemed to be a good deal of street noise (we were on the eighth floor) and the roomed seemed a bit warm even on cool nights. I like it very cool when I sleep (so does my fiance) so we turned down the thermostat as far as it would go (65F, no choice between heat or AC). We also turned the fan on high, partly to try to drown out some of that street noise, and keep the room as cool as possible. The nightly lows were around 50For below outside so you wouldn't think the room should be warm at all. I woke up a few times during the night sweaty and uncomfortable. The location was perfect for us as we were enjoying the great number of restaurants in the area L stops are a short walk away as well ( we took the red-line to a Cubs game on Sat.). The service was fine in getting us cabs, the car, etc. in a timely manner.

The only negative experience we had was a noisy wedding party in the room next door to us. Accordingly, I would recommend not staying in a room with a connecting door since it made the noise all the louder. We had this occur two nights in a row and after we raised the issue with the front desk, they handled the situation very professionally by immediately offering us complimentary wine and cheese plate and adding points to our Starwood account for the inconvenience. The only other complaint was that the complimentary water that is offered as part of the Deluxe Room was not delivered two days in a row, even after we rang for it.

It's the first time (of many times I regret to say) that we have been treated with such respect when being told our room wasn't ready yet. We waited about 30 minutes and our room was ready and the front desk asked if they could give us some champagne and strawberries to make up for not having the room ready and also for our anniversary. Whaaaat? Hotels still do this???? Got to our room and it was spotless!!! We had a deluxe king rm that overlooked the river and the view was wonderful..the Chicago river and the city lights were gorgeous! The bathroom is good sized and so clean. Spend the extra for this room. You won't be sorry. The \"heavenly\" bed lived up to its name. Not only was it comfortable but all of the bed linens and quilt are white and spotless. When we returned from dinner we found a bottle of champagne and a beautiful bowl of strawberries with a hand written note of anniversary congratulations from the Westin. I am very discerning and a clean freak and I have to say that this hotel did not disappoint us on any level. It is by far the best hotel we've ever stayed at while in Chicago and it is the only one we will stay at in the future. These folks are doing things right. They truly make their guests feel welcome and appreciated and I have to admit it was a bit shocking (in a good way) to be treated like that. Another thing I'll mention is that the location rocks!!!

Good size comfortable room, with faultless housekeeping. 4. Quiet at night. We disliked: 1. Absence of help with baggage on arrival (other reviews mention this). 2. Miserable flow of water from the shower in our bathroom (even when the second of two showerheads was engaged). 3. Main restaurant had a disappointing and expensive breakfast offering, and was closed in the evening. 4. Main public areas were dark and unattractive, with little seating outside the lounge bar area (the decor generally was reminiscent of the hotel's previous Japanese identity, and needs brightening up). 5. The bedroom had no masterswitch, and turning out all the lights was not as easy as it should have been. 6. No visible security as regards access to the room floors (no card access requirement for the elevators, no chains on the room doors) - though I should add that we felt very safe walking in Chicago, day and night, throughout our stay. 7. They charge $10 a day for WiFi access, and free access to the desktops in the lobby is limited to airline check-ins. Your fellow guests are likely to be chattering conference attendees.

The outside of the hotel and the lobby were nice. When you walk in there is a lounge and that looks way cool. We ate at the lounge and the food was good, but the service was terrible.

We were presently surprised after we discovered the Westin River North would be our home for the weekend. The location is right on the Chicago River, overlooking Wacker Drive and downtown Chicago. It is very easy walking distance to the Loop, the El trains and Michigan Avenue. The River North neighborhood is home to many great restaurants and seems to have better nightlife than the Loop. All in all, it really was a very convenient location for exploring the city. It seems to cater primarily to business travelers, but is also a very comfortable and accomodating property for leisure travelers as well. The room was large and comfortable, with a very nice chaise lounge (fainting couch?) right by the floor-to-ceiling window. A great place to sit and watch boats sail along on the river down below. The bathroom was also very large, lots of counter space, large mirrors, etc. The style was somewhat Asian, with dark marble tiles and sleek lines. (I think this property was previously a Hotel Nikko, or something like that. The architecture and some of the furnishings are definitely a hold-over from that, although still very nice.) The only drawback I have about this property is their unwillingness to place us in a different room. Three of us (adults) had purchased the room using Priceline. (Yes, I know the fine print at Priceline tells us that the reservation is technically only for two people.) When we checked in, we requested a room with two beds but were told they had us in a room with one king bed. We asked for a different room but was told they were \"sold out\" for 2nd night of our stay and they wouldn't be able to move us. Even though two of us are Starwood members, we were still refused on our request to get a room with 2 beds. I find it hard to believe the hotel was sold out -- especially since they kept saying it was sold out the next night. I feel like we were somewhat given the shaft because we were Priceline customers. I, of course, have no way of verifying this. We tried calling down to the front desk later in the evening, and even stopped by there in person the next morning and were still met with resistance. Even though the room was very comfortable, the front desk staff and their service left me with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth.

Apparently, what they do not tell you when you pay extra for the club level is that they only expect two people in your party to enjoy it. If you have two young children staying in your room, the club employees make it very clear that they should be charging you $12/person for each snack time that you bring more than 2 people there.

Bottom line is that I would NOT stay here again. First, however, I will mention the few positive aspects of this hotel. It is in a great location for food and nightlife (short walk to tons of amazing restaurants and cool bars). We tried Vong's Thai Kitchen, Frontera Grill for Mexican, Sushi Samba, and Lou Malnati's (pizza/pasta)...all of which were AWESOME. Also loved the Rockit Bar for drinks! All those places were just a short walk away from the Westin, so we were happy about that. Now for the negative. Before we even got to Chicago, I had issues with the reservations department. I booked through the ABA's travel people and was supposed to have a \"Deluxe\" river view room, but when I called to confirm, the reservations lady was beyond rude and told me I was only booked for a standard room and there was nothing she could do for me. I then emailed the Westin customer service people and was IMMEDIATELY notified that my room had been upgraded and that everything was taken care of...So I felt better. Then, when we get there (just about 45 minutes before check-in), our room was ready - which was fine - but when I asked the guy at the front desk how long it would be, he said he had no idea and couldn't even guarantee it would be ready by normal check-in time...I was already frustrated because of my long trip and my problems with reservations beforehand, so this wasn't the perfect way to start off our stay. The room: outdated, very disappointing for a \"corner riverview room\" - especially considering the rate we paid. We even walked over to the Renaissance across the street (we LOVE Renaissance hotels btw) to see if we could switch rooms, but they were booked solid -- so we decided to try and stick it out. I will admit the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice...definitely nothing fancy though. Concierge service: had to wait several times for the concierge to even be at their desk...have mixed emotions about this, as one lady was really great and the other didn't seem to care much about helping us out. Did get a good list of restaurants though. :) Overall - I wouldn't recommend this for the price.

The wine bar next to the InterContinental has great wines and great service. We ate at Two of the restaurants they recommended.

We got a great deal off of Priceline for $80/night per room which was awesome compared to everything else in the area. Despite the good deal, there were a few issues we had with the hotel. For starters, when we checked in they asked for an ID and a credit card. They did not say anything about charging the card but before we knew it, she was handing the card back to us saying it went thru for the first room but was denied on the second.. We had prepaid online and she did not say anything about charging the card so my sister then got a little rude and asked why the card was even charged. They said it was a $200 charge PER ROOM for incidentals. Now we don't stay in hotels that often and this may be a common practice but she should have at least told us she was charging the card! Upon arriving to our room we realized that we were given king beds when we requested double beds. They did say they would try to accomidate requests but I find it hard to believe every double bed room was taken 3 weeks prior to our arrival when we made that request. When we got back to the hotel later that night (Very late - abt 2:30 in the morn) we asked the front desk for an extra blanket for the one person who was going to have to sleep on the chaise. An hour and a half later the blanket arrived... There was no way the front desk was that busy that late at night for it to take an hour and a half. Our last complaint was getting woken up to room service \"knocking\" with their key twice then before we could even answer the door, COMING IN our room while we were getting ready and my sister was in the shower!!

The rooms were top-notch and everything about our visit went smoothly. Read on for details: LOCATION: The Westin Chicago River North is located just outside the northern end of the Loop, on the river, between Dearborn and Clark streets. It is about a 5 minute walk from the Magnificent Mile, about 10 minutes from Millennium Park, and maybe 15-20 to the Art Institute and museum district. Driving, the hotel is completely subject to the vagaries of Chicago traffic, but it's in the neighborhood of 45 minutes to O'Hare airport with typical traffic, and about 10 minutes from McCormick Place. Cab fare from O'Hare was $42 excluding tip. PROPERTY: The Westin has a nice lobby bar, which also has a Sushi Bar attached. There is a full-service restaurant off the lobby. There are available computer terminals that form a sort of mini-business-center just next to registration. The main entrance of the hotel is actually on the 2nd physical floor, and the two levels leading down to River level are meeting rooms and ballrooms, all of which are in excellent condition. There is a fitness center on the Mezanine level. Guest rooms are between floors 3 and 20, with the top two floors being the Westin Executive Club -- generally reserved for suites, top room rates, and high-level Starwood Preferred Guest members. There is a Club Suite on the 20th floor serving complimentary breakfast in the morning, and complimentary hors d'oeuvres in the afternoon, available to guests staying on the Club floors. The Club also offers an executive Business Center which is slightly more functional than the computer cubicles in the lobby. ROOMS: The rooms in the Westin are exceptional. All rooms were fully equipped with the Westin package, including their Heavenly Beds (they are!) and their dual-head showers. As a Starwood Gold guest, I received a complimentary upgrade to a Club-level room upon check-in. The westward-facing rooms have a great view down to the river, and all rooms have large nearly floor-to-ceiling windows, with both a privacy shade and a black-out curtain. Not certain if all rooms have all of the other amenities, but our club-level room also had a clock/radio with included iPod dock, a POD-type coffee brewer, complimentary wireless Internet, a flat-panel TV and in-room electronic safe. STAFF: The staff at the hotel were wonderful. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, the bellmen and guest services crew went out of their way to assist with plans both inside and outside of the hotel, and the lobby bar crew are experts at serving business groups -- attentive but not overbearing. OTHER: Anyone driving here should beware that on-site parking at the hotel is criminally expensive -- a whopping $42 per night for valet parking with in/out privileges! While it's definitely convenient to park on-site, there is a lot about two blocks away at (I believe) Kinzie and LaSalle Streets, with an overnight rate of $22. The hotel staff actually told us about this alternative lot, so I suspect many guests elect to self-park there. In general, our stay at the Westin was exceptionally smooth and productive. Our meetings in their river-level rooms went smoothly, the rooms themselves were comfortable and well-appointed, and the staff did their jobs well. I would recommend this hotel to any business group, but also to any tourist if you can get a decent rate.

I used to love the service, and I am one of those model customers - stay 30+ times per year, never complain, etc., but things are progressively deteriorating. My recent problems at the Westin River North are small, but continue the downward trend. 1. After staying at Starwood properties for close to 30 nights, I tried to use my points to book a personal stay - only to discover I had none. According to \"customer service\" all of my points were going to an airline, and they claimed I had authorized this. I asked for proof - a signed paper, an email form, anything - but they refused to provide any, and refused to give me my points back. 2. I originally was upgraded to a concierge level at every stay - once I corrected their mistake on the airline and began collecting actual Starwood points for real, those upgrades stopped. At the West River North, I was dropped down to the preferred level, and then to the regular level. For some reason, I stopped receiving the benefits that I had supposedly earned as a regular customer - free water, free internet, free health club access - all gone. 3. When I went to Westin's front desk to let them know about minor housekeeping issues - i.e., I didn't get a bottle of water, the soap was thrown away each night, and someone's used hair tie went from the floor into my back of hair supplies (ick). I was pretty nice about it - just \"here's an FYI for your housekeeping staff.\" The attendant's response was to roll her eyes, tell me the water was the mini-bar's responsibility, and ask why I was complaining about the soap being thrown away. I had to ask whether they had ever heard of the environment in Chicago For those of you who wonder, take 100 rooms * 2 bars of soap per night * 365 days per year * the number of hotels in Chicago, and ask yourself if you want that in your water supply. I've stayed in hotels (including the Westin) enough to know they usually don't throw away the soap if the same person stays in the room.

There is alot of construction going on around the hotel and downtown in general. We had an issue with our shower but we didn't bother complaining about it. It was leaking and squirting out the sides. The shower head was also coming away from the wall. The caulking around the bathtub had some mold on it. It was difficult to see at first because the caulk was infact a black color (matched the black marble tiles). The only thing I did not like about this place was that it was extremely dark. The lobby area had very dim lighting and so did the rooms. But that is the style of the hotel. Our beds were very comfortable. I used the gym twice (there's a $10 fee). There was a good selection of equipment and it was clean. We had some drinks at the bar and some sushi one night. I wouldn't recommend eating/drinking at the hotel as they charge around 15% tax on any food/drink at the hotel, which would be the same in any hotel in Chicago. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel either. There's an Einstein Bagel outside the hotel where we ate breakfast. There are lots of restaurants within a few minutes walk of the hotel.

There are parking garages all over the place in that area. We kept our car at a garage a half block away - it was $35 for 2 nights. Other comments on the hotel: - The location was stellar. There are so many restaurants/attractions you can walk to that I can't begin to list them. Anytime we wanted to get a cab, the bell staff just waved and it was there waiting for us. - The lobby is beautiful and very inviting for drinks.

I am a Starwood Platinum member who travels a lot. Typically I stay at W's, Westins and Sheratons. Geographically, this hotel is well-located and some of the rooms have nice views of the river. However , I digress . . . Usually, when in Chicago, I stay at the W Lakeshore, but I tried out the Westin Chicago River North because of the high ratings on this site as well as its proximity to the Chicago office of the company I joined a couple of months ago. Upon arrival, the person who was checking me in at reception answered the phone and, after a moment, actually rolled his eyes (not to me in a wink-wink conspiratorial way, just in general pissed off) while he was speaking to the guest who was calling. (I figured my front desk friend was just having a bad day.) Later, I found out that my flustered friend only programmed one of my two cardkeys, so I had to go back to reception after going to dinner. Since I was there, I thought I would do the hotel a favor and mention the incident that occurred earlier, as I'd think most hotels would want their staff members to be polite when working the front desk. Thus, I waited for the on-duty front desk manager, William, to end a phone call he was on. The call seemed to go on for a bit, and it became apparent that the guest on the other end was clearly not happy with his/her accommodations for some reason. I was pretty surprised when I heard William raise his voice to almost shouting level and say to the guest, \"No, I will *not* reduce your rate!!!\" His outrage was quite obvious to all of us waiting for service, as he flailed his free hand and scrunched up his face. Upon hanging up, he turned to his staff and said quite dramatically, \"Send housekeeping to Room [insert room number here].\" One of them asked \"Is he checking out early?\" William retorted \"Yes!!!\" Then, he turned to we waiting guests and said very pointedly and loudly \"And if any of *you* are thinking about checking out early, let me just tell you there is not one room left in the city tonight!!!\" I realized then where the guy who checked me in got his training. I told William that I found his behavior to be quite unprofessional, especially as a manager, and he said \"How dare you--you don't even *know* me!\" I replied \"Of course I don't know you; it's merely my impression as a guest in this hotel who observed you shouting at someone on the phone from behind the front desk where everyone could see and hear you. And then to be brought into it!\" He just rolled his eyes at me and crossed his arms and said something like \"Whatever!\" I finally got back to my room and called Starwood Preferred Guest hoping I could switch hotels, but William was right about things being booked up. Suffice it to say, I will never stay at that hotel again, and I'll warn anyone who broaches the idea away from it.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cA nearly perfect stay - but read on for details...\u201d", "Author": "Road_warrior_123", "ReviewID": "UR8097292", "Content": "I was impressed with the location of this hotel for a visit to Chicago.

Staff is generally competent and friendly. The decor is a bit skewed towards the W side of Starwood's portfolio - it's a 1970's vintage era hotel that has been refurbed in a kind of retro/chic way to appeal to the 25-35 target market. Rooms are fairly standard, and as others have noted, the overall light levels are low in the rooms. The Heavenly Bed is present and comfortable, but lamps are a bit dusty, and the minibar console in my room was missing an inset panel. Bathrooms include tub/shower combos with curved shower rods that are sagging due to improper installation. There is an odd double showerhead that is oversized for the tub/shower enclosure and I can't imagine most people successfully using both showerheads at the same time. Toilet seats and lids are plastic and yellowing with age against the white porcelain bowl. The frameless mirror hides fluorescent lights that don't light one's face very well. A massive armoire encloses a 20\" TV in a space that could easily accommodate a 32\" regular TV or a 36\" widescreen flat panel. The desk is large but the desk chair is tiny and straight-backed, digging into one's backbone like a small torture device. The closet is enclosed but not lighted insde. My room had several minor errors in amenity placement and maintenance. Upon entry the remote for the TV was inoperative, probably due to dead batteries; a call to guest services brought a replacement in about six minutes. The next morning I endured a slow draining tub that had water up past my ankles by the time my shower was done; a call to guest services brought an engineer in about 15 minutes. That evening, I wanted to have a shirt laundered and couldn't find a valet ticket with the plastic valet bag; a call to guest services promised a response, but 30 minutes later, I had to call again, and after the second call, a staff member arrived with a plastic bag...but no valet ticket. Another five-minute delay and I finally got that little problem resolved. With a reasonable CapEx effort, the rooms at this hotel could be stunning. As it is, it's a very typical Westin property that has no compelling advantages over like-kind Marriotts, Hiltons or Hyatts. Its most redeeming feature is its location.

(Back story- We normally stay across the street at House of Blues which we LOVE, but this trip we ended up at the Westin River North. I work about a block from here and we do live in Chicago on the North side. It was my husband's birthday weekend and I wanted to do something nice so I planned a birthday weekend. We both recently just turned 30 to give you our age range) The first night the hotel seemed to be hosting some type of prom or similiar function. Their were teens running all over the hotel from about 8 o'clock on. I checked in at about 1 pm with no incident. The front desk staff was friendly and attentive upon check-in. After we arrived back from dinner the first evening we went to our room and then came back down to the lounge for drinks. Big mistake! After three separate attempts to get our drink order we watched and listened to security chase prom-goers through the lobby and hotel. The only time security didn't care was if they came into the lounge and ordered a drink. We finally left when, what seemed to be maybe the chaperone's for the evening came into the evening clearly happy to left off some stress but WAY too loud yelling their drink orders. This didn't go on for just a few minutes which could have been understandable, but at least 10 minutes at which time we left. We went back to our room, hoping to put the events of the lounge/lobby/hotel behing us and enjoy a shower and some sleep. We turned on the shower only to find that there was no hot water. After about 30 minutes of fighting with all the shower water settings and making sure this wasn't our error I hopped in frustrated, tired and fed up while my husband called the front desk. The front desk calls engineering, who checks the temperature and about an hour later my husband finally has a hot shower. Or so he tells me, by this point I'm shivering in bed half asleep and thoroughly disgusted with the Westin. So much for \"Heavenly Shower\" Day 2. I can only hope it gets better, we discuss checking out and totally scrapping plan for weekend but decide to try and give it another shot. How long can prom last? It is just a one night event right? I stop at the front desk and speak to a brunette. After helping everyone in site including the random people that just walk up even though I am clearly waiting in line, she finally has no choice but to help me. I explain to her the events of the past evening. She proceeds to smile and at points giggle while I tell her my story. I ask her the source of her amusement and she gets confused, and says she doesn't understand what I want. I ask her if the problems are going to continue for another day and she begins to say \"Security tried....\" and then lets her sentence trail off never finishing....After a minute or so she asks if I want to \"complain to a manager\". I tell her she has a lot to learn about dealing with customers and walk off. We head off for the days events- massages, shopping, lunch, etc. We arrange to meet back in time to get ready for our Tut at Twilight Tickets at the Field Museum which I arrange for weeks ago. At 5 o'clock we are surprised to find the room still not cleaned by house keeping. My husband jumps in the shower while I keep watch for the maid. After about 15 mins. I venture into the hall in search of her, only to find she speaks no English. I finally write my room number for her and she says she will be there in 5 mins. At about 5:30 my husband and I head to the lounge again to try again and hope that when we return the room will FINALLY be clean. Before we leave I take all our used towels and place them in a pile on the floor of the room, I put a note on the bed and ask for 2 of the extra large 30x60 Westin bath towels since there are two of us and we would like to both have a bath towel when we get out of the shower. I leave a tip with my note. We come back half hour later to find our room finaly clean, YAY. We don't have 2 bath towel, but what seems to be an endless supply of the smaller hair towels (probably 20x12) and 2 robes. This seems like a nice thought, but not quite on the mark. I call housekeeping request what I ASKED FOR ALREADY and then head to the shower. My husband waits for the towels. About 5 minutes into my shower I hear the phone ring. My husband comes to tell me they called back after telling me \"no problem they would be right up with my towels\" that they have none. They explain to him that they have 1 per room and it's too late in the day to get any. He tries to explain we don't have any, we had 1 it was dirty and the maid took it and only left a little while ago, but this doesn't help. No towel for us. I'm still trying to figure out how/when this shower becomes a \"heavenly shower\"...I think the whole thing is laughable.No hot water, no towels. There is NOTHING heavenly about this shower, or trip for that matter. After I dry off with the postage stamp towels I am apparently luck to get and so does my husband we finish getting ready. We head to the valet to catch a cab to head to the Field Museum. We arrive at Valet to find an absolute free-for-all. There is no valet or anyone from the Westin in site. There are 8+ people trying to either get out of cabs and unload luggage or get a cab. Cabs aren't willing to take the people since they need to take cabs from the \"cab stand\", but since there is nobody from valet nobody knows how to get a cab from the cab stand. This chaos goes on for about 5 minutes. We walk across the street to House of Blues and their valet gets us a cab. Upon returning from the museum, dinner and the foundation room we head to the room unwilling to take our chances in the lounge again. We get to the room and settle in. After relaxing for some time we order a pizza from a local pizza restaurant. About an hour later the front desk calls to tell me they won't let the deliver driver come to my room and I have to come to the front desk to get my food. I hang up annoyed. This information is not disclosed anywhere that I have seen. I arrive in the lobby to find NOBODY at the front desk but the delivery driver from the pizza place. I didn't know I needed my credit card, and the front desk certainly didn't mention it. The delivery driver and I walk up to my room so I can give him the imprint of my credit card. Nobody says anything since there is NOBODY in the lobby anywhere, nor the front desk. The front desk had inconvenienced me for NO REASON, but this seems par for the course at the Westin. Perhaps this is their business model. I get my bill slipped under my door, I review the bill. It has an extra $30 in phone calls which I never made. I purposely made all my calls, except 1 from my cell due to the cost of calls. As did my husband. After my interaction with the front desk this isn't worth dealing with, I fill out the survey and sign the check-out form. (Not surprisingly the total charged to my credit card was even higher than the slip I signed at check out when I saw it on my bank statement a few days later) I want to be done with the Westin. We will never stay there again, we will never recommend it to anyone. I would never consider them in any city. They clearly don't seem to care regardless of any member of staff. I sent an email to the Westin, I filled out the satisfaction questions on my check-out form, I filled out a automated form on the Westin website, I have never heard a word from them.", "Date": "June 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPrime Location!\u201d", "Author": "CHerPig", "ReviewID": "UR5314194", "Content": "The Westin River North is absolutely 4 star!

Navy Pier was the destination located farthest from our hotel, but there is a FREE shuttle provided from a nearby corner. We used the shuttle to Navy Pier and returned via taxi at a cost of $4 plus tip. CHEAP!

Since you are already paying top dollar to stay here, I think that they are highly out of line to submit guests to this additional charge.

I just hope that when they re-open they will have gotten rid of all the BED BUGS that bit the heck out of my legs!! They most certainly need renovations, everything is REALLY run down, dirty  basically needs replacing. I understand that they were closing for renovations but that does not mean the staff needs to be rude. They basically had an I DONT GIVE A [--] attitude. I did not expect Ritz Carlton Service or anything of the sort, but I've honestly gotten better service at the 99 cent store. I was so upset my husband finally convinced me to let it go and think of it as an adventure. I literally wanted to go to another hotel, unfortunately there were 3 HUGE conventions that week and we could not find any availability. We tried to go the hotel just to sleep so we could avoid any dissapointments. But then we got Bitten!! Literally, by Bed Bugs! The entire 4 days we stayed there the Bed lineds were not changed, I know this because the first day I spilled some make-up powder on the bed and it left a little stain. The stain was there the whole time, even after I called the front desk and asked to have the linens changed. They basically shewed me off with a yeah yeah and never did anything! I will never stay at any Clarion gain! I chose it because they have a decent reputation but never again!! Beware even after renovations, they will change their name so be careful!

Great Location! Right on St. Charles Avenue! Lobby is very attractive! Now, for the negative! When I visited there was only one elevator working and this was used by staff and guests. There were MANY times that the elevator was too crowded (the max was 6 people) and I had to either wait or take 5 flights of stairs to my 5th floor room. The room I stayed in had no clock of any kind, paper cups instead of glass coffee cups, and if you wanted to have internet access or use of the gym facility you had to pay a fee of around $5.95. If you didn't care about the gym or internet you still had to pay a fee of $5.95! The sink in our room, #516, did not drain. The tub drained but it was VERY SLOWLY! We called the front desk to have them aware of this around 8:30 am. When we returned to our room at 4 pm the sink was still clogged. 15 minutes after returning to the room there was a knock on the door from staff wanting to unclog the sink, well since we were headed to the French Quarter I was occupying the bathroom getting ready. Staff said they would return in 15 minutes. We got back to hotel at 11 pm that night...sink STILL clogged. We called downstairs, staff came up and sucked the water out of the sink and said it was fixed. Next morning when we brushed our teeth, etc, sink became full of water again and still did not drain! I woke up Sunday morning at 7 am with guests screaming and vomiting in hallways, and Saturday when I went downstairs to buy a soda I encountered a prostitute and guest in the elevator. If you are going to N.O. to party and have no children then this is a great hotel. If you are bidding on priceline and can get this hotel cheap, then this is an okay hotel. If you are paying full price for this hotel then you are making a huge mistake!

Okay, mistakes happen -- but wouldn't an apology for the inconvenience be in order? Not from these folks.

Let me walk you through our adventure. As we were waiting to check in, the phone at the front desk was ringing off the hook, all seemingly for complaints about the air/heat in the rooms. We were told that we had a smoking room, though we did not want one (we didn\u9225\u6a9b complain \u9225?we were still trying to have a positive attitude). Heading up on the elevator that was old, graffiti ridden, and frankly, scary, we looked at each other, wondering what could possibly await us in Room 501. Walking into the room, we quickly noticed the ripped walpaper, the bad smell, the broken heat AND TV, and, the worst of all, the U shaped bed (the mattress was so old it seemd to fold up like a raft.) Me and my sweetie slept huddled together in the valley of the U shaped mattress. I\u9225\u6a93 not kidding. Other highlights? The stained, lopsided lampshades, the broken fridge, the torn curtains, and the NON WORKING TV all added up to a very disappointing night in the Big Easy.

That was fine, but I asked how that happens.She said just because I booked through an agency doesn't mean it guarantees my room cause they didn't block out the reservation, and they book on a first come first serve basis. How August is not first, I have no idea. The girl was very rude to me. She then told me that they were only putting me somewhere else for the night, and if I wanted a hotel the next night I would have to pay and get reimbursed through the booking agency. I told her that was ridiculous because I could not pay up front for anything else. She said if I wanted I could come in the morning and see if they had rooms available. I asked why I couldn't have her reserve my room, especially since it was already reserved, right then. She got mad at me, told me she wasn't even supposed to be there, ripped up my ticket to go to the Marriot, threw it away, and walked off.Of course I got mad, and told her this was horrible customer service and I had every right to be mad at THEIR mistake. Eventually another girl helped me, but I never got a room for the next night, and no one would reimburse me for the nights I paid for up front.This situation happened to about 10 other guests while I was there.Also, an older woman came down as I was there and stated she had been waiting since 4pm for someone to fix her electricity in her bathroom.

There is also a continental breakfast i.e. lots of coffee and Danish pastry included in the price. The parking and the breakfast probably shave $20/night off equivalent stays elsewhere.Apparently there is a wireless internet service, but I didn't have a computer.It is not particularly soundproof: I could hear the TV from the adjoining room - but my neighbours were all discrete and well-behaved.Staff were efficient and helpful; some details brought to their attention (air conditioner on the blink, loose shower head) were fixed immediately.The neighbourhood is quiet - the St. Charles streetcar is still in its post-Katrina recovery period - and since the free parking lot behind the hotel was often full, or because the spaces were narrow and cramped and I was in an unfamiliar rental car, I generally parked on quiet streets behind the hotel with no problem.Apart from what I paid through an internet package (flight, hotel and car), there is a $5/day local surcharge for services.The chain to which this hotel belongs (Choice Hotels) does not give frequent flyer points to those on discount packages.There is a relatively expensive restaurant (evenings) operating in the hotel (I didn't try it).

I experienced 3 different rooms and can say they definitely vary in this hotel. The first room I was given, 306, was very nice. It was a very large room with new furniture including a desk and a recliner. There was a new, modern alarm clock/radio/CD player that sounded great. Since the room was only on the 3rd floor, the view wasn't as great as from the upper floors, but looking out over St Charles Av wasn\u9225\u6a9b bad either. On my 3rd day there, the toilet overflowed. The bathroom floor was risen above the rest of the floor about an inch or two so the water and sewage came out of the bathroom and poured onto the carpet. I called the main desk and was told that my room would be changed. When I got to the desk, I was told there was a problem. There were no other single rooms available and I would have to be put into a double in the morning and single again in the afternoon.The next room I was given, 812, wasn't very good. It was a double with a great view of the Superdome and downtown New Orleans. However, the chain lock was missing from the door. The room was small and with 2 beds seemed cramped. The table in the room was falling apart and the bathtub had a very slow drain. There were no towels.I was ultimately put into room 921 which had an okay view looking out over the Garden District. The room was large, although not as large as 306, but the furniture and its placement weren't as nice. There was a couch and a cheap alarm clock. Many small crooked pictures on the walls. The lighting in the room wasn't very good and I had difficulty working at the desk at night.The front desk staff were fine - no problems with them. One of the elevators was out so I ended up taking the stairs a lot, even when I was put on the 9th floor. The parking is free; however, it does not seem there are enough spaces for all guests. The hotel is on the eastern tip of the Garden District with some not so great neighborhoods close by so street parking always felt iffy to me. I parked in a fire zone one night and spent 2 hours looking out the window waiting for a spot to become available.I don't want to focus on the negatives. Overall, it's a nice hotel, especially if you score the right room, and a great value. The free parking alone makes it a great choice!

The hotel has seen its day, and showed signs of wear (lobby chair cushions are quite worn), but it is in an excellent location (the Garden District is beautiful), I felt safe, and it was quiet. The Garden District has an old South feel, mint julep, Scarlett O'Hara feel, and this hotel was the closest I could afford to get to the obvious wealth in the area. I read about the Resort fee and the elevator in other reviews, and it was all true. The elevator (only one working for 9 floors of rooms) was rickety, but worked. I only had to wait a long time for the elevator once, and that was during checkout (it was landing short of the floor, and had to be shutdown for a couple of hours to be adjusted). The room was clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable and I had one down-feather pillow! The air was cold and quiet. The carpets seemed clean, but I always wear houseshoes, so that wasn't an issue for me. The towels were above average. The TV worked, and the linens were clean. My room faced Jackson (on the side of the hotel) so street noise was minimal. The room had a stale smell when I arrived, but once I brought my own smells in, it was much fresher.I never ate at the restaurant in the hotel. Next door is a small market that has everything a tourist needs...hot breakfast in the morning (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, etc.) for about $5 and a nice lunch menu. A door from there is a bar/restaurant that has a great menu with New Orleans favorites (gumbo, etoufee, smothered chicken/porkchops, mustard greens, etc.). There are many other restaurants down the block to choose from as well.The St. Charles trolley wasn't running, which was a disappointment, and won't be running until 2008.

Note, if you are handicapped YOU WILL NOT BE ACCOMMODATED. When planning to stay in New Orleans on the way back from visiting family in Canada, I figured the Garden District Hotel was a safe bet - I'd stayed here about five years ago, and it was a lovely experience. Well, as they say, things change. The trouble began before we even arrived here; earlier in the day before we got to the hotel, we called to make sure we could get a room on the second floor (there are no first floor rooms) since my mother is handicapped and would not be able to walk down many flights of stairs if there was an emergency or the elevator did not work. The first person I spoke to, a young woman, was extremely rude and put me on the phone with someone else named Michael without even telling me she was going to do so. Michael was incredibly rude about the whole thing and told me he'd make NO accommodations for us until I mentioned that I'd spoken to Gerald, the general manager. Suddenly, there was a room on the second floor when Michael had told me flat out that there was nothing below the fourth floor and there was nothing he could or would do. We unpacked and got in the room - I am now terrified of the elevators, they are incredibly rickety and cracking. There are reddish brown (blood?) flecks ALL over the walls, the carpet is dirty (the bottoms of my previously clean feet are now black), and there was actually a condom in the bedside table. Nice! I'm glad my husband and I didn't have children with us! Later, we came to parking. Gerald told us that there was a $20 fee for valet parking, which is how things were several years prior. Well, Gerald lied - there IS no valet parking. You must park yourself, and if all the spaces are taken, you must park on the street. If all THOSE spaces are taken, well, you are SOL, just as Shawn, the night desk worker, told me when I asked him where I should park since there was no parking in the lot or on the street. He told me to keep driving around, that we'd have to find somewhere to park, and I remarked that if people had parked correctly in the lot without taking up five or six spaces, or if they had kept valet parking, there would be no problem. He then threw up his hands and angrily said Well, what do you want ME to do about it? I looked at him and said this hotel was not what it used to be, to which he agreed, and I walked outside. My mother, angry about this, decided to come in. Shawn interrupted and spoke over both of us and denied having said anything rude to me - he said that he'd asked me how he could help me, rather than a flippant What do you want me to do about it. He also said he'd have been more than willing to help us, but then I accused him of being rude, so he wasn't going to help us now. We told him the general manager Gerald had told us there would be valet parking, and that my mother is handicapped and cannot walk long distances and had been assured that everything would be okay. He then waved us off and told us to park in Gerald's space, and if Gerald had a problem with it he'd direct him to us. Well, we took Shawn up on his offer (something he didn't expect us to do) and let the security officer know that Shawn told us to park there so we didn't get towed. As of this writing, I'm sacrificing my sleep to make sure we do not get towed.We had paid $300 for two nights.

I informed Mr. Glover that I didn't want I refund, I only wanted a credit that could be used at a later date, I could fax a copy of my interview appointment if necessary. Mr. Glover informed me that there was nothing he could do. I asked for the corporate address and he told me that the hotel was the corporate office (they are independently owned). I was shocked that he wouldn\u9225\u6a9b even allow me to come at another time. At this point I realized that the $313.00 I spent booking this hotel was lost simply because life isn't perfect and unforeseen circumstances arise. I know that most people are willing to take chances and see for themselves, but BEWARE this hotel will not work with you if something unexpected happens. Ask yourself if your life is perfect before you book.

Some of my guests were told that there were no more rooms blocked off for my weeding, some were told they had reservations, only to find out later they did not. My aunt called 3 times to book a room, and then when I called to confirm, guess what....no room. The week before the wedding I was in touch with the new sales manager no less than once a day confirming rooms. Each day a different list of reservations appeared. Finally on the day before we would arrive, I felt everything was good to go. At least that is what the sales manager told me repeatedly. But on Friday, when all of my guests were scheduled to arrive....guess what.... some of my guests STILL had no rooms. And to top it all off, they had overbooked, so they began WALKING my guests to another hotle. Because of this fiasco, I spent the night trying to fix all of this and so nicely missed my OWN Rehearsal dinner! The front desk was very nice, but had no clue what was going on, and the sales manager (which by the way I never saw) was contacted by phone, but basically threw her hands up and kept telling me over the phone that it was right.

The free ferry ride is good..not a lot to do over on the other side, but the Dry Dock Cafe had lunch and drinks....we relaxed away from the hustle and bustle and did MANY drinks and 3 meals for less than $35!! Good deal. Magazine Street has great shopping in certain areas and the Columns Hotel is a nice relaxing place for a drink/coffee in the middle of the day.", "Date": "Dec 30, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR672428839", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not Happy with this hotel! My husband and I stayed at this hotel December 5-8 2003. I was not very happy with this place at all. The first day we had no wash clothes and asked for them over and over. The next day after housekeeping came we had neither wash clothes or towels. And took repeated attempts to get them as well. We had booked and paid three months in advance with continental breakfast supposed to be part of our package which was not offered. But we were told to eat in their high priced restaurant. When I checked out I asked for compensation for not having the breakfast and asked for it to be taken off our parking bill. And they argued with me and after 10 minutes reluctantly gave me 18.00 off. I would not stay here again. The drains in the bathtub were very slow to drain, and the hotel fixtures were in disrepair. It was not that clean either. I read the other reviews here and that made me choose it, because it was rated highly by others. I found it was not worth it, and would not stay there again", "Date": "Dec 19, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR711451525", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Disappointed   showReview(1517869, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 15, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR842307651", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Garden District Hotel, a good deal   showReview(1422933, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 27, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR854822967", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dpoole6131"}, {"Content": "Fab location clean rooms   showReview(1229156, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 15, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR769287019", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Garden District Hotel   showReview(1108153, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 25, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR424253329", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "friendly staff   showReview(941847, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 17, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR872449607", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "What rich History.......   showReview(913764, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 12, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR106293939", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel   showReview(857766, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 16, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR981898462", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "indigogirl1976"}, {"Content": "Perfect !!   showReview(751525, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 13, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR920819212", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Location -- Great Service   showReview(738702, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 2, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR521193265", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Pleasently surprised   showReview(644617, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 30, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR995084675", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "vertretbar wenn auch mit Makel   showReview(14737371, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR136236555", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9288\u5098\u5125\u9289\u51a6\u5114\u9288\u509a\u7c1d\u9286\u546b\u4efa...   showReview(19926821, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 25, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR522351229", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d93185-r14590970-Clarion_Collection_Garden_District_Hotel-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "93185", "Price": "$147"}}

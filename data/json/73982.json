The next day we were headed to another destination, and thank goodness for that! The shuttle service to the Days Inn was very touch and go from the airport. Although the driver himself was friendly, the hotel staff did not notify him of our pickup in a timely manner which left us waiting at the airport much longer than expected after a late flight. Once we arrived at the hotel, the service was incredibly cold and upon entering the room we were shocked at its condition. At first it was difficult to tell if the room had even been cleaned as pillows seemed to have just been thrown on the bed. Thankfully, the room at least smelled clean even though the air conditioner didn't work well and there were cracks running from one wall to the other. The next morning while checking out, a woman and her two young children entered the lobby after having just seen their room. The woman said \"This place is disgusting- there is no way we are staying in that room.\" She proceeded to ask reception for a cab to take her to another hotel. That pretty much sums up our experience. As for the cost, I don't consider $90 cheap for a room in this condition, surrounded by what seemed to be a very seedy neighborhood. I have never written a hotel review before, but this experience needed to be shared. Due to this hotel, I will not be staying at another Days Inn again.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado, United States", "Title": "\u201cYikes!\u201d", "Author": "Jaime M", "ReviewID": "UR127149111", "Content": "My boyfriend and I went to Phoenix on a quick business/vacation trip. We have stayed at Days Inns (other locations) before they have been pretty nice for motels. We booked the motel for 4 days and that was a mistake. First, thing we noticed was the horrible location. It is surrounded by strip clubs (the really gross kind), trashy motels, and a prison about a block away. People staying there seemed to be nice and mistaken travelers like us, but it appeared more like the place you would take a prostitute (no joking). The staff was friendly, but kind of short with guest. The lobby/check-in building looked nice, new furniture, and a small business center, with an ancient computer. We didn't even brother with the crappy free breakfast. The room looked clean at first, but on closer inspection was really gross. The bed did seem to have fresh sheets, but there were a few stains and lots of wholes. The pillows were gross and flat, meaning they have not been replaced in a long time. The furniture looked nice but was really cheap, I sat my small travel bag on the table and it wobbled and almost broke. The bathroom was the worst. The tub was gross and stained. They tried to cover it with a white rubber mat but you could still see it. The tub had hairs in it (EWWW!!). They window was gross and cover in dead flies. And they didn't even bother putting a new roll of toilet paper in. We ended up staying one night because we had to. The next day I found family members to stay with for the rest of the trip. The hotel would not refund our money. What a waste.

I only got probably two or three hours of sleep and the loud bangs of people opening and closing their doors throughout the night drove me nuts.

My friend and I decided to try this location due to the internet photo with the pool and the brand reputation for this motel chain. Okay, the room was filthy. There was a large hole in and other areas of the carpet raised and mushy (not wet). There were burns and holes on the ironing board. There was rust on most metal surfaces in bathroom and large holes in the wall above the light fixture. They have iron bars on the bathroom window with a view of the low income apartment/motel front doors only 30 to 40 feet away. The lamp shades were dirty and broken. The dresser was old and too small for the size of the room. Besides the filthy walls throughout, there were large cracks. Some cracks had been filled but had not even been painted over. There was no fridge, microwave, or coffee maker in our room. There was a bad, musty odor from the A/C unit and the filter was nasty (my friend developed strep throat and I also got a bad respiratory infection although it could've been from the front desk person who was very ill. She was using the lobby guest computer often and also set up the continental breakfast the next day. She coughed a lot and never once covered her mouth or sanitized her hands in our presence). There appears to be permanent dwellers onsite with very dirty covered and not covered vehicles in the lot. These vehicles appear to have not been moved in many months at least. The large areas which used to be a pool and picnic area are just dirt and weeds with some palm trees and a couple of old, unmaintained BBQs. There were piles of ashes (from the barbeques?) being dumped in the dirt filled old pool. In the morning, there was trash and beer cans strewn around the parking lot and near the rooms (it was all still there when we left at 1030am). There was dead shrubbery along the walkway outside of rooms. Our beds were clean and very comfortable. This is a great ghetto place if all you want is a bed for 60 dollars a night. You also get a strip club right across the road, porn shops nearby and a drive-thru liquor store 2 blocks away.

What a horrible place this hotel was at. As we got closer and closer, we felt the area became more degenerate. No lie or exaggeration, but as we were going to the hotel, we saw crack wh0res on the the corner, stares from people standing outside in the streets with their shirts off, and loud music blasting from old beat up cars. Upon arrival the hotel is directly across from a run down strip joint, as seen from the outside. Checkin was fine, the room was ok for what I expected for $35 a night. With the exception of the bathroom. The window would not shut and remained open but its ok because there were metal bars on the window, so no one could enter/escape. The bathroom was dirty but the icing on the cake was the stale sitting water that was underneath the plastic form material on the floor of the tub. It felt like you were standing on a water bed. The WORST part of that was the awful smell of that sitting water mixed with god know what else that's been sitting there for who knows how long. It was so bad that I tried to hold my breath as often as I could. If you don't shower you would have never know because the smell starts as you step into the tub and the water moves around. When the water is turned on, it only adds to the sitting water beneath the tub. I feel sorry for the person the day it busts and horrible smelling and bacteria infested water spills out onto the person bathing. Other than that and being in a run down ghetto area in Phoenix, the staff was nice and shuttled us to and from the airport by the live in driver. The gentleman at night was nice but the Russian lady at checkout was just whatever, no personality, no smile, nothing at all from her, no having a nice day, thanks for staying, NOTHING.

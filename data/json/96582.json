We then got to the unit and it smelled HORRID. On a day that was 105 degrees, the next thing was that the air conditioning unit that was jimmy rigged into the wall in the main bedroom with ceiling tile didnt work! We went back to see if the front desk might be able to help out with perhaps a different unit as we understood that no 2 are the same as they are individually owned or something like that, but there was nothing available until the next morning as the others were not clean. Luckily we went via the Tourisim Branson to do our plans - the manager Monica went above and beyond to find us something that we were willing to stay in in town that was nice. It wasnt the condo type set up we were dreaming of - but being it was the week of the 4th of July, she did excellent and saved our vacation from disaster. I would NOT recommend this set up as it is a gamble as to what you will end up getting.

What you get in one unit may not apply in another. With that being said, I enjoyed staying at Pointe Royale. Our unit was unit number 4 in building number 57 on Highland Drive. The unit was two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and located on the ground floor, and was rented through VRBO.com The unit had been remodeled with new furnishings, mattresses, paint, and kitchen counters. It was very clean. The master room had a Jacuzzi/shower combo. Both bedrooms had king-sized beds with small, flat paneled televisions. I thought the value was great. With tax, cleaning fee, and all, a four night stay in April for four people was only around 500.00. Pointe Royale is also a gated community with friendly and informative security guards, on-site dining, swimming, close proximity to attractions, and a golf course right in the community. For the most part, the area was very quiet. My complaints are minor. We had some water issues one day. My father-in-law had some trouble getting warm water. And then, that night, the water system behind the condo began to buzz. It sounded like a school bell and was very loud. We called maintenance and the issue was looked into with an hour. They were working on it the next morning and we had no more water trouble. The couch in the living room is just a hard little loveseat. The television was small and the furnishings were not arranged so that all people seated could watch the screen. And, lastly, the new mattress was somewhat hard. Both my husband and I did not sleep very well. But, considering the location, security, cleanliness, and price, I really don't feel justified in complaining.

After a long enjoyable day in Branson (loved the town), we went back to the condo only to find hair and a stain in the bed. It was the grosses thing that I have ever experienced with a hotel/condo. Talking with the night manager we found out there were no other rooms available for us to change and if I did not already pay online I would have changed to a hotel. The night manager was very understanding and sympathetic toward the situation and did his best with the authority he had. We decided to sleep on the fold out couch that turned out to be very uncomfortable. Although we wanted to get to Silver Dollar City first thing we decided to wait for the day manager\u2019s call. I called at 9:30am expecting the manager but she was playing a round of golf. They must have called her because I did receive a call around 10am and said she was sorry for the issue. She said she would have house cleaning come and change the sheets. Because of the first impression of the bed we did not want to sleep in that bed and we requested another room. They said they had issues with the cleaning crew the last couple of weeks. It seemed we were more of an inconvenience for her, complete opposite of the night manager. She did comp the room for the first night and provide our family with 4 show tickets only after I told her of how much this was an inconvenience to us. Other issues we experienced in the first room are it smelled like smoke and the kitchen light worked sometimes, noisy neighbors and a loud air conditioning unit. The second room was very nicely decorated and overall clean. It also had a loud air condition unit so I would assume it was an overall problem with the condos. We also were awoken at 8am by maintenance pressure washing the condos. As they say first impression is everything, we were very disappointed in Point Royal first impressions of their room and the day manager customer service skills could use some customer relations training. Although I am sure others have had a very enjoyable experience at Point Royal ours was not.

The staff was very accomodating as we had driven 10 hours from Louisiana and arrived after the office was scheduled to close. The staff kept the office open a little longer until we arrived. Our unit was roomy enough for husband, myself and two boys ages 8 and 9. Living area has a sleeper sofa but we used air mattresses from home for the kids. There is a TV in the living area and bedroom so kids could watch one set and grown ups had the other. Full kitchen with stove and microwave and the surprise was a washer and dryer in the unit! This came in handy for washing towels, wet swimsuites and other laundry. Our unit building was next to the pool and clubhouse. The decor is a bit outdated (1980's) but the unit was very clean and well maintained. This was far better than staying in a boxy motel room on the strip! The price was a bit higher but so worth it for the convenience. The only negatives were that we paid for a condo with a view of the golf course but ours was a first level unit with a patio instead of a balcony and we were on the end so our veiw was partially obstructed by a concrete wall. Definately will request a different building next time. There were also a few small ants crawling about the floor in the living area. We reported this as we checked out and were told it would be taken care of. The location is off of the strip and the resort is huge, much larger than it seems from the road. If you want to stay near the Branson action, this is not the best location. It was fine for us as we came this trip to visit Silver Dollar City and to just relax in the condo.

We stayed at a lovely 2 bedroom at Pointe Royale. It is wonderful as it provides privacy, yet you are minutes from the heart of Branson. 165 ( Fall Creek Road) connects you to any place that you need to be. Pointe Royale has a large outdoor pool, a zero entry kids pool, an indoor heated pool and a hottub. It also has a restaurant on site, and beautiful 18 hole golf course. The club house has a fitness room. Our Condo had WiFi. Restaurants are nearby. The Condo's have full facilities to cook and eat in the Condo or you can get it to go and bring it back with you. Enjoy a movie or Game while you have a Danna's burger or Pasta from Tony Z's. The Country Mart at 65 & 165 has anything you could need from basics to high end gourmet. Jubilee is a nice store but does not have the variety. You will also find fast food at this square & a Blockbuster. It is an example of never going onto the strip if that's not your thing. Prices vary on these condo's and I highly recommend shopping around if time allows. Some are much nicer than others. This was the 13th Condo we have stayed in at Pointe Royale. All are different, all were nice, amenities vary from Condo to Condo. All have a washer & dryer. Ask about TV's, Cable, Internet, DVD players. Some are more child friendly than others.

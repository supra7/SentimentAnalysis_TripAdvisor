This was a timeshare exchange for us...this was \"girls\" week. Upon checking in, I learned that Interval had made an error and cancelled our stay..long story but no need to go there. After being introduced to the Operations Manager, John Betros, and being told we had no reservation and he was at 100% capacity...I thought well I guess I'll be driving back to Jacksonville...only 2 hours away but big disappointment for the \"girls\". Mr. Betros took it upon himself and spent the time to rectify the problem. We were able to stay in a 1BR the first night (there were only 2 of us at that time) and the next day we were able to move into a 2BR lockoff so everyone had plenty of space. Both units 601 and 702/a were nicely appointed and clean. But the management and staff had no idea how they helped me...you see my mom (83) has some health issues and I am the caregiver...I needed this time away so thank you DBR for making it happen for us! The staff everywhere was always friendly...even the burger from the Tiki Bar was very good. Easy access to the beach and being after Labor Day the crowds were gone and it was just a great overall experience. This resort wants you to have a good stay - we were there for down time and relaxing on the beach so we really didn't use the amenities so can't comment on that.

I requested early check-in (knowing that our flight was going to be in earlier than 3pm) and also requested oceanfront view. Of course \"not guaranteed\", but they said they would take our request into consideration & \"it shouldn't be a problem\". When we arrived at 11:15, we were told our room wasn't available but they would call our cell when ready. Sounding as if it would be a short period. At 2:30, we still hadn't received a call so we went back to the resort and when I approached the front desk to inquire about our room..the girl just shook her head (no) & said \"not ready yet\". We proceeded to wait in the lobby until 3:45 before our room was ready! (not pleased!) Upon entering the room, we found it was very spacious and the beds (not the pull-out) were VERY comfortable. The pull-out was impossible to sleep on. The fully equipped kitchen was nice especially since we were staying so long, we had planned to have breakfast & some lunches in the room. The room itself, on a \"cleaning\" scale, was a 3/10. The baseboard & vents were disgusting-see for yourself. We arrived on Saturday and by Thursday, we still had no cleaning service in our room. I ended up speaking with the GM (regarding another issue) and he advised they don't offer cleaning daily, it's 'suppose' to be after 4 days (clearly it was longer than 4 days). Our view from the balcony was the hotel next door & their dumpsters. During our stay, we found out this is a timeshare place, so don't expect an oceanfront room unless you own a timeshare at this resort. The pool was fantastic & very clean and the Tiki Bar was awesome!! (Make sure you take care of Mike & Amanda in there!!) One afternoon, the 'security' guard approached me while I was laying out at the pool and asked where my wrist-band was. I proceeded to take it out of my camera bag & put it under my hand (as I didn't want a tan line around my wrist). He said that I needed to WEAR it, that putting it under my hand wasn't sufficient and proceeded to say \"I would hate to throw you out of the pool area for not putting the band on\". I said the band was UNDER MY HAND & he could CLEARLY SEE IT!! He walked away and came back about a half hour later and said he checked with management and they said that having it under my hand was fine. (Good-because if I'm paying to stay at your resort for 8 days, I don't need to be tagged like an animal!!) He said they were having problems with 'beach-goers' coming up and accessing the pool...maybe they should fix their magnetic gates & only people that have room keys would be able to access their pool?? Seems that would be a good suggestion! Even after talking with the GM and expressing my concerns regarding the pool incident and the cleaning service, we wouldn't be back to this resort. It served the purpose as we were basically only in our room to sleep, but not the quality we had hoped for and anticipated after reading reviews.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Florida", "Title": "\u201cgreat family resort!\u201d", "Author": "Debbie M", "ReviewID": "UR139395430", "Content": "Rooms are exceptionally large and if you add the lock- out unit it's great for large family's, or grandma and grampa can come along too.

The room itself was well appointed with a full, well-equipped kitchen, thick towels in the bathroom, and a comfy bed. Fortunately, we had a northern view, and the view from the large windows in the bedroom was beautiful! Four complaints: 1) Bird droppings on the balcony. I notified the staff, and they came up, but only did a minimal job cleaning the droppings. There was no way anyone would want to sit in either chair even after the cleaning. 2) The cleaning staff did not clean around our toilet, and it smelled of urine. We notified the front desk, and they sent deodorizing spray. It did not help. 3) Our room was not cleaned the entire time we were there. We were told our room would be cleaned on Wednesday. Didn't happen. We had to call the front desk and ask for towels just to get a shower before 6 PM. 4) The pool and pool area were FILTHY. The pool was being cleaned on Monday morning, 7/23. When we left, the pool area had not been touched again, other than trash cans were emptied. The pool had scum around the tiles, diaper crystals (the crystals disposable diapers have in them to absorb moisture), bird feathers, and bugs adorning it. The sand was not washed off at the beach showers during this entire time. On a good note: 1) The Tiki Bar was SUPER! The staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! 2) The fitness center was very well appointed. 3) The underground, gated parking was safe and secure.

Ok back to the hotel, receptionists are very nice and helpful. Due to the weather, the staff offered a variety of activities for children, as well as, adults. I do have to admit that this is the hotel for families with children. They have an indoor pool and spa, fitness center, and game room. There are vending machines for small accommodation such as detergent, sunscreen, floss, and medication. There is also a small lounge for parents to relax a bit and surf the net. The great outdoors involve a pool with a water slide and a jacuzzi. Of course there is a beautiful sandy beach right pass the gates. There are plenty of lounge chairs for you to relax and read a book. The tiki bar is also located outside too. The room was wonderful and comfortable. It was very \"home-like\" with a flat screen TV in the living room and DVD player ( I think there's a blue-ray player too). The couch is a pull-out bed for your extra guests. The kitchenette is stocked with tableware and household utensils (plates, cups, bowls, pots, etc) I think it is a good idea to stop by a grocery store and stock up on food, more cost efficent since the rooms as everything you need to cook. The bedroom has a king size bed and another flat screen in the room, and an IPOD dock to charge your IPhone. The bathroom was clean, but the shower was intense with pressure. They have small bottles of toiletries for your convenience and extra toilet paper and towels as well. The bathroom is also spacious. I absolutely love this hotel!

The smoked Mahi-Mahi dip is very good. The burgers are big and good. Philly cheesesteak is also good. The bartender in the pool bar cooks your food right there so it is very fresh. The drinks are good but not enough booze for my taste, but the Voodoo drink was decent. Most of the time we took our own beer, and bought a drink or two.

Through it all, the staff was super friendly and apologetic and determined to make us comfortable. We asked to be moved to another suite in the morning, and they happily agreed and gave us another suite with a nicer view of the north part of the beach. The pool is fabulous, the corkscrew slide is a blast, and if they had a bed in the pool bar, that's where we would have stayed. You can't beat the location, the congeniality of the staff, and we will DEFINITELY return next year.

The first stay provided us with an apartment on the 8th floor, overlooking the parking lot and front entrance, but because of the vacant lot next to the hotel, we had a good view of the ocean and beach from our balcony. Unfortunately, for our second stay, we were given an apartment on the second floor, looking at, and situated above the dumpsters of the hotel next door. When we asked to be moved, we were told this wasn't a possibility, so the noise from emptying the dumpsters was our alarm clock in the morning! The hotel's location provides many different eating and shopping options, as well as an entertainment pier withing walking distance. Our stays were too short to visit the amusement area, although I'm sure this is something the children would have loved to do. The hotel's location on the beach, and the adjacent pool area, caused us a delay in the morning, as we planned to leave during our first stay, because the children (and my husband) \"accidentally\" got caught in the surf, and finished off (since they were already wet) in the pool!!!

We wanted a 2 bedroom suite with a full kitchen. We had stayed at the DBR on one other occasion in 2005 and were pleased with our stay, even though they were doing remodeling at the time and it could be very noisy. We made our reservations 2 months before leaving and made the reservations through the hotel website due to the fact that we had 1 special request; we asked that our room be on no higher than the 4th floor (there are issues with heights and elevators). When we finally found our way in (still being remodeled 6 years later and the front is not clearly marked) and checked-in we were informed our room was not only above the 4th floor but they had managed to put us the 9th floor (there are only 11) and that we didn't get the room we wanted because we didn't check-in earlier. First of all, we checked in at 5 p.m. so it wasn't long after the time we were suppose to check-in. Second, we had a reservation for 2 months and they knew about the request at that time. We had in no way given any sort of impression that we were not going to show up so why was it so difficult to insure there was a room available on one of the floors we had indicated ready for us just because of the time we checked in. When we were informed of this we immediately let the desk clerk know this simply would not be acceptable. The clerk told us that they would gladly move us to another room when one became available in 2-3 days. Our stay was only 6 days and that would mean we would have to unpack, go get groceries and tolerate going up and down stairs or tolerate long elevator trips, repack and unpack again. This was absolutely crazy to ask of someone, in my opinion. It wasn't until we told them that since we did not find this \"solution\" acceptable and wanted a full refund on our stay that they managed to work out something where we could get a room on a lower level the next day. We were still not happy but it was better than having to search for a new place after we had already gotten there. We felt like prisoners that first night because 9 floors is entirely too many stairs to climb, the elevator ride was too long and we couldn't even enjoy our balcony because every time I walked out my knees would get weak. The rooms were nice but the cleanliness of the room left a lot to be desired. The grout in the shower in the main room was completely black from mold and the jet tub, in the second room, had mold in the jets (I could only imagine what else was in there if there was mold). I went out and bought a bottle of bleach spray and a scrub brush to clean the shower and tub with and spent a good 2 hours of our vacation cleaning just so I could feel clean after a shower. All I have to say is \"Never again!\" Never again will my family nor I subject themselves to this form of stress at the hands of this hotel. This was our one family vacation for the year (which we haven't had in several years) and a lot of it was spent very stressed out over something that should have NEVER been an issue in the first place. Here's hoping if you decide to stay there your stay is a lot better than ours! Also if you are a laptop user and want to use the internet make sure you have a smart phone that is internet capable for your computer. The internet is so slow that my computer would usually time out before a web page would load.

The view down was the service alley for the next building, and frequently we could hear them unloading trucks and dumping trash, but we could also hear kids splashing and squealing in the kids pool of the nextdoor property. No view of our building's pool or beach area, though. The single lockout had a two-burner stove, no oven, bar sink, undercounter fridge (didn't use it); the bedroom had a queen bed with the roman style jacuzzi tub next to it. Bathroom was ample, with a shower only, but lots of cabinet space. The closet was rather small, as it also housed the air handler, and the hangers hit the doors when they were opened/closed.

The balcony was off of the living room. We saw pigeons on the balcony on occasion, but no messes. Flat screen TV in each bedroom and living room. Kitchen had service for six. Air conditioning worked very well, but the air handlers in the closets made for really noticing when it turned on and off.

It was clean and nicely updated in terms of decor and furnishings and amenities. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and the resort itself (while small - not a bad thing!) was overall very nice. It has a good fitness center, which I used every morning. One of the nice things about the fitness center is that it had restrooms, water, towels and antiseptic wipes to use on all the machines (how rare is that?!?), as well as a flat screen TV to watch. Music was also piped in to exercise along to. The resort only has 11 floors (which is what I mean by small), and is next door to a very large and nice Wyndham Ocean Watch, but by comparison, the Regency was just great, with no long waits for elevators or crowds. I would recommend you ask for a room on the north side (if you can't get ocean front), as the views from this side are nicer (the Wyndham blocks some of the views from the south side) They also have a nice little game room, with a foosball and pool table, as well as electronic games (we didn't use this, but nice to know it's there), and offer some activities for kids evidently. They also have a concierge, who is just that (not a thinly veiled timeshare salesperson), who called us the first morning and provided us with brochures and suggestions - a nice touch. The beach is fabulous and we spent all our time out there, as it is just a few steps directly from the resort and it was easy to carry out beach stuff. We usually just hang at the pool area, but as the beach was very appealing and so easy to access, we actually preferred to spend our time there. We brought along beach towels, but the resort provided nice beach towels themselves, so we didn't even need to use ours. This was nice to have, especially if you forgot to bring them. And, just a couple of blocks down, is the ocean walk area, with a theater and restaurants.

Trust me, we read them all! The price was so valuable we were willing to gamble and we are so glad that we did! Check in: Went very well. Our flight arrived early and our room wasn't available but we were given an access key to roam the property. Room: Our room was not ocean front as we had requested but it was ocean view (1007/1007A). I am not sure how you go about getting these as I was told there is only (9) available total. When we went up to our room housekeeping was cleaning an ocean front next to ours so we did wonder why we couldn't have been placed there as a family arrived after we did and received that room. Putting that aside... I will say our view was still great and the room was VERY clean and NO odors as others have mentioned. The place was extremely roomy and was stocked with everything you need for a vacation. The linens, kitchen accessories, pots/pans, blender, toaster, coffee maker. Full size refrig/stove in the main kitchen and half sized appliances in the second kitchen. It was every thing we needed and more. We even had a hot tub in our room and our own bathroom while the kids had their own separate room/bathroom which was fantastic! The place was fantastic for the value... seriously this 2 bedroom suite was amazing!! Pools: Inside pool is very small but it works for the little ones... hot tub is nice... Outside pool is not large but it certainly accommodated everyone. Please be mindful the pool slide is NOT for small children without supervision. My husband was not a big fan of the inability to \"catch\" your child at the end of the slide as the current was hard to work through. Kids love it but be cautious. Lounge chairs: Very nice chairs.. only complaint is the lack of umbrellas in this area. If you sat next to the bar you were fine but if one party wanted to lay out in the sun and the other wanted shade you had to separate... Gas grills: Located on the patio for your own personal usage.. Fantastic idea! Tiki bar: Good food and reasonably priced... Activities: This was great... for a very small fee your children could participate in activities.. kids loved it.. and they had things for adults too Beach: AWESOME.. AWESOME.. AWESOME! Very clean.. and we spent a lot of time here with the kids.. We did rent the umbrella/chairs from beach vendors just to get the umbrella. It's $30 a day but for us it was worth it as the kids wanted the sand/ocean but we had to have some shade too. Food vendors on the beach... Very clean/nice... but food is a little bit pricey... typical picnic foods.. burgers/fries/dogs/soda Safety: We felt VERY safe and never had any concerns in the property, on the beach, or walking the strip. We had (3) small children with us and never once felt insecure. Staff: Very friendly... always spoke and smiled at you! Job well done! Elevators.. It's true as most reviews read.. they are super slow and if your room is on the 10th floor like ours.. kind of hard to truck up 10 flights with 3 little peeps at toe but it wasn't horrible by any means. All in all this was a fantastic vacation and we would certainly go back without hesitation! Caution... it's obviously a hot spot for spring breakers... We arrived 3/30 and returned 4/7 and it was perfect because college season was \"over\"....

They had everything except toothpaste, toothbrush, and floss. Also, it had a fully stocked (dishes & towels) kitchen for cooking.

Not wet really, but just enough to make your socks stick to your feet. There was a large LCD TV in the living room and the couches were decently comfortable. The bed was also decently comfortable. The bathrooms was a bit strange with only a stall shower that was as wide as full bath tub shower. The shower curtain that did not go all the way to the bottom of the stall and it was a cheap looking shower head that you can hold onto. The bathroom was almost too spacious and made me feel like there was wasted space in the room. The balconies were under closed due to maintenance, this is understandable, but the front desk person said we would have \"great\" views anyway. The view outside the living room was the A1A highway and outside the bedroom was the Wyndam hotel and maybe some beach if you looked at just the right angle.

Not the case on the other side of the building, where we stayed in a somewhat darker 2-bedroom unit that overlooked a \"skyscraper.\" The room itself was clean, comfortable and well stocked, but our unit did have a funny odor which my husband decided was \"cake batter deodorizer.\" Yeah, EW, but not a dealbreaker for us. The mattresses were awesome, but earlier review about the balconies being literally blanketed in pidgeon poop are completely true. Not a real problem, though, since we thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the beachside patio area. The staff never seemed at all put-out by our questions, concerns or requests, and our needs were always met promptly and courteously. The pool is sparkling, and my two kids (14 & 7) loved the slide. The ocean is the best feature about this property. We live just a few miles from a beach on Cape Cod, and somehow Daytona's powdery sand, warm water, and massive waves made us feel like we were experiencing something truly extraordinary. The Tiki Bar serves tasty food, great cocktails, and friendly service. A word about the Daytona area. It was dusk when we arrived, and the area felt a little \"sketchy.\" This is definitely not Marco Island or Naples, but if you're not snobby about it, then you will have a wonderful stay.

I spend weeks finding the right place for the right price. I read all the reviews, look at all the pics, make graphs, etc. I thought I had found the perfect place. BOY WAS I SO WRONG! I don't know what is wrong with the people who wrote all the other reviews! So we get there. Everything seems ok although the hotel looks pretty trashy next to the other (be it much more expensive) hotels. We walk in and it looks like all the pictures, but much smaller than expected. Still ok. Went up to the 2 room lock off suite and although the furnishings are like the pictures, the floor plan is not. Both rooms did not have a private bathroom. One did, the other was across a hallway (not much privacy). Ok, here is the bad stuff... One, there is an abandoned building next door and it is filled with homeless individuals. We decided to walk back to the hotel on the beach at about 3:00am from the bar. We walked up to the hotel from the beach and they had these huge chain locks on the gate (strange we thought until we found out why). So we began to walk around to the front when 2 guys asked us if we wanted anything illegal. We said no thanks and started to walk away when they started making comments about what they would like to \"do\" to me... Well there were 4 of us (2 guys, 2 girls) and we are not ones to ignore things like that, so my husband inquired about what they said... Next thing we knew, they were coming over the wall, up from the beach, around from behind us. All together there were about 12 of them. Although we like to fight, we were out numbered. After a few blows, we did get away and into the hotel. The next morning we asked the front desk about the building and the chain locks. We were told that they have been trying to get it torn down for years with no luck and \"DO NOT TAKE YOUR WOMEN ON THE BEACH AFTER 1:00am around it\". WTF, seriously!!!!! Two, the place was really dirty and I am not the picky clean freak. We stay in A LOT of hotels (like 2 a month) and this was by far the worst as far as cleanliness that I have ever seen. Really disappointing. The whirlpool bathtub looked clean so I filled it, got in and turned it on (bad idea). All this gunk came out of the jets, but I didn't notice until I turned them off. YUCK!! There was hair on floors, balcony looked like it was never cleaned, furniture was stained. Everyone kept making comments on the smell in the hallway (smelt like mildew). The smell in our room was worse though. Mildew, Mold, dirty sock smell. Bad. Three, they charge for EVERYTHING! You want coffee? $.75 per pack. Oh, you want cream and suger packs, $$ Forget a razor $$, make a call $$. Plus they only clean your room once a week. So if you are there for a weekend dont expect any service and they only leave 2 towels per room!!! Overall, this was the worst choice ever. There are so many more hotels in this area that are soooo much better, pay the little extra it will be worth it! I would say that the only good things about this hotel was the tiki bar (very cool) although there is another hotel bar just south of the peir that is much cooler!!

This is a timeshare resort, making it slightly different from a hotel - meaning you don't get daily housekeeping unless you pay extra for it. This bothers some people, to me, I'd rather have a roomy condo with a kitchen over someone to make my bed every morning and change my towels. Housekeeping comes once during the middle of the week, the day depends on which floor you are on. The resort is small - 11 stories consisting of efficiencies, one br units and two br units. There is a secure underground parking garage, with an above aground area for larger SUV's. You need your room key to get in and out of the garage. The resort has 24 hr. security. Staff is very friendly. There are no ground floor units and approx. 22 ocean front units. Units on the North side of the building have very nice ocean views. Units on the South side of the building basically have a view of the Ocean Walk parking garage/or Ocean Walk balconies (there is approx. 25 ft. between the buildings. There is a small indoor pool and hot tub as well as a small game room andvery small fitness room with a treadmill and two or three other machines. There is a nice heated outdoor pool with a slide. The lounge chairs are very nice and cushioned. Towels are provided in your unit for the pool. There are two gas grills available to use as well as a Tikii bar and snack bar oceanfront next to the pool. You have direct beach access through a locked gate (you need your key card to get in and out). Many times, people leave the gate open. Not so smart, because then anyone can enter the area from the beach - especially at night. It is located next to the Oceanwalk resort on the section of the beach where cars are not allowed (love that). So the beach is very safe for little ones to play on without having to worry about getting run over by a motorized vehicle! It is a short walk to the pier and the boardwalk. There is a small waterpark with an arcade, mini golf and go carts across the street from Ocean Walk. Can't beat the location! In Sept. I had a 1 br unit on the 5th floor on the North side. The unit was very small, but clean. The kitchen was so tiny that when you opened the oven or dishwasher, it almost touched the other (they were opposite each other). The kitchen was stocked with liquid dish soap, paper towels and trash bags as well as coffee maker, dishes, sliverware, glasses, pots and pans, etc. The bathroom was good size and connected to the kitchen and the br. It had a garden tub/shower combo, one sink vanity and toilet. The bedroom was nice size with a very comfy king bed, upholstered chair as well as a tv. There was also an alarm clock, radio, docking station for your I pod. The bedding and linens were superior! The family room was tiny with a small table with chairs (sufficient for 2 people). 2 more people could eat at the counter/bar area. The couch (sleeper sofa) was leather and there was another chair. I did not find the couch to be that comfortable, but it would do. The TV was flat screen and there was a stereo. The balcony was tiny/narrow with two chairs. Not really good for anything because the pigeons take it over - usually full of pigeon doo-doo (you can call to have it cleaned). In November I stayed in a two BR lockoff on the 8th floor on the South side. Great unit - crappy view. It was a 1 Br and an efficiency together, but the layout of the 1 BR was better/larger. Pretty much the same kitchen - living area was slightly larger with two chairs instead of one. The bathroom was across the hall from the BR and had a shower only. The efficiency was beautiful and larger. The bed was king size and the jacuzzi was in the bedroom. The bathroom was nice with the sink, shower and toilet. There was a small kitchenette also. In January, I stayed in a 1 BR on the 10th floor street front. I would not recommend these units because the street noise is horrible (and I was there during off-season). It seems you can hear the traffic through the walls. Other than that, I loved the layout. The unit was the entire width of the building along the street, with a balcony on the north and south sides. What spectacular views, especially at night. You could see across the inter coastal waterway! Small kitchen with a separate alcove for a small table with 4 chairs. Nice size living room. Nice master bedroom and large bathroom with a garden tub/shower combo. Overall, I like coming to this resort. I come to Daytona Beach four or more times a year now, and this is my first choice to stay. It is clean, convenient, beachfront and spacious. I am a timeshare owner (although this is not my home resort) and always stay at a timeshare when I come to Daytona.

The location is walking close to many restuarants and shops.A car ride will bring you to a grocery and many stores.It is a safe area to walk.

We had a great vacation. Check in was smooth and we were in our room on the 9th floor in no time. We had booked a one bedroom and this was quite adequate for the 2 of us. There was a balcony overlooking the beach and the same view from the bedroom, where you could lie in bed and watch the waves lapping the sand. It was so relaxing!!. The bed was very comfortable, and the lounge area had a comfortable sofa. There was no kettle in the kitchen, a necessity for us Brits who need their cups of tea, which we had brought from home, but a call to reception brought us one in a couple of minutes. In fact anything that we needed was provided speedily. The swimming pool and deck area were nice with new furniture. The Tiki bar was a definite plus. The various rum based cocktails went down very easily especially the Voodoo Juice!! Now to the negative. On our third day the outside hot tub broke down. We reported it to the reception staff and then went away for a couple of days expecting it to have been mended by the time we returned. No such luck. My husband finds that the heat and the bubbles really help his knees and back and he was upset that this facility was not available. Just to sit in a hot tub without the bubbles is like sitting in a bath and does not help at all. On the Friday the duty manager was asked by my husband when it would be working again and he said that on Monday it should be done. He took our room number and we supposed that he would contact us. We heard nothing. In the end we had to really hassle the guy and eventually it was mended on the Thursday after watching the maintenance guy trying so hard to mend it and getting an electric shock in the process. If only Lon, the duty manager, had bothered to leave a message to say that there were problems with the repair then he would have saved himself so much hassle. Communication is all. Other problems were that there is great emphasis put on wearing a band to show that you are staying at the property, but the gates to the beach or the car lot do not always lock after someone has gone out and so anyone can walk in. They are sensibly very hot on getting everyone out of the pool area when the summer thunderstorms are nearby. It was lovely to be able to walk ndown the beach each morning and the heat is not so bad here as there are lovely sea breezes.

The second room was a 2 bedroom suite. One cabinet corner was tore up. In our bedroom right above the whirlpool tub it was leaking. At times almost a complete downpour. Which was really annoying when trying to sleep. They had a guy come look at it but that was it. I was not impressed with front desk and they came off very snotty to me.

Let me just say that this vacation was so much fun with a mix of relaxing, sightseeing and hanging at the bar. I was able to find a great deal on this resort through Ebay and booked it for a long awaited vacation for just me and my husband. The hotel staff was very friendly. The suite was exactly what I would expect - we had a 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen, two baths, living and dining area, and ocean view. Our suite faced the Ocean Walk next door but that wasn't a problem. We still had a very nice view of the beach from the side. The pool area was the perfect size, and the water slide was tons of fun! I enjoyed many days laying out by the pool, reading a book or listening to music. The only problem with the pool was that the water was a little chilly - it's not heated. The indoor pool is not heated either, but I never ventured into that pool outside of sticking a foot in it. The other problem with the pool area was the construction going on, and the lack of use of the Tiki Bar area. I was really looking forward to hanging out in this area as I researched the resort to prepare for the trip. However, when we got to the resort we found the Tiki Bar closed. Luckily, construction only went on just two days while we were there. That made for the pool area to to be but so relaxing, but I just put my earbuds in and listened to music on my shuffle. The beach area was beautiful! The resort is very conveniently located within just blocks of the Ocean Walk Shoppes, the pier, a water park, dining and shopping. I really enjoyed walking to shops and eateries. My husband and I especially liked Bubba Gumps and the Mai Tai Bar - both of which are just a couple blocks away. We did have to attend a timeshare presentation one of the days at the resort. That was a little weird. We were originally told the meeting would be Wednesday morning, but when we checked in we had to change it. We picked Friday at 9 a.m., but that morning at 8:30 a.m. they wanted to switch our time to 11 a.m. I wasn't too thrilled about that time because it ate into my sunning time. Then we met our lady and she wasn't prepared for us. She thought my husband and I were owners and seemed a little flustered when we told her we weren't. We had a hard time getting information out of her about Diamond's timeshare system. When she presented us with the cost, and my husband and I weren't even sure what we would get with the points they wanted us to buy we said no thanks. They tried to offer us a different package but we were ready to get out of there. It was pretty much a waste of time. But it was just 90 minutes, no longer. Overall, I REALLY enjoyed our stay at the Daytona Beach Regency and I would go back (just never buy the timeshare!).

I was on my honeymoon. The week was going good. The condos are big in size and very spacy. The light over the bathtub burned out a day before we left and I had to flick the circuit breaker at times to get the AC going in the room. The worst part was that our DIGITAL CAMERA WAS TAKEN FROM OUR ROOM during our stay. It was taken anywhere from the last night we were there (8-12-07) until about 2pm the day we left (8-13-07) I know this camera was taken by someone with access to the room seeing that the doors lock automatically when they shut and I personally always check the door when I leave. I remember clearly that the camera was in the living room next to the couch. This is the story of my missing camera. We spent Sunday (8-12-07) next to the pool. I remember I took some pictures of my wife going down the hotel slide at approximately 5pm and not more than 5 minutes later we decided to go back to our room. My wife was feeling a little under the weather ( too much sun) so she layed down on the bed and I sat on the living area couch where I was reviewing our pictures of the week and thinking of how much fun we had. Shortly after looking at the pictures. I placed the camera next to the couch. I then grabbed my wallet, left the hotel and went accross the street to the stores to pick up some post cards and a few souvineers. I then returned to the condo to see how my wife was feeling. She said whe was still feeling a little ill and sleepy so I decided I would go down to the tiki lounge for a little bit. My wife came down about an hour and a half later. Shortly after that we went back to the room and went to bed. Our check out was the next day. We left the room at approximately 0945hrs. We met our maid on the way to the front desk. She looked at us and asked us if we were leaving and we told her yes. She told us to come back and visit her soon. The hotel called us a taxi and we waited just outside the lobby with our luggage for about 1/2 hour until the taxi arrived. On the way to the Amtrak station I realized that I didn't pack the camera and asked my wife if she remembered packing it, she said she did not. At approximately 11am we got to the Amtrak station. We pulled our luggage out of the taxi's trunk and double checked to make sure the camera didn't fall out. We then opened our suitcases to see if the camera was in any of them. We emptied them and we found NO camera. I immediately called the front desk and told them I think I left my camera in the room and asked if they could send someone up to our room to check. I gave them my cell number and they said they would call me back in 15-20 min to let us know if they find anything. We were anxiously waiting for there call for close to an hour when I decided to call them back to get an update. They said they were in the process of getting the housekeepers to check the room and they will call us back in a little bit. I waited ANOTHER 35 MIN and got no call by this time I was a little bit irriated because all of our honeymoon pictures were on the camera. I called them back and they informed me that they had to get the security department to check the room. I waited another 15 minutes and then I decided to call them and inform them to send someone up to the room we stayed in to check for the camera right now. At this time they informed me that the housekeeping and the security checked the room and found no camera. They said they would call me if they find anything. I was irate because I knew the camera was in the room on the floor next to the couch. I told them to double check that area and after a little bit of an arguement they agreed to double check the area I mentioned (so they said). They said they would keep looking for the camera and call me if they find anything. Sometime hours later while on the train I noticed that I had a message. It was the hotel and they said that they couldn't find the camera and they did all they could I CAN'T FATHOM THE FACT THAT THE CAMERA WAS IN THE ROOM AND IT HAPPENED TO GROW LEGS AND WALK AWAY. The maid seemed friendly enough but asked us 3 or 4 times during the week when our last day was. I didn't think anything of it at that time but now that the camera was last seen the night before we left makes me suspicious. When I returned to Boston a day later I called the hotel and asked if the hotel manager was around. The receptionist said I just missed him and he just stepped out for a minute. I then asked if they found a camera in the lost and found and her attitude changed once she found out it was me calling. She didn't even check she just informed me that they did everything they could and there was nothing else possible. I asked her to have the manager call me. The next day the manager of the hotel called me. He informed me that they looked everywhere for the camera and couldn't find anything. I told him that I've been doing security work for 8 years and asked them if they checked the door readers to the room to see who went in there. I also asked him to check the cameras and see if you could find anything suscpicious. I told him that if they review the cameras he should have seen me coming into the hotel from the rear door with the camera around my neck on Sunday 8/12/07 at approximately 5pm and when I left for the stores through the front lobby without the camera around my neck at approximately 7pm. He then told me that he considered this case closed as of now and there is nothing else he could do. He said he can have security look at the cameras and let us know if they find anything. It's been 1 week and 1/2 and I haven't gotten a call yet. I will be reporting this further even though I don't care too much about the 150 dollar camera.

Highly recommend.\u201d", "Author": "lisab21", "ReviewID": "UR7976885", "Content": "We just returned from a vacation in Daytona Beach, FL and we stayed at the Daytona Beach Regency. We had a great time. We were in Daytona Beach for the National Tumbling and Trampoline Competition @ the Ocean Center. One of the host hotels for the event was the Hilton, which is right across the street. Many other gym people stayed @ the Ocean Walk Resort, which is right next to the Hilton. I debated between those two hotels and read the reviews before I decided on the Daytona Beach Regency. Many of the reviews are accurate about the Ocean Walk. This property has 4000 units stacked on top of each other and there are not enough pool chairs and the elevators cannot keep up with the guests. I heard many complaints from other gym people. The Hilton is nice but it's just a room. You get so much more @ the Daytona Beach Regency. It is located right next to the Ocean Walk. It is has 11 floors and two elevators. We did not have to wait on elevators ever! It has a nice pool area. My kids loved the spiral slide into the pool. It was never soooo crowded that you couldn't find a chair. You need to wear wristbands so outsiders off the beach cannot come to your pool. Security patrolled the pool. The stairs to the beach has a gate with a combination that is given to you @ check in, again, to keep people who don't belong there out of your pool area. The outdoor hot tub was nice also. The indoor pool is small. There is also an indoor hot tub. That wasn't an issue since we spent all our time @ the outdoor pool or on the beach. The Tiki Bar is handy for drinks and food. The beach area for the Daytona Beach Regency is nice and you can walk easily down to the pier, which is just past the Hilton hotel. You can rent umbrellas from a truck that parks on the beach and sets up two lounger chairs and an umbrella. It is $25.00 per day and you keep it the whole day. He tags it with your name so no one can take it. You can also rent boogie boards and smaller folding lounge chairs from the Regency's front desk. The boogie boards were $2.00 per day or $8.00 for the week. Next door to the Regency is an old hotel that is in the process of being torn down. We heard that the property owners might make a park out of it but I find that hard to believe, it will be nice property once it's torn down. Housekeeping comes once a week if you want it. If you don\u2019t, just tell them when the knock and they will give you fresh towels or kleenex or anything you need. There is shampoo and soap in the bathroom. The rooms......they were great! It was like staying in an apartment. We had a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom. It was so worth the extra money we paid for the 2 bedroom. It was huge! We had 4 adults and 2 kids and we had plenty of room. It gave you some space since there was a TV in the living room and in each bedroom. The couch in the living room is a sofa bed. There is a full kitchen and everything you need in it. A full size fridge, stove, microwave, sink, dishwasher and kitchen table and chairs. The 2nd bedroom and bathroom can be shut off by a door. There is a mini kitchen in that room also. A small fridge and microwave with sink and stove. We did not have an ocean front, which was not a big deal. The ocean front rooms usually go to the owners. We got a call about attending a timeshare meeting. They offered to give each couple a $100 visa gift card and a 3 day/2night stay for a future stay. We went and it was on the 11th floor @ our hotel. You did not leave or go to another location anytime during the presentation. They showed you some of their remodeled penthouse apartments (which are beautiful) and gave you their whole timeshare points system spiel. It was interesting but we were not buying. We told them no and had no hassles. The presentation lasted 90 minutes and they stuck right to that timeframe. We left with gift card in hand and coupon for another stay and we have our choice between 9 different places to stay. It was worth it so if they call you to go, they are very flexible on times and days, pick one and go! No line for check in and the front desk staff was very friendly. The concierge was very nice also. They really are there to make you happy. Across the street are gift shops. There is the Starlight Diner, IHOP, Dominos, Napolis Italian food, Baskin Robins Ice Cream all close by. Papa Johns also delivers to your room. We walked to the Ocean Walk shops and there wasn't much there as far as shopping. There were restaurants and bars, ice cream and a few shops. My daughter got her hair braided in the \"square \". There was an artist painting names with pictures which was so cool. If you walk a little bit further, there are arcade games and a huge bungee ball ride. On the beach, nearby the Regency, you can buy food from a vendor and they have everything. Cheesy fries, hamburgers, etc. Just a few feet away from that you can parasail, which we did that too. There is another ride that a jet ski takes on a long tube ride. The hotel was just in a great location. It looks so small sitting next to the Ocean Walk but let me tell you, bigger isn't always better. The lobby was beautiful. Gold leather chairs, chandeliers, a big bouquet of flowers in the center. There were vending machines in the hotel which sell food, ice cream and amenities like tide and bounce, a game room with arcade games, air hockey and pool table, 2 washer and dryers on each floor to use free of charge. There was a drink lounge that you passed on your way out to the pool. There was a small fitness room also. The amenities you get with this hotel are unbeatable. We were so happy our entire stay. If you have an event @ the Ocean Walk, it is just a short walk. Lots to look @ while walking. We shared a 12 passenger van with another group from the airport and it cost us 15.00 each. (30.00 total for the ride). I hope this information is helpful if you are trying to decide on a hotel in Daytona Beach.

Our last family vacation was 10 yrs previous (also to Florida). The week we spent at the Daytona Beach Regency was so wonderful - I checked out reviews of the hotel ahead of time, and found someone so upset because of some pigeon droppings on the deck. So what! At least it's not ten inches of snow!! We won our week's stay at the hotel on Ebay. After two days of driving 700 miles, the girl at the service desk was so pleasant and nice. She was happy to meet her first person from Vermont, and had not ever experienced an air temperature cooler than 40F. Our 10 yr old daughter was stung by a jellyfish her first 20 minutes in the water - the manager was very helpful with vinegar and advice. We all spent much time in the very clean pool, and the kids all loved the waterslide! We went to a music concert just 5 minutes' walk away one evening - we met another family from the Daytona area that had five children - we now have some penpals and new friends! Even though it was a \"spring break\" week, it worked out very well for us - the college kids were out all night and we were out all day.... The cleaning lady came just often enough with clean towels, and was fun to talk to. We found our apartment to be just right for our family size, and very clean. We didn't use many kitchen dishes - we had brought some of our own - we didn't want to break anything. We all walked the beach about twice per day. The weather was perfect. The sand was beautiful except for all the jellyfish. The place felt just like our home for our week there. We even caught ourselves calling it home toward the end of our stay!", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset, England.

Some construction was on going but it wasn't a bother. Any time we had a problem the management responded quickly. We had easy beach access. There was a pool with a slide my kids enjoyed and lots of activities during the week including live bands. The resort seemed more geared towards adults and older groups than families.

Second the elevators seem to be over worked and not well coordinated, long waits and full cars when it arrived were a frequent problem.

We stipulated that we wanted ocean view, upper floor and a non-smoking room. I explained that we had a family member with asthma. The hotel rep. said those requests would be honored. The night we checked in, we were given a room on the 2nd floor. The room and the entire floor stunk of cigarette smoke. The room's balcony was up against the roof level of the parking garage. The garage roof was 3-4 feet higher than the balcony floor. Our view was of nothing but flat roof, and the balcony was enclosed, floor to ceiling, with steel bars, just like a jail cell! I immediately went down to the front desk and demanded the room we were promised. When I described the \"hole\" of a room we had been given, the desk clerk smirked and agreed to look for another room. I asked why we didn't get what we were promised. She said the good rooms go to the people who check in earliest during the day, and how early you reserve or what you are promised doesn't mean anything. I said I would pay extra to get the oceanfront room. She said there were none available. She gave us a different room. It was on the 5th floor, didn't smell of smoke, but had a view of the alley, a dumpster and the neighboring hotel's parking garage. The balcony was a nesting spot for pigeons and was covered with droppings. The room and windows were filthy. Two of the beds had no sheets on them, not enough pillows and missing blankets. The entire suite was smelly and musty, but we couldn't open the doors to the balcony, because their were no screens and the pigeons kept trying to walk inside! The door from the master bedroom to the balcony wouldn't latch, so they had a chain on the door. It would open an inch then slam as it swung back and forth in the wind. We stuck a shoe in the crack to stop the slamming and had to listen to the wind whistle all night long. As a side note, as I was leaving the front desk, after demanding a better room, a man walked in off the street and requested a 2 bedroom suite. The next day I saw him in the elevator and he remarked about his nice oceanfront view! We were only staying 3 nights and were busy with the wedding so decided not to fight another round with the front desk. When we checked out, the clerk tried to charge us $300.00 more than we owed, and had no record of our prepaid first night! Without a doubt this was the WORST hotel stay I've had in my life. The accommodations were disgusting and the hotel management was pitiful.

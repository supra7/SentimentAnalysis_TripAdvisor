I went to Chicago for a conference and because of its central location and affordable price, we decided to stay here. It is located next to the river in downtown Chicago, within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The view of the rooms are good, too. HOWEVER, I must say this hotel is really really poorly designed. When you walk into the room you'll see the bed right next to the door which means you WILL hear people talk in the hall way. You can also hear people next door talking on the phone and can hear pretty much every single word they are saying. The closet is literally tiny and can fit maybe 3 hangers. The closet door is a mirror which is nice, but there is no light in front of it!!! Be prepared to look at yourself in the mirror in the dark... The bathroom is also very poorly designed - the toilet paper is located in the back of and far away from the toilet, which means you'd have to really try to reach for it! There is also a weird magnifying mirror hanging right in front of the bathroom mirror and it is quite annoying. There is air conditioning in the room, but it doesn't tell you the temperature of the room. All there is is a button says \"lo-high\" \"warm- cold\" and you have to guess where you want it to be. The hotel is nice to provide free internet, but the desk is barely useable because there is no electric outlet to plug in your desktop or cell phone or anything else... I had to charge my phone in the bathroom. When you walk into the room you won't be able to turn on the light because there are no lights in the room, except for 1 desk lamp and 1 floor lamp both located on the other side of the room... so be prepared to walk in the dark across the room to find a light and locate the switch. I am really not a picky person when it comes to hotels and usually am very understanding, but it is just all the small stuff that adds up giving me the impression that this hotel is super poorly designed. They might have tried very hard but really didn't meet customer needs. Sure the location is great and the beds are comfortable, but look how many hotels are around this areas! Location is definitely not their \"unique\" quality so nobody should say that they recommend this hotel because of the location. Most hotels around here also have great customer service so that is not a winner, either. Like I said before, it is the small things that make a difference, and it is too bad that they failed.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable and clean.\u201d", "Author": "Roadhemi", "ReviewID": "UR126358287", "Content": "Stayed for 6 nights and I slept very well.

There was also a nice bottle of Merlot waiting for us in the room when we entered. As for service, housekeeping and room service was always spot on with our requests and the concierge was very good with his recommendations for dinner and brunch, didn't try to push the restaurant on premises, to us. The location is pretty much the best in Chicago downtown - stone's throw from the Magnificent Mile, facing the River and less than half a mile away from the best restaurants, nightlife and attractions in town. Even though I live in a suburb of Chicago and stayed here for the weekend, I think it was completely worth it, and more. Not to mention, they extended our check out by a couple of hours.

Let me start by saying that my boyfriend is a huge Batman (especially the new Christian Bale movies) fan and I knew the Dark Knight was filmed in Chicago. So I researched filming locations, and ended up learning that Bruce Wayne's penthouse in the movie is the penthouse of Hotel 71. After reading more about the hotel, it seemed to also be a great choice in terms of location and value. I originally booked a Deluxe River King View room but when we arrived, the concierge asked if we wanted to upgrade to a Premier River King View (where we would be on the high floors) for $80 more. I'm a sucker for a good view, so I agreed and we upgraded. I'm glad we did because there can't be a more perfect view of Chicago's downtown. The only thing I have to say is the room still was very small, which I thought was weird because we upgraded to one of the most expensive rooms besides the penthouse. But we were in Chicago to sight-see so we didn't plan on spending too much time in the room anyway. Everyone at the hotel was very nice and accommodating. I asked concierge if it would be possible for us to go up to the penthouse floor because my boyfriend was such a fan of the movie. He set something up for us later in the day when hotel security was available to escort us upstairs for a brief tour. Out of everything I planned for the few days, I think that was my boyfriend's favorite part of the trip and I am very thankful to the hotel staff for making that happen for us. Overall, the hotel is in a great location, has great views of Chicago, and a very friendly, accommodating staff at a reasonable price.

I can't tell you what it runs compared to a normal downtown Chicago breakfast, but I was a bit shocked I was spending $27 on the buffet. That being said, the food was excellent! The scrambled eggs, potatos and sausage links are probably the best I've ever had. No kidding either and I'm a big food guy.

This was our first trip since it has changed to Hotel 71 and we were not disappointed. Upon check-in, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to one of their newly remodeled rooms, which we did for $20/night. We ended up on the 17th floor with an incredible river view (also a small upgrade when I originally made our reservation). The front desk staff was very helpful and check-in and check-out were both very quick. Rooms are a nice size with modern decor. Ours had an interesting little area (size of a walk-in closet) behind the tv wall with a dresser-type console and a Keurig coffee maker. I'm a Keurig fan, so this was a big hit with me. Our supply of 4 K-cups was replenished daily. We also ended up storing our luggage back here as it was more accessible than in the regular closet. Our bathroom was amazing, and I think the best part from spending the extra money for an upgrade. Large bathroom but only one vanity (two would have been nice) but the large, walk-in shower with its rain showerhead and bench were amazing. I ended up taking a shower every morning and evening just to enjoy the incredible shower. We also liked the Tarocco toiletries so much we've located them online and plan to order some for home use. I had a little trouble adjusting the thermostat to our liking, especially since we like our room cool for sleeping. As I tried but couldn't open the windows, I ended up having to turn it way down, which ended up working fine. Nothing wrong with the heat in this place, which is probably a good thing for those cold Chicago winters! Although we didn't use it, the business area behind the lobby was very nice with a few computers for internet access and some complimentary newspapers. Great location - two blocks from the State and Lake subway stop. Close to State Street shopping and the famous Chicago Theatre as well as all of that incredible Michigan Avenue shopping. It might be a little further from some of the Michigan Avenue shops, but the proximity to the subway and State Street, as well as the lack of street noise more than made up for it. Also, closer to Millennium Park (bean sculpture) and the Art Institute. We ate at a variety of restaurants within a few block radius, including Gold Coast Dogs, Elephant & Castle and the Billy Goat Tavern (chee-burger, chee-burger!).

Couple that with a 20% discount for pre-paying and it was a pretty good deal. Posh interior, working elevators with low wait times and generally really nice looking. The suite had a wet bar and fridge, very nice lounge/desk area, huge sleeping area with chaise lounge and a phenomenal bathroom. Garden tub + seperate shower with rain head - LOVED it. Hotel 71 is close to EVERYTHING. Seriously, the best location. The river is across the street, the Tribune building just to the right and fantastic architecture all around. Nice little restaurant/bar extended off the lobby and an array of food/drink choices all around. The staff was super friendly and my room was fantastic. I will say I can see how others reviewers may be irritated with the thermostat - I had it set on cool for the most part but I'm pretty sure it stayed the same temperature the entire time. It was comfortable for me, but I can how others might find it a bit stuffy. The business center was a little on the small side, but had everything I needed and everything worked.

I intended on getting my brother and sister to join me on the trip - but they never got their act together. So I ended up traveling solo. I usually ( because of just pure laziness and the prospect of accumulating points) stay with Marriott, but I decided to take a leap of faith and try out this boutique-type hotel that offered river views. So very glad I did. .\\ First -the view was excellent. Nice large windows to enjoy the view from. The Hotel is situated somewhat perpendicular to the river; So from your river view room you Look down the river as it opens out on the lake gives you such a unique feel to Chicago. Especially at sunrise and sunset. The way the light plays along the streets, river makes it seem as if Chicago has laid a golden carpet out you and only you....and that the city is yours for the taking. I think this is by far this Hotels top selling point. The service was excellent. I booked my room through the hotels website- because they had a special running at the time. I got a Deluxe room ( with two queen beds and river view) for 227/ night during the last week in August. The room was Clean, appeared freshly renovated, more spacious than I expected. I think the catch was that it was a Physically impaired (disabled) -accessible room... but dont let that fool you. You could hardly notice the modifications. Contemporary styling keeps the bars looking as if they are just part of the decor and I did not note this until I was checking out. Of course you cant beat the location. Took one train from midway to the State/Lake station ( 45min ride one way) and had 5 min easy walk to the hotel. Another 5-10 min walk from the hotels steps and I was in a millineum park enjoying a sandwhich and perrier listening to jazz floating through the air from the free summer concert series. Ahh heaven. Loved this hotel so much that when I had to return to Chicago 1 month later. I tried to book it outright and didnt even bother searching for an internet deal...But they were full !!! The horror! No worries though, investigated the closest hotel that offered the same location and thus the same views...... and found the River Hotel next door with slightly cheaper rates- However, in comparison, River Hotel had much smaller rooms and they were missing the nice decor, no friendly doorman, had to wait in a line at the checkout counter. *sigh* Yes, I had been spoiled by Hotel 71 and I probably looked like a jealous lover as rolled my carryon luggage past that day with a huff. But let that speak to Hotel 71's quality and value, not truly anything against River Hotel. Would return to hotel 71 in a heartbeat....

We had a superior king room with the river view. The good: very spacious room, beautiful view, double vanities, lots of countertop surface to set things, comfortable bed. The bad: paper thin walls and tiled entry into room made noises throughout seem very loud and it was difficult to get a good night sleep. Couple this with hammering and the constant sawing from a chop saw for two mornings in a row across from our room made the beginning of what was suppose to be relaxing weekend away from construction noise (my husband and I both work in the construction field) not so relaxing. The jack hammering as we waited for the elevator in the lobby and other various noises from the room above ours we thought finally warranted a call to the front desk. 1000 spent at this hotel on room and parking. I never did get to awaken a single morning there peacefully. And how did they offer to make this right? A free breakfast on Sunday. Sunday, I couldn't wait leave. I really wanted to like this place and write more about some of nice features. However, the lack of sleep has proven me grumpy and very disappointed.

The room was very clean and had a coffee maker. No fridge, microwave or safe. The only real negative- and it's quite bad- is that the doors slam VERY loudly. The walls are somewhat thin and you can hear every thing in the halls. The cleaning staff often talked back and forth at early hours which kept me awake. After the first night, I kept the fan running and white noise on the radio so that I could sleep. The staff was friendly and very helpful. On the last day, they were closing the hotel for maintenance and couldn't store our luggage. They helped us by taking it next door to the Club Quarters. The door man gave me suggestions for the cheapest drinks and gave me a coupon for free apps at a nearby restaurant. (By the way, for cheaper drinks and breakfast, go to the Emerald across the street!) They also had one of the nicest workout rooms I've seen in the city, with two rooms of Life Fitness machines, free weights, mats, etc. The room had wall a/c units which kept the temperature low when the sun was streaming through the windows.

I wish I would be writing a very nice review about this property but unfortunately I am not. The first look when you walk-in to the hotel very impressive: they have nice looking restaurant \"Hoyt's Tavern\" and nice decorated lobby. Check-in not informative but quick (I noticed this in lots of Chicago hotels not only this one). We were offered a map of the area at the check-in and just later I realized why that was a good gesture - you will want to run out from property when you see your room ... trust me that's how I felt. Nice elevators but when the door opens to your floor - new world opens to you. We stayed on the 36th floor. It was a corner room. The view was spectacular and that's all about what was nice. Carpet in hallway was stained, door to the room was opening very hard and made a loud noise. Room was very dirty: dust on night stands, finger marks on the desk, stained carpet, the chair had white stains, the bedskirt was so dirty that I could not believe what I was seeing. The bathroom was the most outdated bathroom I have ever seen: old tub, grout pinkish, vents very dusty, mirror dirty. If we would of known that what we were seeing online is not matching the reality, we would of never booked. I saw lots of other people's pictures of the rooms and they do not look anything like we had and it was listed as Deluxe River View Room. Maybe we ended up in the section that was not renovated or something like that. This could be an excuse for outdating but I can not find an excuse for dirtiness everywhere. Commenting other postings: Yes, the room doesn't have refrigerator. We slept good because the hotel was empty and no one was making any noise. The staff in The Hoyt's Tavern careless and rude, especially the manager on the night duty on Monday night. He was more involved in flirting and hugging his bartender then caring about his job. We booked \"Rise and Dine\" package. No one even mentioned this to us at the check-in. Later we stopped by the FD to figure out how that all works with the breakfast, do we need any vouchers for the restaurant and were told just let them know about it and they will give you separate menu to choose from. When we got to the restaurant server did not know anything about the package and said we should of got vouchers. She suggested to charge to the room and discuss about it with the front desk staff. Front desk staff was nice but that's all about. Very disappointed in overall experience and would never go back. I work in hotel business and know better then anyone else that things happen (and that is the reason why I did not made a fit about it) but I know too if you care and you motivate your staff to strive for customer service you would at least ask at the check-out how was your stay. This place definitely needs improvement in management that cares about what they do and property needs serious renovation.

Flavors, however, are a different subject altogether. My medium rare cheeseburger was so dry and the sliders I had the following day were just awful.

But the Amalfi seemed to be just a notch above in several areas, which left me wondering why I was paying more money. From reading some of the other Trip Advisor reviews it is likely that I was simply in the yet-to-be-refurbished section of the hotel, but then again, why the higher price? To break it down, Hotel 71 had much nicer views from the windows, and I guess if that is important to you, you should pick this hotel.

The lobby and onsite restaurant (Hoyt) had great modern and comfortable furniture. The room itself had a marvalous view from the 32nd floor. Bed was super comfy, as was the chaise lounge. Like other reviewers said, the walls are a little thin and the bathroom could use some updating (mainly the tub as it was VERY slow to drain after showering), but these things didn't bother me too much to ruin my stay. The staff responded quickly to my request for more towels and I loved having a Keurig in the room. Unfortunately, we had a very busy weekend, so we didn't spend a lot of time there. But I'd love to go back, especially at that price. Few tips: The attached garage is $45/night. But you can park at the open lot right next to the hotel for about $28/night. We parked our car and walked or took the bus wherever we needed to go, and cabbed it when it got too late. But the location is optimal, great for those who want to shop/dine/play on Mag. Mile and come back to their room to rest and/or refuel. Also great locale to reach the parks for the Taste of Chicago or other events. Wish they had a pool, but oh well..the beaches in Chicago are a great substitute. The restaurant at the hotel next door Bacino's also makes a decent deep dish pizza.

The on premise restaurant, Hoyt's, was busy and seemed popular with a younger crowd. They have comfortable outdoor seating that looked inviting but we didn't get a chance to enjoy it.

When we arrived? Again, amazing. The young lady at the service desk bent over backwards to make our check-in painless and enjoyable. Ok, on to the hotel. I booked a lower-level city view room (they were on sale at the time). This was my wife and I's 20th anniversary and I was a bit nervous that we would get a less-than-adaquate room because of the price. What did we get? A room on the 27th floor with a view of the river. They had already upgraded our room, without our requesting, which is very cool. The views from the room are amazing. When we left for dinner, I was approached by two different employees asking if we needed assistance in hailing a cab. Since we were going to the House of Blues, which is only about two blocks away, there was no point in getting a cab but their attentiveness was amazing. When we returned to the hotel? The staff greated us and asked how our night went and then asked if we need anything. I have never, in my life, experienced better customer service from a hotel than I did this weekend. I know how people tend to write lengthy reviews on this site. I know that I get bored reading them after a certain point. I will finish by saying this.... You WILL NOT be disappointed if you stay here. From the customer service, which is AMAZING, to the location, which is also AMAZING, you will not be disappointed. And another cool fact? You are staying across the river from the Trump Towers. They cost $395 per night. I paid $89. I got the same views with probably the same level of customer service.

We are EXTREMELY picky about the hotel we stay in (especially with the recent bedbug outbreaks). After much research we decided on this hotel. I was really impressed with the room. We booked a city view (cheaper than a river view, but we got a river view anyway). They gave us a beautiful room on the 27th floor which happened to be a corner room....2 walls FULL of windows. One wall gave us the \"city view\" which was of some beautiful architectural buildings (my bf is a photographer and went nuts taking pictures of the building elements from our windows) and the other wall gave us a view of the river and some more buildings. Really nice view! The room was clean and big enough (not huge, but you don't need a room any bigger for 2 people). The bathroom was also clean and attractive. This place is a GREAT location as well. All main attractions are a 30 minute walk, or a $5 cab ride. We arrived by train and it cost about $5 to get to our hotel by cab. We also cabbed it to the Aquarium & Natural History museum, and Navy Pier...both $5. We walked to Millennium Park and Hancock Tower (5 min and 30 min walks), and it is right at the south end of the Magnificent Mile. The staff at the front desk were EXTREMELY polite and cheerful at all times! The only complaints I have are the following: - The room was extremely cold. There is a thermostat that you can control your room temperature but I didn't figure it out until the next day. We left a $5 tip with a little note for the housekeeper asking for an extra blanket. When we came back, the money was GONE, but NO BLANKET! We called down to the front desk explaining the situation, and we had to call 2X (45 minutes apart), wait another 30 minutes, then go down to the front desk and ask for the blanket AGAIN. VERY frustrating. - Not only did the housekeeper take our money without providing that little extra step of giving us an extra blanket, but they left garbage (including our note that we had written our request on) all over the floor in the room foyer. The next day, there was a HUGE wet spot in our room foyer that I ended up stepping in and hand to change my socks. - last complaint about housekeeping...they took FOREVER to clean our rooms! Even with the sign on the door requesting service, we would come back around 4 pm, and the room still wouldn't be cleaned. SO frustrating because we'd have to leave again because we didn't want to be there when they were cleaning the room.

I had a great experience this past weekend. From check-in to check-out, I never felt out of place or unwelcome. Ryan assisted us with our check-in. I had requested in the reservation (done directly off of their website\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you can save 25% if you book 14 days or more in advance!) to be able to get into our room early, and it was honored. We arrived a little before 1PM. Ryan was helpful, courteous and attentive. He asked us what brought us to Chicago, if we had ever stayed with them before and if we needed a map of the area. We took a map (a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Concierge Preferred\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd map) of downtown Chicago. It listed points of interest, other hotels, recommended dining establishments and more. We took the elevator up to our room on the sixteenth floor. I noticed a lot of complaints on TripAdvisor regarding the wait for the elevator, but we never had to wait more than thirty seconds. They had two banks of elevators, with two elevators per bank. One bank was for rooms on floors up through twenty-three, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming the other bank was for the higher rooms. Our room was great. A beautiful view of the Chicago River, its bridges, Wacker Drive, Trump Tower, etc., was what we had when we looked out the window. It looked even better at night. We had a Premier River View room with two queen beds. The bathroom was a very good size. In one part, there were two separate wash basins with a vanity at each, and in the other part, a good-size soaking tub and a large, glass-door shower with a rainfall shower head and a built-in seat. The water pressure was a little on the light side, but I have no complaints. No bathrobes, but the towels were plentiful! I guess you get the bathrobes if you book a suite. The beds were very comfortable. There was a DVD player in the room as well as hi-speed wi-fi, and both were free of charge! Had no problem with the DVD player and no problem connecting to the internet. There was an LG HDTV which provided a great picture. Our section of the floor didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too many people on it. There was a group of girls across the hall that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to shut up, but they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there too often. So, the walls are a little thin, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal. The closet was a good size, and it had a safe. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t located in the bathroom as some other reviewers have said, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming they had a different type of room than we did. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order room service or go to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diner, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for those\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the room service menu looked good, though, and the prices were fair. There was no pool in the hotel, so if that is a must for you and your travel companions, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to look elsewhere. But, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to swim!

We saved 15% on our stay and also got a $25 food/beverage credit. I typically stay in very nice hotels, (I.E., The Wynn, Westin in Maui) etc, and willing to pay big bucks for a nice hotel. I will offer some advice to the hotel as you will see, which is why I like to be realistic about my opinions. This hotel is slightly high in price, then again, its in Chicago so they can get away with it. You will read a lot about location. I have never been to Chicago before, and quite frankly, yes this hotel is by far the best in location. Upon arrival you will not find a door man or a bell hop. You will find a cart outside for your luggage which is nice, maybe the bell hop was busy or something but I never saw them helping anyone with their luggage. - Don't claim to be an elite hotel if your service isn't going to match what you claim you are. There was a man who stood in the lobby and near the door, but not once did they get the door for me, my wife or any other guest. If you are doorman, then been a doorman, not a Wal Mart greeter. Check in went very smooth, except they \"try\" to be overly friendly. I appreciate their effort, but its fake, soft voices, please and thanks after everything - it was just annoying. Instead, be genuine and polite...don't try so hard, it actually destroyed what you want to accomplish. Room was very clean and updated. Despite what you will read on here about the tubs, our tub was brand new. The bathrooms are wonderful. Its an older building so the A/C isn't the best, especially in the bathrooms. The hallways were muggy and hot. There is an electronic safe, microwave, refrigerator and even a wine/bottle refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee selections. No cream or sugar though, you'll need to call room service for that. There is a flat screen & a stereo that plays CD's. You can't listen to the radio because it doesn't have an antenna, and I don't know who brings CD's with them anymore, so its pretty useless, it doesn't even have an IPOD hook up. The windows will open slightly, which is nice to bring in the fresh air and street noises. Rooms have free Wi-Fi, and the closet space is very nice. A nice halogen recessed light turns on when you open these french doors. Overall, the room was very eligant and very up to date. The beds...oh boy. This gets the lowest mark possible. They cheaped out on the linens big time. The bed is comfortable, but the sheets are nothing special. They're not crisp. Pillows are nothing more then soft cardboard with a cover. Westin by far hands down has the best linens and pillows. For the price I paid, I expected a little more then motel sheets & pillows. We ordered up breakfast one morning, and it was fabulous! Wow. Very good, very high class and fancy, well worth every dollar spent, and the best part is I was full for most of the day after the breakfast. I'm always reading comments about how everyone loves the \"rain\" type shower heads. Personally, I hate them. I don't need a pressure washer for a shower, but something with a little more juice behind it then a trickle effect would be nice. For the size of the shower, they could have installed multiple heads. His/Her sinks is very nice, and they are on opposite walls which even makes it better. Only down fall is that the door opens up in front of one of the sinks, so you have to enter the bathroom first then close the door. Its already hot and steamy in there and closing the door doesn't help it. The heating/cooling doesn't seem to work very well in the bathrooms, probably because its an older building per se. A pocket door would have been ideal. Speaking of doors, the door into your room, yes it looks nice, but doesn't provide any protection from noises in the hallway. I could hear conversations inside other rooms simply by standing in the hallway. There were some people talking when they returned at 4am which I awoke too, so an insulated door would have been the way to go. The down falls is there is no pool. The hotel bar sucks. You feel like you're at a wedding reception/cash bar. There is no hospitality room, oh, and get this, the conceirge or front desk have very little recomendations or knowledge of Chicago. They will only know the resturants that are around the corner. I expected more expertise and knowledge. They knew very little about things like the double decker trolly tour, etc. It wasn't just one person that I asked either...try 4....and none of them knew much about anything. Big turn off here. Again, don't claim to be elegant if your not going to back it up with your staff.

Kinda creepy in a way, but nice. They were helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions. Had a \"deluxe\" room which is probably standard. Room was huge! Nice bonus, but it was a little dated and in need of a reno, wrt to furniture and older TV which did not have the best picture. Beds were decent. WiFi very spotty and slow. Had the a/c cranked and it was only cool, but it was mid-90's outside. Bathroom most dated though. Liveable, but tub was chipped and faded, found hair in it, and in toilet too. In hindsight, should've paid the extra $40/night for premier room which look renovated on the website. Hallways dim as well with worn walls and old carpet. Also noisy at times. Got the AAA rate ($200/night) for a river view, but check you're bill. We had to correct it. Other hotels offering same view were at least $75/night more. There were fireworks one night because they were filming a Ron Howard/Vince Vaughn movie. Wrt location...it was easy to get to from MDW via the Orange line and a short walk. Corner Bakery literally next door for breakfast, which is important because there is only a litle cafe in the lobby. You're right at the base of Magnificent Mile so go north for shopping, Hancock, Navy Pier, etc. If you go south on Michigan Ave, the Art Institute is only about 10 min away, while the Shedd and Field Museum is about 30 min away on foot. Btw, the dock for the Architectural Cruise by the CAF is there too. Warning...get tickets early because almost all times were sold out. You can go on Ticketmaster but there is a service fee.

Then we had to wait for the front desk to 'figure' out how their schedules were going to work and who was going to check in who prior to checking in - again horrible service.

The bathroom was clean, shower was good with plenty of pressure. In room coffee was tasty, and the desk and wifi were a nice touch. The view of the river was great! As an added bonus, the windows open, so a little fresh air was a welcome thing, as the room did have the odor of smoke. (Hotel was full due to conventions in town. I was not able to get a non-smoking room) Overall the room was nice, however I do believe it had not been refurbished in a while. There was shoddy repair work from the removal of the in bathroom hairdryer, and some wallpaper was peeling. Once again, minor issues, but hopefully that will be rectified soon. Elevators were swift, and the doormen and front desk staff were very friendly, quick with several recommendations, and very attentive to any extra needs. It will be better when the full restaurant is back opened, instead of the bar area being only option. The Hotel 71 does get kudos for a good breakfast selection for grab and go! The modern design of the hotel is a nice break from the chains, and I found the lobby area inviting and comfortable. It was a good area to sit and read the paper, and watch the comings and goings as I waited for other members of my party.

This place had great reviews across the board so we tried it out. Unfortunately - that's the best part of this review. I called to make a reservation over the phone b/c i found a package online for a weekend away - where you get two nights with some other stuff included and 30% off one of the nights. I called b/c I wanted to be SURE that's the way the offer was. The girl assured me it was and proceeded to book me. However, once i got my email confirmation, she booked me on the wrong day. The cost was cheaper on that weekend but it was the wrong weekend. The reason i caught the incorrect booking is because they charged my credit card for a late fee since the weekend was in the past! Um HELLO! I tried to call and change the reservation and find out why they had charged my card and was put on hold for 15 minutes. I was pissed and hung up. Had my boyfriend call back b/c i would have been mean to them and he's way nice on the phone. He called up to change the reservation and they didn't apologize but booked it on the correct weekend. The price had gone up as well! We were leaving in two days so we decided to deal with it in person once we got to the hotel. When we arrived - the lobby was pretty cool but once we got to our room, it was nice but it certainly wasn't worth the price we paid for it. There was a HUGE crack in the tub and everything looked a bit rundown. No so happy about that. Once we were leaving and going to pay - the price was different than what i was quoted a few different times. It was different from the second email confirmation i received as well. Also, i we hadn't be charged for the 30% off the second night that i had SPECIFICALLY asked about over the phone. I asked the guy at the front desk who wasn't so hot to help me out either. Come on dude! I bet you were the one who put me on hold for 15 minutes! at least take my number down and call me back. I've worked in a serious industry and this is not the way to treat a customer. After questioning the bill again he brought up the offer online and proceeded to tell me that it was 30% off a second ROOM not a night. so freaking confusing. I was pissed but whatever.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is an excellent location and to go to any of the sightseeing activities was an $8 cab ride at the most. We went to pretty much every tourist attraction during our trip and I dont want to write too much on here about which are worth it and which ones aren't but definitely go on the River and Lake Boat Tour(90 mins), its right across the street and it was fantastic. There are several companies to choose from but we went on the Wendella for the night ride($23/person), its worth it. Overall I don't have one bad thing to say about this hotel, except maybe that if you have a car its a bit expensive for parking($43/night) so we did what another reviewer recommended, and parked in the Millennium Park Garage($24/night) about 3 blocks away.

We had zero trouble with the elevators and they came quickly every time. Located at Michigan/Wacker the hotel is two blocks from every train line and many major bus routes. In my opinion, I couldn't have chosen a better hotel, but that said, some travelers may not like a few things. This is not the hotel if you like a lavish restaurant, lobby, and having your hand-held by a concierge. There is an excellent Corner Bakery Cafe next door for breakfast, but only a tiny hotel restaurant. The staff is efficient and mostly invisible (my favorite), but if you want to be greeted a lot . . .you won't be. Perhaps most importantly, you really should request a room away from the elevators, they are older and creaky and you will hear them if your room is close by. Ice is not on every floor, but is easy and generous (extra buckets are stored by the machine). There may be some street noise, but you are in the absolute heart of an enormous city and should expect it. . . bring earplugs.

We wanted a good location, a comfortable room, and that was about it. We found a great deal at Hotel 71 through Easyclicktravel.com and found that the TripAdvisor reviews we'd read about the hotel were fairly accurate. We checked in late on a Friday night due to a delayed flight. The man working the reception desk seemed a little spacey and first gave us a key to an occupied room--we went up there with our luggage and opened the door to find it chained and the TV on inside! We went back to the front desk to request a second room--this time we got a smoking room after we had requested nonsmoking. Finally, the 3rd room they gave us fit the bill. The chaos upon check-in is the one true complaint I have about Hotel 71. The room was clean and comfortable and a great deal for the price we paid. The tub in the bathroom did drain a bit slowly, but not enough to bother us. The staff were all kind and attentive and the location truly can't be beat. I think my husband summed it up best by saying that the Hotel 71 is a hotel that probably used to be really great, but has languished a bit over the years and could use a little TLC. For the price we paid, though (about $115 a night), we felt we got a great deal of value for our money.

Still, the staff is very friendly, safes are available in the reception office and the rooms are clean, have TV, stereo, a clean bathroom. Another plus: Free Wi-Fi in the room. Rooms appaer a bit dark as they have dark rugs and furniture. We recommend the Corner Bakery next door for meals. We would stay again for location but not really because the hotel is so great.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cStaff nice, but could use some touch-up repairs.\u201d", "Author": "mrscfuller", "ReviewID": "UR34250929", "Content": "I have traveled to Chicago on many occasions. I decided to stay at a different area closer to Michigan Av. I chose Hotel 71. The staff was very nice. The out side and the hotel lobby was okay. But once I got to our room, i was kind of disappointed. the hotel room was not as nice as the picture that they showed. The room itself was clean but it was the little details that where not right. For instance, the tub and shower needed some work the shower handles and knobs where loose and out of place. The tub looked like it had been painted and the paint was wearing off. The old staines where coming through. Also when i wen to turn down the bed, there was no fitted mattress sheets on the bed they just took a regular sheet and covered the mattress with it. After the first night we got up early that morning and went out for the day . We did not return until about four o'clock that evening and our room had not yet been cleaned .

I also requested a connecting/adjoining room and we got that with no problems. We were also given an early check-in and upgraded to river view rooms when I only booked a city view room. The views from all of our windows was AWESOME! It was also nice that they opened. The location of this hotel was very nice also. It's about a 1 1/2blks from MI Ave. We also went to the The Roof which is a lounge bar at the Wit Hotel. It was walking distance. Some other bars that we went to, we had to take a cab but it was no more than $8 or so. As some other people mention it is also right around the corner from The Corner Bakery which has very good breakfast, but get there early cause it gets crowded (we went around 10a) My only complaint were the elevators. I had read about that in some of the reviews listed but I also read that the problem had been fixed...I couldn't tell.

You can tell from the bathtub and the wallpaper that it's not a new hotel, but the rooms are really big and very nice. Staff is ok although not over-friendly. There's no restaurant at all, they have roomservice and a very good corner bakery cafe right next to the hotel, very convenient for breakfast.

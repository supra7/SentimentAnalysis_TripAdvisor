We had a wonderful lady at the front desk who said our room wasn't ready but she would make sure we had a nice corner room when we got back, and we did! When we got back abound 5p.m., the place was busy. So we stood in line behind a man. When he was finished checking in, the lady didn't even acknowledge us and walked away. So I waited, and waited until finally I asked another worker and she said, \"that post is closed.\" At least she could have told me! So rude. Anyways, after waiting about 30 minutes to get our room we were told that the bar/restaraunt was closed for renovations. This process was very disappointing. However, our room was nice and big, great view, and nice bath products.

The person that was arranging the travel found this hotel instead. I looked it up online and found this web site and its reviews. I was incredibly scared. Other than the lobby size (which matters little to me. I don't plan on staying in hotel lobbies, I prefer rooms) I saw so many reviews calling this a deplorable hotel with horrific rooms, hallways, and awful service. We couldn't find another hotel at a reasonable rate that was in Manhattan at that late notice. I would have had to go to an outside suburb. I dreaded my stay all the way to the city and to the hotel itself. I was happily wrong about my apprehensions. Again, the lobby was small, but very clean. The staff was pleasant and extremely helpful (there was a problem with the payment, the person at the office didn't send back an authorization slip by mistake. Even though it was difficult and tedious to fix this as it was around closing time for our office, the desk staff essentially bent over backwards to get the slipup fixed. I'm guessing the hallways that other past guests remarked about weren't on my floor as there was no odor and, again, very clean. When I entered my room, I was blown away. First, you enter into a corridor that goes by a normal sized closet with a safe in it, ending at a small kitchen with fridge, sink, cabinet and nice counter. Then I turned the corner into the room itself.... The initial portion of the room is a sitting area (for lack of a more appropriate term) that holds two nice chairs, a love seat, desk, coffee table, TV, and end tables. Very nice place to relax after a day at the conference. The actual bed area was pleasant size with a walk in closet that far exceeds closets at most hotels. The bathroom was a little small, but still well maintained and just what was needed for what you normally do in a bathroom. The shower on the other hand was exquisite with incredible pressure and constant hot water (something often missing at most hotels I've been at, including \"finer\" ones). The continental breakfast was very good (I only partook one morning as the conference had breakfast each day), but as said, the lobby was small, so you had to take the food and go. The only, minimal drawback was the view out of the window. It was of the back alley and of course not that pleasant, but I had no intention of site seeing out my window, but rather by going out on the town, which was quite easy as the nearest subway was 3 blocks and the next was about 5 at Grand Central Station.

And again, like most of you I find that there are good and bad points as well as reviewers who are open minded and those that are fussy about the little things. For those readers that are fussy and picky then please stop here; don't stay at this hotel. Go and book into one of the hotel chains and pay twice the rate. At least you'll have reason to demand the quality that you deserve. This is my sixth visit to NY and I have stayed in different hotels each time; from the outrageously expensive down to the real cheap and cheerful. The Helmsley Middletowne I rate as upper middle in my quality range based on price, location and room standards. My family and I have just returned from four nights over the marathon week end and having booked two rooms was a little apprehensive about them not being on the same floor. I needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have worried as the staff were very accommodating and understood our needs. In fact all the staff were very helpful and polite. We booked two king bedded, non smoking rooms and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we got. Yes, the rooms are a little tired in places but they were clean. A few carpet marks but nothing that was worth complaining about. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in the Marriott and they had carpet stains! So, to put into perspective this hotel is very good value for money. Its location, East 48th between 3rd and Lexington Ave is ideal for walking to the Rockefeller Centre (10mins), Times Sq (15mins), and Central Station (5mins). I think in my experience probably the best location of all the hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at. The hotel offers buffet breakfast which you have to get from the lobby, true that you have to get up early to get the best choice but personally we preferred the Traditional Comfort Diner (East 45th St between 2nd and 3rd Ave) and Toasties (East 48th just before 5th Ave). On one evening my daughter and her friend ate in while my wife and I went out for dinner. The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cater but offers a selection of menus from local restaurants that deliver direct to your room. They ordered pasta and were pleased with the quality and price. New York has lots to offer, something for everyone so I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend things as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down to personal choice.

The room appeared on the surface to be relatively clean; however, when you really examined areas, you could see major dust.

Browsing for hotels we found universal complaints about the size of NYC rooms, but noticed that it cost just marginally more than the average NYC rates to upgrade to a suite at this hotel. The suite we ended up with was 650 square feet, with a huge living room, two LCD TVs, a walk-in closet and a kitchenette (no coffeemaker or range, but fridge and sink.) After a day in the crush of the city, it was calming to return to the comfort of an apartment instead of a bed/chair/bathroom setup. I couldn't help but think of all the hotel reviews that read \"what a beautiful room, but I had to turn sideways to move past the bed.\" You could throw a discus in this suite. The rooms do need a facelift. The trim has been painted so many times over the decades that it's losing its profile, and repairs over the decades have been done in an ad hoc fashion. E.g. a patch of white bathroom tiles on a floor of tan tiles, a brown light switch with an ivory face plate on one wall, then a white Decora light switch on the next, that sort of thing. The carpet had seen better days, and the freezer in the mini-fridge had lost its door. Not a hotel for the detail-obsessed. Nonetheless, the room was very comfortable, quiet, and clean (except for high spots) and the staff were responsive to our only complaints -- we were moved after one night from a double bed suite to the king we had booked, and a slow-draining tub was quickly fixed. Front desk staff were fairly good, though one out of the four we dealt with seemed completely indifferent. Breakfast was busy but not a big problem, just take the drink tray from your room and stack up your croissants, bagels, coffee, and (maybe) juice. The NY Times will be at your door weekdays to peruse over breakfast, as will the TVs -- we had a new 42\" LCD in the living room, and a 32\" in the bedroom. Prior reviews marvelling at the tiny old TVs may be outdated, or we were just lucky, but both rooms we were in had the new TVs. The midtown location puts Grand Central, the Empire State, Times Square and more within walking distance. You'll be a good ten minutes to any subway platform, but the nearest subway entrance is closer (then you walk a few blocks underground.)

We booked a one-bedroom suite for about $325 per night directly with the hotel. When we checked in, we found that the mini-kitchen that we had been promised was a wet bar and small refrigerator only. The hotel misinformed me on that one. We also learned that the love seat in the living room was not a pull-out sleeper. (When I reconsulted the website, I believe I was the one in error on that one.) When I went down to the desk to register my displeasure, the desk clerk told me I could have a rollaway bed for $20 per night. I asked him to make it complimentary, and he had the on-duty manager speak to me. The manager was adamant about charging me the $60 for 3 nights, even after I told him that I was a loyal, repeat visitor on my fourth stay. It was pretty funny, then, when the desk clerk said to the manager, sotto voce, \"I think you should give it to him at no charge.\" The manager relented. The suite was dingy. The bathroom was tiny. The shower had little water pressure and the most annoying habit, every time, of switching about every 30 seconds from scalding hot to very cold. I had to constantly readjust the temperature control, which itself had a \"hair-trigger\" and required micro adjustment to cause reasonable changes in temperature. The living room had tables with lamps at either end. One tiny problem: they weren't plugged in, and there was no electrical outlet close enough to either of them in order for us to plug them in.

It will be better once the new lift is installed. Good range of eating places in the neighbourhood, doormen excellent at getting taxis! Value for money, yes...If you want luxury, try the Waldorf Astoria round the corner.

We chose the Helmsley based upon positive reviews we'd read on the Internet. And the price was reasonable. However, you may want to pass this one by. Unless being centrally located is at the top of your list of priorities. Our room was on the 6th floor. The carpet was old and very stained. The furniture is old-fashioned and rickety. In fact, the legs were coming off both the bourdoir chair and the vanity. We moved the armchair since no maid had done so...and discovered a wealth of dirt. The bed sags in the middle and the shower runs in spurts of molten hot and cold. The room was quite cool and it was unpleasant to work with the radiant heater since it was so dirty. The main elevators were not working so we shared the freight elevator with staff. Depending on the time of day like morning and supper time, the wait could be very long. The \"breakfast\" was not appealing; better off going to Grand Central Market and grabbing fresh pastry instead...and a coffee at a Starbucks. On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Any complaint was acted upon immediately. And the maid service was excellent. We could count on clean towels and clean bedding. Apparently, the main bank of elevators will be replaced by March which is good since the room prices nearly double in the spring. Would we stay here again? In spite of the room condition? Yes, because of the location. We could make our way anywhere in a very short period of time by subway, bus, taxi, or on foot. Anything one could want is within a reasonable walking distance from great restaurants to Rockefeller Plaza. Grand Central station is about 10 minutes away and Lexington Avenue is a wonderful adventure. Advice: Try to book a room on a higher floor.

The room was clean, but far from luxurious. The AC worked well but was very noisy when the compressor kicked on. The beds were comfortable, but the sheets and blankets were inferior. They appear to be on some sort of rolling room renovation program, so ask for a more recently renovated room to avoid some of the problems that other reviewers appear to have had. Either way, be prepared for the total lack of \"amenities\". Bottom line: If you catch the right rate and are not looking to spend alot of time at the hotel and/or don't want or need alot of amenities, it's fine.

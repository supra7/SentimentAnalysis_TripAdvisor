I've had two very good experiences there- one with a loved one and the other with a group of high school students I was accompanying to a Model U.N. conference at the Hynes Convention Center. For the first experience, they allowed me to check-in early and prepare the hotel room- as I was trying to surprise my girlfriend who was returning from a trip overseas. Their pristine and classy rooms and ultra-comfortable sleigh beds and high-thread-count sheets provided for the perfect evening and morning. For the second experience, I always felt the group was looked after and the proximity to the Convention Center was incredibly useful given the group's constant activity during the M.U.N. conference.

I chose this location due to its proximity to the Hynes Convention Center were I was taking a very stressful licensing exam. I had many issues with my room including overly hot temperatures, dirty pillow cases, a mini-fridge whose temperature was set too high (all the contents became frozen causing a soda to explode all over my exam materials), AND a bathtub that was not properly set in its foundation. I honestly expected more from this hotel, and it added more stress to an already stressful two days of exams. However, despite all these issues, the front desk and engineering department were great. Mario in engineering should receive an award for his patience he had with me. Although I was offered another room for my last night, I decided against it because I needed to study. I think it's important to voice your concerns in order for the hotel staff to do their best possible to remedy their situation and for the hotel to improve/learn from their mistakes.

The food at Doyle's is incredible. The pool area and workout rooms are top notch and the staff was amazing. They even sent a complimentary cheese plate and two Boston Lagers with a hand written note wishing me a happy 30th birthday....very nice and classy touch! The rooms were very nice (layout as expected, but very nice aesthetic touches here and there). Celebrated the big day at Gypsy Bar (very trendy, high class...and very expensive!!!) If you're looking for bars, try Storyville (nice lounge) as well as Beantown Pub. The hotel definitely stands out and it certainly made for a great backdrop to an unforgettable birthday.

The thing that always sets an hotel apart for me is the staff, at the end of the day lots of hotels in Boston are similar to the Hilton, but the staff takes very good care of you here. One example was when I was returning to the hotel at night and because of a party there were no parking spots. The doorman talked to the manager and found us a spot in the \"permit\" parking area, going out of their way to assist us. The rooms have been recently renovated and were very nice. They were a good size, very comfortable bed, sofa, desk area and HDTV. I liked the updates to the room with the exception that they have bolted the balcony doors closed so you can't go out anymore. One thing I do like about the rooms however is you can open the window for fresh air which is rare downtown and something I always appreciate. The hotel is a perfect size, not monolithic and crowded like some of the surrounding hotels so you never feel crowded. They have a great workout area and indoor pool and a starbucks in the lobby.

This property is perfectly located in close proximity to many of Boston's cultural, dining, and shopping venues, and was for us a perfect home away from home. Commercial property available for new hotel construction has been virtually non-existent in Boston's congested downtown and Back Bay areas for decades. This would explain why the Hilton, a relatively recent arrival to the Boston hotel scene, is appreciably smaller than, for example, the much larger and older Sheraton directly across the street, which has the advantages and disadvantages of being integrated into the Hynes Convention Center and Prudential Center complexes. The Hilton, on the other hand, has a very small triangular footprint on a tiny lot and is only 26 stories tall; this gives it the unexpected and highly welcome ambience of a European-style boutique hotel rather than a big-city American commercial property. The feel of a boutique hotel was reinforced by the front desk staff, housekeeping staff, and other lobby service personnel, who were all extremely friendly, efficient, helpful, and solicitous, almost to a fault. We were greeted by one or more staff members each time we passed through the lobby. This level of personalized service is quite remarkable, even by high Hilton corporate standards, and especially so for this city. Bostonians in general have a well-earned reputation for being rather unfriendly and xenophobic; the thought idly occurred to me that perhaps all of the Hilton's staff had been recruited from non-natives imported from elsewhere. The room rates and parking fees are rather steep, as is normal for big-city hotels. The adjacent parking garage was well-maintained and convenient to the lobby. As Hilton Gold members. we were given a free upgrade to a corner room, which is somewhat larger, asymmetrical, and appreciably less claustrophobic than the standard rectilinear rooms. Our room seemed to have been recently rehabbed and was nicely decorated and well-equipped, including a large flat screen HDTV with a generous assortment of digital channels. The free breakfast served in the executive lounge was somewhat more limited in selection but far higher in quality and freshness than the standard breakfast fare served in Hampton Inns and Hilton Garden Inns in the Hilton family - in fact, it was much better than the restaurants in most Hilton hotels as well. We plan to give their adjacent 40 Dalton restaurant, which shares a common kitchen, a try on our next stay. All in all, this was one of the most satisfying and rewarding Hilton experiences we have had in recent years.

If you want to zip back and forth from meeting to your room stay here or the Sheraton The only negative was that the panoramic rooms have poor heating in the fall due to a design flaw in the heating coils of the vents. Apparently this is not an issue in the winter when the entire building is heated but is a factor in the fall before central heating is turned on. They sent an engineer right up to make a few changes but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help much.

The room was very clean, and had top quality bed linens and thick, absorbent bath towels, as well. The bath amenities were also very nice, and were replaced both mornings of our stay, which is nice. It's easy to get a cab here, if need be - they are lined up just down the street from the hotel, and the bellmen will call them for you. Also, it is a 1/2 block walk to the Prudential Center, which is an indoor mall, including many restaurants, as well as the more upscale Copley Plaza. Also, there is a T stop in the Prudential Center (green line) which can take you to other parts of the city. The hotel is 2 T stops from Northeastern Univ., where we were going, but if you have a nice day, as we did, it's also a nice walk - about 5 blocks or so.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay in Boston at the Hilton Boston Back Bay\u201d", "Author": "randy794", "ReviewID": "UR117629642", "Content": "We took a four day trip to Boston and stayed at the Hilton Boston Back Bay.

I requested a late check out on one of the rooms as we had an evening flight and offered to pay the fee but was given a complimentary late check out which made our last day so much more enjoyable. The front desk staff was friendly and answered our questions about getting around town. The bellcaps were also very friendly greeting us every time we entered or exited the hotel and directing us the best way to get to places. As well as getting us a big enough cab to the airport. Our rooms were very clean and kept restocked and tidy by our housekeeper each day. She was always in our hall when we left for the day with a \"good morning\" and had our rooms ready for our late afternoon return. The bathrooms are tight but nicely updated, plenty of towels. Our rooms had a mini-bar type of fridge that we stored water bottles in which was great since it was so hot in Boston our week. Beds were comfortable, good tv's and comfy chair. We were also given free wi-fi, guess that is an Honors perk. As Honors Gold members we were given the complementary continential breakfast in the Diamond room next to the restaurant. The gentleman in charge of the room was wonderful. So polite, friendly and couldn't do enough to make sure you had what you wanted or needed. Our family found the selections to be just fine, scrambled eggs, yogurts, cereals, bagels, pastry and fresh fruits (we don't eat oatmeal but it was there too). Having that right in the hotel was so helpful and a money saver in a big city. We used the business center computers and printers for both our boarding passes and aquarium/whale watch tickets. It was a huge time saver on the aquarium tickets as there was a long (hot) line out front when we arrived so it was nice to have our tickets in hand. The location is very convenient to the Prudential T stop (green line) for subway use(one block away).

Immediately confirmed my request for a river view room and offered a high floor room choice too, plus confirmed that a parcel I'd arranged to be shipped to the hotel was waiting. Whether it's good selection, staff training or staff that naturally enjoy their job but found all the hotel staff were also excellent. Room was a good size, nicely decorated in cream/browns with green accents, complete with a chaise longue provided as an extra finishing touch. Large workdesk and good range of TV channels on large flatscreen TV too meant both business and relaxation requirements also met. Bed was exceptionally comfortable with plentiful pillows and excellent quality bed linens. Housekeeping standards - which very unobtrusive during my stay, while overall, there was minimal corridor/other guest noise - were very high. Bathroom possibly on the small side for two sharing but again, immaculate and a range of quality toiletries, hairdryer and plentiful supply of towels available. Fabulous views of the boats on Charles River and the Back Bay area, so glad this request was met and in such a gracious manner too. Gym/swimming pool area was exceptionally tidy and well presented, excellent locker/bathroom facilities even down to little finishing touches such as body lotion and mouthwash, with excellent quality towels provided. Compact lobby had everything a traveller/tourist needed, included a Starbucks/snack area & complimentary computer access, (both tended to be understandably busy in the morning with conventioneers heading across the street to the Sheraton but rarely a queue at other times of the day), a comfortable seating area, concierge desk, (which was particularly helpful dealing with requests which these staff must hear 100 times a week but still went the extra mile to deliver as if it was the first time) and even a device to wrap dripping wet umbrellas in at the lobby entrance! Back Bay location is both a great neighbourhood and base for exploring Boston, with both the Prudential & Copley T-stations nearby and taxis/tour bus pick-up available outside.

First of all, the service is first rate from the moment one walks through the door, to the front desk, to room service, breakfast room, all with a sincere desire to please the customer. Our room was spick-and-span clean--no hidden corners with dustballs, etc; linens were fresh, glasses sparkled, 5 pillows added to the comfort. As for value: the hotel's website listed numerous \"specials\" and we took advantage of such a rate. Location is ideal: steps from the Prudential Center and all its shops. We walked to the Boston Symphony for a performance. Fenway Park for BoSox fans is a walk away. Fortunately, the MBTA Green Line is in the Prudential Center and is the perfect T Stop for short trips to the Museum of Fine Arts, Isabella Stewart Gallery, the North End, Government Center, Copley Square, and College stops. Cambridge is fairly close as well. Purchase a $15.00 weekly T Pass and you are set for travel in Beantown using the Hilton Back Bay as your center.

The hotel was perfect. So, I recommended it to our friends and ourselves and returned in October. We waited two hours for our room which took us to about 4:00 pm. Upon entering the room, the carpet hit me immediately as being very spotted (icky.) We went ahead and settled in but couldn't regulate the heat/air conditioning unit, and the tv would not work. A maintenance man was sent and told us too many people were using the television sets. That's why it wouldn't work. What? He also gave us a tip to put the heat on low and dial up to 80 degrees. We put up with that, but it wasn't very efficient. Then we begin to shower, but the shower doors were horrible- all rickety and extremely hard to move. Our one lady friend to whom we had recommended this hotel was stuck inside her shower and couldn't get out. Her husband was finally able to move the door enough for her to squeeze out. He reported the problem and maintenance took the door off and put up a shower curtain. The following morning, our television still wouldn't work, so I took the remote down to the desk and asked them to give us one that would work. I also asked about the very spotted and dirty carpet. She said she would move us but that another room may have the same dirty carpet. She said she couldn't inspect each and every room for dirty carpet. She didn't impress me AT ALL. There was one concierge who was able to give us some information, but the other two just stared at me when I asked a question. They simply didn't know anything. Even though this Hilton Hotel is located well for us, we will find another place to stay next time we are in Boston. It was embarrassing to have recommended the Hilton to our friends. There was one high point during our stay, and that was the wonderful man who staffs the free breakfast for Diamond members.

When we Emailed the manager the implication was that we would be booking a pretty good room (\"Superior Corner Room\") but that an upgrade may be available to a \"River View\" room. This was not forthcoming so he was given vouchers for a \"Continental\" breakfast. We checked that this was correct as, at other Hilton-brand hotels we'd been given an excellent full breakfast in lieu of upgrade. But that was their policy so we suffered the meanest (ie most miserly) of breakfasts we'd encountered on our whole tour involving stays at 18 different hotels. Well done Hilton. This was worse than any Comfort Inn or Best Western Continental breakfast we had come across. Having said this, the waitress (from Eastern Europe, perhaps?) who was attending to breakfast could not have been more helpful and friendly. It's just a pity she had so little material to work with! This somewhat spoiled our stay here as did the rather limited public space, much of which was taken up by a dreaded Starbucks. Hotel staff (Bell hops and Reception staff) we friendly enough but this hotel did not have the feel of a big-city hotel as the whole approach was somewhat amateurish. There was no official valet parking but the guys at the door were happy to do this for you - at your own risk I guess! The room was good. A nice view (away from the river!). The corner was wasted, though, as no extra furniture was provided. Just one lounge chair in the room when there was easily enough room for a 2nd comfy chair in the large empty space next to the computer desk. Two in a room so why not two chairs to sprawl in??

In town for a Red Sox game (already a costly proposition), I shrugged off the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s typically astronomical hotel prices and opted for the Hilton Boston Back Bay for its proximity to Fenway. The Hilton generally delivered on quality but the final tab, inflated by a laundry list of taxes and fees, was as frustrating as a line drive off the Green Monster by a visiting batter. WHAT WAS GOOD: The location is perfect for any activity or attraction in the Back Bay, including Fenway Park. Boston is a horrible driving city so being able to walk or take the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a huge plus. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unlimited number of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small but adequate pool, spa and fitness center on the seventh floor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Service was excellent throughout our one-night stay. Every member of the staff was friendly and accommodating. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER: Walls are paper-thin; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear conversations spoken in a normal tone when the television and fan are off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.This is an urban hotel, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not particularly shocking that floor space is limited. We expected a bit more leg room for the price, however\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Some reviewers raved about the views from the higher floors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely not the case at the lower levels. Our fourth floor view was of a dreary industrial side street\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.My biggest knock on this place is the price and the fee structure. With an already steep base rate, the add-ons were a real drag on the wallet: $39 for parking, $25 for a rollaway bed, $15 for internet, plus the already outrageous state and local taxes; you get the picture. THINGS TO KNOW: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seven-story parking deck but only a six-floor elevator.

Great location, and the room was typically HIlton: very good bed, and a spacious-enough room with fairly utilitarian appointments. The only functional problem was the heat: the thermostat would only go down to 65, which is too warm for sleeping as far as I'm concerned. So I turned off the heating system and opened a window, and was then comfortable except for the traffic noise (which would have been even worse had I not been on the 21st floor). Overall, a nice room at a reasonable price. My breakfast at 40 Dalton (the hotel restaurant) the next morning was another matter, though. I was seated promptly by a very pleasant hostess, and then handed off to a waiter who asked what I'd like to drink. I told him water would be fine, which must have offended him, because he basically never served me after that. After a long wait, the hostess came by and asked if I'd had a chance to order. I said no, and she took my order. She also brought me my food -- a breakfast panini, which was excellent. When I ran out of water my waiter was still AWOL, so I ended up asking the busgirl to bring me some, which she did. When I was halfway through my sandwich, my waiter came by and plunked my bill down on top of the paper I was reading, and walked away. Needless to say, he got no tip.

This hotel is centrally located to the \"T\" Green Line between the Prudential and Hynes stations, two blocks from the shopping and restaurant district on Newberry Street, three blocks from the NEU and BU campus' and about four or five blocks from Fenway Park. There is also a great wine store about a block away from the Hilton on Massachusetts Avenue! I made our hotel reservation at priceline.com with a bid of $71.00 for a three and a half star hotel in the Back Bay area of Boston (we were in Boston in April 2009 and we got the Marriott Copley for $71.00 on priceline). I checked another site, www.betterbidding.com and found another person that stayed over the same dates that we did at the Hilton paid just $64.00 on priceline. Unfortunately the Marriott Copley was at something like $120.00 per night over our dates. I called ahead to the Hilton and requested a high floor, corner room because the community on Trip Advisor advised that these rooms were a little larger and they were located away from the elevators and ice maker noise. The only problems we experienced were: 1. The carpet in the room didn't look dirty but when you walked barefoot or with socks on, your feet tuned black almost immediately. I called housekeeping and requested them to shampoo the main areas of the room and they complied the next morning! Make sure you leave a $2.00 tip for the housekeeper each morning and they will make certain you have plenty of bottled water, clean towels and extra bath amenities daily! 2. The thermostat in the guest rooms can't be adjusted by you (even though it looks like you can adjust the temperature from the thermostat), it can actually only be adjusted by the hotel maintenance manager from his computer. The first four nights, we felt like we were sleeping in a refrigerator. I let the front desk know about the problem each morning for the first four days in a row and the problem finally got taken care of on September 3rd. I was a little upset that we froze our butts off for the first four nights, but the front desk staff shut me up by giving me three coupons for a full American breakfast for the next two mornings. Some tips for you: 1. Wireless Internet access is $14.95 for each 24 hour period in your guest room but it is free in the lobby area. I went down to the lobby the first day to connect my laptop to the Hilton's free wireless service, I then left my laptop connected and took the elevator back up to my room. The WIFI service stayed connected for free! It will automatically disconnect every 24 hours, so you have to repeat this process daily. This saved me almost $90.00 over our 6 night stay! 2. Hilton Honors members (Gold or better) have access to a complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby restaurant. We called the waiter The breakfast Nazi because he seemed to be mad every day, but all in all, the breakfast was sufficient as it consisted of eggs of the day, fresh fruit, oatmeal, bagels, juice and coffee. 3. Parking is something like $37.00 per night. That's more than half of the cost that we paid for the guest room, so you are better off using public transportation if at all possible! 4. We purchased three, 7 day Charlie Cards for $15.00 each upon arrival at Logan Airport (ticket machines are at the baggage claim area). I read on Trip Advisor about how easy it was to take the \"T\" from the airport to the Hilton (take the free airport shuttle bus from the curb at baggage claim to the Blue Line inbound, Transfer to the Green Line at Government Center and then catch any Green Line B, C or D outbound to to the Hynes station and walk two blocks to the Hilton or take the Green Line E outbound and exit at Prudential station and walk through the mall to the Sheraton hotel, the Hilton is across the street from the Sheraton). We saved $40.00 to $45.00 on taxi fare from the airport and another $30.00 back to Logan when we departed and we used the \"T\" and the bus system to get around Boston for the entire week to shop and get to the North End. We also went to the New England Patriots game on Thursday night and we found (on Trip Advisor) that there is a special MBTA commuter train that will take you from the Back Bay station in Boston directly to Foxboro Stadium for just $12.00 per person, round trip. This is a great deal as the train only makes three other stops along the way and it only takes about 45 minutes to get from Boston to Foxboro Stadium. The train leaves the stadium for the return trip to Boston about 30 minutes after the conclusion of the game (you don't want to miss this return train as the stadium is in the middle of nowhere). 5. The North End area of Boston is full of great but over priced Italian restaurants. We found on our last trip to Boston that La Famiglia Giorgio's ([--] or www.lafamigliagiorgio.com) one block off of Hanover Street to be a great \"family style\" restaurant. The three of us shared a large Caesar salad, an order of steamed mussels, the daily special lasagna, my wife had a glass of wine and I had an Italian beer (this was enough to feed the three of us and have leftovers to take with us) and the check was under $70.00 including a 17% tip for the wait staff! We then walked over to Modern Pastry Shop on Hanover Street to pick up a few chocolate dipped, ricotta cheese filled cannolis for dessert. These are to die for and they are only about $3.50 or so each. Just remember that the cannolis at Modern are much better than Mike's Pastry Shop! 6. I went to restaurant.com and purchased a $50 restaurant certificate for Kingston Station located at 25 Kingston Street or call [--] (another Trip Advisor suggestion) for just $20.00. The stipulation is that you have to purchase at least $100 at the restaurant which is no problem if you have a glass of wine, share appetisers and an entree each. It worked out to be about a 30% discount once you added in the gratuity and the food and service were great! Make sure you try the truffle fries, They are awesome! You can take the Green Line and walk three blocks to the restaurant (sorry, I forgot the stop). Hope these tips help you to enjoy Boston on the cheap as much as we did... I'd also like to thank the entire Trip Advisor community for pointing us in the right direction and suggesting such great things to see and do while we were there.

I booked the hotel with the knowledge that is is well located (I had previously stayed at the Sheraton across the street). The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the T (subway) stop at Prudential Center and this was handy as I had travelled from the airport by T. A tip - if it is wet when you arrive and your travelling to the Hilton by T, go through the Sheraton hotel as you can walk through the Prudential Center and into the Sheraton completely undercover. You then only have a walk across the street to the Hilton (cheeky, yes, but it will keep you dry!) I arrived around 2pm and check in was fast and welcoming. I had a deluxe room on the 25th floor. The room itself was a good size, with a king size bed which is very comfy and a huge flat screen TV with around 45 channels. There is also a desk and comfy chair. The bathroom is small, but adequate with a shower/bath. My shower head needed to be propped up with some tolietries, but was fine otherwise. There were a good array of amenities. Internet access (wireless) is $15 a day. I chose to eat breakfast in the hotel restaurant - 40 Dalton - on day one, as it was convenient to do this. Service was OK but I felt the cost was expensive relative to the food on offer - personally I was expecting more from a North Amercian hotel and I was therefore a little disappointed. I also thought the $6 for a jug of coffee was a bit much considering I was travelling alone! I ordered from room service a couple of nights - food was good but the service charges were astronomic - $4 tray charge plus 16.5% service charge plus 5.5% admin charge!! I used the fitness center and found this more than adequate - plenty of towels, a reasonable range of equipment (which seems quite new) and a pool and whirpool - nice after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is only a few minute walk from Newbury Street and from there it is a 10-15 minute to Downtown. So, all in all, my stay was OK, but I suppose I'm not feeling blown away by the hotel.

The staff is exceptional ... helpful ... warm ... opening doors, holding the elevator, fulfilling requests promptly and always going the extra distance, even when you don't tip them. Everyone remember my name and my daughter's name and always went out of the way to make us feel welcome. The lobby is very modern and spacious with so many comfortable arm charis, wide screen TV, several complimentary computers with high speed internet, a Starbucks cafe and restaurant, and a semi-private lounge-nook right outside the restaurant that is perfect to work or study away from the hussle and bussle of the main lobby. The wi-fi is free in the lobby too. We stay twice for a week each time. On our first visit we had a superior king room (room 2318). The view was of the Prudential Center ... very nice. The room amenities were all top of the line. Modern decour, new everything. Very nice, though a bit limited in floor space. It's fine for one or two people, but we had our two year old with us, and it was a little tight. The second visit we were in the superior king corner suite with balcony (room 2205). It is very spacious and perfect for a little one to run around in! Excellent room, highly recommend you stay in this room (if you don't book one with a panoramic view, which won't have the balcony). The view was of the downtown, the Charles River, MIT across the water, and we could see Fenway Park from our Balcony and the window. It was a little bright during game nights, but the breeze off the water felt great. Sunrise through sunset and beyond, the view was fantastic. As the lighting changed, the mood of the view did. Something worth writing home about. The furniture, linens, toiletries and bathroom were all excellent quality and appearence. Marble top everything, flat wide screen TV, the works. The in room thermostat tells you the room temp as well as the outside temp (very helfpul when running out the door and needing to know if you should bring a jacket or not). The location is the best. Boylston is two blocks away, The Prudential Center mall is two blocks away ... Berklee School or Music and Christian Science Center (gorgeous to walk through and photograph) are two a half blocks away. Tons of great restaurants near by to choose from ... everything from Pizza to Seafood from Vietnamese to Indian from chain to authentic you can think of. There is a supermarket at the Prudential Center and a Trader Joe's across from the convention center. The restaurant in the hotel has delicious breakfast and the crab cakes are the best I've ever had! During out stay we got to know much of the staff by name, and it felt like good friends hosting us in a world-class guest room. Everything looked very clean and room service left the room spiffy clean each day. The chaise lounge and ergonomically designed desk chair were beyond comfortable. My daughter and I spent many hours lounging by the window watching the sail boats in the Charles River. There are two childrens' parks on West Newton, one and a half blocks past Huntington. You will see a Seven Eleven on the corner, then a laundry and dry cleaners, then you will see the sign for the first park on the right. It has stuff for 3-5 year olds and 5-11 year olds. If you cross at the cross walk on the left, and walk 1/2 block you will find an enclosed park with locked fences to keep the kids in that is perfect for babies and toddlers. I took my daughter almost every day. It's a great area to walk around. I've included pictures of the views from both rooms, as well as the bathroom, which has glass tiles on the accent wall above the sink.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntingdon Valley, PA", "Title": "\u201cNice Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Barcelonamom", "ReviewID": "UR21069462", "Content": "This was our second stay at Hilton Back Bay.

Whilst there we walked everywhere and if it was a little to far to walk, the hotel is handy to two subway (theT) stations. Rooms are clean and comfortable and we had ample storage. Unlike many hotels, the in room safe was big enough for our laptop. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful and the girl in the bar was a real star whilst we were there. The exception being, while we were there, the staff in the breakfast room. The first couple of days they were first class, but then we seemed to get a different couple of girls serve us and they were uninterested and one time we had to ask for our coffee four times before it arrived. They were the exception though and we just stopped having breakfast in the hotel, so it didn't spoil our stay. We did have dinner there one night as well, and they were great as well. We walked to Fenway Park to see the Redsox so if you want to take in a game, then this place is idealy placed. Shopping in the Prudential Center is just across the road and the bars and restaurants on Boylston Street are only a block or so away. We stayed in Boston for a week and didn't bother hiring a car, as much as I love driving in the States, it would have been a waste of money. The 'T' is fast, safe, cheap and frequent and if you buy a pass it is also valid on the 'T' buses as well giving great value. Give public transport ago. In Boston it is fine and the best way to get around. Having said that, if you do use public transport to go to Plymouth, then be warned. There are only a few trains a day and the station at Plymouth is two miles form the seafront, so either get a cab to the front or be prepaired for a hike! Plymouth is a nice and pleasant day out with plenty of historic things to see and do. Especailly nice are the crew on the Mayflower. They are dressed in period costume and will answer your questions in the language that they used at the time. We would recommend 'Isaac's' for lunch. wonderful service, views and food.

On Paper the Boston Hilton ticked all the right boxes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Unfortunately as much as we wanted to like the Hilton Back Bay, it continuously fell well short of our expectations. We really wanted to like this hotel, our room was nice, the foyer was nice, but ultimately it was let down by inept maintenance and shonky service. Visiting Boston in July meant it was extremely hot and most days we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d head back to the hotel looking forward to a swim in the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool. Unfortunately for most of our stay, the pool was closed for emergency maintenance, only being open for one day. Staff at the front desk blamed the contractors maintaining the pool and although they offered us free dinner or breakfast, the lack of a pool, really did put a negative on our stay at the Hilton. If that had been the only issue we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have been slightly annoyed but things however didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get better from there.

What could have been the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saving grace turned out to be a fizzer as most of these channels barely worked, with the TV showing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No Signal Message\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more often than a picture. Adding further insult to injury, the free wifi was available in the Hilton's foyer, whilst for some bizarre reason they opted to charge an astonishing US$12 per day for access to the very same wireless in guest rooms. Having stayed in numerous hotels during the month we spent in the USA, the Hilton seemed to be the only hotel that we had any major problems with. If smaller hotels can properly maintain their pools, provide free Wifi and have TVs that work why can't a multinational chain like the Hilton get it right???

It was average sized and very comfortable with a nice desk and desk chair and comfortable sitting chairs. My view was nothing special, but I think it's unfair to cut a hotel to pieces in a review over their view (unless you personally requested a room with a view), as it is often something that they don't have much control over. As for the location, it's very central to to the city. The Heinz convention center (where my convention was convening) is a short walk away and this is very nice, especially if the weather is bad, which it was while I was theret. There are a few good restaurants around and a very, very upscale mall in the area which was fun to wander around. The doormen are very knowledgable about the area and about transportation and always greeted me warmly when I left or returned to the hotel. Little things like that get big marks in my book, because it is often that one smiling face or that one extra helpful person you remember from a stay at a hotel. The one thing that exceeded my expectations was the restaurant. It's called Boodles, which is a funny name for a restaurant, but they can get away with it because I had one of the best meals of my life there. It's very classy and my waitress treated me like a VIP. The food came in courses and each one was better than the last. I have heard that this establishment has gone down hill since my stay there, so you might want to read some other, more recent reviews, but I have nothing but good things to say about it. Just make sure that you bring a big appetite to Boodles, because your not going to feel hungry for a day afterwards you'll be so full.

The sound seems to reverberate through the room, -- not loud at all, but still noticeable. I suspect that the rooms to the north side might have less of this problem since they are not adjacent to the back wall of the elevators. Perhaps even rooms further up would experience less of this noise. 2. somehow cigarette smoke was occasionally coming into the room through the bathroom vent . It was not visible, but it was definitely very noticeable. We could not determine if the adjacent room neighbor was smoking in his/her bathroom or if it was coming from the 8th floor which apparently is the smoking floor. There was no active exhaust action happening in the vent from what I could tell, rather, air was coming into the bathroom from the vent. Either way, the bathroom venting seemed inadequate to keep this from being rather annoying. Again, perhaps rooms on higher floors would not have this issue due to the greater distance from the smoking floor.

I booked my room at the Hilton on Priceline for $65 (~$80 with taxes/fees). The hotel is not what I would call easy to get to driving wise, but certainly very easy to get to with public transportation by getting off at the Prudential stop (as a footnote, if you are flying into logan or taking the train into Boston, I do NOT recommend taking the subway directly to the hotel if you have big luggage... the green line of the T is VERY hard to accomodate luggage on as the cars are pretty small... I would suggest a cab). A LOT of things are within walking distance of this hotel, including Fenway Park, Newbury Street (a lot of high-end stores and nice cafes and restaurants), Copley Square, the Prudential Center, Berklee College of Music, and others. And obviously once you're there, you can take the T to just about anything in Boston. Now, on to the staff... I was traveling with my wife and a friend of ours, so when I went to check in, I requested a room with two double beds (knowing that Priceline only guarantees double occupancy, but it doesn't hurt to ask). I was told by Brendan (the man checking us in) that there were no two-double rooms available, but they could put a rollaway bed in our king room for $20 for the night. We agreed, and away to our room we went. After checking in, we walked around Boston a bit to see the sights and came back several hours later. We get back to our room, and still no rollaway bed there. So, I call the front desk to see where it is, turns out they are sold out of them, but there is a two-double room available that we can go right into! Now, obviously someone needs to get their act together and know what is and isn't available, because obviously Brendan didn't have a clue. Overall a great stay and would be pleased to stay here again.

They left the booking up to me, and although the convention was at the BCEC (down near the waterfront - not close to the Back Bay), the Hilton Back Bay had decent prices for the weekend and I knew it was close to good restaurants and whatnot. We arrived very late due to flight delays, but were happy with our room. 5th floor (no view unfortunately), but two double beds which were VERY comfortable (especially the pillows). Room was a decent size. We liked the location since it seemed to be right in the middle of a nice area. The doorman was very helpful the next morning -- we were only about 2 1/2 blocks from the subway station (which we were going to take to the convention -- we bought a weekly pass for the T for $15 each). We stopped at Dunkin' Donuts on the corner by the hotel for breakfast and hopped on the T. Only about 25 minute subway ride (a few switches) to the BCEC. After a tiring day at the convention, we knew we wanted to go out and have a good time that evening. We were already planning on going to a Red Sox game on Friday night, but figured we'd try getting tickets for the Thursday game too. Fenway is an easy 5-10 minute walk from the Hilton -- very convenient! Had a blast at the game both nights, and it was nice to be so close to the hotel afterwards. Our room was very clean (except for Saturday -- housekeeping didn't make it up until about 3:30 in the afternoon, when we were back in the room napping), comfortable, and every staff member was very courteous and good with directions to places (Summer Shack is right up the road if you need a quick seafood fix). Unfortunately, we didn't venture into the Prudential Center area at all, but did take the T down to Fanuel Hall/Quincy Marketplace, which was a straight shot 15 minute ride. The free computers w/ internet in the lobby was a nice touch too - I was able to check my email and print my plane tickets for the ride home in advance. We had to hail a cab to and from the airport b/c we arrived after the T stopped running and left before it started running, but if you arrive during normal running hours (5:45am - 1:45am or so), this wouldn't be a bad option, especially since the cab ride will cost you at least $20 (and like I said, a weekly pass on the T is $15 a person, so this could be a better option depending on how many are in your party). The hotel staff was very friendly even at 4am - getting a cab was no problem (they had a few waiting). Overall, I'd recommend Hilton Back Bay to anyone taking a trip to Boston -- it's in a nice area, w/in walking distance to lots of restaurants, shops, and attractions, and is fairly close to a subway station to navigate around downtown on.

We ordered an extra large room, but to be honest, we didn't notice. We were on the HHonours floor, right over the main entrance. So first the good. The location is fantastic.

The Jacuzzi was good and hot. There's no real bad, just a list of small niggles that add up. For example, when we entered the room initially, we were literally overpowered by the smell of chemical cleaner - maybe a carpet cleaner? While the room was clean, it was old and showed in places. Being above the front entrance was a real pain, cos the porter kept whistling for cabs all the time. A shrill high-pitched whistle, which woke us up at 7am one morning.

I will continue to stay there for the next few weeks while I visit Boston. Location The hotel is located on a quite side street, right next to a Sheraton Hotel and the Church of Christ, Scientist (which I have never visited but it looks like an elegant building). It is ~3 minutes walk away from many shops & restaurants at the Prudential Center (PF Changs, Cheesecake Factory) and ~5-10 minutes walk away from tons of good places on Boylston Street and the parallel street, the tony Newbury Street. It takes less than 10 minutes to get to the Boston Common in a cab, which are easily available outside the Sheraton. Room I always stay in the same room on the 26th floor, which has huge curved windows all the way around one side of the room with a fantastic view of the West side of Boston from Fenway Park to the Prudential Center. Room furnishings are good and I love the huge wide-screen HDTV, and the coffee maker stocked with Lavazza coffee. The bathroom has a great shower with 2 large showerheads so you get deluged with water from both sides.

The hotel is in an excellent location -- within walking distance to much of what Boston has to offer. We used no public transportation during our stay (except to and from the airport), but had easy access to the T, and readily available taxis if we desired. Tour Trolley stops and Duck Tour boarding areas are nearby. One late morning, we walked from the hotel to the beginning of the Freedom Trail and completed the Freedom Trail, taking time to stop at various places -- shopping at Quincy Market, lunch at Durgin Park, touring Paul Revere's house and the USS Constitution, and walked back to the hotel by mid-evening. This may be too much walking for some, but if you find yourself exhausted, public transportation is readily available, be it the T, a taxi, or a bus to get you back to the hotel. We had a late dinner at Boodles (the hotel restaurant) the evening we arrived. The service was efficient and courteous, and the food was surprisingly tasty. We also had breakfast at Boodles the morning we departed. The buffet offered a good variety, and a breakfast menu was also available. The hotel fitness center has recently been remodeled and offers a good number of cardio machines, universal equipment, free weights, complimentary cold bottled water, locker rooms, a pool and spa. Note: my husband stayed on the following week for business and moved to the Sheraton across the street. His comment was that he much preferred the Hilton Back Bay -- larger room, better amenities. Being from Phoenix, we've had little subway experience and were somewhat hesitant to take the T. However, after riding in a taxi to drop me at the airport for departure, my husband experimented with the T and found that it is an easy T ride between the airport and the Back Bay area. We plan to use the T in lieu of a $40+ taxi ride to/from the airport during future visits to Boston. We had originally planned to stay at the Hilton Financial District, but after touring Boston, I am glad we chose the Back Bay. Currently, the Financial District is not as attractive. They are readying an area for a greenbelt/park of sorts resulting from the Big Dig. But, at this time, it is appears to be more of a vacant lot.

The lobby was pleasant enough -- a bit on the small side compared to other Hiltons that I have stayed at before. Check-in proceeded quite quickly. The reception staff were excellent and efficient. The room was pretty, but rather small. However, I was surprised that they wanted to charge a fee for internet access. At 2:30 AM, we were awakened by a very loud alarm, eminating from the room radio. A fire alarm had gone off and we were instructed to proceed to the stairwells to begin our descent. This was OK, except we were staying on the 26th floor. The other guests (quite elderly) and I (mid-50's) started the trek down. After 15 floors, we noticed that very few other guests were in the stairwell, nor was the alarm ringing on the 11th floor, where we had all stopped to rest. Attempts to reach the lobby staff were unsuccessful -- the phone kept ringing repeatedly with no pickup. I sent my stepdaughter (23) to proceed down the stairwell to check out what the problem was. She phoned me back 15 minutes later that the alarm had been a false one. I then called the lobby staff to see when the elevators would be operational again. They assured me within 5 minutes. After waiting for 20 minutes with still no elevator service, I then started my ascent up 15 stories. By the time I had reached my room, it was 4 AM. We learned from the front desk the next morning that someone had smoked in a non-smoking room on our floor and set off the alarm. I felt like this hotel had no formalized procedures in place for handing the possibility of a fire. Somehow, I wondered why they didn't have a PA system in the firewell, that could have told us that this was a false alarm, before we had trekked down so many flights of stairs. I was irritated by the front desk, lying to me, telling me that the elevators would be operational within 5 minutes. It isn't the hotel's fault that some yahoo was smoking at 2:30 AM, but the communication was lost between them & their guests. When I flew back to TX the next day, I heard from the passengers in the seat beside mine, that they had also stayed at the same Hilton. They said they had seen the fire trucks arrive and leave our hotel within 15 minutes. And their alarm never sounded on the 3rd floor, where they were staying.

Hotels were full and we were booked at $285.00 rate which is way steep for this hotel. My biggest concern on booking was staying somewhere central, and assuring a courtesy shuttle as I had 3 extra large suitcases in tow. Our first encounter was there was no courtesy shuttle. When I didn't see their name on the airport shuttle phones, I called the hotel and was told to just get a cab. I was a bit miffed. Aside from the pictures of a high rise, and comparable to adjacent hotels, this is a small property. On check in I informed them on the mis-comm on the shuttle to no avail, no apology. I wasn't sure the clerk even understood me. The porters stood and watched us get our luggage on a cart and get it to the room - I think we were just tired from a long day of travel, and i was expecting the big city service. The room was comfortable. The bathroom very, very small. After dinner we headed out looking at other hotels to move as we felt the price was too high for what we had received so far. When I returned i looked on the Travelocity site and the rates had dropped to $219, so I requested our rate be dropped also. The clerk was courteous and did so and we stayed. Overall experience was not unpleasant, but not great. The gym is newly remodeled and machines were good. I was surprised there was no sauna. The Sheraton across the street appeared much nicer and their rates were comparable. We walked through there to get to the very upscale mall, which opens into the Sheraton. In looking at all the hotels i was searching on the sites pre-trip, they are all within a few blocks of each other and all a couple of blocks from the \"T\" so any of them would have satisfied the 'central' goal. The same goes for the downtown/theatre district sites. We were out at the college campus, the north end for dinners, and also shopped and hit the museums so we walked a lot and took the \"T\" quite often. In retrospect, Boston is pretty walkable and the \"T\" made it very easy to get around. We could have stayed most anywhere in these areas - it's all very central.

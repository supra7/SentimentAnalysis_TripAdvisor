This hotel seemed to be the best option in terms of price, location and reviews so I went ahead and booked. On arrival on a wet Tuesday afternoon, the staff were extremely friendly and checked us in quickly. My parents-in-law had a room in the main inn building, whilst me, my wife and my baby daughter had a room in the small, four room extension accessed from the rear of the main inn. We were in one of the upper floor rooms. The room was spacious, light and airy, with a good-sized bathroom and a small dressing area with its own basin. There was a flatscreen tv with digital satellite box, a large, comfy bed and a travel cot for our daughter's use. An ice machine and drinks vending machine were located near the bottom of the external stairs going down to the courtyard, ie. very close by. The innkeeper made a reservation for us for dinner at an excellent Italian restaurant in Napa (located inside an old bank) and organised a taxi to take us there (who wants to drive when you're in Napa, after all!). Our sleep overnight was peaceful and sound, with no noise disturbing us from adjoining rooms or the outside world. In the morning we feasted on what can only be described as one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had. The homemade cakes and breads were to die for. As we checked out we all remarked to each other what a wonderful stay we'd had and that we hoped to return one day. Before returning to San Francisco, we visited the Beringer winery, where we took a tour, and stopped in at the Rubicon Estate winery (owned by Mr and Mrs Francis Ford Coppola no less). Both are well worth visiting, with extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff.

The room itself was very large. it also had another sink area in addition to the bathroom which made it nice. There were also plenty of towels. There was also free internet. The mattress was very soft and we like a firm one. The breakfast was very nice. They offered to make you waffles which we had one of the mornings. They were very good. They had some kind of fresh baked sweet each morning such as orange cranberry bread. At 6 pm they put out fresh baked cookies. We got there at 6:15 each night and there were hardly any cookies left. They also have 2 for 1 tasting coupons for some of the Napa wineries (but not for Sonoma wineries) in a box in the lobby. The staff was very nice and helpful.

Because this hotel was located at the busy street, expect to hear some traffic noise from outside especially when you stay at the ground level. The noise was bothering my mom and my sister and we found on the 3rd day that the both of our windows were 1/4 open. Did the cleaning lady open the window and forgot about closing it?

After our sticker-shock at such places as Harvest Inn, etc. we settled on the Elm House. We were skeptical, it being a Best Western and us having had mixed experiences with those, however what convinced us was it's #1 rating on this site, and the raving reviews of the breakfast. Well, I'm not so sure I'd rate it quite as high as #1, but certainly above Napa River Inn--rooms are a tad small, decor and furnishings are dated--however the breakfast is truly fantastic. The ladies in the kitchen will gladly make you a Belgian waffle or toast any of the assorted breads for you. There are always hard-boiled eggs, fruit and usually yogurt and hot oatmeal (as well as coffee and juice) available. Best part, breakfast is complimentary (they have a small tip jar by the coffee, since they clean up your table for you) so load up and then head out to the wineries!

After doing plenty of research on where I should stay, I discovered the Elm House Inn and had a gut feeling that this was the hotel I was looking for. When I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, I was met with a welcoming smile and the news that I was just in time for Cookie Hour, which I later learned would be my favorite hour of the day during my days spent in Napa. Guests were hanging out near the fireplace already enjoying homemade cookies, which were the most delicious cookies I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had (and I do love cookies). This moment gave me all the reassurance I needed to know that I made the right choice when choosing the Elm House Inn. The hotel was beyond lovely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my room was clean and had a huge television with plenty of channels for me to watch while I got ready for bed each night making me feel at home. The garden features a beautiful sitting area that is perfect for photos documenting your trip and the outside patio is a great option for having breakfast year round since there is a heater set up. Regardless of where you choose to enjoy your breakfast (indoors or outdoors), the Elm House Inn breakfast should not be missed. It was definitely not your average continental breakfast. There were fresh waffles and treats being made all morning and a delicious fruit salad offered to help kick start your day. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a full filled itinerary when you arrive for your time spent in Napa. Tom, Connie, and Kelly at the front desk all had suggestions for activities (not just limited to wine tasting, though they do have a wealth of knowledge in that department as well), and can help arrange reservations as well as winery visits for you. While there, I definitely had my fair share of wine (if you get the chance to visit Cakebread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their Chardonnay is the perfect glass to toast your vacation) and ate enough delicious meals within the few days to last me all month. Also, the Beer Can Chicken at Bounty Hunter (a close walk/drive from the Elm House Inn) definitely is a hit for dinner.

If you get the opportunity to visit Napa you will not be disappointed with your decision to stay at the Elm House Inn. The owners should be very proud of their beautiful hotel and pleased that they have such a great staff to help make the trip that much more enjoyable.

Ignore the fact it is a BW - this feels more like a family-run B&B than a chain hotel. It is on the road on the way into Napa town centre, so downtown in walkable in 20ish minutes but its easy to get out to the wineries. When we arrived, reception were chatty and welcoming, and told us about the 6pm cookies and milk. We really needed some dinner, so they gave us some walkable options that didn't take bookings (went to one, the Bounty Hunter, which was fantastic - great advice!) and said they would keep our cookies for us. And, as they said, we found them in our room under a pretty glass holder when we got back - and they were even more delicious than expected (tip: the next night we were around to get them at 6pm, and they were even better warm - make sure you're in)! Our room was out the back of the main building, on the ground floor of a sweet-looking house by the hot tub (a nice addition - we were the only people in it when we took a dip at 8.30pm). It was huge, quiet, had a great (enormous) bed, bath and massive shower - and seperate toilet. There was even a walk-in dressing room with mirror and spare sink. Breakfast also exceeded our expectations - it was in the open area behind reception, and as well as bagels, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, etc, they offer you huge homemade waffles to order. Get one if you have an appetite! Sadly, we probably won't be back in Napa soon, being from the UK, but I will certainly be telling all my friends and family to go if they are ever in the area.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evesham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c'Inn'credible Elm House-pitality\u201d", "Author": "bizzylizzy158", "ReviewID": "UR119389799", "Content": "Along with many other folk, we booked this hotel after reading the reviews on trip advisor, and I'm happy to say I agree with all the positive comments that have gone before and we weren't disappointed. Although a Best Western Hotel, the more impersonal elements of a chain hotel are not in evidence here. Elm House Inn was clean, bright and cheery. The staff were, without exception, helpful and absolutely charming. We stayed in two different rooms during our visit, both were a little bit pink for my taste, but both were comfortable and clean. Each room had a mini fridge, which is obviously handy during hot spells. We had an ipad with us and used the free WiFi signal with no problems. I would mention, the aircon was a wee bit noisy. Unlike other reviewers we heard no real street noise (except for a motorbike that seemed to go past at the same time every morning whilst we were there) but nobody can really crib at people going off to work for the day. There's a small garden which is very pretty and well tended. A baby squirrel put in an appearance when we were there and caused much hilarity and eeks from some quarters. There was a hot tub in the garden which we didn't use ourselves. The hotel provides a washing machine and dryer for use by the guests. You'll need four quarters for each. You can buy washing powder from reception for a dollar. The delicious Breakfasts made a great start to the day. Everything from bowls of Fruit to Muffins, Bagels and fantastic Waffles with Maple Syrup. We were to sample breakfasts at another Best Western in Carmel a few days later and there couldn't have been a starker difference between the two hotels. But where this hotel really scores top marks is the with it's owners and their staff. Having worked in the hospitality industry myself I know that some guests can be harder work than others and it can sometimes be tricky to keep smiling. But the team at this hotel do exactly that. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble and every member of staff seemed genuinely happy in their work. Father, daughter and staff should be proud of themselves for the level of service they offer at the Elm House Inn. They might consider running a few masterclasses for a few other hoteliers I can think of!! As for Napa itself. Oddly enough we found little to do in Napa. It takes about fifteen to twenty minutes easy walking to get to the centre. We did find the wines far far more expensive than in the UK. The weather was hot, so we actually drank more juice and the odd bottle of beer whilst we were there. If you're on a budget, try Sabor Bistro for supper. It's South American street food. They don't take reservations and you can see why, it was bustling when we went there. You can order a few dishes off the menu and and they will provide you with tasting plates so that you can share. As far as we could see, loads of locals were filling up the tables - and that's always a good recommendation. It's worth investigating the Uptown Theatre in Napa, they do seem to get a really decent variety of performers there. We were miffed to have missed Emmylou Harris who appeared there whilst we were in Napa. We only found out afterwards. Trips out. We visited Calistoga, further up the valley. It seems like a super little town, the locals are lovely and there are some nice shops. There's a super duper clothes shop for we ladies. If you like slightly more unusual clothes that stand out from the crowd (think sixties with a pinch of hippy, and a dash of Glastonbury) then go to Zenobia. Lisa the owner is absolutely charming. We felt like good friends by the time we left the shop. I bought a hat and wished I'd had more money and more room in my suitcase to buy loads of her lovely clothes. Try and visit the Yo El Rey organic coffee shop run by another lovely friendly Calistoga resident. Each cup is lovingly made. It takes a bit of time, but it's worth the wait. If you're of an arty persuasion try http://www.dirosapreserve.org/ We enjoyed one of their regular tours. What an amazing place. You get to visit the galleries and a house crammed full of 2000 pieces by more than 800 artists. The charming and knowledgeable volunteer guides show people around the galleries and then take you up to the main house in a Jinty (a little trailer with seats towed by a four wheel drive). They really look after disabled visitors by the way.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value for Napa\u201d", "Author": "moneret", "ReviewID": "UR119364336", "Content": "We stayed at this property for one night at the end of September.

Several small details make this hotel special and more like a bed and breakfast than a hotel.The owners are there all the time and always greet you with a smile. There are fresh flowers set around from their private garden, there are usually homemade cookies put out, breakfast again has fresh baked breads/pastries and a large variety of options to choose from, the rooms are spacious and this is not a large inn, only 22 rooms. There are several room choices. We stayed in the double queen, queen with fireplace and king with fireplace. All great options. There is plenty of room, an extra sitting area, nice closet space and bathrooms with jet tubs.

The walk in closet that was in the room also had another vanity with sink, mirror and hair dryer which made it very nice for 2 people to get ready without crowding each other. The room was very quiet at night and I am not sure what rooms others stayed in but we were no more than 20 feet from the street and never once heard any noise in our room. We faced out into the little courtyard they have there and next to the hot tub which made our nights very relaxing. This hotel is more like a B&B than your average hotel. The owners Tom and Connie knew us on a first name basis and made absolute sure we were having a great stay at their place. Each night they made us reservations at whatever restaurant we were going to which made it nice to not have to deal with that sort of thing on our honeymoon. This was our first trip to Napa and we could not have picked a better place to stay. The location is great, the room was awesome. The owners were unbelievable and the cost was right where we needed to be. When we visit Napa again (and we will) we will for sure be staying at the Elm House Inn again.

Breakfast was simple but a very nice continental buffet with the host offering to prepare a homemade waffle or other item if requested. Oatmeal with all the toppings, toast and grapefruit is pretty much perfect for us, but certainly not what you might expect at a real B&B. The service was also very good- no complaints.

When we arrived in this lovely, cottage style Inn we felt like we were inside a home, with a fireplace stoked and gingerbread smell in the air.

The buffet had fresh baked pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, both hot and cold, yogurt, hardboiled eggs etc. We had waffles one morning.

Bed was okay. There were some little things that irritated me...the door to our room opened right into the lobby, which got pretty noisy in the A.M. when breakfast service began; the single sink drained at a snail's pace (surely housekeeping has noticed a need for Drano when cleaning it); the shower is little more than a curtained off area of the bathroom with a drain...there's no lip to it, so water got all over the bathroom floor when we showered; and the lowest setting for our A/C was pretty high and it would not turn on at all in the evenings. I get hot flashes at night, so that made me rather cranky. :/ On the more positive side, the location was nice for exploring wine country. It's about 3/4 of a mile from the downtown Napa area (a pleasant and safe walk with plenty of sidewalks and streetlights). The inn sits on a fairly high-traffic road, but we were not disturbed by vehicular noise as everything slows way down at night. Breakfast was included, which I would classify as a high-end continental breakfast (no protein other than hard-boiled eggs, but the baked goods, waffles, yogurt parfaits and fruit were top-notch). And again, the staff were super-friendly and accommodating (except for one younger member who didn't show much concern when I inquired about why we couldn't get the A/C to run at night). I liked the free wireless internet, too. The three stars I'm giving Elm House seems a little weak, but four seems too generous. I'd give it about a 3.5 if I could.

The difference between a mid week stay at the best room in the top ranked B&B, and a Friday stay here was about $40. So possibly that is coloring my view somewhat. Considering what some other places wanted for the same time period, the Elm House will always beat them hands down. Everything said in other reviews about the staff is true. They are great. We checked out of our B&B and did not want our wine purchases to sit in the car all day, so we took a chance that our room at the Elm house would be ready. It was! We checked in about 10:00 am.

Check in was simple, and the young female receptionist was friendly, informative and welcoming. Our room was on the first floor. There is a small lift if you have a lot of luggage like we did, but being a small inn you are on your own in moving it, which is fine considering how close your room is.

There was also fresh oj, yogurt parfait., muffins, toast; quite a selection of great food. The gentleman who helped us the next morning was also very friendly.

It was, as someone else described it, more like a boutique hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and cooperative. The room interior was beautiful and the room compared favorably in appointments and cleanliness with the Fairmont in downtown San Francisco (where we stayed the next night) (OK, we really splurged for one night). The foyer and sitting area were truly nice--fireplace, comfy sofas and ottomans and all. The continental breakfast was not the typical crinkly old bananas and dried cereal--instead a nice, but not extravagant, spread (let's put it this way--it was better than the Fairmont's breakfast buffet ($75 for two) and it didn't cost a cent extra). All for about $110 for one night. All in all, this is DEFINITELY a place I'll stay again.

That \"discounted rate\" turned out to be $309 incl. tax In my experience, that doesn't qualify as a discounted rate unless I'm staying at a Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I get that October is high season in the Napa Valley, but really, we're talking about a Best Western here. The room sizes are all over the place; large, small and smaller but the rates don't seem to reflect this. Some have 2 sinks, a pedestal sink in the bathroom and another in the closet. Yes, it's odd, but nice to have the second sink. Some fireplaces, others not. We actually experienced all of the above in our 2 night stay. Pillows were flat and in one of the rooms we stayed, the pillow case had make up stains and the comforter was dirty. Breakfast was OK but the seating area is very limited, so on both days people were standing around holding cereal bowls looking for places to sit. They have one table outside, but it was 52 degrees and no space heater. Room amenties are the standard Best Western issue, so bring your own. The hotel is situated on a very busy street, so there is road noise and dependant where your room is located it can be an issue. Aside from the dirty comforter and pillow case, you can overlook the other issues if the price is right, but not for $309.00.

Since most of the other places in the area were significantly more expensive, I chose the Elm House Inn and booked it over the BW website, using my AAA membership for a discount for a room with two queen beds for myself, my wife and two daughters. The traffic layout for that area of Napa is a bit weird, but after having to make a couple of turns, we got back to the Elm House and checked in. The young man at the desk was very pleasant and helpful. We got a third floor room and found it to be quite clear and well furnished. The only problem we ran into with the room and the Inn as a whole was that it was quite warm. Part of that may be that we'd come from very cool and rainy weather from the Oregon coast through most of the Northern California coast, but we're Northern Floridians and used to heat, so I suspect that the owners may have had the thermostats \"up\" a bit to keep their costs down. The A/C in our room did cool things off a bit, but we found at night (since I was closest to it, I'm the one who had to deal with it!) that it simply would run for a time, then cut off, while the room was stil rather warm. I opened the window, hoping that the cooler air would help, but the traffic noises only managed to keep me awake. Additionally, the comforters on the beds are incredibly thick, adding to the problem. Breakfast in the mornings in the common area on the first floor was very nice and the service was excellent. Yes, they pretty much have the same kind of stuff as a regular BW might have on the road, but it is served and plated much differently. Additionally, the owners fresh bake pasteries and breads and have them on the table, which makes a big difference as well. It was by far the best breakfast experience I've had at a BW or other major chain hotel in quite a while. One review posted recently referred to the rather \"questionable\" nature of the surrounding neighborhood. Well, it isn't exactly downtown Napa or Sonoma, but we never felt threatened, even when I took a wrong turn and found myself in the \"lower rent\" district of town where the folks are the \"help\" in the vineyards, restaurants and shops of the area. Besides, had the Elm House Inn been in a \"better\" neighborhood\" it probably would have been much more expensive. It certainly didn't bother us. It is quite easy to get around from the Elm House Inn to other sights in the area and they are quite good about telling you or even arranging a custom tour for you should you ask to some of the vineyards. My only other complaint about the Elm House was the laundry facilities (such as they are). The sole washing machine and dryer are located outside the Inn through a door to the outside of the Inn that is still covered by a fence. Both machines require ridiculous amounts of change to operate. I though this was a rather tacky addition--though perhaps they do it because of the cost of water in the Napa Valley (I'm trying to be generous). We enjoyed our stay at the Elm House--my two complaints about the temperature and laundry facilities notwithstanding. We got to meet guests from Australia and England because of the breakfast/lobby common area and found everyone to be quite pleasant.

The only caveat I would add (again, not a particularly original one) is that if you're looking for a \"Tuscany in the Napa Valley\" experience (i.e., picturesque inn surrounded by vineyards with mountains in the background) this is a little bit off from that - although very close to the growing charms that Napa (city) provides (e.g., The Bounty Hunter, ZuZu).

To top it all off, homemade belgian waffles with hot syrup. It was all delicious and very filling. Another plus - checkout isn't till noon, so you can relax in your room after a big breakfast before having to pack up and leave. The staff were genuinely nice and caring. One lady even found some aspirin from her own purse for my husband who had a bad headache. They were very helpful in making recommendations for wineries and restaurants as well, and the lobby has a giant book full of menus from nearby restaurants.

Location: Located right off one of Napa's main highways (but not ON the highway -don't worry), Elm House is easily accessible and is a great central spot if you are looking to explore all parts of the Napa region. It's not within walking distance to anything, though, so you'll want to rent a car (but that's pretty standard in Napa - you really do need a car to see the region.) Rooms: We stayed in a king suite, which had a cozy fireplace and bathroom with large jacuzzi tub. It was traditionally decorated, comfortable and quiet. Service: Superb. Friendly, personal service at its best. They helped with everything from scheduling cabs to making dinner reservations to recommending wineries to getting driving directions. We were blown away. Food: The \"continental\" breakfast in the mornings is more like a full-service meal, with the servers offering to toast breads and bringing around fresh-from-the-oven muffins to your table. If you go, you MUST try the homemade belgium waffles. So good. And, every afternoon, you'll find scrumptious cookies with a fresh assortment of coffee, cider and teas. A perfect treat after a day at the wineries. Price: You can't beat the great prices at this hotel! Even the nicest rooms here are way less than the other B&B's in the area.

The rooms have both wireless and Ethernet connections - so we were both able to fire up our laptops and plug into the office. The Elm House is a comfortable 20 minute walk from downtown Napa - along the way you can admire a number of restored Victorians.

It is like Mom is in the kitchen and she just knows when you are there! Whipped butter and warmed syrup just round out the perfect breakfast! YUM! You almost feel like you are in your home with a butler waiting on you. We had a smaller room in the main building with a queen bed and a corner fireplace. The room was small but just fine for two. The fireplace was gas and didn't offer much heat but did give nice ambience on such a cool and rainy weekend. The bathroom was cramped but offers an additonal mirror and sink just outside in the \"closet\" area and there is a fully stocked refrigerator with water, sodas, beer, etc. for a VERY NOMINAL fee. There is also a basket on the desk with snacks that you can purchase for $1-$2 each. NO PRICE GOUGING HERE!!! CONS: The ONLY major complaint I had was the noise from the street. You could hear the cars driving by and the sirens from police and ambulances that passed by. ALSO, minor disappointment in the fan in our bathroom. It was LOUD and made a very scary noise when first turned on. The water pressure had a lot to be desired as well.

I am a travel agent and I have researched and booked many rooms in Napa but this will meet or beat ANY of its competitors on value and cleanliness any day.

There are parking lots on either side of the hotel, so there's always enough room to find a parking place somewhere.

The staff are all very attentive and friendly, and provided lots of useful information regarding the area. The massive file of restaurant menus that they hold proved very useful in deciding our dining options each night, and the internet access in the dining area was a nice bonus. We used the hot tub once, and this was heavenly, a well kept secret. The dining area also doubled as a relaxing rest area where fresh lemonade, iced tea and cookies were provided in the afternoon. It was just like relaxing in someone's lounge. Apparently there is also wine tasting at the weekends (we stayed Mon, Tue and Wed) so remember to time your stay better than us! The only slight downside, and this wasn't the hotel's fault, was the round the clock construction work on the freeway intersection that started just after we arrived. At first we marvelled at the fact that work continued throughout the night to ensure a quick turnaround, but this soon turned to annoyance. Some guests were moved to other hotels, but we stuck it out. The owner did actually go and complain to City Hall and the level of noise did reduce slightly in the evenings.

It appears there are two buildings: the main building and the newer building which houses the \"400\" units. We stayed in the newer building so I don't know if the rooms are the same in the main. We went in the jacuzzi in the mid-afternoon and it was clean (although small) and situated in a lovely courtyard full of hummingbirds feeding on hummingbird feeders.

The continental breakfast was relatively average (I don't know if they were out of this incredible coffee other people raved about) but definitely suited our needs: bagels, english muffins, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, fruit.

We chose, she reserved and on our second night found she had secured us a table at Ristorante Allegria, The building housing this great Italian is an old bank and not only did she secure us a table we were located in the private dining room which is actually the old vault - very atmospheric and enough to make me come over all Butch Cassidy. Our room was in the second building on the ground floor and huge - we upgraded for a little extra but the space was great.

I had to log on to their computer, pull up all my reservations, print them, to prove that i paid for 2 rooms for 6 nights each, because they could not find my reservation thru their paperwork. having already paid 900 for 6 nights, i surely did not want to add another 100 plus. this was very inconveniant for me and my family and i at check out. On july 5th, the fire alarms went off in hotel. i was outside, so i didnt know, but my husband came out later, and said they were going off, and had he not left the rooms, he would not have known, because he could not hear it in the room. he actually thought it was the elevator stuck, because of course they would not work with fire alarms, so he walked down the stairs, still not knowing it was a fire alarm until he got to main level. we still had one of our teenagers in the other room, unaware of any alarm going off, because as i said, u could not hear them. so we had to rush up the stairs, and get her. UNBEILIEVABLE!!!!! come to find out it was just thier boiler room overheating, because no air-conditioning in the kitchen on the 9th floor. room servers were bringing food to people who ordered earlier in the day, complaining it was like 112 in the kitchen, made me sick thinking of sweat all over my food, and these poor people working in those conditions. they did not get the elevators running till like 2 in the morning, so anybody wanting to go back to their rooms had to travel up to 8 floors, using the stairs. there was a poor older lady in lobby with a pacemaker, she couldnt make it that far, her meds were in her room, and rather than give her a different room, and get her things, she was made to sit in the lobby for hours. I got in the hot tub, and a tiny spash of water got in my eyes, and it burned terribly and immediatly, i couldnt even open it for awhile. I own a pool, and its always clean, and never requires chlorination so bad that it burns anybody the way this pool and hot tub did. the breakfast was ok, it was free, but if it did cost, i would not have bought it forsure. the staff and the young man and lady who cleaned our rooms daily were great. the staff at check out on the eighth, were not however, or should i say just the one young lady, who accussed me of not paying and made me look up and print my proof of purchase for this establishment. there are so many nifty mom and pop places aand other places to stay in branson, stay away from this place!!!!!!! Oh yes there is not a vent in bathroom, i read other reviews and the manager said if you hold a tissue to it it sucks the tissue to it......WRONG!!!!!!

It started when we checked in. We were given a double queen room, and we reserved a mini suite. The staff was very apologetic and courteous, and corrected the mistake promptly. The rooms had new beds, new bedding, flat screen tv's, good soap(dial in dispensers, first time I'd seen that) and new drapes. The free breakfast at the top of the hotel was a nice touch. The only two concern's I had was the handicapped parking limitations, and the food variety. I understand keeping costs down while offering something most other hotels don't offer, and that is fabulous. But for a little more variety, like say, putting out all three meats they serve instead of alternating the meats by days, and using better eggs, I would pay ten to fifteen bucks more a night for that. With the handicapped parking issue, I would suggest making more of the top level handicapped(or all of the top level handicapped, since there isn't much parking up there anyway), or maybe adding a valet service. They do offer to park your car for you if you can't climb the mountain that is the rear parking, and that is pretty nice.

The hotel has meeting rooms, suites, a restaurant on the top (9th) floor, indoor pool, exercise room, etc. The hotel sits on a hill, so the entrance into the lobby is on the down-hill side. One must walk up hill from the parkiing lot and/or many steps to enter the lobby. The handicap entrance is on the other side (up-hill side) of the building. Then one must go down one level to the lobby. There are limited handicapped parking spaces on that side of the building. The hotel was probably once a grand hotel, but now is somewhat \"dated\" and needs a face lift. Every place that I had exposure to was clean. The dining area and lounge area on the 9th floor need to be redecorated and up-graded. The complimentary breakfast included hot meat, scrambled eggs, either grits or oatmeal, fried potatoes, waffles, fruit, cereal, buiscits,donuts, sweet rolls, breads, various juices, coffee & cappichino. There was entertainment at breakfast sometimes. All the hotel staff was very polite, helpful, and took care of any problem right away. If you ever stay here, do NOT stay on the 8th floor on the East side. It is right under the kitchen and you can hear all kinds of banging & noises until 10 PM and it begins at again at 5 AM. We asked to be moved after the first night. Also, there was a problem with the fire alarm and as soon as we got settled in our first room, the alarm went off just outside our room and there was an announcement to leave the building via the stairs. It happened that we didn't have to evacuate. The elevators are automaticaly disabled. Someone told us that happened a few days before, and it happened once again on another day while we were in the 9th floor banquet room. All were false alarms, but nonetheless nerve wracking. This is obviously a \"conference\" center or ideal for large groups, but I wouldn't return here as a single customer. There are large crowds trying to use the elevators or dining room all at once.

The pool was awesome but the hot tub - it was a green hugh and the air jets were not working. Pretty gross. But the pool was nice - very warm! Breakfast was okay. It is free so it was packed out - mostly families. The biscuits were a little over-cooked - okay - they could have doubled for hockey pucks. The scrambled eggs were good - the waffles were great. There were 3 kinds of juices, a fruit bar (canned fruit), toast, english muffins, 3 kinds of cereal, hot chocolate and coffee. There was also sausage - my daughter said it was really spicy but okay. We all tried really hard to find things we liked - but the breakfast overall was just medium. The breakfast buffet is on the 9th floor - seemed like an odd place for it - but it works. Funny thing - we did request an extra pillow (an earlier post commented it was a monumental thing to ask for) - no one answered in housekeeping so we called the front desk and were told they ran out of pillows at 3:00 p.m. We made due - but the pillows are small and there are only 2 per bed - so bring your own if you are a pillow person.

I thought the smell was the conference room, perhaps, but I did not see any smokers, and no matter where we went in the building the smell was there. The staff, where ever we encountered them, were not friendly. I am used to a 3 star hotel where every staff person you encounter smiles back at you, and when you say hello, they say hello back to you, from the front desk persons to the gift shop to the housekeepers, etc. This crew all look past you, giving the continued impression that you are not really welcome. There are paper signs taped in the rooms, warning you not steal the towels, and telling you how much it would cost you if you do, and also another little sign telling you that if you smoked in the non smoking room (which already smelled like smoke) it could cost you up to $500. The fitness room is LOCKED, right next to the pool, with another sign that says you have to go to the front desk to get permission to use it. So, we did not go ask for permission, and did not get to use the room that is advertised as one of the amenities. Getting scolded and warned by little paper signs everywhere we went is rather insulting. The funniest part of that is 99% of the other guests are even older than we are, look like mostly in their late 60sor later! So, who are you continuously scolding with your little signs everywhere? Are there rogue seniors who come in and abuse the fitness room and steal hand towels?? LOL. Then, after we had been out in Branson, had a late dinner, then a quick late night swim, we came back up to the room and the electricity went out!! Nothing! No air, no TV, no lights, no housekeeping or maintenance or security crew going around to check on the guests. I am SO glad we had not been on the elevator when the power went out!! We had been in the room for just a minute or two from the pool area when the power outage occurred. We called the front desk, and I understand she was suddenly overwhelmed, but she was unfriendly, and said \"Ma'am, all of Branson is out! It's dark everywhere!\" But looking out our window from the 8th floor, I could clearly see that was not true!! It was very difficult to try to manuever around the room using a cell phone for light, then to try to fall asleep...... once I did finally get to sleep, at 3 am everything came back on, so all of a sudden the lights and fan came to life, pulling me from a sleep I had just found! Then, was hard to go back to sleep again! The breakfast buffet in the morning was very nice, though we were tired and grumpy from the weird night. The pool was perfect temperature, and we had it to ourselves, which is always relaxing when that happens. The hot tub was also nice. Upon returning home, I see an email alert from our bank that a $20 charge was processed from the hotel, 'for incidentals'. I understand the whole \"hold\" thing on your account when you book a room, etc., but we paid for this ahead of time, and although we are assured that the $20 charge will be credited back early in the week, it is still just like another one of their little paper signs telling you not to steal things.... it was not a total disaster, but we will not stay there again!", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cThere is better\u201d", "Author": "jenby", "ReviewID": "UR54288233", "Content": "We've stayed here for the past 4 years and each year it's gets worse.

We had a decent stay at the Grand Plaza Hotel. It was clean and the service was above average. The Grand Plaza offers a nice continental breakfast. We expected only a few tid bits but it included a spread with pastries, cereal, hard boiled eggs, bagels, toast, fruit, etc... (A little above average for this type of hotel) The pool was an average size for the Branson area and it was indoor. Our kids are 11 and 14 and they enjoyed it. We paid $69 per night for a room with an internet coupon which we thought was an excellent value. There were 2 double beds so the four of us shared. Overall, I would say this is probably is one of the best hotels we have stayed in and I am extremely fussy! Perhaps not the most luxiourous hotel but if you want an average hotel at a decent price this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5147293", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in the Grand Plaza Hotel around the 2nd week of December.

We had a family suite (Room 417) and it was clean and neat. I was concerned that being next to the mechanical room and elevator would be too noisy. It was very quiet though. The parking lot is steep. You check in at the lower level and then can park around top at the first floor entrance which is not steep. The continental breakfast provided was perfect. They had fruit, yogurt, donuts, bagels, toast, oatmeal, cereal, hard boiled eggs, juice and coffee. It was perfect to start the day. The heated pool was nice. Not too warm. The hot tub was nice and hot but needed to be slightly cleaned. The only complaints I have is that after swimming on Sunday morning I returned to my room in my bathing suit and my key would not work. I went to the front desk and the front desk clerk indicated that the keys are deactivated one hour before checkout (11:00 a.m.) and they are trying to get that changed. I also requested a late check out of 12:00 p.m. to a woman at the front desk. She said that's fine. Then I received a telephone call at 11:30 a.m. from someone asking for housekeeping. I told her this wasn't housekeeping and she indicated she was checking if we would be staying another day. I told her that I had called and spoke with a woman and asked for a late checkout. Small lack of communication. I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2616693", "Content": "This hotel was just Ok, by far not the worst hotel, but by far not the best either.

But it was only an extra $15.00 a night. The room wasn't the cleanest, there was a water bottle lid left on the floor and tape all over the ceiling. Overall it was a nice hotel, I am sure it is nicer than most of the hotels in Branson. The Grand Plaza View Restaurant ran out of food on the Saturday night of of stay, and the bar ran out of most of their liquor. This was a is a disappointment. the staff at the restaurant were drinking and smoking while they were working.

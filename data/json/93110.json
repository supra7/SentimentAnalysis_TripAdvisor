We found a great rate for this hotel with parksleepfly. It included a one-night stay and parking for six nights, saving us a bundle on cruise-port parking. We booked during the first weekend of Jazz Fest, so hotels surrounding New Orleans were high-priced and fully booked.The hotel offered well-lit, fenced-off, secured parking, and we were very pleased.The staff was pleasant, informative, and our room was quiet, clean, and comfortable. We enjoyed the continental breakfast, and even though we arrived a few minutes late, the hostess was sweet and brought us extra muffins! It was the perfect send-off to our cruise.The Westbank area is a great secret for New Orleans travelers. It's a short trip across the bridge to all that's happening, but the hotel area is filled with shops and restaurants as well. The rates tend to be cheaper in this area, but it's still as convenient as can be. Our taxi ride from the hotel to the pier, adjacent to the French Quarter, cost $9.50 for two.If you're looking for comfortable, middle-of-the-road accomodations in a great, convenient, reasonably-priced New Orleans suburb, don't hesitate to book La Quinta Westbank. It's an especially good choice for those driving to the Port of New Orleans for a pre-cruise stay that includes parking!", "Date": "May 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR247570312", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "HEINOUS!!! This hotel was absolutely horrific. If you want to be on the Jerry Spring show, this might be a good pick for you. There were dead and live bugs in our room, as well as strands of hair in various places. I called the front desk for a clean blanket (the one on my bed seemed dirty and smelled odd--don't get me started on the comforter), and I was told that they didn't have any. My friend pointed out that perhaps the reason they didn't have any extra blankets was because they don't bother to clean the ones that are already on the beds. I had to go to a store to buy a new blanket, just because I was so disgusted by the situation. The room was incredibly noisy and in the mornings you can forget about sleeping in. The housekeeping employees yell from room to room and have absolutely no regard for the guests. One night we were lying in bed and we thought we heard someone singing. We peaked out of our window and noticed a shirtless male drinking beer, listening to headphones, and singing along. He was sitting directly in front of our room, so we called the front desk and requested security assistance. We waited for AN HOUR and nobody had shown up. The guy was still sitting out there and kept going back to his car to bring back more beer. Being two single, young females, we were very disturbed by this. We called the front desk again and said that security had never stopped by, and we were told that they didn't want to scare the other guests in the lobby by alerting security to the situation. RIDICULOUS!! The guy finally left, before any security officer made an appearance. This hotel was in a horrible neighborhood and the parking lot seemed very unsafe. There were no restaurants nearby and people seemed to be just hanging out in random parking lots. Overall, this was a TERRIBLE hotel and nobody should ever stay there!", "Date": "May 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR623831841", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Stay Away!

We were looking for a motel that allowed dogs, and that was reasonably priced. We stayed 3 nights and paid $207. We stayed in room 206-it was spotless . The beds were comfortable, and the linens were clean and smelled fresh . I thought that maybe being a dog friendly motel, that there would be doggie odors in the room, but suprisingly not! Though we saw a few dogs being walked around the parking lot, we never heard any barking. The rooms were very quiet. We walked over to the mall in the evening. I remembered reading in the reviews about security issues in the area, and noticed that there was a security car driving around the mall parking lot. The hotel parking lot was well lit and I felt very secure. It's a straight shot over the Toll bridge ($1-only one way) to the French Quarter, also a quick shot to Loyola where our daughter is attending. (about 8 mins).

Upon our arrival, my family of 6 (including 2 teenage daughters) was assigned to 2 rooms that were in disastrous condition. There was food on the wall in one room, exposed nails sticking out of the wall in another, heavily stained mattresses and box springs, nonworking heat/air conditioning units, and strong smells of smoke and other odors. My family would not stay at the hotel and I asked the female manager on site to reverse the reservation, and she agreed. It was later explained to me that we were mistakenly shown rooms given to 'weekly' rental customers who naturally trash the rooms. Now, who would send a family to such rooms? I received a 'bill information printout' showing what I hoped was a reversal of the charges made to my credit card and assurances that I would not be charged, but sure enough the charges have shown up and I cannot get a reply from the hotel yet. I'm in for a battle just to get money back for 2 rooms that we NEVER USED.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Benton, IL", "Title": "\u201cWe ended up going to another hotel after one night..\u201d", "Author": "Mark B", "ReviewID": "UR123941965", "Content": "The other reviewers are telling the truth, the hotel is currently \"under renovation\". However, it is no excuse for the room we had. We used the website to book our room. The photos shown are when the hotel was in it's \"heyday\". Not now. We checked in on 23-Jan-12. Expected Check out 29-Jan-12. Actual checkout: 24-Jan-12. The room that we had was supposed to be a \"suite\" with a full size fridge, stove top, and a microwave. The room they had for us was just a generic hotel room with none of the above amenities. We went to the front desk and asked for the room we were promised. The girl at the front said that housekeeping went home for the day and there was nothing they could do until tomorrow. We pushed that we needed a fridge (for medical reasons) and they relocated us to room 161. It was the same room, but more cramped with a microwave that was broken, (when you closed the door, it just started going, timer didn't work) a matress that was 1/2 off the bed, cigarette butts, wrappers and other debris around the bed. We were tired and just wanted to take a shower. I went in the bathroom and turned the light on, the vent fan was broken and nasty stuff was hanging out of it. I turned on the shower, then got in. The actual bathtub faucet was not secured in any way and 1/2 way through my shower, it shot off and nailed me in the shin! (I actually got a black and blue mark from it the size of a 1/2 dollar). We promptly checked out and went back to the other hotel that we stayed at. It was more expensive, but worth it. I might actually try the place again after a remodel, but they need to do A LOT of work. Other info: Excercise Room? Defunct. Business Center: Out of Date. 2 computers, both with 14\" CRT screens. slow! Pool: OK, Shows it's age more than displayed picture Ballrooms: Currently under remodel, look OK with the new carpeting they were laying Attached Resturant: Was a Bennigans. Seen better days.

Oh on weekend, they open up the dance floor for everyone. Yeah, booze, sport and dance; not to mention good foods. You can't go wrong with that. The owners are very friendly so are the people who work there. It can't get better than this in my opinion. For $49 or $59 per night, you get 4 star treatment.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What an experience!! Unfortunately, we chose to stay here!! Booked for one night as we arrived Phoenix late after a trans Atlantic flight. Arrived at the hotel at about 9.00 pm, exhausted and checked in. Once in the room the door could only be locked from the inside but not the outside so you could not leave the room with your stuff in it! Also it would appear the door had been kicked in as it was broken from the lock to the bottom (luckily the lock did hold!) and there was a hole in the door. We checked to see if the sheets, towels and bathroom were clean - they were so we stayed. Woke early the next day and left. There is a great place just up the road (we drove) for breakfast! Would not stay here again or recommend it. We did hope the other hotels we had booked for the next 3 weeks would be better! They were! Quite an experience. P.S. The photo of the hotel is very accurate - it does look lovely from the outside!", "Date": "Jun 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR280765723", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Hell On Earth This is the WORST place i have EVER stayed, nothing even comes close. The place is home to the largest population of 50 cent wannabes in the USA. The rooms have pubes all over the floor, brown stains on the sofa and no soap. Next door is a strip club, outside are prostitues, there is a gym (1 bumbell actually). The fact that this hotel is on a big wall in the airport with the best local hotels is embarrasing for phoenix, the fact that i actually stayed the place for 7 hours is testement to my resilience (or maybe my stupidity). I asked the receptionist if there is anywhere i could walk to get some food, she looked at me is if i was MENTAL. I would only return to this motel if i had an entourage of 5 Range Rovers all bullet proof filled with Ex Russian bodygaurds, armed with AK47's., Even then the motel would have to have been taken over by RITZ. PLEASE DONT EVEN CONSIDER STAYING HERE FOR ONE MINUTE, unless you are infact a 50pence wannanbe. THIS IS NOT A HOTEL OF WESTERN STANDARDS. DO NOT CONTEMPLATE IT. stay in a local park, in a box rented from wal-mart or simplyspend an extra $40 and stay somewhere proper. ALWAYS USE WINGATES, U CANT FAIL.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR296687655", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "emdee"}, {"Content": "Stay at the airport instead... it will be a better experience I was dumped here when my flight was cancelled and Delta could not find any other accomodations anywhere near the airport. Actually accomodations is a generous term for this place. If I had it to do over, I would have just camped out at the airport.Bugs in the bathroom, one bare light bulb with plastic melted on it, prostitutes walking up and down the street, one of the few places I've ever stayed that genuinely made me feel uncomfortable. On the way back from a short trip down the street to find food, I was asked by someone standing in the shadows right next to the hotel if I could spare $100. I could go on about the joke this place is but I wasted 8 hours of my life here already and that is enough!Note, after getting back from the trip, I looked this place up on TripAdvisor and I could have sworn there were about 6 very negative reviews. As I write this though I only see one (I waited a few months before submitting this review).", "Date": "Jul 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR161522633", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "the_griswalds"}, {"Content": "You call this a hotel!!??? Any agency who allows booking for this hotel should have to STAY at this DUMP!! Sure, the price was low. Internet bargains are supposed to be low. But this place sets the standards for sometimes you don't even get what you pay for. They probably pay their staff below minimum wage. We booked on line for a two-bed room for two adults and two kids. This means our room was paid for. We arrive around 3 a.m. and they had already given our room away. Then they said they had a room with one bed that we could use. This room had NO PILLOWS, NO TOILET PAPER, NO T.V.. a piece of paper towel in the door lock which had been reomoved and an extra table that they obviously had no place to store. At this time of the morning, with kids in tow, who has time to shop around, especially when you've already paid your hotel/motel/dump. Needless to say, we would NEVER book here again. Thanks to trip advisor, you won't either. 03/05", "Date": "Mar 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR586086843", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d73910-r5331666-Travel_Inn_Airport-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "73910", "Price": "$70"}}

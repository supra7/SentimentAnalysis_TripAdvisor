When I walked into the room, I was immediately impressed by the stunning view of the city and the simple yet quaint decor of the room. It was simply perfect - I couldn't have imagined a better room, nor a more fabulous location! But I have to say, what has impressed me so much about this hotel, day in and day out, is the attention to detail and the little touches they offer their guests, such as the complimentary breakfast, which is incredible, and the complimentary wine and cheese each night, the daily delicious cookies placed in the room and just a real friendly, wanting to please, staff. Oh and as a side note, coming from NYC, I was nervous the hotel location was going to be too quiet and that I would have trouble sleeping, luckily for me, they have an awesome sound machine that has helped put me to sleep every night! I have to travel downtown every day for work, and coming back here is like a breath of fresh air.

It is understated and elegant, with wonderful service. It is boutique in the true sense of the word. This is not a hotel for people who want spas and extensive room service, but it is a great hotel for those who like a comfortable, quite beautiful place to relax in while staying in SF. My husband and my six year old son went up to stay a couple of days before thanksgiving to show our son the sights and sounds of this lovely city and we couldn't have had a better time. The Hotel is situated on tippy top of Pacific Heights, one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in SF.We arrived at night quite late tired from our travels, to be told that we had been up graded to a corner suite! Our room on the 4th floor was simply elegant, I think originally this hotel used to be a boarding house back in the day so the rooms are quite substantial. When we woke up in the morning we were greeted by the most beautiful views of San Francisco. The decor of the rooms and hotel is gorgeous, simple and understated and in keeping with the turn of the century architecture. I think a lot of hotels when they say free continental breakfast will have cereal and a few croissants maybe, The continental breakfast at Hotel Drisco, which is served in a beautiful breakfast room, is what a real continental breakfast should be. Beautiful fresh pastries, fresh fruit, porridge, cheeses, bagels, yoghurts. I was delicious! They also have wine tasting in the evening in the sitting room, but we never managed to get to it. From the hotel you can walk to a lot of the best places in SF; the first day we walked down one side of the hill to the Academy of Science (well worth a visit) in Golden Gate Park, and stopped at a great playground on the way called Rossi playground ( on Arguello blvd and Anza street), after the science academy went across and had a cup of tea at the Japanese Tea Garden ( lovely!). The second day we went down the other side of the hill to the Palais of Fine Arts. Both walks were through some of the prettiest streets in SF, the architecture in this neighborhood is beautiful, and it is very enjoyable just to meander down these streets catching views of the Golden Gate Bridge as you make your way down. You can also walk to a lot of great restaurants (might want to get a taxi back though as it is up hill all the way!).

When booking this hotel I would be careful to be realistic about expectations regarding location and what to expect in this hotel class category.

The hotel is set in the elegant (but hilly) Pacific Heights area and although you can walk to Union Square (as we did) my recommendation would be to get a cab it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a bit beyond comfortable walking distance. As other reviews mentioned, experience the early evening wine tasting and that great healthy breakfast. I would like to give a mention to Julio, Ann and Raisa who managed these sessions, and without their attention our stay would not nearly have been so complete. Joie de Vivre Management should take note of the contributions of these individuals as they are a real asset to your organisation.

First, the process of checking in was so simple - I just said my name and they were already waiting for me - I didn't have to fill out any forms; I was in my room within a minute of walking inside the hotel. Then the hotel itself: it is very small compared to your average Hilton, and there is this great feeling of being a guest in somebody's private home. The decor is well thought through: comfortable and with great touches like window boxes on the floor looking out onto the street, where you just want to sit all day. The bathrobe was really comfy and the toiletries were great. Everything looked customized to the hotel, and the hotel seems to care a lot about using local products (foods, etc.). Also as a great leg up on the big chains, the WiFi and breakfast were complimentary - you just don't get that at hotels anymore, and I think it doesn't make any sense to pay $300+ for a room and be charged $20 for Internet as if it is some sort of crazy person's extra need. The breakfast was perfect: selection small enough to be able to choose from and not feel lost, and every single thing I had was the way it is supposed to be: fresh baguette, good butter, a great selection of jams and meats, and freshly squeezed orange juice. Just what the doctor ordered. The staff were very nice and corteous as well. And of course, I don't think you can quite beat the location: it's right in the middle of Pacific Heights with all the charm of San Francisco right there.

It was very nicely appointed with comfortable pillows and high-grade sheeting. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful! Hard cooked eggs, hot fresh (not instant) oatmeal, lots of pastries and bagels, a huge assortment of jams and other spreads (nutella, etc.) and meats as well as cheeses. I especially loved the local granola, which I had with yogurt (again, a nice selection-goat, cow, with and without fruit) and additional dried fruits. You can serve yourself their robust coffee, or order an espresso or cappuccino. The location of our room (208-both nights) had a vast view overlooking the city, because the hotel sits at the top of the hill. This location is a huge plus. Not only is it quiet, but within a stones throw are some of the most beautiful and extravagant homes you will ever see! Be sure to walk one block north to Broadway, and take in all these residences. Find the one with the outside goldfish bowl and tiered waterfalls....(the owner informed us as we were taking photos there are more pools with fish along the steps up to the front door) then continue west to the end of the block, where the steeply tiered steps (and there are many...as well as lots of athletes doing their runs up and down them) lead you along the mature stand of Eucalyptus trees in the park within the Presidio.

This hotel is located in a beautiful and quiet residential neighborhood. At first, we were concerned about possible parking issues, but were assured this wouldn't be an problem. It wasn't! We never had one problem finding a parking spot and were told, if a problem occurred, they would help us find one. One of the employees even offered his own personal parking spot. We arrived early and decided to see if we could check in. We were met at the door by an employee, Bob, who instantly got us an available room and spent the next 20 minutes showing us the hotel, recommending places to visit, eat, what tours to take, etc. Every recommendation was awesome! Bob also told us about the wine and cheese reception every night and the breakfast they offer daily included in our stay. Our room was very clean and beautiful, overlooking the million dollar houses that surrounded us. The bed was heavenly and the bottled water and chocolate shortbread cookies they offer with their turndown service was a nice touch! The wine and cheese reception was wonderful and the general manager personally greeted everyone who attended, ensuring everyone was satisfied with their stay. The morning breakfast was no different. Breakfast included oatmeal, fresh pastries, fruit, bagels and toast with every topping imaginable, fruit juice, tea, coffee or specially made lattes, mochas, and cappuccinos. It was fabulous! Again, the general manager was there greeting all the guests. There was also a sitting room that had complimentary citrus water, coffee and tea off the front lobby. It was the personal service that was the best part of this stay. The entire staff couldn't do enough for you and everyone was always pleasant and happy to speak with.

I booked a Deluxe King in this hotel as a treat for the last part of my first holiday with my partner in three years, to end it in a nice environment/neighborhood and to be looked after by what seemed like a service-oriented hotel in a fabulous part of town. The hotel was booked 9 months in advance, and I made a special note for a quiet room, and a nice one if at all possible, as we regarded our holiday as a very special occassion (my partner proposed) and we wanted it to be as beautiful as possible. Service-wise, the person that carried our luggage was most attentive and nice-bravo. The hotel room had little touches that were cute-like the notecard with tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local weather forecast. That's where the good stuff end. In terms of decor we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at all impressed-as English people who have visited a B&B or two, the room decor was just like a British \u00c2\u00a340-a-room-a-night B&B, only charged multiple times as much. For Americans who are used to the box-standard Marriots this might seem lovely, but for experienced travelers who know \"character\", the idea that this is a 4.5 star hotel is laughable-though I wasn't laughing. Room 201 was really small and stuffy. We would bear that if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the noise. The building is old and everything creaks. Everything. You can hear people opening doors, people closing doors, people walking outside your room, walking above your room, walking down the stairs, watching TV, moving their suitcases about, babies crying in the next room. The receptionist initially dismissed my request for a quieter room, telling us that no one had ever complained about noise before (really??). But upon enquiring about early-checkout conditions, he became more accommodating. A couple of hours later the man who had carried our luggage, confirmed that our room will be changed to something \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bigger and a little quieter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which we felt most grateful for because I was very upset. We just had to stay for one night in our current room before moving. But after waking up at 5.45am from the thumping and creaking of early risers, I felt that as the building is so old changing rooms would not have made much of a difference. The room they offered to move us to was one by the coffee lounge and next to the public toilet. With these paper thin walls I decided not to take any chances, there were three days left of holiday and I wanted to be happy! May I also add that there was scaffolding outside our window and a notice apologising for any noise whilst they did works to the hotel from 10am-5pm. We simply resented paying our hard-earned money for a substandard experience. By 8am we were gone. It seems if I had booked a suite I would have had a much nicer experience but fortunately I will never find out.

The hotel has a lounge where you can get tea and coffee 24/7 and home made biscotti in the afternoons. The breakfast was included and was a nice buffet with plenty of options. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city - but especially if you are looking for some quirky charm and tradition.

Note that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve rated it five stars, but that does not mean it was perfect in every way. Frankly, the full 5-star rating is for the service provided and not the hotel per se. Without a doubt, the service my wife and I received was superb down to the very last person, and I mean everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c door man, housekeeping, maintenance, kitchen staff, front desk, you name it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c insanely friendly, helpful, and courteous (and a special thank you to Victor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thank you so much). That said, the hotel itself was not what I expected. I say that not because it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a nice hotel, but because the photos you see online don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell the complete picture. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also not suggesting they are misleading, but in total, I don't think they provide a full visual description of the environment. Below are a few examples, with the understanding I mean these to be observations (not criticisms) so you have a fuller understanding of what to expect than I did. 1. The hotel is in a beautiful upscale residential neighborhood. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re surrounded by houses (many of which are mansions) and no commerce. This can be good or bad, depending on how you see it. In one sense, you feel like a resident of the city (good, IMO); on the other, you have no access to basic amenities (snacks, pharmaceuticals, etc) outside what the hotel provides (not so good). 2. You are literally at the peak of a hill, which, depending on your room, can provide you a spectacular view of either the city or Alcatraz/Golden Gate Bridge. The potential downside, of course, is that you walk up/down very steep hills in all four directions. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using public transportation, be prepared for very steep climbs on return trips because the bus system is one block over and one block down from the hotel. One block over and down doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like a big deal until you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve trekked up and down it several times in a day over a period of days. Bottom line, the hotel is probably not ideal for folks who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comfortable climbing very steep hills regularly but would like to use public transportation as their primary means of transportation during their stay. 3. The hotel is old. Beautiful old building and well maintained (functional, clean), but all the wood floors creak, many areas of the hotel have very uneven flooring, the hallway carpeting is worn down, the room windows are old and difficult to open/close, etc. Again, not a criticism, just an observation. I make this observation because the photos I saw of the rooms gave me the impression HD is a very modern hotel. Simply not the case. It seems more like a remodeled house that tried to retain its original flair. Probably better to think of it like a very large, charming New England B&B than a modern hotel. Depending on your travel habits and hotel preferences, this style may or may not suit you. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more accustomed to (and prefer) business hotels, I would suggest the Hotel Nikko downtown. Although it borders what looks to be a marginal area of town, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 100% safe and in a really convenient location for getting around. On the other hand, if you like hotels with character and old-world charm, then I think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll love many aspects of the Hotel Drisco. 4. As for the room itself, great mattress and bedding. A hotel for me above all else is for getting a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep, and no issues there. Couple of annoyances, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Internet connection worked only intermittently and the front desk seemed unable to sort it out. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend a great deal of time on the Internet when traveling, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to send an email, find a good restaurant on Yelp, or get bus routes from the hotel to a point in the city (511.org), it gets annoying quickly when you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get Internet access as advertised. Another small but relatively annoying thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re issued a room key and minibar key on a keychain. Again, maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old-world charm, but I find it annoying. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always carry a backpack or other bag, especially when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m out exploring, so it annoyed me I had to carry keys in my front pocket. Would much rather have had a room card that fits in my wallet. Again, though, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just my preference. 5. Other points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c limited but good breakfast in the morning: oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, bagels, pastries, croissants, juices, cereals. Pretty standard fare, but good way to start the day. Apples in the lobby, water upon request, and a wine tasting each evening add to the charm and appeal. In sum, the service at Hotel Drisco was superb, but the physical experience was different than I had originally imagined it would be. Neither bad nor good, just different than my expectations.

My boyfriend and I were staying with family in Pacifica on holiday from the uk and only had a couple of nights in the city. We had stayed at Parc 55 the first night and Hotel Drisco was our second and final night in the city. The hotel itself is in Pacific Heights which is a considearable distance from any cable car stops, the civic centre, the wharf or union square; basically it was quite out of the way. The hotel is beautifully appointed though and the staff were great. The lady on reception told us about the Lyon street stairway which we ended up walking down and actually all the way to pier 39 from there and it was a great walk. In the evening we wanted to go for some dinner, there were a few places in walking distance but we decided to venture to union street as the giants were playing in the world series. It was another big walk to get to all of the bars and another taxi back to the hotel. Our room was pleasant but they had situated us on the ground floor right next to the dining room which we didn't like but as we were only there for 1 night I didn't say anything. The room was lovely and clean and at one point a lady came round offering us cookies and ice! Nice touch!

No, they don't have all the amenities that a typical modern hotel might have. And no, there is not a hot-spot bar on the ground floor. And the floors creak a bit. And the elevator is small. And the temperature in the room is occasionally a bit difficult to control. But the wood is lovingly polished. The front stairs are swept hourly by the incredibly polite doorman, Than. The front desk staff is mind-bendingly pleasant. The breakfast is delicious and simple, served in a room that one could imagine would be frequented by the British aristocracy, looking for a quiet place to nosh. In short, the overall experience is so damn satisfying that the hotel's few quirks (and don't get me wrong - there are some!) , far from being inconveniences, are actually additive to the experience.

Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.\u201d", "Author": "ChristinaHegele", "ReviewID": "UR75573991", "Content": "What a great place. Difficult to write about, because you want to do it justice. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go through all my regular categories, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just so much more to it than solely cleanliness, food, room size and the other usual suspects. Alright, here we go: Room: Our queen bedroom was quite big, and our window faced the tiny interior courtyard. Sure, the view towards the Golden Gate Bridge would have been nicer, but we knew we had booked a budget special, so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect marvelous views either. And to be honest, the nice little courtyard made it a very quiet option. The room looked just like we had imagined it from pictures on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website; a beautifully decorated room with excellent furniture and nice unique touches. We had the most comfortable, soft bathrobes, a big TV with all the channels one could possibly want, and our bathroom was fantastic both in terms of decor and size. Location: We loved staying in Pacific Heights, and we found it a really good alternative to staying in the city center. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely neighborhood, quite affluent, with beautiful homes, and the hotel is not far away from the shops and restaurants of Fillmore Street. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long to go the city center by bus or taxi either and we felt by staying there we got to see more than just the tourism and business centers of San Francisco. Atmosphere and service: These two go hand in hand in this hotel. The Drisco is certainly not a big anonymous chain hotel. Instead, it is friendly, more homely, welcoming and makes an effort to properly host you. We received a very warm welcome from all staff we encountered. It was always really nice to talk to the employees, from cleaner to waiter to concierge. We had a very friendly chat with the front desk when we asked for bars and clubs to go out on the weekend, and we were recommended exactly the right spots for our age group and taste in music and crowd. The cleaning lady was so mindful and always greeted us with a kind smile, and that just made for a really nice start to the day. Service is written big in this hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just another corporate culture value system that staff has to internalize only to forget it on their first day of work. It is omnipresent and alive and kicking! All in all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say Chip Conley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s philosophy for his Joie de Vivre hotels really comes through at the Drisco - \"celebrating the joy of life\" surely comes naturally there. I almost forgot to mention the complimentary cheese and wine tasting in the afternoon... And yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spick and span, everywhere. If San Francisco wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t such a beautiful city, I would have been tempted to stay in the hotel all day. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to stay at Drisco again, should I ever be fortunate enough to revisit San Francisco.

I wasn't expecting such an old building though. I loved it for the charm, but you definitely hear people in the room above you walking around when the wood floors creek. The same with hallways - they creek loud and since the walls are thin it can easily wake you up. The beds were so comfortable though that it really didn't bother us... but I heard other guests complaining about the noise. The plumming was noisy. You could hear when anyone in a room near you turned on the shower as the walls are thin and pipes run through them. This DID NOT take away from the hotel for us. It didn't bother us and wasn't a bother... but at the price of the rooms I'm sure it would bother some. It's very very nice, offers a good breakfast with more than just pastries and coffee (fruits, cereals, breads/grains, jams, meats, cheeses, juices, etc.), and the beds and rooms are simply cozy. The amenities are great - honor bar (mini fridge where it's on your honor to tell them if you take something from it), nice HDTV with dvd player built in, free tour of your choice (not our style but nice to have it offered), comfortable beds, very nice bathrooms, bathrobes, and the list goes on. I recommend booking online through their website. it's very easy and you can actually find a better rate (deals with AAA, etc. that you can't get on a booking site). This hotel was sold out for our nights there so you should book months ahead if you can. Some ritzy snobby people stay at this hotel... I felt bad for the guy carrying this woman's luggage ordering him around where on the steps and outside she wanted each of her 7 bags for her 3 night stay. We don't fit in with that crowd, but in the dining room for breakfast felt like those were not the majority of people there. Even the staff made jokes about some of the rude guests - ha. This hotel was a splurge for us and if I'm lucky enough to get to do it again I will. The location can't be beat. It's only $10-$15 by cab to the majority of places you'll want to go... and less than that for many others. We chose to walk (yes up those hills) and didn't have much trouble.

Hotel Drisco is located in the exclusive Pacific Heights neighborhood and is surrounded by beautiful and interesting homes. It is away from the hubub of Union Square so it gives a much more authentic San Francisco local \"feel.\" You can take a wonderful walk or run by just stepping out the door! Here are some of the other positives of this hotel. First, you can park a car right at the property. No parking fees, no valet, no hassle. Breakfast is included with your room, so you're not having to spend $$$ in the morning. Coffee is always available in the living room and a wine and cheese hour is available each evening. Julio, our gracious wine hour host, is an amazing resource for offering suggestions for fabulous local eateries. Each place he recommended was fabulous and relatively inexpensive. The room is very comfortable and nicely appointed and includes free internet access. However, our room was on one of the lowest floors with absolutely no view. That was the only drawback.

It does seem odd that there are so many rave reviews and so many negative reviews. Unfortunately, my experience there fell into the negative review camp. I stayed in room 302. This room faces a light well, the view being into windows of other rooms and and adjacent apartment building. There is no ventilation in this room and it is thus airless and stuffy. The only way to get air is to open the windows. In doing so, you are now subject to non-stop noise from other rooms, i.e. cell phones ringing/being answered at all hours, sexual relations, conversations, baby crying, toilets flushing, TV, etc. The roller shade on the window was non-functional so light coming into the room was an issue all night. Air quality - around 4 a.m. fetid odors of burning food filled the room and were still present when I checked out at 9 a.m. All of this made for a miserable night and a less than refreshed sense of being for the work day ahead. I am reading a lot of \"you should have told us\" from the management responses to reviews in this forum. What is it that you could remedy in my list of issues above other than perhaps fix the window shade? When one has retired for the evening, there is no interest in taking on issues that cannot be remedied and should not exist in a quality hotel. I would imagine that if you are in an upper floor suite with and outward facing view, the stay here would be pleasurable. Management needs to come clean on the reality of their rooms, i.e. rooms facing a light well, no attached bath, etc. in their online descriptions and let the customer decide if these limitations are worth the price. In my opinion, they are not and as I would not put up with this again, I cannot recommend this hotel to others. The responses I am reading in this forum from Hotel Drisco management are somewhat troubling. While trying to appear customer service oriented, there is a lot of glossing over of the real issues (as listed above and from others) with a not so thinly veiled blame the customer attitude.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Lanarkshire", "Title": "\u201cClassy\u201d", "Author": "MDM2401", "ReviewID": "UR45728984", "Content": "We arrived at the Drisco, late in the evening after a long drive, just as the weather turned sour - however as soon as we got inside our mood improved.

The complimentary breakfast was a great way to start the day, with cereal, fruit, toast, boiled eggs, croissants and the usual juice, coffee, tea. They had a complimentary town car service that would drop you to either Union Square or the Financial District in the morning. We found this very convenient. We got multi day muni passes, which were very economical and very well used. We would definitely recommend getting these, which you can purchase at the front desk of the hotel. We actually loved that this hotel was not in the usual, touristy areas. Not only does it get you away from the hustle and bustle of those spots, but it also allows you to see a part of the city that you may not normally see. Also, the town car service in the morning and the MUNI service will effectively get you to and from the hotel when needed. There are lots of great restaurants within the area, all of which seem to be much more local and much less touristy - which we liked. The hotel does not have a parking lot, but there is lots of parking on the streets around the hotel. During the week there is a three hour limit on parking, but we just left our keys with the front desk in the morning and they took care of making sure our car was moved when it needed to be so that we didn't get a ticket.

We didn't have much time to plan about our tirp before we went there, but the first day we got there, the staff showed our room explained about the city and recommended places to go and that helped out a lot. Very small details about their service impressed us. Paking around the hotel wasn't hard at all and we didn't pay anything for parking(compare to the hotels in downtowny that you need to pay about $40-50 for parking per day, it wonderful). Free internet access was pleasant as well. Iron board, iron that they had in the roon were clean, too(it doesnt happen with every hotel in my experience).

From the moment I checked in until a departed (unfortunately, a mere 24 hours later) I was made to feel like a truly treasured guest. Specifically, upon check in I was upgrade to a phenomenal suite (room 103) that felt more like a private apartment than a room in a hotel. Also, when I pulled up to the hotel in my rental car, I parked in the temporary loading zone as directed. When I came back out to move my car, I found that I had been inadvertently boxed in by a tow truck that was picking up a vehicle to be serviced from a nearby home. The owner of the car and the tow truck driver both apologized and said that they would do their best to hurry, but of course you can't really rush something as important as strapping a 2 ton vehicle to the back of a tow truck! When the bellman stepped out of the lobby and saw that I was waiting, he offered to wait and then park my car for me, and then bring the keys back to my room! Talk about service! The hotel itself is located in historic Pacific Heights, with gorgeous views of the bay amid dramatic victorian homes. If you are concerned about being far from the traditional tourist spots (Embarcadero, Union Square, etc...) don't be - SF is not a very large city and cabs are both plentiful and affordable. Besides, this neighborhood is truly the most beautiful and unique. As mentioned above, I was only in town for one night and as such, was a little worn out from the hectic travel schedule. Hotel Drisco provided the perfect opportunity to relax: after I checked in I was able to enjoy the complementary wine and cheese reception downstairs from 5:00-6:30. Also, I was able to relax in the comfortable sitting room facing the main road in front while waiting for my dinner guests to pick me up. Also, in the morning there is a delicious breakfast buffet served (included in the price of the room) and I was even able to purchase a panini sandwich to go, as I was going to be on the road for the day.

We only had to wait 3 or 4 minutes at most. It was not difficult to get around by bus at all, and actually gave us a good tour of the neighborhood. Pacific Heights is a quaint and picturesque area with gorgeous homes. Lovely to walk around. Upon leaving the hotel, the staff are quite happy to arrange a town car to take you to the airport - comparable to the cost of a taxi, but much more luxurious. We would stay here again.

We found the basic room a bit tight so when we stay there again (which we most definitely will!) we would book a suite.

We were able to get a cheaper rate after joining the JDV members club. This was our first trip to San Francisco and we stayed for a week. I found the reception staff to be very polite and helpful - always greeting us when we were leaving or arriving back and always willing to provide help with directions, transport etc. The housekeeping was very discreet and always respected the 'do not disturb' sign. A special mention must go to Julio, the wine waiter at the daily wine reception. He seemed to take an interest in us and enjoyed hearing about what we had been up to each day and what our plans were for the next. He also went to great lengths to tell us how to get around as we mainly used the buses and cable cars when not walking. He even made a restaurant reservation for us when we asked his advice about where to eat. The evening wine reception was a lovely touch and the complimentary breakfast was welcome each morning and fresh, although it did become a little boring by the end of the week. Our room ( a king deluxe) was quite large as was the bathroom. The room overlooked the inside of the building but this didn't bother me as I had asked for a quiet room and I got just that. Although I know the other rooms had some great views of the bay. Besides we were out most of the time anyway. It was quiet at night and I never had any trouble sleeping, which was important to me after walking so much each day - all hills! The bed was comfy although the pillows were a little too high when using both but too low when using one! The hotel is situated in Pacific Heights which is obviously a wealthy neighbourhood and it was very peaceful at night. But the shops and restaurants on Filmore St are only a couple of blocks away and we got around easily by bus - there are a couple of stops within a block of the hotel either way. We enjoyed looking at the other beautiful houses and picking our favourites as we walked along. The hotel also provides internet access in the small 'business center' but they do charge for this - a bit of a bummer if you don't travel with a laptop. To summarise, I would say I really liked this hotel, it was great to come back each night knowing there would be peace and quiet and the staff were very professional. It was small enough to be intimate but we still had privacy.

When we made our reservation we were torn between booking two separate non-suite rooms or the adjoining two bedroom suite. We ended up going with the two separate rooms because of the giant cost difference. When we arrived at Hotel Drisco to check in, we were told that my parent's room had been upgraded to a suite, however both rooms were located in the basement, down the hall from the service entrance, across from an ice machine and the breakfast room. Our windows overlooked the kitchen of the hotel and the rooms were very dark. Needless to say we were disappointed and considered switching hotels, however the desk staff was able to move us both into an adjoining two bedroom suite on the corner of the top floor. The new rooms had beautiful light, gorgeous views of the Bay and Alcatraz and it was like we were staying in a completely different hotel. We loved, loved loved our new rooms. The adjoined two bedroom suites are great if you're traveling as a group, however one of the bedrooms in these two bedroom suites has no bathroom attached. You have to cross the private hall (to which both bedrooms in the suite have access) to get to the bathroom. If the person staying in the other bedroom is not traveling with you, you could conceivably be walking out of your shower into your room and pass a stranger in the hall. It was a bit bizarre. I would recommend this hotel ONLY if you are given a room on the top two floors. It would be quite loud otherwise, and much less private. The only problem is, you are given no guarantees as to where your room is until you check in. It's a bit of a gamble. Also, beware. The prices of rooms fluctuate. When we were moved to the double room suite, the price we were quoted at the desk was nearly $100 less per night than what we were quoted when we originally made the decision to stick with the smaller, single rooms. That said, bathrooms in both suites and non-suites were beautiful and large, the breakfast were very nice, and Thanh (sp?) the bellhop/doorman was so kind and friendly. We loved the private, neighborhood feel of Pacific Heights. There are some great nearby restaurants (try Sociale) and the buses run frequently if you're wanting to go further afield.

I could hear the gentleman next to us talk conversationally on his phone to someone named Chris so the rooms could use a little boost on the soundproofing, plus the pipes clanked pretty much all night. Maybe this was why we were offered an upgrade?

We also walked down to the waterfront area down the Lyon Street steps and caught the cable car over to Union Square for dinner and a pint at Johnny Foleys.

After reading Tripadvisor's rating of the hotel as No 1 in San Francisco we made a phone call, spoke to Marti on Reception, had a 2 bedroom suite recommended, followed this up with a booking which proved to be one of our best decisions ever! We adults and the children were treated with the utmost kindness. Nothing was a bother to all the staff. The standard of accommodation is excellent, but there is also a genuine warmth of welcome and a desire to ensure guests every comfort, Our son, his wife, and family are relocating in Summer 2009 to San Francisco from Edinburgh,Scotland, for two years, and it was very important that this first visit should make a favourable impression of the city. Hotel Drisco certainly was the perfect \"home from home\" for us all, particularly our 3year old grandson who, during our stay, started to call the hotel \"my other house\"! We found the stylish and most comfortable 2bedroom suite ideal for a family, as the adults had a delightful sitting room to relax in after busy days visiting schools, checking out areas to live, sightseeing, etc. The children could be peacefully sleeping in the bedrooms, necessary after transatlantic flights and a time change! Beds were superbly comfortable too! The excellent complimentary breakfasts and evening \"wine and cheese\", and 24 coffee/tea/iced water in the elegant lounge were a bonus to our comforts. Other guests were very friendly too, contributing to the warm ambiance created by the Manager and all his first class staff. The situation is stunning with a view down to the Bay.

To my knowledge there is no air conditioning however it's likely not needed there most of the year. We simply opened the windows when needed to let in the wonderful bay breeze (the weather was in the mid to upper 70's, quite unusual we were told for that time of year - and much appreciated!!). We reserved the hotel's town car one weekday morning to go to Union Square along with another guest which was a fantastic service. The breakfast buffet was delicious (hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, bagels, breads, croissants, fruit, meat and cheeses) and our coffee was refilled at our table each morning. We also loved the 24/7 coffee, tea and water available near the lobby , especially after a long day of sightseeing! We were able to order food delivered from \"Waiters on Wheels\" which was very convenient when we wanted to relax in our room (though our choice was an unfortunate one -Gino's Pizza was the worst I've ever had). We would probably have been much happier ordering any of the panini offered by the hotel. The Hotel Drisco is in a beautiful neighborhood (Pacific Heights) and we enjoyed walking around to see the gorgeous mansions and views of the bay.

We were not troubled by noise, although I would guess the rooms on the ground floor or nearer the lift may be noisier. It is a simple thing to request a higher room when making your booking. The bed was very comfortable, there is an in room safe, lots of hanging space, and a large bathroom. Tea and coffee is always available downstairs, as well as apples. Complementary water is provided the first night, but not thereafter. Housekeeping was efficient and very neat, we never had to request the room to be made up (which I have had to do in more expensive hotels), despite sometimes not vacating the room until after 2pm - the staff seemed to keep track of when we were there, and worked efficiently around us. There is a large DVD selection available at reception which we made use of, but otherwise we just used reception staff for taxi bookings really as we are fairly self sufficient. I was impressed to see how the staff dealt with all the trick or treaters that turned up on Halloween night - all charm and patience which was admirable. Wireless internet in the rooms was quick and easy to utilise. The breakfast was well laid out, and definitely what I like to eat - fresh bread, bagels, pastries, 4 types of cereal, oatmeal, cheese, cold meats, hot beverages. There were also condiments available eg mustard and mayonnaise which was a nice touch. Service was quick and efficient, tables were cleared quickly (necessary on weekends when there can be a short wait for a table), but there was never a sense of being rushed. The evening wine service was a highlight, entirely due to the utterly charming wine waiter/concierge, Julio. Julio was the friendliest most helpful person we spoke with, and his recommendations for dinner and activities were all absolutely reliable. We took a ferry to Sausalito from the Ferry Building and the number 10 bus back all at his suggestion, and it was a great day out (much better than the tours from Fisherman's Wharf as well as more reasonable).

I mentioned the noise problem to the front desk and asked if perhaps there was a quieter room. They informed me that I was in a quiet corner. I think they were right, comparatively speaking.

After experiencing a NASCAR type trip from the van driver thru the streets of SF, we made it and were greated warmly by Elizabeth the front desk associate. Bob (or was it Bill?) the bellman helped us with our overpacked luggage. Since we traveled most of the day to get there (we're East coast, not West), we wanted a quick bite before turning in for the night.. Bob (or is it Bill?) recommended a few places on Fillmore which more than met our needs. The next morning, we had breakfast downstairs in the dining room. A young man (name escapes me but he had a beard that needed a little help -- maybe a few more years might help) was there to assist the guests with more coffee, cleaning plates away and generally being helpful but not intrusive. Each evening, the hotel has a wine social for an hour. It's a nice way to end the day I thought. Strange, but few guests took advantage of this social. Maybe our east coast hours made it feel later than it was? Anyway, it was a great way to end the day. And the older gentleman who was there was more than helpful -- he was entertaining as well.

I felt really bad.The next day Elizabeth Carr \"waived\" the 1st night, but because we got a roll-up bed ( which ruined the sittingroom)we still had to pay for 2 nights the extra 25 dollars p.n. A true 1st class hotel would have apologized for the quality of the sofabed, the fact that 1 of us had a bad 1st night and would quietly have taken care of it. I really felt let down. The room itself was spacious and nice, but the fact that it has no AC means, also in this neighbourhood, that in September you have to sleep with an open window for air and will be constantly waking up because of the noise from the street.

However given Drisco's current top rating on tripadvisor, which influences decisions, I feel it's okay to be a little nit-picking on a few points: Breakfast - rather disappointing - almost no fresh fruit (apart from a boring bowl of apples, bananas and oranges) Overall ambiance - the decor throughout the hotel is restrained and tasteful, and generally for an old building, it is well maintained. However it is all rather bland and hotel-like, and creates an atmosphere that is impersonal and stiff. The primness of the breakfast room for example, where very, very subdued generic orchestral music accompanies breakfast, drove the couple at the table next to ours to hold their conversation in whispers!

Very helpful doorman (not so much for the snooty front desk guy... seemed like new part-time staff). Rooms a bit cramped and LOTS of noise from creaking pipes, floorboards, and adjacent rooms. Also very cold since our in room radiator didn't seem to work despite someone coming to fix it... had to call for an extra electric heater. Mind you we had a discounted rate and probably got a poor room as a result(??). Breakfast was included and although we had trouble finding a seat, the meal was very good.

We walked everywhere--and if walking up and down hills is too difficult, the Muni bus system is fantastic, inexpensive, and easily accessible. NO NEED for cabs ever, unless you have difficulty walking downhill to bus. If so, one can be gotten very easily by hotel---and I recommend you book their town car to & from airport. It is a flat rate and a 30 minute drive. Our room was beautifully appointed, w/the most delicious smelling lotions, etc. Every employee was exceptionally polite and attentive w/o being pretentious. Bob, the Doorman, guided us to the most exquisuite mansions in our area, and greeted us upon our daily returns--very impressed with our lengthy walks throughout SF. The Concierges took care of all our needs and offered recommendations, including personalized guides as desired. Julio, the evening wine and cheese server, was most wonderul. He always suggested the excellent dinner spots, refilled our glasses, offered hot appetizers, and on our last day, served some of the most delicious mango cheddar cheese imagined--with a great story behind it. Romeo served our morning cappacino's just the way I liked it--skim milk in a tall cup and refilled it with most graciously after my husband spilled it! The morning buffet is delicious. Once, when we needed some attention to a bathroom appliance, w/i seconds, someone appeared and was fully gracious and accommodating. The housekeeping staff served fresh ice cubes and cookies each evening. Do we ever miss this place--and San Francisco!! Trust me when I say this is THE place--and I am a difficult person to please hotel-wise. Also, we recommend the Slanted Door Vietnamese restaurant in the Ferry Building. Go early--hungry--you will be glad you did! We also adored Ploof, in the Beldin Alley in the Financial District--very Parisian with fabulous mussels. Lupa in the Noe Valley and A16 on Chestnut were wonderful Italian restaurants. Nothing was too expensive. Plus there are literally hundreds of tiny gems around the city to eat at--and we did our share. Loved Union, Sacramento, and Upper Fillmore for shopping. The upper Fillmore was our favorite nightspot as well--a very happening place and we enjoyed an inexpensive drink at Grove many an evening. Reminds us of our favorite SoHo neighborhood lounge. Walk over Russian Hill-soooo gorgeous--walk Macaundry Alley between Union and Green on Jones--indescribable. Of course there is Golden Gate, the Embarcadero, the Mission, SOMA, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. Warning--you absolutely NEED advance tix to Alcatraz! Take a ferry to Sausalito!

However parking is easy and plentiful on the street so it is no problem hiring a car and parking near the hotel. I just hired a car and was perfectly happy at the Drisco.

The staff from bell hop to front desk was unfailingly nice and polite which made staying here a real pleasure; additionally the hotel adds some choice \"extras\" such as a complimentary wine and cheese reception from 5-7PM, which was very pleasant. They also have a very small gym which though small, has well maintained machines. The only reason I could suggest for passing on this hotel would be if you had never visited San Francisco before and had a very limited amount of time there (for example 24-48 hours) and that is only because of the location, which is not close to any major tourist attractions (Fisherman's Wharf for example) though it is somewhat close to the Palace of Fine Arts.

The neighborhood of Pacific Heights is lovely & I cannot say enough about the wonderful, accomodating staff at this hotel. Everyone was friendly, while remaining very professional. Some of the people who really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable were: Elizabeth, at the front desk, who provided great dining recommendations, a complimentary brochure for a self-tour of Pacific Heights & many other helps to us, the concierge, Marti who is one of the most gracious people I've ever encountered working in the industry & who gave us some great suggestions (we loved Fillmore St, Marti & the great shops & restaurants!), & two bellmen, the day person, who was a very industrious, ever-present man whose name escapes me (he is an Asian man, smaller in stature) & who seemed to anticipate our every need both with luggage & parking. Also, Bobby, the evening person, who was a beam of sunshine whenever we saw him & so helpful. The housekeeping staff should be commended for their excellent attention to detail & thank you especially to whoever made up our room for our arrival. It was so welcoming! There was the bottle of sparkling wine on ice (which was rather melted due to our very late arrival!), a bucket of ice (again which had melted, however, it was very thoughtful & was promptly refilled when we checked in by the gentleman helping us with our luggage), the robes laid out on the bed & slippers on the floor, the welcome card. & a dish of fresh fruit which was refreshed daily. What a great introduction! The staff that attended the dining room for breakfast & the wine/cheese hour are equally to be commended; we'd especially like to recognize the man who worked the evenings we were there who really went out of his way to provide for us. Even though we'd arrive a bit close to 7 pm, he always made certain we had what we needed & we never felt rushed. Also the breakfast selections we thought excellent contrary to a previous post - there were hot & cold cereals, all types of breads including french bread, yogurt, cottage cheese, hard cooked eggs, yummy ham, turkey, two types of cheese (I enjoy this type of European fare for breakfast), an assortment of fresh fruit, juices, milk, coffee, pastries, etc. - more than adequate! We stayed in a 2 room suite which was spacious, with great city views & loved being able to open the windows; street noise was minimal to non-existant! A fan was provided upon request & we had great air circulation & it seriously did not feel that it was as hot as it was (100 degrees on 5/15!). Nighttime it cooled off considerably; we actually felt a bit chilly when we walked to dinner that night ~ 8:30 pm with the breeze. Thank you, Elizabeth for the dining recommendations - we really enjoyed both Osteria & Cafe Maritime. Ok, now just a brief note about what detracted from our stay a bit. When I made our reservation back in December 2007, I had specifically requested an upper level room in a quiet area because I am a very light sleeper. I know that they did try to fulfill the quiet area request & that our arrival was late (we did call ahead to let them know), but we were placed in a suite on the second floor (the hotel is 4 floors). I asked the desk person when we checked in (I think it was ~ 10:30 pm) if we could be on a higher level & he was rather dismissive & curt, stating that there were no other rooms available & the hotel was full. I was perturbed, because with our two other accomodations for this trip, we were assigned to a specific room ahead of time so I was assured that there was no one above us. Before 6 am the next morning, the noise started above us (we'd gone to sleep after midnight) & I later learned that the people had checked out that day. I realize that they needed to get ready to leave, but I could not go back to sleep as noise continued for a couple of hours. Elizabeth kindly had us moved to the room above us later that day (third floor), but there was still nothing available on the fourth floor. After going to sleep that night about midnight, I was awoken during the night for about 30 minutes to an hour with what sounded like people moving furniture around above us; when it stopped, I was able to go back to sleep with no further incidents. I guess my point is - an earlier review had stated that they were assigned to room 406 A (a suite). Knowing my requests from 5 months prior, it seemed to me that we should have been assigned to a similar higher level room. Although the hotel was a favorite for me on this trip, sleeping was the most difficult for me here. Also, we did have to call to the front desk as there was someone (staff or guest) smoking in the courtyard & the smell of cigarette smoke wafted up through our windows into our room. After speaking with Bob or Bobby, the problem was resolved. My husband wished there was a fan in the bathroom to combat moisture & I wished for softer toilet paper (ok, so I'm a fan of Charmin!), but other than that & the aforementioned overhead noise, we were very happy here & would gladly stay here again & recommend this hotel to our family & friends!", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cDrisco has unbeatable service\u201d", "Author": "Barjo10", "ReviewID": "UR16321443", "Content": "I found almost everything about the Hotel Drisco excellent.

The location is lovely...on a very quiet, upscale street in Pacific Heights. Our bed was very comfy, sheets soft. Like other previous reviewers, we were stunned at the fact that we were not once awoken by street noise. Honestly, it felt as if we were staying at a hotel in the countryside rather than in the middle of SF. It was that quiet! While this was a lovely hotel...I wouldn't rank it as one of the top places I've ever stayed. * I tend to prefer more modern decor and a slightly more casual environment. * I also like to know if I happen to be hungry \"after hours,\" I can get food delivered to my room instead of prowling the streets looking for a late-night takeout joint. * Our morning shower was unfortunately tepid which does tend to put a negative spin on the day (at least for me). * And I can't say I was that blown away by the continental breakfast--yes, it was good but I personally didn't find it to be anything out of the ordinary (aside from the delicious fresh squeezed OJ).

We absolutely loved this hotel! We made our reservation months in advance and were thrilled to receive such amazing service and attention even prior to our arrival. Elizabeth at the front desk generously answered many e-mails with wonderful advice as to car rental, restaurants, and area attractions. Bob gracefully handled the front door greeting duties, welcoming us by name when we arrived. Our room was perfect. Room 406A! It was a two-room suite that had to be about 800 sq. feet. With the high ceilings, plentiful windows on two sides of the room, two flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (one in the living room and one in the bedroom), very comfortable bed, and full amenities, we were most content. This particular room is reached by entering through a door into a private hallway. It was a very quiet room, something that is very important to us when we travel. In fact, we never heard another guest while in our lovely room. The furniture and draperies are simple and nice (not luxurious, but quite cheery and pleasant) and the rooms were immaculately clean. We thought the bathroom was beautiful. For a property as old as this one is, it was impeccably maintained. We enjoyed the little touches such as robes and slippers set out at turndown service along with cookies, bottled water, and the next day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather report. We also liked the 24-hour coffee and tea available in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sitting room as we were able to take coffee to go when we set out to explore each day. It was a little warm our first night, though with the windows open and the fan the hotel provided, we had a most comfortable first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rest. As room 406A is on the back left side of the property (which sat upon a very steep hill-it is San Francisco, after all), it felt like we were much higher up from ground level, providing unobstructed views of the city. If we peered out the living room windows and looked to the left, we could see the San Francisco Bay. We loved the spaciousness, peacefulness, and privacy this room provided. And the walks around the neighborhood (the expensive Pacific Heights neighborhood) were spectacular. In a simple mile-loop (the hotel provides a map), one can walk past mansions worth tens of millions of dollars. So not only can one gaze upon the beautiful San Francisco Bay on this stroll, but you can gape at the beauty of neighborhood dwellings. The Presidio park is also a block from the hotel, providing easy access to walks in the forest. We loved being able to park within a block of the hotel for free and access our vehicle whenever we wished. We also enjoyed the peaceful of this property versus staying within the craziness and congestion of San Francisco proper. Visits to most San Francisco sights were only a 10-minute drive. We would imagine some of the rooms whose windows looked out over the front entrance of the hotel might be exposed to the conversational noise of passing pedestrians or lingering hotel guests, but I suspect it is not a significant problem as it really is a quiet neighborhood with little street traffic. Breakfast is free every morning in the sunny and bright dining room with several copies of The San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, and Wall Street Journal available to read. Breakfast is buffet-style with croissants, scones, cereal, toast, bagels, oatmeal, and fruit. Breakfast can also be delivered in your room at no extra charge. The service at breakfast as in the rest of the hotel was perfection. The staff was kinder than that at The Four Seasons properties at which we usually stay when we travel.

Marti, concierge extraordinaire, suggested that we shop in the Union Street area after lunch. We did, had an extraordinary time with retailers who went the extra mile, and fell in love with Pacific Heights. While our room did not have an ocean or street view, we had two large sets of windows, one of which opened onto an inner courtyard filled with tropical plants. Our room was very quiet and large with a sitting area. Our suite was conveniently located down the hall from the dining room. We visited it two times daily for the wine tasting and incredible breakfasts. Julio and Omar, serving staff, went out of their ways to welcome us and make us feel like family. For example, after our a.m. arrival, Omar stopped me in the hall to ask if I would like some pastries with my coffee which I had been invited to take from the salon area on the main floor. Now that's service! Marti, the Concierge who took our phone reservation, remembered that our trip was in honour of my husband's birthday. After returning to our suite the first day, we found a 1/2 bottle of sparkling California wine chilling in a cooler of ice and a gracious note wishing my husband many happy returns from the Staff. How is that for attention to detail! The front office staff always had the time and interest to listen to our escapades when we returned from our daily explorations of SFO on foot. There was nothing they couldn't do for us.

From Marti's helpfulness with our reservation to her phone call before we left home to the hot towel and water bottle given us at check-in ( both welcome after a long flight) we knew we had made the right choice. Elizabeth is a gem, helping us with directions and restaurant suggestions and giving us ideas of things to do. The room was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. Our room had been newly renovated so everything felt and looked very fresh and clean. Breakfast is quite good featuring hot and cold cereal, bagels, pastries, meats and cheese and delicious orange juice. Others have mentioned the noisy pipes. They are only noisy when the heat goes on, which, when we stayed, was usually after 7 or 7:30 am. However there is another caveat- even though the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood the garbage trucks and recycling pickup can still be noisy. The trucks did not come too early and I am sure there are interior rooms where the sound is more muffled. We loved the location of our room and would choose it again regardless of street noise. The hotel is not far from both Fillmore and Union Streets each of which has trendy boutiques and restaurants. We also enjoyed free walking tours given by City Guides.

After I checked out the deal -- about $700 for three nights, with some minor extras -- I sussed out the hotel on TripAdvisor and at the time it was the top-rated hotel in San Francisco! Not bad. It had \"descended\" to no. 4 by the time we booked (still not bad) and so we committed. Loved it. The Drisco, as a cab driver who picked us up there commented, is the \"incognito\" hotel. If you want a Union Square location in the middle of everything, this isn't the place for you. But if you want to be in the heart of one of the most glamorous, beautiful neighborhoods in any city in the U.S., a relatively convenient walk from key city amenities like restaurants and shops, it's a great place. It felt very European. Cozy. Great service that starts with a call to your home a few days before arrival. \"Do you want to use our car service from the airport?\" For a $15 difference between hiring an ordinary taxi and using a dedicated car, we bit and it was worth it. When the driver pulled up in front of the hotel, on a peak crest of the hills overlooking the Bay, I thought it was a private club. It felt like that the whole time. Scrupulously well-maintained (and in fact they were upgrading rooms and suites while we were there with new carpets, flat screens and DVDs to replace existing electronics). Great bathrooms with deep soaking tubs. Nice amenities. With a quiet and lofty presence above San Francisco (our suite, living room with television, couch, cozy by-the-window chairs, and our bedroom, with a working desk, free Internet, another television, great bed, bathrobes and slippers) had great city views. The whole feeling was of a first rate hotel for those who like feeling comfortable, and even pampered, without pretension. At cocktail hour there was a wine and savories set-up, quite cozy (and we even brought in a local friend and no one batted an eye, only wished I remembered the name of the white wine because it was crisp and delicious). Breakfast was European in nature -- cold cuts, yogurt, oatmeal, made-to-order coffees, croissants. Included in, I believe, all room rates (though check on it). Adored the neighborhood -- with its multi-million dollar mansions, gorgeous greenery (even in February). Service at the desk was consistently excellent. I asked for taxis, for the exact color of the paint in the breakfast room (a very nice yellow, we're buying a new-old house and I love yellow), even asking for a promised-in-our-deal bottle of sparkling wine, which hadn't been delivered, was met with a gracious apology and fixed immediately. Would return to the Drisco, part of the Joie d'Vivre chain (and my first experience with this boutique hotel group) without qualification. The only qualification I will offer is that good news, bad news bit about the location. The neighborhood is gorgeous. But it's a good five to seven blocks (easy) from anything commercial. If you walk over to Fillmore Street, to Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow shops and restaurants, wear comfy shoes cause you're going to experience the hills that made San Fran so famous. Even more challenging: the Marina District below. It's in interesting mountain slog (up and down) to Lombard Street and points below, like Chestnut Street's restaurants and shops (I used to live in the Marina so I was more inclined to head downward this way). FYI, we had a great time at Curbside Two (again, a steep slog down toward Presidio), a fantastic small, provincial French bistro -- the weather was so crystal clear blue and warm weather crisp that I had my burger and fries (awesome) and glass of Syrah at a picnic table outside. It was a favorite off-beat place when I lived there and it was great to see it was the same. We had dinner at A16 on Chestnut Street in the Marina, which is currently a hot place; I was underwhelmed by this Italian bistro. We had a surprisingly romantic lunch at Emporio Rulli Gran Caffe, which reminded me more of the old fashioned kind of department store restaurants (in ambience, a bit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6old fashioned). But the food was excellent and so was the wine. A big surprise on the \"strip\". Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t' get to Bistro Aix (it was closed on the nights we were there) but wished we had; the menu looked lovely. Next trip. Will just make sure I get a real series of workouts in steep, hill-climbing scenarios. And by the way: though we did have the pleasure of wandering the bay front around the Marina, we never did make it into the heart of San Francisco.

He recommended 2 of his favorites by providing menus, reviews and directions (we chose Cafe Maritime). On the second night of our stay, we decided to stay in. We had walked all the way to Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building and back and we were too exhausted and achy to do much more than enjoy a glass or two of wine and climb into our very comfy bed.

I wasn't disappointed! Having stayed in the large, impersonal and crowded hotels along the waterfront and on Van Ness, I wanted to be away from the tourists and the most popular tourist areas. I looked forward to walking, and over the 3 1/2 days that we were in San Francisco my husband and I walked about 65 km (40 mi.). Buses are available to take you wherever you want to go (or back towards the Hotel) if you are too tired to walk back. Being on the crest of a hill, leaving the Hotel is the easy part - it is the return trip that can be challenging, and I am always amazed at just how steep the hills can be. You will certainly burn off a good portion of your Ghirardelli chocolate on the way back to the Hotel, especially if you climb the almost 300 steps on Lyon Street back up to Broadway!! I wanted to commend Julio who presides over the evening wine aperitifs who made us feel like family and gave us some great advice on local restaurants and sights to see. I also highly recommend the Town car airport pick-up and drop-off - more expensive than the airport shuttle but worth every penny in comfort, convenience and conversation with Roberto. Our room in the Hotel was small but comfortable. We were on the fourth floor at the end of a private hallway, and had views of both the harbour and the city. Street noise does carry at night but we found this varied, with some nights being very quiet and other nights being much noisier. We did have to open the windows as the room did become stuffy after an hour or two. I understand that some renovations will be occuring shortly. Some of the furniture in our room was showing wear and tear. The bed was very comfortable (and I have a bad back, so I was grateful for this) and the towels and housecoats are some of the nicest I have had in a hotel. The continental breakfast is very good but could have used some variety from day to day - perhaps a variety of pastries (but don't change those blueberry scones!) or a fruit salad with those wonderful California melons. Bottom line is if you enjoy unique and charming surroundings in a small, out-of-the-way hotel with personal service, the thrill of exploring an historic city on foot, and discovering hidden gems of restaurants and shops, then this is the Hotel and area for you.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cNice stay\u201d", "Author": "TGS67", "ReviewID": "UR8659336", "Content": "We stayed at a City View Suite and it was comfortable, clean and quiet.

We were totally lost and he was very patient and went out of his way looking up various maps for getting us to the hotel. We had not eaten dinner so we asked for a late night grill and he recommended Liverpool Lil's which was only a few blocks down the street. Grill was open at midnight and they served terrific food. Very cool, Irish pub. For those who would like a quick stop for a pint and lunch/dinner, you can't go wrong with Liverpool Lil's and it's close to the hotel. We checked in and were booked in one of the rooms on the first floor literally behind the check-in desk. Window was open to Pacific avenue and although the room was very nice, be sure to ask for an upper level room or something towards the back of the hotel. We heard EVERY noise on the street, including the conversations at the check-in desk when someone arrived late for check-in. Several people staying at the hotel arrived at 3am in the morning and proceeded to stand out in front right next to our windows smoking cigarrettes and talking loudly. The next morning when we got up and opened the windows for the cool fresh air, the smokers lingering outside would fill the room with the smoke/smell. The room was clean (albeit a little outdated with old carpet) but comfortable. Front desk help was first class and made up for the bad room location.

This 3 night trip we decided to learn a new neighborhood and sought out the Drisco because it was in Pacific Heights and part of the same small hotel group as the Petite Auberge. It is located in on of the grandest \"modern\" residential streets in the city, and literally at the top of a very steep hill near the Presidio's east side. Though I was a bit worried that we would be too far away from things, our wonderful experience made up for any inconvenience of the location. There is a good bus line only 1 block away (down the hill) -we walked or used the bus to \"go\" places (especially the Fillmore Street shopping/restaurant area) - then usually got a cab back to the hotel -especially at night (as from the theatre) when we were tired. If climbing hills isn't on your agenda, a car or cab is a necessity. As others have noted, the front desk staff was FABULOUS - even loaning us a copy of a book detailing interesting walking tours in SF. Our \"King\" room was on the 2nd floor overlooking the street, but off in the far distance we could see the city,the Oakland bridge, and a bit of the Bay. We happened to be looking out our window the night Barry Bonds broke the home run record and saw the baseball stadium fireworks celebrating the event - magical. Our room was on a separate short hallway with another (corner) room- if you wanted 2 rooms as a \"suite\", I think (?) the hallway door to the main hallway could be locked. As the room windows faced southeast, our room was really sunny most of the day - VERY bright and cheerful (a white bedspread helped too). There were drawers for clothes under the TV and a HUGE closet (for a hotel that is). Some of the other reviews said the rooms needed renovation, but we thought ours was lovely. Though the usual snacks and drinks were for sale in the room, there was a complimentary bottle of water- nice. The extra \"special\" toiletries for sale were a bit pricey, but tempting (like fizzy balls for the bathtub). The room decoration was traditionally elegant, tending towards the restrained rather than fussy, with the bathroom reminding me of Restoration Hardware/Pottery Barn style. A newspaper is hung on your doorknob mornings in a trim canvas bag - a surprising little touch that indicates the management is really trying to make a stay pleasing. As the hotel is on a steep hill, the breakfast room (more like an elegant dining/living room) is in the \"basement\" but has large windows with view to the street...and a seating area in addition to tables for those who just want a coffee and to read the paper. The breakfast (included in room rate) had cereals/fruits/deli meats/ breads/drinks - very ample for a good start to the day. The only disappointment was that the \"wine & cheese\" in the late afternoon was in a smallish reception/living room and sparsely attended during our stay. In the Petite Auberge, the same event always had tons of people to visit with - exchange travel & tourist hints, etc. Perhaps our experience happened because we perceived fellow guests at the Drisco included families with children (8 yrs or so up- no little children) and under 35's, not the baby boomers / retirees more common at the Petite Auberge....But I wouldn't mark the hotel down for that as it might just have been the mix of guests during our stay. We booked on the Joie de Vivre group website and got a good discount for staying 3 nights. The photos from other guests give a good representation of the hotel's atmosphere. Even thought the Drisco is removed from the main tourist areas, there are many walks to take (Union Street, the Presidio, the Lyon steps, historic Pacific Heights, and close to the Exploratorium and Marina/ Ft. Mason/Greens Restaurant). It is soooooo relaxing/quiet because of the residential location - we felt a part of the neighborhood and loved not seeing tons of tourists. This hotel is popular, so one needs to plan ahead to book if you want specific rooms or dates.

This was our first trip to SF, and I agonised over hotels for some time, particularly weighing up a central location against one further out. In choosing The Drisco, I have no doubt that we made absolutely the right choice (given that we Brits are also mean, and thus will never spend more than we have to. In other words, its good value, as I do not have the requisite funds to lounge at The Mark Hopkins). While you could criticise The Drisco for being a little way out of the centre, the upside is that it is quiet (give or take the odd dustbin lorry, sorry, garbage truck at 8.00am), and you are in a very attractive (and achingly affluent) neighbourhood. In any event, a taxi ride is simple to arrange (thanks to the very helpful staff at The Drisco, sometimes up to 3 times a day) and the cost is very modest. You also then get to meet some of the miriad of interesting characters that SF has to offer, as the taxi drivers are a mirror of this cosmopolitan city, many amusing and charming, the odd one rude or mad, but always different. In summary for The Drisco - Excellent, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and clean rooms with neat little touches of detail, modestly stylish decor that struck the right balance between neutrality and warmth, very good breakfast, emminently useable fitness room, and a place that you looked forward to coming back to. My gripe is purely the quality of the television programmes, but then thats hardly the fault of the Hotel. Oh, and more of their delectable free cookies would have been nice, but then thats simply me being greedy. And there are places within walking distance, providing you dont mind a bit of an uphill hike back to the Hotel. This includes a number of good restarants, but none better than Elizas at California Street - Authentic chinese, possibly the best I have ever tasted, and at ridiculously reasonable (or frankly low for us bearing in mind the pound's supremacy over the dollar at present) prices.

I made my reservation on the phone directly with a staff member who, in the course of our conversation, asked me how I learned about the hotel. I explained that my husband and I had eaten there in 1990 when it was called the El Drisco and still had a restaurant, and that the meal had been our first date. And I explained that our return was an anniversary of that event. She seemed quite pleased with my story, and we had a pleasant exchange all around, and it was one of those rare times I was glad I had called instead of making a reservation online. When we arrived we learned we had been upgraded to a suite, and when we opened the door to that suite we found a chilled split of champagne and a lovely chocolate heart waiting for us. Of course none of this thoughtfulness would compensate if the room was unsatisfactory or the hotel a disappointment, but I found it all precisely to my liking. There are photographs of San Francisco from the 1890s on the wall of the hallway, perfectly appropriate for this old, well-preserved building. And the furnishings are tastefully age-appropriate as well--without being fussy or fusty. The bed, thankfully, was modern: firm. The bathroom amenities? Aveda. And there's a neat little bathroom \"mini-bar\" with tea bags and fizzers for the bath tub and other such items. But most of all, aside from the occasional creak and water-through-the-pipes whoosh, which I associate with the life of an older building, Hotel Drisco is deeply, soothingly quiet. Like from-another-century quiet. It's the perfect respite from a day of heavy sight-seeing or relative handling. Or, as it was for my husband on that anniversary, and will be for me next week, a perfect rest stop before minor surgery the next day.", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cIf you need to ask...\u201d", "Author": "6doctors", "ReviewID": "UR7155756", "Content": "Hotel Drisco is in the midst of haute Pacific Heights, a beautiful neighborhood of incredibly expensive homes with drop-dead views over the city and the Golden Gate Bridge.

Having previously lived in SF for years, we'd never checked into a local hotel before (but had seen plenty through work and friends). The Drisco was a rate treat -- an affordable property with superior service. PROS: -The views! Be sure to ask for a room with a city or bay view (one person in our group had a courtyard view, and therfore, a dimly lit room). Our city view was, in a word, spectacular: all of Lower Pac Heights, the Haight, downtown... all the way to Twin Peaks. -The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and spotless. Our bathroom had a wall-to-wall window and glassed-in tub/shower so you can catch the view from your bath. -The service was excellent. Turn-down at night comes with fresh cookies and a pitcher of ice. The front desk went out of their way for us, even after we had checked out. -Complementary wine and cheese happy hour every evening. -The free continental breakfast (cereal, oatmeal, croissants, fruit). -The price: a fraction of what other \"luxury\" hotels in town charge. CONS -Every morning at 5:45 a.m. on the dot, the strong smell of coffee permeated our room. It literally smelt like someone was brewing a pot right next to our pillows (several other guests shared similar experiences). Obviously, this isn't a problem for those who love coffee -- or get up at 5:45 -- but as we don't, it was unpleasant and hard to fall back asleep -Location. Though the Drisco is in arguably the most beautiful neighborhood in the city, it's very difficult to catch a cab. We ended up waiting at least 25 to 35 minutes, sometimes longer, each time we went anywhere. This is not the hotel's fault, but keep in mind you'll either have to plan/call way ahead or rent a car. All in all, a great stay.

We had tickets for a concert on a Saturday afternoon and thought it might be fun to spend the night in a lux hotel to add to our celebration. A search on TripAdvisor brought my attention to the Drisco. Since we live just across the bay, we didn't need to be in a downtown location. We preferred charm and personality over a corporate-type hotel. The Drisco had a vacancy for us and I just happened to mention it was our Anniversary while speaking to the lovely man on the phone to make our reservation. We quickly packed a bag and made the 1/2 drive across the Golden Gate Bridge on a gorgeous, sunny day to the Pacific Heights area of The City. Knowing The City quite well, we knew we couldn't go wrong in Pacific Heights. We were welcomed to the Hotel like \"old friends\" and were given an upgrade (because it was our Anniversary) to a gorgeous suite. What a delight!! It was a corner room with a lovely vista out over rooftops across The City with soft, tasteful furnishings and an exquisite bathroom. We were so happy that we decided to spend another night!! And, to top it all off, they brought us champagne and chocolates!! We had a very nice continental breakfast (included) the next morning, coffee and tea were available 24 hours a day in the beautiful \"sitting room\", and they also served afternoon wine and cookies. We loved every minute of our beautiful weekend celebration. We walked and walked and walked because in San Francisco there are so many beautiful places with beautiful vistas...The Marina Green to Fort Point...Union Street...Chestnut Street...Pacific Heights... The Presidio...plus so many others. On our second night, the fog rolled in to make the \"romantic\" feel complete. Thank You, Hotel Drisco staff, for a wonderful weekend.

It is an old house so everything creaks, this may appear charming but at 4am in the monring if anyone moves it will be heard and wake you up. also the hotel has no air conditioning. Alot of houses in San Fran don't have air conditioning due to the cool weather but most hotels do. Even average hotels here in the UK will have air conditioning and its colder here than San Fran. So if you want some air you have to open the window which ensures you will be woken by the street noise, cars etc. The rooms are very small so they do get stuffy easily so you have to open the window. The location is also not great. Pacific Heights is a very nice suburb but it is not within walking distance to Union Sq or Fishermans wharf so you have to taxi everywhere. There is no taxi stop nearby so you have to ask the front desk to ring you a taxi every time you want to go somewhere. For a B+B guesthouse it would be of a good standard and the breakfast is very impressive in a lovely room, but it has hotel prices so is totally not worth it.

First of all the Pacific Heights area is really residential, quiet and old world elegant. There are many absolutely gorgeous homes in the surrounding area. One can see the water views standing on the street corner outside. With that said, if you are the typical tourist, it's really not that close to any touristy spots. I would venture to guess that Union Square is a good 25 minutes walk (up and down steep hills, btw), as is Fisherman's Pier. It's not convenient to any of the trolley stops either. There's a complimentary car service to Union Square in the morning, but the rest of the time you have to find your own transportation. The decoration of the room is tasteful and elegant. Very comfortable bed but very stiff robe and slippers for some reason (need fabric softener!). Secondly, I don't know if it's the location of my room, but starting from 6AM I can hear my neighbor walking in his room, getting ready in the morning. The floor board creaks mercilessly and sounded like a herd of elephants stampeding. Needless to say I got no sleep from that point on. Third, there is no central A/C or heat. A/C may not be a problem since S.F. doesn't get that hot in the summer, but the kicker is that when the radiator turned on at 7AM in the morning it gave out such loud pinging noises that I thought someone was doing remodeling work next door. The breakfast, although touted as gourmet, was nothing to write home about. It's the basic starch, plus boiled eggs, although set in a very elegant dining area. The service was outstanding. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly without being intrusive. I was impressed when they called and paid for a taxi cab ride when the complimentary ride was running late.

We hope to visit SF again soon and would definitely stay at the Hotel Drisco.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel with great staff and service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3841986", "Content": "My husband, son and I recently stayed at the Hotel Drisco.

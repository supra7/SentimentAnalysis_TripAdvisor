After around 30 minutes of trying, eventually I was let into the original block and luckily found a space. Very frustrating as they knew I was paying for parking at the hotel and should have reserved a space for me. Otherwise the hotel is OK, although the elevators need updating. The service was OK as well, except in the bar, where it was non existent. I actually was going to eat there, but when I had to call the bar tender over as he was busy chatting to a customer and totally ignored me, I quickly changed my mind. The bar was empty except for the other customer and myself by the way. I would recommend the bar next door where the service was great, food was good and is very popular.

There's a unified decoratiing theme, low-key natural colors, leaf images, etc. The furniture is unoffensively modern. They did a good job considering they were working with an old hotel. There are nice robes in the closet and granite in the very clean bathroom. The bed was comfortable and also tastefully decorated with a white comforter. The front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. The restaurant next door, part of the hotel, \"McCays\" served a delicious breakfast - large portions, beautifully arranged on the plate, delicious,good service. I was so surprised to find a hotel restaurant at this location with this level of food! The lunch and dinner menus looked equally tempting. The hotel is adjacent to the University. A branch of the USC Bookstore is located off the lobby, making it convenient to purchase a gift for your kid or yourself. I was expecting average/bland... maybe worse, but what I found was... excellent. If you need to visit USC, why bother with going back and forth on the freeways? Stay on campus at the Radisson.

Clean but shabby in lobby and on \"Executive\" floor to which I was assigned. Alas, the advertised \"Executive Lounge\" on the floor was unavailable because it was rented out to some construction company as field office. The electronic keys did not work and required one to repeat insert process 10-20 times each time one entered room. Room was drab, clean, smelled slightly of a stale locker room, with \"Sleep Comfort Bed\", flat screen TV, and old floral paintings.

The main reason we decided to stay here was because the cost was a lot lower than other hotels in the surrounding area, and we trusted the Radisson name to have certain standards. After reading the online reviews we had some hesitations, but overall our experience was fairly positive. When we entered the hotel we were greeted by friendly staff members (during our stay the front desk staff also assisted us with information about local attractions and shopping). It was clear that the lobby had been recently renovated and it was very modern and clean. When we arrived in our room we had just a few small problems. The safe was originally not working, but after we called the front desk someone did come up quickly to repair it. We also had an issue with our air conditioner leaking onto the floor (but did not notice it until the last couple of days and did not bother to report it to the staff members). The overall feel for the room was nice. Our room was always cleaned well, and the level we were on was very quiet. The bathroom area would be the only area for complaint. While spacious, the ceilings were cracked and peeling and the bathtub was in need of repairs. WARNING: if you are about to stay in the hotel, exit the bathtub with extreme caution. It is raised well above the floor and will result in you falling and slipping if you are not careful (I am speaking from the experience of my friend who did fall). Aside from the hotel room itself, the hotel featured a lovely pool area (that we witnessed being cleaned daily), and fitness center (that was being upgraded, but still useable). The hotel also featured a \u201cbusiness center\", which was literally one computer just past the front desk that had very poor connections to the internet, if you could get it to connect at all. The lack of access to the internet was the main disappointment with the hotel. Another disappointment was about parking. We knew that parking was an extra fee daily, but what we did not expect was to have a parking ticket on our car due to our permit being \"improperly displayed\". This was an issue of the USC Parking Staff, who were very rude and unreasonable when we went to go discuss our ticket with them. On the plus side, the restaurant located beside the hotel was perfect for a fast, delicious and affordable lunch. We went multiple times during our stay.

We did eat an early , good breakfast at Mckay's~ I must say the coffee is FABULOUS! Rich, dark, flavorful~ a great change from the weak, see-through coffee one often finds in hotels. As for the Sleep Number beds?? If we had one, I wasn't aware of it~ and judging from the reviews, it seems we were not missing a thing! So perhaps that's a blessing! :-) The hotel served its purpose; sadly, thougtthe restaurant was great and the staff was friendly and accommodating I would not stay here again UNLESS it was for a quick, convenient overnight to attend a close-by event.

I choose this hotel because I had some business to do in downtown LA, and since I had a gift certificate to a Radission (that Radisson gave me as a result of a previous problem at another property) I choose this hotel since it was the closest Radisson to downtown LA.

Room: I checked-in, and the agent asked another employee if the room was ready, I thought this as normal, and brushed it off. When I arrived at the room, it was old, musty, hot, and had a horrible smoke odor (the hotel is supposed to be 100% non smoking). I left my bags in the room and went back to the check-in desk. A different agent assigned me a new room on the same floor. The new room was better, but definately was not rennovated, and had several sticky stains on the carpet. The rooms are old, and the bathrooms are small, with old gross toilets, and odd tubs that are atleast 2 feet off the floor. There is even a sign in the bathroom warning to use the handrail when getting in and out of the tub. There was also no high speed internet as advertised on Radisson's website. Service: As I Said before, service was horrible, besides doing the basics of check-in and check-out. Location: This hotel is right on the main USC campus, and is also within walking distance from the Shrine Auditorium, besides that, there is really not much in the area. Dining: Since there is hardly anything in the area, I ordered room service. The 6\" pizza for $6.95 was horrible and had a bad taste and the french fries had a horrible aftertaste. I would not recommend ordering from any of the on-site resturants at all costs. Misc: As other reviews have noted, the first 5 floors of this hotel double as a USC student dorm, which would have been nice if guests were warned of this before checking in.

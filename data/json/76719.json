Front desk clerks were extremely helpful and friendly. Small indoor pool that no one was ever in. It was supposed to be heated, but still kind of chilly for this time of year. Their advertised new hot tub was just a residential type that was sitting outside the back door of the lobby under a gazebo. It was only working one night out of the 3 that we were there and it looked overcrowded with one other couple already in it. Full breakfast was included in the room price and was pretty good.

They understand that to be in the hospitality business, its important to be \"hospitable\"! We checked ratings in several places before booking and the hotel was highly regarded by customers. Those ratings are no mistake. We had an excellent experience at this hotel. We arrived about 1 a.m. after a grueling three-hour drive over fog-covered two-lane mountain roads. Despite the late hour the clerk cheerfully greeted us and quickly completed the check-in process. At registration the clerk presented a \"rewards\" sack containing a couple of bottles of water, a bag of microwave popcorn...and a number of sample products and coupons. The samples probably cost the hotel nothing, but the fact they were thoughtful enough to collect and package them was very impressive. I've never received anything quite like it from this level of hotel during a million miles of business travel. Our room was extremely clean and very well-appointed. It was somewhat cramped but had enough room for two. Among the amenities one detail caught my attention...a box with three electrical outlets attached to the table. In most places we must search for a spare wall outlet or recharge devices on the vanity. This box was just one of many examples of attention to detail. Other amenities included standards like a large flat-screen TV, ample dresser, coffeemaker and micro-fridge...and some unexpected luxuries like a vanity cabinet, extra pillows, and a towel folded into a swan. An indoor salt-water pool is available for those who want to relax and drift a while. At three feet deep, it's not designed for serious swimming. But it could be a great place to unwind. The hotel sits on a relatively steep hill overlooking historic downtown Branson. An easy downhill two-block walk gets you to Dicks Five-and-Dime and other shops. (Of course, you've got to walk uphill to return to the hotel!) Branson Landing lies about a half-mile further. We had a great time exploring the area on foot. The proximity to shops could be a real advantage \"in-season\" when Branson roads are clogged with cars. Although we had a wonderful stay, there were a couple of things that weren't quite as good as other hotels recently visited. While our bed wasn't \"uncomfortable\", the mattress obviously had been around a while. Our room faced Highway 76 and was sometimes noisy due to traffic outside. (Easy solution: ask for a room on the other side of the property.) The biggest disappointment was breakfast: it lacked variety we've seen at other hotels in this price range. Despite these minor flaws, we'd return here because of the overwhelmingly positive overall experience. From the front desk to the housekeepers to the general manager, everyone was kind, courteous, and efficient. Coupled with the comfortable room, thoughtful amenities and central location, the Branson Landing Best Western Plus is the type of place we wish we could find everywhere.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Centerton, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cNot what I was hoping for...but it works\u201d", "Author": "C B", "ReviewID": "UR124155644", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here one night for our anniversary. We wanted to be close to the Branson Landing so this hotel seemed only right to choose. While our stay wasn't bad, it wasn't what I was hoping for. Access to the rooms is from outside so that was one big draw back for me. Because of this, we heard so much noise that it really was bothersome--People walking, yelling (since it was outside), cars & trucks revving up/driving around, cleaning crew's cart was loud rolling over concrete, etc. We purposefully asked for a room away from the main street but that didn't really stop us from hearing sirens and other loud vehicles that drove past. We were also on the 2nd floor so we heard every step the people above us took. Our room was right on the corner of two walkways so we heard significant noise throughout the day and night since it was a high traffic area. The breakfast was typical-small biscuits and gravy, sausage, a few selections of cereal, small bagels and yogurt. Nothing over the top but it was free so that was a plus. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated. Our bed, however, had a large curve in it so as we slept, we slowly drifted towards each other. This was a little annoying as it cause me to sleep outside of my normal positions. The curtains kept the room dark so we were able to sleep much longer than we typically do.

The rooms were average size probably a little larger than some of the newer hotels. This is an older establishment. They are remodeling the rooms but the outside and corridors are trashy looking. The continential breakfast was lousy. Some of the others hotels in Branson have them beat hands down. They only serve donuts, apples, toast, or dry cereal. It's pretty blah!! The swimming pool is indoors and nice they only down side is it's only 3FT from end to end. We asked for a non-smoking room but the room smelled of smoke. I've come to the conclusion this is very common especially when you stay in an older hotel. I've experienced this several times in Branson. The front desk people are not that friendly. We had a difficult time finding a place to park one night because the parking lot was full. When we asked the fromt desk clerk were we could park. She acted like she didn't believe us when we told her the parking lot was full. We finally found a spot in a different parking lot very far away from our room. One good thing about the hotel was we did have a refrigerator, microwave, and coffeemaker.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cFriends to Branson\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5229586", "Content": "This is the first review I felt I needed to write: This is THE WORST Motel/Hotel I have ever stayed at in my 44 years of traveling.

This is an older facility but it has recently been updated. It was VERY clean, had all the amnities we had at the more expensive hotels, and the pool was open 24 hours (!!!) . I was extremely pleased with the value for the price we paid! The staff was very friendly and helpful with the fastest routes to take to get to various attractions. The comp breakfast was pretty much the standard fare, but hey, at least they offered it! And the location is great! It is just a couple of blocks east of Highway 65, so you don't have to deal with the congestion of the main streets to get to your hotel, but it's easy to get to the back-roads to got to all the main attractions.

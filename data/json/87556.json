A free breakfast is always nice, but the area in which it was offered was so small that you really couldn't obtain what food there was--one waffle maker and a toaster simply aren't enough when 4 or 5 families of four enter the breakfast room within 15 minutes of each other. The second morning of our stay we didn't even bother to try to get the breakfast. There were also some elements of hospitality missing that I would expect from any chain hotel--for instance, the only street map of the town available was a very poor copy of a copy of a copy and the street names were unreadable--to make matters worse, when we asked the desk attendant for directions to a restaurant located at a specific address, she insisted that the restaurant was located on a completely different intersection, and her directions got us lost.

We make the trip several times a year and usually stay at another hotel in the area - but unfortunately they were booked. We later found out there were baseball/softball tournaments, a dog show and several other events taking place in Champaign. Once we arrived, the problems began. The trip took longer than expected and we arrived around 11:15 PM. When I went to check-in, another guest was waiting and there was a sign left by the front desk saying, \"we'll be right back.\" We waited 15 minutes before the desk clerk arrived to check us in. We had arranged for a crib for our toddler, but it wasn't in the room when we arrived. The room was filthy with trash on the on the floor, one unmade bed and furniture pulled away from walls with piles of trash behind it. The desk clerk brought us a high chair, instead of the crib and agreed that the room hadn't been cleaned. The halls and reception area were trashy and dirty as well. He gave us another room - but it only had one double bed (the other was missing) and when I brought him into show him that one of the beds was gone, he said that this \"must be the room with the leak\" and showed me the ceiling was falling in over the \"missing\" bed. We finally got a room that was \"clean enough\" and he promised to bring the crib. We waited another half hour with our exhausted child crying because she didn't have a bed. I finally called the front desk and was told that he couldn't find a crib and he'd tried to reach all the managers to see where they were stored, but they were unavailable. So my wife put the baby in her bed and we attempted to sleep - it was a long, restless night as the noises from the hall and a toddler used to her own bed kept us awake most of the night. The next morning I asked to speak to the manager about the issues. He told me that he already knew about them and was unwilling to discuss. He put the blame on the desk clerk, who was working his second week at the hotel. I asked if it was a smart choice to have this new person working on such a busy weekend. He then told me that he worked until well after midnight and had stayed on-site overnight to help with the crowd. I couldn't believe that he would tell me this with the problems that we encountered starting at 11:15PM. I told him that I hadn't stayed in a La Quinta in about 20 years and I wouldn't be staying in one in the future and inexplicably he said \"that's good.\" I don't know if he was trying to be dismissive or was just very nervous. He was obviously uncomfortable discussing any of the problems with me (and yes, I remained calm and civil) and told me to leave - \"things were taken care of.\" I asked what that meant and he said that \"nothing will appear on your card\" and waved me away with the back of his hand. No apologies, no comments, nothing - just - shooed me away. In short - the worst hotel experience that I've had in a long, long time.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "TN", "Title": "\u201cOne of the nicer LaQuinta Inns\u201d", "Author": "tammyssong", "ReviewID": "UR7999241", "Content": "We typically like to stay at more upscale hotels when on vacation but we stayed at this LaQuinta while moving our family from MN to TN.

We stayed there 1 night and was one of the worst hotels I've been in. Upon check-in we heard the person in front of us complaining about a gnat problem in their room and was upset. The clerk basically blew him off and just said that it happens when it rains...which it had rained earlier that day. That should have been our sign to just go find another hotel! We checked into our room and it was basically as expected-- nothing special, but gives you a place to sleep. As the night goes on, we keep noticing more big black bugs crawling around. I'd finally had enough when I go to get a pillow out of the bed and the bug is crawling on the pillow and another one on the comforter! I go complain to the front desk and they say they can move us to another room. It is 3am at this time and some people in our room were already sleeping. They decided to stay in the bug room, but 2 of us did not want to sleep in the bed with bugs crawling all over so moved to the new room. As we are walking to the new room, we see more of the same bugs in the hallway, so not sure this next one will be any better! The next day they insist on charging us for BOTH rooms because we split up and 2 girls stayed asleep in the original room. Their customer service was absolutely horrible and all of their explanations on why charging us for both rooms ran in circles. All I know is that I was NOT staying in a room with bugs in the bed and I should not have to pay for the bug-free room I moved to. There are too many other options of hotels to stay at in Champaign, so I will not be returning here or to any La Quinta.

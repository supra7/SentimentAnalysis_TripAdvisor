I knew about the construction before I arrived and it really did not hinder my stay in any way. The room that I was in had not yet been renovated. It was clean but needed an upgrade. However, I noticed when I arrived that the clock in the bedroom had not been reset for daylight savings time. I asked to have it fixed (You need a screwdriver to open it up in order to change the time, so I could not do it myself). When I arrived back several hours later, the time had not been fixed so I called again and they finally sent someone up. However, the more important issue was the lock - or rather the lack of one. I happened to notice that the sliding door onto the outside balcony had no inside handle and no lock. Even though it was 2 stories up from the roof below, this was a little disconcerting since I am female and was staying alone. I reported it as I was leaving the hotel for my class and they said that they would have someone from enginerring look at it right away. When I arrived back late that night, nothing had been done. There was still no handle and still no lock. But it was late and I was tired so I waited until the next day to reported it again. They finally sent someone up and he screwed a small screw into the sliding side near where it meets the other one. So in theory the door could only be opened a few inches. However, this was a small screw and with any sort of strength, I'm sure someone could have been slammed it open and the screw would either fall out or snap off. I should have insisted that they move me to another room, but I didn't. It seems strange to me that I had 2 issues and both times it took 2 reports before they resolved the issues. In a service industry, the main concern should be keeping the customers happy.

As someone who has stayed at Embassy Suites across the country, I was really dissapointed with the quality of this property. We chose this particular property based on it's proximity to the zoo and the indoor pool. We checked out for the following reasons: the indoor pool was filthy, you could clearly see a dirt trail from where the water came into the pool, down the wall, and all along the bottom. The area around the pool felt dirty and seemed to be mildewed. The hotel has a very dated appearance on the outside and feels like it could use a major overhaul on the inside as well. The carpets in our room were dirty and had a cigarette burn. The tv's and furnishings are ancient. The food at breakfast was well below Embassy standards - the potatoes were hardly cooked, pancakes and eggs tasted weird and were not replenished frequently. We chose to stay at the Hilton Anatole and ended up paying less even after paying for parking and adding in the breakfast buffet. The Anatole is an amzing property and it's just right down the street.

If this were a discount chain I would understand the lack of service and quality, but not an Embassy Suites. The entire building is old and it shows. One of the four elevators is broken (and in nine days I never saw anyone working on it), and another one worked only occasionally. The carpets are all worn, the TVs are old and only have roughly fifteen channels, and the locks on one of my bathroom's door didn't work. If you need to use the internet here, best of luck to you! If you pay for WiFi, it works sometimes in the lobby but rarely in a room, and the businesses center's two computers are slower than dial up and time you out after ten minutes. At one point, I came back to my room after a long day to find a giant wet spot in the middle of the floor. After calling the front desk, they eventually sent a service man. His solution to the problem? Using all my clean towels to dry up the mystery water on the floor overnight and not replacing them. Speaking of the front desk, the service is terrible. When your phone does work, good luck getting them to ever pick up. If you do happen to get through and ask for a wake up call, your chance of actually getting one is only 50%. Some of the employees at the front desk are very rude. Don't eat at the in-house restaurant, Pollo Rose. The servers are slow and the food sub par and overpriced. Since the nearest DART stop is inaccessible (across an eight lane highway), you have to use the shuttle service to get anywhere if you don't have a car. If you do, make sure you ask for the driver named Darnell! He is ultra courteous, timely, and will go far out of his way to help you out. Additionally, the man who works at the breakfast station making cooked-to-order omelets is quick and entertaining. Even on a busy weekend in the mid-morning, I never had to wait in line more than five minutes. Overall, I think you can find better service for what you will pay.

Sleep quality. If you stay here, expect to hear the constant rattle of the freeway and the televisions on either side of your room. Even if you move to the couch, you can expect to hear noise from the atrium. I do not think the noise from the other rooms was excessively loud, rather the noise was due to thin walls. 2. Connection to guest services/front desk from room. On four different occasions, I tried to phone guest services from my bedroom. Other colleagues tried to phone guest services as well, and no one ever picked up. We learned to walk to the front desk to ask our question. Even then, guest services did not always follow through. One evening at about 6pm, I walked to the front desk to ask for an extra blanket and lotion (as the maid never left any in my room until the last day I was there); the person at the front desk gave me some lotion and told me the blanket would be sent shortly. I waited two hours, but the blanket never arrived. 3. Rooms. My room looked like it was damaged from a boy band party. The bathroom door was clawed at the base, there were multiple stains on the carpet, and some of the furniture was dented. Old florescent lighting overhead. 4. Shuttle. Make sure you reserve the shuttle well in advance; otherwise, you may need to arrange a taxi or will have to wait a long time. 5. Business center has sloooow computers, and if you wish to access the internet from your room, prepare to pay $10/day. 6. Restaurant menus - greasy food. Not many healthy options. You can probably find better, healthier options at Whataburger or Subway, which are within walking distance. I have stayed in the Market Center district on other occasions and can recommend better hotels within a two-mile radius.

Our room was on the west side of the hotel and the freeway noise was very noticeable in the bedroom even though we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t directly facing the freeway. The noise was loud because the balcony sliding glass doors leak air. The doors were permanently locked sometime in the past and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be opened. There was a significant breeze coming from between the 2 doors and more important than the freeway noise was the cold outside air! If the doors are pressed together by hand the cold air AND the freeway noises are greatly reduced. The thermostat does not have a temperature setting. If you find the temperature cold or hot you move the dial up or down. Our main reason for seeking an Embassy Suites hotel was the indoor pool for our kids. The pool was average Embassy Suites style and packed with kids. There were only 3 tables with chairs. The kids said the pool was warm the first day and cold the second. The thermostat on the wall indicated 79 the first day and 73 the second. The colder air temperature made the overwhelming chlorine smell more tolerable on the second day.

We decided to stay here because we knew they offer a complimentary breakfast and there would be a lot of room for the four of us to spread out. There were good and bad things about our stay, but overall it was fine for our purposes. And most of the bad things aren't so bad unless you are pretty picky. Bad things: 1) the carpet looked pretty dirty and was well worn down. However, my daughter walked around the room with white socks on and they didn't get pick up dirt so it was clean enough. It's just a bad first impression. 2) The cold water tap in the sink in the kitchenette area didn't work (hot water tap did work), but there are two other sinks in the room to use so that didn't bother us and we didn't call for someone to fix it. 3) The bathroom was small, but if you just needed a sink, there are two others in the room. 4) One problem they need to fix is that our bathroom had no towel bars. It seemed strange to me that they offer the \"hang up the towels to conserve laundry waste\" option, but don't have anyplace to hang them up. There is a hook behind the bathroom door, but it certainly wouldn't hold four towels. The shower curtain rod was fine for hanging up wet swimsuits - until someone wanted to take a shower. And because the rod curves out beyond the actual tub, anything that drips will drip on the floor. 5) The sofabed was thin (3-4\" thick or so) and was uneven, but the way it opened up it was raised at the head, like a hospital bed. My children (ages 12 and 8) loved it because it was easier to watch t.v. that way. As for comfort, they had no complaints, but then they can sleep in airplane seats with no complaints either. I didn't even try it out because I have a bad hip, but I think for the kids it is a novelty. Adults might not think it too wonderful. 6) Our room was facing a major highway, IH-35. The noise from the traffic created some background noise. I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me, but if you need it silent you should ask for a room opposite the highway. 7) At the breakfast buffet, the glasses for beverages were dirty from the manager's reception the night before. The glass I grabbed had margarita salt and lipstick still on it. Use the styrofoam cups they provide. 8) I didn't see anyplace to grab a bite nearby except a Whataburger just north of the hotel. Except for breakfast we ate away from the hotel anyway. We did order Domino's pizza the first night and they delivered no problem. You could probably ask the front desk for other options, and there is also room service. Good things: 1) The room has lots of storage and lots of space. There is an armoir in the bedroom, shelves in each of the two t.v. cabinets, a shelf under the sink in the bathroom and the kitchenette. The room was a good size. Even with the sofabed open, there was room to move around without banging into furniture. 2) For our family of four, the complimentary breakfast was a huge convenience and what sold us on the hotel. Go early to avoid the long lines at the hot breakfast counter (omelets and pancakes). We went there at 7:30 and there were only 3 people in line in front of us. On another day we got there at 9am and the line had 12 people. But there are other things to eat if you don't want to wait: hot oatmeal with toppings you can add in; cereal (Total, Corn Flakes, Fruit Loops & Frosted Flakes) and milk; fresh fruit (whole apples and oranges, cubed cantaloupe and honeydew); pastries; rolls; bread for toast (wheat and white); yogurt; muffins; standard beverages like OJ, apple juice, and coffee. 3) Since the hotel is right off IH-35, it's easy to hop on the highway to get to where you need to go. We went sightseeing all around the city so it was a convenient starting point. 4) The kitchenette was a bonus for us. The fridge was small, but held all our Thanksgiving leftovers (Maggiano's was fabulous!)plus sodas and water. There is a small microwave and coffemaker with coffee and tea provided. The dining table in the room was a convenient place to eat, use the laptop, dump off our packages, and to sit and hang out together.

Only white wine was Chardonnay even though popular variaties like Pinot Grigio would not cost them any more. Left and went to the reg. bar. Bartender was a bit weird and poured as little as possible, but was acceptable. Oddly the price for drinks was different each day. On Saturday an new bartender told my wife in seconds that they were out of Pinot Grigio!!! On the week-end??We left. Another customer walked in one night and bought a beer because they ran out of comp. Bud Lite and would not get anymore. Maybe that is part of their game plan?

They had a check-in/out kiosk at the front desk - if you used it for either, you should get 500 HHonors points each time. Great idea - haven't gotten the points yet though. The kiosk was useful if there was a line waiting to check in, but it would have been faster to check in at the front desk than using the kiosk. Check out was pretty quick.

This is a very old style Embassy Suites and the rooms are tired and outdated. The location is directly on the freeway with no restaurants neaby. My room was very noisy due to road noise and I did not sleep well. I enquired at 7:30am the next morning if I could change to a room in the back but was told that the hotel was fully booked (I don't believe it given the parking lot). Anyway, they oould have offered to switch me to a room in the back later that day when something opened up or at least check their computer. Instead, they didn't offer anything. I asked to speak to the manager and the Hhonors manager but was told they were not in and unavailable. So, I told the front desk I'd be back in five minutes, went up to my room and threw everything in the suitcase and came back down to check out. I later called the Hhonors customer service to register my complaint and to their credit they removed the one night's room charge from my account.", "Date": "September 10, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Hotel Dallas-Market Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98647-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Hotel_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$106 - $214*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2727 Stemmons Freeway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75207</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "98647", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bc/c5/bcc5ee3ffe389a634a2a063c06aa579a5large.jpg"}}

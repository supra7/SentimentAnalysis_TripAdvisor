Front desk staff was courteous and not overly friendly, as many a Chicagoan are, just enough to give you the basics. Housekeeping was good, everything was cleaned each afternoon I came back. Location is within a block off the Magnificent Mile/N Michigan Ave at the corner of XXI, Gap, and Guess. It is very near original Pizzeria Unos, original Billy Goat, 10-15min walk to Navy Pier, 10-15min walk to Millennium Park/Art Institute, 20-30min walk to Sears/Willis Tower, 5min walk to Hancock Observatory/Water Tower. I didn't drive, so from O hare by the blue line it will take about an hour plus 10-15min walk to hotel.

Our room had two queen beds that were adorned with fresh white linens, and the room also had a nice armoire for storing any clothing as needed. The bathroom seemed to be newly updated, it had a new vanity which was nice, and it was clean. We also received a free drink ticket at the bar in the lobby upon check-in which was a nice bonus as well since drinks downtown can get pretty spendy. The only downfall of our room was, the windows had little grates in them so it kind of made it seem like a cell of some sort, but it wasn't a huge deal since we weren't planning on sitting in the room staring out the windows, anyways.

We contacted the hotel at about 9am and asked to either cancel the room or reserve it for the following day instead. We explained the situation and we were simply told \"sorry, there is nothing we can do for you\". They hung up and that was the end of it.

This hotel works out great if you are planning a trip that revolves around the shopping on Michigan Ave. It's a bit further from the CTA EL lines than we like but there are plenty of mass transit options along Michigan Ave 1 block away. The room we stayed had a living area and a bedroom that could be closed off for privacy. The bathroom was a bit cramped so if you are planning a longer stay or have more than 2 in this room it would be best to check with the hotel directly about other room types. Our room on the 6th floor did get a bit of road and pedestrian noise but not uncomfortable for us. Request a higher floor if possible. The lobby was inviting and there was direct access to LaVazza coffee. Great if the weather is bad. On the 22nd floor there is a rooftop deck with some pretty good views of the city. Walk directly east from the hotel and you can access the Lakefront path via a tunnel under Lake Shore Drive. The hotel parking garage is located 1 block down and across the street but for a better value we opted to park at the surface lot on the south side of Illinois Ave at St Clair at $28 for a 24 hour period. It's an easy 2 block walk directly south of the hotel along St Clair. You'll save $8 by walking 1 block farther on the same street. We enjoyed the stay with the exception of the really noisy sheets.

There were people from all over the world staying at the hotel. The first thing I noticed when I walked in the room, was a very strong and nasty smell of cigarette smoke. Yughhh!!! I called front desk and a housekeeping person showed up immediately and sprayed the entire room and bathroom. However, when the scent of the spray wore off, the cigarette smell came back just as strong. I covered the vents in the bathroom with a towel, and still I was getting the smell. It was so bad, I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning, I personally went to the front desk and complained. The gentleman at the front desk was very honest, apologized, and told me there was nothing that could be done, other than to call security, to possibly find out who the smoker was. I was later told that the hotel is non-smoking, however, some guests decide to take liberties and break rules, thus ruining other people's stay. It's sad that because of these unruly people, I must give an average review of the hotel. I review hotels based on if I had a comfortable experience or not. In this case it's a negative :-( However, I must acknowledge that it was not the hotel's fault. We had issues with the internet in the room. This was a major issue!!!!

The location is great, just a half block east of Michigan Avenue. Arriving at rush hour on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, there were A LOT of people on the streets. Alan greeted us warmly and even conveyed a bit of humor, as I told him it was crazy outside, he said \"I assure you, we are very sane in here.\" He was friendly, and even took a moment to find out about us, which you don't necessarily find these days. He upgraded our prepaid Queen bed room to a King corner suite on the 17th floor, which he did at no charge, since the hotel was not full, and it was around a holiday. It seems there is a lot of variability in room sizes, but we found the King corner room to be VERY spacious, and overall one of the nicer rooms we have stayed at in quite some time. The heating/cooling unit had some difficulty maintaining a set temperature (e.g. you set it for 68 and suddenly it is 75 degrees in the room), but the room never felt too hot or too cold. The bathroom is somewhat small, which many people seem to gripe about, but it is more than adequate for what a bathroom is--a tub/shower, toilet, and sink! I found it cute, and it was definitely clean and updated. There are 3 elevators that are smaller, 4 person elevators, but it didn't seem to be an issue in terms of access, except for certain times of the day (e.g. mid-morning and checkout time). There is a great Lavazza coffee shop that is connected to the hotel and opens at 6:00 a.m., and they serve breakfast and lunch sandwiches, among other things. The most striking thing about our stay was when we were leaving--the housekeeper thanked us for staying there, and that is something I have NEVER experienced at a hotel before!

The decor could do with being updated to come in line with the reception but it was still fine. The bed was comfy, the aircon unit kept the room warm once I worked out how to use it, making sure I never got cold.

The lift music is something that could also do with being updated, but thats just nitpicking!

I am appalled that when there was an issue with the card instead of trying to contact me and get it worked out they just deactivated our key cards with all of our stuff still in the room. As I sat at the front desk on the phone with the card company the front desk staff was very rude and not very willing to help me straighten out the issue. The lady on the phone asked if she could speak with the front desk staff to get this issue resolved and the front desk staff said \"no, I can't talk to them because I am not a manager.\" I then had to ask the front desk staff if they could go get the manager so they could talk to them. Meanwhile, my husband offered our personal card and asked the front desk staff to run it for ONE NIGHT so we could get some rest and deal with the company card issue the following morning. The front desk staff ran our card and said it wouldn't work. We found that odd because our card should have more than accepted one night at this hotel but there was nothing we could do. After a 45-min. fight I got things straightened out with my company card and we were finally allowed back up to our room. The following morning we got a call from our bank wanting to approve a charge for ALL 4 NIGHTS at the hotel! We immediately told them we would not approve that charge because we had already put it on my company card. On top of the nightmare on the day we checked in: -Our \"city-view room\" was a room with a window that had the wall of another building 10-ft. in front of it. If you went to the far left-side of the window and looked all the way to the right you could see a few more buildings. -The elevators were slow as molasses and had awful music playing in them, another hotel guest that we didn't know referred to it as cruel and unusual punishment. -There was only wifi in the lobby and they charged $10/day if you want it in your room. -The sheets on the bed felt like a mixture of plastic and paper. I woke up every single time my husband rolled over and rustled the sheets. -The tv is set on a dresser that is so low to the ground you can barely see it over the end of the bed. -The hotel staff said nothing about the Skyline Terrace...the only reason I knew about it is because I looked it up before we got there. Granted the location was good with it being very close to shopping and restaurants and the concierges were always very helpful I would not stay in this hotel again nor would I recommend that anyone stay at this hotel. I saw way too many hotels in that area and think you can get a lot more for the amount paid at this hotel.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cGood location but prepare for service below the average\u201d", "Author": "mapny", "ReviewID": "UR119376264", "Content": "I have reserved the room from this hotel through Bank of America Chicago Marathon event organizer so I expected the hotel will be prepared for people who will come to hotel for the marathon that guests want to rest as much as possible before the D-Day.

I like my friend, but not that much! when we told the guy at the front desk we had booked two beds and we also had it on our email confirmation he said \"oh those confirmations can be misleading.\" Um, how so? If I book and pay for something then that is what I am expecting to get. The rooms are TINY and the bathroom is as well. There was hair on the bathroom floor when we got there as well as a massive one in the bathtub and the walls and doors desperately need a paint job. There is nowhere to store anything in the bathrooms. Our bed was VERY soft -so much so that our backs hurt in the morning. The biggest issue we had was the sheet on the bed. It did not fit! I only went to the end of the mattress but did not go over the end. We accepted this for night one and then night two complained. The manager was very nice and had it fixed for us for night two. Night three it was back to the short sheet (they dont use fitted sheets!) and the top sheet had dried blood on it and so for night four I complained again and got it fixed by a woman with no teeth who was shouting at me in spanish! The elevator is TINY so you often have to wait for a few runs to get on one. Especially in the morning as we waited almost 20 minutes for one with our luggage. There are no fridges in the room which I was annoyed about but I guess there is nowhere to put one! The in room iron left a mark on my friends new shirt. They are VERY skimpy on supplies. For two females staying there, they gave us one bar of soap (which we used for the handsink) as well as two small bath towels and a foot towel.

The rooms were roomy and clean and the rooftop terrace was especially nice. Now, the last time we were in Chicago we stayed at the Marriott (which is almost directly across the street). This hotel is not the Marriott but we didn't expect it to be. In fact, some of my party liked this hotel better and it does have a certain charm that the big fancy places can lack. Some reviewers have complained about the front desk staff, and while they were not overly friendly, they certainly were not rude and were attentive whenever needed. Other reviewers have complained about the elevators. There are two small elevators so they fill up quickly and often one has to wait, but our wait was never so long that it was annoying.

There are a couple of shelves I utilized to put our toiletries on, as there isn't a vanity. Toilet worked fine. Hot water and a good shower head. The best kept secret here is the rooftop lounge on the 22nd floor. Patio furniture, sofas, great nighttime views of the city! Our only complaint was that housekeeping forgot to make up our room one day. I called the desk and they said they would send someone. I asked where we should go while the room was being cleaned (9:45pm), they just said it would be taken care of. We waited in the lobby for 30 minutes while the room was cleaned.

Pool and Hot tub were very nice, Workout room was nice but limited to 1 each on equipment so get there early or late to avoid waiting. View from roof nice. Concierge was knowledgeable. Price was UNBELIEVABLE for downtown Chicago. Only downsides: 1. Bathrooms were very small. No shelves or places to sit toiletries at all. Would recommend this addition. 2. Concierge: While helpful, hard to find. We had to go find him 3 times as he was literally NEVER at his station. I'd recommend some type of paging button for him, or an automated concierge screen with recommended restaurants, printable maps, site seeing tours, etc. 3. Elevators: room for 2 with luggage. 4.

We also walked to some of the popular tourist atractions including the Hancock Building, Water Tower Place, Navy Pier, Millennium park, etc. When we were too cold to walk, we took taxis (PS: I think Chicago has the cheapest taxis. The four of us never paid more than $20 to go anywhere, including the tip!). The hotel building itself looks small as it is nestled between buildings. The lobby of the hotel was super-cute, trendy and modern. The elevators worked well and we never had to wait to go to and from our room. Our hotel room had two queen beds and the bathroom was pretty small, but the four of us (yes, four of us) managed to get ready every day and night without any problems. House-keeping was awesome as they cleaned our room every day and took out all of our trash (we were messy as we had Chicago pizza delivered to our room from Gino's). They also promptly brought us numerous sets of towels when we called for them. Lastly, the hotel bar was nice...small, but perfet to grab a quick drink on your way out for the night.

Many trips to Chicago, but our first stay here. A great rate was offered, so we decided to give it a try. The overriding aspect of our stay was one others have already written about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LOCATION. It is EXCELLENT!!! So easy to get to all the to-do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on our list. Besides being so close to the Mag Mile, it is right in the center of spots to the north and the south. Easy walks to the Water Tower and Hancock in one direction\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6then to the Art Institute, the Cultural Center and all of the Loop in the other. Just a few blocks to Navy Pier too. (Loved the stained-glass exhibit!) Really, just ideal for us. As said above, this trip was holiday-themed. We did a lot in 2 days, and especially enjoyed seeing as many Christmas decorations as we could. What we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do was go to Chicago to spend our fun time staying inside the hotel. I honestly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you any helpful info about the lobby or the bar, though we saw they have both. We only dealt with 2 hotel employees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the desk clerk and the 12th floor maid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they were both very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable, sufficiently roomy, with new foam-topped mattresses and very inviting pillows and quilts - also an in-room coffee maker, a huge plus for us. As said before, the bathrooms are small, but so what? We easily did all there might be to do in them. (OK, gotta admit - sometimes we laugh at certain criticisms here on TA, and this was one of them). One more thing about the quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we always travel with earplugs for sleeping in case there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need them at the Inn.

I visit Chicago quite often, and have seen this hotel before on other trips to the downtown area. I found a great deal on Hotels.com so I decided to try the Inn of Chicago for my next business trip. WOW!!!! This hotel is certainly a hidden gem in downtown Chicago, and is a quick half block from all the excitement, wonderful shopping and restaurants of Michigan avenue. So, you can't beat the great location. I was also impressed by the decor (very modern and chic, but not stuffy and snooty like some upscale hotels can be.) When I arrived, the staff was VERY helpful and friendly, and checking in was a breeze! They offer free wi-fi in the hotel lobby, but you must pay $9.95 (for 24 hours of access) if you want to have the convenience of wi-fi in your hotel room. In terms of parking, the hotel does not have an attached parking garage. But there is a parking garage located around the corner (very short walking distance) where guests can park for $41 (valet) or $36 (self-park). They also offered a FREE wine and cheese managers reception on the night I arrived! The room I stayed in was very nice. I must admit the room was a bit small (certainly not a shoebox!), but could easily and comfortably accommodate two people. There was ample storage/closet space, a nice-sized desk, and flat panel TV. The only downside to the room I stayed in (in my personal opinion) was the view (small window in room) and the small size of the bathroom. I stayed on the 19th floor and had a view of the neighboring condo building across the street. But, I could still see portions of the magnificent mile down below. Likewise, the bathroom was quite small (reminded me of being in Europe), but was still very functional, and again, the decor was very modern. If you are a person that needs and/or likes a lot of bathroom space, then you should probably consider another hotel. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at the Inn of Chicago. I wish I would have stayed here sooner during my many trips to the windy city! But now I know better, and I would certainly stay here again.

The elevator carpet is worn, paint chipped everywhere, and hallways REEK of old smoke and dust (just replace the carpets). The rooms are, in a word, appalling. If you're expecting even a hint of luxury you will NOT find it here. It was the kind of room one would expect to find at a roadside chain. Small, dark, old, chipped furniture all of which showed it's age. The exterior windows were so dirty it was almost impossible to see out of one of them. The guest spaces need total refurbishment. The bathroom was tiny, the small sink was a joke and the bath products, again, are consistent with a roadside chain. The only saving grace was that the bed was comfortable. As one other reviewer put it - installing some glass shelves and a flat screen does not a high-end hotel make. That sums up the guest room experience. I appreciate guest services getting back to fellow reviewers here to thank them for comments or suggest calling the front desk about problems on their next stay but the issues with this hotel can't be fixed by guest services.

If a large bathroom is important to you, this is not the hotel for you. Especially if you plan to have more than 2 people in the room and if travelling with children that require assistance in the bathroom it is not the hotel for you. The bathroom is tastefully decorated with glass shelves on the wall for storage. The desk and mirror in the bedroom provided a vanity makeup area. If you are looking for ambiance whatever the hotel is lacking in bathroom space it makes up for with the wonderful deck on the 22nd floor. Sit in a relaxing patio chair or couch and enjoy the views of the city or the sun going down.

We woke up in the night several times alternating from uncomfortably warm to overly cool. While we could not hear noise from the rooms on either side of ours the hallway noise was another issue. The doors to the rooms closed very hard and loudly. This sound carried into our room. Upon checking out there were 3 people behind the counter two of which were doing nothing.

What was the best was the location .. one block from Michigan Ave and the number of restaurants in the area really madeit a great vacation. It is also a like fifteen minutes walking to the peer where everything is happening . For breakfast I suggest you go the West Egg ( couple of blocks) just ask the desk in the front for directions. We went to Frontera Grill and followed the advice of others of going in at five and getting your name on the list....we did not have to wait as we decided to eat at the bar .. which is my type of place .. We also ate ate at Webers Grill and Texas from Brazil ( this is an all you can eat meat place, what attracted me was the salad bar ,,which is excelent ..cost per person if $45..but if you are a big eater the food was very good. We also ate at Ron of Japan and we were pleasently surprised as well as a small Tai restaurant after Ron of Japan that was really good. Tip: We bought our GO CHICAGO on the internet for three days and what I liked is that it included everything imaginable museums, bike rides, 3 sailing trips .. for $97 per person so it is the way to go .. For the night entertainment we went to Chicago Blues .. it is vey small and just a place to drink and hear blues ..the music was fantastic so we had a great time ..fee was $10 per person what a bargain for great music ! We also went to a jazz place nearby and entry was 15.00 with live music..

There's a gourmet cafe serving Italian coffee located in the lobby and a 7-11 across the street. They had free WiFi in the lobby (the InterContinental where our friends stayed, did not have free WiFi) The staff were friendly and efficient. The Not So Good This was no 5-star hotel. We knew that going in. Normally I take photos of the hotel rooms and post them. This time, I was unimpressed and didn't bother taking any. The room needed some TLC. It's true, the rooms are small and the bathroom even smaller, like a closet. You can sit on the toilet and brush your teeth at the same time. For 2 people, it felt cramped. A few things to note: located near the Magnificent Mile aka Michigan Avenue, there will be lots of traffic in the lobby. There was a baseball game that weekend, so there were a lot of visiting fans. Any hotel located on Michigan Ave will be busy. Second, they have small elevators. You will wait a while during peak periods. So FYI. The A/C was on full blast and was a bit noisy. We couldn't adjust it, but if you're a heavy sleeper, this shouldn't be an issue. So would I recommend this hotel? Yes, if you're staying a few days and the basics are good enough for you.

CTA buses to almost every tourist destination stop only a block away: #151 to Union station and Lincoln Park Zoo, #146 to the museum campus (Field, Adler, Shedd), #10 (seasonal) to the Museum of Science & Industry and Hyde Park (University of Chicago), and numerous routes up and down Michigan Avenue and State Street. The red line subway station at north State and Grand Streets is just four blocks away, and this connects (usually via stairs) to all the elevated trains, including the blue line to O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare airport and the orange line to Midway airport. A CTA 3 day (72 hour) pass for all the above bus and train and subway routes costs only $14 for unlimited rides. Weekly and daily passes are also available at most train stations and other locations (see the CTA web site). Because older hotels often have variable-sized rooms, we were happy to be given two double beds rather than one king. Our room was about 12x20 feet including the bathroom, and had an armoire, a chest of drawers, a table with two dining chairs (rather than a desk), an LCD TV, an iron and board, and a coffee maker. Coffee packets are complimentary, but rumor has it that the bottled water is costly. Our room was pleasantly decorated and in good condition. We had asked for a room with a view when confirming our reservation, but we were given a view of the fire escape (rooms --23), presumably because we were Priceline.com bidding clients who paid a discounted rate (about 45% below the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rack rate, and 35% below the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior rate for our mid-week-dates). This was a disappointment but not a security problem, because the windows were painted shut and contained wire security mesh within the glass (fire escape access was via the hallway next to our room). Judging from the fire plan, only the larger west-facing rooms have unobstructed views. Other rooms appear to face buildings across the three surrounding streets. But there is a nice open roof terrace on floor 22 for everyone to use. This is a great place to bring a snack and use the free wi-fi (which is $10 per day in the guest rooms). As noted by most previous reviewers, the bathrooms are quite small (about 5x5 feet, less than my arm span in each direction) but are renovated and functional. The one drawback is that the single sink is a fashionable table-top style, but the table extends a third of the way across the bathroom entry. People with mobility or width issues need not apply, and others should beware of stubbed toes. There is no bathroom counter, but there are two glass shelves for toiletries. Most important, bedding is top quality and climate control works well. The beds have pillow-top mattresses with double-sheeted duvets and more pillows than one would ever need. The climate control is a window-unit with digital controls. Since the windows do not open and the weather was cool, we preferred to cool the room each time we returned, then just run the fan on low with the vent open overnight. Because the hotel does not have its own restaurant, room service, or business center, it usually loses a half or a whole star in most booking engine rating systems, but we need none of those. Judging by the numerous tourists staying there (many apparently from Europe), these are not missed. On both sides of the hotel are numerous restaurants, some of which deliver (at prices well below most room service menus). One block east and south is a large Dominick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarket where we got rotisserie chicken, fruit, bakery & deli items, and wine. A few blocks west and north is a Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, for more exotic grocery fare. We usually visit Chicago a few times a year for shopping, concerts, and museums. We will happily add the Inn of Chicago to our options when selecting our hotel in the future. It is not as fancy as the Hyatt where we have stayed in the past, but we were just as happy at the Inn of Chicago.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cInn Of Chicago - Great Value, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "DonNewYorkCity", "ReviewID": "UR66881123", "Content": "We stayed for five nights recently, and we were satisfied with The Inn of Chicago.

Also someone at the front desk activated our neighbors card for our room. So when their room key didn't work they walked into ours. That could have been really bad! After that my room key wouldn't work! So I took it down to get it reactivated and then my brother who was with me, his didn't work. So we went and got his reactivated.

We arrived in Chicago around 1030 am so I called and ask for an early check in. After being hung up own twice I finally spoke to someone who said that rooms would be available around 1 but we could leave our bags. That was fine we did that and had lunch. Around 1230 we can back to the hotel to wait ti check in. After watching several people being told no you cant check in a gentleman walks in off the street books a room and is allowed to check in . This of course angers me because her we have reservation already and are made to wait.I am thinking we are sitting in front of you waiting you could have said your room is ready. I approached the counter and she gladly checked up in. The first room looked as if it hadnt been clean at all there was fecal matter in the toliet and trash in the garbage can and used soap on the sink. I called down and was given a new room and it was worse than the first. If the surrounding hotels werent 4 times as much I would have left. stopped the maid and showed her the bathroom and she told me that there were just stains on the toilet. I was stunned so I took a picture and took it to the front desk. The desk agent called the major. He was very pleasant and sent the staff up to properly clean the room and offer to have our bags transferred.

When we arrived in the room, it was clean except for a hunk of some type of chocolate (I hope) on the bedspread. We tossed the bedspread aside and didn't use it. On New Year's Eve, all hotel guests were required to have a wristband to gain access to the property. I understand and appreciate the security, but we were given bright pink, paper wristbands most often used by those college-aged bars. It was New Year's and we were dressed in suits, going to a nice dinner and here we were with bright pink paper wristbands like we had been at a spring break frat party. Good idea, but better execution please! The hotel gym was moved to the 3rd level, but the book in the room still said 15th floor. Overall, we had a good stay. Sure, there were a few annoyances, but the location, the price (we paid approximately $79 per night) and the quality were good. I would recommend this hotel to others who want to stay near Michigan Ave and not pay the ridiculous prices of most hotels in that area.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cGreat location with a comfortable bed\u201d", "Author": "Yen_8", "ReviewID": "UR52603505", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights over the new year period.

I booked through expedia and a few days later I called to verify my reservation as I always do when I travel. Of three phone calls, two of the representatives told me my room had NOT been paid for when in fact, I had already paid through Expedia and the charge was on my credit card. Another time, I was transferred to the front desk and they told me my room was paid for. I told them I didn't want to have any issues when I check in. I used the customer service address on their website and sent the hotel an e-mail asking about refrigerators and credit card authorization form (I let my husband have the credit card that weekend) and I never got a response after a few days, so I called the front desk and they faxed a credit card authorization form, I faxed it back with a note asking to please call me when they receive it. Never received a call back, so I took a hard copy of the form to Chicago with me. When I arrived, they did have my form with the instructions to call me on the form, but I guess that wasn't very important! Where do the email messages go? And why didn't someone call me? The lobby of the hotel is lovely - the elevators are small but decent and fairly quick. The room was OK - I was actually expecting the worst since the rate was so low, but the room was very basic, with beds above normal quality. Furniture, TV, etc were basic. Room was on the small side, but definitely not a problem and comfortable for two people. We were lucky to have a corner room at the very end of the 14th floor. We had two windows and one faced busy Michigan Aveue and the other faced high-rise condos next door and was directly above one of my favorite Chicago restaurants - Sayat Nova Armenian Cuisine! Three things really irked me about the stay: a) The bathroom was small but that's fine...but I don't remember the last time I was in a hotel bathroom that didn't have a fan for ventilation. Just a basic light. So no fan to help with steam during showers and to help cover sounds and smells (hey, we were eating all kinds of great food on our trip). Plus, we could hear very clearly the people who were either in the bathroom across the hall or above us through the vent. We could hear their TV and we could hear the girls chit-chatting as they got dressed for the night. Very clearly! So they could probably hear us take showers or pee! And then b) The hallway on the 14th floor - I don't think it was vacuumed once during our 3 nights there. The same threads and bits of paper were on the ratty carpet the whole time we were there. The ratty carpet made me fear the worst as we approached our room, but the room wasn't ratty like the hallway was, fortunately! It was obvious that we were put on a crappier floor because we visited the 22nd floor terrace and you could tell those rooms were nicer - the carpet was new and vacuumed on that floor, and the doors themselves were renovated and shiny with a wood-stain finish. But again, I don't mind because we had such a great rate in such a great location. c) Every time I went to the desk from check in, to requesting directions to asking for a late check-out, there wasn't anyone there, and I had to cough or knock on the desk or make some sort of sound so that the person in the back room would notice I was there. I presume there must be a camera so the attendants can monitor the desk, but if not, someone should be posted to be there so people don't have to wait. Keep in mind the hotel has no frills - no room service or food available at night. There is a business center (computer kiosk) that charges about $5 per 15 minutes of internet access. There is a workout room. An independently managed bar off of the lobby but they don't have food. There is also a Lavazza cafe located off the lobby but after they close, no food options. But that's okay because you're in downtown CHICAGO and there is food and shopping everywhere. Despite my little issues, I'd definitely stay here again. The rate I booked on expedia was about 50% off the rate they promoted on their website and it was an absolute steal. Would I pay full price for these rooms, no. But I will definitely look on Expedia for this specific hotel next time I go to Chicago, which will probably be within the next month. This hotel is half a block off of Michigan Avenue, next to Eddie Bauer, the Gap, Guess?, Forever21 and a movie theatre. Within walking to all Michigan Avenue shops, different churches, and you can walk to Navy Pier, etc. An amazing steal for those who are budget-conscious and don't need anything fancy.

Nice top-floor terrace with a good view (although the hours weren't great -- it closed at 10pm). One big drawback was no free WiFi in the rooms -- you had to go down to the lobby, which was usually filled with other guests doing the same thing. Particularly bothersome was that you could not get WiFi reception in the hotel bar, which was just a few feet away from the lobby. The room was clean and the maid service was good. The TV was an old CRT and the picture was a little fuzzy. The room is on the smaller side, and the bathroom is really tiny. We could've used 4 pillows instead of 3, and plush instead of feathered. Other than that, the room was fine. The bar was kind of lame. The only patrons were middle-aged to senior-aged guests of the hotel who seemed to frightened to venture outside. The beer selection was terrible (who needs 12 domestic lagers?) and overpriced. We didn't try any \"signature cocktails,\" and I'm sure we weren't missing much. The bartender was a bit of a jerk, too. We hoped to see a different bartender later in our stay, but it was the same guy every night. The bell desk was cool about keeping our bags for us while we did some more sightseeing on our last day after we checked out. The bell staff was very helpful and friendly, beyond their duties. The front desk staff wasn't terrible, but seemed aloof and nonplussed about working there. On the first night, our keycards were somehow erased and we had to go to front desk to have them replaced. The staff didn't seem to concerned or apologetic about this inconvenience to us. As for food, there was a nice tea/coffee shop across the street, a 24 hour Dunkin' Donuts (!!!), and a burrito place that was not that great.

We were able to overlook the small rooms, closet-sized bathrooms and elevators, lack of room safes, etc. Not a huge deal. As is often the case, though, PEOPLE are the true indicators of a good business, and this establishment gets two thumbs down. Day 1: Following our arrival Friday afternoon,. I realized I had left my camera in the car. Since the car was valet parked (for $41/day), I kindly requested an employee retrieve my camera for me. This slight request was answered with a furrowed brow and huffy response from the door man. Frankly, I was taken aback with such a response. This guy works here, right? Only after I repeated the request, did the man get on his walkie-talkie with the valet. The camera was then delivered to me, 20 minutes later. I was slightly irritated, but let it go...... Day 2: After an exhausting day on the town, my brothers and I made our way to the hotel terrace for a cigarette and to enjoy the night air. It was midnight, and we soon learned that the terrace closes at 10:00 pm -- for some people.. Although a group of ladies and an older man were out there having a wonderful time, when WE sat down at a table and chairs, security appeared. The security guard walked right past the other patrons, and told us the terrace was closed. Again, I was shocked and irritated. I realize that my brothers are large men, and for people who do not know them, they may appear threatening. In reality, however, they are respectful and respectable men and do not deserve to be discriminated against. I was angry, but again I let it go...... Day 3: I was ready to go. Unfortunately, when my vehicle was pulled around by the valet, I immediately noticed that the clock face was damaged. I pointed the damage out to the valet who basically ignored me, then told me to talk to the man working at the garage across the street. He was obviously no help either. I filed a vandalism claim with my insurance and am out $150. Would I return to this hotel? No. Would I fire the staff and rehire new?

I mainly wanted to pay for the valet of my car however decided that the even dollar amount would be good. I handed over the cash and the cashier looked at me as if I was wasting her time; at that time I required a receipt be provided; I must admit it was my fault for not reviewing the folded up receipt because the cashier charged the credit card that reserved the room. Once the credit card statement was received there were two charges; one in the amount of $100 and the other for the remaining amount. Very odd how the one receipt that was for $100 cash does not have a cashier number listed... The accounting staff has not been pleasant and is not willing to connect us directly with the hotel manager, office manager, front desk manager, etc (we keep getting the run around) and keeps insisting that we will receive a call back. I do however find it odd that the accountant has reviewed the video tape and apparently stated that I paid with a credit card which was never swiped and what in the world would the cashier do with the credit card since she didn't hand anything back to me. I feel that they are not taking the proper steps to resolve this issue. We will not be staying here again, if you can't trust the lobby/cashier staff on camera who can you trust.

They were lovely and clean and the bathroom had a real designer feel to it. We were on the 14th floor and even from there the views were pretty amazing! The staff were amazing, Victor, who works on the transport/bell boy desk was so friendly and knowledgeable. Lindsey, the concierge seriously couldn't do enough for you and Simeon, the receptionist recommended so many nice places to eat! You could just say the word breakfast to him and he'd list off half a dozen places to go! It was freezing in Chicago when we visited, got down to a positively siberian -26 celcius but the hotel was always so warm, and the fully adjustable heating/air con in the room was a god send!

The Inn couldnt be positioned in a better location and is right off of Michigan avenue whilst also within a very short walking distance to Navy Pier,Grant and Milenium Park and all of the loop and downtown attractions. Directly outside of the hotel there is a new tea room called The Argo and a Seven Eleven,Dunkin Doughnuts and a few burrito places which are open 24/7 as well as a Popeyes and a Subway so its very handy if you want to pop out for some food in the evenings after the main resturants are closed down for the night. The nearest CTA line is the red line which is only a few minutes walk along E Ohio Street to the Grand/State station which serves Union Station and the southern areas. The hotel has a few coffee/food vendors in the lobby as well as a cool Inn Bar and lots of areas to sit and use the wireless internet and relax in the evenings which is nice,I never got try the rooftop seating area as it was closed for construction during my stay but from the sounds of it im sure it would be a very nice view of the city and Michigan avenue. I found my room to be basic but clean and spacious,with a nice work area desk for my laptop which was good as my room was included with free wireless internet coupons that were given to me upon check in as well as the tea/coffee facilities,iron/ironing board,hairdryer etc and lots of cable tv channels. The bathroom was clean and spacious with a large bath/shower combination as well as a large old fashioned looking sink which was a nice boutique touch to the room,also included were the usual hotel amenities such as shower gel,soaps,conditioner etc. I managed to get quite a reasonable rate for this hotel and i couldnt of asked for a better location especially since i was only walking distance to the Barack Obama election rally in grant park which was incredible to attend and it served as a major hub for all of the citys attractions with the option to walk to all of the major transport links and usual Coach USA,Gray Line,Greyhound and trolley tours of the city. My final view on the Inn of Chicago is basically that if you are looking for a clean,basic,reasonably priced hotel that is in a perfect location for all of the citys attractions and has enough in room facilities to keep you ticking over on a rainy day with lots of options for eating nearby as well as being family friendly then im sure you will love staying here.", "Date": "November 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northeast Iowa", "Title": "\u201cSo-so\u201d", "Author": "gowangirl", "ReviewID": "UR21825262", "Content": "Stayed two nights for a professional conference.

There is no restaurant in the hotel. There is a bar in the lobby and a branded coffee/espresso shop off the lobby, but that's not a problem with many other options near by.

It's not that she was rude; it's that she was probably one of the most unfriendly, miserable people that I have talked to in a long time - robotic, no personality; it was shocking how cold this woman was. The rooms are average, like ones that you would get at a budget hotel for $69, but since they are located so close to downtown, they somehow get away with $200+ rates during the week. There is no free wireless in your room, they only offer it (free access) in the lobby; I guess the highest level rooms have internet; I stayed in a King Deluxe - no internet here (you have to pay a ridiculous rate of $10 per day for it). Of course the 22nd floor was closed for construction, so who knows about that space, but chances are it's just as crappy as the rest of the place. The TV program menu set up is the worst, most unreliable set up I think I have ever seen anywhere. The movie menus never work and you can't turn off the volume or even lower it to a reasonable level (on local channels). The \"Service\" selection on the menu brings you to a white screen with computer file names listed. The worst part is, is that no one in the place seems to know how to fix the problem with their system - they all say \"we've been having problems with Comcast lately\". Who knows how long this \"lately\" is since in the entire week that I was there, the movie option on the TV never worked - only local channels are available with a constant high voltage hum in the background. The room itself is not too bad, and the cleaning staff does a good job. The cards for the doors constantly die or get wiped, my colleague had to get a new card every night of the week - I've never seen this problem before. The staff attributes this problem to keeping the card near your cell phone or credit card, you know typical things that you have in your pocket or wallet - I guess you are supposed to carry the card around in your sock or something. The self parking situation is equally as atrocious. Now it may be a common practice, but I have never seen this system before - you park you car in the garage, but then you have to surrender YOUR keys to the parking garage attendant. The explanation for this is that in case of fire they would have to move your car. If there was a fire, who in their right mind would attempt to drive over 100 vehicles out of a burning structure. Any attempts at resisting giving the attendant YOUR keys are met with them basically arguing and fighting with you about this ludicrous policy. There is no complimentary coffee - you have to buy the stuff for $2+ / cup, and don't even think about continental breakfast. The bar looked nice, but one can only imagine how inflated their prices would be. The chair in the corner of your room is very uncomfortable - it's impossible to sit on it for any length of time. There are barely any receptacles for plugs in the rooms, so plugging in your phone or laptop is challenge - unless you use the built in receptacle in the desk lamp. Trying to give out the telephone number of the place to someone from your room is not easy either since it is not written down on the phone or anywhere else for that matter. Oh and to use the gym, you have to leave the building walk a block and a half, and then pay $5 per usage. The only thing that gave me comfort about the whole experience was that I wasn't paying for the room - luckily my company did!

We booked a standard room with a king size bed for $109 a night. The room was recently renovated with a brand new bed, furnishings, and decor. The bed was very comfortable and the room very soundproof. Yes, the bathroom was small but it served the purpose. As for the help, the front desk, concierge, and housekeeping were all very helpful and friendly. One evening, I aked the concierge about reservations at the Grand Lux. She told me they do not take reservations, but gave me her business card. She said present the card to the hostess at the Grand Lux and I would receive preferred seating. We went over for dinner and upon presenting the card, we were seated within 15 minutes for what appeared to be an hour wait for everyone else. In conclusion, there are better hotels in the area if you are willing to pay the price. There is no indoor pool here nor restaurant, but you get a nice room and great location in downtown Chicago for around a $100 a night. That is enough for us.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cneed to learn some manners\u201d", "Author": "bailebeag", "ReviewID": "UR12020453", "Content": "It's taken me a while to get around to this review, but my anger at the way myself and my girlfriend were treated during our stay has yet to abate - even during the holiday period.

From the get-go, she made it feel like it was a chore to even book us in - her excuse was that the computers at the front of the hotel were down. We had booked a deluxe suite, getting a deal on the internet. Upon hearing this, she had the temerity to suggest 'I doubt that, they are $700 a night.' Granted, we are no high-rollers, but we are thirtysomething professionals and felt a tad offended. Once we went up to our suite, we discovered it was anything but deluxe- even the faucets(or taps) were broken in the bathroom- and the promise of a hottub turned out to be false- it was barely even a bath. We were pretty exhausted, having travelled up from st louis that afternoon, so didn't bother complaining- doubt the woman at reception would have paid us any attention anyway. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and I must say this was the worst experience I ever had in over 10 years of travelling. The bell staff were very nice and helpful, but hardly made up for the rudeness of their front of house staff. Chicago is a class city, one of my favourite I've ever been in but don't stay here.

The design is such that it juts out taking up 1/2 the doorway. You may bump your hip on it. Also, there isn't a lot of counter space, so if you have a lot of toiletries, you will have no place to put them. In my opinion that is a really small gripe. This hotel is definitely a no frills kind of place, but it's clean, affordable, cute, and I had a great nights sleep at a place that is right in the heart of the city.

Michigan Ave, 120 seconds to Nordstroms. Great cafes and restaurants within one or two blocks. Lake Michigan and Navy Pier about five blocks east. The hotel itself. Ok, so it was built in the 1920's. The bedrooms are small and so are the bathrooms. For anyone who has stayed in a hotel in Europe, this will be very familiar. Just how big of a bathroom does anyone need? More room would have been nice but not necessary. Some rooms are bigger than others. I think we were a little fortunate to get a corner king room that had windows on two sides and great views, and was a little bigger and more comfortable. So if more room is what you need, ask for room 2025, or other corner rooms. Condition of the room. Average, to above average but not outstanding. Certainly clean but a little worn. Nothing that a little money wont cure. Front desk. Below standard. Friendly but not knowledgeable about their own hotel's policies and practices. Three different people gave me three different stores on the parking fees. One said that the self park was part of the room rate which I found out was wrong. The bellhops and valets were very helpful and knowledgeable. The front desk staff definately needs training. I'd guess your opinion of the hotel would also vary depending on the prices paid for the room. In just looking at November 2007, the prices for a deluxe gueen room, will vary from $71 a night to $539. At $71 it is an absolute and amazing bargain. At $200 a night you are still doing very well. At $539 its well over priced for what you get. They are pricing for the market they are in. If you are flexible on your dates, you can get a marvelous bargain. If you get stuck with a $539 price, you will feel cheated for the value received. My definition of a boutique hotel is one that is special and almost perfect. This one is very good but no gold ring. However its certainly satisfactory. The room air conditioning was not all that noisy, certainly not more noise than the average hotel room. But it can use some minor freshening up, and front desk staff training. The concierge could be more friendly. The point is go enjoy Chicago. You will be in a wonderful and fun filled area.

Paint on the windows was slapped on, the carpet was soiled and tattered along the edges, the furniture was cheap looking, AND the halls and rooms reeked of disinfectants. I had to change rooms (something I never do) several times to find one I could at least spend the night in. This was more like a motel in a tall building rather than an actual hotel, with few amenities or comforts. I would have expected this for $89 a night, but for $299- 499, which I was charged...I was NOT pleased. There is a small bar and a fireplace in the lobby, otherwise you need to walk to eat, pick up snacks or personal items. The bathing products they offered were an odd mix of \"Best Western\" soaps and several different brands of shampoo, conditioner and lotions. Two good things that I can say is that management was kind and helpful AND it is a good location for getting around the downtown area. But considering my experience...I'd rather stay someplace else to get around, especially at those prices. I would have left if I didn't pre-pay and there was any availability.

The bottom line is that this hotel is a great choice if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend a lot of money. In fact between valet parking and the room itself, I paid about $100 for this place which is remarkable given its location. If I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent $50-$60 more, I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve chosen another hotel. There certainly are cons about this hotel: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Tiny bathrooms, rooms, elevators: The bathroom might be the smallest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. The room itself was small as well, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen smaller rooms in Chicago (e.g., Days Inn Lincoln Park) and world-wide. The elevator was small and could barely fit 3 people, especially if one had suitcases, but you make do. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Cheapness factor: This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Swissotel or the Hyatt. The hangers are the kind that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move from the bar. They have plastic cups instead of glass. The towels aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wildly absorbent. The remote control for the TV was beat up and obviously hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced when the place was renovated recently. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Noise: We had a room facing the Ohio Street side. They had a construction site across the street. The noise from that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad for the night we stayed, but the traffic noise easily seeped into the room (sirens, horns, etc.). This is different than my experience in other more modern hotels in downtown Chicago which seal out noise better (e.g, Intercontinental, Swissotel, etc.). Also the hall noise was a bit of a problem at times, I can tell that the doors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a great job of sealing out noise (even though a lot of people are just plan rude and talk too loud). Pros: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Cleanliness: Since I stayed only one night and quite literally spent about 8 of the 10 hours in the room sleeping, my biggest priority in a room is cleanliness. For a 2/2.5 star hotel (the 3.5 star rating on Hotwire is a bit off), this place was very clean. I think it was newly remodeled and the rooms had blankets with duvets and also clean bathrooms. Again for the price I paid, this place had the cleanliness of a 3.5/4 star hotel. This included the uniquely decorated lobby. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Customer Service: They seemed understaffed at times, but rush periods happen. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important is that they keep their cool and remain friendly. All staff at this hotel were friendly. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Location: 4 blocks from CTA red line and a block from the Magnificent Mile, this hotel is centrally located. And again for the price I paid (under $100 for the hotel stay), this is quite remarkable. Bottom line: This is an old hotel that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been recently remodeled. The hotel is a great 2.5 star hotel, so remember this level of service when you are paying and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be very happy with the results.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBest Western, not at all\u201d", "Author": "yayaya123", "ReviewID": "UR8056770", "Content": "We stayed in the Best Western Inns & Suites in Downtown Chicgo for 3 nights in May.

The window was so small they shouldn't have bothered but it did allow the noise from the construction site across the street to fill the room at 7am each day. We had no ''do not disturb'' sign even though we asked each day for it so we were woken each morning at 8.30 by housekeeping. We had done a lot of travelling before we got to Chicago and were hoping to relax before we went home. The rate we were charged was $635 for 3 nights and was very bad value, we had stayed in motels far superior and much less expensive than this. The only 2 things going for this hotel is its locationand the close public transport which is excellent in Chicago.

Right across the street are places to get a quick meal, ice cream, doughnuts, snacks. If you want to have a special dinner you don't have to walk far at all. With a restaurant guide and a map you can find almost anything you want. There are even three well stocked supermarkets close by. We even walked to Millineum Park and the Art Institute from this hotel. We would go back here in a minute! People who work for Amtrak stay here so you know it can't be bad. If you want a place you can walk to everything from this is it. Take the elevator to the 22nd floor to go out on the terrace, a great vista any time of the day. The neighborhood is beautiful, too.

Just a shame I underestimated the heat and humidity when setting off on foot - I was glad that my shower worked well when I returned after a day out! I'd seen that they have a roof terrace on their website, and was suprised that there were no signs to it. However, I hopefully took the lift to the top floor and easily found it.

Apparently, this was one of THOSE weekends where ALL hotels fill up and the hotels can charge whatever they want. Although this was booked 3+ weeks prior to the trip, it was about the last thing available for this trip. Nothing at the hotel was really BAD, but it all felt very bad because of the price of the room. We ended up paying rates at or above those of the Marriott or Doubletree for this very basic motel. Even at Chicago rates, this hotel is not worth more than $120/night. We paid more than double that. The rooms are very dated, including the airconditioning which kicks on/off all night. Light sleepers beware. The bathroom is very old. We were on the 21st floor and had no water pressure in the shower. The wi-fi available in rooms on the 17th floor and above worked fine. The rooms seemed clean. Check-in was very slow and appeared to be very manual. The staff was pleasant enough but it took forever. Once checked in, one of the people in our party received a call and said that they \"accidently booked him into the wrong room\" and would he move into another room. The room they were offering was a \"parlor\" with a sofa bed. When he asked if they were offering it at the same (ridiculous) price, they said YES. Of course, he said NO. The elevators are very small and can hold only 3 or 4 people. Although credit card numbers were taken at checkin for \"incidentals\", the sundry shop wouldn't allow one in our party to charge a couple of batteries to his room. He had no cash with him, so he pulled out his credit card. Sorry, $10 minimum purchase to use the credit card....batteries were $4. So, he threw in some junk food to get the bill up to $10 to be able to buy the batteries. Today when we went to take the car out of the parking garage, the hotel wanted CASH. Again, no charging to the room or even credit card. So, we scraped up the $56 for two nights parking and paid the cash. Last thing I'll say is that the location is fine.

Everything is nearby, I wouldn't stay anywhere else as far as location goes. We walked everywhere, and if we didn't feel like walking...we definately made use of the CTA public busses (they were so convenient)...(If you are going to use busses, which you probably will because walking does get tiresome...go to any place around that says \"Checks Cashed here\" and you can get the CTA bus and subway pass, it will definately save you a lot of money rather than paying the $2 each way on busses. Make sure to ask the person what each card holds, so you can find the right one for your trip depending on how much you will use it.)

Needless to say the penny dropped and we felt ripped off. Anyway, a taxi pulled up outside the door, we gathered our bags and went outside and the bellhop nearly broke his neck running out after us to tell us that this wasn't ours and he'd ordered a mini-van for our comfort. This duly arrived and we loaded up, this \"mini-van\" was smaller than the cab we got from the airport 5 days earlier.

You could pay a lot more in Chicago without doing noticeably better.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, CA", "Title": "\u201cMy take on this place\u201d", "Author": "Seyheystretch", "ReviewID": "UR3731767", "Content": "We reserved and \"held\" 2 rooms for 3 nights here via the Best Western Website, both non-smoking, 2 queen beds per room. Upon our arrival we were told that the only rooms available were smoking rooms, one of which had only had single bed. It was late and we didn't have many options. we took them. One room, the one with 1 bed, had a great view of a ventelation unit. The other room, (both on 4th floor) had a good crop of mild growing in the combo bath/shower and peeling wallpaper in the bedroom. Both had noisy under-window AC units. Day 2 we got to change rooms, they were satisfactory, the AC units were much quieter. Starting at 8:30 AM the maids start knocking on doors \"Housekeeping!\", on day 3 we heard the knocks, sounded like the were coming from across the hall, to our surprise the maid entered our room (one of us was still getting dressed) \"Oops, sorry!\" then she left. On our last night there was a \"pet\" in our room, I think I killed it. Couldn't find it after the second stomp. Other observations, good location, State Steet and Michigan Avenue are close. Nice little exercise room on the 15th floor. The lobby carpet needed to be cleaned (shampooed), dark and grimy. They were vacuuming it upon our arrival, good place to start. Upon checking out, complained about the dirty, smoking room from first night. They knocked $11 off the 1st night's rate. Not much of compenation for our trouble. For breakfast, the coffee shop across the street, not very good. Other places nearby much better, we liked the place across the street from the Holiday Inn a 2 blocks away. If you like that sort of thing, there is a Duncan Donuts across the street.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cWow \u201d", "Author": "TANYA66", "ReviewID": "UR3530390", "Content": "We booked three rooms and got suites all on the top floor.

I got two rooms via Hotels, and made my choice based on (1) reviews from this site and (2) price. Knowing what I know now about the hotel, I would make the same choice again. The location was good - right downtown, near everything. The hotel lobby and rooms were clean. The staff was friendly. The area in which the hotel was located wasn't a bad or scary area. The rooms themselves were average in size (not tiny, but not apartment sized). The bathrooms were small, but adequate. We were on the 14th floor and had rooms on opposite sides of the hotel, and each had views of the city. The subway station was only about 4-5 blocks away, but it seemed farther when the temperatures dropped and the wind picked up. There is a Dunkin Donuts and Burrito Beach across one street, and the Cambridge House restaurant across the other. One review on this site said great things about Cambridge House -- it's not bad if you don't want to walk too far and their service is really fast, but the food really wasn't anything to brag about. Timothy O'Tooles (2 blocks away) had good food and drinks, Rock Bottom Brewery wasn't too far away (near the subway, actually) and they're pretty good too.

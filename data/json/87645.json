I can tell you that: beginning with the street-side valet (which was included in the room price along with as many in & outs free), the relaxing breakfast lakeside breakfast whose staff were attentive to your every need, to the multiple restaurants, ambiance, and luxury thorough-out (and much more), THIS IS CHICAGO'S FINEST!!!

Sometimes thin walls are a good thing. ;) Made my day as I love a deal! ;) Elite Breakfast: It was pretty so so. The wait staff don't seem to clear the tables, so we did so ourselves each morning so that we got a seat. It was pretty weak. No eggs, just cold things like yog, cereal, bread, muselix, fruits, salmon, etc. They often ran out of stuff if you get there 1/2 before closing. Also, one of the mornings they started putting the food away before it was over which was a little rude. Lobby: Beautiful. Wish we tried the various restos due to the history but we didn't so I can't comment. Next time hopefully. We tried to get a drink the one night but it was an hour wait and the waiter was a little stuffy for my liking so we didn't bother.

We pre-paid and got a very good rate. The neighbourhood is great. It is just off Michigan Ave and convenient for all the lovely stores on the Magnificent Mile and an easy walk to the conference I attended at large, chain hotel. We had a family room with 2 queen beds, 2 bathrooms, and a pleasant seating area. The first room we were given was 656 and it looked towards a brick. We could see right into the bathroom of an apartment in the neighboring building. We asked to move and went to room 621 which was much brighter and had a nice view of Michigan Avenue. The hotel was full but it never felt crowded or busy. Once in our room, we could not hear the street noise or sounds from other guests. It felt very private and secluded despite its central location. Check in was seamless. The lobby is a beautiful and spacious. The hallways are wide and very well lit with attractive wall paper and carpets. The staff are gracious and friendly. We enjoyed a drink one evening at the bar downstairs. It is pleasant and we enjoyed chatting with other guests at the bar. Overall, it was a nice stay. I would not, however, say this was a great hotel. It does not have the extras I have enjoyed at other hotels with a similar reputation. For example, there is no bathrobe in the closet, the towels are not plush, the heat system was at times loud and clanging, the air is so dry we all woke up in the middle of the night craving water and this could easily be fixed with the installation of a humidifier system, the turn down service offers salt water taffy which seems decidedly down market and odd in a place not known for salt water, and one evening the housekeeper who came in for turn down service left a bag of ice on the chair which we did not notice until morning and it left a big wet mess on the carpet. One small detail we did love was the small sofa in the elevator. It seemed so elegant to sit while the elevator carried us to our floor. If I compare the Drake to the Waldorf Astoria or the Shoreham in Washington DC, it does not come up to that level. It is lovely. It has excellent staff. It is spotless and the historic charm is so appealing. Perhaps my expectations were wrong but I was a bit disappointed. I did enjoy thinking I was at the same hotel enjoyed by Princess Diana, Bob Hope and Smokey Robinson.

Elevators are quick, lobby immaculate and rooms are very clean upon arrival.

There is wifi in the Lobby but not in the rooms, the bell boy told us that they are installing Wifi in the rooms in 2012 so that is a plus. Our stay was very pleasant even on NewYears Eve where you would think noise would be an issue because of a 3000 guest party in one of the Banquet Halls. Just a word of warning, some rooms do have adjoining doors to other rooms which can be a very bad idea. We happen to end up with one of those rooms and it wasn't a very pleasant experience until we had called the front desk. In the adjacent room there were kids banging on the walls, creating a rucous and one was going in and out of their rooms slamming the door in the hallway. A quick call to the front desk helped the matter but you were made to wonder that the parents don't realize that it's a hotel not a playground. Conversation can be heard in these type of rooms so be very aware of this as we noticed on the other wall where a couple of people were staying. I'm sure they heard every word we also said but if privacy is what you need this isn't the type of room you would get, suggest you get one that don't have these doors. A good set of earplugs helped during the night but we regret that we didn't ask for a different room but the hotel was almost completely booked for that weekend.

There certainly was some \"good\" interspersed with the \"bad\" and I make it my rule to always post the \"good\" first. So, the lobby of this grand dame is lovely with lots to see for all ages in many holiday decorations. Our rooms were ready at 3:10 when we arrived and we upgraded to the Club Floor but for $60 each but I really do love being on the Club whenever I can because of all that entails. And we were told that the rooms themselves were nicer too. And maybe they were. My mom's room was right next door to ours but it was nicer with a nice entryway with pretty console table, a loveseat and so forth. Ours was a bit odd in that it was just set up wrong such as the loveseat not facing the TV but positioned along the same wall as the TV - weird. The bathrooms are very plain - nothing fancy as in many hotels. We were told that the appetisers in the Club were not complimentary so we went down to the Coq d'Or and got 2 bowls of soup, a bowl of fries and several glasses of wine for $83 only to find out that the Club is in fact complimentary. We're not cheap but we figured if we have to pay for snacks in the Club, why not go down to the pub and have our choice of what to order. We didn't want a lot as we going out for a big dinner at 6:30 so the snacks would have held us over. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. In the morning, we had another problem. We thought the water controls on the tub were the ones you use to turn on the water and the dial above is a divertor to send it up to the shower but we couldn't get the water to stop coming out below so the tub was filling up faster than it could drain so you're standing in hot water as you're trying to shower. After this we had had it and felt a call to the front desk was in order explain some of this. They apologized for the miscommunication on the Club amenities. About the tub, she said, 'Yes - they have heard that from other guests and they knew the tub didn't work right. Well, that's all I needed to hear - if I was the first one to have this problem, I'd have thought maybe I was the dense one - but to have known that this was a problem for previous guests and not the have done something about it - ridiculous! They did comp us back the $60 upcharge per room but I would much rather have had a more successful experience. My hope when traveling is to have a really great experience all the way around and if I pay a little more for it - fine! But that is just not what happened. I think - no I know - I'll stay somewhere else next time in Chicago! P.S. The staff up in the Club were truly lovely and the view there was spectacular.

A lot of the woodwork was dinged up, the rooms are a tad awkward, and the plumbing is weird. My room's shower took forever to drain. I stood in 2 inches of water while showering. The toilet flusher was mounted on the wall like a joystick. Odd, but this is what I expected and it truly is a treasure for an old hotel...of sorts. As a Hilton Gold, I was given access to the Executive Lounge which was a treat. I was denied both an upgrade and/or a lakeview room, so I think this was the consolation offering. All in all, I was happy with the lounge. This was easily the highlight of the trip since the lounge had a jaw-dropping view. Based on what I've read, lounge access as a Gold (and sometimes as even a Diamond) is tough due to the small size of the lounge, which is only accessible via stairs. At the valet, they seemingly lost my vehicle as I stood there waiting for 50 minutes at which point I contacted the front desk manager. The manager was apologetic and comped the $50 parking fee.

But, while The Palmer House is very good, The Drake was excellent. We stayed in the King Bed Deluxe room and it was very spacious and comfortable. The closet and bathrooms were a good size. The interior of the hotel is very tastefully done. Having stayed at other hotels we have liked in the past such as the Hotel Monaco and The Palmer House, the place where The Drake truly separated itself was in the exceptional service. We had some minor issues with a partner of The Drake through which we bought a shopping package and my wife had multiple communications with Stefan the manager at The Drake, and he was tremendous in his prompt responses (typically in under 1-2 hours), and he had this other company fix the issues immediately. Also in the Drake Brothers restaurant were we had complimentary buffet breakfasts (also through the shopping package we purchased), Gisele one of the employees there went above and beyond what we would expect even from an upscale establishment.

In every way, I am so very glad I did. It was a good walk up Michigan Avenue, only a mile or so from the convention, and a quick taxi return. Located on the shores of Lake Michigan, next door to the wonderful view from the top of the Hancock Building, the Drake Hotel beats the Marriott any day! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timeless beauty with everything you want in a hotel. Actually, last week I was in another city in another historic hotel, a hotel also owned by Hilton. Both similarly-priced hotels are located in their city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, have ornate lobbies, beautiful carpeting in the hallways, LavAzza coffee in the rooms, Peter Thomas Roth soap in the bathrooms, identical ice buckets near the large screen television, and so on. Yet there is no comparison. Not only do you get a terrycloth robe, the Drake is rich with history. Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initials are carved in the bar, Princess Dianna slept here, and high tea at the Drake is still one of those must-do experiences when visiting Chicago. My room had three large widows, a shower and a tub, a separate study, and plenty of good lighting with multi-settings on all lamps. The room was large, well appointed, and incredibly clean. I purchased the bed and breakfast option at this beautiful landmark hotel. The bed part could not have been better, due in part to the blackout shades behind the windows\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sheers. Breakfast in the Drake Brothers Restaurant was perfect. Normally priced at $23, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lavish buffet with especially lovely Virginia ham, salmon, breads, and berries. They gave me a handful of extra coupons and some friends joined me for a leisurely meal. The Drake Hotel is uniquely superb. It is immaculate, well maintained, and hopping. Then again, in this age of economic downturn, so is Chicago. Unlike so many other cities, this one seems to be thriving. Treat yourself to the Drake.

I stayed at the The Drake for two nights for a meeting. The Drake is on a great section of Michigan Avenue (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci are right there!) and one block away from the Hancock Building and the old water tower is nearly as close. The lobby of this hotel is gorgeous and the staff was all very helpful and nice. Its just stunning to walk in and see the public areas. However, the meeting room areas and sleeping room was a different story. My room was on the 7th floor facing Michigan Avenue. I'm happy to say that I could hear no sounds from the outside and the view was just fine for me (who's staying in their room anyhow!). Unfortunately, the rooms at The Drake are very noisy. From both neighbors opening and closing their Roman shades, staff hollering and shouting in the halls or using their walkie talkies at all hours to everyone's room doors slamming shut whenever they come or go. Its incredible that the housekeeping staff is so loud at this hotel. The room is somewhat sterile in its appointments and other than a mirror on the wall, I don't recall any other artwork. My bedskirt was ripped and stained - this didn't give me a confident feeling although the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was also the coldest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The air-conditioner was set at 66 degrees when I got into the room but even adjusting it to 80 degrees did not change the cold blast coming from it. Co-workers and I had the same situation - the only way to warm up the room was to turn the entire unit off. This is not acceptable. The meeting rooms were also unusually cold. Internet usage in the room is only by ethernet cord - there is no wireless in the rooms; however, the internet speed was fast which is usually not expected in a hotel. Several of the meeting rooms on the west side of the hotel have single bathrooms which is strange to be in a meeting and hear folks flushing the toilet. The door to one of the conf room bathrooms was not cleaned. While The Drake was fine, certainly it appears more focus is spent on the public areas than the rooms.

However, when I arrived on Sunday, my room was not ready. The clerk at first seemed unwilling to assist and basically told me to come back in 3 hours, however, after I explained that I was here on business and needed to change clothes and go to a meeting, he then upgraded me to an Executive Suite, which was very large and nicely decorated. The hotel clearly is old, but they have done a wonderful job of keeping the amenities and interior of the rooms updated while at the same time preserving the historical aspects of the hotel. The rooms are extremely large, and I was happy to realize that although an older hotel, I had no problems and was not able to hear noises from the adjoining rooms (something that can often happen at older hotels). The bell staff is great, and if you valet park you pay more, but then you have in-and-out privileges (otherwise if you self-park you do not). I did realize the in-room mini bar was not working and told them mid-week; I returned that evening with a note that said it had been unplugged, yet I had already tried that earlier in the week and it did not work. They never came back or asked about it so I opted to not utilize it (the cost was rather expensive anyway). The famous hotel bar is great, and very comfortable to have a cocktail and quiet enough you can have a discussion without having to shout yet you can also watch sports if you desire.

My question to them was...how did the guy get access to the interior of the hotel to begin with??, especially since they \"supposedly\" check guests after midnight for a valid roomkey before giving them access!!!! So, either they don't check everyone for a current roomkey, he has an OLD roomkey (that they haven't changed for a while & therefore can't tell if it is current) or he is an employee!!

However, being constrained by travel budgets, their rooms have typically been over my limit. But this time I managed to bag a room for less than my max spend and decided to give it a go. I arrived direct from a long haul transatlantic flight into O'Hare tired and in need of a freshen-up. The doorman was polite and told me to go upstairs to registration. The hotel is indeed very nice in terms of furnishings and it was a pleasure to be surrounded by a hint of opulence. Registration took a while but the guy was a trainee and was at pains to get it right, which I didn't mind. They gave me a lake view room on the 6th floor and it was a lovely room, nicely appointed and a great view of Lake Michigan. Free coffee, alarm clock to which I could hook up my iPod, a big work space, roomy closet, comfy bed, spacious bathroom with nice toiletries. My stay was comfortable but I did have a few gripes, which I put in my feedback form back to the hotel management. They include: 1. No wireless Internet in the rooms, there is only a hard wired connection and in this day and age where folks are increasingly on the move with smartphones and tablets, not offering wifi is inexcusable. Not all of us bring clunky laptops to these hotels where you have to connect via a LAN cable. 2. No free water in the room. Normally, I would expect there to be a few free bottles of mineral water, on either side of the bed or on the main desk. All you get here is a huge glass bottle of Evian with a somewhat austere notice around the bottle's neck saying that you will be charged $7 should you dare to drink it. Ouch. 3. There was a mini bar but it was locked. Yes, go figure! And no sign of a key anywhere! Mind you with the prices of the drinks being so high, I as glad that I couldn't get into the bar. 4. While the buffet breakfast was nice in terms of quality and variety, the staff seemed a little on the tired, near surly side and seemed more interest in how much of a tip I left versus actually providing a nice service. In all, I enjoyed the furnishings of the Drake but I don't think I would stay there again. I travel a lot for business and the lack of wifi in the rooms killed it for me. I guess it would have been better, had I stayed their for fun/leisure, but I am not so sure given how the Internet is integral to our day-to-day lives.

The breakfast in the Concierge Lounge (10th floor, but one flight of stairs above where the elevator leaves you) was high-quality, though sadly lacking oatmeal. Quiet for the most part.

There were two sconces for lighting over the sink, and I could have written my name in the filth on them. Overall, the bathroom just smelled musty and of mildew, and I felt the need to bathe again upon returning home just to get the \"cooties\" off of me. When I mentioned to the front desk staff about the mildew and filth, she cringed and said \"Sorry about that\". Really? Sorry? How about calling housekeeping and getting them up there to CLEAN the room? I wanted to take photos of how disgusting it was, but forgot until we were on our way home. I wish I would have, because a photo speaks for itself. Hilton Hotels should be ashamed to have let such a beautiful historic hotel fall into such ruin. What a shame.

Breakfast in the lounge offered thier famous 'muselli' along with some wonderful pastries and baked goods, cereals, cheses, lox..too much to mention! The lounge is also open for cocktails (for a fee) and light appetizers. There seemed to be ample seating available and there was a computer there also. Our room was more than spacious. When we opened the door to our room, we were in the foyer, roughly 30 feet long and 12 feet wide. On the right side was our living room with a wet bar....there was no way this could be confused with a 'sitting area', this truly was a living room with full sofa and lounge chairs. The wet bar was a nice surpise and well used! Our bedroom contained an extrememly comfortable huge bed and another sofa. TV's in both rooms. The bathroom reflects the era when the hotel was built... walk in shower, soaking tub, mirrored sink, scale, the toilet seemed odd (especially with the flush handle coming out of the wall) but all worked well. I was thrilled to have such great housekeepers on our floor. They always took time to say hello and asked if we needed anything. They were getting the suite across the hall from us ready and offered a quick peak at the view of Lake Michigan...nice view, but our room had a seperate bedroom....then...one of them said....\"go down to the end of the hall in about a half hour, we're getting another suite ready and winked.\" Turns out they were cleaning the \"Lady Dianna\" suite......and.....I got a sneak peak at that too!!!! There are so many surprises this hotel holds. The evelators have benches...never saw that before! Oh my gosh, our room had a doorbell!

I was thrilled to book the Drake at a very affordable rate through Expedia. I had heard the hotel was the classic grande dame of downtown Chicago. Maybe it once was but that is over. The only sense of a proud history is when you walk into the lobby and up the stairs it's a beautiful entrance. But once you're inside it's downhill from there. The front desk personnel offered the minimum in customer service. They did their job but were not welcoming. They were rather arrogant actually and after staying there I can't imagine why. When I got to my room it smelled so strongly of cleaning chemicals I immediately had to prop open the door to the hall. This didn't help. I found the maids at the end of the long hall and they tried to tell me it didn't smell. Finally one of them said, 'well they told us to hurry with that room.' This seemed to acknowledge there was a problem but they didn't offer to help. Normally I would ask for another room but my friend's room was the same. The chemical smell was not as strong but the room smelled bad and was dirty. I would have checked out immediately but I had a non refundable package and I couldn't afford to. The thing about the dirt here is that it is long accumulated. There isn't visible dust for example, but there's a deeper level of dirt that is like a film over everything. Finally -- and I honestly kid you not -- I started wiping things down with a hot washcloth. We were staying for three nights and I had to do something. The results were incredible, as in the rag was filthy. I kept trying other parts of the room and every part of the room was the same. To make a long and dreary story short, I cleaned for two hours and the smell lifted. I started with the desk, nightstand, phone, remote and went as far as the bathroom floor, even as much of the walls as I could reach. The colors that came up were not just brown and black but orange and yellow. It was jaw dropping. I probably ruined many of the towels and washcloths but maybe they'll get the message. I asked them not to use chemicals in cleaning the room for the rest of my stay. They acted like this was a crazy request and I had to plead chemical sensitivity and allergies (not true) to get them to take me seriously. Except for one morning they complied with my request. There is a wonderful view of the water from the hotel but it's difficult to enjoy because, surprise, the windows are so dirty. Other issues: the restaurant is rather cavernous. The service was hit or miss. The food was an average hotel buffet for breakfast. Items ran out and were not replenished. The concierge in the lobby was helpful but she was overwhelmed with people needing help. I stood in line and most of the time I gave up. In the basement there's a Chanel and a Georg Jensen store. They were deserted. I doubt anyone who could afford these brands would be staying at this hotel. The Drake experience was pretty much a disaster. If you look at my reviews you'll see that I try hard to be fair, helpful and generous. And, trust me, I'm not a neatnik! But this was a really over-the-top situation.

It is very cold in Chicago, no ned to be treated coldly especially when there are many other choices in the city for more ffordable prices. I 2- I was surprised to see that one of the coffe cups was used. This was noticed on the first day of check in. I did not report it. Strangely it was not changed throughout my stay. 3- This is 2011, internet is the means of communication. I strongly believe that a hotel without free internet connecton or at least a nominal cheap connection fee is not business nor tourism friendly. While The Drake scores high on my review, it could have scored top score if internet was provided free in rooms or at least in some areas of the facility.

Every shopping, dining experience, or tourist attraction was all within walking distance (and a pleasant walk it was!). The rooms are furnished with elegant furniture and feature lots of original (or close replicas) hardware on the doors, toilet, lights, etc. This, however, is what made part of this experience quite unejoyable... The walls and doors are paper thin because they're (as far as I could tell) quite orginal. I could hear every conversation in the hall from my bed, got to know personal (ahem)business my neighbors were involved in, and couldn't talk above a low murmur without worry everyone else in the hotel could hear me as well. This made sleep uncomfortable and caused me to be awake as much as I was asleep on one night in particular. Additionally, while every member of the hotel staff greeted you and made contact as you passed, they were very uninviting. This isn't reserved to the custodial staff that you'd normall expect to be quiet, but every other group in the hotel you'd expect to be more hospitable. Don't mistake what I'm saying... VERY service minded, but VERY unfriendly. If you're not looking to make nice or expect others to at least pretend to be nice back, this won't bother you. However, as a southerner, this is completely opposite to what I'm used to. Finally, my opening comment was regarding the perfect location... this is ONLY true if using public transportation or walking. If you have to leave the downtown area, GOOD LUCK. This city system is so screwed up, there's bumper to bumper traffic across all 5+ lanes going each direction around the downtown area from about 14:00-18:00. This makes getting back to downtown from any of the surrounding burbs a miserable (and very slow) experience. Chicago was a nice city, but I'm in no hurry to go back.

To start with this is the first review for a hotel we have submitted and we have stayed at many hotels in the downtown Chicago area over the last 7-8years. Our Trip Advisor basics are we discount any comments from a couple on their honeymoon (if you had a bad honeymoon it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the hotels fault!). A sincere but brief email to the Drake hotels manager and general manager was the start of a fantastic stay, the two gentlemen Stefan and Russell both took the time to email us back and took a genuine interest in our upcoming stay. In fact they gave us their cell numbers if we needed anything looked after prior to arriving at the Drake. To take the time and make the offer of contacting them by cell in the middle of running the hotel and the conferences that were at the hotel was I thought superior service. We received an room upgrade to a executive suite and unlike many other hotels the executive suite actually lived up to its name\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 door bell to the room, full kitchen (full sized fridge, cupboards, sink), 2 bathrooms, two king size beds, two t.v.s, full dining room, about 8 full size windows overlooking the lake and beach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6wow, we paced it off and the suite was about 40ft by 45ft! It was my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday (a significant number) and our anniversary around the time of our stay and they sent up a chocolate cake and chilled champagne upon about an hour after we checked in, again great service. I wanted to leave a review after reading some of the reviews in the recent several months. In summary the hotel is elegant, a bit sophisticated and yes, is not really trendy but I would take the classic style of the Drake and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timeless feel over a hotel that thinks chic is changing the paint colour and lamp shades every year for the latest trend. An example of this is the Cqd D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122or Lounge on the ground floor, it is such a classic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lounge, wood/leather everything, a bit cramped and service from a real bar tender and not a barely of age kid as in so many establishments\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6note this is not a sports bar it is a true Lounge. As stated so many times, the Drake is in a great location close to everything including public transit. Our tips from this trip, take in the Wrigley Field baseball park tour, see a Sox game in the south side, buy the transit pass (a great deal) and check out the Chicago Botanic Gardens about a 45min ride from the downtown on the regional transit system.

It's also in a great location - about a block from the John Hancock Tower, three or four blocks away from the lakefront \"beach\", and about a 20 minute walk to Navy Pier. This hotel is not a great place to stay if you want things to work right. Some examples: (1) There are large flat screen TVs in the rooms (really too large for the smaller rooms, in my opinion), and a note that says \"We are currently upgrading our cable television service to High Definition, which has changed some of our channeling.\" However, my picture was fuzzy and clearly not High Def, so I called downstairs and they sent up an engineer. He was very nice and apologetic, but the bottom line is they probably won't be switching to High Def until this winter sometime. He fiddled around with the connections, but the picture didn't really get any better. (2) I switched to a larger room on the second day (more on that later), where the Internet connector was broken and I couldn't get the heat to work. I called downstairs for both problems and they sent up a different engineer - also very pleasant and competent - who replaced the Internet cord, and told me the building's heat was not yet turned on... so he left me a six foot space heater. (3) The phone beside the bed was dead. (4) The TV remote control was worn out... no numbers on the channel buttons and the on/off switch required a very hard push just inches away from the screen. I didn't call downstairs for these last two. (5) TV service was out one night in the whole hotel (the front desk said it was an area outage), so we were told we could watch a movie free of charge. Unfortunately, and surprisingly to me, most movies were \"sold out\" because of the large number of people accepting the offer. Bottom line... quite a few things didn't work right in the room (bad), but the hotel acted quickly to try and make them right when notified (good). I would just prefer to have them right before I check in. Service was a bit of a mixed bag. I didn't get a requested complementary room upgrade when I checked in, even though we found out the next day it was available and should have been given to me... so I ended up changing rooms the second day (which was a pain in the neck). Room service for dinner, which was quite expensive, brought me the wrong dessert and forgot my fries, both on the same night... but corrected both problems. The In-Room Dining menu is pretty limited. I found the Guest Services number and Operator to be staffed by some folks who could use customer service training - they were quite abrupt at times. Other staff such as housekeeping went out of their way to be very friendly and hospitable. The concierge was helpful. They have an awesome breakfast buffet, with lots of hot food including omelets made to order. However, it's very expensive ($23) if it doesn't come with your room rate. I think I'll try somewhere else next time.

We selected a category that was junior suite, lake front view. I even had the print-out that stated this description along with the rest of the reservation. When we got to the front desk the clerk said it was NOT a lake front we would be getting, but a \"city view\" When I protested, and showed the print-out as proof, she could have cared less. Ms. Frosty at the front desk was hearing none of it and was completely nonplussed to the point of rudeness and adamantly insisted the hotel was full and they could do nothing for us. Nonsense. It was a weekend. Later later on, one of the bartenders told us the hotel was at 47 percent. When we arrived in our room, the \"city view\" was of the air conditioning units on the roof. Nice. Especially since we paid the hotel's rate - thought that by booking direct we might have a bit of consideration over others who use generic multi-booking hotel sites. Not at The Drake. The more I thought about it, the more upset I became and I called the manager later. No real interest or apology from him, either. Considering we had stayed at The Drake before, I was not impressed with his response. The room itself was fine - clean spacious and everything worked properly but the view of air conditioning units was a complete let-down. I am afraid that the current crop of employees have brought a new millenium attitude - which is we don't give a care about the guests - even repeat guests. What a shame since the cornerstone of The Drake'slegacy is built on service! So I guess we won't be repeats any more - especially with all the new hotels available in Chicago.

As this is an older hotel, the rooms were not filled wtih lots of hi-tech amenities, but I was grateful for this. The room was clean and spacious and quiet and the huge king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom could benefit from a bit of updating, in particular the tub, but this is a minor issue. There are several restaurants in the hotel, all of which look excellent, but we only had breakfast in the hotel. Breakfast is served in the Drake Bros room. The buffet was a bit pricey, but it was one of the best and most bountiful breakfast buffets I've ever had. The one critque of the hotel concerns internet access. If you use the small business center to check e-mails, etc, you have to pay $6 for 15 minutes. This is excessive. I regretted not bringing my own lap top and hence having to rely on the hotel's computers. But overall, The Drake is an outstanding, elegant hotel!", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Battle Creek, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cSecurity issue\u201d", "Author": "BCM10", "ReviewID": "UR74502716", "Content": "We were in Chicago recently and stayed at the Drake Hotel.

We reported the incident to hotel security and tried to get some satisfaction from either the Drake or their insurance company. No apologies were given until I had asked for one, and there were no offers of compensation.

I am not surprised that this sort of incident happened in a big city, but I am disappointed that a top rated hotel like the Drake didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make some gesture to appease us. Certainly, we would have liked the money back. But ,if they were not willing to do that without some evidence of a theft, I hoped they would have at least offered a meal, or free parking, something to make the situation right. If they had made some gesture, we would have thought the Drake management was trying to be fair. Instead, they washed their hands of the ugly incident and passed it off to their insurance company who quickly denied any claims. We can recover from the loss of money.

Now, here is the special part: first it has taken me years to make my way to the Drake (because of relatively poor tripadvisor ratings!!) eventhough I've wanted to try the high tea at the Palm court , to experience proximity to the beach and to stay in this landmark hotel with a wealth of history) and....we are here not a moment too soon. It is the anticipation of needs which sets the Drake way above the other hotels I have mentioned: at check in, all around the room, when changing any aspects of reservation, enquiring about anything: the employees appear to have a level of skill that is noticeably better than the employees (even well meaning ones) at other hotels.

The secret, however, is that you really need to upgrade to get a nice room. We've always upgraded, but we've had friends who have stayed in the standard rooms, and they say it's like staying in a closet with a view of the fire escape - if that. (I think a lot of \"upscale\" hotels are like this. The standard rooms are worse than a Holiday Inn, but the nicer rooms are spectacular.) The first time we stayed at the Drake, we requested a lake view room, and it had the most spectacular views!! The room was huge and had a little sitting area. The bathroom was small, but the size of the main room more than made up for it. On this trip, I was ill and had to spend a lot of time in the room, so the views were very important to me. I also ordered a lot of room service, and I have to say the food was excellent. The second time we stayed there, we requested an Executive Room on a high floor. We were on the 9th floor with a view overlooking the front entrance. Since Chicago is a city with tall skyscrapers, a \"city view\" is really just a view of the skyscraper across the street. It was still a very pretty view, and sure, it's entertaining to watch the people in the windows across the way, but I think the Lake View rooms are far better. In any case, our \"city view\" room was beautiful. It was smaller than the first \"lake view\" room, but we really loved the Executive Lounge, which is worth the price of the upgrade because you are provided with free buffet breakfast daily, free drinks and appetizers in the evening (alcohol for a small reasonable fee), free cans of soft drinks any time, and free computer usage. It also has that gorgeous view of the lake that our room was lacking. The beds were the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. In fact, after our first trip I went on a hunt to find out who makes the beds so that we could buy one. The lobby is beautiful and worth a walk through even if you don't stay here. We enjoyed the bar downstairs, which sometimes was so crowded you couldn't walk through and at other times was nearly empty. The location is very good.

I have stayed around the world in all types of hotels, from 2 stars to 5 stars. I was very vigilent in reading Tripadvisor and other reviews on other sites before booking with the Drake. There were many poor reviews, but I chalked them up to be fussy people. The NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE NOT EXAGGERATED! Now, the Drake is not a horrible hotel by any means. The lobby is very beautiful, and Im sure that people who book the big expensive suites are treated wonderfully, but do not be pulled in by the allure of it being a \"high class\" or a landmark hotel if you are staying in a standard room. I booked our 3 night stay via an internet booking site. This was a spur of the moment getaway to celebrate with my boyfriend. We were celebrating both of our birthdays as well as his graduation from Medical School with distinction. Needless to say, this was a very big occasion for us both. After reading tripadvisor, I saw that the General manager, Russell Menkes reads these reviews, and offers explanations for unhappy guests and his contact info. So I decided to email Mr. Menkes, telling him I had booked via Travelocity and to ask him if he would be able to assist me in reserving a room with a view or on a higher floor, or if the Drake provides anything for celebrations. I emailed him over weeks before our travel date and he has yet to respond to me. I feel that this is very unprofessional. Even if he were to answer me to say that they were unable to accomodate my request, it is better than not answering me at all. After getting no response from Mr. Menkes, I emailed the general reception desk regarding the same matter, where I received a response riddled with grammar and spelling errors (which is no crime, but again reinforced the feeling of unprofessionalism), informing me that the room I have been assigned is not known for its view, and if I wanted a view, it would cost XX dollars more per night, and this offer would expire in 24 hours. I thought that perhaps they were offering me a special \"discounted\" rate to get a room with a view, however, I checked on Travelocity and I could have easily upgraded to a room with a view for much LESS than what I was quoted. I didnt like that very much. I responded by saying, no I would not like to upgrade my room, however, it would be appreciated if they could place us on a higher floor if possible, view or no view. I received no response to that email. They did not place me on a higher floor. When arriving at the hotel, check-in was a breeze. very fast and efficient. However, once getting to the room, I could see that they had placed us in what must have been one of their worst rooms in the hotel. The room's air conditioning unit was SO incredibly loud. It clicked and clanked ALL night. and every time it turned on, the noise was equiv to the sound of a small hand held vacuum cleaner. It woke both me and my boyfriend up several times during the night. Furthermore, it was not very powerful. We happened to stay there during the extreme heatwave, and it would have been nice to have an air con unit that didnt produce musty air. The wall paper was bubbling and peeling off the wall in a very large sections, the wall paper looked a bit dirty and worn. Definitely NOT was I was expecting out of a hotel like the Drake. Ive stayed in motels that are nicer than that. The bathroom, however, was very nice, it was obvious that money had been put into renovations (marble floor, new tiling etc.), HOWEVER, where the carpet meets the marble at the doorway, there was a nail that stuck up underneath the carpet that I inadvertantly stepped on that ripped a big cut on the bottom of my foot! BEWARE, as I read another tripadvisor reviewer said the same thing. The bedding was worn, the skirt of the bed was torn, and the cups in the room were dirty. Now, I have had family members stay at the Drake previously, but in large suites. They had a fantastic time, and the service and room were great for them. However, it is quite apparant that for people who do not stay in their fancy suites, they are not treated the same as their \"richer\" guests. Overall, I had booked the Drake in hopes of celebrating and living in a luxury hotel for a few days. Instead, I was treated as a second rate guest and shoved into one of the worst hotel rooms Ive ever stayed at in North America. The Drake was a huge disappointment, and you can take the money you spend at the Drake and go to any of the other wonderful hotels on the Mile and be treated much better.

Whether it was truly an upgrade, I do not know. The room was large, with a 46\" flat screen and a king bed. Very nicely appointed; great bedding; nice quiet air conditioning; large closet with a safe; large bathroom. Everything looked great, but the bathroom was showing its age a bit and was a bit dimly lit. Overall, cleanliness was not perfect, but it was acceptable. Very high ceilings helped make the room seem even larger. Great water pressure in the shower - but the bathroom could probably use a renovation to be perfectly honest. Hardwire internet access for $13 a day (although i used my cellular card to avoid the cost). A fully stocked minibar as well. I also used the fitness center on the first floor - absolutely perfect! I ate at Cape Cod in the hotel one night. What a great meal - highly recommended. The host was covering as bartender and he was friendly, but not overbearing and served me great drinks and a perfect meal. I also ate at Rosebud just down the block from the hotel. Another great place with a pretty unique menu for a steakhouse. Mike the bartender is a great guy. I had a couple of pints of Guinness in the hotel bar in the basement...not overly impressive, but it served its purpose. A short walk gets you to the Cheesecake Factory, where you can get a piece of cake to go for a sugar fix. The number of shops, restaurants and bars within a 10 minute walk is truly amazing. Strolling down Michigan Ave is great entertainment, both for shopping and people watching. There's a pretty sizable amount of homeless people and beggars - I must admit the begging became annoying, but times are tough. So, to sum up, is the Drake perfect? No, its not. Its an old hotel that shows some wear and tear, but more than makes up for it with character. And I found every encounter with the staff to be warm and comfortable.

And while I don't doubt that the Queen of England stayed at the Drake, she certainly didn't stay in my room. Let me back up. There is much to recommend the Drake. The location right off of the Miraculous Mile (world-class shopping) and across from Lake Michigan (world-class views) is unparalleled. The hotel has an authentic \"Old World\" charm, and large, gracious rooms that reflect the grand architecture of the 1920s. But to some extent I think the hotel is resting on its laurels. This was our experience when we recently stayed in two rooms for three nights with our teenage children: We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night. The clerk at the front desk could not have been less happy to see us. In fact, one of our rooms was still not ready. He offered by way of apology that the previous guests checked out late and had not bothered to notify them. Our son was battling strep throat at the time, and desperate to get to bed. We settled him into our room. Almost one hour later he received the call that his room was ready. Maybe I expect too much, but I'd like to think that if I were running a hotel I would have sent along a fruit basket or chicken soup or something by way of apology. It's 6:30 and our room isn't ready? Could you have put us in another room, perhaps? Or offered an upgrade? it's possible the hotel was booked, but it was the weekend, not yet summer holiday, and the hotel truly did not seem busy. Next, our room: It is spacious, with a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan. But take your eyes off the lake and the view quickly deteriorates. This room (#844, I think) seems like the room that time forgot--or at least the decorators overlooked. There are no comfy chairs for sitting and admiring the view. There is one straight-backed chair, and one other Aeron type chair at the desk. Neither is conducive to lounging in one's robe enjoying coffee and a newspaper--which may be why they don't provide either amenity. I called housekeeping to ask to have two robes brought up, but nobody answered the phone. When I called the next day, they were gracious and brought them up quickly. The bed is large and comfy, but the linens are sparse. There are white pillowcases and a white duvet cover, with a simple coverlet folded at the bottom of the bed. it feels unfinished--like a woman dressed in lingerie waiting to put on her party dress. But there is no party dress--no bedspread or pillow shams or ridiculous fringed and lace-trimmed boudoir pillows that my husband hurls in exasperation but that make me feel like a princess. The lack of linens feels like a shortcut with a view to easing the housekeeping burden. Once in bed, it's impossible to overlook the tangle of cords and wires ballooning out underneath the desk. The view is not dissimilar from what I see in my basement at home. The big difference, however, is that I don't pay $400/night for the privilege. Do I expect too much from my hotel rooms? Maybe.

And while I think I would stay there again, I'd be very specific when booking about the type of room I wanted.

The TV is free on regular channels and there are many many channels, but the internet is $12.95 and is only available wired, which is fairly common and was not a disappointment to me - just info for you. The breakfast buffet was fantastic! If you are accustomed to Ponderosa then go somewhere else. This is a gourmet buffet with smoked salmon and capers! Of course they do have the standard scrambled eggs and bacon also, as well as muffins, pastries, fruits, cheeses, yoghurts, cold cuts, cereals, pancakes, Nutella, peanut butter, juices and etc. Loved it!

I explained that it was our 20th anniversary and my wife was looking forward to a special weekend. She barely looked up and handed me a key to a room that had not been touched for at least 25 years! The bathroom had chipped tile and dull marble. I was shocked at the state of the place. We spent as little time as possible in the room and tried to make the best of it. For $300.00 I've stayed at nicer and more plush Hiltons or Marriotts. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

I had booked the room using Priceline, and was thrilled when The Drake Hotel popped up as our hotel. However, after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor, I became a bit worried that we might end up in a small room needing renovation. I emailed the manager, Tom Thomas, to request the best possible room during our stay. Within a few hours, I received an email back from the Executive Assistant welcoming us in advance and assuring me that we would enjoy our stay. I kept my fingers crossed. We arrived a bit early for our stay (11:30a) and inquired about check-in, but the current guest had not checked out yet. We left our bags and went out for a bit. I called back at 1:30p, and the clerk (who politely remembered me) said our room was now ready. Upon entering the hotel, you can truly feel the emphasis they put on luxury. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, from the front desk clerks, to the concierge to the bell man. Everyone had a smile on their face and friendly things to say. The enormous flower display in the lobby fills the room with a lovely fragrance. When we checked in to our room, I could not have been more pleased! It was an enormous room, with two large beds and best of all two bathrooms. Perfect for three women! The beds were incredibly comfortable, with plenty of soft pillows and soft sheets. There was a large sitting area, nice TV, and even two large windows with a view. Everything was exceptionally clean and to a very high standard. If you are considering The Drake Hotel, I would suggest you book the hotel with confidence, and simply email the manager to ensure your room meets your expectations.

We checked in around 6pm that friday (after work, of course!) to find that we were upgraded from our junior suite to an executive suite! The hotel is a historic hotel, a classic with old-skool furnishings. It truly is a beautiful site to see! (for those looking to stay at a *modern* hotel, this is NOT the place for you, unless you can appreciate what some have called \"grandma furnishings\" in other reviews...). The elevators have little couches in them (which gave me a good laugh) and i forced us to sit down on them every time we were in the elevator alone (no man in his right mind would do this publicly :) ). Each design in the hallway all the way down to the room was so detail oriented, you can tell the craftsmanship was of great quality. The hallways were nice and wide, no need to struggle getting down as you pass others on the way to the room. The room was FANTASTIC! It was a corner room with a lakeview. The parlor was huge with a couch, armoire (tv inside), large desk, and a table with 4 chairs. Then in the next room was the bedroom which had a king size bed that was SOFT and lovely, full with at least 6 pillows. Next room was the bathroom which had marble stairs leading up to a jacuzzi tub that could probably fit 4 people in it, a seperate standing shower and a double vanity. It was def a spacious, romantic room and we were pleased. Lots of towels available for use too, big towels, not the small ones that barely get around your body! The only thing I noticed was that the TVs were very outdated (had to at least be from early 90s), as well as the telephones... however, I can maybe see why as it keeps the \"old character\" of the hotel intact. I can appreciate that kind of stuff, esp when its creating the old-Chicago feel! Location wise, the Drake really is centrally located within the Mag Mile. Its one block north of the Hancock Tower and Water Tower Place, with ample shopping, a stone's throw from the beach, and a good walk to Navy Pier if you'd really like. We ate at the Drake Brothers Restaurant in the Drake every morning, as it was part of our package. Without the package, a breakfast buffet for 2 would cost $52, just to serve as an fyi. Some may say over priced, but why would you expect anything less from a 4-5 star hotel??? The food was delicious with a wide variety to choose from. Concierge service in the lobby was nice, very informative (to the people in front of us, at least) and was able to provide me with a bandaid when I asked for it - thanks Andrea!

I guess the main point I want to make is that PREPAID / PRESELECTED ROOMS DOESN'T GUARANTEE you anything. I was under the impression that the room we had prepaid for would be held and ready for us upon check-in...not the next day. 2. my other problem is that my hotel room card was deactived the morning we were leaving.

Our friends were getting married in the ballroom so we thought that we would take this opportunity to stay at The Drake since I'm pregnant and it would be an easy escape for me to my room in the wee hours. Check in was at 3:00 and we were there on time as the wedding trolley was leaving at 5:30 and we needed time to get ready. At check in we were offered a deluxe upgrade on our king room but the hitch was that it wouldn't be ready for over an hour. Talk about dangling the carrot and yanking it away! We couldn't wait an hour and considering check in wasn't until 3:00 I can't imagine why the room wasn't ready. We settled for our existing king reservation (at $250) and found the room to be fine but of course our view was of the air conditioning units and we were next door to the Fitness area. So much for wedding party group booking bonus! I can't imagine how much money our friends spent for their wedding at The Drake but I'm sure they would have been mortified to hear about the rooms that their guests were given especially since they were \"promised\" that everyone under the group booking would be nicely taken care of. Pro's - decor was decent, slightly dated but clean. room was decent size, noise between rooms/floors was negligible. Bathroom was ok in size but only suitable for one person at a time. Con's - heating system was horribly loud, had to turn it off at night to sleep, no exhaust fan in bathroom, wireless access was not free, bottled water was $7.00 for a small bottle, split of wine was over $25, breakfast was over $25 per person with another 20% markup for room service. There was coffee in the room but I wasn't sure if it was free and the room service menu said it was $15 so we popped over to Starbucks instead. Parking was ok at $39 a night if you use the public parking lot two doors down - you can even charge it to your room tab. We ended arriving a day early and didn't have a room booked. On Hotwire we found a 3 star hotel for $63 a night in the magnificant mile area. We weren't getting in until 11:00 p.m. so we weren't that picky. The hotel ended up being the Holiday Inn Express. Of course for $63 our room overlooked the air conditioning units here as well but we had a very comfortable king bed, huge plasma tv, wonderfully decorated room, free breakfast, free wireless and a great location. The room was super small - basically just enough room for the king bed and a really small bathroom but for the money it was so much more worth it than The Drake. The building was beautiful, location was great, personnel were very friendly, self parking was around the corner. Ok, there's no ballroom, no Palm Court and Queen Elizabeth didn't stay here but does that really matter???

The liquor is in fact cheaper or about the same in the min-bar as in a regular bar (not the Drake bar). The rooms could stand upgrading, especially the carpets and the furniture. I feel a good portion of their income is from conventioneers, lots of those going on. The hotel is beautiful in the lobby, and the tea room service is great.

I called again, impatient because of the exhaustion, no answer. The third time was answered after a number of rings. I explained to the individual that the room smelled like smoke and that it was pretty nauseating. She told me to hold while she transferred me to the front desk--I must have rolled to another department. After explaining the predicament again, the front desk asked what they could do. Not wanting to be a burden, I asked for air freshener. They said they would send someone up. About 15 minutes later, the smoke and the waiting was too much, so I called again and asked for another room. They didn't have anything available until possibly 4, so they suggested we wait 2 hours until a room opened up. We couldn't bear the room, so we sat in the lobby on \"grandma's couch\" for about 30 minutes before realizing we wouldn't find any comfort there. We walked out of the hotel and saw a Bentley out front. It occurred to me perhaps why we were seemingly being ignored by the hotel. We gave the desk a cell # before we left and actually believed they would call it. But after miserably propping our heads up on a bar until 4, we still hadn't heard from them. There didn't seem to be much interest in making things right. When we returned to the front desk, they apparently had a room available but had not called us (no surprise). It was smaller than the previous room (though must have still been worth the extra $25 since it was never refunded). We could hear people in the next room, but they weren't very loud, so it wasn't an issue. Primarily where the hotel erred was on the most basic elements--the things you take for granted.

The location of the hotel is fantastic - near great shopping, the lake, and wonderful restaurants. We were able to book a great rate ($139).

The shower/tub combo was not ideal for us, and had only a hand held shower head. While the room was very elegantly appointed, it was showing signs of age - old floors and carpet, window casings, drapes, etc. The bedding and towels were nice and pretty new. The furniture was nice, and the tv was rather large and flat screened. The bar area of the Palm Court is just beautiful - had tea there on Friday afternoon, and drinks later that evening. We had only one complaint - one afternoon after a long day walking around town, we returned to our room and discovered both of our key cards would not work. We had to return to the front desk to get replacements, and it was right as most folks were checking in. All we wanted to do was get inside and relax! There are so many aspects of the Drake which reminded me of the Ritz in Paris, including the shopping areas on the ground floor. If you are wanting a new and hip hotel, this is not it. If you are traveling with children, this isn't your place either. No pool, no activities - really not a great place for kids.

And true, it has an amazing location, and it is very nice. It's just not qutie as nice as I expected. The reservation process was annoying. First, the hotel made an error on my reservation and then the hotel did absolutely nothing to correct the mistake. Then I requested early check-in and wasn't told that I'd have to pay a $25 fee to check in at noon, and so I booked a flight to arrive at the hotel at noon, and then was told about the fee. I would have liked to have known that when I requested early check-in - just good info to be aware of, and in general, I felt that the hotel was very unresponsive to problems. My room was a bit old. It was a good sized room, although I did hear there were some tiny rooms. The bathroom had been updated, but I'm thinking it may have happened in the late 80s or early 90s. So it had granite, and was a dececnt size, but the bathtub was no nicer than any economy hotel and the flush on the toilet was on the wall and looked like a public restroom flush. The bed was qutie nice - nothing blew me away, but it was nice. No robes, no slippers. Nothing else to signify \"luxury hotel.\" Room service seemed even pricier than one could expect and mediocre. Ditto for the bar where I went to lunch one day. There is a business center, but it cost me $12 to spend 6 minutes on the computer to print 4 pages. Just ridiculous to charge that kind of money considering how much guests spend to stay and dine at the Drake. I know many hotels that aren't specifically for business travelers charge fees at the business center, but it just comes across as petty. My view of the lake and the city was phenomenal, though, and the location really is spectacular.

I was looking forward to staying at the Drake; we had visited the hotel in the past for dinner and drinks. Unfortunately, after my recent stay, I doubt I will go back again. We travel there at least 4 - 5 times a year, so we've stayed at several comparable hotels and know that Chicago has many other options. The Pros 1. Wonderful location! You are a close walk to Mag Mile, Gold coast, and River North shopping and dining. Lincoln Park is a short (~10-15 minute $8.00 cab ride) drive away. The Oak Street Beach is within walking distance for running. 2. Terrific conference/catering services: The food and service was wonderful during our meeting. The staff in catering was professional and very accomodating; this further highlighted the discrepancies in service in all other areas (please see below). I definitely would return to the Drake/recommend it to others for their meeting/catering facilities. 3. Beautiful lobby, bar, and dining areas: bar/restaurant staff professional and prompt. 4. Heavenly Beds and linens were extremely comfortable--some of the best hotel beds I have slept in recent memory! LaSource bath amenities also are very nice. Room was very clean, althought the carpet/upholstery was a bit worn. The Cons: 1. As a Gold VIP HHonors member, I requested an upgrade. I have never had issues with this request (which is a part of being a member) at other hotels (i.e. Hilton Gaslamp San Diego, Chicago Conrad, Millenium Hilton NYC -- terrific service in this regard!). I was told that I could not be upgraded to an Executive level room because \"they were not available\" (yet other folks in our conference party who were not HHonors members did get rooms on the Executive floors). In addition, since I didn't require a complimentary breakfast, I asked (twice) if there was any way I could receive complimentary internet instead. I was told this was not possible unless I \"downgraded\" my room (which seemed unreasonable, since the room I was in was on a lower floor -- 4th floor -- with only a partial lake view but a great view of the heating vents). I was told I could speak with Hilton HHonors customer service. The customer service representative contacted the manager (Tom Thomas), but I never received the courtesy of a response. I really would have liked to opportunity to make what I thought was a small request (free internet versus an executive floor upgrade). 2. Cleaning staff: On two consecutive mornings, the cleaning staff entered my room ~ 9 AM without checking to see if I was still there. Luckily, I am an early riser. 3. Front desk staff seemed professional enough but clearly not particularly warm/ amenable to moving beyond the cursory motions of helping (see above). They also made an error of charging me for a mini-bar item when I had not taken anything from it. They reluctantly removed the charge. Overall, the Drake has many great qualities. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location with wonderful facilities and a terrific catering staff. in addition, the rooms are clean and the beds are terrific. Unfortunately, the front desk staff, lack of response from the General Manager despite my attempts to contact him, and the lack of basic courtesies (as a Hilton HHonors member) left me a bit perturbed. I do hope that the Drake can rectifiy these issues. Until they do, I would look elsewhere first at other hotels in the area (i.e. Hotel Burnham or Monaco, Hotel Intercontinental Historic tower, Swissotel, Conrad).", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Tx", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't be Better\u201d", "Author": "cubfanforever", "ReviewID": "UR36842301", "Content": "The Drake really has it all - you're across the street from Oak Street beach, can walk to many great rstaurants, John Hancock is 2 blocks away.

There were some very good aspects, and some very disappointing ones. First, the good ones: -We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking Lake Michigan. It was a beautiful view! -The room was large and nicely furnished. -The Drake Brothers restaurant was excellent for breakfast - great food and great service. And we got a $30 per person voucher for being Diamond members. (Yes, you do need the whole $30 each!) -The location of the hotel is great. In addition to the view, you can easily walk to many shops and restaurants. You don't need a car to experience this part of Chicago. We took a cab from the airport ($25). After our two days at the Drake, we simply walked across the street to the Hertz location at the Westin and rented a car for the rest of our trip. That allowed us to avoid the $50 per day parking fee. -There are several great shops in the hotel. The Mangel Florist shop provided a small bouqet of beautiful red roses for only $25. There was an art gallery with beautiful paintings and a very freindly owner. Don't miss the Lavazza Coffee Shop in the shopping area of the hotel - great coffee, super friendly service (translated: not snooty - see below), awesome sandwiches, and a relaxing atmosphere. And now the disappointments: -The executive lounge is closed until \"late March\" due to \"lack of business\". So definitely don't pay extra for a room on the executive floor hoping to use the lounge. As noted above, the substitute breakfast vouchers work well for breakfast. But check your bill - we were charged for breakfast the first day. -The lobby area is undergoing renovations and much of it is covered with scaffolding and giant sheets of plastic. I notice that's disclosed on their website now, but wasn't when I made my reservation. -The Palm Court Lounge was a disappointment on Saturday afternoon. We did not feel welcome at all and the staff was quite snooty. We got up and left and had a wonderful time in the Lavazza Coffee Shop. I'd recommend the same choice for others. -Check your bill closely. We were charged for breakfast one day when it should have been free, and were also charged for some mini-bar items. And that was before I even realized there was a mini bar. -The bathroom was small and in need of updating. I guess at the end of the day, an old hotel is still an old hotel.

Drake Brothers is a steakhouse, however, they do have a very nice breakfast buffet. Coq D'Or is their small lounge/restaurant where we had lunch. It was very good also. The Palm Court is their other \"bar\" however is also the tea room. They have afternoon tea while a harp plays. It is always very crowded. We went in the evening where they have jazz and it had loads of dancers and was quite crowded also. That evening we decided to try the new Trader Vics which has just opened up after being closed for two years, prior at the Palmer House Hotel. It is just a three block walk from the Drake by Rush St. It was pretty good, however, service was spotty and the food was just so-so. That being said they have a great lounge serving fabulous Mai-Tai's so it is good for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres for sure!

My only complaint is about the parking - it's valet-only, and it's expensive. Just be aware of that if you're driving in. We stayed for one night, and the parking charge was $48! Your best bet would be to find a self-park garage in the area - realistically, you shouldn't pay more than $30 per day to park, so at the very least, you're saving almost $20, if not more.

Hilton has done work to the hotel and continues to do so but they are not going to win the battle with out a major overhaul. Our room was a Gold coast suite with 2 rooms, the average nightly cost for this room is $1,100. Amenities in that room include quite a few things we never had, some simple some pretty major; no bolster pillow, no complimentary beverage, no large arm chair with Ottoman, no turndown service at night, and no newspaper. There is a work area in the suites as well, however there are no light bulbs anywhere in the rooms over 60 watts so its hard to read anything. The hotel was also noisy, the doors are heavy and close hard so every time someone came or left we heard doors slamming. The staff used to be very accommodating but now they are all rather aloof with the exceptions of the maids that stand and chat in the hallways, they always said hello. Our suite had a bathroom with decor out of the 80s and shower mold that appears to have started in the 90s it was so thick. There was also a pop spill all down the wall by our mini fridge that was there when we checked in and was not cleaned up during our whole week stay. The bedroom of the suite and the bathroom also had the distinct smell of vomit which made me have to go buy a strong candle to keep in the room.

Their rate of early departures has to be very high given all the problems we experienced. What problems, you may ask? Our bathroom had black mold on the ceiling. The ceiling in the main room was cracked from the ceiling light fixture all the back to the frame of the wall/ceiling. Every time we open or shut the door to our room, plaster fell on our bed. The carpet was GROSS to the point that we asked for another room due to the mold smell. We were refused another room. There were no coffee mugs. I called at 8AM for a mug and it did not arrive til afternoon (the handle was broken). At 8PM I asked for a CLEAN robe to no avail. I called the front desk at midnight to advise that I had yet to receive a clean robe. Boy they were quick! They brought a roll away bed. HUH!? We were in the gym and asked for extra head sets since there were none on the rack. Again, to no avail. They later explained that they no longer provide head sets due to sanitary concerns. Gee, if they applied the same concern toward their hotel rooms they would not have a black mold problem. If you want to eat breakfast via room service be prepared to wait all morning. We placed our breakfast order for early delivery (7AM). When it finally arrived at 8:30 AM nothing on our plates resembled anything we had ordered. Two bagels on a plate and a bowl of fruit...? Huh!?

It's great to have tea or appetizers in the bar and just watch people come and go. There are several dining options, and though I've heard that Drake Brothers is great for dinner, I've only ever eaten breakfast there. The breakfast is wonderful, though - you can have the buffet or ala carte. I've been to a few banquets and business meetings at the hotel as well, and the food is always better than you would expect for that kind of thing, so I think you can safely give the catering service high marks. Over the years, I've stayed in three different room types - a city view suite, a city view double and a lakeview king. The suite and king were both great. I will say that the city view double was showing its age, but I figure that is to be expected at a grand old hotel. If you want trendy, new furnishings and plasma televisions, go stay at a new hotel. If you want history, grandeur and tradition, stay here. You'll also get REMARKABLE service (which I think is the best reason to stay here).

Second, guest service is rude and pointless. I'm not just talking about the people behind the desk. I'm talking all across the board. The parking attendants. The restaurant servers. The managers. My wife and I couldn't believe it. For example, when we checked in, they put us in room #125. That's on the first floor on the corner of Michigan Ave. & Lake Shore Drive. It is so loud! It's a room that shouldn't even be offered to guests. So we asked if we could switch rooms and instead of giving us another room, they asked if we would rather check out! I asked if the hotel was sold out that evening. They said no. Huh? So, the hotel is not sold out, you have a comparable room available, but you won't let us switch? It was only after asking for the manager, that they put us in a smoking room. And besides the horrible smell, it was just as ugly and old-looking as the first room. Very nice, people. My advice to anybody traveling to Chicago who wants to stay in a nice hotel on Michigan Ave, stay at the Park Hyatt, Marriott or Four Seasons.

The TV was old and only had a small selection of stations. I am a federal government employee and I checked in with a tax exempt form.

It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids. Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. I chose The Drake purely on its reputation, history, celeb status, etc. I did not expect this to be a cheap or budget stay (and was not disappointed!), but I did try some cost-saving measures which The Drake was happy to accommodate (see below). Put simply, I wanted to stay at the famous Drake Hotel in Chicago, regardless of cost. I couldn't seem to get a travel agent who could organise it, so I ended up contacting the hotel itself. I tried email from their website several times early in 2007 (for a December stay), but received no response. As I really wanted to try this hotel, I ended up phoning it from Brisbane, and made the booking that way. The girl I spoke to was very helpful with room options, but despite a promise that I would receive email confirmation, none came. It may have been my \"Strein\" accent. However, when I sought confirmation in November by email, I did get a favourable response promptly by email, and when we arrived at the hotel for our 3 nights, all was in order. One thing to note - we couldn't pre-arrange transfers from Chicago O'Hare airport to the city (the only place in many countries and cities that I haven't been able to), but it was simple enough to arrange a return transfer door-to-door from the transport desk near luggage collection at the airport, and phone in a booking for the return journey. The Drake is an old and impressive building, with views of Lake Michigan. Great foyer. It was all I'd hoped for in that regard. It is very well located - close to shops (including Macy's) and restaurants (some great and reasonably priced Irish pubs - we ate twice at the close-by Dublin Pub it was so good - and it is also close to a great pancake place - The Original Pancake House - where we had breakfast every morning). Some of our best meals were in Chicago. The Drake is also virtually next door to the enormous John Hancock Centre (you can view The Drake from the top). Very convenient location. We had a Junior Suite with two bathrooms, which would have been superb for less people. It had 2 comfortable queen sized beds, couch and chair, desk and chair, TV unit with drawers, closet, room safe, minibar, ethernet, and two enormous bathrooms (I'd say the best bathrooms on the trip). As there were 5 of us, we also took 2 trundle beds (my cost-cutting measure) at no cost (that I'm aware of). The staff were helpful in that regard. That meant everyone had a separate bed, but it was cosy, and the two extra beds (which stood upright during the day) took up a lot of floor space at night. We had windows but were too low down for a good view. The room was quite austere - very Hilton - but nothing to complain about. Reception/check-in was fine, as was check out, and the staff helpful with maps, etc. We did a city tour with an ex-Chicago cop as a bus driver/tour guide, which was very entertaining. We later changed buses to go to the John Hancock Centre (which was the last stop on our tour). Both drivers were happy to stop the bus and open the doors to let me take photos. Afterwards, when we were supposed to be returned to our hotel (remember - just around the corner from the John Hancock Centre), that bus driver was kind enough to take us all the way to the Sears Tower, even though he was under no obligation to do so. Just us 5 in the big coach - he earned his tip for that! At the Sears Tower, the bus driver (at his own suggestion) got out of the bus, lay on his back on the sidewalk and took photos of us 5 with the Sears Tower towering above us. Very friendly folk in Chicago. One girl passing in the street offered us help to find the Dublin Pub without being asked, simply because she'd heard us mention it . Lake Michigan was an awesome sight in winter. I recommend the free zoo at Lincoln Park.

Its purely a grand classic from the wooden elivators with the cushy couchs and fresh fruit at every stop to shoe shines in the lavatorys. The Hotels grand lobby is decorated with fine Italian furnature and everything is always spotless and in perfect shape. The only I can compare it to is Buckingham palace. Its a classic!

There was a large sitting area and large closet and wet bar. Additionally, there were two pulldown beds that sprung from the wall. It was a bit odd and it wasted a lot of space, as we did not need the extra beds. The bathroom, though well appointed, was quite small and that extra space would have helped there.

Unfortunately, the armoire that contained the tv was in a location such that you could not see the tv from the bed, which is rather inconvenient.

If you think the Drake loves their Hilton Honors member, you will be sadly disappointed. Judging by the reviews and photos posted on this site, we know that the Drake treats their Priceline customers better! Read on: Upon check in, we learned we would have to move after the first 2 nights, because we had booked our extra night in a different category of room than the room booked using our Hilton Honors points (we politely asked if we might be assigned to one room for our entire stay but were told no). Our 1st room was on the 5th floor, off a very small corridor, next to a fire escape. In fact, the fire escape platform was literally attached to our window. We also had a view of the mechanical system, but nothing else. The room itself was very tiny, and the carpet in the room was badly stained and soiled. There was mold growing around the shower bar and soap dish, and the tile grout looked like it needed some scrubbing. There was some fresh fruit and chocolate in the room to welcome us, and since we knew the hotel was fully booked for the evening, we settled in. The first evening, I hardly slept at all due to the air conditioner. It was a warm evening and every time the air conditioner fan turned off there was a loud Bang! It literally made me jump out of bed a couple of times during the night. I finally turned off the fan altogether and slept awhile. At 8am I called the front desk and asked for a new room or to have the maintenance people fix the AC. No offer for a new room, but maintenance did arrive within minutes and fixed the banging AC. We also asked for a morning paper (there's a note in the room saying one can be requested), but never received one once while we stayed in the 1st room. Fresh towels arrived one evening long after we had requested them, and long after I had wandered the halls to find them myself. Believe me, we felt pretty invisible and ignored! Kind of Harry Potter-ish. On the 3rd day, we were required to pack up all our belongings so that we could be moved to the room we had booked for our final evening. When we returned to the hotel that evening our bags had been moved to a large and lovely lakeview room. The carpet was clean, the bathroom was clean. There was no comparison between the rooms, in fact, at the moment we walked in to the 2nd room we realized how truly awful the first room was. And to think that we used a bundle of Honors points on a room that should not have been given to anyone! On the third day we were also told about the amenities available to Hiltons Honors members, although that information had not been shared previously. It was like all of a sudden they realized we were Diamond members. Too little, too late. On a better note, we had breakfast in the hotel, and it was wonderful. The maintenance people were prompt and efficient in fixing the AC problem when they were notified. The maids were friendly and polite.

The party walls between rooms are crackerbox thin. There is no sound insulation. At the Drake, we heard our neighbors cough, sneeze, belch, pass gas, and rustle plastic bags. We heard their conversations and their TV sounds, even when the neighbors were reasonably quiet and considerate. This problem goes both ways: This is not a romantic hotel, since your neighbors will hear all of your lovemaking sounds! 2. If you are in Chicago when room heating is required, including early April, bring a portable space heater, or stay elsewhere. The Drake's ancient ductwork blows cool air directly onto the bed.

My boyfriend thinks I am nuts but that is another story...haha. In all my experiences at the Drake this doesn't happen - I have to search for flaws and if found they are minute. The Drake is a wonderful hotel that is comfortable, very clean, has the old-world elegant feel to it. I tend to stay in mainly at 4* hotels (Westins, Sheratons, etc.) and I will pay a premium for location, comfort, & amenities/luxury. I stayed here once on business for 2 weeks in 2003 and thoroughly enjoyed the service, level of comfort & location. I love these old Grand Dame hotels - hotels like the Plaza in NYC & the Royal York in Toronto, and such. Ones that were built in the early 1900s and that are chock full of beautiful architectural details and have hosted Kings and Queens. The Drake is no exception. I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago this weekend and despite the fact I knew I'd get a much newer room with a glitzier lobby & perhaps more trend at the Ritz or Four Seasons or Park Hyatt but I opted for the relaxed, old school hotel with good service with a smile from the staff at the Drake. There is nothing to compare it to in Chicago. Take a look at my pictures! A few highlights: -we got a great deal on a Deluxe King room - $175 per night versus $300+ for the 5* hotels in town. -great location on the \"Miracle (shopping) Mile\" on Michigan, overlooking Lake Shore Drive and the lake. Our room had a view onto the lake, one block away from the John Hancock Tower. -super comfortable Hilton beds (this is a Hilton hotel after all) -elegant yet comfortable room furnishings -the bathroom was OK but large and slightly uninspired, BUT the towels were I think the softest I have used in any hotel in the past few years -the bath towels & bathrobes were sooo soft & comfortable which was a nice surprise -the concierge couldn't be nicer & went out of her way to help us with finding a local hair salon for my partner & getting me an umbrella so I could make a after dinner run to the Cheesecake Factory (a guilty pleasure of mine) for some dessert. -free breakfast with the Hilton Honors program was included in our reservation - though the buffet was 6.5 out of 10 (though the French Toast was delicious!) it did include all the basics, including a chef preparing fresh omelettes. If you're going to stay at the 5* in Chicago, the Four Seasons or Ritz, go ahead because the Drake won't surpass them in terms of luxury or swankiness. Can some of the in-room furnishings be updated, yes, can the bathroom have heated towel racks, yes. But if you want a beautiful historical 4* hotel with beautiful public spaces, excellent restaurants, solid service (with a smile), very very affordable luxury, very comfortable and elegant rooms, and an unbeatable location, stay at the Drake.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cVery good but not up to par with other 4-star hotels in the area\u201d", "Author": "troubadourNYC", "ReviewID": "UR6555740", "Content": "Comparing this hotel to other 4-star hotels in Chicago, as well as the 3-star Palmer House, I found the Drake to be very good overall but lacking in a few areas.

Also, there were some ugly stains on the curtains and wall paper.

Later, I spoke to a second concierge and she found me some, but I was a little unhappy that several staff members turned me away so easily. Other four-star hotels would have made more of an effort in little matters like this. So overall, the Drake is a fine hotel.

From the minute we arrive from the airport, we are greeted enthusiastically by the front door staff, and the bellman.

But the personal service has made up for this over and over. All the staff is friendly. The food in the Executive Club Lounge is excellent, and you would be hard pressed to find a better view--anywhere enjoying a light breakfast or early evening cocktails.

After checking rates, we found the Drake for $139+tax on a Friday night - a great deal, given the location and the fact that other hotels in the area - Four Seasons, Ritz, Park Hyatt, Peninsula - are in the $300-$500/nt range. After reading the reviews and knowing a bit of the Drake's past, we expected a grande dame, but showing a bit of her age. Well, she does, but don't let it discourage you. First, the hotel exudes old world charm of a bygone era - from the beautiful lobby with it's enormous floral display (being replaced when we arrived with an abundance of lillies, reminding us of our wedding day) to the classic fountain in the Palm Court, to the classic furnishing in the rooms. As for the room, we showed our Hilton Honors card (sign up online before you stay), and were rewarded with an automatic upgrade to a deluxe room with a sitting area. We asked, and we were told that the room would face the Drake Tower. In other words, a view of a brick wall. We instead used the \"upgrade\" for a standard room with a lake view, and were given a beautifully appointed, traditional room looking out over Lake Shore Drive and Oak Street Beach. The night we stayed there, it snowed a magnificent 4-5 inches of heavy, wet snow, clinging to the tree branches and light posts, and the view was truly wonderful. The bed was comfortable, with lots of down pillows and a comfortable duvet. The only downside - no flat sheet. As a traveler wary of hotel bedspreads/comforters (having seen too many Datelines on the subject), it was a little unneverving, but the linens were crisp, blindingly white, and appeared to be new, so no hesitatation. The bathroom is also a bit of the older type, but good water pressure, standard Gilchrest & Soames products, and perfectly cleaned (not a streak on the mirrors or polished granite floor tile). Another bonus of signing up for the Hilton Honors program was the free breakfast vouchers for the Drake Bros. restaurant. Skip the buffet - we ordered off the menu and it was delicious (scrambled eggs with smoked salmon on an english muffin and lox and bagels with fresh tomato slices, ripe red onion, and abundance of fresh, deliciously salty capers). We expected to be charged for the fresh squeezed OJ and coffee we ordered in addition to our meals and were pleasantly surpised when our waiter smiled and said \"no sir, we appreciate you staying here, it is all taken care of.\" It was a wonderful, albeit too brief stay at a wonderful old school hotel that still has it all together. Yes, the walls may be bit thin (the neighbors were quiet, although we got back into the room late - remember, we only had one kid-free night to enjoy ourselves) and the chair rails and furniture may be dinged here and there, but the location, the oozing charm, and the value can't be beat.

Service was formal but not stuffy, and the concierge was a wizard. Even the elevators are romantic. With loveseats, no less. The hotel's Coq d'Or bar was the first to open at the end of Prohibition and is still a great place to meet for early-evening drinks. The bar at the Palm Court feels surprisingly intimate despite being only a few steps up from the iconic lobby - which was decorated to the nines for Christmas, with carved Venetian angels near the ceiling and a magnificent tree.

There was an interminable line at the check-in counter, which really wasn't prepared to handle the quantity of guests that they had. Housekeeping was very disorganized. They were still making their rounds cleaning the rooms at 5 o'clock. When I got back from dinner at about 9, the door had been left open at the supplies station on my floor, with various cleaning products left lying out in the hall. There was also a bed (yes, a whole bed), sitting out half-blocking the hallway. It was there for at least a few hours, but gone by the next morning. The room had a somewhat pleasing \"classic luxury hotel\" decor, but it was clearly in need of renovation. The ugly green carpeting was really filthy, and in need of replacement. There was ample closet space, but only about four small drawers, which were in the big piece of furniture that also held the TV. The TV was mounted on a sliding platform that didn't slide out far enough, so that you couldn't rotate it to see the screen from the bed, or the couch, or anywhere else you might want to watch TV from. The cheesy simulated wood laminate that had been applied to this piece of furniture was stained in a few places, and cracked and peeling off in another. There was a safe in the room, but it was locked shut when I arrived, so I couldn't use it. The wallpaper was sort of old and faded, and, in one place, some crusty, reddish-brown fluid had been splattered onto it -- blood, perhaps? The bathroom had some marble in it, which was nice. The sink was partially clogged, and drained very slowly. The towels were thin and poorly absorbent, and had such a rough, uncomfortable surface that I felt like I might get abrasions trying to dry myself off. The worst thing of all: the noise! Besides a slightly annoying level of noise from Michigan Avenue, there was a locked door connecting my room to the one next door, and I could hear even normal-level conversation as though the people next door were three feet from my head. I got very little sleep at the Drake. Soundproof walls are my most important consideration in choosing a hotel, and this one was awful in that respect. On the plus side: The bed was very comfortable, with a wonderful down or down-like comforter. The air conditioning was plenty strong. Several concierges were excellent.

That was unpleasant, but being so late, we just didn't really have the strength to complain and change rooms - though we probably should have. The only other problem we had was strange noises in the hallway, which we realized was due to a service elevator being across from our room. The noises did not happen during the night, so it's not like it kept us awake. Other than that, the shower could use some updating - we started running out of hot water after only 2 showers.

They managed to check us in early since we arrived earlier than anticipated. We were in our room by 10 a.m. We sat in the tea room for awhile before check in and that was very relaxing. The bathroom in that tearoom is like no other I've been in. Each stall is like an individual bathroom. The toilet paper and kleenex are always folded to a point no matter where you go. There is some magical fairy that has this job of making them pointed when your not looking. I never want to stay anywhere else when we are in Chicago.

Sinatra's favorite. Staff is great, 4 restaraunts are great, water pressure is outstanding. Offered a $30.00 upgrade to room with sitting area per night. Declined but will take them up on that tomorrow night. Rooms are small, as to be expected in a historic hotel, but I'm sitting here surrounded by thousands of dollars of furnishings, wall work, heavy wooden panelled door, etc. This is a subtle but important note as I sit back and notice things. If I look around my room and ask \"could this be a guest room in a Southern Plantation, or Rhode Island Mansion?\" my answer is Yes. When I ask that at the Hilton/Hyatt/Marriott, my answer is No. Then I ask myself, \"how many days do I have on this planet? how many days do I want to be in a generic box?\" Internet is $11.40/day. View: Lake Michigan or City, ask at desk. I took the Lake, and have nothing between me and the lake but one road. No buildings, this hotel is on the lake. Large window says \"Caution Do Not Open\", to appease the lawyers living amongst us. I slid the window up 4 feet last night. When was the last time you slid a hotel window up? Especially a new dark stained aluminum double paned window? No screws or restrictors. Gotta like a place that still says \"don't do that\" but lets you be an American with the choice to do so if you want. Phone system is nice. Set wake up call for 6:30am. Heard it, ignored it, rolled over. Went off a second time, ignored it, rolled over. Security knocked on my door 15 minutes later, \"Security, just wanted to make sure you received your wake up call\". I was extremely impressed that they knew part of their job is to make sure I make it to my early meeting! The bar says they served the 2nd drink in Chicago after Prohibition ended. 4 internal high end restaraunts. Right on the shopping wonderland known as the Magnificent Mile, across from Bloomindales. If you're tired of generic Hyatt/Hilton/Marriott experiences and want a change, try the Drake.

People who pay in full won't get what they pay for. It was fun to be in the lobby of an \"older\" city hotel as opposed to the bland environment of so many chain establishments. Some Chicago businesses had advertising displays in cabinetlike niches. Uniformed bellhops bustled about. A towering, decorated tree heralded the holiday season along with an electric-train layout. The entire area was nicely paneled, carpeted, and appointed. Too bad we went upstairs. . The \"family room\" proved to have a good-sized double bed and nothing more for sleeping. (The couch didn't fold out.) Without our having to wait all that long, a surly employee brought up a cot which turned out to have a somewhat lumpy mattress. Fortunately we were only there one night. Space in the room was adequate. The mirror and glass shelves above the minibar provided a nice touch. The bathroom was roomy and clean. Furnishings were OK aside from the lumpy cot and cheesy radio. There was a decent view of Michigan Avenue to be had from the large windows. Dinner was served in a pleasing atmosphere with efficient, swift, and congenial servers.

We made a reservation two months in advance for a suite and a king room, we gave our credit card number at the time of our reservation (so that they could immediately charge us for the rooms-which they explained was a necessity so that we could receive their \"special\" rate -- how many other luxury hotels do you know that resort to charging you up front for a discount?) In good faith, we proceeded and were given a confirmation number. Trusting that the Drake was a reputable hotel with competent staff, we felt assured that our reservation was complete. The evening of our arrival, 9:30 in the evening, we were informed by the desk staff that our reservation had been cancelled. By whom? We had no idea, nor did they. We gave them our confirmation number and it was not accepted. The management was consulted, but refused to speak to us. The help was left to settle the situation. With few options at hand, we were forced to ask for any rooms available. We were given 10'x10' \"closets\" with views of the roof tops and pigeon poop. Not only were the rooms small, they had bath drains that did not work, complete with extra hair from the last guest to prove it, less than adequate air conditioning, that kept you up at night and sounded like the worst motel unit you have ever experienced, and finally, the towels were like rubbing yourself with dried parsley. We were never contacted by the management during our stay and at check out we were handed a bill that would have equalled ANY stay in the BEST room at a REAL hotel in Chicago. The end of my story is do yourself a favor and stay at the Ritz, the Four Seasons, or ANY other hotel that knows how to treat and respect their client.", "Date": "June 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cNot so \"drake\" as I,d dreamed...\u201d", "Author": "Trufa", "ReviewID": "UR2190869", "Content": "We were a party of 6, in 3 twin bed rooms from May 29th to June 3rd. 2 rooms were quite OK but the 3rd was so small and facing a wall that we complained and after much begging were given a half lakeview one (3rd floor).

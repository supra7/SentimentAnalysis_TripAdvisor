The individual went to the laundry room to check for himself and the reported to me exactly what i told him. He did not volunteer to refund my money. When I asked, he told me that I am going to need to take this up with the people that own the machines. There was no apology. It was I that suggested that a sign be placed on the machine so that no one else falls victim to this. I had called when I made the reservation to find out that they had laundry facilities knowing that I was going to need to launder clothes for the second half of my trip so this is a great disappointment.

We chose Red Roof because of the low price and free shuttle to the airport since we only needed a place to stay for 10 hours. The hotel states that they have a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to and from the airport from 5am-1am. We waited almost 45minutes to get picked up and then in the morning when we arrived in the lobby at 5am to get on the shuttle for our 6:45am flight the driver decided to not show up for work. The hotel staff called and he said he would arrive by 5:40a and then showed up at 6am causing us and another passenger to miss our flights. The $110 that we payed for the night was not worth the extra loses from missing our flight. Also the hotel was not anything special. We were placed in the 2nd building with a broken elevator where we had to cross a boarded up hall under construction that was full of trash to get to the other working elevator. Our room was fine for a quick nights stay as long as you dont mind holes in the bedding and dont want to shower. The shower was covered in soap scum and limescale. The area outside is nowhere that you want to walk at night with loud drunks falling down. Overall we normally dont mind staying in a less than optimal hotel for a quick overnight flight but in this case it was definitely not worth it.

Lauderdale, we had received prompt and courteous communications back from their General Manager David Blevins who was so helpful and very friendly however he advised us prior to booking his hotel did not offer transfers to port of Miami and only went to everglades so unfortunately we decided not to stay. Big Mistake. Red Roof Inn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c One word\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Disgusting !!!! I am defiantely a glass is half full kind of a person but not when it comes to this hotel. I can say Red Roof Inn is by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. We only booked this purely because we were travelling on Allure of The Seas the following day and when looking online we noticed that the hotel offered complimentary airport transfers as well as transfers the following day to the cruise port. As our cruise was departing from Port Of Miami not Port Everglades My husband called from Australia just to make sure they would take us there which we were told yes. My husband made a few attempts to book via email however communication was very slow and poor so he decided to book online using a booking site. This should of been alarm bells to us but we decided to go ahead purely because of the transfers. So the night before we arrived into Miami we actually phone front desk from San Francisco and asked them if we needed to let them know our flight times in order to pick us up for the transfers. The person on the front desk advised no and that a shuttle went to and from the airport every 30 minutes. Ok no problem sounded like it was all going to be ok.... Well it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Our 6 hour flight was long and tiring, we collected our baggage from the carrousel approx 9:20 pm, it took is about 10 minutes to get up to the next level and were at the pick-up zone by 9:30 - We figured we possibly may have just missed the bus on its loop and thought it must have been there at either 9.15 or just before 9.30 so thought the next one would be around sometime soon perhaps - 9.45 or 10.00. All other shuttles were going round and round - some passing us over 2 or 3 times and soon we were the last people standing waiting. At 10.15 we decided enough was enough and decided to call the hotel. The person on the phone told us the bus had only just left 10 minutes ago and should be there soon. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until about 10.40 that our shuttle finally rocked up - over an hour waiting at the pick-up zone. When the driver dropped us at the hotel we proceeded to check in and noticed that the driver parked the bus and walked over the television and was watching the baseball game that was on - It all started to make sense and we realised that as the drive only took 5 minutes to get there we were obviously lied to by getting told that the bus had left 10 minutes ago and should be there any minute. The whole time he was probably standing watching the baseball and if we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of called we would of still been waiting. As it was after we called it still took 25 minutes to come and get us and for a 5 minute journey with absolutely no traffic it was evident that there was no haste to come and collect us. I really hope no other suckers were waiting to be picked up after us because about half and hour after we checked in we went back through the foyer to try and find somewhere to get something to eat and book our transfers to port of miami for the following day and the driver was in the same position watching the baseball still....TERRIBLE! For the port transfers we advised our cruise, the port and the time we had to be there and the guy just told us to write our name on the list and to be ready for collection at 12. Secondly the room - it smelly DISGUSTING and when we opened the door there were about 30 or so pamphlets that were thrown under the door to various takeaway to gambling - there were also loads of scattered sheets of paper all down the hall way - obviously they just let anyone in off the street up near the rooms to put whatever paraphernalia under their door. Walking from the check in building out to our building where our room was we passed a bunch of thugs sitting around the complex looking like they were up to no good. Unsure if they were guests or just using the place as a hang out they made us feel very uncomfortable and somewhat unsafe. Thirdly woke up the next morning with bites sporadic bites over me. I slept under the covers and later realised I had been bitten by bed bugs. This made me feel so sick and dirty - I was just beside myself. Lastly but not least... We proceed down to the foyer, check out in plenty of time for our 12.00 transfers to Port Of Miami to find out that they have too many people and we had to wait until 1pm. Although we were miffed we still politely and patiently waited and then at 1pm the next shuttle came, we loaded our luggage on the bus and the driver asked which terminal - we told him and he apologised but said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Port Of Miami and only went to the Port Everglades and thought we would have been told this. He felt really bad knowing he turned us away over an hour ago for the first shuttle as he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit us on the first bus then having to tell us this bad news. He said we would have to get a taxi which would cost $80 and took us into the front desk where my husband spoke to the desk who were unable to help us with anything apart from calling us a taxi. We had to be at our port by 2.00pm and were told its about a 40 minute drive so had no time to argue but told them how incredibly angry we were and left. So all in all this was the WORST inn / hotel whatever you want to call it we have EVER stayed in. All we really cared that it was clean, comfortable and included our transfers as stated and advised. Each and every aspect failed. Clean - FAILED !! - Bed bugs and bad smells ! Airport Transfers - FAILED !! We had to wait 1 hour and 10 minutes for a transfer that apparently is available without bookings required at least every 30 minutes. After a long commute this was horrendous. Port Transfers - FAILED !!! The ONLY reason we even booked here and ended up having to ensure all of this was because we were advised they would drop us at OUR port, we specifically mentioned OUR port at least 3 times so evidentially they do not know the concept of listening. The whole nights stay here was completely futile and ended up costing us more money by having to by itch cream as a result of the bed bugs, having to pay for a night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accommodation in a dirty hovel and then having to pay $80 for a taxi when we were told they would take us to Port of Miami but then didnt. Due to their lack of listening and communication by not telling us they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to our port also resulted in us running late for our cruise check in.

Still, we were worried about staying for so long, but we were pleasantly surprised! The service was friendly and efficient and we were impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of the rooms. It's no luxury, but it's adequate, especially for the price. There is a small shop selling, snacks, drinks and toiletries among other bits and bobs, and a cash machine. We also used the pool which is decent considering the hotel is not really meant for long stay. As I said, the hotel is mainly aimed as a short stop-over for travellers (which it is perfect for). Having said that, it served as a perfectly adequate base for our whole stay in Miami, during which we were mostly out and about anyway. The only thing I would criticise is the breakfast. It is a very basic continental breakfast limited to bagels and toast (with jam, cream cheese or butter), apples and tea, coffee, apple and orange juice (that is literally it!). Again, it's fine if you are only eating it for one day, not so good for us eating it for 5 days straight! But then we just got breakfast out instead some days.

I made a huge mistake booking into the red roof inn at Miami airport. We turned up on spec to be told they only had rooms with a king size bed available. They then quoted us the same amount as what I'd pay at a Hilton. When I challenged them they told me they wouldn't budge on the rate so i started to walk out the door. They then suddenly found a (significantly) cheaper room with queen beds......the room was the furthest possible away from reception and when we walked in it was like walking into a walk in freezer. The a/c machine was on full blast. We turned it off but as we couldnt open the window nor put any heating on so I spent the evening sat in a coat. Totally crazy. One of the attractions of the inn is that it offered free wi-fi. When I tried to access on my blackberry it I got to the log in page but then it just kept looping back when I clicked the log in button. I reported this to reception who told me the wi-fi didn't work on blackberries. This is despite all their marketing materials in the inn stating that any wi-fi enabled equipment could use the free wi-fi.

We would be arriving the day before the cruise nd only need a place to rest for 1 night. I read about this hotel online and decided to take a chance on it and it far exceeded my expectations. The hotel is located just outside the Miami Airport and they have a free shuttle which departs the terminal every 30 miniutes giving you door to door service between the airport and the hotel at no cost. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by very friendly staff and there was no problem with them finding our reservation. At check in we asked about the free shuttle to the port of Miami where our cruise would be leaving from the next day and we were instructed to write our names down to reserve our spot on the shuttle. This also was an easy process. I was suprised to see a convieniece store in the lobby. The prices were marked up but they had anything you could need or that you may have forgot to pack. We then proceeded to our room. The hallways were nothnig to rave about but upon entering the room we were pleasantly suprised. The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms have been updated the bed was very soft and the room smelled clean. We also noticed security gates protecting the parking lot and a secruity guard was always makig rounds. We felt very safe. They have a nice pool although we did not swim. That night we got hungry and found an excellent authentic cuban restaraunt called Latin Cafe 2000 also right by the airport. The food was amazing and gave us a nice taste of Miami. There are also other places to eat in the area which would be a short cab ride away if you were not driving. We actually had rented a car for the night because we wanted to see Miami as I mentioned before the parking lot is protected by security gates so we felt very safe leaving our rental care there. The morning of the cruise we woke up and tried the continental breakfast which consisted of bagels, danishes, fruit, coffee, cappacuino, apple juice, and orange juice. it was your tyipical continental breakfast nothing to rave about. We needed to return our rental car to the airport so we drove it there and dropped it off then took the rental car shuttle to the terminal and then the hotel shuttle back to the hotel. It was a very easy process. Check out is at 1230 and the free shuttle for the cruise leaves at 1 so we waited in the lobby for a short period of time to be called. The shuttle arrived and we got to the port with no problem and had a fantasic cruise. I also forgot to mention they do have FREE WI-FI throughout the hotel. Next time we cruise from Miami we will stat here again it is an excellent precruise hotel or if you need an affordable one night stay. If your are having an extended stay or seeking a vacation hotel I would probablly try one of the other hotels in the area. but if you are cruising or just stopping over in miami and looking for something affordable this is your best bet.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Salvador, El Salvador", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel when you want to live the Miami experience!\u201d", "Author": "JorgeSalo", "ReviewID": "UR74800509", "Content": "My family and I needed a place to stay in which we would feel free to experience Miami at our will.

The shuttle driver was so friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick and the people at the desk were also friendly. It was our first cruise and we were unsure about the shuttle the next morning. They helped us get signed up for the shuttle to the port the next day and kept us informed the next morning when the time changed. They also gave us a later check-out time so we could swim later and wait for the shuttle to the port in our room. They pointed the way to Bennigan's and we were grateful to have a restaurant so close since it was after 8:00 PM when we arrived. Each of us ordered something different and we all enjoyed our meals. They have very good sandwiches and cold beers - what more can you ask for! Prices were comparable to other restaurants of this type (mid-price range). There is not alot of other things to do in the area from what we could tell but we were satisfied with dinner next door and swimming in the pool. The room was rather plain but it was clean and had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable, the air conditioner worked well and the price was great. We were only given two bath towels and there were four of us so check on that before you need them. The pool was WONDERFUL - nice size pool, warm water and very clean! The planes go overhead but we didn't hear them at night and it was fun to watch them while we were at the pool in the morning. There was a free continental breakfast which had bagels, danish, fruit and juice. Not the most elaborate breakfast but the coffee was good and my 6'2\" boys and husband were satisfied.

Towels, soap and shampoo were also satisfactory. The parking is a bit strange- the entrance is on the north side (the other side is barricaded) and controlled by an automatic gate. I guess it gives some security in that you can not leave or enter in a hurry. The only down side I noticed (I reported this) was the endless sheets of pizza shop advertising pushed under the door.

My brother-in-law booked this hotel for $140 per night, as we needed a place to stay prior to our cruise, and most hotels with better reviews were fully booked. I was somewhat concerned, but given that the SuperBowl was approaching, and most hotels were fully booked, we didn't really have much of a choice. One other factor that aided in our decision making was that the hotel provided free breakfast, and transportation to the port, which would be a great saving considering we were traveling as a group. First of all, I'll start with the airport shuttle which arrived shortly after we exited the terminal. The driver informed us that the luggage storage to the exterior of the bus was not operational, and so we had to load all of our luggage onto the bus itself. This was surely a safety hazard as we (all other passengers incl my family) would not be able to the bus in an emergency due to the amount of luggage blocking the exit. The driver did not seem concerned and thankfully the ride took a short time i.e. all of about 10 minutes. When we arrived at the hotel, the check in process was a nightmare. Let me explain... there were two people at the desk and a lot of people arriving. The employees at the desk were dealing with multiple phone calls, and departing guests, who understanably did not want to wait in line - with the sheer number of guests arriving - to seek assistance. After about 30 minutes we were checked into our rooms. I looked around the hotel lobby, and was at this point beginning to develop concern over the potential state of the rooms. I went to grab a cup of complimentary coffee, and was greeted by a table with dirty cups, a very stained table cloth, and three coffee pots that were either cold or empty. Next we scheduled the morning transportation to the port, and were informed by the front desk that we would be called in the morning close to the departure time. We were assigned rooms in the second building toward the rear of the hotel. Unfortunately, during the check-in process my husband had developed an allergic reaction to his sickness patch, and so we asked reception to provide information on the local hospital. We were checked in and assigned rooms in the second building. To get to the second building you need to walk past the lobby, dining and pool area. Once we got into the building the mildew smell immediately hit us, in addition to the state of the floors, walls, and the obvious lack of maintenance. Because of the urgency, we put our bags in the room, and called the local hospital. As I put the paper down by the counter to write the details of the hospital, I was shocked to find it covered in flees. I called my family and immediately told them to remove any luggage from the floors, and to set everything on the suitcase stand provided. During the call my husband noticed that the second bed in our room was not made up completely and was showing the box spring and mattress. I walked over to the mattress to see what the large black/reddish area was on the mattress, and low and behold it was COVERED in bed bug fecal matter, and dead bed bugs. Thankfully, we did not have our luggage on the beds per the guidance of my family, as this pest can be carried from one place to another in luggage and on clothing. My mother-in-law said that the only way she could sleep in her room was with the assistance of Tylenol PM. My husband and I stayed at the hospital for most of the night while my husband was treated, and as I mentioned the hotel to the Dr, he mentioned that he had heard really bad things about the hotel,and even offered us a single bed for the night! Thankfully, my husband was okay, but we were both dreading returning to the hotel. Once we arrived at the hotel, we sat outside by the pool until we just couldn't stay up any longer i.e. around 5 a.m. where I was surprised to find several other guests who couldn't sleep in their rooms for various reasons including bed begs, smells, and broken air conditioners. When we did return to the room we slept in our clothes, on top of the top sheet. Yes, the sheet you should typically remove as it doesn't get washed!! As soon as I woke up the next morning, Iliterally left the room within minutes. I didn't take a shower, brush my teeth or do anything, and quite frankly I wouldn't risk it for fear of picking up something. I had brush-ups and we brushed our teeth outside the hotel. The next morning (thankfully time to check out) we were met in the lobby but a sea of guests all trying to cram into the breakfast area. The breakfast i.e. a bagel, or Danish (single wrapped), and tea or coffee wasn't impressive at all, but we were just grateful to be leaving the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so we thought........ The line outside for the port transportation was long, and people were accumulating quickly. When the first bus arrived the hotel personnel were quietly saying the names of guests, and so many didn't even realize they were supposed to be on the shuttle to the port. People without their names on the list we being allowed onto the bus, and as a result the crowd became somewhat disorderly with people shouting and screaming at each other and hotel staff. Of course, the fact that the luggage area was broken did not help. When we did finally get on the shuttle (approximately 1 hour later) I was asked if I would mind sitting on my husband's lap. My sister-in-law was also asked to sit on her husband's lap. I asked the driver how we would exit in an emergency, and he joked about it. Thankfully, I noticed that the back window is an emergency exit.

This hotel shares what is a very common problem of MOST Miami hotels wether they be a 1 to 5 star,CLEANLINESS is definately NOT of paramount concern.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami airport", "Title": "\u201cIt was great\u201d", "Author": "arpobodyshop", "ReviewID": "UR48820485", "Content": "I really like the hotel.

You have a shuttle that picks you up at the airport and another shuttle that takes you to the cruise ship the next day. There are three shuttles that go.

The smell in my room was positively awful, like someone had urinated on the rug or something. The carpet had obviously not been vacuumed as I noticed little pieces of plastic that hold tags on new clothing lying on the floor by my bed, just laying where someone had left them after cutting them off the new clothes. I then sat at the desk and noticed rings on it like a coffee cup would make after it is set down, no one had bothered to wipe them off after the last guest left! So I wiped the desk off myself with a wash cloth. The elevators were positively frightening and ancient, jerking and banging all the way up and down; they did not seem safe at all and I just prayed that nothing would happen while I was riding in them. I was on the 5th floor and so I had to use them. The staff were absolutely rude, I called the hotel from the Mall of the Americas to get directions however the woman who answered could not give me any that I could understand. Her Spanish accent was so thick that when she spoke English I could not understand what she was saying at all. Even with my limited understanding of Spanish I could understand her better when she spoke that. I asked her if there was someone else there who could give me directions and she said \"No\"; and that was the end of the conversation. I ended up calling the 1-800 number for Red Roof Inns to get directions! And once I had them, it was not hard to find at all; shouldn't have been that hard for the Spanish lady to give them to me. And I have to mention the restaurant next door! I was happy to see a Bennigan's right next door, within walking distance, so I went over and ordered shrimp tempura. Oh what a surprise! I got a plate with 8 small, fried shirmp on it, like you would buy in a frozen food package at the grocery store, not what I have been served as shrimp tempura before at all. And a big lump of mashed potatoes on the plate completed the $14 dinner! I had to ask the waiter to bring me shrimp cocktail sauce, he didn't even know what it was and had to go and ask; I also had to ask him to bring me butter for the mashed potatoes. He seemed like he had never waited a table before in his life and I was his first customer ever! I was already praying that I would get through the night safely with the hotel the way it was, then overheard staff talking to another customer that it really wasn't a Bennigan's restaurant at all, just in name only and it was now under 'new management'. I ate the shrimp and began to eat the mashed potatoes when I noticed a 2 inch long by 1/4 inch wide strip of clear plastic in them!!! That was the last straw and when I showed the restaurant host the piece of plastic that I had found in the mashed potatoes he replied 'Aw that's not gonna hurt you!' He was a trailer-trash looking and acting type of guy. My waiter was more understanding and let me just leave without paying for the dinner saying 'don't worry about it'; so at least I was thankful for that. Remarkably I did sleep well in the stinky room and even though the airplanes from Miami Airport fly right over the top of the place they didn't bother me at all. I can only think that it was my prayers that got me safely through the night at this awful place.

This hotel is good if you need a room 5 minutes away from the airport. We slept very well and did not hear an airplane. The free shuttle of the hotel works very good. You don't have to give a phonecall on arrival, because every 30 minutes the shuttle goes to the airport for pickup, excepted some hours in the middle of the night. In the morning we had to go to the office of Avis for pick up of our hired car, and the shuttle brought us to the entrance of the office, so very convenient. The room itself was clean enough, but does not look as nice as on the pictures on internet. In the corners were some big holes in the wall and the bathroom lacks some finishing touch. There is no coffeemaker in the room. Breakfast has little choice, but enough to start the day and there is a nice terrace at the breakfast area, so you can take the breakfast outside if you like.

Those were gone so early because they probably put out a dozen and that was it. I specifically checked on the availability of the shuttle service to the port since our group was large. They told us it would be no problem and that we should be ready at the pool at 11:00. Only 12 or so people could go on each shuttle trip and there was only one bus. By the way, the bus had a flat tire and the driver drove us all around town to try and fill up the tire. We were the first group to go to the pier. The rest of our group had to wait almost 3 hours to get the pier. The bathroom in the lobby ran out of toilet paper and these poor people had to sit out in the hot Miami sun for a long time with no water or anything. It was a joke. I called the general manager of the hotel when we returned from our cruise. He denied any problems with the hotel. After months of wrangling with the general manager and the corporate office, we were able to get a refund for all of our group members. Very poor service and dirty rooms.

I didn't want anything too fancy or expensive however I wanted comfort and conveincence. Since I was booking my hotel last minute due to unexpected changes in travel plans and it was the busiest time of year, I had few choices. I decided on the Red Roof Inn which is close to the Miami International Airport. What caught my eye was free shuttle service to and from the airport starting at 5 am. When I arrived, the staff seemed a bit apathetic, not too friendly nor accomodating. The doors are manual and I had some heavy bags. I struggled to open them while the front desk staff watched me. I checked in and was told my room was outside in another building - part of the hotel. So I had to haul my bags up to my room on the 3rd floor. While heading to the next building, I couldn't help but notice the very pretty swimming pool surrounded by exquisite plants: huge towering palm trees, banana trees, flowers of many sorts....the walk to the next building is surrounded by all sorts of tropical trees and flowers. It smelled amazing! Sadly, I arrived during the coldest day in 3 years (literally) so the time I spent in Miami was bundled up in a jacket trying to keep warm from the wind. I was unable to enjoy the pool or plants as much as I would have liked. There is no restaraunt or room service in the hotel. It is near large freeways so it is extremely difficult to walk anywhere other than to adjacent hotels along the strip. There is one restaraunt located next door, sort of like an Irish-type pub featuring similar grub and drinks. I had a meal there which was pretty good but later I got peckish and there was no where to buy even an apple or some healthy snacks. A bit disappointing. Coffee/cappucino machines are located in the lobby and one is able to help themselves to free hot beverages. However 9 out of 10 times the beverage I selected was unavailable! The juice machine too was not operating. My room was slightly disappointing as well. I requested a non-smoking room but upon entering my room, the first thing I encountered was a stale smell of cigarette smoke. The room was very, very musty It turned me off immediately. I was unable to open the window, which was large and nice. I had a papaya tree growing right below my window and being from Canada, I welcomed such a tropical sight! The room was average: somewhat clean, the bed was very comfortable and I had more than enough space. When I say 'somewhat clean' I must add that parts of the floor had recently been shampooed (ie. *right* next to the bed) and were wet! The bottoms of my socks were soaking when I accidently walked over the shampooed patches. I could only concluded that considering New Year's Eve was the night before and the room was used prior to me.....well, I will leave it up to the reader to make their own conclusions. The washroom was small but clean and pretty. There was an alarm clock provided in my room which was great. I had to be up very early the next day and it was helpful. This hotel offers free shuttle service to and from the airport which I used the next morning. The driver of the shuttle was most helpful with my luggage and ensured I got right to the appropriate entrance needed for my flight (the airport in Miami is gigantic - like its own little community). Would I stay at this hotel again? Perhaps. As long as the room was more fresh and clean.

First problem was that arriving by car we found it difficult to find the entrance to the hotel and ended up making circles around the place, until we decided to return the rented car first and then catch the shuttle to the hotel. Finally arriving to the hotel they did not have our reservation. I had made it and paid it through travel agency two weeks prior the arrival. The two receptionists talked spanish with each other so it was difficult to follow, but it seemed to me that they just made a new reservation, luckily fot us they had rooms available! The room itself was OK for the price, but nothing to tell to your grandchildren about... We took the shuttle to the airport at 6 o\u00c2\u00b4clock in the morning and that worked properly. Probably wouldn`t stay there again, but it was tolerable.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Red Roof Inn Miami Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d85005-Reviews-Red_Roof_Inn_Miami_Airport-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$90 - $137*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3401 NW Lejeune Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33142-5628</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "85005", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/41/59/99/inn-exterior.jpg"}}

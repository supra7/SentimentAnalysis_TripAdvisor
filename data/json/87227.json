Except for the master bedroom smelling mildewy and water stains on the curtains, the villa fit our needs well. It was roomy, well appointed, nicely updated and the view was great. It would have been the perfect trip had any of the resort amenities promised on the website when we booked in September been what was really provided when we checked in in March. When we booked in September, the resort amenities included daily housekeeping, resort wide charging privileges, and access to the Ritz pool. I knew the access to the Ritz pool was no longer available (thanks, TA!) but the housekeeping and charging privileges had also been removed. While I understand that any establishment is free to change arrangements and it said as much on the website, a note in my check in folio informing me that what I was expecting is no longer available is a deceitful way of running a business, and borders on bait and switch. At no point was ANY of this information communicated to me prior to my arrival. I purposely booked directly through Kapalua Villas rather than VRBO or another booking agency so that I could have the comfort of knowing my interests were represented by the villas and that I would have resort privileges. My phone calls to management went unreturned. We had a great trip and the staff were otherwise very friendly, but I have certain expectations of courtesy when I spend this much money on a trip, and the Kapalua Villas management fell so far below those expectations that I won't return.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDOWN Down down\u201d", "Author": "Will P", "ReviewID": "UR126227169", "Content": "With this recent visit being our fourth, I must state that this will be our last.

That didn't please me, but I drove to it and took a look anyway. It was a ground floor 2nd tier condo, it didn't even overlook the fairway, although you could kind of see the fairway through the roofs and trees. You could tell you were in Hawaii because you could spy the ocean through those same roofs and trees. I drove back down to the rental office, and was told that, nope, there were only TWO of the two bedroom categories in the Ridge, and both were rented, I couldn't switch to anything at all, not even a better view of the golf course. The master bedroom window overlooked the little stairway alcove into the condo; even when the blinds were wide open, it was too dark in that room to see anything. The only lights were bedside lamps. The 2nd bedroom did have a lanai, so it was much brighter in there. We are accustomed to the Ridge, and have stayed in the Bay, and wouldn't have probably minded this condo either, except the view was NOT AS ADVERTISED OR EXPECTED.

We have been to several all inclusives. We were in Maui for a wedding so it was the main reason for picking this vacation.We had a gold villa one bedroom suite, which was beautiful at the kapalua golf villas. This is a very rainy part of maui, yes you can drive 10 min down the road and the sun is shining It rained three out of seven days which did not impress us. It is dark in Maui until 7:30 am so dont think you are going to get up to start enjoying the sunshine The hottest it ever got to was about 82 f by 1:00 pm and then it is dark by 6:00 pm. It is very expensive there. You will need a vehicle as the resort shuttle wouldn't even take us to a luau which was off the property. The shuttles do not leave the property. From the start of check-in at this resort we new we were just another person. The customer service was horrible. Here's your map, this is your room number and give us your credit card for the resort fee. This included such a great deal she said your parking, wifi and access to the spa. No services at the spa just access to the spa. We tried to ask a couple question and were told it is in your package. So after 20 min of driving around trying to follow the map that we were not to ask questions about we gave up and found a shuttle driver sleeping in his van. Could have been his break time so we asked him instead of him saying follow me i will show you he says oh where is your map. We never did get wifi to work on our ipad. The 1-800 number in the room is only for the connection they could not help with wireless. We also had tella marketers calling us in the evenings. We went to the front desk a couple days later to get some help again trying to find our beach and the other pools and chatted with Samantha a very nice lady, who advised us the manager would be calling us to apologize and fix things. He never did. I guess I thought perhaps he could've comped the resort fee at least upon check out . So I would say this place really doesn't make you feel like a guest. You will not get cleaning service everyday. The kitchen had every appliance you could think of if you are going on vacation to cook. It is very quiet if you want to come some place to relax. You will need to drive to the beach or take the shuttle. At the end of February you will apparently no longer have access to the Ritz Carlton pools so if you are a pool person this will not be the place for you. The pineapple grill gave great service may be a bit pricey. Very beautiful golf courses with a price tag. Oh and don't go to the Rc residences.. This should've been pointed out on the map as you will very kindly be asked to leave.

We stayed in ridge villa 2623 and it was clean, updated, nice furniture and very large lanai. It's an open concept loft master bedroom so I don't know if it would be terrific for couples to share a 2 BR, probably better for a family. The staff at the check in were fantastic. The only time we needed help was when the dryer wasn't working and they were at our door within 5 minutes to fix it. The spa was beautiful and I truly expected it to be only passable. I guess I need to not believe every review. Only concerns I have are that the pools in the villa areas are really small (think a backyard pool) and what will happen when you can't use the Ritz anymore? That might be the only reason we don't return. Otherwise I have nothing but praise for the villa we were in.

When I book a vacation rental, I'd rather than play this game of creative writing. That (by far) is my biggest complaint - if you're going to misrepresent the property to me, then we're already off to a bad start. This seems to be a common theme echoed by past reviewers - there is sometimes a huge difference between villas supposedly in the same category. Here are some other positives and negatives... Positives: (1) great location - we've stayed in the Kapalua area before and we love the fact that the area is bit removed from Maui's \"hotel zones\"; Kapalua Bay also has, in our opinion, one of the best family beaches in Maui since the beach sits inside a protected bay (the beach is within stroller/walking distance from the villas); (2) kitchen/laundry - our unit had a full kitchen as well as washer/dryer units and since we were traveling with 2 toddlers, this was a major convenience; (3) Ritz-Carlton access and proximity - villa guests have access to the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua's pools and facilities (HOWEVER, access to the Ritz-Carlton pools ends after February 18, 2012 and access does not include the Ritz-Carlton Residences pool, a fact I was rudely informed of when I asked about it - \"Sir, that is private property !!\" (Like I'm an idiot for not already knowing the answer to my own question. See my spotty service comment below.) Negatives: (1) spotty service - when we checked in, we were given maps, informational booklets (advertising), resort IDs, etc., what we weren't given were the keys to our villa (a fact we failed to note until we drove all the way to our villa a couple of miles from the villa check-in offices - shame on us for not checking but we assumed the keys would be a part of the \"orientation\" packet) - also, after a few requests/queries to the front desk, we basically stopped asking for anything since the answer was usually \"no\" (or totally unhelpful); (2) our unit was a bit dilapidated - water stains above the kitchen/living room area, leftover paint cans in the closet, loose screws lying by the windows; (3) noise - our unit was the lower unit and we could hear every footstep of the guests in the unit above us.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "De Smet, South Dakota", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice!\u201d", "Author": "DeSmetguy", "ReviewID": "UR123891221", "Content": "We stayed in a 2 bedroom Gold Golf Villa, 12P6 for a week.

A word about Kapalua: yes, you can expect a little more rain and a little more rain in northwest Maui, but the natural beauty of the place more than offsets the slightly different weather. One of the many reasons that we like Kapalua is the shuttle. You could literally arrive at the property, park your car, and never use it again for the next six or seven days. A simple phone call results in an air-conditioned minibus arriving in ten minutes or less, to take you to any restaurant, golf course or store within Kapalua. Although we didn't use the free telephone service, that is a big plus. We did use the free wi fi, which worked perfectly. In my opinion, these amenities make the $25 per day resort fee well worth it.

The new unit could not have been considered gold level (Ridge 2212), well maybe back in 1982. It had loud and ineffective window A/C units, dirty plywood kitchen cabinets veneered with melamine, torn window shades which did little to block light, and horrible mattresses.

To some this may not seem like a big deal, but it made you feel like second class citizen when there. All the restaurants on the Kapalua compound were excellent, but it was nice to have the option to cook in your villa and not get bloated on resort food. We decided to check out early and stay at the Four Seasons for the remainder of our stay to maybe plan a future trip there and to catch up on sleep because of the horrible mattresses. Upon checkout the front desk did not ask us how our stay was or why we were checking out early. I guess they learned not to ask a question they do not want to know the answer to. Kapalua is very beautiful and not a crowded as some other resort areas such as Kaanapali or Wailea, but it is windier, cloudier, rainier, and cooler than the other resort areas. The golf was good but I would recommend the Plantation course over the Bay course. It is only $20 more and has great views and much better condition. The greens are very difficult however. I guess I'll check back and see what the Outrigger reply will be.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Stay\u201d", "Author": "dogwalker27", "ReviewID": "UR123175422", "Content": "Stayed at the Kapalua Villas in January 2012 for 6 nights.

We typically visit Maui about once per year, and generally we stay at the Grand Wailea or the Hoolei Villas at the Grand Wailea. We booked an ocean view gold 2 bedroom villa for $739 per night plus resort fee and taxes, which seemed like a great rate for the Christmas break. First the positives: The Ridge Gold Villa we ended up in (more on that later) was a beautiful, recently remodeled unit with a granite kitchen, new furniture, and marble bathrooms. At about 1800 square feet with 2 bedrooms and 3 full bathrooms, there was plenty of room for my wife, 2 teenage kids, and me. Also, the ocean view from the lanai was beautiful. Due to a mixup with our room, we were offered housekeeping daily (instead of every 3rd day), and we appreciated the gesture by the management. Staying at the Villas, you get access to the Ritz Carlton pool (where the service is impeccable), and this pool is only about a 10 minute walk. You also get access to the Kapalua Spa, about a 10 minute walk also, that had a great fitness center, some yoga and fitness classes, a beautiful pool, and great massages. There are a number of good restaurants throughout the Kapalua resort, and there is a complementary shuttle to get around the resort - just call a few minutes ahead. Kapalua is about 10 minutes north of Kaanapali and 20 minutes north of Lahaina, so there is plenty to do near the resort. Yet what is nice about Kapalua is that it never feels crowded. However, Kapalua is a few degrees cooler and a bit windier than Kaanapali or Wailea, and it does rain more, but the weather was fine during our stay (although we understand there was a lot of rain the week before our trip. While overall we had a great stay, there were a few negatives: First, when we checked in, they initially put us in a standard villa (not a Gold Villa), and the place was a dump. It was straight out of the late 70's or early 80's, it was filthy, and it smelled. The front desk tried to tell us this was a Gold Villa, but after insisting we be moved or we would check out, she moved us. She kept insisting this first villa was Gold, but the housekeeping manager later admitted it was a standard villa. We would have never stayed in anything like that first unit. The entire ordeal wasted a little over 2 hours, and definitely got our stay off to a bad start. Second, the service is not up to a 4 or 5 star caliber. The staff are poorly trained. We called asking for down pillows (the foam pillows on our beds were in very bad shape), and they brought more foam pillows. Then when we called again asking for down pillows, the front desk didn't know if they had them. It took determination and insistence, and demonstrating some frustration, to finally get someone to bring some down pillows. The same happened with Internet access. A simple question about which wireless network to join was met with complete puzzlement, so we just figured it out on our own. After these incidents, the housekeeping manager offered us daily housekeeping and her apologies. She was the one person who understood customer service, and she made up for the shortcomings of the rest of the staff. The general manager also left a message apologizing for the issues a few days later, which was appreciated. Our only other complaint will probably keep us from coming back. The bed was unbelievably uncomfortable. The very thin mattress is clearly past its prime. Our backs were killing us, and we don't have any back problems. We will probably try Kapalua again, but stay at either the Ritz timeshare or at the hotel.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Location": "5", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cThe Ridge\u201d", "Author": "Jayhawk68", "ReviewID": "UR121994879", "Content": "We stayed in a 1 BR, 2BA Condo (#621) at the Ridge and could not have been happier.

The location is outstanding - beach, ocean views, sunsets, golf and sun. We had rented a one bedroom Ridge villa overlooking the Bay villas and Ritz Carleton residences and the ocean. The location on the ridge gave us spectacular views of some of the resort grounds and the ocean from the lanai and one of the golf course fairways from the front side. We watched whales breaching in the channel between Maui and Molakai, incredible sunsets each night, and the most intense rainbows we can remember seeing. The one bedroom unit we rented was large, well equipped, very comfortable and furnished appropriately. Everything worked and worked well. One minor problem was resolved quickly and cheerfully by the resort maintenance staff. The restaurants on site were easily reachable by resort shuttle (a great perk). The dining experience at Merrimans Kapalua is world class, with tremendous views of Kapalua beach and the ocean and the cusine easily matched the views.We also visited Sansei at Kapalua for sushi and the Pineapple Grill. The food and dining experience at both was wonderful. We golfed the Bay course one day and while expensive its views and quality easily paid back the cost. The golf staff were professional and polite to work with. The area around the resort, and nothing is too far away in Maui, if you have a car, is excellent for exploring.

The bay was not too far from our room - we stayed in the Bay Villas, so were able to take the path along the shore - maybe a 10 minute walk. The condo room itself was much better than I could have expected. We stayed in a Gold 2 bedroom villa with an ocean view. The place was huge - there were actually 3 full bathrooms - and the kitchen, living room, and dining room were more than adequate space for my husband and me and another couple. The only disadvantage was that the second bedroom was a loft - so it was open to the first floor which gave less privacy. We were only there for 3 nights, so it was not really an issue, but it would probably work better with kids as opposed to another couple.

While a Pack n' Play is fine, for the size of my daughter now, we really need a crib (as they mentioned on the website). Apparently, now to get a crib we have to pay an addtional amount over the quoted amount on their website. When we questioned the discrepancy the woman that was helping us basically said we had to pay it as the website stated a Pack'N Play......which, oh by the way, it doesn't.

The maid service was okay, news paper delivery inconsistent and no turn down service. Second time booked same thing - stayed in Bay Villas again but this unit was a bit beat up. The finishes were not as good, and little things were broken like the shades and some fixtures. No tub again, maid service a bit worse, but there was turn down service and it was consistent. This past summer was the 3rd and we booked the same. But this time we were put in the Ridge Villas. The finishes in this unit were better than 2nd equal to 1st. But it was much further away from the ocean. Also lousy view from the bedroom. You are basically looking at the parking. The previous 2 stays you had a view of the ocean from the bedroom - unit was a 2 level plan this one was a single level unit. When my wife went to see if we could switch there was a blond woman there that told her that another woman was complaining and she basically told her if you don't like it you don't have to stay there ... wow - so my wife kind of wimped out and we stayed at the Ride. Also you are only allowed to go the the pools in your area. Which is a shame. Our pool was great for location. but it did not have a view of the ocean like our 2 previouys stays. The maid service was horrible (they changed their policy and only change bedding every 3rd day or something so basically we were making our beds - i understand recycling the sheets but make the bed), newspaper delivery was spotty, and they had no turn down service, also no slippers or robes - had to ask. And the kitchen had ants ... lots of them everywhere. we kept everything in the refrigerator. Something happened to their service. in addition to the nightly rate you pay a $25 per day resort fee.

We stayed on Maui at The Kapalua \"Golf\" Villas from October 1st through October 15th, 2011 and absolutely loved everything about it. When it's your first time visiting a new place it can be scary and confusing trying to decide where to stay. After all, if you are anything like us you have planned and saved for a long time to be able to take a vacation such as this not to mention that you are using your vacation time from work. After reading reviews like this one for a lot of places on Maui, I decided on The Kapalua Villas and booked our trip through Orbitz. For months I wondered if I had made the right choice. After spending two wonderful weeks in Paradise, I can honestly say that I made the perfect choice and hope to one day be able to stay there again. We don't play golf but were in Building 12 of the Golf Villas and had a partial ocean view. Our Villa was tastefully decorated with quality furniture and appliances, very clean and comfortable and had an awesome view. The grounds are unbelievably manicured!! Many villas are much closer to the beach access than ours was so if that is important to you, I would suggest you call them and ask what those are called. I actually love to walk so didn't mind the 8-10 minute stroll down. Speaking of walking....there is a coastal trail which begins at the Kapalua Bay beach that you must check out. There was a pool right beside of our villa that had a shelter, tables and bbq grills so you could cook out by the pool if you wanted. By being a guest at the villas you also have access to the neighboring Ritz Carlton pool, hot tub, beach, restaurants and more. The Kapalua villas are located on the west side of Maui along with (in my opinion) some of the best scenery, places to snorkel, walk, bike and eat. The Plantation House is just down the road and serves breakfast until 3pm and has awesome views. There is this little country store called The Honolua Store on the property that we fell in love with and visited daily for pastries, very good inexpensive hot and cold food, coffee, tea, chocolate and souvenirs. This is getting really long so I will try to wrap it up...If you like the outdoors and want a peaceful, relaxing but memorable vacation I think that this is the place for you. We paid a $25 per day resort fee which I was a little hesitant about at first but with all of the amenities, daily housekeeping, internet and so much more, it was worth every penny. The Kaplula Villas along with the people of Maui went above and beyond to make our vacation an exceptional one.

The grounds of the resort are in great shape, the numerous beaches (the big ones and the hidden gems) are some of the best in the entire world, and the wealth of activities all make for a perfect getaway with friends and family. There were eight of us on this trip and we had a total of three units, all gold (well worth the few extra dollars). The rooms were large, clean, and fully loaded, thought we did not stay inside all that much we were comfortable when we did. Spa, you must use the spa! Get a massage after working out in the best \"hotel\" gym we have seen (very modern equipment). Housekeeping was daily and we appreciated the care that was evident in cleaning up after our kids ( the adults too I suppose). The check in was warm and very informative and the concierge set us up with a full agenda in which everyone got to enjoy what they liked most. The golf courses are fantastic and never seemd crowded, similar to the resort overall. We are bringing more people next year and definitely staying at the villas. Staff that stood out include Sam, Tatzuko, Rexy, Editha, and the desk manager (sorry, didn't get his name).", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful villas, not the best location\u201d", "Author": "Rachel Y", "ReviewID": "UR119254099", "Content": "The actual villas were gorgeous, we had an ocean view which was quite spectacular and the villa itself was massive with all the up to date appliances etc. The resort as a whole had good restaurants and beaches and there is a free shuttle that can take you round so you can save your petrol.

Perched on a bluff overlooking the Pacific and with a stunning view of Molokai, there is no lovelier place on the planet. Here, serenity takes hold and never lets go. This our second visit to the villas this year and both experiences have been above expectations. We stayed in an oceanfront one bedroom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd villa (23-G2). The great advantage to these villas is the plethora of space. Furnishings were very nice and the unit was in very good shape. Only a few cosmetic changes are needed. It has granite countertops in the bathroom with two sinks and plenty of vanity space and a large shower. The kitchen has stainless steel appliances and granite, too. Bedroom is approx. 12x12 with a very comfortable king bed. The internet connection was speedy and there are televisions in the living room and bedroom and both have DVD players. The only downside is their size. The living room TV is a 26\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards is small. Unfortunately, it is built in to a cabinet and the owner may not want to change it out. The bedroom TV is small, too. Both of our stays were in gold units. There were some units for sale that we viewed that were not updated to gold. I would not recommend these as some of the furnishings were rather tattered and the kitchen counters and appliances were not updated. I believe the best units are from buildings 19 to 23. They front the ocean and have the best views You can rent these units on the Ritz-Carlton and Outrigger sites. Additionally, some are rented by the owners on VRBO and flipkey. The resort has great restaurants and golf courses. I recommend Merriman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for dinner and the Plantation course for golf (I have done separate reviews for these.) The Pineapple grill is also great as is the Plantation house on the golf course. Kapalua is the premier resort on Maui if you are looking for a serene setting. However, if you are looking for a lot of action, you might be better off in Kaanapali. If you are looking for a Disneyland-esque experience you may prefer the ostentatious Grand Wailea and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equally inflated prices.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plantation Florida", "Title": "\u201cFancy - If you have the money\u201d", "Author": "robvia", "ReviewID": "UR119002849", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights in room 522, Ridge Villa.

The cons: Master bed was starting to sag in the spots where people sleep. They need a new mattress. What they really need is the new 7k Tempur-pedic beds. Also, the shower head was moldy, handle cover off, and there was some rust under the shower bar. The entire shower fixture needs to be replaced and the tub re-chalked. The carpet in the master bedroom is also starting to wear in the traffic area. There were water ants in the kitchen, need some Tero. Each bedroom has a wall unit for the AC, they work great but make noise. We mentioned all of this to the staff at check out. They listened but didn't make any notes. I'm not sure how they get feedback to the owners of all the problems. Pros: The work out room at The Spa is nice, and you get to use it. They give you a parking pass which lets you park at The Spa, then you can walk down to Kapalua beach. This is a good reason to stay at the villas, along with all the other stuff I mentioned. The cons may have you wondering why you spent so much money, we stayed 2 nights at Eldorado and though it was better. The over all \"feel\" of this area is upscale.

The only drawback, and a minor one at that, is that you have to drive to get groceries, etc., unlike most of the tourists who stay Ka'anapali. Having known this prior to arriving, we shopped at WalMart and Safeway upon our arrival at the airport in Kahului. You can also get a great meal at Da Kitchen in Kahului (not the same as the Ka'anapali franchise) before you get to the villa to settle in. We arrived at around noon at the airport and couldn't check in until 3pm anyway. In short, our villa was a home away from home. Granite countertops, SubZero built in fridge, walk-in open shower in the Master, a view of both Lana'i and Moloka'i to start off with. Parking is right out front, and although we didn't use it, the shuttle is available to take you anywhere on the property. We did have minor issues (really non-issues) with the porch light not working and 2 small cockroaches and, of course, geckos. But you're on an lush island, this is expected. I shooed the locals out and the service people changed the lightbulb with only one request. Towels are changed daily and they semi-clean the rooms. Remember, that this is not a hotel, so the beds are not made daily. I believe it's every other or 3rd day. No big deal. The person who griped about having his phone stolen should have known better to leave expensive personal items out. Passports and the like should be kept in the in-room safe. This villa should not be treated any different than high-end hotel. Things will get stolen. Be smart and use the safe. Best secluded beach to see giant (and I mean GIANT) sea turtles is Honokeana bay. You have to park on Napili Place (no later than 9:30 in the morning), walk down to Napili Bay and walk AROUND Honokeana Cove (head south on the black rocks) to the next bay which is Honokeana Bay. Jump right in and head towards the motel that had large rocks for their beach (really, rocks, not sand at the beach). You'll see the turtles feeding not far from these rocks. Although we didn't get to go, I can tell that Honolua Bay would have been good for snorkeling as well, but the secret's out and you have to get there early because parking is VERY limited. Kapalua Bay is a great one with family for just dipping in the water but you should definitely buy water shoes at Safeway because everyone of us got scraped by the rocks that are not to far from the water's edge. Fleming's Beach (1 mile north of the compound (?)) is great for boogie boarding or body surfing as it doesn't have rocks to get slammed into and there's a lifeguard. Oneloa Bay, which is on the Kapalua property, is also great for boarding or body surfing but the rocks can be troublesome and there's no lifeguard. Rent your snorkelling equipment at Snorkel Bob's just down the road. We only took advantage of the Ritz Carlton Hotel pool a couple of times but really, as beautiful as it was, it's still just a pool. You're in Maui to enjoy the beaches and that's what we did. But if you have little ones, they might enjoy movie night at the pool (Toy Story 3 was playing when we were there). One thing we wondered about is why these people would pay more money to stay in a hotel room (granted it's the Ritz) and not one of the Villas on the same property? But then again, we'd love to keep Kapalua Villas our little secret. Our daily routine is that we usually purchased breakfast and some souvenirs at the Honolua General store (now being run by ABC stores) and the food and prices were definitely reasonable. We really didn't have time to have a sit-down breakfast because of the activities that we crammed in (ziplining, crater excursions, side trips, etc), requiring early arrivals. In Lahaina, eat at the Cheeseburger restaurant and have mango shave (I learned it's not SHAVED, but SHAVE) ice at Ululani down the street. You can't go wrong there! Hula Grill at Ka-anapali had great food as well. I had the Wasabi Rib Eye steak there. The Aloha Mixed Plate restaurant (I believe it's behind the Safeway) had OK food, but they ran out of Kalbi and we waited 1 hour to be seated and another hour to be served.

I called the numbers they called and some were phone calls to house keeping at the villas. After discovering this new information I called the villas and spoke with Anthony [--], the resort manager. He blew me off saying I was not being fair to his staff and I had no proof. He went so far as to tell me I was rude and it was my problem not his. This changed my outlook on the villas.

We had a 1 bedroom oceanfront villa with a lovely balcony that overlooked a small, grassy lawn and the rocky shore. Kapalua is a wee bit out of the way, so you will need a rental car, for sure. I must admit, though, that this location can't be beat if your goal is relaxation, and peace and quiet. The unit we had (36B4) was 1200 square feet; the size of a decent 1 bedroom apartment. It had a fully appointed kitchen and a stackable Bosch washer and dryer. When I'm on vacation, I hate having to forage for breakfast in the morning, and after a week in Honolulu, it was nice to be able to do some laundry. As well, we had access to the Ritz Carlton (with room charge privileges) next door and the Kapalua Spa. Unfortunately, the Spa does not allow you to charge to your villa, but that was no big deal. The Spa is great, and the people are really nice, so having access to it is fantastic. I've stayed at the Ritz in Kapalua before, and while it is heavenly, I think I now prefer the space, and the peace and quiet of the villas more. Our group rented 3 villas that week, and all were very different. Our villa was beautifully appointed with nice built-ins, tasteful art on the walls and interesting little pieces of furniture and curios that made the place feel warm and welcoming, just like home! There was a knock at the door each morning to change and/or replace towels as necessary, and every third day someone did a more thorough cleaning. Since I am not that messy a person, this was quite fine. Perhaps if you had a bunch of kids running around creating havoc, you might want to see a more frequent service, but it was all good.

There were six of us total that shared the villa for the week: my husband and myself, his parents, and his sister and her husband. We were so excited to share this trip with them because we had been to Maui for our honeymoon 5 years ago and knew we would return with family. After a long day of traveling we got to the office to check in, and they had no record of our reservation for a 3 bedroom, 3 bath Gold villa. We had booked it through a travel agent and had all our confirmation paperwork, and the front desk staff didn't seem to believe that we had reservations. Just 3 weeks before that, I had called Outrigger's general phone number to confirm our reservation, and it was there. The nice man I spoke with on the phone repeated all our reservation info back to me with our names, the type of villa, and the dates. It was all there. But when we checked in, it was all gone, and there was no Gold villa for us to stay in. They only had a fairway view villa with 2 bathrooms. After over and hour of waiting and talking to our travel agent, we took the only thing they had. They said they would not charge our debit card again, but there is still a very large hold on it that hasn't cleared, and we checked out 3 days ago. Our travel agent worked very hard to figure out our refund because we had paid for and reserved the best, and actually stayed in a much less expensive villa. But it took Outrigger almost the full week to figure out it was their fault and what our refund was. I must say I am disappointed with how this was handled, and had hoped we would hear an apology from the manager or at least get a call from the staff making sure we were satisfied with our stay. But we did not. On a brighter note, the villa worked out ok for the 6 of us. We had so much fun snorkeling in Kapalua Bay, and Honolua Bay and exploring the island that we really didn't spend much time at the villa. Even though the villa was fairway view, it still had a stunning view of the ocean and property. The Kapalua Spa is a beautiful place, and a must see if staying at Kapalua Villas.

This was our first time in Hawaii, and we split the stay between here and Honolulu. We absolutely loved everything about the Kapalua Villas from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The property is very large, with amazing views of the mountains and ocean from all over. Check-in was quick and easy. There is the Honolua Store on property, which is a small grocery store among other things. We stopped here first thing and bought some groceries. It was a little pricey. Our villa was amazing. This is what made the trip so great. We stayed in a Gold Ocean View villa. I would highly recommend staying in a Gold Villas, as everything was immaculate, and from reading reviews before our trip, it seems to me that anyone who was disappointed with their villa was not in a gold unit. I also enjoyed the ocean view, and debated between booking an ocean view or ocean front. I was happy we went with the ocean view because we had a panoramic view whereas it appeared if you were in an ocean front villa, you would have only a view of the ocean rather than of the ocean and mountains as we did, plus the ocean front villas are not by any of the nice beaches anyway. Kapalua Bay was by far the best beach. Great snorkeling, clam water, beautiful, and there is a beach stand where you can rent chairs, etc. I enjoyed renting a lounge chair rather than laying on a towel on the beach as it can be windy here and otherwise sand is blowing on you & your things. D.T. Flemming beach was nice, but way to windy the day we were there. We really enjoyed our villa as we were able to cook, do laundry, etc. This might not seem like things you want to do on vacation, but we liked being able to do these things as it seemed more like we were living there not just visiting. Our villa had a large, well equipped kitchen with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, a nice dinning area, living room, huge bedroom with King bed, and two bathrooms, both with very nice stand up showers. We had a small balcony off our bedroom, and a HUGE balcony off the living room with sliding glass doors, a table, four chairs, and a lounge chair. We also had our own covered parking spot and our own entrance which was very nice. The small pools around the villas were quiet and nice, with grills, bathrooms, etc. available. We spent some time at the Ritz Carlton pool as well, which was very nice and we enjoyed being able to use their amenities as well. We especially liked the poolside service offered, and the comfy lounge chairs and nice towels there. We dined at Pineapple Grill, which was just ok IMO, as well as the restaurant on D.T. Flemming beach(I believed called the Beach House), for lunch which was nice with a great view. We had breakfast at The Plantation House which I would highly recommend. It was delicious with good service and amazing views. My husband played golf at the Bay Course and could not stop talking about how amazing it was, while I went to the Kapalua Spa for a massage which was equally amazing. We also used the facilities at the Spa on another day, which are included with your resort fee, and are very nice, especially the infinity edge pool. We took the short drive to Honolua Bay which also offered excellent snorkeling, and went down to Lahania one night for the Old Lahania Luau, which is highly recommended. Other than that we stayed on the resort, and you never really need to leave, it offers so much. We did however really enjoy having a rental car. There is a resort shuttle available, and we did see it operating frequently, but found it much more convenient to be able to hop in our car whenever we pleased. Parking was fairly easy and free around the resort. Our only disappointment was that our zipline tour we had scheduled with Kapalua Adventures was cancelled due to high winds, (and the day we were set to go out was the least windy of all the days we were there) so this is something to be aware of. It is pretty windy on this part of the island. We also were not aware of the fact that this had been cancelled until we got there. They called us in the morning but we had a missed call, but they didn't leave us a message which I don't understand why, and we could have scheduled something else had we known. The concierge was nice and helped us book a last minute sunset cruise, which was enjoyable, but I would have much rather done the zip lining. We also ate appetizers and had drinks at the Aloha Lounge which had great sushi & saki, as well as a great view of the Ritz pool (another plus of this pool it is open 24 hours). Overall we loved our stay here and would gladly return. We are jealous of the people who own property there, it is very beautiful and highly recommended for a stay both with family or for a honeymoon couple, we loved the secludedness of it!", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cThe Kapalua Villas were amazing!\u201d", "Author": "t0winsto", "ReviewID": "UR114861288", "Content": "We had never stayed here and booked based off the reviews.

We rented a car from enterprise as the drive from the main airport is about an hour. The drive is beautiful, when we were picking up our rental car our bus driver mentioned beach 14 (named beach 14 because it is opposite the mile 14 mark on route 30), as a good spot to go to as it is very calm to swim in the sea and the reef is nearby to look at any sealife. We unfortunately did not have time to do this, but I thought it may be helpful. When we got to Kapalua Resort the sign posts are unclear and we ended up going up and down the main road a few times before we saw the sign for the office. We checked in with a lady who was busy rushing through telling us everything at a million miles per hour, and did not want to listen to any questions we had. I asked if we had an ocean view room and she snapped of course. We asked if my handwritten hotel pass could be put in my married name. I was told that we had booked it over six months ago in my maiden name, so \"tough luck\" it would be in my maiden name. This I felt was rude, in every hotel we had gone to, the check in staff had at least congratulated us on getting married. She did not care that we were on our honeymoon and made no effort to welcome us. The couple next to us who were checking in at the same time were getting a much warmer reception and that was because they had previously been on the treetop trial. Our travel agent had rung every hotel we were going to, to remind them we were on our honeymoon, this message had either been ignored or they felt in was beneath them to acknowledge this. We got a better reception at the Honolua Store After the check-in staff had made me cry we then went to our villa, we were staying on the ridge. Our Villa was fantastic, we had an amazing view, really spacious villa, de-core was a little dated but this may be due to the people that own the villa rather than the actual resort. The maids come daily, sometimes they bring you new coffee and sometimes they don't. It was hard to determine what time they would come, being on our honeymoon we did not appreciate the two mornings they came at 9am. We tried locking the door and they would ring the bell constantly until you answered. There was no privacy door sign as stated in the handbook. In the handbook it also states that there are computers to use in the Kapalua Resort by concierge, this is part of your room surcharge ( as was the daily coffee), when we asked at reception they said they no longer had the computers and that we could use the Ritz Carlton Business Centre. So we popped down to the Ritz Cartton to use there facilities, as it was out of business hours there was no one to ask. They asked for a pin or you could pay by credit card. As we were being charged for internet access on daily basis we assumed we must have free internet access there, so up to reception we went. Kapalua Resort reception asked if there was a code we needed for the computer, we were told we had to pay. At this point my husband got a little angry as in the handbook and their website is clearly states guests have access to the internet in their villas and at the resort office. The staff member we spoke to said they were fully aware that it still stated this and that yes they should change this. They did offer any e-mails that we needed could be sent to them but we would need to forward them, when asked how exactly we would forward e-mails on to them they replied log on your e-mail account. The wifi in our villa could not be accessed by our i phone, not even when we turned it on and off again. On a positive note towels and sun beds on the beach were a good touch and the guy that ran the beach hut recognized us after day one. For my husbands birthday we went to Merrimans, we used the shuttle, no problems there. The restaurant was fantastic, the service was amazing and the food was melt in the mouth. No need to dress up, but do book as it was rammed when we went. We charged our meal to our room. When check out occurred we checked the charges, noticed the meal was missing we mentioned this to the lady, obviously not listening told us to sign it and then disappeared. We have since had an e-mail from the hotel telling us off and they have charge it to us.

We had already stayed in Wailea, and had no desire to stay in Ka'anapali, so we chose Kapalua for our visit. We chose the Kapalua Villas because we liked the idea of having some meals in the room while still having access to a luxury hotel (Ritz-Carlton) if that is what we desired. I booked our unit by directly calling the Kapalua Villas. I made the reservation in December 2010 and got what I consider a good rate - $349/night plus taxes and resort fee, which ups the total to $417/night. Checking in - The Kapalua Villas office is located not too far inside the entrance to the Kapalua resort area. The check-in was very fast, the service was very friendly, and we were allowed to check-in even though it was at least two hours prior to check-in time. You are given a nice map of the resort and I recommend picking up a resort trail map when you check-in, too. A small brochure is provided upon which is your villa number and the phone number of the room. The privileges associated with staying in the villas is also described in detail. The $25 resort fee includes the following per the brochure (with my comments): - 24-hour front desk (always available and always friendly) - in-room safe - in-room coffee - self-parking (very close to our front door) - airline boarding pass print kiosk (this no longer exists but they have one you can use at the Ritz) - incoming faxes - high-speed/wireless internet - unlimited local & long-distance calls and calls to ~40 countries (there are several phones in the villa) - day use of Kapalua spa/fitness (i used it every morning; the gym is very nice) - preferred tee times (I don't golf) - preferred golf rates (ditto) - use of 18-hole putting course (fun but not in the best condition; grass could use some work) - use of Ritz-Carlton pool and towels - towels and chairs at Kapalua Bay & DT Fleming beaches (this service does not exist at DT Fleming) - use of the Kapalua tennis garden (we played every day; very nice staff) - charging privileges throughout the resort (very convenient) - on-call shuttle from 6am - 11pm (never used it but saw the shuttle all over the place) - pineapple in the room on check-in (very sweet) - Wall Street Journal (you can get the Honolulu paper at the Ritz) - robes & slippers - turn-down service (they no longer do this) Despite the fact that they need to update the brochure I felt the value was there for these services, although I would prefer if they just raised the room rate by $25/night and included this as a resort amenity. Grounds - Absolutely beautiful; we were extremely happy as we drive to the Bay VIllas, and then drove through the complex. The resort is extremely well-kept as is the Bay Villas complex. We saw landscapers and maintenance personnel all over the place. There are several nice pools in the Bay VIllas and each has a BBQ. I cooked steaks one night and would have liked to see the BBQ work better - these people are paying at least $1,000 a month in HOA fees so they should get BBQs that are in top working order. We had to call maintenance about the one at the pool nearest to us. View - Why come all the way to Hawaii not be oceanfront? The rock formations and beaches fronting our villa were amazing. From our patio it was about a 15 foot walk to the bluff, and then a quick trail down the bluff to some great tidcepools and crashingn waves (though not really good for swimming). A very short walk (2 minutes?) took you to Oneloa Bay, which was super nice to relax and play in the waves. A five minute walk in the other direction took you to Kapalua Bay, which was very nice, more crowded, and had some good snorkeling. Sitting on the patio (we deliberately chose the downstairs unit so we could have a nice open patio) afforded us amazing whale watching - it was like watching the Discovery channel every day. Villa - This is a 'Gold' villa, which means it was remodeled to very high standards. The decor is nice and modern, and fits well with the surroundings. There is one bedroom (nicely furnished) with a king bed (very comfortable), one bathroom (closet is in the bathroom), laundry closet, large living room, small dining area, and fully remodeled kitchen. There are lots of windows, and we kept things wide open all the time to enjoy the view and the breeze. Kitchen - The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, cutlery, dishes, glasses, etc. There is a good dishwasher, very nice cooktop, microwave, refrigerator, etc. We basicall ate breakfast and a very light lunch in the unit every day, and dinner a few nights. We found that we most enjoyed eating on the patio and when we come back we will eat most of our dinners in the unit. Bathroom - Good size with a great shower. The toilet area is separated from the bathroom, and there are two sinks. The bathroom amenities provided at the resort were very good. My wife is usually very critical of lotion provided at a resort but she said this stuff was very good. Cleaning service - We thought this was just OK ... we had to call a couple of times to get towels refreshed and bathroom amenities replaced. The timing of the cleaning varied from one day to the next. I would have liked to see more attention paid to cleaning the wood floors. Per the owner's instructions (and we do this anyway) we kept our shoes off while inside. After a few hours our feet were very dirty. Dining - Pineapple Grill is excellent! Merriman's might just have the best restaurant location in the world. The Honolua general store has good food and great prices. Bottom line - Why would anyone stay at the Ritz when you can stay here?

I am not sure where everyone was from who complained about those things, but I am from Wisconsin and 83 degrees everyday with a little rain and wind is a phenomenal break from what we're used to! Also read mixed reviews about the rooms. My suggestion there would be to make sure you get a \"gold\" room. Ours was beautiful and well kept up. We stayed in the golf villas and had a great view of the ocean. Many of the great beaches (Napili for swimming, Kapalua for snorkeling.) were in walking distance and the walking paths are right there too. Snorkel Bob's close by as well. Due to the fact we went during busy season, my only complaint is you have to book activities way in advance and one does not always know what they want to do until you arrive in Maui. We didn't get to go zipining at Kapalua due to that fact and the kids couldn't get into the activity they wanted at theCousteau center. Kapalua is a bit out of the way, but if you want to have a great trip away from the hustle and bustle this is where I'd stay. Also, for those of you with kids, our 8 and 12 year old were just fine without a resort that had an activity center for kids. They would have been happy to spend most of their time on the beach, pool, or on the walking paths. One last thing, if you stay here for the kitchen amenities, which was another big draw for us, make sure you get the store card if you shop at Safeway. Saved us over $160.

We most recently stayed in a Ridge Ocean view 1 Br Gold Kapalua Villa and loved it. The view was excellent with white water views, we spent hours just watching whales from our lanai and balcony. The inside was updated with stone and tile, with exceptionally nice bathrooms. The unit was immaculate when we arrived, but we noticed the cleaning crew doesnt return it to that level daily(The Ritz Carlton does for those interested). All the conviences of home are there, its about as good as you can hope for. The Area- Kapalua is the prettiest resort area on the island, with the Villas like a suburb. A shuttle is available for local beaches, Spa, Ritz and restaraunts. Kaanapali'Lahaina is/are an easy drive. Walking trails and the amentities of the ritz as well. The beaches all closeby- Can you ask for more? Kapalua Bay has the best snorkeling Fleming Beach- Big waves Honolua Bay- Seclusion and snorkeling(shuttle does not go there) Ironwoods- tranquil and we could walk to Napili Bay too Outrigger- I have always liked Outrigger, and have stayed at many of their properties in Hawaii. They have always been somewhere from very helpful to minimum fair(they did promise me early checkout then took it back but I forgve them) To answer some previous reviews- Yes, some units are little bit more gold than others. Ours had old screen doors, some poor woodwork and an older couch. We are picky , but it was just minor stuff, mainly it just didnt match all the beautiful updates you see on the website. Every unit Ive seen is at least a 3 star, golds are at least a 4 star Some golds are closer to 5 star, and its up to the indidual owners make that happen", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d", "Author": "streisd", "ReviewID": "UR102687827", "Content": "What`s not to like!

Your stay really depends on the villa that you get, and there are enough reviews reporting back about the wide variety of rooms one might get for the same price/level. The first room my family got had priceless views, but the decor was 20-30 years old, with shag rugs in the bedrooms, and a permeating musty smell. It was a ground floor villa with two bedrooms, and was dank, dark and felt like the basement apartment of a college apartment. The kitchen seemed 20-30 years old as well, and was poorly equipped. Utensils, glasses and all looked years old and really would have been difficult to use, feeling like you were camping at a log cabin on a remote island. Within minutes of arriving in the room on a late night arrival, my son's asthma started acting up which typically gets inflammed with his allergies for dog hair, dust mites, etc. Three of the other four in our party were complaining of respirator issues after the first couple hours and first night. I voiced a complaint with the front desk who indicated that they were fully booked but would look for alternatives. We had to vacate the room and find fresh air, and I spent the rest of the day surfing my iphone for alternative accomodations. Then later on the second day, we were called and told that one villa would open up that afternoon and be available for us to move in. They indicated that it was being used for a photo shoot that day. When we got to the new villa, it couldn't have been more different. While in the same category (Ocean View Gold 2 bedroom) as the previous, and while the view was not \"as\" priceless as the first villa, every single detail of this villa was top notch. Every fixture in the house from the beach pebble floor of the third bathroom to the palm leaf overhead fan, to every picture on the wall, to the kitchen accessories was brand new. The oven, fridge, and kitchen fixtures were all updated stainless appliances, and every draw of the kitchen was stocked with multiple bottle openners, ice cream scoops, cheese cutters, 5 styles of mug/cups, glasses for any drink imaginable. Each room was furnished with local authentic local artwork, flat screen TV's and surround sound. Both bedrooms were were masters, and a full pull-out queen from the new sectional. I doubt any of the current advertisements show anything as nice as this villa. But when you're paying $600 a night for the villa (actually $450 with the deal I got: buy 4, pay 3), you shouldn't be subject to the vagaries of the owner. Management needs to insure all rooms are upto a standard of decor, age, and cleanliness. While I ended up quite happy with the second villa, I lost a full day surfing the net for alternative accomodations, and quite easily could have found myself in an emergency room with a child with respiratory ailments. After spending thousands on flights from the US east coast, there's just too many complaints about some villas. On other notes, the sharing facilities with the RItz is top notch. The staff at the pools, and especially at the beach are terrific. The food down at the DT Fleming beach was wonderful. Consider shopping at the Honolua store on the resort. Terrific breakfast food, and fair prices, and well equipped for a small market. Prices at the normal grocery stores on Maui are outrageous. You can get basically the same prices at the Honolua store without the hassle. Rather than spending $80-100 for breakfast for a family of 5, grab a bite at Honolua. And the whales...been to Hawaii 4 times before and had never seen a whale. At this time in late February, at any one time you could look out towards Molokai and see a combination of 4 or 5 water spouts or the back/dorsal fin of a whale, and about once per minute one would breach -- all day long for 3 days. On a walk on one of the rock outcroppings down at the beach, a mother and father, and it offspring swam beachward of us and then came out within a 100 m of where we were standing. But given the crap shoot that is villa selection you end up with, I've given an overall of 3, averaging a 1 with the 5. I really could not recommend the Kapalua Villas given the uncertainty in what you would get.

This area of Maui is tropical and beautiful - we love it. the location of these villas is good if you have a car - beaches are nearby as is hopping and food. BUT... This was our first time staying at the Kapalua Bay Villas. The particular villa we stayed in was unit # 28B2. I had originally booked an 'ocean view' - 'gold' unit because of the floor plan (a 2 bedroom). When we checked in we discovered we had been 'upgraded' to an 'ocean front' 2 bedroom. This unit had a an open floor plan with the master in a loft area open to the living area below - totally inappropriate for a family with teenagers - no privacy and no barriers for light or noise. I called to request a change , but was told 'everything was booked'. i appreciate an upgrade just like the next person, but this was not acceptable and not apples to apples. (by the way, the 'ocean front' view was squeezed between two other units and overlooking a landscaping shed) Here is an impressive list of what was broken, sub standard and services not performed in/for this particular unit: *electronic blinds were broken - we were unable to close them at night. management knew about this prior. *at least 4 other blinds were ripped and horribly stained. *dishwasher was broken - management knew about this, replaced it with another broken one (not nice to have repair men in unit for an afternoon!) *toaster was broken. *loft air conditioner was broken and so loud we couldn't run it. *loft carpet was buckled and stained in multiple areas and carpet was also stained on the stairway. *wireless internet in unit did not work - we used wireless from other nearby units *kitchen faucet leaked at based and flooded counter with every use (we were told \"part was on order') *dryer lint filter was broken - cracked and would fit into housing. *kitchen cabinet fronts were very dirty upon arrival - greasy and food debris everywhere *we only received 3 out of 8 days of daily newspaper delivery *the shower in the lower bedroom and in the guest bath could not contain the water spray and were totally soaked everywhere after each shower - my kids had to have multiple towel layers on the floor. (the door leaked in the guest and the bedroom bath was doorless) *furniture was worn, stained and chipped. cabinets gauged, appliances dented and scraped (this is more of a judgement call, but really tired appointments/furnishings) I called management about all the repairs needed, just the dishwasher was addressed directly which resulted in no improvement. i left a long message for the manager at check out, but did not get a return call. i own a high end rental unit in a resort area. i am familiar with the need to keep units up to date and refreshened as needed. this unit is poorly cared for and very very tired. it was far from the advertised 'gold' standard. It was very far and much below our expectations. i would hesitate to recommend the kapalua villas to friends because of this experience -using this is an example of their standard, i would not. As we walked around the property we could see into beautifully furnished and maintained units - these were either private units not in the rental pool or other better maintained units. if anyone decides to rent here, make sure you know exactly what you are getting - ask for unit pictures and floor plans. we will come back to kapalua, but not the 'kapalua villas'. you can get a much better deal for your your money at many other places. at $500+/night - even the ritz hotel down the road would be better deal!!

We initially booked the stay with Costco for a fairway ridge villa and upon check-in got upgraded to an partial-view golf villa 17T8. The unit was on the bay course fairway and in a loft style. I enjoyed the unit as it is perfect for a 2-some but might not be as private if it is more than 2 people. It's hard to tell how different the ridge villa is from the golf villa. I like the fact parking is right next door to us and it was easy to unload our luggage and food we bought from costco. We were told the resort fee covers unlimited international calls and free access to kapalua spa. We went straight to the spa after unpacking. The spa is brand new with jacuzzi pool/steam room/gym/swiming pool. we had a blast just unwinding after a long day. We also enjoyed the restaurants onsite including merriman's and sansei. The golf courses are gorgeous, the only downside is the plantation course is cart path only in preparation for the hyundai cup. The ladies tee is definitely challenging with some long par 3s and blind holes. I didn't play the bay course but my boyfriend said it was relatively easier and harder to lose balls. If you need a caddie, you should request them when booking the tee time. We weren't able to get one as they appeared to be highly in demand. The shuttle service inside the resort is very prompt and I used them many times to get to the spa and golf academy. I left my fleece on the shuttle once and was able to retrieve it after calling in. If you enjoy golf, I would definitely recommend going to Lanai to play the challenge and experience courses. We were able to get a great discount thru Maui Golf and the whole day trip including ferry and 2 rounds of golf came out around $300 per person. We also booked Kannapali Royal tee time thru Maui Golf and got a morning tee time for $160. Our last day, we drove to the crater around 11 am and was glad we didn't do the sunrise as the drive was quite challenging and can be dangerous in the dark.

The Villa was built in the 80's with some poorly installed Ikea updates. We had called ahead to make sure that they would provide us with a crib for our 2 year old son to sleep in after his long flight, and were disappointed to find that they had given us a play pen for him. When we called the front desk they told us that \"it was late and the people with the crib were on the other side of the compound\" so for the first night our son slept with us. Later that night we discovered a 3\" dead roach in the hallway and found another in the morning in a kitchen cupboard. The staff took us to look at other Villas, but our seemed to be the best of what we saw, so we decided to stay. Our second day didn't get better, after complaining to the front desk we were assured that we would get a crib delivered in the morning. When we arrived back in our room at 1pm for our son's nap there was no crib, but they had also taken the playpen. The crib showed up an hour later after our son's nap. We also we visited by some hotel staff who were sent to set roach traps around our kitchen, they informed me that the Villas were old and overrun with roaches and were regularly fumigated on a monthly basis. Upon hearing this and the fact that my wife refused to unpack her bags for a fear the roaches I decided to contact the general manager and played phone tag with him for the rest of the day. Our third day started with us heading to the beach to find upon our return a notice from the city that the power to the Villa had been cut off due to the owners not paying their bills. When I finally got face to face with T.J. to discuss this he mentioned that Air Canada had got me a really good rate on the room, implying that we didn't pay a lot for our room and shouldn't be complaining. We were offered a free night credited back to us and no charge for a late check out and were moved to another comparable Villa. Again we were promised that a crib would be set up when we returned from a show that evening. When we returned that night we were locked out because the staff gave us the wrong keys and the crib was not there. Fourty-five minutes later the crib arrived and I had to pull the pins and remove a door so that staff could roll it into our room. when I mentioned this to T.J. the next morning he offered us another 1 night credit.

The owner was very responsive and helpful in giving us many ideas of how to spend our time--and graciously allowed for a late checkout as well! The keyless entry is so easy to use! Our kids loved memorizing the code and working it. Nice to not have to worry about lost keys too. Everything was as advertized in the photos and we were thrilled with the space in the condo. For a family of 4, with 2 young children, the murphy bed was perfect for the kids as we could easily pack it away during the day. The condo is very spacious and was STOCKED with everything and anything you could possibly need-beach umbrellas, coolers, picnic supplies-even a sushi roller! We could even print out our boarding passes on the wireless printer and internet worked ALL the time. It was wonderful to have a washer and dryer too! The bedding was high quality as well. There is a good view of the ocean even though it isn't ocean front (saw whales easily from the lanai-there is a back deck as well). The pools were great-the Ritz was nice to use for something different --you can use for free as a Bay Villa guest (ie. hot tub is there and not at the Bay Villas) and the beaches were gorgeous-often with few people on them! There is a great coastal trail nearby as well for walking/running and hiking at Mahana Ridge Trail too (if you like a dirt trail with high grasses with no climax-went almost 9 miles in the grass-minimal views). In terms of location, we were hesitant about where to stay on Maui and are so glad we picked the Kapalua Bay Villas--and this part of the island. The area is much less commercialized, with fewer people. If you like to walk outside your room to new restaurants and shops each night and have many tourists with loud hawaiian shirts on the streets beside you or time share salesmen trying to solicit you, this is NOT your place. If you are, however, looking for a quiet getaway within walking distance to MANY gorgeous beaches (where we saw sea turtles) -ie. DT Flemming -and within very close driving distance to Napilia, Kahana and relatively close to Kaanapali and Lahaina, this is perfect. We enjoyed finding our own deserted beaches at night to watch the sunset from. There are a few restaurants that are excellent that you can walk to as well-ie. Merriman's and Sea House-(great $5 and under \"pupu's\" before 5pm). Overall, this is a very safe, quiet, well maintained complex! I would definitely stay here again! A couple of highlights... -Running a local 1/2 marathon-Iao Valley to Sea-check it out if you are visiting in March next year!~ http://www.valleytotheseahalfmarathon.com/Valley_to_the_Sea_Half_Mara.php or just visit the Iao Valley State Park-it is off the beaten path and a neat place. -Picking our own pineapples -Driving further north west to see the surfers at Honolua Bay (actually saw a guy long boarding with his dog!), hiking to the blow hole and getting shaved ice at Lorraines -the chocolate covered banana bread ice cream sandwich is better sounding than tasting-(apparently shaved ice is the thing to eat in Maui)-interesting one lane road -The road to Hana--LOVED the Wai'anapanapa's black sand beach and lava caves and red sand beach (harder to find--definitely off the beaten path-off Uakae rd-where it deadends-walk back by the light poles-on the side of the community center. Not an easy path especially barefoot when your flipflop breaks. get some of Gary's coconut milk ice cream (coconut porter made from the beer or avocado pistachio)-YUM-eat it from coconut shells -Watching the surfers on the way back from Hana-Hookipa Beach Park-AMAZING! -Whale watching -Ultimate Whale watch so you are on a zodiac -as they can get closer than the big boats-go at 8:15 so you get a cheaper deal! Or- just watch whales from the beach at the villas -Maui Brewing Company-good vegetarian food/gluten free and good beer of course -Saver's thrift store on Dairy rd by the airport-great stuff! -The views were breathtaking!!!! standing on the rocks outside the Bay Villas takes your breath away. The water is soo many different shades of blue! Do know that: -Kapalua can be windy in the winter!!! If you turn the corner and head South at all it seems to really calm down. It doesn't get near as hot as Lahaina though. -In March we had to either head south or more west to see the sun set fully--you can't watch it set right in front of the complex--at least from the ground units -We love to walk so Kapalua worked well for us as we could walk to so many beaches, the Ritz and so forth. It is a hilly area though so if you do not like to walk, be prepared to drive. If you are a runner, be prepared to have some major aches and pains after running these hills!

The Bay Villas are closer to ocean BUT your view is obstructed by the lower sloping 'ocean front' villas so you are looking at roof tops. The ridge is well above roof tops and has panoramic 180 of the ocean and you can still hear the surf. The whole of Kapalua is an immaculately kept community of well appointed condos - with easy access to 3 beaches and on site Golf Course (Bay) a couple of affordable restaurants and small grocery store. The management is extremely accommodating - you couldn't find nicer people. We came in at 2 am and were shown to our villa by security that happened to be touring around. We were assigned a lower level villa (ask for upper level - better view and more private). There was scaffolding on both sides of our balcony - ongoing maintenance is a mixed blessing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Next day after mentioning this they offered us a beautiful Bay Villa which we checked out but passed on for reasons above. Rather than closing out discussions, Tamara (who is a wonderful hostess) offered us a two bedroom villa - a whole top floor condo for the full two weeks. They supply cleaning products, toiletries, make up your bed every day and supply clean linen every 3 days. Regular spraying to keep out the bugs (they advise you when spraying.) They supply transportation to wherever you want to go (if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rented a car \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even if you have) You exit the van in the middle of large 14 seater so no pressure or expectation of tip. There is a phone number and they magically appear within 5-10 minutes. I was told by the driver that they would have come pick us up at airport *even at late hours* \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something I was told by the reservation desk that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do. So two thumbs up for the accommodations. Here are some tips. Car rental at airport. They close at 11 pm. They ALL have shuttles that take you to the car rental agency. While one of you waits for the luggage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the other should take the shuttle and come back with the car. What they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you on the phone is that they will stay open until 3 AM if they have to to wait for reservations if plane gets in late. Give them a call let them know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming. We rented a subcompact from Dollar and were upgraded to a convertible for only $200 extra \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so instead of paying $2000 for a convertible, we got a steal for $700 for two weeks. I suspect you make these deals at the pickup time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it at booking. Convertible only way to travel in Maui.

It has the usual recommendation of places to eat & shop with history backgrounds etc but has details on locations of attractions not mentioned in the flyers but more importantly details on how to access them - i'm talking about finding a trail past the second telephone pole after the wooden fence details. Visitors mention Costco. Wal Mart, K mart in Kahului but this is NOT practical living in Kapalua (50 minutes drive and very bad traffic) Luhaina has a Safeway for food and WallGreens has the other stuff you need (boogie boards $8 cheaper than everywhere else etc). There is a handy general store in Napili open until 11 pm and another just up the road open until 2 am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c avoid Kapulua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Honolua Store for food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they do have a popular take out though. The one place we went back to several times to eat was the Aloha Grill on Front Street right on the ocean (straight down from Safeway) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mai Tai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $3 in afternoon and a very tasty and well prepared mixed grill (fish,chicken,beef) for about $13. Most restaurants have entries that start at $26 so being able to both eat for under $30 is a bargain in West Maui. Order from the bar menu at the Pineapple Grill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their Asian Skewers are delicious and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get change from a fifty. I tried all the beaches in the area. Almost drowned on all of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the problem is the slope is very steep into the ocean so the surf (5-6 footers) break close to shore and just before they break have a very strong pull into the ocean . A very dangerous combination when you have no footing below you. I suggest Fleming Beach (a three minute drive from the Villas) - you can wade out quite a way because the beach slope is gentle. The waves break quite a way out and you can safely get a good ride into shore while keeping both feet on the ocean floor. Most importantly there is a lifeguard on duty and he watches for and alerts you to rip tides. See the Blow Hole north of Kupalua \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will see a small handmade sign on side of road about 15 minutes from Villas. Big surfers go to Honolua Bay (10 minutes away) great view from top cliff and breath-taking sunsets. See the Needle in Lao Valley (found that out in my book) on your way to Kahului. Along Road to Hana, the Garden of Eden is well worth the visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (watch where you park in Pa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they have spotters everywhere eager to give you a ticket).", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "iliveinchicago", "ReviewID": "UR55889161", "Content": "We come to Maui every year and have stayed pretty much all over the island and Kapalua Bay Villas was the best place condo we've ever rented.

Snorkeling: We walked to Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Napilli, rented their best gear for a week and used it almost daily in Kapalua Bay. Our 11 year old daughter couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough of it. Highlights included turtles and a snow flake moray eel sighting. Golf: My husband took advantage of the 5 day unlimited golf package and golfed 7 times for $499. Our daughter participated in the Junior golf program and golfed FREE (including clubs!) after 2:00PM. Food: We bought groceries at Safeway in Lahaina and grilled several meals in one of the outdoor kitchens available at the pools. We also shopped for local produce at the Saturday Swap Meet in Kahului (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge and a great place to buy souvenirs too). Dining: Sansei has 25% off sushi from 5:30-6:00 daily. We got there at 5:00 and waited in line. The Pineapple Grill bar menu is 50% off from 8:00-10:00 on Friday and Saturday nights. A place we would not go to again is Merriman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Very high prices (even by Maui standards) and small portions. My soup was essentially 2 inches of broth in the bottom of an enormous bowl.

The resort is amazing, nothing like overcrowded Waikiki where we have stayed previously. This was serene and peaceful, and we had great accommodations. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a city next to a beach, this was the real Hawaii! Highly recommended! Kapalua If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the crowds but still want the luxury and beauty, you will like Kapalua. You can walk everywhere, or take the free shuttle available for guests. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful Hawaiian resort w/ everything you need. As far as dinning goes Kapalua has super high-end restaurants to cheap take-out. We ate at Marriemans for our romantic dinner, amazing food and the best view of any place we ate on Maui. For a few breakfasts and a lunch and a dinner we took advantage of the super casual Honolu Store. They have good, cheap food and a nice picnic style tables outside, or you can take it home. They have great breakfasts, pancakes and eggs and all that, and great \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hobo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lunches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you must see to believe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very good. The Honolu Store is where Rachael Ray visited and ate when she came to Kapalua in one of her episodes! We also saw pizzas and hamburgers as well as healthy stuff, so pretty much something for everyone. If you want to do Maui on a budget eat here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and also rent a place with a kitchen! Kapalua also had tons of walking trails which we really dug cuz we love the outdoors. There are coastline trails and mountains trails and everything in between. Really cool. They also have their own zipline courses! Pretty cool if you are into that, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get around to it but wish we had. And there is a resort shuttle that takes you anywhere in the resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for free. That was a nice surprise! There are nice golf courses and many tennis courts around Kapalua, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do either. We prefer the beach! Beaches The beaches at Kapalua were great, really great. Kapalua beach was the best with really great calm waters, just a super beautiful cove with all sorts of fish. Oneloa beach was super picturesque, like in a romance movie or something and then there was a beach in front of the ritz carlton hotel, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the name, but it was also nice and had a wave break and lifeguard. We mostly went to Kapalua beach which was also great for sunsets! And if you have kids you will want to take them there, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a calm protected beach. Accommodations We stayed in a one bedroom, two bathroom Ridge condo with an ocean view, ac and really nice furnishings for $150 a night. We had reserved covered parking right next to our front door. Condo had everything, washer/dryer, 2 TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s including a plasma, high speed Internet and large kitchen w/ utensils. They stock it w/ lots of towels and sheets before you arrive, only thing is they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have maid service, so we had to wash our beach towels, they also stock it w/ soaps and shampoo, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resupply it during the stay, so you have to bring or buy shampoo if you are staying for a while. We bought some at the store. We picked our condo out on their website, they have really big clear virtual tours of each condo, when we walked in we felt like we had already been there! http://www.kapaluavacations.com/the_ridge.asp There are two pools at the Ridge, very nice and they had gas grills which we used twice. The place was in the middle of the resort, so it was great for walking to the beaches or the coastal trail, and the restaurants, very cool. We rented from ridge realty, very nice family, highly recommended. Their office is right next to Maui Tacos where you can buy huge $5 burritos! So again, if you are doing Maui on a budget, go to Maui Tacos as well as the Honolu Store and as well as cooking in your condo! We did these things and saved a ton over our last trip to Hawaii when we stayed on Oahu in a hotel room which was much smaller, not as nice and cost way more. Oh, and there is a Costco by Kahului Airport, across the street from Crispy Cream, if you really want to save money just buy a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply of food there on your way and cook meals in your condo.

However I must say thank you to whoever wrote a review saying you need to ask for a luxury condo - that's what we did and we couldn't have been happier. And the price was still significantly cheaper than any of the hotels. Since the Villas are part of the Ritz you get every amenity available. We spent our time going between the pool at the Ritz and the various beautiful beaches. Although the Villas are spread out across the large grounds (a downside if you like walking everywhere) they have a shuttle that drops you any where you want to go on the property and we never waited more than 10 minutes for it. The service there was also amazing. The concierge was so helpful - she made dinner reservations for us and booked a great snorkel trip and helicopter ride. The only real downside to Kapalua is that it's far from the rest of the island. It's close to Kaanapali and Lahaina (where we spent most of our evenings) but far from the airport and other popular areas. We had a car so we were fine driving places but if you like to be in a more active, populated area this probably isn't for you.

The ocean view was much better, but I guess I figure for what we paid, they should have gave us a complimentary upgrade to something away from the work zone. The floor plan was very nice -- two bedroom, two baths, kitchen, living room and dining room. The lanai was nice also, but with the trade winds, it was actually too cool to sit on the lanai. Most of the suite was clean, but there were (dead) insects on the window sills in the shower area. As for the resort itself, it's very spread out. I believe I'd have actually preferred staying at the Ritz Carlton on the resort. Without a car, you'd be at the mercy of the shuttle. We went into Lahaina most nights -- Front Street -- very nice, lots of shops, galleries, restaurants and bars. As for the golf... we were not able to play the Bay course as it was under some construction. We did play the Plantation course (Mercedes Benz tournament course) at $240 for an afternoon round. Maybe I was naive (although we had played at Turtle Bay in Oahu and Poipu in Kauai), but this was, well, ridiculous. Forget the winds, which they can't control, but the staff was not at all helpful. More like they were doing you a favor for letting you play their course. Sorry, but the layout was not that spectacular or special.... go to Poipu on Kauai or the Palmer course at Turtle Bay on Oahu. Of course, I can say (I tried) to play Kapalua now. All in all, if I were to go back to Maui, I wouldn't stay here.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cService has deteriorated\u201d", "Author": "KippyWLA", "ReviewID": "UR28159666", "Content": "We have stayed at the Kapalua Villas many times and returned this year for spring break.

We had to wait a long time for a shuttle from the Kapalua airport because when we called for a pick-up we kept getting lost in an answering machine. We had to wait for a long time for our Villa to be cleaned so we could check in, so we went to the little store near the front desk for lunch. The line was long, wait time was long, and the workers were short and rude to customers. The food was not worth waiting for either.

Everyone was very helpful and pleasant. There was road construction close to our villa which began on about the third day of our stay. Management called and apologized and offered to move us to a different condo which we declined. The only problem the noise presented to us was that we did not sit on our balcony to have coffee in the mornings. By three or four in the afternoon construction had stopped and we were able to enjoy happy hour outside. Yes, Kapalua is a little off the beaten path but we knew that before we arrived. It is just a short drive to shops and restaurants in Ka'anapali and Lahaina. I will agree that the weather is a little cooler and the wind can be a little stronger at this end of the island, again this was something we already knew before booking. Families with young children might be happier with a different location. As others have the stated the pools are basic but very well kept. I rather enjoyed using the pool at the villa. At any given time there were just a few people at the pool. We did go over to the pool at the Ritz one afternoon which was very nice but probably had a 100 plus people there and lots of kids. There is that option for those who prefer that. We really enjoyed the the Pineapple Grill at Kapalua. I'm sorry some people were not happy with their stay at Kapalua.

I just returned from my annual March vacation at the property. Kapalua is one of the finest properties on the island, as I have seen its master plan unfold over the years. Anyone looking to stay at this property needs to understand the resort's layout. This is truly a residential style property with resort amenities. There is everything from affordable to very high-end condos, moderate to very high-end private homes, a Ritz-Carlton hotel, and soon to be complete a Ritz-Carlton Club timeshare complex (under construction to be completed in Summer 2009-replacing the Bay Hotel which was a gem), and two world class golf courses. Many of us that return regularly are a little unhappy with the whole timeshare concept within the property, as well are may of the \"real\" owners in Kapalua, but that is how development goes. There are outstanding restaurants and a general store (Honolua) on the property, as well as three spectacular beaches (snorkeling and diving), accessible and smaller quiet pools (except for the Ritz pool which has the hotel crowd and pool-side service), and stunning coastline and mountain trails. This is the complete opposite of travelers looking for hotel complexes in groups like Wailea or Ka'anapali that are sited beach front. Again, do your research as to what you are looking for. The new project is adding a spa to the property for those that are interested. The grounds are stunning and well manicured, the villas range from oceanfront, to oceanview, ridge and golf (fairway) accomodations. As the villas are privately owned as condos, they are available through different real estate groups. You need to do your research and also know how the owner has kept their villa updated and who manages it for them. This makes a world of difference on the interior amenities, quality and cleanliness. The exteriors are all consistent, with the exception of views and location within the property. Once you have stayed on the property, it is much easier to understand, as the overall Kapalua \"property\" covers 20,000+ acres, some of the finest on Maui. You can rent everything from a one-bedroom villa all the way up to a 10,000+ private home. Again, it is all in what you want for amenities. I have stayed in several units over the years and have my favorites, some are stunning and can be like a home away from home. I prefer the Bay VIllas as I like to be near the water. Others prefer the ridge or golf villas to be nearer the courses. Many villas have been upgraded. but many have not, again at the choice of the villa owner. The Kapalua Villa rentals on property have a generic \"gold\" standard (recently upgraded) that owners must meet to be in that price range, otherwise if you go with a standard unit, the interior could be original (approx. 25 years old). There are several owners that do not rent, some live on property and several who use other real estate companies off-site as other reviews have stated. The very particular owners with nicer units will do that, but they are also careful on renting to protect their investment, of which I can not say I blame them. I have done both, and have the best results with the off-property agents, as they work for individual owners, where the on-site rental agency puts their condos into a pool, and it is a draw on arrivals as to what unit you get, availability, and the \"upgraded\" condition of that unit. The property tends to be more on the exclusive side, a little pricey, away from the \"touristy\" parts of Maui, but well worth the money spent. There are some good deals for Kapalua, just do your homework. There are several smaller shopping areas nearby, a post office, and the main West side town of Lahaina all within 5-15 minutes of the property. Kapalua is the real Hawaii if you want to see the beauty and have a true break from the hustle of everyday life. If you like being in the middle of the tourist craze, Kapalua may not be for you. It is an elegant, beautiful location where at times you almost need not leave the location, unless you want to. The main airport is less than 40 minutes across the island, but well worth the drive along the water as you head up the West coast of Maui, as that is the Leeward side of the island where the sun sets, whales linger and rainbows abide. If a traveler has had a bad villa experience, again I highly recommend doing the research. The reviews I have seen here that are not favorable are clearly units not well maintained and some are more than likely poorly maintained on the interior. For those of us who return regularly, and there are many many of us that do, as I have made friends at Kapalua over the years, it is truly a great vacation destination. If you are looking to stay in a hotel with glamorous lobbies, limited view, fancy room service, lavish pools and a small room with four walls, look elsewhere. If you are looking for accomodations with privacy and quiet, almost like being at home, Kapalua is a true gem. The accomodations work for my taste, but may not for someone else. The villas are decorated and upgraded to the owner's taste, and some of them are truly exquisite, but also hard to get availability for obvious reasons. Just know what you are renting, and who you are renting it through. A couple of good reminders......respect the residents and locals here and they will respect you. If folks are rude, then rude is what you will get back. Things move a little slower and gentler on Maui, and recognizing that goes a long way! Kapalua is 5-star, very provate and one of the nicest locations I have traveled to around the world. Best of luck and enjoy.

However, on my last visit there - my first one since 2003 - I was deeply disappointed with the experience. The villas themselves are nice enough with nice, if inconsistent, decor. The locations are convenient, although you do need a car (or take the free shuttle bus) to get around the resort. The shopping is also pretty far away. Now, here are the problems: 1. The staff is incompetent and rude. I was defrauded for almost $2000 by the staff at Kapalua due to failure by them to properly acknowledge the return of my rental car. I spent numerous weeks writing emails and making expensive international phonecalls to sort out the mess. After it was all said and done, I got no formal apology, no compensation and no admission of the error from their side. Nice. 2. The room was not cleaned properly. It was dusty and dirty when we came in the cleaning crew only give at very cursory cleaning each time they came in. 3. The old Kapalua Bay Hotel is now gone and there is a big construction site there now. The old hotel with a large open-air foyer was a great focal point for the resort but now it doesn't have the same \"cohesion\". The Ritz-Carlton hotel is too luxurious and \"closed\" to make it a good replacement. 4. The prices have gone up considerably and the golf rates for resort guests are outrageous. If you are a Hawaii resident (my friend is) then you pay less than a third of the normal fee. If you are a resort guest you only get a 20% or so discount. Despite the poor economy, they've jacked up the rates even higher in 2009. The Plantation Course green fee is now $298! Considering the amount of money it costs to get there for most people they really need to make their golf rates more reasonable. 5. They closed the third course, The Village Course. This was a great course and a big draw for those of us who used to stay for two weeks and wanted some variety in our golf games. Bottom line is, the only reason to stay here is if you really love the Plantation or the Bay Golf Courses and you can't afford to stay at the Ritz-Carlton (which is very good, btw).

We spent 5 days in Kapalua and 6 days in the Kaanapali area. Weather was cold, rainy and VERY windy. We've been to Maui many times, mostly in the winter and have never experienced this. Kind of puts a damper on the whole trip. We arrived at Kapalua Villas around 11pm... it had been raining since the plane landed. We were taken to our Bay Villa (gold) and settled in. Found several small cockroaches and quickly dispatched them. I've lived in Tucson....these Hawaiian guys are pretty wimpy in comparison. The villa was absolutely gorgeous. Huge windows both in the bedroom upstairs and in the living room -- incredible views. Beautifully decorated, granite kitchen. Problem was, the windows and the lanai faced the bay. We saw humongous waves, surfers and kite-surfers (very cool) -- but we were there to see the whales. No whales in the bay. But then it had been waaay too cold, rainy and windy to spend a lot of time looking. The next night we cooked a Costco pizza, took a couple pieces in to eat while watching TV, came back into the kitchen to get another piece and those little cockroaches had invited all their friends over for pizza. It was truly disgusting. We asked to move, trying not to make a huge thing out of the bugs... Hawaii has bugs, I know that. I'm not phobic about them but the pizza thing was too much even for me. They moved us into another Bay Villa which was also supposedly \"gold\" but it was nowhere near as nice as the first. We now had a view of the whales (at least we would have if the weather would have cooperated -- its tough to spot them in an ocean of whitecaps), the bedroom lanai overlooked the parking lot, only one bathroom and quite cheaply done, as compared to the first villa. However, not one bug. Kapalua is a beautiful area. The grounds are immaculate. Will be REALLY nice when the construction is done (we didn't hear a peep from them). According to the locals, its usually around 5 degrees cooler up there than in places south, like Lahaina. That could be good in the summer.

This year our unit had fine new furniture, no marble or heavy dark furniture, well stocked kitchen , nice new bedspreads, new couch etc and fully loaded with amenities and the same gorgeous, drop dead ocean views for half the price!- we even had a telescope facing the ocean and lots of mirrors all around the bedroom so that ocean was 360degrees. We were a little concerned before we got there about the difference in cost between the two rent organizations The Villa and The Ridge- that we would not get something nice, but boy were we pleased!. It turned out great. Our unit was perfect and half the price of last year!!! We had a slight problem with a faucet and the management (Bill) who lives in one of the neighboring Villas was there in a flash. Couldn't have had better servicing.

It's the first time we rented a villa and were kind of nervous about it. We are definitely hotel people, but thought we would give it a try. The villa was very nice and updated. We had an oceanfront unit. They said they had daily housekeeping for the gold units, so I was happy about that. As soon as we walked into the villa we noticed it had a moldy, musty smell. I have allergies, but thought once the windows were opened up it would be fine. It didn't go away, so we called for maintenance to come and change the AC filter. He came, took the filter, said he would be right back and never showed up again. The AC also didn't work well in the bedroom. It was so stuffy in there and smelled bad. I had such a headache and was so stuffed up that I couldn't wait until we left there. That's no way to feel in paradise. The next day housekeeping came, pulled the covers up on the bed, left new towels and emptied the trash. She then took a dirty rag and wiped the table and the counters down with it. That grossed me out. The table was all smeared and filmy. I asked if she could get us some windex or the like and she said she would drop someoff for us. We never saw it. The floor was so sticky from the salt spray that I had to wear my slippah's. My feet turned black because the floors were dirty. We know they don't wash the floors in between guests because we found a ring from a coffee cup on the floor in the water closet. It had the coffee stain stuck to the floor. I guess a previous guest like to drink coffee while taking care of business. The housekeepers were in and out in less than ten minutes. The commode was never cleaned and the sinks wern't wiped out. The floors wern't vacuumed either because my husband spilled some powder on the rug and it was still there when we left five days later. The livingroom rug was all stained and we found two baby cockroaches in the bathroom sink. People always say, but it's the tropics and you will have cockroaches. I have never had a cockroach in any other place I have stayed at on the islands, so that doesn't hold water as far as I am concerned. Where there's baby cockroaches, theres a mama not far behind and perhaps a few hundred siblings too! We saw the exterminator spraying a unit a few doors down from us that they were rehabing, so I know that they have them there. I don't know if they do regular spraying, but perhaps they should start. Oh I lied, we did have a huge cockroach once at the Hyatt Kauai. This was eight years ago on our first trip to the islands. I had never seen a cockroach before, so when we checked in there I went out on the lanai to see our view. It was nightime so I couldn't see so well. I saw this huge bug on the ceiling of the lanai and showed my husband the cute, big bug. I must have left the lanai door open and the big, cute bug got in and was crawling on my husban's neck at 2:00AM. We called security and the security man told us it was a cockroach. I was beside myself but got over it. I had let him in by accident. He wasn't already in there like at the Bay Villa's. I went out and bought some cleaning supplies and cleaned it myself. I do have to say that the view was breathtaking, but it was so windy that we couldn't sit out on the lanai much. We sat out on another small lanai off the bedroom that faced the parking lot. If you need lots of space, have a large family, don't mind cleaning the villa yourself and like crawly critters then this may be the place for you. It's too bad that the houskeeping was so bad because they used high end cabinets, granite conters and top of the line appliances in these gold villa's.

This was my first visit to Maui and after debating Kapalua vs. Wailea, were were pleased we stayed in Kapalua. Again, after debating hotel vs. villa, we were impressed with our choice of the Kapalua Villas. First let me say that I was sure I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons Wailea. But my boyfriend is an incurable romantic and insisted on Kapalua. I certainly am happy that I listened to him. Wailea reminded me of an upscale suburban vacation community transplanted onto the beach in anywhere, USA. Walking down the path along the beach, you can turn up into any of the resorts lining it--sort of like wandering into different hotels on the Vegas strip. And the beach is so crowded--but not in a Waikiki way, with international tourists and surfers. I don't know really how to describe it more accurately except to say that it surely didn't feel like the secluded tropical paradise you think of when you imagine Maui. But Kapalua was its own quiet, verdant enclave of pines and a golf course with the Ritz Carlton at the far end on DT Fleming beach (a beautiful state beach park) and the Kapalua villas lining the hills and the bay. We had an ocean view 'gold' villa. I must admit I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews here. However, it was all for naught. Our villa was private and beautiful, with marble floors, a brand new kitchen, and a palatial marble bathroom. We both gasped when we walked in the door--we had floor to ceiling views of the ocean. Every morning as we ate breakfast on our lanai, we watched whales frolic in the ocean right in front of us! The other bonus staying here was that we had use of the Ritz Carleton pool. Although the villas have their own dedicated pools (one per complex), they are small and rather isolated--nothing to write home about. We never used our pool, preferring to relax at the Ritz and enjoy poolside service. Then at the end of a daily we'd return to the privacy of our very own beach home! Finally, the service at the villa was like that of a hotel--twice daily, with turndown service and bottled water at night. They even augmented the laundry detergent suplly daily. I feel bad for the people who posted complaints about cockroaches and old, dirty villas. That couldn't have been further from our experience! It was nearly perfect. My only complaint is that every day on the way down to our villa, we drove past active construction sites which reminded you--paradise is being continuously tucked into and developed.

We rented a two-bedroom ocean view villa through the hotel web site (Kapalua.com). To cut to the chase right away, I was expecting, as per the web site description \"Sweeping ocean views of the beautiful Pacific Ocean...\" from our villa. Instead, we had sweeping views of other condos and an extremely limited peek view of the ocean from the dining nook of our ground level unit. I was so shocked by the lack of view that I called the front desk to say we must have been put in a partial ocean view unit by mistake. The manager indicated the Bay Villas are their \"top of the line units\" and yes we did indeed have an ocean view unit. I asked to be moved to a unit with an unobstructed ocean view and he said all two-bedroom units were booked and we couldn't be moved. So, this was one big disappointment. As for the unit itself, it was very spacious with two-bedrooms and three bathrooms. But, it was an outdated, luxury wanna-be accomodation. The dresser in the kid's room was completely unusable with drawers that tilted precariously and threatened to fall on bare feet if used - the slides were partially broken and there were no drawer stops. Two of the three sink stoppers did not work. The kitchen knives were low quality and some basic knives - like a bread knife - were missing. There was no cutting board to slice fruit or cut bread for sandwiches. The bath towels were small. Although I must say that the two main bathrooms themselves were beautiful with the showers in a large tiled area surrounded by wood. The closet in one of the bathrooms had folding doors that kinked the wrong way and were difficult to open. Good things about the unit included a washer and dryer with soap, full kitchen with dishwasher and soap, air conditioning (although it was too loud to use during the night), lots of closet space, and plenty of room to spread out. Overall, the area is beautiful although it was quite windy every day we were there. The kids swam at the D.T. Fleming beach and Kapalua Bay and preferred Kapalua Bay for the clearer water that was good for snorkeling. The Ritz pool was available to us (there is an $18/day resort charge) and the kids enjoyed that also although it is difficult to find a chair out of the sun unless you rent one with a shade. We took a shuttle to the Maunalei Arboretum Trail and enjoyed the walk so much that our group was motivated to hike all the way back to the resort (about 6 miles). I recommend doing this in the morning while the day is cool. We had lunch at the Honolua Store which has a great selection of breakfast and lunch items that I recommend highly - you order at a counter and eat at tables outside. For general info, there is a Safeway in Lahaina to stock up on groceries and a Costco near the airport where someone in our group said they stop at to get snorkeling gear. The kids really enjoyed the stay but I would be extremely hesitant to return to the Kapalua Villas. Maybe it works better if you book a Gold Villa - another family in our group booked a Gold ocean view unit and had a wonderful view and a more luxury feel. At a minimum, maybe you should always specify a top floor unit to at least have a fighting chance of getting a view.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPerfect View of Paradise\u201d", "Author": "jerseygirl5555", "ReviewID": "UR17111565", "Content": "We rented unit 30 B-1 of the Bay Villas through vrbo.com and just got back to reality after a week in paradise.

The unit was clean with an updated kitchen , new carpet in the living room, new flat screen TV and an enormous bathroom. Everything was working and in tip top shape. Our child slept in the sleeper sofa overlooking the ocean every day. One concern we had when renting was the ongoing construction. We never heard any construction, even though it was quite close. The construction did prevent walking access to Kapalua Bay Beach, but they have a nice public lot to access that beach nearby. We could access Oneola beach fairly easily (a walk down a path). The reason we loved this location was that it was close to Lahaina, yet it was quiet and peaceful. If you're looking for a spot to party all night, perhaps Kapalua isn't for you. This location was a bit windy, but it was really welcome on those 90 degree days when it was unbearable in Lahaina. The property was beautifully landscaped and maintained.

Based on reviews we rented a 2 bedroom 3 bathroom condo at Kapalua in the Ridge complex with Ridge Realty Rentals. The location could not have been better! We had a very great wide ocean view. We could see the islands of Molokai and Lanai and the sunset. FYI it was villa 2614. We ate on our lanai most nights and watched the sunset while the kids played in the grass, it was amazing. We paid $375. The villa was surprisingly large, much larger than it looked online. The three bathrooms and the kitchen had not been remodeled but were high quality and much nicer than a remodeled condo we once stayed in at Kaanapali five years ago. The furnishings in the bedrooms and the living room looked new, and were very nice. (check out the pictures). All the kitchen appliances were new, which was great because we are a family (six people including our kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends) and we cooked almost every night. For $375 I think we got a great place. We met a honeymoon couple at the pool that paid over $400 for a 1 bedroom gold condo with the Kapalua Villa Program. They could not believe what we paid. The service was also great. The Ridge people were very nice and helpful. The condo had air conditioning, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it. We are environmentalists and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to waste energy, plus you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need air conditioning in Kapalua. The weather in Kapalua is the best in all of Maui. There was a constant trade wind breeze that kept us cool. The villa was also close to the Ridge pool, which was nice for the kids. If you have kids I recommend Kapalua, another great thing for kids is the free shuttle. You just call it and it comes to your condo and takes you anywhere in Kapalua at no cost. Our kids and their friends used it a couple times to get lunch at a place called the Honuloa Store. The food is cheap there (compared to the rest of Maui, ha!) and really good. I recommend the Honuloa Store too. FYI everything is expensive in Maui so stop at Costco next to the airport when you first get there and stock up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 especially if you have kids!

We had a partial ocean view off our lanai, which saw the Island of Lanai in addition to the ocean, the Bay Course golf course, and several of the Golf Villas. The architecture of the buildings on site are either quaint (churches, stores, little schoolhouse) or easily blended into environment - no garish high-rises here, like down in Kaanapali. We were struck with awe in looking at all the Cook Pines on the property. They really define the resort better than any other landscape element here. We were greeted at check-in with a nice glass of pineapple juice and a thorough description of services provided. We were provided with covered parking near our villa, and when we unlocked the door and walked in, we were quite revlieved with what we saw. Our two-bedroom Gold Villa was well-appointed with granite countertops in the kitchen and bathrooms. Appliances, fixtures, furniture and carpeting met the level of luxury expected from the room rate, and all were clean and relatively new. The Honolua Store on property has everything you may need, though perhaps a bit expensive. Costco or Safeway elsewhere on the island will be better for your staples, but the Honolua Store is an excellent option for forgotten items, or delicious prepared foods. The Kapalua Activity Center (and Logo Store) also is a nice place for breakfast or lunch. The concierges there were more than happy to arrange our sunset catamaran sail, ziplining, and horseback riding. One amenity that was well worth the $18/day resort fee (which also covered wireless internet in the villa, parking, and a few other things) was the access to the pool and charging priveleges at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua. The pool and pool service there are second only to the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island.

My wife and I were in Bay Villa 23 G1 for 6 nights and were VERY reluctant to leave. So many positives, and very few negatives. I'll try to separate out my comments by category: Villa: Our 1BR/1 1/2 BATH villa was very well-appointed, modern, and spacious. Overall, solid 4-star accommodations. We had a great view of the ocean and enjoyed the sound of the waves lulling us to sleep each night. The bed was fairly soft and comfortable. The master bath featured a stone tub with shower. As others have mentioned, it is quite important to do research and request specific units when booking this property, as the standard villas vary considerably from one another. On the other hand, the Gold-level villas are all very nice and feature premium appliances/furniture/cabinetry/fixtures. However, our guests stayed in both Gold and standard villas and were very satisfied. As an additional note, some villas are only available directly through the owner. Prices through that channel may be lower than through the Villas office. Although renting from the owner means that the resort amenities (housekeeping, shuttle, Ritz access) are not included, these may or may not be worth an extra 50-100 per day for some. Amenities: Housekeeping- Extremely discreet, quiet, and flexible. We kept irregular hours, and they were still able to get the job done without approaching us repeatedly. They basically do light work only (make bed, take out garbage, run dishwasher). Shuttle- Variable, but generally good service. They typically arrived within 0-15 min of our target pickup time, which was perfectly adequate most days (we used our rental car on wedding day to be safe). They will take you anywhere on the property, and drivers are generally polite and accommodating. On one occasion, I was asked to \"please wait outside\" by the operator when I called for a shuttle, which I thought was rather rude. On every other occasion, the driver gave a knock on our door when he arrived. Resort Priviliges- All residents of the Villas can access the pool and have charging priviliges at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua. Since we had our wedding ceremony at the Ritz, these extras came in handy for some of our friends and family. The Ritz pool is very nice. Check-In/Out: Efficient and pleasant front desk staff. One charge was inaccurate on our bill, but was quickly remedied. The error was understandable, since approximately 20 people were staying at the resort who had the same first name, last name, or both! Location: We like the natural beauty and stunning views offered at this resort. In contrast, the resort \"complex\" of Kaanapali to the south seemed more crowded and artificial when we visited friends staying there. From our oceanfront villa, it was a 2-minute walk to a small but pretty beach and rock pools. Two other larger beaches were accessible via shuttle. Kapalua is about an hour from the airport and 20-30 min from Lahaina. We highly recommend this resort as a wedding site (see also our review of the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua coming soon).

The RItz still allows use of the pool, even though half has been converted to condos, and the Fleming Beach is just as good as always. Kapalua Bay Beach is still easily accessbile and the construction going on for the new Residences at the Ritz (former Kapalua Bay Hotel location) is not obtrusive at all. One of our three condos overlooked the construction site and it was a great view, great unit and no noise. Anyone that would complain about the noise is being completely unreasonable.

What a boring place!!! The unit was so dated it was unbelievable. Blue carpet, sunshine ceiling, no fan over the range.....and a beige microwave with a dial, all screemed 70's. And the bugs.....big as my thumb.....so at least they were easy to catch and dispose of. The units come in three different levels. V level being the top floor, T level being the middle floor and P level is the ground floor that is almost like going into a grotto although it walks out onto the course. You can't get any air flow going at night (I hate leaving the air conditioner on) because the one evening I left the windo open to get some fresh air, the people in the unit beside ours (that shares our grotto-like stairway out) stared right into our bedroom as they were leaving. Even being right on the golf course was boring and we only saw 3 groups of golfers on it the full week we were there. The pools were nice but small. And there are signs up all over the place...no motorcycles, no mopeds, no skateboards, no rollerblades. They really don't want teenagers. Everyone we met at the pool was a senior. The beaches were better, but you have to drive to them. And then if you go to Honolua Beach, where the snorkeling is good, there is no parking as the other hotels/condos park there overnight. So you have to park way back at the tennis courts and hike over. Or you go off to DT Fleming Beach which has great huge waves, terriffic for boogie boarding, the wind is wicked, so you have to sit on everything you own so it doesn't blow away. But lunch at the Ritz-Carlton Beachhouse was great, terrific atmosphere right there on the beach, but they charge $12.00 for dacquiris or $9.00 for fruit smoothies with every dish on the menu between $14 - 18. Lunch was a little expensive for 4. We have always stayed in Kihei in our 20 years of going to Maui. We landed up in Kapalua as FunSun Vacations had a last minute disagreement with the condo we normally stay at. So they offerred us Kapalua and we tried it for a new adventure. Never again.

This review comes a year too late, but I was thinking about my amazing vacation and I realized I owe it to future travelers to share my experience, just as those before me had done. This website is very helpful in getting real life reviews. I loved Maui and being in the Kapalua area. It is close to Lahaina (about 1/2 hour drive, if that) and lots of great surf and snorkel spots. The villas are located in the Kapalua resort area, which also includes a Ritz Carlton hotel, to which we had pool facility privileges (fancy) (though the pool by our villa was nice,simple and convenient). We truly spent most of our time at the gorgeous on site beach, which is even nicer than the one @ the Ritz. I am under the impression that the villas are individually owned. I believe this is why some people had great experiences and others did not. I believe there are four different villa complexes: Ocean Front, Ocean View, Ridge, and Fairway. The Ocean Front Villas are as there name implies, ocean front. Behind them are the Ocean View Villas (keep in mind, it is on a hill, so although the Ocean View Villas are behind the Ocean Front Villas, they are also above.) Above and behind those are the Ridge villas. The Fairway villas are on the golf course. I don't think they have ocean views, but are great for golfers. We lucked out and had an amazing villa, I believe at the Ocean View Villas (Email me and I will TRY to find the exact unit #, it was a year ago). We were downstairs in a two unit villa. It was very quiet and relaxing. We had a great view of the water. The decor was up to date (very Tommy Bahama) and extremely clean. We had a modern kitchen with all the usual appliances. The beds were very comfortable. Both bedrooms had private bathrooms. Very luxe! I highly recommend the Kapalua Villas, but I also recommend being very thorough about knowing exactly what your unit will be. I believe this can make a huge difference. Also when we were there, construction was going on. It was not near us (I THINK it was the Ridge villas), so we didn't care, but beware and make sure not to get a villa near there, unless the construction is done.

We contacted the Kapalua Villa vacation manager and told her what the other condo homeowners association manager had said. A Mr Bill Green. She said she would look into it and finally moved us to another unit which was alot better . We requested a credit for 2 nights vacation we were having here with no sleep for 3 nights. We have not seen the outcome yet. I do not recommend anyone to stay at these Kapalua Villas , at least in room 22T8. We were exhausted from moving again with no sleep.

Bill Green the homeowner association manager told us basically the owners have all the rights and can stay up as long as they want and he admitted the flooring was like a bass drum above us when people walked.

Kapalua villas gives you the right to use any of the facilities at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua. However, the hotel was a very far walk and I can usually walk anywhere. Apparently there is some kind of shuttle service. The beaches were not within walking distance either. All of the restaurants in this area are extremely expensive. We didn't even want to attempt to cook on the stove in the kitchen we had. It looked dangerous. Upon checking out the next morning, the desk people asked if we enjoyed our stay. My husband told them all of our complaints and they were unapologetic and not nice. We booked a new hotel in Wailea, the Marriott.

The Bay Villas are showing their age, but you can't beat the million dollar view. Our condo had been somewhat updated with newer furniture and appliances, but the tile was old, there were some ants and mold, and there was no A/C. This area of Kapalua seems to be windy all the time, but just a few minutes south at Kapalua Bay it was calm and much warmer.

No quiet breakfast on the lanai without trucks rumbling by. I had to ask my son to repeat himself the other day because a truck went by and that's all we could hear. Also, it's worth noting that the construction site is on the north end of Kapalua Bay Beach. You can watch the work being done as you relax on the beach. You can see the giant cranes looming over everything. And best of all, you can hear the trucks beeping and backing up while you snorkel. That's a real bummer.

We booked the condo for three reasons - 1) proximity to Kapalua Bay; 2) we wanted a quiet place to stay and 3) we like the convenience of a condo for the space and the kitchen. Of the three reasons, two worked out - the quiet area and the very nice condo. However, it rained a number of days in Kapalua and we weren't able to snorkel in the bay most days, so we wound up driving down to Kaanapali Beach often, where it was always sunny. Had the weather held up, we probably would have spent a lot of time at Kapalua Bay, it's a great beach. The condo itself was nice, great views and roomy, with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was great, but the shower itself was a bit awkward. So most of our showers were taken in the second bathroom, that had a regular, very nice shower. It was very quiet, which we enjoyed. Note the kitchen had a slight mildew smell. It was a Bay villa. The location is about a 20 minute drive from Lahaina, and about 10 minutes from Kaanapali. We like Kaanapali a little better (and have spent much time there before), as there is a nice walkway along the beach, there's a lot of shops and restaurants, and Black Rock is our favorite place to beach & snorkel. It's a little more touristy, but I have to say it's quite pleasant and convenient. However, depending on your preferences, you might like Kapalua if you don't want to go anywhere else; it's beautiful and quiet. Keep in mind the Ritz is closed for construction, and that limits the number of close dining choices. One other thing to note - the property gave us the opportunity to pick from three villas, and we picked one away from the construction going on near the beach, which was a good choice. There's plenty of villas where you can't see any of it, so just be sure to pick one of those. Stuff to do - we highly recommend Kimo's in Lahaina, the luau at the Hyatt was very nice if you like that sort of thing (pay the extra for the VIP tix), and if you do the road to Hana, take a tour bus - it's worth it.

I hope this report helps people as reports on here helped us. After many hours on the Internet researching we decided to rent at the ridge in Kapalua with Ridge Realty. Primary reasons were we could see the villa we were going to be in on their website (however, they did tell us it was possible, but unlikely we would be moved in the case of something breaking, someone starting a remodel next door or other major things) and they were much cheaper then renting from Kapalua Villas. The villa number was 1722 and it was $250 a night. It was what they call an ocean view upgraded. The villa was amazing. It had a high up panoramic ocean view. We could see all the way up the coast to Honolua Bay (where we took a great snorkeling trip). There was absolutely no noise from the construction of the new hotel. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even worry about construction noise if you stay at the Ridge. One thing we really liked about Kapalua is how lush and manicured it is, all of it, especially the Ridge grounds. The landscaping is really upper class stuff you would expect to see in Beverly Hills or something. Another cool thing, there was an actual coconut tree outside our condo with coconuts on it that you could just reach up and pick (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, but could have it was so short) and one condo over there was a banana tree with bananas that were almost ripe, it was so neat! The condo had a remodeled kitchen and one of the bathrooms had been remodeled, also the furniture was really nice and there was the biggest plasma tv I had ever seen in my life. There was also broadband Internet in the condo. The best part was waking up every morning to the great view. I took a picture from the bed but it is really much better in person.

However, all my concerns immediatly disappeared as soon as I entered the unit and saw the beautifully renovated, very spacious space. Our unit was tastefully decorated in an \"island\" motif, and the furniture (couches, beds, tables, etc.) was not only beautiful, but comfortable as well. Both of the bathrooms had been recently upgraded (the master bathroom housed a very large shower with one of those waterfall-type shower heads, while the other bathroom had a deep marble tub) and the kitchen looked brand new and came with shiny appliances (coffee maker, toaster, blender, fridge, oven & range, microwave etc). Another great thing about the kitchen was that it was equipped with all the utensils, flatware, glasswear and silverwear one would ever need (and more).

Half of our view from the living room was the construction. The next thing were the amenities. This place looked like it was stuck in the 70's. I complained to the front desk about our obstructed view but the only other unit available was right next door with similar amenities... wonderful. We decided not to let this ruin our day and went along with our day. When we returned at night to shower and sleep we found more displeasing things. The curtain in the bedroom doesn't cover the entire sliding door. This means no complete privacy and we were on the ground floor. The shower and countertops in the masterbath weren't clean either. I found some hair on the sink counter. The towels they provided also had small stains and one of their beach towels had leaves on it. It's like the maid dropped it on the floor outdoors, patted it off, and placed it in the closet. Despite this, we still stayed the night here because we were just too tired to deal with it. The next morning, I awoke with a dead bug on my back. Then we found multiple dead bugs around the villa. At that point, I was willing to fork out the extra money for a Gold Villa. Unfortunately, none were available. The only available unit was not a Gold Villa but an oceanfront unit. Despite our expressed displeasure with our unit, they still wanted us to pay the difference for the oceanfront if we wanted it. We decided to check it out because we thought it couldn't have been worse. We weren't wrong but that unit wasn't any better. The only thing going for it was the oceanfront. The construction was very close although not visible from that unit. No wonder this unit was available! It had the same feel to it and also looked like it was stuckin the 70's. At this point we were approaching check out time and we needed a new home. Our travel agent was able to find availability at the Wailea Marriott and we booked it. The best decision I made while at Maui. The Kapalua Villas only charged us for the night we stayed there plus the service charge. They offered no other compensation because their policy was a 2 night minimum and we were \"fortunate\" that they waived it for us... Our travel agent was also extremely displeased as they are listed as a 4 1/2 star accommodation. I guess if we booked the Gold Villas it may have been a different story. But accommodations in the same development should not differ that dramatically. I will say that the Ridge Villa section was very quiet for the one day we were there. The Honolua Store is conveniently located across from the Reception Center. Napili Bay is also just a short drive away and it's a great beach. It's also a short drive to Kaanapali and Lahaina.

My family goes back to Maui nearly every year, and each time we return to Kapalua Villas. The location is peaceful and gorgeous, away from the noise and crowds of Lahaina and Kaanapali. If you enjoy golf, this is your place, but even if you don't, the grounds are greener and more spacious because of the golf courses all around. The individual condo units do vary a lot in quality and decor, so ask to check out the place when you get there. Don't be afraid to ask to switch if something is really wrong. We once checked into a 2 bedroom unit which was infested with ants, rundown...I even found a small roach by the patio door and then a gigantic one inside my bedspread (which nearly caused me to have a coronary event). Once we alerted the property managers, they switched us to a beautiful, clean 2 bedroom with dizzying views. So keep in mind that no two units are alike here, as each is individually owned by private individuals. The pool areas, barbeques, access to Ritz Carlton facilities and Kapalua Bay beaches are what make this an excellent vacation experience (better than staying at hotels). It gives you the flexibility of going out to Napili Market and getting groceries and drinks, etc. when you have grown tired of eating out. Likewise, it is nice to be able to do a load of laundry during your vacation. Be sure to eat at least one meal at Sansei! (for us it is more likely to be two or three). Snorkeling at Kapalua Bay is usually excellent (better than you might even see at more advertised areas, because the shallow warm waters are almost a nursery for fish, eels, etc.) You are likely to see a bigger variety of fish there in that little bay than even some trips to Molokini.

All four of the one bedroom units we rented had sofa beds, and three had two full baths. If that is an issue, be sure to request two FULL baths! We went on the Refer a Friend program and received $250 vouchers to be used at the resort, so they guys basically got a free round of golf on the Plantation course (where the Mercedes Benz classic is held). We also got the 5th night free, so it was really a deal! The Ritz is on the propery, and you can use their facilities.

Plus, Kapalua Bay has some of the best snorkeling on the island, and it's a 5 minute walk from the condos. Also, I'd like to respectfully counter a few of the \"cons\" pointed out in the previous posting from the Oakland reviewer: -Winter weather is fantastic here -- I saw more rain in Lahaina than I did here. We stayed at Kapalua Feb. 10-17 (the heart of the winter season) and saw daytime rain for all of 10 minutes during 7 days. The bulk of the showers -- which are almost always quick -- seemed to happen overnight. As for the wind, I never noticed it being appreciably stronger in Kapalua than Lahaina. -The construction is actually a plus when striking a rental deal. I suspect our very reasonable rate was a result of the unit being right next to the very large construction of new Ritz-Carlton condos. However, the cranes made absolutely NO noise (and we were close enough to be able to wave to the operator from our patio). The only thing I heard was the occasional safety beep of a truck in reverse. We, too, experienced power outages, but I doubt these were due to the construction. The island has periodic brown-outs; the day we arrived, there was no power at the airport. -Don't worry about renting directly from an owner. We did, and when we did have a housekeeping concern, we were able to phone the concierge just like anyone else. I suspect they would have replaced the bbq gas if they'd been alerted. If anything, the one downside to the villas is their proximity from Lahaina and a lot of the other attractions. We ended up spending a lot of time in the Jeep shuttling back and forth from town -- and I say that as someone who lives in LA, where is a way of life.

We booked directly from the owner of this Bay Villa unit and not through the Kapalua Villas management, so our experience may be somewhat different than those booking through the service. There were many positives that made our trip amazing; however, there were a couple of negatives as well that colored our experience. Pros - The unit (in building 12) was absolutely, fabulously beautiful with a view unlike any other we've experienced in our many trips to Hawaii - The grounds were well manicured, lush, and very pretty - The proximity to Napili Bay and Kapalua Bay (in my opinion the best swimming areas on the island) - Proximity to the Ritz-Carlton, and other dining options in Napili and Kapalua - Watching the whales breach from our bedroom in the morning Cons - The weather in Kapalua in the winter, especially during our vacation, is awful. We woke up every morning to the sound of 30+ mph winds and torrential downpours. To be fair, there was a high pressure front approaching the islands so we expected less-than-stellar weather, but it seems that Kapalua received the brunt of the storm. Down the road in Lahaina, the weather would be gorgeous, while it was ugly and wet in Kapalua. - One of the pools in the Bay Villas complex is completely out of commission - empty and going through construction - The other pool is therefore used by everyone staying in the area and was a bit dirty - The grill in this pool area ran out of gas and there was no one who could help - Area construction: Kapalua is in the process of adding a number of luxury units to the area and there are many cranes and other construction vehicles working during the day. We couldn't hear them, but upon approaching the Bay Villas entrance, it is definitely a construction zone (we actually thought we were in the wrong place). Also, due to the construction, our power went out one morning and there was really nothing to be done about it. - If there are jacuzzis anywhere, I couldn't find them (and I looked!) All in all, our stay at the Bay Villas was nice, but not as peaceful or relaxing as I had hoped, and there were some things that should have been noted to us before we paid to stay there (pool, construction, lack of jacuzzis).

Instead, our unit looked like something from the set of Three's Company with extremely stained and tattered carpet. It was not the upgraded unit we were promised. That's the bad. Fortunately we had an incredible view which made us quickly forget how old and outdated our unit was. While Diane at Ridge Realty reluctantly offered us another unit, it did not have much of a view and so we decided to stick with the original unit. I'm not sure that I would book through Ridge Realty again. Now, to get to the good. Our unit was 1300 sq.ft. all on one level which we found very convenient plus it had a large grassy area in front of the lanai which made our lanai space seem much larger than it was. The villas are beautifully landscaped and it seemed like the landscapers work 24/7 to keep it that way. It was always a pleasure to return to the Kapalua area after a day spent exploring other parts of the island. There was no air conditioning in our unit and there was absolutely no need for it. The trade winds kept our unit so comfortable that we both slept like babies the entire trip. There was a pool area very close to our unit which we used a couple of times. It was quiet and again, beautifully maintained and manicured. We used the barbecue areas only a couple of times but found them to be very clean. Groceries are very expensive on Maui so we didn't cook as often as we originally planned. Kapalua beach is fantastic. The snorkelling is great and the beach very serene, despite the construction happening nearby. It's funny how quickly you can tune it out. We'd definitely return to the Kapalua area when we visit Maui again. We were there in September which is one of the hottest and driest months so we never experienced the bad weather others have posted. We found it very pleasant to return to the coolness of Kapalua after spending time in Lahaina or Kaanapali. But I think if you are travelling during the wetter months, staying further south might be the better plan. So, all in all, I definitely recommend Kapalua and the ridge villas.

The pools are surprisingly deep, and our 5 year old could only touch bottom at the steps. The Ritz Carlton pool allows access to Villa guests, but it lacks a shallow area, kids pool, slide, or other child friendly features. It is heated, unlike the condo pools. There is no playground at the villas, and the Ritz playground consists of one rickety wooden swing set. There is no children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity program at the Villas, and the Ritz Kids program is strictly off limits to villa guests. The independent Kapalua Art School on the grounds offers full and half day art and activity programs for kids. Our daughter enjoyed the arts and crafts, but she was the only one enrolled and felt a bit lonely and only went once. (they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually run programs for only 1 child; we got in because there had been another child signed up who cancelled.) OK fine, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have kids so it should be great, right? Not exactly. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any workout room at all in this vast complex, (I was told that there was) and the Ritz fitness center is only available if you book a spa treatment, meaning each workout would set you back well over $100! The Bay Villas are adjacent to a huge construction site (through 2008) and noise is constant 6 days a week, 7am to 5pm. The Ridge and Golf villas are farther from construction and quieter. Looking at a map, it appears you have easy access to 3 beaches. Not so easy, since the construction site blocks the footpath to Kapalua beach, and the steps down to Honolua beach are washed out, so in both cases you need to drive to public parking areas (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hauling beach gear with kids in tow, you might enjoy the long walk). Fleming beach is easily accessible from the Ritz, but too far to walk from the villas. Fleming and Honolua beach are far too rough, at least in winter, for all but serious swimmers or surfers. Kapalua beach was slightly calmer but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare with Kaanipali or Wailea beaches. (If you want peace and quiet, Kapalua Ridge or Golf villas are a good choice compared to those areas, however.) Kapalua has a reputation for windier, rainier weather than any other Maui resort area (A Ritz employee confirmed this-when my wife commented on the weather, he advised us to go south because its always better weather\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Granted, December is the rainiest month, but on several days when we had gale force winds and rain, it was gorgeous weather just 15 minutes south in Kaanapali. Every day, the weather was better elsewhere no matter where we went on Maui. There seems to be a vortex of especially lousy weather at the Ritz pool; even when the weather was fine 1/4 of a mile away, there was wind and clouds over the pool with people covering themselves with towels for warmth! I began to wonder if Kapalua meant cloudy in Hawaiian! I overheard several golfers who were in love with Kapalua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s courses, so if golf is your thing stay here. Otherwise, either the weather or the lack of recreational facilities for both kids and adults will disappoint you. We spent a lot of time in our car, getting away from Kapalua weather. Non golfers and those with kids should save the gas, stay in Kaanapali or Wailea.", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "The-Martinez-Bunch", "ReviewID": "UR6447422", "Content": "After spending months researching on the web we finally selected Kapalua Villas because it had some very nice pictures on the website.

The place was clean comfortable and had everthing a chef could want. The next week we had friends so booked a 2 bdrm condo through Sullivan properties as the ridge was full paid $270 a night was not as nice as the first condo but wow was the view from the BAY Villas worth the move, and the space we had to move around was great. I would highly recommend both companies. Sullivan actually mailed me the key before we left home, was a nice treat to go straight to the condo. The ridge you had to check in then they meet you at the condo- but they were cheaper and nicer rooms., But not as good view and far from the pool. P.S. The shuttle will take you anywhere in the resort for free, free WI FI internet at both, you may use the Ritz pool for free we never paid the $15 other people said they paid. Restaurants We loved Vino, Pineapple Grill, Sansei-great sushi, Roys and David Pauls. Safeway is good but Stars market had more variety and just as good of food sales.

It is slightly pushed back and the ocean view is limited by two other villas on each side. I was too tired the night of check-in to argue, but when I woke up I resolved the issue at the front desk with no problem at all. I expressed that I would prefer an ocean front over high quality furnishings. I was allowed to borrow the keys to a couple of other villas. Ladies, I did this before my boyfriend woke up because frankly I don't think he would have had the patience for my pickiness. I did, however, find the perfect vacation spot - building 21 - G5. It is a two-story, one bedroom, two bathroom, villa. It was a deluxe not gold villa (which is a downgrade) but I found it much more beautiful than our gold. Nice furniture, granite tops, ocean views from living room and bedroom, W/D, full kitchen. Stairs leading to beach directly in front of villa. One drawback - no AC downstairs, but the AC in the bedroom upstairs is fully functional. We kept the patio door downstairs open the whole time because of the constant fresh breezes.

I am very sad the management has let the resort rundown to this level. An open letter to the General Manager.

The kitchen aplliances are fairly new so I didn't mind using them and also their kitchenware (I'm very particular when it comes to using someone else's silverware). I love their spacious, clean bathroom. My favorite part of this unit is the lanai....we had a great view of the ocean and we are within walking distance to the beach, which isn't crowded at all. I would definitely stay here again! Please note, when I booked the room through Orbitz, I had booked a 1 bedroom ocean view. I was initially assigned to the Gold Villa which has some view of the ocean but nothing compared to the Bay Villas. The Bay Villas was an upgrade (extra 100 day) but it was well worth it. One tip, call the Kapalua office before you leave for your trip and request this room so they can have it in their system before you arrive. They of course, cannot guarantee that you get the room that you ask for but they will try to find you a similar one (I inquired about unit 21 G4 but got Unit 22 G4 which are similar). Another unit that came highly recommended in tripadvisor is unit 21 G4. Also, as mentioned in some of the reviews, beware of the Ridge Villas. The Ridge Villas are far away from the ocean so if you are looking for units that are \"walk to the beach\" the Bay Villas is the place for you. Restaurant reviews: We went to Fish and Poi, which is located in Napili Bay area on our first night. The food was delicious and moderately priced. I highly recommend their pan seared ahi tuna with wasabi sauce dish. Their mix drinks (luv the mango martini) are yummy. David Paul's in Lahaina is excellent for fine dining. My husband and I ordered their \"A Taste of Chef Selections\" where each person got a sampling of their 3 famous appetizer, 3 intermezze, 3 dinner and 3 dessert samples.

Our original plans had been \"accidentally\" cancelled so our agency scrambled to get us into the Kapalua Bay Villas. I was pleasantly surprised by our experience with the front office, concierge, and all other support staff. Artcharlynn (Art Charlynn) was an exceptional example of what the front office can be to a traveler. Tom, in concierge was professional with a warmth and kid glove service.Excellent service. We stayed in two different Villas. 12G4 and 15B4. Each was beautiful (12G4 was completely remodeled and has lawn access from the deck) but I preferred the view and other amenities (sand chairs, coolers, a library of books to read, Hawaiian music CD's, a new Boise system - added a wonderful touch, and no stairs to climb) in 15B4. One review I read questioned staying at the Kapalua Bay Villas because the Kapalua Bay Hotel (next door) is being demolished. We were half a football field away and didn't hear a sound. The Bay Villas are closer to the ocean (for convenient walks down to tide-pools or Oneloa Beach) and worth every penny. Due to the obvious freight expense that all mainland supplies carry I suggest taking a few items with you. Example: A soft cooler, sandwich bags, and large storage bags. We used these things daily. Everything else was furnished: as much tide and dishwashing soap as we needed, plus when something went wrong (the ice machine broke) the maintenance department came right away. We suggest you experience the pineapple plantation tour - Your guide, Joe, is terrific and we received pineapples to take home. The cultural program at the Ritz-Carlton is wonderful (We made tuberose, carnation, and orchid Leis and traditional bark and raffia bracelets. The film \"And Then There Were None\" is a must see.)

We called the front desk, and we were told there were no other options, so we opted to stay on the Murphy bed in our friends condo (how 's this for your 35th wedding anniversary?). We had to call back to our travel agent and spend extensive time on the phone over several days with the front desk to get three of the four days reimbursed.

The housecleaners did not speak English well, so it was difficult to have our towel requests understood. Further, there was a different set of housekeepers each day. Our condo was not well-equipped for cooking. Make sure you bring your own salt and pepper as well as measuring cups.

At the Kapalua resort, there are some good restaurants including the Pineapple Grill, which is a very good Asian-Hawaiian restaurant. There is so much to do in Maui that you don't spend that much time in the villa, but the time spent there is enjoyable. Another thing is that if you don't feel like eating out, the pools have Weber Grills and with supermarkets nearby, dining in is always an option. The Kapalua resort has a shuttle that will pick you up at your villa and take you anywhere inside the resort. This was nice since parking can be hard to find at the Ritz.

Kapalua Villas was one of the few hotels that was still available at the last minute. We thought it was the same hotel as the one we stayed before (Kapalua Bay hotel... I think it's converted into a condo), so we picked this one. We didn't get there til almost 10PM. Because we thought it was Kapalua Bay hotel, we got lost finding the hotel. We called the reception, and the lady \"Summer\" pleasantly helped us find the reception area. We still hadn't eaten dinner, and Summer helped us once again to get a call-in menus from restaurants around the area. The actual villas were a little further than the reception area, and you have to get there by driving. After the check-in, we once again got lost to find the actually villa! To get to the area, we had to go through this \"scary road\" - just trees, no light, and it looked like we were driving on the cliff (which we found out next morning it was just a golf course...). We were too scared to go and get lost in the woods (that's what it looked like...), so we once again called Summer to make sure... and it was the road we needed to take. It only lasted about a minute until we saw the villas (Golf Villas). When we entered our unit, we all just said \"woooooooooowwwww!!!!!!\" Since we were expecting a small hotel room, it was a nice surprise to see a place with kitchen, living room, dining area, and a separate bedroom. We actually called back Summer about twice to make sure that we had a right hotel, and the right price. It just looked too nice for what we paid for. My favorite was the bathroom in the master bedroom. The bathroom had the tub and shower separate, and the tub was very deep. Even though it was almost midnight, I had to take a nice bath. Next morning, we woke up and got to see the surrounding area in the light. There was a big balcony surrounding the living room and bedroom, and a great ocean view ahead of us. We all had a breakfast in the balcony. The check-out was at 11AM, and we were still far from Kapalua, so we called the reception to see if we can check out a little later. Although they told us that there will be a reservation for that day, they gave us some more time until the check out. The only regret we had was that we were always on the go, and didn't stay in the room as much. We now know where to go next time we go to Maui!

The plan was to spend two nights at the Villas and then two nights in Wailea at the Four Seasons. I have a separate review pending of the Four Seasons as soon as I can get the time to catch up on the reviews.... We checked in on a Thursday at the Villas Reception which is a small red building that looks like a converted former house (complete with sliding glass door as an entrance) earlier than the normal check in time. We knew that going in and still wanted to do the preliminary check in so that we could drop off our bag and head out for lunch (we had rented a Jeep Wrangler with a soft top and only wanted to carry smaller bags with us until the full check in was ready). The staff was accommodating and pleasant, we were told we would be upgraded on the spot to a two bedroom ocean view Ridge Villa which was a great surprise. Needless to say we were happy as we went to lunch. After lunch up at the Plantation Course clubhouse (which was very good especially with a small table near the open window looking out over the 18th green toward the ocean) we went to get some dinner at the local Napili market to have at the Villa before returning at 3.10 pm (we were told to return after 3 pm) to get our Villa keys. At this point things started to go sour. We had been bumped from the original 2 bedroom ocean view into a two bedroom fairway view Ridge Villa. My wife was a little unhappy but I was still ok with it seeing as how I didn't expect to be in one of the Ridge units and it was still a two bedroom. So we took the keys and our bag and went to the Villa for a look around. It was nice, certainly better than my view back home. Considering I paid for a fairway view unit, anything better would have been well appreciated, but this was just fine. We left for about an hour to scout the Ritz Carlton and the beach for the next day's plans. Upon returning, we noticed a car parked in the spot designated for our unit. The people in the car were just leaving as we pulled in and as we went upstairs we noticed our keys no longer worked. So I got back in the Jeep and returned to the Villa Reception building to see if they could re-program the keys. It turned out that after they had moved us to the 2 bedroom fairway view Villa, they (within that short period of time after we had left to look around) had given our unit to someone else. So, naturally that other party went into the unit, saw our things already in there and were also on their way back to the Reception area to straighten things out. With me also returning immediately, we were all there in the reception area together -- while I recognized them as they were leaving the parking spot, I'm not sure they had recognized me. As the staff was dealing with the other party, I simply asked for another staff member to reprogram the keys so that we could get into our unit, which they did. I drove back to the unit, and my wife was already back in the unit because they had sent security to find out why someone was in a unit already given to the other party. We had to explain to them that they put us in the unit first. After seeing what they had done, we were finally left alone at which point my wife and I went back to the deck to relax with a couple of beers and some snacks. No sooner did we sit down than we noticed ants. On the table, on the rail, on the porch. Further examination also showed them on the counter in the kitchen in a couple of spots we hadn't looked when we first got into the unit. By this time we were pretty fed up. My wife called and asked to talk to the Manager at the Reception area, by the name of Gin (or \"Jin\" maybe, not positive on the spelling) and this is where the redemption started. After acknowledging the mistakes and our concerns with all of the issues including perfect strangers being in our Villa and the ants, Gin asked if she could call us right back. Upon her call back, she moved us into a 1 bedroom ocean view Ridge unit (which was perfectly fine with us) with a magnificent view of Molokai straight ahead and Lanai to the left and a great spot for catching the sunset which by then was rapidly approaching. The unit was in the # 21 group (can't remember if it was #2115 or 2116 but it was on the ground floor) and it was clean, neat, perfect in size for us and well kept. Best of all we could walk right out the sliding glass door, sit on the lanai and watch the sunsets in peace (no ants). On top of that we received a $100 gift certificate on the spot for dinner or lunch at the Pineapple Grill on the Kapalua property. We used it the second night and dinner was very good. What started out as a disaster was recovered by Gin. If you are going to be checking in anytime soon there I would suggest trying to go directly to her. The rest of the staff was pleasant to us as well, but being moved around like we were (and having two parties assigned to the same unit) raises questions about whether one person knows what the other person is doing. It may be best just to cut through that and go to the manager. PROS: 1. Organized, concerted effort by the Manager to \"save\" this experience from disaster. 2. Quiet (at least where we ended up) location with great views. 3. Clean, modern unit. CONS: 1. The intial disorganization and run around. I doubt many people would be as patient with them as we had been but then we only flew over that morning from another island where we were staying with family. Taking a nonstop flight into Kahului from the mainland may have put us in a different frame of mind when all of these mistakes came up. Shouldn't their internal room management system prevent these kinds of things? 2. Kapalua Bay beach overcrowding. Very good snorkeling here especially along the left hand side rocks when you are standing on the beach. Clear, not much swell, good fish variety and even an ulua or honu will make an appearance. But if you wait past 10 am to get there, be ready to walk a little to get an open spot and to have to walk or swim back to the left hand side rocks as that is the first part of the beach that fills up (closest to the parking lot). It's not a big beach, but if you want to snorkel you will need to go here versus the Ritz beach. That's mostly a sandbar-type beach and a good place for boogie boarding and also a bigger beach. All in all, based on the recovery made by Gin I would consider staying here again if I could be sure that caliber of Management response would take place in case the frontline personnel or systems couldn't get it coordinated (in other words if I could be assured of dealing with her).

It offered a commanding view of the ocean, Molokai, both the Bay and Plantation golf courses, and the west Maui mountains. We saw incredible sunrises from bed every morning. This specific unit was 2-story with a lanai outside both the living (lower) and bedroom (upper level). It had updated furniture and a newer, well equipped kitchen. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The only real weakness was the bathroom... while serviceable it was not updated (25+ years old I think) and would have benefited from new fixtures and better lighting. Also, there was no A/C, but strong trade winds kept the unit relatively cool. Oneloa Bay was a minute's walk from our front door. Beautiful to look at and nice to stroll, but IMO not a good snorkeling or swimming beach thanks to wind and surf conditions. It was only a short 7 minute walk to Kapalua Bay, where the sunning, swimming and snorkeling is fabulous. Several other great snorkeling beaches were nearby as well. A very nice swimming pool was just a 100 or so feet away. With several wonderful restaurants on the property, plus Kaanapali and Lahaina only a 15 minute drive away, there are countless dining (and shopping) alternatives. One last comment on the Villas: I agree with other reviews regarding the variability of the units, and highly recommend you perform a good deal of research before selecting a unit. If money is not a big deal, next time I would rent from Kapalua Realty and reserve a unit from their \"Gold Program\" (Google \"Kapalua Gold\" for more info). There was one next door to us that I got to tour, and it was first class.

Kids have space to run around or hang out on the porch 4)Service was friendly - they say housekeeping is twice a week but they change towels everyday and if we put all our dishes in the washer they run it for us everyday! 5)Our drive to these great places take less than 2 minutes: the beautiful Kapalua beach, the exclusinve pools and beach in Ritz Carlton, Napili beach (very nice and full of people if you get a little lonely in the secluded villas), the serene Kapalua bay Hotel 6)All phone calls are free incuding long-distance Here are a few reality checks: 1) The king bed was not as comfortable as those in upscale hotels (e.g.,regular hotel blanket rather than plush comforters) 2)The pool in the property is small - we just use the pools at Ritz 3)It is more secluded so if you like to see a lot of people and make friends with other travelers this might not be your kinda of place Overall we thought this was a wonderful vacation spot for us.

They are on the golf courses. Enjoyed the golf. You get a nice discount on green fees for staying there. There was daily maid service and they even gave you 2 boxes of Tide detergent for laundry daily. It was very nice to have the washer and dryer. We had 2 lanais in our villa.

The Bay Hotel pool, while slightly less spectacular than the Ritz, had a wonderful ocean front setting and ambiance that made it our favorite. The golf package made golf reasonably affordable. While they messed up the layout of our previous favorite, The Village Course, when they added the new practice/lesson facility, (it now has a par three as hole number one and a par three as hole number 18!) golf here is still fabulous. (Even considering they had just aerated the greens of the Bay Course). 4 hour rounds (except for a weekend round on The Plantation Course) and great staff made golf very enjoyable. The location, while at the far end of Maui is supurb. Don't stay here if you want night life and lots of excitement. Stay here if you want great accomodations, great food and great golf.

Kapalua villas are grouped into golf, ridge and bay villas. The ridge units are on a ridge and every unit has an awesome ocean view and a large balcony. Our unit was very nicely renovated, with granite kitchen and bathrooms. Our 1 bedroom, 2 bath unit was about 1200 sq ft, roughly the size of the first floor of our home, and even has a washer and dryer! They provided everything, including laundry and dishwasher detergents. This condo truly is as convenient as a fully equipped home. We booked through Costco travel. I must say that there are probably a few units that are not as well maintained as each unit is individually owned and maintained. But you can always ask for a different unit if you're not happy. Be advised that you pay $10/day resort fee which includes parking, shuttle service, and most importantly, FREE long distance phone use pretty much anywhere in the world. That's right, we called relatives in China and the Philippines and talked as long as we wanted to. For those who love Japanese food, the famous Sansei Japanese restaurant is a 5 to 10 minute walk from the ridge villas. The best Japanese food I've had is still at Nobu Matsuhisa's original restaurant, Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, but Sansei comes close, for less money. We also tried Plantation restaurant, which has a great view but the food was not as inspiring. The restaurant at the Kapalua Bay Hotel, Gardenia Court, served mediocre food. We went on a snorkel trip on the Four Winds II, to the Molokini crator, which is billed as a must-see for snorkeling. I feel it's way overrated. Even if you don't get sea sick on the 1 hr 15 min trip, the variety of fish and coral is underwhelming. I had a better experience snorkeling around Black Rock in Kaanapali, which is free. You just park at the Whaler Village, walk up to the beach next to the Sheraton, and snorkel around the Black Rock. It was amazing, as good as anything I've seen in Kauai and the Big Island. I even swam next to a big turtle, which can usually be found if you venture a bit to the deeper waters. Let's see. My wife and her mom went to the Luau at the Marriot, and thought that it was the most entertaining luau she has seen (we've been to 2 others on the other Hawaiian islands). In summary, I highly recommend the beautiful, spacious ridge villas, which have ocean views to die for. The weather in Kapalua was supposed to be in the high 80's when we were there, but it felt 10 degrees cooler because of the constant breeze. Very pleasant. The wind was never too strong.

We had an attempted break in the first night there. Nothing was taken than GOD! Security came but were not competent. No one called the next day to see if we were alright. There was no airconditioning in the master bedroom. They never fixed it, as it was the wrong voltage for the wiring. Mind you they knew 6 months prior that we would be staying at the Villas and we wanted a newly rennovated, King Size, Ocean Front Room with airconditioning and paid in advance. The unit we received as I said had no airconditioning in the master bedroom, the rennovations were cheap home depot rennovations. They had bugs and salomandars.

We did book through a travel agency but they used the Kapalua Villas main office to make all the arrangements. The unit was great, with spectacular views of Kapalua Bay while overlooking the golf course. The only negative was that the refrigerator broke down after our second night. We called, but a repair person didn't come out until the next day. We did have ice cream melt and some of our food spoiled but management did give us a credit when we checked out. Hey, those things happen. The unit was very well stocked, as previously described by others. A toaster oven would have made a good addition but we got by with all the other appliances. The only bug we encountered inside was a dead roach in one closet. There were many cute birds that visited us every day on our spacious lanai and lots of small lizards running around outside. Maid service was nice but they only did a thorough job of housecleaning every third day. It was an extremely spacious two bedroom unit, with a really nice twin shower in the master bedroom. Lots of closet space in both bedrooms. The sleeper sofa was really not that good but most of them usually aren't. Since only one of our children used it, he found that it was actually better to leave the sofa unopened since the sofa itself was very long and was quite comfortable as a single bed. There are several pools around the complex and we did use one of the gas grills provided at the pool nearest to our unit. It was really clean. It was another pleasant plus. Pools at the Ritz and Kapalua Bay are nice but were a bit crowded. Snorkeling off of Kapalua Bay is great. Just rent equipment from one of the local companies which are close by or through either hotel, but check out rates first and what quality of mask is provided. Oh, the Kapalua Villas also provide a free (just tip the poor driver) shuttle to any of the other hotels, door to door. That's also a big plus. Staying at the Villas provided the best of all worlds for a family. The money we saved on meals that we prepared while in our unit allowed us to go to better places to eat when we did eat out.

Kapalua is a beautful, somewhat isolated area on the northern part of Maui and is very lush - lots of pine trees, grass, and hills. The Kapalua Villas appealed to us because we were getting a pretty large living area, 2 bedrooms and the ability to cook whenever we didnt feel like going to a restaurant. However, since the Ritz Carlton (a five minute drive or 10 minute walk within the Kapalua resort area) allows the guests of the Ridge/Kapalua Villas to use their pool and recreational facilities without a charge, we felt like we were getting many of the benefits of staying at a luxury resort while getting the value of a condo. The unit itself was pretty nice, although it could probably use a bit of a facelift some time soon (kitchen was a bit dated). Everything was very clean and worked fine upon arrival. We sprang for a unit with a/c, which we would recommend not so much for the heat, but because it is a humid area and the a/c helped to make things a bit more pleasant. By the way, the a/c is not a central unit. Each bedroom had a window unit which cooled down the bedrooms, but didnt do much for the living room. The unit was spacious and we never felt confined or cramped during the 2 weeks. The view from our unit was magnificent - facing the ocean from a hill which was about a quarter mile from the shore. We had a very large balcony outside the living room and another two small balconies outside the bedrooms. The management company that rented to us, Ridge Realty, was very professional and helped us with our requests prior to and during the stay - they got us into the type of unit we wanted even though we were staying at a busy time, and they ensured that everything was delivered as promised. I have heard that their units are better than the units managed by other realty agents in the area. The area itself is nice, although anyone staying should be aware that this part of the island is windier and a bit cloudier than the more touristy areas - Kaanapali and Wailea (the weather at times disappointed us, but at other times, we were actually happy to have a constant breeze cooling us down at the pool). On a positive note, the area is quieter and less congested than the more popular areas on the island, so there is a tradeoff to balance. Also, Kapalua is about as far north as you can get, which means it is further from the main airport and some of the major sights such as Haleakala, Hana Hwy, Upcountry area than Wailea or Kaanapali. This didnt bother us much but may be a factor for those who want to be near the popular sights. Those considering the Kapalua Villas should be aware that housekeeping service is sometimes extra extra depending on who you rent from. I believe some other rental agencies include a once a week service, but we paid $95 per cleaning.

We booked our trip thru Classic Custom Vacations, who were a great asset throughout the trip, and insured that we were able to get the \"best villa\" available. We called in advance, and received a great two bedroom fairway villa within the Kapaula Golf Villas (Unit 12-P2), which was on the 10th fairway of the Bay Course at Kapalua, and the whole family absolutely loved it! I was concerned about the \"bug stories\", and the lack of an \"Ocean View\" villa going in, but had no problems with either, as the Fairway villa did, in fact, have an Ocean view, and our vacation was \"bug free\". My wife and I have three kids (15,13,9), and the two bedroom villa was the perfect alternative to our previous 2004 stay (wife and I alone) at the Kapalua Bay Hotel. Guests at the Villa have full use of the facilities at both the Kapaua Bay Hotel and Ritz Carlton Hotels, and we used both extensively. The Kapalua Bay Hotel has the best \"snorkel beach\" around, along with a great pool, while the Ritz offers a great series of \"waterfall pools\" , with a \"sandy beach alternative\" to the \"snorkel, coral beach\" of Kapaula Bay. We also had a \"semi-private\" pool adjacent to our Villa, so we truly had the best of all worlds. Golfers have to stay here (I played twice, but could have played a lot more). \"Villas\" offer the best family meal alternativeas well, so you can choose to eat any specific breakfast, lunch or dinner meal with the full kitchen, when you get tired of spending $80-$100 per meal during an extended stay here (ours was 8 days). The money you save makes the Villa the best cost alternative around. When we did go out for dinner, the \"Pineapple Grill\" (a short walk out the back door of our Villa) and Vino's (Italian Tapas and Wine Bar) at the Village Course were excellent choices for us. Kapalua is a short 15-20 minute ride to the Kannapali and Lahina \"strips\", but offer a much \"quieter, get-away\" alternative to the \"commercial hotels\" at either location.

You also look at two lava flows extending into the sea with waves crashing over them.

The nearby Ritz Hotel is beautiful and welcoming and always has something interesting going on. This is a great place for those who want more of the real Hawaii, more interesting weather, great beaches, and less of the crowd. It's at the end of the road Maui (almost).

The golf courses were great (too bad the planation course was closed). On the downside, we were so disappointed in our villa. Very dated, mold in the shower, musty smell and wall to wall carpets that were not very clean. The front desk did their best to find us something more appropriate. After seeing 5 other unit, we settled on an ocean front unit (no smell, no carpets). The unit was much better but still could use an upgrade in the bathroom. Of course, the view was the best part. I think people who are thinking of booking at Kapalua, must realize that the units are 30+ years old and indepentently own and the owners are not obliged to renovate. This is what we were told from the person at the front desk. So if you go, you must ask for a renovated unit. As for the rest of the Kapalua area - it is very pretty, peaceful and the beaches nice and the restaurants very good.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Summerland, BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cKapalua Was Awesome\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3296895", "Content": "I recently won a trip anywhere in the world I wanted to go.

That trip as I said was for anywhere in the world I wanted to go and I really think that for what we like to do I picked the best. Now I just have to win a lottery because it was a bit expensive.

Kapalua was the family favorite. We found it as beautiful as Wailea (tho Wailea had more tropical plants) and much quieter than Kihei. We should note that we were there over Valentines and President's Day weekend - so Kihei was esp. busy and traffic on the island was at times very backed up. Our Ridge Villa was peaceful, private and well kept. We loved the atmosphere at the resort. It never felt touristy or overly busy tho it looked like the Ritz and the Villas were fully booked. Because of the size of the resort, you never felt limited to just one building, hotel or pool and could choose according to your mood that day. Our young teenage kids prefered this atmosphere over busy Kihei. They used the shuttle to go to the beach, the Ritz pool and the Honolua Store. They loved the snorkeling at Kapalua Bay and the drive \"Over the Top' of the island. After I read the reviews I was somewhat worried about Kapalua's 'remoteness' and the stories about bugs. We loved it. Napili and Kaanapali are 5- 15 min. away and that drive was much more relaxing and usually faster than driving from our Kihei condo to the Kihei Safeway! (Take your Costco and Safeway cards with you ! ) Perhaps it was the convertible that made driving so enjoyable? Bugs, thankfully, were non existent in our villa. The Ridge is not ocean front but has beautiful views of the ocean with lovely greenery in front. We toured the Bay Villas as well and found them to be less private (lots of windows and close together - but more exclusive.) They are oceanfront but not beachfront. Our Villa had it's own BBQ which we really appreciated, many other complexes in Maui have shared BBQ areas. There were also public BBQ's at the Villa pools, along with a small library. The Ridge units are large compared to the other Maui condos we saw. Our 1 bedroom was 1300+ (incl. the lanai.) The main bedroom was large as was the ensuite. Our unit had air conditioning and we used it a few times. Ask the rental company for an updated unit if this is important to you. We were told that some rental companies grade units and only accept those in A and A+ condition into their rental pools. THe rental companies offer charging privileges at the hotels and stores as well as golfing packages. Private rentals will cost less and not include some of these extras. Depends on what you prefer/require. Either way ask lots of questions and be specific about your needs. Weather was fine when we were at there - preferred the changing Kapalua weather to constant sun on the south side. We found evenings cool on both sides of the island. Wind was an issue on both sides as well - but we were told that an unusually windy front moved thru that week. One possible downside at Kapalua: Who to call with general questions eg. how do we register for the pineapple plantation tour, closest internet cafe (Napili Market) or Ritz (high rates - business/adult not teenager geared). Found the rental agency quite helpful. Quick notes: Honolua store: handy and reasonably priced, small deck outdoors for eating. Catholic church right next door to store - standing room only on the Sunday we went. Sansei at Kapalua Bay Hotel has 50% off on Thurs. and Fri nights after 10:00pm if your passion is sushi. New development happening here in 2006 - Kapalua Bay hotel is being demolished and new owner/membership type facility is going in. Rental prices expected by some to increase in this area as it becomes more exclusive. Car is required. On maps Honolua store looks like a short walk from the Ridge across one of the golf holes, however a ravine and fence make direct crossing pretty much impossible. If I was doing the Hana drive from Kapalua vs. southside - I might choose to spend a night in Hana depending on how many stops and sights were on my itinerary.

This unit had a beautiful view however not much privacy since it was a lower level unit. We asked the staff at the rental office if we could switch to another unit and they were very accomidating. They moved us (the staff moved our luggage and fridge items for us) into a beautiful two-level 1 bedroom condo that was absolutely AWESOME. The number of the unit is 22-B3. Very nicely appointed, remodeled kitchen and gorgeous views. We took full advantage of being able to use the facilities at both the Kapalua Bay Hotel and Ritz Carlton. The Bay Hotel has the most beautiful grounds and we had a blast snorkling with the sea turtles. As far as the bug stories go, we only came across one rather large roach in the condo however quickly relocated him outside. This was the only bug encounter we had while we were there.

Having read the reviews on this site I was very concerned about what we were going to find once we checked in but we were pleasantly surprised to get a fantastic villa in The Ridge development. I had booked 'ocean view' and expected to get maybe a glimpse of the ocean but our villa had the most amazing ocean views on three sides. We requested air conditioning but was told there were no units available with ac until the following day. However, it wasn't necessary in the end as the properties are built with adequate ventilation and once you open all the louvered panels in the rooms the tradewinds just keep flowing through. I spoke with one of the realty staff about the bad reviews I had read and he explained that as each villa is privately owned the conditions can vary. He also explained that the the Kapalua Villas rental facility now 'grade' each property either A or A- and will not rent out properties that fall below those grades. So my guess is if you rent through an independant rental agent you may be getting a property that the resort rental people have rejected. The golf courses were fantastic and being able to use the facilities at both the Ritz Carlton and Bay Hotel were an added bonus. We also used the resort pool, which was within walking distance of our villa, and had it pretty much to ourselves. It is a much quieter resort than those in the Kanapaali area and families with children may prefer a livlier environment. My only complaint would be the 'laid back' attitude of the staff when we checked out - I stood for at least 5 minutes with 8 staff behind the desk either chatting among themselves or staring at their computer screens, all ignoring me completely, even when I asked if someone could help me they all stopped, looked at me, and then went back to what they were doing !!", "Date": "September 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eureka Springs, AR", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, Can't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2477797", "Content": "I just returned home today from a 7 night stay at the Villas. We stayed at the Bay Villas and had an oceanview that was amazing. The room was very large and nicely decorated. The kitchen was really handy to have your snaks, if you don't want to eat out the kitchen is great. The bathroom was my favorite part of the room it was huge! The entire wall was mirrors and it had two separate sinks so it was easy for us to both get ready at the same time. Most of the rooms have no air conditioning. I did not feel it was necessary b/c of the breeze. If you get hot easily request a unit with air. Having a rental car is a must, there are very few things in walking distance. I recommend going to the Honolua Store for snacks and beer, it is much cheaper than the grocery store and they have breakfast and sandwiches. The golf courses are beautiful and very challenging (mostly b/c of the wind). I did not mind the wind at all I thought it was wonderful, you can lay on the beach all day and not feel hot. You will have to walk to the beach, the water around the villas is mostly surrounded by lava rock, but at most it is a 5 min. walk (depending on which beach you use). The villas do offer shutteling services free of charge. The most practical beach is at the Kapalua Bay Hotel (5 min walk) it is great for snorkeling and is less windy. If you are a surfer I recommend the beach inbetween the the villas and the Ritz, great waves, but more wind there. You can use the neighboring hotels services, but be careful of the Ritz, they will charge you for everything, including use of there fitness center and a $30 charge for unreturned towels. We had the breakfast buffet there one morning, the view was good and so was the food but it was $54 for two buffets. I really didn't think things were as expensive as I thought they would be. My meals ranged from $12 -30 per person and that was for steak and seafood. Eating is part of a vacation so splurge, it was worth it.

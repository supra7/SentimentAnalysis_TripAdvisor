This was my first stay in this hotel, but not my first stay in Las Vegas. The price was right for our four night stay. I read several reviews stating issue with smokey rooms. I did not find that to be the case in our room. I loved the spaciousness of the rooms and the bathroom was very nice with a seperate vanity and sink outside of the bathroom. Was able to do my primping while my fiance showered and used the vanity in the bathroom. The one item that I was not crazy about was the shower head and the spray, but just a matter of preference. The hotel is off of the strip, but they do provide a free shuttle. It is within walking distance of the Palms Hotel and next door to the Gold Coast hotel. The table limits are cheaper at the Gold Coast (found a $3 min roulette table). The pool area was nice but if you are not out there by 10-11a then the chairs are few and far between. This should be no surprise as is the case with most hotel pools.

Check in staff was awesome, friendly and gave us a room with the view of the Palms. we checked in quickly, rode the elevator to our floor, walked a few hundred thousand miles (lol) to our suite. Smelled clean as soon as we opened the door. The bed was fluffy, checked under the sheets and mattress to see if there were any unwelcome guests, luckily none were found. Their was a separate vanity area with a sink, which my hubby was happy I had my own space and he had his own sink and space in the the bathroom. There was a fridge and a coffee pot, I think the coffee pods were 4 bucks a pop so we declined. There was also a fully stocked fridge under the TV in the stand that had beer and liquor, which we did try some, but the ones we took were never re-stocked. Housekeeping was good. There was a small etched window to the shower from the wall by the bed. That was funny and different. We tried to watch the show in the sky on a Thursday, but it never did start, we had drinks while we waited for a couple hours. The short entertainment we did see was the cocktail servers on the floor would get on this scary small stage and either sing or dance. The outfits were really skimpy and kind of outdated. I played video poker while the hubby played cards. He didn't have much luck there and played for about 4 hours. He said the pit boss was always going over to this native guy and giving him a hard time when the white guys were starting everything. Poor guy, got the short end of the stick. The guy was saying, I'm just trying to play poker and these guys don't want me here. Anyways, hubby didn't like the the unfairness, so he quit playing. We took the free shuttle to Harrah's/Bally's and would walk the strip during the day. When we would get back the Rio casino would be lound and crowded. Seemed to be a popular place at night although it was off the strip. The ATM's were out of service a lot of the times. Bartenders were attentive and always asking if I needed another drink. Dim Sum was the bet restaurant to eat at. The others were okay, but a little dry for me. Oh Yah, the Italian place was also wonderful. Yummy food. Tried Truffle fries for the first time. :) After playing many hours and spending a lot of money, at the end of the stay, the comps weren't that good.

I was grossed out right away when we entered the lobby to check in - so smokey it was nauseating. I realize that all Vegas hotels have the smokey casinos right in the lobby to lure the gamblers in, but this hotel must have a really sub-par air exchange system, since it was the smokiest one we encountered out of many hotels we visited in Vegas. Got up to the room - and here were the two good points - the room was nice & big - space for a desk & 2 chairs, a couch and coffee table, 2 big beds. Also, the view over the strip was really pretty. Okay, back to the bad points. The windows wouldn't open, and even though we were on the 20th floor, the smell of smoke was constantly drifting up from the casino - often cigar smoke, which is the worst of all. Not possible to make coffee in your room unless you spring for the K-cups, which cost $8 for 3...so you have to trek down to the smokey lobby to get coffee and breakfast from Starbuck's. Noise level in the rooms was okay - had noisy partiers next door one night, but after that it was fine. Also, almost every restaurant in the hotel opened off the smokey lobby with no dividing doors, so they were also filled with smoke. The hotel was supposed to have a \"Rio de Janeiro\" theme, but it was pretty lackluster. The free show wasn't even on when it was supposed to be, so that was also a letdown. Overall, this hotel was a big letdown. It was obvious that they cared more about getting people to gamble than about the health and happiness levels of their guests. Don't stay here, try another place, like the Paris Hotel (classy, not too smokey and right in the middle of the strip).

Since we were there for business, it was tough to have much time for running off to the strip and that's when you realize how much is lacking around you. No shops, very few restaurant choices, not enough tables. There is a shuttle that will take you to either Bally's or Harrahs on the strip, so if you're there for pleasure, there's no need to walk to the strip. However, even with the limite slection, we never had a shortage of where to have drinks. The Voodoo Lounge is a very fun place to wind down. The iBar (or circle bar - as we deemed it) offers a great place to have a mellow drink. One of the most beautiful cocktail waitresses I saw (Jackie) worked there. Make sure you stop in and say hello. She's a sweetheart. It's random, but while in the casino you'll notice that waitresses and waiters will jump up on stages throughout the casino and dance and/or sing.

I have stayed at The Rio 4 times while in Vegas. There are very cute waitresses and fun bartenders everythere throughout the property. The checkin has always run smoothly. The casino seems to always have something going on . Singers, Chippendale strippers signing autographs, etc. etc. From The the Show in the Sky to the Sexy Voodoo Beach, this place is fun! The I-Bar located right at front doors has awesome martini's and beautiful women in thongs serving them up to you! It can be hit or miss with the crowd. For dining options we have tried several. First the famous Village Seafood buffet. WOW!! From cut up lobster to prime rib its amazing. Be starving when you arrive! Its pricey at around $39 but its worth every penny. The World Buffet is very good as well and there are numerous coupons for it. The All American Bar and Grille is ok, nothing great, a bit pricey I feel for what we got. Then there is Cafe Martoranos.....Very pricey Italian food, but it is fantastic. The meatballs are to die for!! And the veal !! Perfecto!! But my favorite restaurant is the Voodoo Steakhouse. Located 50 floors up with fantastic views, its over the top outstanding. The bayou seafood platter appetizer is awesome. The scallops, the Tomahawk Ribeye, the dry aged NY...Its all well prepared but can be very pricey . Plan on $100-120 PP minimum with wine. After dinner at the steakhouse head up the staircase to dance the night away at Rio's Voodoo Rooftop Nightclub. The views are amazing. You can sneak up there for sunset as well and its well worth it. If you want to save money on drinks buy a witch doctor! They cost about $30 and you drink one or two of those and your night is set!! There are plenty of VIP seats and this place is generally fairly lax on the seatting issues. If your early enough you can find places inside to set down without bottle service, which is an exception for most of the popular nightlife spots. The Rio's sportsbook is just average, while the casino floor is full of energy! I love the dealers and staff at the Rio! Very friendly , nice, and fun!! Also to get to Vegas strip you can drive,take a cab, walk (17-18 minutes) or take the free shuttle which comes about every 30 minutes .

They advertise that every room is a \"suite\". I would say that is an extremely loose interpretation of that word. They are around 20%larger than that of the average Las Vegas hotel rooms, though. I loved the view of the north strip from the Masquerade Tower and have a killer video of the lights coming on on the strip. The pool area is awesome, but the water is frigid in the cooler months. Really nice areas to \"sleep it off\" by the pool if you choose to do so. There are some decent food choices here, also without breaking the piggy bank. Walk to Gold Coast for some decent gambling... there is none to be found at the Rio or Palms. The Penn and Teller show is a great one...must see it if you're staying there.(go to goldstar.com for best deal) Rooms in both towers are now showing their age. It is a far cry from the nice new Hyatts or Marriotts that many of you frequent. However, if you normally prefer the Holiday Inn for your travels, you will be ecstatic about your room, food choice, etc at this property. The thing we liked best about the Rio is how accessible it is with a rental car. It is a great base of operations for our Vegas trips. It's two blocks west of the center of the strip...just a few blocks away from Orleans, Palms, Ceasars, Mirage, Bally's, Paris, Gold Coast, etc..., and is also right on Flamingo where the ACE bus runs and there are tons of locals businesses and bars that can help enhance you Vegas experience. You can normally get pretty good pricing through the marketing dpt, and if you get the right price, it's one of the best hotel values out there. There is also VooDoo Lounge on the top floor... if you've never been, go. The Carnival World buffet is good on a BOGO - do not pay full price... the seafood buffet is still the best in Vegas but is significantly less impressive as it was a few years ago.

They do have an excellent pool area which includes a sand beach, but it was way to cold this time to visit. The room I stayed in was in the Masquerade tower (the tall tower), and it looked like it had been recently renovated. It was nice: comfortable king bed, nice sectional sofa, a minibar in the main room and then a mini-fridge for my use near the bathroom. The television was circa the late 1990s, but I really didn't go to Vegas to watch TV in my room, so no bother. The Rio also provided an in-room safe (which is nice to have in Vegas). The bathroom was very well lit with two sinks and new granite countertops. Check-in on a Wednesday night took me 30-45 minutes, and that was around 9:00pm. Around midnight there was still a line, so beware of this. The rooms in the Rio have floor-to-ceiling windows. This can be great if you like a view of the mountains or the Strip. It can be bad if you're overlooking a parking garage or air conditioning units. Fortunately I was high enough where I got a mixed view of Strip, mountains, and air conditioning units! The casino is really big and you can lose your money here just as well as anywhere else. Gaming minimums were around $10 on the weeknights and went up on the weekend. Plenty of tables and tons of slots. The Rio also has two of the better buffets with their Carnival and seafood buffets. Huge selection and good quality all around. There are also a number of other restaurants and bars for any budget. It's pretty self-contained here so you'd never have to leave. You can walk to the Strip from here, but it's about 15 minutes on sidewalks that are on major roadways. You can also take the free shuttle, but that runs once every 30 minutes and can fill up quickly. Last thing, they have a \"new\" Irish pub that I was looking to try. Found out that it's only open on Fridays and Saturdays. When we went on Friday night we looked at the taps to see that they were out of Bass and Harp.

The Rio has large floors, so I recommend asking for a room near the elevators, but far away enough that isn't a high traffic area. Room attendants were very courteous and the room was always clean. The free shuttle to the strip is convenient though they fill up on the return depending on the time of day you go.The only issue we had was that our key cards timed out after 3AM, two nights in a row. Not what you hope for after a night out and it is a long walk from the Masquerade Tower to the front desk.

Beds are comfortable ,the ac system works well ,shades and curtins keep the sun out well. tv and mini fridge ad to the room as well. Hairdryer,iron,mirrors,and safe are all in the bath area closet with clothes hanger and luggage rack. We liked the large open space here and always came back to a clean fresh room at days end. The hotel --- This large 2 building property has two parking garage spaces that make it easy to get into the hotel unlike most of the mega resorts on the strip. Inside the hotel its like mardi grass a new orleans feel with a full blown show in sky complete with floats suspended from the cieling music and dance (mostly adult orientated) I would not advise to bring small children here or vegas all together for that matter. Everyone likes to get the free necklace they through from the floats (just wave your hands). The bar tenders put on a juggling show from time to time. Entertainment -- The rio has of course casino and showrooms at our visit pen and teller in one room and chipendales in another. There are two nightclubs here one on the top of the building voodoo lounge and the other on the main floor. IN the masquarade village ther is a two story shopping arcade with some 15 stores to go through. Food-- I think the hotel has a very good selection of on site choices to eat. there are two buffets including an all seafood one. The world buffet is one the best in town. (see other review) A deli , seafood restuarant.an italian restaurant,some bars,and a quick bagel stand or two. pool-- We stopped in for a peak but is was closed during our stay. All i can say is it looks nice even has a beach. Service -- Everyone we encounter was helpful , every request we made was met. overall -- I liked this place because it gives you best of both worlds it has all the excitement you could want, then has a peace and quiet away from the strip also.

Unfortunately, they do not provide any coffee pots (like all the other Las Vegas casino hotels - this gets you down into the casino faster). Oddly enough, I kept hearing the Ipanema Tower had been recently remodeled. But our room still had an old, squishy couch and an old 37\" tube TV. I guess I have just come to expect flat screen TV's in decent hotels. The shower spray was good, but the tub would not drain. Finally, the checkout procedure at the front desk was ridiculous. We would have checked out via the TV system, but we found a bunch of overbilling errors. That gave us the 'opportunity' to stand in the checkout line for over 40 minutes. There were only 3 people ahead of us, too. For some reason, the hotel knows that people are going to be checking out between 11am and 3pm, yet they only had one person behind the desk processing checkouts. You could tell that this poor girl was stressed out, and it turned out to be her day off, too. She corrected our bill, but it took over an hour. By the time we were done, the line behind us has grown to 15-20 people. At the pace they were moving, we projected that she had at least 9 hours of work.

However, we couldn't get a room with a \"proper\" refrigerator. All rooms have a fridge, but none have a freezing compartment which we needed for medical purposes.

We were on the brink of moving out when one of the security staff who was trying to help in this situation, suggested getting a real fridge form the Cabana area of the Hotel.

Unfortunately on our last visit we we troubled to find some disturbing things happening there. First of all the property is beginning to need some investment from Harrah's. We've always accepted that the property is older and shows some age but has always been very clean & well maintained and we overlooked some of the signs of age, \"character marks\", because of the quality of the experience the staff gave us. Check in was easy & quick, as Total Rewards Members they always take great care of us. A couple of minor maintenance issues, the deadbolt on the door would inadvertently lock when we closed the door as we left the room, requiring maintenance to come up and let us back in our room. Maintenance had to come up to let us in our room immediately after we checked in. We started manually holding in the deadbolt as the door closed behind us and this solved the problem. Additionally, the AC in our room was not operating and our room was borderline hot, luckily the weather wasnt hot yet but the room was still uncomfortably warm. The biggest issue we encountered was criminal activity in the Masquerade Casino Friday & Saturday evenings/early AM's as the Crown Nightclub was emptying. This club seems to cater to the locals and I think the management has inadvertently attracted a local criminal element. We saw drug deals being done in the casino and I overheard gang/criminal discussions along with drug usage in the restroom. Management has put added security in the area knowing that there are issues but seems ineffective in dealing with the problems. My wife was not comfortable in this part of the casino either Friday or Saturday nights. All that being said, we still love the staff at the property and feel a little guilty posting a negative review about the Rio, but thought it was necessary information to pass along.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abbotsford B.C.

The room was large (600\u2019) with two queen beds, full sofa, coffee table, 32\u201dTV, and writing desk. Beds were very comfortable and room was quiet. There was a separate area with a closet, safe, sink, refrigerator, and large counter space. A door from there opened to a smaller room that contained a full size tub, shower, toilet and another sink. The shower was strong and drained quickly. The only negative was the hot water in the shower lasted just a couple minutes. When first turned on it was very hot and needed to be turned down, but soon turned cool. The deals available on the RIO web site made it a great bargain, and there were NO resort or any mandatory fees. If you had been to this hotel several years ago you may recall a small window in the wall of the shower so a lady could peer into the main room while showering. Of course being a gentleman, one would never peer back. Those windows are long gone. Gambling was OK, and we were able to play quite a bit without losing the kids college funds. While gambling on the machines, drinks were offered often and the time between ordering/receiving was only 3 or 4 minutes. Alas those poor young ladies who deliver the drinks must not be paid well because none of them seemed able to afford many clothes. Again, being a gentleman, one could not stare. With one exception everyone in the hotel was outstanding. The one exception was a security guard sitting at his station in the casino.

Had a non-smoking suite, but cigarette smell periodically comes blowing through the vents. OH, and I can't forget the bugs. Something bit me and I was referred to SECURITY to handle the bug problem... (for real... security).

I endured listening to the street traffic ALLLL night long, along with the train, and it didn't matter that I was very high up. The windows are NOT sound proof.

We'd have to go through the claims department but only after spending 20 minutes with security taking a statement and taking a photo (that not even the claims department could see clearly enough). Then, after waiting two weeks, we found out that the claims department was still investigating and wasn't sure, based on the photo, if what we had claimed were true, that the ink from the shirt had bled into 4-5 spots. My friend had dry cleaned it to avoid this in the first place. It was a $100 shirt, and after dropping a lot of money at the casino, he's still waiting to be reimbursed after 2 weeks.

It was my first time in Vegas and was attending a conference and decided to stay a few extra days. HINT: Make sure you get a Total Rewards Card even if you don't gamble as there are lots of coupons and discounts in all the Ceaser Entertainment resorts. Check-In: The only really poor experience was check-in. It was slow (5 people at the front desk and only 2 taking customers) and then the clerk I got somehow forgot how to smile -- she was very grumpy and not a great first impression of the hotel. Other than that I was very pleased. Room and Parking: I was on 12th floor and room was big, clean and beds were great. I was in the smaller tower facing the Gold Coast casino. The thing that suprised me the most was how quiet it was. I didn't hear people in the other rooms, doors banging, traffic, people in hallway (and no I wasn't drinking!). And I am very easily annoyed by these things so I was very happy. Lots of drawer space and hangers, closet space, the separate vanity area with a sink is good. I'll try and post a picture of the hotel room shortly. Lots of self-parking available. HINT: Park on the 4th floor of the Masquerade Parkade and you have the overpass to the casino. Food: I was very much looking forward to the Seafood Buffet but on day 2 I went to Carnival Buffet and was pleased. They had mounds of snowcrab and shrimp and many other fish entrees. Not to mention Italian, Mexican, Carving Stations, etc. etc. etc. HINT: Go to the 1/2 price ticket booths on the strip and for $2 you can get 25% off which is cheaper than just using your total rewards card. The I went and looked at the Seafood Buffet and honestly don't feel that it is worth the extra $10 so I never went. The Carnival buffet lines start to get long at around 5:00 pm so if you want to go in and out fast -- go early. I never really saw the line at the Seafood one get anywhere near as long as the Carnival. The Deli by the sports bar has farily decent and inexpensive burgers (much cheaper than room service). The Voodoo Steakhouse was very good as well. MAKE SURE you spend some time out on the balcony as it's on the 50th floor and the view is amazing. Rest of the time I ate out or at the conference (which had surprisingly good food). ANOTHER HINT: You can bring your own instant coffee (eg. I brought some Tim Horton's French Vanilla Cappacino with me) and use the machine to make the hot water (or you can make tea same way). Its a lot cheaper than buying the K-cups or Starbucks. Only problem is the sink is alllllll they way on the other side of the room so that can be annoying if you want to make several cups. MORE HINTS: DO NOT taking anything out of the bar fridge to take a look at it. The items that are taking out are tracked by a one way barcode scanner (only on the way out, not on the way in) so even if you take something out and then replace it, you will still be charged. Other reviewers seem to be upset that there is no flat screen TV but not sure why. The TV's worked great, although there are limited number of channels (so if you're planning to be in your room watching TV or are looking to watch your favorite TV series, you will be disappointed. Entertainment/Casino: Went to see Penn and Teller. Again, purchased my tickets at the 1/2 price booth the day of. They said it was for mezzanine or balcony only but when I got my tickets at the box office I ended up in the 7th row front and centre. They fill up the orchestra section first so they don't have to open up the other sections. HINT: Pick-up your tickets from the box office earlier in the day so you don't have to wait in any big line-ups and you wll get better seats. Drinks at the shows were more expensive and a bottle of water was $2 so unless you absolulety can't go without a drink for 2 hours, wait till you get out to the Casino. HINT: Penn and Teller run out of the theater after their show NOT to get away, but to position themselves in the hallway as you exit so you can come up and speak with them and take pictures. They will stay as long as people are there so that's great fan appreciation. Class act guys! The show in the sky was good. If you don't get any beads (or don't want to hope you get one), they have free pictures with a couple of the performers and will give you beads when you get it taken. ANOTHER HINT: If you're in the casino for more than 1 show, stay by the bar (near the BK end) and get a prime spot to watch the flair bartender who performs after the show in the sky. The \"bar dancers\" were kinda cheesy but the drink service was extremely fast and efficient. The waiters was always friendly. One takes your drink order on a tablet and then someone else brings it to you within 5 minutes. The slots were tight (at least for me) for most of the trip until the last night when I won all my money back. Sat by someone who won $4500 on Keno machine and saw lots of people hit the 1000 coins on the Wheel of Fortune game. They only have two 25 cent Progressive Wheel slots and they were often taken so that was a bit of a bummer (but the jackpot didn't go while I was there so I guess that saved me some money!). All in all I thought the resort was great. I only paid $420 for 6 nights (taxes included) with an additional $50 for internet. Internet was not wireless but I only worked at the desk so it was no problem. It was very fast and no issues with connections or service. I would have liked to have used the gym but I would not pay $17 a day for that priviledge. Shopping and Transportation: Eventhough I had a car, I still took the shuttle to the strip one evening so I didn't have to contend with the traffic and parking. The shuttle was fast and efficient and it's easier to catch the one to Bally's rather than Harrah's (and they are only two blocks away from each other). Not a great selection of shops but they had all the required spandex and sequence that seems to be a pre-requisite in Vegas! Too bad I'm a little too old and a little to large to fit into it (although that didn't seem to stop others -- tee hee). Sorry for being long winded but hope that you get some value in the review.

Called that morning before flight to arrive between 7-8pm ( yes we have it) NO WE CANT HOLD A RESERVATION ! Moved the next day at 5pm to what was reserved.--Thanks Charles---------- So the machines are tight-Tight-Tight- Even on Friday the 13th Tight. Try one at a time -get some back- 2x and 3x NO GO ! If you want a free drink ? 3 min-- is really 10 min. Save the dollar tip and get one for $5. at thed bar-- You can loose a $20 just for waiting. REALLY ? Have some fun !!! My guy was Bummed about the poker tables so costly -- He sat and watched TV in the room .GO do stuff January 2012 -not a great time. Think I'll try again with the Indians !!!! OH !! If your up for the walk -- Take the shuttle to Harras and walk the 5+ miles to the Golden Nugget. Lots of veiw just by walking to call it a REAL tri[p ! Stop and grab a Cigar ! Then save $30 for your taxi back to the RIO !!!", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Big Rooms\u201d", "Author": "Marcasso", "ReviewID": "UR123372152", "Content": "I met the family in Las Vegas for a nephew's wedding.

I was given a room in the Masquerade tower (which I assume is the older one) on the 31st floor. The view faced the pool and had a reasonable nice view of the northern part of the strip. What I found odd was the mini bar and big block of a television were place smack dab in the middle of the window. It really blocked a potentially very nice view. The room was clean and housekeeping did a nice job during my stay. The room was vacuumed daily and of course the the bed was remade and the bathroom cleaned daily. I honestly didn't spend all the much time in the room. Daylight I was at a convention and the evenings were taken up with shows and dinners. Except for changing clothes and sleeping I was gone. I found the room just fine for that, especially at the price. The other tower might be a better choice for the next trip due to the Voodoo lounge being right below the tower and the thumping bass of the music might bother some of the lighter sleepers. The staff is outstanding. I never felt any indifference from anyone. I dided at the Sao Paulo for breakfast several times. My food was always made as I had ordered and arrived quickly. The barkeeps at the main bar were great about keeping the glasses full and the ash trays clean as well as offering the occasional (when asked) tip on the video poker games. I found the valet parking to be no different that any other hotel on the strip and better than a couple I used (Caesers comes to mind in the poor category). The attendants took the car off my hands quickly and the pick up was just as efficient. It was always first come first served and always an offer of directions or help by the staff.

Bell desk was prompt in getting luggage to and from room and valet parking was fairly quick. The parking garage that was most convenient to hotel is off of Valley View Drive. Otherwise, if you enter and go right, you hit the Masquerade garage which puts you into the Masquerade area. They now do a burlesque show- six male and female dancers plus some really good male and female singers who sing to canned music, four or five times a night. Best viewing is from one of the second floor curved balconies opp. the stage. Most importantly, as the Rio lets the world know, there is no 'resort fee' which at other hotels can easily be $15 a day. So, this makes for a good value and you are on Flamingo, near the Palms and Goldcoast plus near the 1-15 on ramps to take you further north or south on the strip....The coffee machine in the room is a Kerug.

We did not try any of the other restaurants in the hotel, however, next door at Gold Coast, is the TGI Fridays. Rio offered shuttle service to the strip from early morning until 1am.

We stayed there earlier in the year for my daughter's birthday. Unfortunately, I was hospitalized immediately preceding our check-in and required a disabled guest room. They were more than accommodating for the exception of their staff refusing to provide me with a wheelchair escort to my room. No, they only offered wheelchairs for rent which meant we had to pay for the wheelchair for our entire stay. The room was beautiful and very large. However, the day we were to check out, my toddler son woke up with what appeared to be bites all over his baby body. Initially thinking they were bed bug bites, we called Security to check it out and file a report. In the mean time, we gave my son another bath (the first bath being the night before check out) to try to calm the spreading marks all over him. By the time Security arrived to our room, the marks were spreading very quickly. We rushed to check out and take him to the doctor as these red marks were now very rapidly spreading. It was very scary to watch. Security seemed unconcerned. He was diagnosed with a viral infection that he must've contracted from the bath tub in the hotel room and only further aggravated the situation when we gave him the second bath. I heard from their Risk Management department some time later, who also seemed unconcerned. I expressed my worry that this would happen to someone else who tried to use the bathtubs and even sent the attached pictures to them, but their stance did not change. They were only focused on whether or not I would be pursuing legal recourse. Ridiculous!! So as local honeymooners in las vegas and management in this industry, we had our pick of hotels to utilize for our honeymoon. We decided to stay with the Rio again, because the room was so beautiful when we stayed with them before. Boy did we pick the wrong place!! In my wedding dress and high heels, my mother and I were waiting in line to check in Christmas evening and I found a shawl that someone lost on the floor. I picked it up and when we approached the front desk, I turned it into the clerk \"Gena\" who was checking us in. She in turn, tries to send me across the casino to Security in my wedding gown to turn it in to them. I refused of course and told her I was here to check in and was only turning the shawl into an employee as a good Samaritan. \"Gena\" clearly didn't want to do her job, as she initiated our interaction with just waving us over from the line, no introduction, no greeting, no smile. From there on out, \"Gena's\" interaction only went downhill. When she asked for my credit card for incidentals, I was informed of a $100 per night hold that would be put on my credit card = total $400 hold. I told her that was unacceptable and she said that because I had a debit/credit card that's the policy. So why isn't this disclosed at the time of reservation? She was willing to reduce the amount of holding, but that was still unacceptable in my eyes. I believe she was being discriminatory because of the previous interaction. My mother provided her credit card (no debit option at all) and no \"hold\" was placed on her credit card at all. The clerk just beside her was exceptional with his customer service skills. He exuded personality and meeting the needs of the guests he was checking in. It was disappointing having to deal with \"Gena\" as my check in clerk, but watch him next to us doing everything correctly. I asked \"Gena\" for the Front Desk Manager's card as I had a feeling this would not be the end of it and it wasn't. My husband and I drove my mother back home and when we returned to the Rio with our luggage, we walked into a totally different world than what we stayed in previously. The room was extremely run down, wall paper peeling off the walls, extremely small, dated decor. Motel 6 would've been more prepared for our honeymoon than what this place was. Because we disclosed we were on our honeymoon at the time of the reservations, they promised us an upgrade with a view. We got a view alright, of the next tower over. I called the hotel manager and asked they he change our room. He put us in a room that was even worse than the first one. The second room had wall paper peeling off, stains on the couch and the vinyl layer on the desk was peeling off! Same horrible decor. This time when we called down to the front desk manager, we asked for a disable guest room. We switched towers and finally put into a descent room. This entire process took hours and we did not finally get to sleep after our long day until late at night. In the meantime, we desperately needed to get out of our formal attire. The Front desk manager, while accommodated our requests was less than excited to hear from us and seemed completely detached. Customer service trash! The next morning, we woke up to what we thought were gun shots going off in the room. There was a window washer banging around on the window for hours! Never received notification from the front desk staff that this would be going on, so it was quite alarming. I'm sure the window washer got the peek of his dreams while I was walking around naked in my room trying to find clothes to put on. It finally stopped for a while and we were grateful, but when it started up again a while later, we had enough! We called down and spoke with a new front desk manager. Instead of hearing us out, he just wanted to talk over me and throw comps our way, (this by the way, is the same treatment we got from everyone at the front desk). Why they don't understand the concept of just treating the customers right the first time and you won't have to give out comps to make the problems (the customers) go away, I don't know. The comps are nice, but really not required. Just fair treatment from the staff from the get-go is all we expect. Nevertheless, we were assured the window washers wouldn't be waking us up anymore. The room service had descent food, for the exception of the hair on my orange juice glass. We enjoyed it. The employees that we came in contact with were just as disappointed in the establishment as we were. The second day, housekeeping tried to enter our room and that's when we found out that we were marked as already vacant, when we were staying for four days and certainly hadn't checked out. They suggested we call the front desk manager (AGAIN!) to straighten this matter out. Indeed, they had us as checked out and didn't even have us registered to the correct room. They still had us registered to the first crappy room they tried to put us in. Unbelievable! Once again, talking down to me and my husband and throwing comps around. New room keys were to be brought up to our room, but were never delivered. Our room keys continued to work, so we carried about our business. Third day, keys didn't work. Had to wait in line at the front desk late at night for new keys. Got tired of waiting so I called the front desk manager again as we waited. This time it was yet another new manager. He tried to give us the run around again and as I spoke to him on the phone, he told me they couldn't give us new keys to OUR room!! I asked that he come out to speak to me. He said he didn't realize I was waiting in line and he thought we were calling from our room. How can I be calling from my room if I'm in line to get new keys because I can't get in my room??!! Secondly, caller ID!!! When he came out front, he must've gotten a case of amnesia, because suddenly he was unfamiliar with whom he was speaking to and with what type of activity there was on our account. So, he made us wait a while longer while he went into the back to check our account AGAIN and then finally provided new keys to us after bantering with us. What is so difficult about giving us keys for the room we've stayed in for three nights already? Oh that's right; they STILL had us registered to the first room! Amazing. Honestly, we won't even get into the disastrous bar & grill meal experience or the safe assist experience where we were suddenly locked out of our own safe too! Why isn't there a cafe on this property? Lastly, the cocktail waitress outfits were nothing less of OFFENSIVE! They trotted around in black sheer lace that only slightly covered their breasts and thin strip of the same material around their bottoms. The only thing under the sheer lace was a black thong. How is this supposed to make the women feel who are visiting the Rio property, especially with their new husbands?! If we wanted to be in the atmosphere of a strip club, we would've booked our room at one. We tried to lodge a formal complaint while we were there, but alas, no one would take our complaint. Tried to do it on the website, but it was not user friendly, it was next to impossible. It would've been nice to do it directly from the internet in our room, but jokes on us, you have to pay for internet. Oh yeah, and coffee! There is no complimentary coffee in the rooms, you even have to pay for that. There really should be more accessible parking as well. Every time we wanted to go somewhere, it was a hike just to get back to our car. Couldn't valet because it was always a mess getting through the Porte Cochere. No traffic control at all and no one out there telling the vehicles to keep moving.

The RIO runs a frequent shuttle bus to the HARRAH or BALLYS hotel on the strip (every 15 mins) therefore there is no need to worry that it isnt on the strip & in any event it is only a 15 minute walk to the BALLY and 20 mins to HARRAH which are centre strip if you prefer to walk. The hotel offers a full extensive range of eating establishments bars gambling areas & shows as do almost all Vegas hotels but nevertheless the RIO is as good as any for little cost & importantly there is no significant resort fee to surprise you at the end of your stay at The RIO as it is 1 of a handful of hotels that are against this concept & rightly so.

The Service was great from the time we stepped onto the property. The registration desk was well staffed so there was not a long line up. We booked a room that was a perfect size for the 4 of us - would have been nice if we were able to get an upgrade. Great Things: 1. Free shuttle to downtown 2. Great room size 3. Customer service 4. Lots of Games and Definitely recommend getting the rewards card 5. Cute shops on site that were not over priced and good variety 6. Clubs were great and so was the entertainment 7. Awesome slushy drinks (the ones with the long tube and alcohol - cheap refills at a bunch of locations) Downside: 1. Price at the restaurants were high breakfast for 4 was $90 we had the average continental breakfast. 2. Some Cabs varied in price to get to the strip 3. Price for the room at the Hotel at that time was very expensive $$$$600 plus 4. We couldn't see the fireworks unless you went upstairs to the Voodoo bar but tickets were really expensive. 5. The pillows and bed were ok - not the fluffy ones that you would see at the higher end chains. We booked through Allegiant Air and got great deals on shows, Must see the Blue Man Group.

Our first night, we were unable to get the room with a strip view, as reserved. So, for one night we were put on a lower floor of the Masquerade Tower. It was clean, but it was ugly. It reminded me of a larger version of the old Binnions rooms..very bad, outdated, large holes in the carpet, burned places in the bathroom counter, window view of industrial equipment..bad. Next night we were moved to the Ipanema Tower, and it was like a different world: wonderful view, updated, larger room, and a comfy bed. In no way elegant, but at least up to a spacious Holiday Inn type room. Unlike other posters, I did not find the casino smoky. But there was obviously a profession being practiced. I sat near the elevator playing slots, and the same skimpily dressed women would go upstairs with a guy, then return, and a bit later go up with a different guy, on and on. Even my husband noticed this going on, and he was sitting at the table games. It was not very subtle, and hotel employees did nothing to stop these activities. In a dozen Vegas trips over the years, I've never seen this so blatantly exhibited. Also, the dancers on the tables, and the show in the air with barely dressed dancers was a bit much. The music was way too loud for my tastes. Because of this, there seemed a coarseness at the Rio that I never noticed in my former stays. As to the internet availability, at least in early December it was available free at the Starbucks. That was really convenient. As to the slots, they were not terrible, but I saw no big winners. At check-in, there was a long line, and not enough clerks, but staff were polite and helpful. I did overhear a loud argument in another line, where a guest was upset about not getting the smoking room he had reserved. Our clerk commented that the Rio had decided to only have one smoking floor, so, this sort of disappointment, at check-in, by smoking guests was common. We had Sunday brunch at the buffet, and though a little pricey, was very tasty. On the whole, the value was good, staff helpful, but the coarseness, and the chance I could end up in the Masquerade tower again will likely keep me from going back.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cocoa Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "happytraveler32172", "ReviewID": "UR122379545", "Content": "Loved this hotel!

The pet-friendly room had an odd window from the bathtub/shower to the bedroom so that when the light was on it went directly into the bedroom. Very strange. Rio advertised that the pet would be given a treat, and a food/water bowl. Our room came with neither. The waiver that was required for a pet stay was unbelievable. It was about 10 (yes, ten) pages long. We had just checked out of a hotel in Scottsdale and there was no waiver at all to sign. The pet area was a very long walk from the room to the elevator to the main level of the casino, out the back door and by the pool.

Very comfortable bed, nice linens. 180 degree view of Vegas was very cool. One cheesy pod style coffee pot with 1 reg and 1 decaf pod - another call to housekeeping to bring more coffee.

Yes, I'm actually writing this review from my room in the Ipanema tower on the Rio's questionably slow internet connection (more on that later). Before I even start, let me give you one tip if you do stay at the Rio: make *sure* you get a room in the Ipanema tower-- this is the renovated tower where the rooms are fresh and clean. Once (yes, just once) I made the mistake of not requesting this tower and I felt like the elevator was really a time machine that took me back to 1963 (the room was smokey and so out-of-date that it looks like it'd fit in better downtown). Let's make this easy: The pros: *Cheap. The Rio has *great* deals, particularly if you go through their website or Kayak (Kayak is a fab way to compare all the sales and offers in one handy place). Sign up for the Rio email list and you'll get good deals. I think this time I'm paying $30 or something. *Clean. Even the old tower is clean enough, it's just sorely out of date. The new rooms though? Well, despite the giant, thick, old school tvs (this stands out in Vegas where every hotel-- even the cheapy ones-- has flat screens), the rooms are modern, comfortable, and very clean. *Friendly. The staff is definitely friendly. The front desk staff is always cheerful and seemingly pretty genuine (which I think we all know isn't exactly the status quo in the hotel industry--- not that I can blame them). *Room service. The room service selection is pretty delicious, quick, and the servers are friendly enough. You're still paying room service Vegas prices, but nothing exorbitant. And now, the cons: *Check in times. Good LORD. Since I'm in town so frequently, I get that these hotels can get awfully busy-- really, I do. But one Sunday (so, not even a Friday night) I waited over an *hour* at check in here. I asked the agent if that's normal and he sighed, saying, \"Yeah, it gets real bad on Sundays. If you come back again, I suggest coming later in the evening on a Sunday to check in.\" Ever since then, I've taken his advice and it's been fine, but definitely beware. *Did I mention the other tower's rooms? Someone else described them as \"the rooms that time forgot\" and that seems pretty on point. *The non front desk service. My room this go around has a non functioning tv (which is not terribly surprising, given that the TV appears to be about a decade old). When I turn the thing on, it's on channel 62 and the remote wont change it. In fact, the actual tv itself has no \"channel\" button (it's broken off). I called house keeping (per the phone menu's directions) and they said they'd report it to maintenance. It's now been almost two hours. Since I've called, I've ordered, received, eaten, and put away my room service dinner. I just called again, asking if they plan to come (since I want to go to bed soon) and the woman snapped at me to, \"Give it a few minutes-- sometimes it takes 30 minutes.\" I explained it's been two hours and she said, \"Fine. I'll call them again. Thank you.\" And yeah. My TV still isn't working. *The internet. The TV wouldn't be so bad if I could stream videos or something on the internet (like any modern internet connection would allow), but their internet connection is incredibly, painfully slow. We're talking 5+ minutes to load a low quality, 10 minute Youtube video. It's not just crappy wifi, either-- I'm actually connected to their wired line! To top it off, this isn't free internet (which, even if terrible I'd soldier through because- hey! It's free!)-- no no, this slow thing costs $14 a day! Just for fun (since I have no other entertainment in the room), I ran an internet speed test. At the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, NV, $14 a day gets you a blazingly fast .77 mbps download speed. *The Valet. So, most people don't realize that just about every valet in the city of Las Vegas is free. Really! Just be sure to tip. That said, the valet here at the Rio is perhaps the most disorganized I've ever seen-- they have such an odd way of stacking the cars that you usually end up waiting an eternity just to drop your car off. I know what you're thinking: \"What the heck is wrong with you? You got screaming deal for the hotel room, what did you expect to happen?\" Here's the thing: in Vegas, rooms are a dime a dozen. Good rooms. Cheap rooms. Nice rooms. I've stayed everywhere from the Plaza (never, ever again) to a penthouse at the Cosmopolitan (free upgrade. . please, please again) and the one thing these places have in common is that they are all screamin' deals. Ask any Vegas regular and they'll tell you that here, cheap doesn't necessarily mean low quality (and that's a GREAT thing for most travelers). So, my hope is that somebody at the Rio reads this and works on these short comings. This actually is a nice, off strip property, but the failings are definitely starting to outweigh the positives. By the way: it's now been 30 more minutes and no one has come to fix the TV.

The room was large - and as other reviews have said - more like an oversized hotel room and not a true \"suite\". But did I care? Not really. My room was immediately off of the elevator and there was NOT any noise the entire time. If anything, it was super convenient! Room tour: Everything was clean. Was the carpet a little warn, sure. Was the curtains/decor something I would have in my own house, no. Had the sofa seen better days, you bet. Do I really care?? Not really. Other reviews said that there was a coffee pot in the room. I had a fridge, but no coffee. I promptly called Housekeeping to bring up a couple of extra pillows and extra hangers - the 4 in the closet are never enough.. She arrived quicky with 2 extra pillows and about 15 hangers - score! She definately got a tip! I would have slept good the first night except for 2 things.

In fact it is the only place where we bought gifts while in Vegas for 4 days. We went in primarily for just a World Series of Poker baseball cap ($19.99). We ended up buying a $42.00 betty boop handbag, 4 animal hats for the kids ($19.99 each) and 4 cigarette lighters ($7.99 each). And before we left town we went back and bought 4 coffee mugs and a shot glass before we left town. You don't test drive gifts like this you expect everything to fit and work properly. When we got home 2 weeks later and gave the lighters to our friends they didn't work. I called the Rio,. by the way finding a direct phone number to the hotel was difficult. I was past from one person to another, probably took 20 min. to 30 min. I told my story to everyone that answered and was transferred from reservation clerk to concierge, to property manager, to a manager that was supposed to be in charge of the gift shops. He asked me what would make me happy about this whole situation, I said lighters that work. He told me he would personally take care of this that same day. But after about an hour he called me back and told me that that particular gift shop is controlled by a subcontractor that leases the shop from the Rio. Oh Wow! Everything they sell has the Rio's name on it. It's in the Rio too. But I was assured that someone from that shop would call me. That was Nov 11th. Still haven't heard a thing from anyone at the Rio or the shop. I guess the saying, \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" is totally true. It's just 4 cigarette lighters to the Rio but it's $33.96 to me. And the friends that we got those gifts for think we brought them cheesey lighters they can't use. We could have bought them all a Bic lighter that works. Thought it would be a cool place to stay next time but no way now, they aren't getting another dime from me.

You don\u2019t have to wait in line 20 minutes to check in to a Motel 6. But since most Las Vegas places give you the unwelcome treatment, don\u2019t let that keep you from staying here. I stayed at the Rio to avoid Strip traffic, while visiting friends who live in the northwest part of town. Even around the Rio, traffic is miserable. Access is possible off Flamingo, but if you park in the garage east of the hotel, it\u2019s a long walk to the front desk, and good luck trying to find your way back to Flamingo when you leave. In daylight I found the parking garage on the west side of the hotel/casino. Even though I paid an online discounted rate, I had a great view of the Strip from the 11th floor. The curtains kept out the light, so I could sleep late. The bed was not the traditional \u201chard as a board\u201d found in most Las Vegas accommodations. It was actually comfortable, and so were the pillows. There were two sinks, a large tub with shower, and just one bar of soap. I think Motel 6 gives you two. There is also a coffee maker, but the premium ground coffee costs $8 in the minibar. I took it out to look at how much it weighed, figuring it was slightly more expensive than saffron. Maybe that\u2019s why the $8 charge showed up on my bill when I tried to do the video checkout. They must have scales, or surveillance cameras, in that minibar. No problem, it was just a 15-minute wait to check out at the front desk. I asked about one bar of soap. They said I could have had more if I had asked. Maybe the last guest came back to the room before I arrived, took some coffee and soap, and left the dirty washcloth draped over the shower curtain bar. Or maybe the housekeeper just missed it. There wasn\u2019t a shower mat, either. Maybe that\u2019s what the dirty washcloth is for. There are more elevators than in most large hotels, and they run frequently.

I stayed at the Rio for 4 nights Oct 20-24th. The room though still large, was missing the living room style chair, the couch looked like it was from the Salvation Army--we were so skeeved by it, we covered it with a sheet before sitting on it. I paid for a third person, but had to constantly ask for moret owels, toiletries, etc. Note- no one checked our passes when we went to the pool, so no need to pay out for additional people in your room, they sleep 4 anyway-why is it that we had to pay for a third person, an 18 yr old at that. I had the Wet 'n Wild plan...2 free drinks per person at the pool. What a fiasco---my sister was the other person- the bartender would not accept her hotel ID; I had to go to the front desk and work it out where there was a blank reservation. I must say that Walter / NY at the front desk was very customer focused, others at the front could not care less. Even with all that, I still got charged, I found out when I went to check on via the tv. So back down to the front desk ! I was there for a conference, and the conference center was great, good food, clean, well organized, so they get points for that. Overall, if you are looking for \"fancy\" don't come here. If you are looking for cheap ( though when I went it was almost $200/nt so check the price calendar before you book), not so crowded, the waitresses do come by with free drinks often---then the Rio is ok.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mustang, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value - Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "rporter8555", "ReviewID": "UR119954058", "Content": "We booked our room at the Rio through Southwest Airlines about 3 months ago and got a great price, could be before convention goers ran the prices up.

I had never been to Rio all my times to Vegas for work for pleasure and was interested in checking out the hotel. I knew it wasn't going to be good when I say fake flowers decorating the outside of the property. First, this is one of the smokiest casinos I have ever been in. And I have been in many of them in Las Vegas. My clothes and hair would reek by the time I got back to my room at the end of each day passing through the casino to the meeting rooms. Second my room... it wasn't a \"suite\". It was a large room that was nothing fancy. In fact, I don't think my room had been redecorated since the early 90s when the hotel was built. The room was not dirty, just worn and very outdated. I was paying a rate of $160 + tax / night for the room and there is NO WAY this room was worth $160 + tax / night. Maybe $80 + tax/ night. In fact one day, my room was never cleaned. See pictures below for what I mean by outdated. Third, the staff. Check was very efficient and the front desk lady was very nice and one of the poker dealers was really fun to talk to. Other than that, would give the rest of the staff a big ole F. Examples, I had to wait almost 15 min (there was no in front of me) for the concierge. She was on the phone the whole time. No one else was there and to be honest, she didn't know much about the property or y options for a private room at one of the \"resorts\" restaurants. The pool person. I walked down to the pool drinking a Diet Coke. The pool \"guard\" told me I could not take the Diet Coke into the pool. I was like why? I just opened it. She said I could not bring outside food into the pool. I was like really? She told me to throw it out. I had already paid $3 for a 12 oz bottle of diet coke so I just went back to my room to put it up there. When I went back to the pool the same pool guard was there and she demanded to search my bag. I was livid. How dare a 20 some year old want to look in my beach bag (all that was in there was a Nook, sunscreen, room key, and my phone). That whole scene left a really bad impression. And I could not see a sign posted that said no outside food. If it was there, it was small. The Rio was running a fundraiser where people could repeal down the side of the building... well that happened to be right in front of my room. I walked in, started to change and there was a person hanging in front of my window. Scared me to death. I called the front desk, spoke to the manager and asked why people were not given warning of this whose rooms would be affected and he had no answer. He then proceeded to tell me that at 8 am on Saturday morning they would be doing an opening ceremony on the roof (under my windows). I was like really? On a Saturday AM? He told me he would put a $30 credit towards breakfast... but it never happened. And the last example was the service we had at the seafood restaurant. It was decorated nicely and some of the food was OK, but the service was horrible. It took forever for our plates to be cleared, the server never came by to check on how everything was, and we would have to flag him down for additional drinks, etc. Forth, you are really removed from all the action of the strip. A cab ride to the closest CVS (by Aria) was $11 one way. I did not like being that far from the strip. Lets just say, if you are going to Vegas, I would stay far away from this place.

LOCATION: It's located off the strip next to the Gold Coast and down the street from the Palms. Depending on which casino you want to go to, it's a $7-$12 taxi ride to the strip. You don't want to walk, trust me. *My fare to the airport (20 min. ride) was $17, but there IS a shuttle service that costs $7, but you need to make reservations at least a few hours in advance, and the shuttle leaves 3 hours before your flight (40 min. - 50 min. ride). LOCATION RATING: 3.5/5. CASINO: Typical slots/video poker. I didn't play the machines very much because I know the chances of winning on slots is slim to none. The minimum on the table games was $10. If you don't feel like spending that much, go across the street to Gold Coast where the tables are $5 minimums (I won $100 on a craps table there). The staff at the casino was pleasant, and the men wore football jerseys on Sunday, which I thought was cool. I think once every hour, a dancer would get up on these mini stages around the casino and dance/sing for 5-10 minutes. At night, the Rio Sky Show in Masquerade Village is great! Lots of singing, dancing, and removal of clothing (not talking strip club style, but they got down to a corset and panties; and for you ladies, the men took their shirts off). CASINO RATING: 4.5/5. SHOWS: The only two shows that I was aware of was Penn & Teller and Chipendales...didn't attend either. Thus, no rating here. HOTEL ROOM: Even though the Rio advertises \"all suites,\" the room seemed fairly basic. Two beds, fridge, ironing board/iron, in room safe. The only things that made it stand out was a sofa and a booze/snacks fridge (which is really expensive, as expected) under the TV. The TV wasn't even flat screen. I was in the Stratosphere on my last trip to Vegas, and even it had a flat screen. Room was very clean and the halls were quiet. Housekeeping was very nice and met my needs. There was one thing that really stood out and that I find extremely odd, there is a small window between the shower and the room. It is a glass window with a design, but what's the point? So we can all be peeping toms? ROOM RATING: 4/5. POOL: I didn't get to use the pool, but it looked very nice. Though a bit smaller than I expected, there was a huge rock pile in the middle with multiple waterfalls. This rate is based on what I saw. POOL RATING: 3.5/5. FOOD CHOICES: I ate at McFaddens and one of the sports bars (don't remember the name, but the servers all wore referee shirts). McFaddens is an Irish Pub style restaurant with great food and good beer. They even had a beer pong tournament (new cups used every game). At the sports bar, I had a cajun chicken quesadilla, which was quite good. There are two different buffets. One is a Seafood Buffet and the other is your typical buffet. Didn't eat at either of them.

I was unhappy at check in, as I had requested a strip view which they said was not available. When I got to my suite on the 18th floor, I still had a strip view from both sides of the suite. The suites are a 180 degree view, so I could see from Mandalay Bay to the Cosmopolitan from the dining area, and from the bedroom I could see from the Stratosphere to Caesars.

The bed was extremely comfortable, the suite was clean and I was truly impressed. My only complaint about the suite is the showerhead. It is the worst shower I have ever been in.

With all the casinos, shows, restaurants, etc., we are usually only in our room upon waking up and going to bed! So, with that in mind, all that is really important is a clean, comfortable, quiet place to sleep. The Rio filled two of those three adequately especially considering the discounted rate we got via a \"connection\". These are not truly suites, as others have mentioned, but rather very large hotel rooms. It's more space than two people need, and would probably be a bit crowded with four. Bathroom is very small, and it's annoying to have a window in the shower which lets the bathroom light into the sleeping area if someone gets up before sunrise to take a shower! The dressing area with vanity, second sink, large closet and dresser area plus refrigerator is a bonus. There is also an in-room safe. I imagine desperate college kids could comfortably sleep ten to twelve people in this room utilizing sofa, bed, and floor space! The surface areas of the room were clean, but I don't think the housekeeping staff understands the concept of vacuuming around the edges or underneath anything. There is a gross collection of dust and dirt along the walls and large pieces of furniture, and a piece of paper from a prior guest lay crumpled under our bed for the entire stay. Several of the pillow cases were threadbare, and when I called to ask for four more pillows (I need to have my feet elevated for medical reasons), I was told they would only deliver two. This is an older hotel; I am sure it was lovely when new. Now it needs a freshening up. Lots of stains on the carpet, and walls need a fresh coat of paint. It didn't feel gross, however, and the bed was relatively comfortable. We were on the 23rd floor in the Masquerade Tower overlooking in the pool. It wasn't noisy, but it would have been if someone had been next door as there was an adjoining door. We asked to be in a quiet location at the end of the hall away from elevators and ice machines. Our room was next to both! Elevators are set back in, however, so it wasn't noisy. We did get music noise one night although I have no idea from where. The casino is very loud and smoky. There is poor communication between the casinos Total Rewards program and the hotel. We were told we'd get a discount on various things which did not materialize. More alarming was the fact that we were told we were already \"in the system\" because we had stayed at a sister hotel earlier this year which was absolutely not true! Consequently, they would not offer my husband any of the new enrollees perks as they said he already had a card (which he didn't). The Vodoo Restaurant on the top floor has a patio with an unequaled view. Make sure you go up there to see it! The prices are very high, and it reminded me of Ruth'sChris. Everything is ala carte. Waiter screwed up one order in our party, and there was nothing done to compensate us for having to wait another 20 minutes for the correct order to come up. I think they just reheated some of the food the rest of us had ordered that was ready on time. The steak, however, was very tasty. Three drinks, four appetizers, four entrees, and one shared dessert = $330 plus gratuity. For this kind of money, try Sinatra's. The good news was we didn't need to leave the hotel to go to dinner. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey, and we walked across the street to the Gold Coast for a fabulous breakfast buffet at half the price. There was also self-parking readily available in the lot across from the hotel for our rental car so no problem with that. Valet parking required waiting too long for the car to be delivered when we requested it so we just used the self-parking lot. We did not use the shuttle. Staff at the hotel was, for the most part, for friendly and pleasant. At one point one of our party walked by a casino drink server and asked for a water from her tray.

In fact, all nightclubs play their music lower than this. If I were working at the Rio I'd demand hearing tests. There is zero point thinking that you will be able to relax by the pools, even the one you have to pay at (but only if you are male. Go figure). Thats not to say the pools aren't very clean and that the food is actually very reasonably priced and of a high standard. But it is just too noisy. And then there are the guests - average age I guess about 25-30. Typically male. Typically very loud. I never ceased to be amazed why it was necessary for them to shout at the person next to them when just talking would have sufficed.... The hotel is also a bit regimented about searching bags to enter the pool area. You have to show your card to prove you are staying there - so why are you penalised for taking water etc. outside?! They force you to buy theirs outside (as opposed to that you have just bought inside!!!). Finally, in this day and age, can't wireless be free. It is a little petty to charge for something that is freely available in lots of other places inc. the Starbucks downstairs. One final note is that you have to stay in the Masquarade Tower.

I have stayed in hotels at triple the price and had suites that were decidedly less impressive. The major difference in the Rio was that I did not have a personal fax machine in the room. Otherwise, I much preferred the decor and space of the Rio. The Rio seems to have a special more vibrant ambiance that most of the other casino/hotels in Las Vegas. It is a bit hard to describe but suffice to say that there has been a nice attempt to capture the feeling of the city of Rio de Janeiro, a city I have visited several times in the past. There is constant entertainment wherever you go. I did not have a chance to use the pool or any of the other amenities of the hotel so I have no comment although they appeared to be excellent as well. The location is just off the Strip a slight disadvantage. However, there are shuttles every half hour to Harrah's as well as the Bally hotels on the Strip, Las Vegas Blvd. I have walked the distance and it appeared to be closer than it actually was, taking about 30 minutes to walk to the Flamingo hotel on the Strip. A taxi ride to the Flamingo takes about 5 minutes and costs about $9 including tip. The much lower price more than compensates for the geographic disadvantage.

But then I tried to use the fitness room this morning. They charge $22 per day to use it!! I've been to a lot of hotels, and I've never EVER been charged to use the fitness room. I got a manicure and massage at the spa. Although the spa itself is lovely, again, it is a rip off. $125 for a 50 minute massage (back home I get just as good a massage $85 for 60 minutes). Then, on top of THAT, the front desk girl told me there is an $18 surcharge, which is supposed to cover tip as well... but when I signed the bill, the surcharge was $22.50! Grrr....

It cost me $0 to stay instead of $13.95 (for wifi) for the night. I checked in on Saturday, October 1, 2011. Upon arriving via Gray Line Shuttle (another negative review I fear), I stood in a check-in line that sprawled throughout the lobby (well, from the front door). After 30 minutes of waiting, I got my room key card and made my way to the Ipanema Tower. Upon opening the door, I was greeted by a repetitive, make that incessant bassy 'thump' or 'thud' as you will. As I later suspected, it was reverberation from the pool area. I discovered this Sunday morning when I went down to see the 'beach/pool' area. While the pools and mini-beach are a very nice area, the fact that 1. this massive speaker system is playing this music (and I use that term music very loosely) and 2. the speaker / music are located in very close proximity to the kids' shallow pool area, seemed a bit odd. When I complained in passing to the young female pool attendant, she replied that a lot of people have said the same thing but that a 'few' people like the music. I made the same comment to the check-out person a few hours later (the t.v. check-out function was inoperable at the time and I had to stand in line for 20 minutes). She also told me that people complain about it and said that next time, I could get a room that faces the opposite direction. I told her it is the combination of the music and reverberation and therefore not enjoyable to lie out by the pool or be in my room and feel/hear the incessant thumping. But enough about that. Random notes included the fact there was no ice coming from the ice machine in the area I was staying in the Ipanema Tower. One would think somebody would have noticed at some point, but alas, no one did. My room featured a table lamp between the double beds which had a broken fixture. The bulb was at a 60 degree angle. I took a picture to show the lady at the front desk. My room also featured a used cleaning towel on the cabinet below the safe in the closet. I showed her that picture as well. Another feature was the 1970s (maybe 1980s?) Zenith television with the Cathode Ray Tube. Some of you may remember the old famous Zenith slogan: \"The Quality Goes In Before The Name Goes On\". Well, the t.v. could have used a bit more of an updated quality. While no one goes to Vegas to watch t.v., it would have been nice to have one that wasn't quite so old - say 30 - 40 years out of date! At midnight (yes I was in bed at midnight), the radio alarm clock went off. Either the last guest wanted to get a bit of shut-eye before partying hard the previous night, or someone thought it might be amusing to set the alarm for the next unsuspecting guest. NOTE to hotel housekeeping staff: Please ensure the alarm is not on when you do your room clean-up and room clean-up means picking up your cleaning towels. Do a room sweep like guests do before they check-out. :) Now about that wifi ... The $13.95 cost of wifi for 24 hours isn't unreasonable for a hotel in Las Vegas, but it should work! Having to find a Starbucks or other such locale in order to have consistent wifi service when paying $13.95 does not sit well with me. And despite being 'warned' that you are paying for service that may not be consistent, I would venture to guess that most of us would expect to get value for money and be able to take advantage of something that most of us consider commonplace in our own homes. To her credit, the desk clerk reversed the wifi fee, thus the $0 balance. Was the Rio awful? No. But attention to detail by the housekeeping staff and hotel management using common sense about the type of music at poolside and how it affects all guests, would go a long way in ensuring a comfortable stay. Also, be aware that for most people, getting to the Rio requires a taxi ride from partner hotels located on the Strip. And you cannot bring your luggage (even carry-on) on the shuttle - this is great business for the taxi industry! Hmmm.... I wonder if it was deliberate?

Room service was reasonably Vegas priced and the food was expertly prepared and of the highest quality. Service was quick, friendly and polite. The only thing that dated this 20+ year old property was the TV, which was a 27inch tube set, but that did not bother us one bit, considering the million dollar view behind it. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Just a few minor things: 1) no free internet- internet access is 13 bucks a day. 2) sneaky honor bar-sensors detect any movement inside. If you open it, you will be charged for ANY item, even if you just examine it and put it back. 3) due to the legendary buffet and nightly headline shows,parking is difficult in the early to mid- late evening.

(minimum I mind you..) So, I skipped it and picked up all my necessities at Target to give myself a quick pedi for less than $10.00. Restaurants.. there is a variety. We only ate once at the pub/brewery that is right outside the Mascarade part of the casino. All the other restaurants in the hotel seemed way to pricey. I ate out at the Fashion Show Mall where they have a huge food court. Food was way more affordable there and I also found a Carl's Jr. on Flamingo where I ate at a couple of times. My husband was provided breakfast and lunches each day through the hotel and said the food was good. They were served mexican food one day at lunch and italan food the next day for lunch. Okay, I think I've basically covered it... Bottom line, we won't stay there ever again... If you do, here are a few recommendations... There is a Target store about 3 miles down the road on Flamingo. Go over there and buy a package of 18 Keurig cups for $12.00. Also pick up some snacks and drinks while you are there so you don't have to spend so much money on food and drinks... There is a dollar tree store in the same parking lot. I stopped in there and picked up utensils and other cheap stuff like that for our room. I never did actually go into the pool area, just quickly checked it out. The music was loud like I had read in prior reviews.

I refused to pay either one, so used my Blackberry for internet, and went to the fitness center at UNLV for $10/day. ( The facilities at UNLV were far superior, and they had a real pool!) The first night I was at the Rio, I was awakened by hotel fire alarm going off about 1:00 am which blares over the phone speaker. I suspected it was caused by some partier somewhere in the hotel and wasn't too concerned, then buried my head in my pillows to muffle the noise.. Eventually, the announcement came that it was a false alarm, and they were \"invesigating the cause\". The minor frustrations aside, I woke up the next morning, got ready and started to head down to the convention...only to find some guy passed-out on the floor - right in front of my door! I thought he was dead. His glazed eyes were partially open, but I saw (heard) he was breathing, then just got really angry. Some woman who looked to be a security person was pacing around, and told me she thought the guy belonged in my room...so didn't do anything.

She seemed apologetic, but didn't offer to move me to a different room, or anything. I wanted to leave, but only continued to stay there because of the convenience. Long story short, if you want a place that is restful and sane, the Rio is NOT for you. If however, you wish to relive your college frat days, then this is the place for you.

We didn't arrive until after 4pm, and there was no line so check-in was simple and quick. I didn't ask for an upgrade since I've been told here on the TA forum that all rooms are suites so decided to just hope for the best. I'd been told that the Masquerade tower was newer, but the Ipanema tower was more recently renovated, so we were glad to be told that we had been assigned to the Ipanema Tower. I'd also been told the Maquerade Tower rooms could sometimes have noise from the pool and nightclub areas. The room was clean and view was toward the Wynn and downtown so at kind of an angle but was great for us since we don't have mountains at home and also enjoy that view in Vegas. There was a nice shower and the water pressure was the best we've ever had in a hotel anywhere. There was a sink in the separate room with the toilet and shower, and there was a sink and dressing area outside along with a nice large closet with mirror sliding doors and safe inside along with the fridge. There was a Keurig coffee maker but unless you bring your own K-cups, you will pay $12.00 for 3 if I remember correctly (or it may have been for 4). There was a nice sized couch and coffee table, sitting bench at the foot of the bed, writing desk and 2 chairs, 2 nightstands, and as mentioned above that bed was very comfortable. We never watch TV when we are in Vegas so can't remember if it was a tube or flat screen, but it was in an Armoire piece of furniture. The air quality in the room was great, and there was good insulation between the rooms. Our neighbors decided they had to crank the music up and party at about 2:30am, so after a call to the front desk and quick action by security, we didn't have a problem with noise the remainder of our stay. I always recommend a person stay on the strip for a first Las Vegas visit, but the Rio offers a change of pace and different option for those of us who have been there before and are looking for something off-strip. Or if the rate is better at the Rio than on strip, it is really worth considering since the rooms are large being suites, and there are shuttles to transfer people to the strip. It also sits across to the east from the Gold Coast and Palms. The Gold Coast also has shuttle service to it's sister property, the Orleans and to the strip. So even if a person doesn't have a rental car, there is transportation to other Vegas locations. I would recommend the Rio to anyone looking for a nice sized room, comfortable bed, and I didn't even mention the buffet (it's large) or other dining or entertainment choices.

The Voice mail stated that due to the fact that our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was on our room door maid service was not performed and if we wish for service to call Housekeeping.

The Manager stated that a Housekeeping Supervisor walks the Casino Guest Room Floors at 8am each morning taking down room numbers of customers with their \"DND\" signs still out on the door and place them on a list for no Housekeeping service needed. I told the manager that it is our practice that we leave our room each day where ever we stay at Caesars properties prior to 10:30am each morning and get our room serviced. She then told me she would place a note on our room to get serviced each morning after 10:30am. I warn you when you check in you will need to ask the desk, call VIP service or Housekeeping and find out what the policy is if you leave the room after 8am in the morning and removing the \"DND\" sign from your room door.

To set the record straight, I am a seasoned traveler both domestically and internationally, so I have realistic expectations on hotels. The Rio is a fantastic bargain! Our room was clean and spacious. We were on the 11th floor of the Impanema Tower with a great view of the mountains. When we arrived (approx 2pm) , there was a long line for check in, however the reception desk was adequately staffed and the total wait time was about 10 minutes. The clerk was very nice and upgraded our room upon request. Was the room flawless? No, but there was NOTHING to be fearful of. The only thing that stood out was you could see the seam in the carpet where the two pieces met. Who cares! The television was a 27 in' CRT but its Vegas, are you really in your room to watch TV???? The casino was lively and fun, the \"Buffet of Buffets\" is a great value if you like buffets (don\u2019t bother going to the IP or PH buffets though....hideous.... The off strip location is really the only detractor for the Rio, however they have shuttles that run until 1am to both Bally\u2019s and Harrah\u2019s on the strip. While we were there, the shuttles were consistently full, and they do give priority to their higher category gamblers, which is understandable. Housekeeping was consistent, fresh towels and general room cleaning everyday around 10am. We dined at the VODOO Steakhouse atop the hotel and it was outstanding. It is ala carte so it can be a bit pricey but the view is exquisite. We both had steaks and sides, I had the \"witch doctor\" and my girlfriend had wine and desert. Our tab was $160....HINT....visit Tix 4 Tonight and for six dollars you get a voucher for 25% off your entire tab. Basically, for six dollars my entire tip was covered......AWESOME! The VODOO lounge is nice as well, it is an outdoor night club. was dead when we visited, but the view was incredible. The pool area is very nice as well....with the beach pool and one other unheated pool, along with a large heated pool, and two large hot tubs. There is a \"top optional\" pool which requires an admission fee, but there are no kiddos around! There is bar and food service available as well. Security was never an issue; uniformed personnel were consistently patrolling the property. The Rio is a very good hotel whose only real draw back is not being situated on the strip. Its NOT the Bellagio or Wynn, but you aren\u2019t paying crazy nightly rates either. Nothing to do with the Rio, but if you are taking in a show, avoid Hypnotist Unleashed at all costs. We have seen both Anothy Cools and Marc Savard, and loved them both. This show was fradualant, as they coached the participants what to say and do, neither Cools nor Savard would do that, and when THEY gave someone a suggestion it lasted the entire show, the Hypnotist Unleashed guys are frauds!!!! I was on stage, thank god. The \"open bar\" consisted of rock gut liquor, if you wanted anything else it was premium, since when is Malibu Rum considered premium? The theater on Harden St is a HOLE!

We had a king bed and sofa in a huge room. For $49. Can't be beat! The staff: completely and totally respectful and courteous. The casino: a little dark, a little dated. I'm not a gambler so I could not care less. The restaurants: The World Buffet: Great for such an awesome amount of food The All American Bar and Grill: We had a fantastic meal the fist night, but subsequent meals were awful. Gaylord Indian Restaurant: this should not be missed. Wonderful decor, attentive staff, and outstanding food Buzio's Seafood Restaurant: Overpriced and sub-par food. Honestly, we could get much better seafood someplace else. The only shining star to this restaurant rests with the small bar before you get into the restaurant, and the outstanding bartender. He was great. McFaddens: Where else can you get cheap beer, cheap service, and cheap food (?) Really loud because the DJ would come on every few minutes and announce the latest cheap beer price. Yuck. Sau Paulo Cafe: Only open for breakfast, but that's until like 2:00 p.m. Good food, nice waiters, and a good alternative to the huge breakfast buffet. By the way, the breakfast buffet is about $20 each. I don't know about you, but there's no way I can eat $20 worth of food for breakfast. Burger King: The meat was grey, the soda was minus the flavor (so we got seltzer water) and it was $10 for a burger and soda ONLY. Starbucks: Okay, so there is a Starbucks AFTER you get to the Sau Paulo Cafe, towards the convention center. This place was FANTASTIC. Open 6:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. This place is not a part of the RIO. They have their own bakery and make all their own pastries. There is a smaller Starbucks in the Rio Casino which is highly advertised, but nobody told us about this Starbucks! It's smoke-free and large and wonderful. Cabs and shuttles: We wound up taking mostly cabs because the shuttles would drop us off only at Harrahs and we had to wind up walking to any other hotels. Although the Rio is barely off the Strip, it seemed like it took forever to get to other casinos on the Strip. Entertainment: Jersey Boys at the Palazzo was the most amazing show we have ever seen. Bar none. Terry Fator at the Mirage was also astounding. I would recommend signing up for the message service on your cell phone that list the latest deals. You get text messages about how you can save on things from dinners to drinks to shows. You can do this at the service counter at the Rio. And get a Player's Card for discounts at restaurants. On another note, we had no coffee maker in our room, but others in our party did. (and they were charged for the coffee. FYI: take your own coffee packets). When we called the front desk to complain, we were told that nobody had a coffee maker that enjoyed our price discount. Hmm, others in our party did, at the same price we got. When I mentioned this, management immediately took $15 off our room rate (for one night). Everything in Vegas is expensive. Drinks were $10-$12. Meals were $10 for a hamburger. It used to be that drinks and meals in Vegas were very inexpensive. No more. Shows are from $120 for Jersey Boys to $200 for Celine Dion.

The only think I didn't like was the shower had old tiles with stained grout. It wasn't dirty at all, just unsightly. The other people in our party had their own rooms and some of them had bathrooms that had been redone so I think they're just working on it and will eventually finish them all. Being off-strip was really not an issue. They had a shuttle that ran I think from 10am-1am (don't quote me on that, it says on the website if you want to be sure) and that was very reliable and quick. Really didn't bother me at all as I thought it would. We didn't use the pool because it rained all three days we were there (UNREAL, right?? this was our luck. needless to say we didn't gamble much).

It is not on the Strip, but it does have a free shuttle bus to the Strip, which is convenient. I have stayed at other casinos / hotels not on the strip, and had not previously been disappointed, but I can sum up the Rio in two words: NO FRILLS. The Rio's prime objective is to get the guest out to the casino floor, and if not the casino, then into one of their extremely overpriced restaurants. The Rio is not convenient to anything unless you want to drive; don't know many people who take the free shuttle to the Strip at 6:00 am for breakfast. The room was large and well appointed, but that was the only positive. There was no free in-room coffee, no cable at all - just local channels, a charge to use the gym, a charge for WiFi, overpriced restaurants, the pool closed at 7:00 pm, and to top it off, no amenities provided (water bottles, coffee, juice, etc.) for the over 200 conference attendees (all staying as guests at the hotel). The line for their $43 buffet was at least an hour long every evening, so it was off to the Strip to find something reasonable - not convenient at the end of a long day. In addition, they will put a hold on your credit card of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY - more than the room rate charge - just in case you use anything that is free at other hotels. I enjoy my perks because I stay in Vegas at least two months out of every year. Let me assure you that I will not EVER stay at the Rio again.

The DJ'S were playing all our favourite songs, so it was a good time. The drinks pool side were very expensive. $20 bucks for a daquari and a beer.

We arrived to our room at about 2:30 pm. We quickly checked it out after having been at the hotel for four hours already. My wife thought she smelled something in the room , but I told her it was just the septic smell we had encountered outside and it must be coming in the window vent. We then went to get our luggage. Shortly after unpacking, my wife and I began smelling a septic odor around the bathroom. We tried to rid odor ourselves but could not. We showered and changed from our travel clothes. At that point, I had placed my $120 shoes on the floor at the window to let them \"air\" and dry in the sunlight. I take great care of all of my shoes and even after 8 months, they were like new because, for the most part, I usually wear work boots or sandals (of course, the first time I travel light, I put on the only other pair I had brought which were sandals). We contacted the front desk about the odor as we left out to eat at their, what was once, great tasting buffet. We decided to play in the casino for a bit after eating. At about 11pm we finally went back to the room but were disappointed to find it now smelled even worse. We were planning on having some more fun but decided to call the front desk again right away to tell them about the odor (we had noticed this smell very strongly outside the hotel also). An engineer came to inspect for the smell complaint within 15 minutes. He said they needed to replace the toilet gasket. He called the desk and told them to move us and a bellhop was there in 5 minutes. We were a little frustrated, annoyed and getting tired. In the rush to pack up and move, I did not realize that someone had earlier closed the curtains in our room. I forgot all about the shoes, if they were even still there. The next morning I went to the pool while my wife attended the convention. At about 3pm, we met up at the room to change for dinner. It was then that we realized my shoes had been left behind in the first room. The front desk had us speak with security staff. We were instructed to meet them outside the original room. We waited for 40 minutes, no-one came. We called security with a hallway phone. They told us they weren't allowed to go in the first room without the new tenants permission (What ?!! The maids can enter!!). WHY DIDN\"T THEY COME TELL US AS WE STOOD IN THE HALLWAY FOR 40 MINUTES?!! We checked our room phone when we returned and also found no missed calls. We made approximately 10 attempts to get help from hotel staff and security, including a manager, over the next day and a half. We received no responses at all from security until they took a report at 2pm on Sunday the 14th. At that time, the security member, Larry, seemed more annoyed at taking the report than being interested on how the shoes disappeared. Oh yes, I failed to mention, since no-one would bother to look for the shoes, I and my wife went to the room ourselves. The family was very nice and let me look behind the curtains which were halfway open. There couldn't have been anyone in that room larger than a mens size 8, I am a 13. The Hotel RIO's \"Third Party Risk Management\" firm, CCMSI, flat out denied the reimbursement claim. It might not be so bad if the circumstances were different. We did not ask for the Hotel RIO to smell like a sewer was running around and through it. A maid had cleaned that room just before we got it. We know because we checked in early and had to call a few times to find out when it was ready. Why didn't she report the smell? We didn't ask to be uprooted from the room hastily. The bellhop was already grabbing bags and garments as I was trying to collect our valuables privately from the safe and my wife was still trying to pack up. They even had the pools area closed for a \"private' local radio staion party on Sunday without any prior notification that we could find anywhere. It was only around 110 degrees outside, so it's not like any of the actual paying hotel guests would have liked to use the pools or jacuzzis. You might think a large hotel/casino chain would want to take care of their customers. Actually, when we were moved to the new room, I was told they were taking $30 off of our bill for the inconvenience. When checking out, we had to see a manager because they had failed to apply the $30 credit. Evidently, The RIO doesn't care. They just pass you off like lost luggage. My wife had read many poor reviews for the RIO, along with a few okay ones prior to the convention. With a little apprehension, we decided to stay at the RIO, mainly because it was the convention site. Next time, we'll stay across the street at the Gold Coast.

There are 2 towers, the Masquerade and the Ipanema. The front desk person shared that the rooms in the Masquerade tower are not yet renovated, while those in the Ipanmea tower are, so we paid the $20 upgrade fee to be moved into the Ipanema tower. There are 2 free shuttles that run every half hour, one will drop you off at Harrah's and the other will drop you off at Bally's. You can be picked up and go back to the Rio by that same means if you like. This was a nice plus to avoid having to pay cab fare to get back to the strip. The only issue is depending on how busy it is when you are there, you may not make the cut to board the shuttle if maximum occupancy is reached before your place in line. Based on the timing of my visit this time, that was not an issue, but I have been in a position before where I could not board because the shuttle was already full, which wa not really a huge deal for me since the shuttle runs regularly. We ate at a few different eateries there, the All American Bar & Grille, the Sports Deli, and the Carnival World Buffet. Food at all establishments was good. There is also a Starbucks for the coffee lovers. There is a spa avaible, which I did not get a chance to visit on this trip, but hope to next time maybe. The room was comfortable and roomy. I did not make use of the mini bar, but a nice variety of items was included. Our room faced the pool and the strip. Loud music began at 10AM in the pool area, which we could clearly hear up in our room on the 11th floor, so if you seek quiet, you maybe should not get a room facing the pool.

I chose the hotel as it was the location of my convention. The hotel is off the strip but transport to the Strip is easy via shuttle or taxi. The Rio has good sized rooms, some renovated , some not. There is a significant difference. I changed room and towers (the hotel has 2 towers) during my stay. My original room in the Masquerade Tower was sufficiently in need of renovation that I probably wouldn't have returned to the Rio but a friend helped me arrange a room change and the new room, in the Ipanema Tower was much better. I did see a renovated room in the Masquerade Tower which was good, so just make sure you ask for a renovated room or the Ipanema tower. This is not the Bellagio, so don't expect fancy, but the renovated rooms are quite nice. Be aware that a pool side room will have noise from the disco at the pool during the day (10am - 6pm). A high floor doesn't seem to offer extra insulation from the noise. The room was quiet at night. On room rate alone the Rio appears to be good value however, they charge for everything. My original room didn't have any kind of tea/coffee making facility. The second did have a coffee machine however there was a charge to use it. The internet is expensive (US$14 a day) and only works inside your room. I had some parcels delivered during my stay and had to pay to pick them up. The minimum cost is US$5 but they charge by weight. Mine weighed a couple of kilos and cost US$30. I have never experience this at any other hotel, including the Hilton, Las Vegas which is also off the strip and probably a similar standard of hotel. There are 2 Starbucks and a couple of general stores in the building where you can buy most things you will want including fruit, drinks, cereal, junk food and souvenirs. There is one store at the bottom of each tower and they do not stock all the same products, if you can't find something it is worth wandering over to the other tower. I did use the hairdresser and spa. The spa was a surprise, it was much higher quality than I expected for this level of hotel. I will most likely stay there again, as that is where future conventions are being held and where my friends will stay.

We had booked 5 months in advance and had to complain to eventually get the room changed. 2) The Rio constantly has its hands in your pocket for things that are common in other hotels to make your stay enjoyable. $8 for a cup of coffee, $25 for a simple meal (one person), $14 for 1 day of internet, $10 for a single drink in the pool (and you can't bring any in.. you are checked at the door), $4 for a bottle of water.. be ready to open your wallet. We walked to the Gold Coast everyday since the buffet was so nice, clean, and reasonable... stay there :)!! 3) We had to call to get our room done after 4:00 one day.. and also had to run and find toilet paper off the maid's cart because it was not changed. 4) We were kicked out of the pool so the management could have a party for their security company.. they actually kicked paying customers out of the pool area (which needs longer hours anyway). People were furious. When people walked to the desk and complained to the management, they said \"We reserve the right to close the pool\".. LOL.. aren't people paying for this? Can we have our room for free? People were basically bullied by management. I could go on and on. A pool cashier even tried to rip us off for a pair of goggles... LOL .. you had to be there.

The room was large with a couch. The bathroom is fine. Normal sized tub. Big long counter in the dressing room area. The room seemed clean, but dated. Perhaps this tower is last in the line of renovations. The casino seemed dated to me now. It is smoky and dark. The tables were usually pretty open. Really everything in the whole place seemed pretty dated. Whatever show is supposed to go around on the ceiling still didn't work. Every once in awhile a cocktail waitress would climb up on top of a slot machine and do a little choreographed dance or sing a chorus of a song. The All American Bar and Grill was pretty good. Most of the service was attentive. The food was good. Our waiter, the first night, seemed like he was annoyed to be there. He was short with us. We were short on his tip. The Casino Buffet was also pretty good. The food was probably slightly above average buffet food. There was a long line for ice cream. The crab legs were very small. The frozen yogurt/daiquiri place near check in was pretty good. I enjoyed a little fro-yo a couple times actually. The shopping in the Rio is non-existant still. Probably worse than in 2005.

So far I've stayed at the Excalibur (ick!), Monte Carlo, Luxor (tower rooms ONLY), Flamingo (GO rooms are AWESOME!!), and now the Rio. Part of my stay was comped (3 out of the 4 nights we stayed) but that doesn't sway my opinion of the place. Yes, the rooms are BIG. Beds are oh so comfortable. The pillows are lacking but I've had worse. You get 2 fridges in the room (one's a mini-bar but the other is empty for your own stuff). We liked the bathroom. Spacious for 2 people to get ready at one time. The shower/tub combo is average. Tub isn't large enough for the average adult to bathe in (typical). The shower had great water pressure and there was ample space to put your shower necessities which was nice - no fumbling. View was of partial-strip - what I expected. Rooms could use an update. The bench at the end of the bed was a bit crusty - they really need to get rid of these. Having the extra seating in the room (sofa, chair, desk with 2 upright chairs were nice and allowed us to hang in the room at times without feeling cramped). This hotel is not on the strip. No airport/hotel shuttle, which they SHOULD have since they are not a Strip hotel. Cab fare was reasonable from the airport - $25 to get there and around $18 back (I believe there was traffic on the way there). We did use the free hotel shuttle to their strip properties (Ballys and Harrahs) and took a cab back to the hotel (this was because we didn't want to wait in the heat of August for them). The cab back to the hotel ran about $10-$15 (depending where we left from). The casino is okay. We didn't \"win\" but we did play a LONG time on what we did put in. We didn't fare any better at any of the strip casinos either. Cocktail service at the Rio was AWESOME. We never had any problems or a long wait any of the 4 nights we were there. Yes, the entertainment (show in the sky, the servers who dance/sing) is WAY lame. Felt we were at the America's Got (some) Talent Casino. They really need to stop with the singing and dancing. No one stops and watches it except for the pervy men who gawk at the dancers and then don't tip them when they're finished. I just don't see the point of this. I do have A LOT to say about the food during our stay, but those are separate reviews. Overall, I like the Rio. I will stay again but only if they give me a good deal (future comp?). I'd rather stay on the strip and have the convenience of other restaurants and the option to run to Walgreens for cheap soda and snacks (Rio wanted $3.95!! for a single soda in their store). And, I would be sure to bring my own pillow and pay for an upgraded room with a Jacuzzi.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for; bring your own conditioner and K-cups!\u201d", "Author": "Digoryk", "ReviewID": "UR117054079", "Content": "My husband and I have been to Vegas many many many times. I've already lost track how many times my 22 month old daughter has been in her short life! We have stayed in lots of different hotels, rated between 3 stars and 5 stars, including Venetian, Palazzo, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Ballys, Harrahs, Caesar's Palace, South Point, Stratosphere, Orleans (I think I missed a few more). This is our second stay at Rio; last time was about 4 years ago. We chose this hotel purely for price; we needed 2 rooms for 2 nights as my mom came along to help with my daughter. The Good: -The price; we got a fabulous deal on the 2 rooms because we have Total Rewards cards (players card---useful for getting comps!) -Based on other reviews we read, we requested rooms in the Ipanema Tower near each other. The rooms were very spacious, clean, and had modern decor. They had to give us rooms that were designed for disabled guests. When I asked what that meant, the lady at check in just said that we would have grab bars in the bathroom. For the most part, that did seem to be the main difference. Also, in the closet, the bar that hangs clothing was low and my mom's room only had a walk in shower with a place to sit inside the shower. Our room had a tub with a fold down bench. Since I'm an Occupational Therapist, I took a quick glance at the equipment and grab bar placement in our room (didn't check out my mom's closely); the equipment seemed nice, and there were more than enough grab bars around the tub area and the toilet. I probably would have moved 1 of the grab bars to be more forward to help with getting up from the toilet, but since there were so many, I think it would do the job. I didn't have a tape measure, but the toilet seemed to be raised, which was good. -We had a great view of the Strip and the pool area! -The elevators always came quickly. We had a 7th floor room in a 20 story tower; we only had a problem getting down on the morning we left because lots of people were probably trying to use the elevators to leave at the same time. The not so good: -We arrive at 11 PM on Thursday night, which is typically not a busy night for Vegas hotels. When we pulled into the valet, there was only 1 bellman working! We had to wait about 10 minutes for the poor overworked man to bring the cart over to get our stuff out of the car. -Although the line was relatively short and there were 4 people working at the front desk, we waiting at least 20 minutes to get to the front of the line and it took at least 10 minutes to get through the check in process. It felt very inefficient. The lady who checked us in was nice and accommodated our requests. -There was a Keurig coffee maker in our room, but no K-cups (the pods containing the grounds that you need to actually make coffee); you could buy 3 K-cups for $8 in the minibar! Had we known about the Keurig, we could have brought our own K-cups from home! Just and FYI, I think every Vegas hotel we've visited has had NO coffee maker in the room; I always figured it was their way of cutting down on cost and encouraging coffee sales in the lobby. -There was no hair conditioner in the room; the shampoo is marked as \"conditioning\". I have long hair and wasn't happy about this. -Although the decor was nice, the maintenance seemed lacking. There was a big stain on the curtain, the sofa was sagging in the middle, and the hallway outside our room had a strange excessively perfumey smell. Additional comments: -We opted to self-park and move our stuff ourselves when we checked out because we did not want to have to wait for a bellman to assist us; we parked in the Masquerade garage, which turned out to be clear across the casino from the Ipanema Tower. Not a huge deal, but I thought I would mention it. We saw signs in the hotel for another parking garage, the \"Carnival\", but when we were driving, we could not find it (we could have asked, but did not bother) -My husband thoroughly enjoyed playing in the 9pm Texas Hold Em tournament (he cashed!) and had fun playing a cash game afterwards. I also did well with the slots (I actually don't expect to come home with money, so a good gambling weekend is one in which I come home with most of my bankroll :) ) -The Show in the Sky was just OK; but, hey, it was free and you get what you pay for. -We went to visit the Outlet over by the Silverton Casino, opened fairly recently; just an FYI, a bunch of the stores, like GAP, Ann Taylor LOFT, and Coach are only accessible from the outside, meaning, you have to walk out into the triple digit heat to get to them. The outlets at Primm are all accessible from the inside, making for a better shopping experience in my opinion. Summary: -We would only stay at the Rio again if we could not find a room on the Strip for a good price. There was nothing exceptionally bad about staying here, I just prefer being on the Strip.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cSome Good, Some Not So Much\u201d", "Author": "bluewater1357", "ReviewID": "UR117052878", "Content": "Beginning with the positive, 100% of the staff at the RIO was helpful, friendly, and professional. Normal check-in is 4PM. I checked with the front desk around 12:30PM; our room was not ready but they registered us anyway and told us to come back at 2 (via the VIP line) to pick up our key. Very nice. The room they checked us into, while prepared well by the maids, had some nasty stains on the carpet and the headboard, and the shower curtain was musty smelling. We complained and were cheerfully given another room more to our satisfaction. Very nice. We were in the older section of the hotel, and like me, it is showing its age; time for some carpet, paint, wallpaper, furniture. We did get a very good deal on the room though, so can\u2019t complain too much. Not a great idea to go to the desert in August to get a sun tan; pretty brutal that southern Nevada sunshine. We did go out to the pool one time for a few hours. We prefer to relax in a quiet atmosphere while at the pool, but with the music screaming, it\u2019s party time at the RIO\u2019s pools; the younger guests had way more fun than us old folks did. The well-known \u201cshow in the sky\u201d sure is different these days as well. They still use the carnival floats that hang from the ceiling, transporting bead tossing guests and performers, but that\u2019s where any similarity to the real Rio Carnival ends, as the 9PM stage show was nothing more than a reenactment of a lap dance at a strip club, (not that there is anything wrong with that, it\u2019s just that I really used to enjoy the carnival themed show, and there were young kids in the audience as well). In general, gambling anywhere near the strip aint what it used to be either. Anyone who knows what a full pay video poker machine is, or what the difference between 3/2 and 6/5 black jack is, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead playing in these casinos; Benny Binion would roll over in his grave!

Third trip to Vegas, but the first one to the Rio. (Other 2 times we stayed at The Flamingo) I had booked a standard nonsmoking king suite, but upon checking in, they told me they had none left and offered me a nonsmoking queen, or smoking king. I opted for the smoking king, hoping for the best. Funny thing is, a friend of mine who was traveling with us, was behind me in line at check in, and somehow was given a nonsmoking king even though \"they had none left\". Our room ended up being on the 13th floor (why a casino has a 13th floor baffles me) of the Ipanema tower. The second we got off the elevator, it reeked of cigarette smoke. I have stayed in smoking sections of hotels before, and they have never smelled this bad. Our room was pretty nice for a standard room, with the exception of the cigarette smell. Very nice size for a standard room, probably double the size you would normally see for a standard room. The bathroom/dressing area counter tops, desk, coffee table, and end tables were all granite, which was a nice touch. The carpet was pretty worn, with a seam right through the middle of the room that was fraying. I would have also liked to see more power outlets. There was only 1 outlet available by the desk to plug my phone charger in to. Had to plug the other one in in the bathroom/dressing area. The casino was pretty nice, but pretty dark compared to other casinos. Maybe it's supposed to add to the nightlife vibe of the place.There was a good variety of table games, as well as slots. Most table minimums were $10 or $15. The only way to play blackjack at $5 was on a video blackjack machine, which seats 5 players, like at a regular table and has a video tabletop and virtual dealer on a screen. This was fun, however went by crappy single deck, 6:5 BJ payout rules. There could have been a few more cocktail waitresses on the casino floor as well. Service was kind of slow, but that's to be expected when they are understaffed on waitresses, even when you tip them well. There was a free shuttle that took you up to the strip (either Harrah's or Bally's) and back that ran every half hour, but sometimes left early so we ended up waiting over a half hour a couple times for it if we got to the pickup spot 5 or 10 minutes before the hour. Service stops at 1am, so be prepared to pay for a cab for a ride back from the strip if you plan on partying late elsewhere. And trust me, you will want to take a cab. The walk is a lot longer than you think it is. Ask me how I know. haha The show in the sky was pretty cool, and fairly raunchy. If you bring your kids, you probably don't want to bring them to this, unless you want them to see scantily clad dancers grinding on each other. (I never understood why people bring their kids to Vegas in the first place) After the show, the bartenders at one of the bars right by the show (can't remember the name of it - the circle one near all the shops in the masquerade village) put on a flair show which is pretty cool. You may want to bring your own snacks and bottled water, as everything in the souvenir/convenience store in the hotel is very expensive, as expected. $2.50 for a candy bar and $7 for a 8 pack of 12oz bottles of water? You can get a better deal on water from the people selling bottled water out of coolers on the strip for $1 a bottle (full size bottles too)", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot exactly family friendly\u201d", "Author": "Nat B", "ReviewID": "UR116968191", "Content": "This isn't the first time i've been to Vegas with my family.

Our room which overlooked the pool was extremely loud, as the pool DJ was on pretty much all day. The casino was smokey, more so than others i've been too, and the hotel had dance girls, yes dance girls paid to dance on or near the slots. It was awkward to have stayed there with family.

After reading some of the reviews I was pretty fearful of staying here, but why not if I'm only paying $78.40 for my entire stay of 5 nights, 6 days. Thanks to the Total Rewards card I was able to get such a great deal. I was traveling along with my boyfriend, a birthday present for him, and my cousin w/ her husband, an anniversary trip for them. Transportation/Check-In: Each couple arrived at separate times as we were departing from different states. My boyfriend and I got there first and took the shuttle from the airport to the Rio. If that's something that you will do, as opposed to a taxi, it's fairly easy to pay for a ticket either one-way/roundtrip at any of the windows exiting the airport. Total price was $24 roundtrip for the both of us. there was no rush for us, especially since it was my boyfriend's first time in Vegas. I loved the look on his face as we rode past the hotels. When we arrived, you could tell that the hotel from the outside was pretty dated and the windows needed cleaning, but I'm not too picky w/ things like that. Due to where the shuttle drops you off, the entrance into the hotel is by the Carnival Buffet. Once you get over by the casino area you can smell the smoke here and there. Still not an issue. Check-in was fairly easy and a breeze. Although they don't openly tell you (I was informed by a Total Rewards rep), if you are paying w/ a credit card for your room, they hold $100 per day for incidentals and charges, BUT if you don't plan on breaking anything or charging anything to the room then I'd say give them $200 cash as a deposit. This amount is paid on top of what your room costs, but you get the $200 back upon Check-out. Room: We were located in the Ipanema Tower on the 12th floor. Upon entering the room you could tell that the room had been thoroughly cleaned b/c it smelled of clean...if I'm not sounding too crazy. Lol. It was the typical setup for a \"suite\" room. There was a refrigerator along w/ a small counter space and mirror right by the door. Walking in further there was a sofa w/ a table in front and a standing lamp on the side. There were 2 Queen size beds (as they didn't have the 1 King we requested, but that just gave my boyfriend and I more \"playing\" room...LOL). A desk w/ a chair and an armoire w/ a TV that needs to be updated, but who cares...Who goes to Vegas to lay in bed and look at TV? The vanity area and bathroom were nice and clean. The one thing that annoyed me was a spot that was in the carpet from what was probably spilled and not cleaned up promptly, but whatever. The beds were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO comfy! My boyfriend & I slept very well. Strip: Getting to and from the strip was a breeze. If you don't plan on driving, the Rio does have shuttles that run as early as 10am to as late as 1am. There are 2 shuttles. One runs to Bally's and the other runs to Harrah's. Regardless of which shuttle you decide to take, my suggestion is to get to the shuttle ahead of the time you want to get on, at least 10mins before...it gets pretty crowded quickly. Dining: As for the dining...I'd definitely recommend to get the 24hr buffet pass (\"Buffet of Buffets\"). With this pass you get to go to any of the buffets affiliated w/ the Total Rewards program. Carnival Buffet was good and had a little of everything. The Seafood Buffet was ok...nothing much to rave about, BUT the gelato bar was yummmmmmy!!! I must say my boyfriend & I got multiple cups of different flavors, simply to taste them. LOL... I had read previous reports about a smell coming through the vents of smoked bbq. I figured our visit had been a complete breeze outside of the stain, but on our last night the smell came full fledge through the vents. It wasn't too bothersome if you weren't by the vent, but when and if you were it got pretty nauseating at times. Anything for a free show, located right in the middle of the casino, I was also upset that the Show In The Sky wasn't going to be running while I was there. BUT...I was entertained and did join in w/ the Bevertainers. :) Overall...I didn't have too many complaints about the Rio.

Very comfortable for a family of 3. But you can hear noise from the room next door. Thankfully, our neighbors were only loud during the day but we wouldn't have been able to sleep in. Really minimal shade by the pool and only 4 cabanas available in the non-adult area for rent. At 105 degrees, we didn't stay out too long by the pool with high winds and no shade. Food quality and variety are good at the World Buffet albeit pricey. $15.99 per person for breakfast is what I expect to pay at a higher end property. We'd hoped to do the Fantasy in the Sky bead throwing only to find out that's only available on the weekends and not mid-week. Casino area is a bit dark and seems very tired. I remember in the past when visiting that the gaming area felt larger and had a better vibe. It just felt old and I definitely saw empty space that had probably had slot machines in the past. Wasn't much fun playing in the casino. Note that if you want a smoking room, the 13th floor of the Ipanema tower (not sure about the Masquerade tower) is where you'll be. Yes. This hotel has a 13th floor. And I heard some people in the elevator complain about their luck playing and staying on that floor. Location of the property isn't a big issue with a shuttle that will take you to Harrahs on the strip. And before I forget, the individual thermostats in the rooms didn't seem to work as my room temp went up 4 degrees one morning while I was downstairs and the rest of the family was stll sleeping. It doesn't sound like a lot till you realize the low was 88 degrees outside! Overall, it was an ok place to stay but I wanted to take my gaming, etc. elsewhere.

Mind you, this was a non smoking room. We stayed in the Masgarade tower. What a dump!! If you like 70's decor this is the hotel for you. The carpet was old and gross, the curtains were old fashioned brown pattern that left huge gaps to let the sun in. The shower had window in it, so that when you turned the bathroom light on in the middle of the nite it shined straight onto the bed. Or you could watch someone taking a shower from the living area. Very creepy. The furniture was complete crap. I never sat at the table or on the couch because it was just disgusting. The light fixtures in the bathroom were the old fashioned rows of big blaring bulbs. That tower is completely run down. The owners of this hotel should be ashamed of themselves.

There were four pools including one adult pool. (females could be topless) There was a $20 charge for men to enter. They were very careful about checking ID. My friend and I are both in our 50's lol so it was quite amusing. We were old enough to be the employee's mother. The pool area is beautiful the only problem we had was the music was so loud. I like to read and relax at the pool. They did check room keys and bags at the entrance. We did take in bottled water no problem and the check was really just a quick peek.

There is music and dancing later on but we left before that. The staff we met were all very friendly. Christine at the concierge desk printed our boarding passes for us and was very pleasant and helpful. No charge for this.

Aside from an unpleasant smell outside of the hotel when we arrived, we were extremely impressed with the Rio. Check-in was a breeze with only a few people in line at the time we arrived (guess it was worth taking forever to clear immigration - due to slow toddlers that wanted to walk and winding up behind an flight that arrived after us). The staff were helpful and offered a free upgrade to a suite on a higher floor. We were given a 2 bedded room in the Ipanema Tower which was the perfect location for a family with small children as it is centrally located within the hotel. The room was slightly outdated with older furniture and an older bathroom suite, but it offered enough storage space for all of our clothes and the 'accessories' that come with toddlers. Our view was of the mountains and The Palms off to one side (or \"The Bunny Building\" as our son called it every morning). With floor to ceiling windows, the view provided us a little oasis in the midst of all of the bells, whistles and over the top gaudiness that we love about Vegas. It was strange to be able to truly relax while we were in Vegas, but as we were there for a wedding, there were times we needed to rest and recuperate. Housekeeping was extremely friendly and efficient and we had no complaints. Sometimes you could hear people running or laughing loudly in the hallway, but that was mostly during the day and was rare. Come time to sleep you couldn't hear a thing. The dining options were plentiful, though we only ate at the two buffet restaurants or got breakfast bits from the gift shop by the Ipanema elevators. My parents, who were staying at Paris, were jealous that we also had a Starbucks kiosk within the hotel. We were nervous at first about taking children to Las Vegas, but all of the staff in the hotel were wonderful with them. We were immediately made to feel at ease. In the Carnival World Buffet we noticed that there were actually quite a few families at the hotel. Though we can't be certain they were all staying there and not just visiting for brunch. The only downsides would be the mattresses were older so they were not that firm and the room was dated. But it everything worked and although the tv wasn't a flat screen, it was still larger than the one my parents' had at Paris in a much higher grade of suite!! The shuttle was wonderful to have to get to The Strip, though we also took taxis to Paris which were not that bad - if you didn't get stuck in traffic. We were lucky enough to get an outstanding rate due to having Total Rewards cards, so definitely give that a go when booking if you have one. We have 0 points on it and still got an unbeatable deal.

For those who like to take a small walk or don't mind the hassle of taking the hotel shuttle to the strip, RIO could be a great choice if you have a tight budget. Why Great Value? My husband and I stayed RIO over the weekend. We paid avg 50 bucks per night; but was given a Masquerade Suite (the regular price for this suite ranges from 290 to 800). What can I expect more? The suite is sooooooo spacious and the so well decor. I especially love its master room and the grant bathroom. Unlike other hotels where the use of Jacuzzi is subject to charge, I could use it free of charge in RIO. If we didn't have a tight schedule in Las Vegas, we could have stayed in our suite for two days enjoying the view outside and relaxing. I have to say, because this suite is way too great that our stay in other 4 star hotels in other cities during our trip became so \"disastrous\". Noisy? Not a case for me. The suite locates at 50th floor in the Masquerade Tower and we were way too far away from the casino. We also felt safe as an access card was required in order to access the floor we stayed. Location: As the hotel is off strip (10 mins walk from Bally), it is a little bit inconvenient for many. But with frequent shuttle service (every 30 mins) to Harrah and Bally, this setback doesn't bother us too much. Service: We most stayed outside the hotel and didn't use the hotel service too much. Not at a good position to comment on this. Tips to book hotels with great value: book with Hotwire.com.

If you like fast, frequent, and friendly drink service, this place is for you!!!! #4 The restaurants are pretty affordable, offering good buffets, and a great steak restaurant, I recommend the prime rib! and the sports bar has a great hamburger, a really nice BBQ style restaurant a few floors up. #5 The inside casino entertainment complete with live bands, dancertainment, and a bowling alley keep me absorbed on the casino floor whether I'm winning or losing, always having fun!!!

Marina took care of us the entire week, Marina's service was so OUTSTANDING that we did NOT want to change our room when we began to experience problems with our A/C for fear we would NOT get a housekeeper who was personable, pleasant and took as much pride in their work as Marina, so we endured the stuffy room conditions. We made several maintenance calls the 1st guy was very Curt rude brief in speech and abrupt in manner needless to say A/C was not fixed, I made another call the next day, waited about 30 mins , knock knock opened the door and there stood a middle aged man with a Santa Claus moustache, Martin from maintenance was SUPER nice and talked to us like we were his daughters in hopes of trying to explain the complex operating nature of the A/C he was so nice that we wanted to LIE and say that it was repaired.

The definite downsides are: 1. The casino. Outdated and tired looking, it was not the Rio of old. 2. The show in the air. Also, not like before. Maybe I'm showing my age here, but the flashy Brazilian costumes and music are gone, replaced by girls in Britney schoolgirl miniskirts, booty shaking and not much else. Extremely loud (which is fine), but soft on the quality. And the girls getting up on top of a platform on a bank of slot machines, grinding unnoticed to canned music, was largely unattractive. I felt sorry for them. It was almost embarrassing to watch. 3. Check-in. People, you have GOT to work on this. Horribly slow, with only two clerks working, and five empty terminals.

Very small pools and I believe that only 1 was heated.. my guess was the one we couldn't even get close to or fit one more body into it was so packed. We stayed by the first pool with the waterfall and when we went in it was gross. Not sure if the waterfall creates so much debris or what but is had so much stuff floating around we got out. We then just decided to pay to go into the private area pool. This was much better. Although I didn't see anyone bringing drinks/food for about 2 hours. We just took turns running out to get stuff for everyone. Music was good, pool was comfortable and gogo dancers were a nice addition. Went to dinner at for the seafood buffet... don't waist your money. Go to the actual seafood restaurant at the other end by the pool and get a good meal. The buffet was really not that good. We all agreed (12 of us). We did have dinner up top at the Vodoo and it was one of the very best meals I have ever had. Had the Bone in Ribeye. Amazing service and food!

The result was that our dinner bill had an extra $12 on it because we didn't have this card, which we could go get at the casino. However, service was good, when we asked for information ourselves - it would just be nice to get more information from the beginning, but perhaps it was because of WSOP, as the hotel was completely full.

The WSOP is going on so maybe that is why it was soooo crowded and smoky. Too much for me. We did not eat at the buffet because the prices were ridiculous. We went next door to the Gold Coast based on a previous review and found the breakfast selection very adequate and well worth the price. It was very clean and bright. I thought the gambling at the Rio was pretty awful, the hotel itself is a little difficult to maneuver, and I got turned around a few times. We ate at the Irish pub and the food there was very good and reasonably priced. The location is great is you take the shuttle or if you just stay there, but we like to go other places, and the proximity to I-15 made it very difficult because you were always in traffic no matter where you went. The strip was no better because unfortunately the Rio is centrally located so traffic for us was a problem.. We like staying outside the perimeter of 15 and the strip so we can tool around, go back to the room, relax, and then go out again. We really did not feel like we could do that easily at the Rio.

Didn't get to sleep to after 4:00AM then had to listen to the pool music again in our room the next day. We asked to be changed. Were shown a room in the Ip Tower. Was not to our liking, so we took another room in the M Tower but a much lower floor. Room was then satisfactory (no VooDoo noise). Also they keep the casino very, very cold. Also not much in the way of reasonable price food. Drinks were very, very pricey. Our room was outdated but kept very clean. TVs need to be updated. TV also blocked the view from the window.

Crab legs were skinny (Mandalay Bay actually had 1000% better crab legs). One positive for the Rio...they now have a bar in the middle...you might need several drinks to stomach this stuff.

I've been to Vegas many times. Certainly there are much nicer, newer places to stay but for the price of the rooms, really I don't think the Rio can be beat. We booked 2 rooms through Hotels.com. (If you do this, don't spend the extra money for the rooms that include the coupon book or a view, etc...because they will give you one anyway.) I've done this twice now. We paid $56 a night per room. The rooms are quite big compared to the newer hotels. They were adjoining since we had my mom and our 4 year old son. Both rooms had amazing views of the strip. The beds are really comfortable as well as the pillows and linens. They also had updated the furniture since last summer, which was great. I knew the rooms were huge, which is why I chose this hotel so my son would have a blast running around! Yes, the hotel lobby and casino is kinda \"80's\" but it's fun. It's not a pretentious place. Everyone is really nice. Another reason we picked this hotel was for the pool. I Googled Vegas cabana pics for so long and didn't see anything very detailed, so I thought this review might help others. We rented a cabana since we had my mom and our little boy with us. The cabanas are wonderful! Initially, we were having a hard time choosing to stay between the Rio and Mandalay Bay (because of the pool area). We chose Rio because it's a lot less crowded and the cabanas are a lot less expensive. We had a huge one, with a ceiling fan, flat panel TV, fridge, a huge sectional and 4 lounge chairs. The price for the 4 of us (all day) was $340 which included $340 worth of food and drinks. It was totally worth it! Our cabana server was THE BEST!!! Her name is Angelica. Ask for her. She's so nice and down to earth....really great with my special needs mother and my little son. A lot of the servers at other hotels are snotty and will only \"cater\" to the higher end clients. When considering Mandalay Bay, I spoke with the concierge. She was really nice...but she mentioned several times to tip the server right away so I would ensure great service. Makes sense, but just the fact hat she offered that advice to me told me a lot about what to expect there. Plus, none of us do that well in big crowds. The room service was fast and efficient. Staff always friendly....but the room service food wasn't good...not even breakfast. That was the only bummer. My husband and I went to the VooDoo bar/restaurant and it was great. Amazing views and the food and drinks were great. They also have this wine cellar. It's really cool if you like wine. You go down these stairs and it feels like you are in a cave. They have these really cool booths, it's pretty quiet and relaxing and they serve you wine and cheese of your choice off their menu. It's a blast. I think this is a great choice for families like ours...where you have another adult with you who can watch the kids while you spend time with your significant other.....especially if you need to book 2 rooms. My son loved the beach pool and we were very close to the shark reef at Mandalay Bay and the Dolphin exhibit at the Mirage. It was a convenient location, for not being right on the strip. If you are a family without a 3rd adult, and only need one room, I might go with another hotel that has more attractions on site for the kids. MGM, New York New York and Mandalay Bay have more to offer the little ones. My husband is a statistician, so he literally doesn't understand how people can enjoy gambling. Point being...there really is a lot to do in Vegas without gambling.

Within one hour we were completely transferred to another room. My wife and I travel a lot so we expect some problems on every trip and try not to get all upset over it. After all it is your holiday. The new room on the VIP floor is pretty much the same as the other rooms. It has a nicer TV. A pay mini bar as well as a small fridge. The small fridges at the Rio only keep things cool NOT cold.

I had never stayed there before because of the off-Strip location. For this visit, I planned to stay on-property and just sit by the pool during the day. It ended up being a very nice two-day getaway and I will likely be a regular Rio customer. The Pros: -front desk service is far superior to other Harrahs properties (with the exception of Caesars which is equally good). The desk was properly staffed, check-in at Diamond was a breeze and the attendant was very friendly. There was some sort of convention going on so the room I requested was not available. Rather than making me wait (like on a former visit to Harrahs), they immediately upgraded me to a better suite and sent me on my way. -the suite I was given was huge and beautiful! Far beyond my needs really, but no complaints from me. I believe it was the \"Cariocas\" and featured a foyer with guest restroom, full living/dining room (table seated 8 at least), large flat-screen tv, separate bedroom with two comfortable queens and another large flat-screen, bathroom with HUGE jacuzzi tub, separate shower, large granite counter topped vanity (two sinks) and his+hers closet and drawers. Tons of closet and storage space throughout. -The pool area was perfect! There are three pools: two heated, one of which has a small sandy beach, one for lounging and lap swimming, and one that is not heated (so was too cold and sat empty but still nice to gaze out at). They were not too crowded so it was easy to get a lounge chair to soak up some sun. The piped-in music was at a good level...you could still talk easily and doze off if you wanted. -One of the best features at the pool is the professional level of the wait staff. As with all the Vegas pools, the girls are attractive, but here, they actually work too! Food and beverages were served quickly, I was checked on regularly, and my waitress went out of her way to thank me for tipping her on my way out. -Food options are great here. The property is large and good food can be found any time, day or night. I especially loved my steak at the All American Bar and Grill. Perfectly grilled to medium with just the right amount of seasoning. -Gaming is as varied as you could ever want. The Cons: -Off-Stip location is a drag if you like being in the thick of things. The Palms and Gold Coast are both short walks away (although you do have to cross a busy street to the Palms). The cab to Bellagio main entrance was $7. -It seems like Harrahs is still cutting costs to the very last bone as they have eliminated the dancing \"Show in the Sky\" which was one of the fun things about Rio in the past. I didn't see it run during the entire two days, but perhaps they still do it on the weekends. -Drink service on the gaming floor was spotty. Sometimes a cocktail waitress would be there minutes after I had just been served, sometimes it would be an hour between visits. More consistency is needed.

Be prepared to walk a lot; lots of restaurant and bar choices; convenience shops are right off the casino and a nice benefit. Elevators very vast, and valet friendly. Cheap, and room is larger than your typical hotel rooms. The check in line is painfully long all the time, but I will give them credit for keeping it moving for the most part--I still waited about 30 minutes to check in at 3pm with only two front desk clerks (?). Food and drinks are good varied and decent priced. 2) Cons: lots of cons, unfortunately. Service at the front desk is very very poor if you are not a \"VIP\". Two clerks kept inviting VIPs that kept walking up to the VIP line for assistance, leaving everyone else waiting and waiting and waiting until I complained out loud to the front desk clerk at the handicapped portion of the desk who was not willing to help anyone, nor could he even make a spare key for me--quite unacceptable. Once I complained out loud, he disappeared and never came back. Room and hotel is very dated. I'm certain there are better Vegas hotels to stay in for similar rates on a Monday night. Oh...and be prepared to pay for just about everything--$.50 minimum just to print out your boarding pass.

When you walk in, you immediately noticed that nothing has changed or been updated in years. The room, which is considered a suite, has a worn out, tired look that a good remodeling could fix. It was clean and definitely liveable. We were paying a discounted rate. But, if were being charged full price, I definitely would have been upset! I have yet to understand why there's a window in the bathroom that overlooks the bedroom portion of the suite! The service continues to be excellent. On our last night, the people next door had their TV set on full blast at 2:00 AM! We called downstairs and they immediately responded and took care of the situation. On of the biggest drawbacks of the Rio is its location. It is quite a distance away from the strip. They do run a shuttle every 30 minutes between the hotel and the strip. It's prompt. The drivers are polite and helpful. However, during busy, peak times, one shuttle isn't enough. A couple of times, we ended up paying for a taxi because the shuttle was full.

My mother prefers to walk, although it is slow going and painful for her, rather than lug her wheelchair out of the trunk and try to get through the crowded casino floor but there was no where to park close enough that she could do this. When brought up to the front desk, their only suggestion was vallet parking, which we are not comfortable with. I had to drop her off and pick her up at the front doors (which the lanes were always blocked by taxis) and she still had to walk the width of the casino floor to the elevators to get to our room. It is not very handicapped friendly just by design. On the other hand, our room was very nice, surprisingly spacious, and very quiet. I'm a light sleeper but had no problems sleeping here. If we had neighbors, I didn't hear them once, no drunken laughter in the hallways, or slamming doors. It is close to the Strip but not on it and has shuttles to other casinos but we didn't use them.

I had previously stayed at this hotel three years ago and was pleased with the room. This time, the room was not so nice. Although I love the size of the room, every room is a suite. We stayed in the Ipanema tower on the 8th floor with a view of the pool and strip. The furniture was dirty, as was the carpet. The shower curtain smelled of mildew which is just so disgusting. There were two sinks in the bathroom. One of the sink's wreaked so bad whenever you ran it, just really grose. The beds weren't so comfortable and I woke up with a sore back unless I slept on my side. I am only 40 so it wasn't back problems that were an issue, it was the cheap mattress. The casino and property are kind of hokey, not up to Vegas standards for such a large resort. They do offer a free shuttle to the strip. Going into Paris Hotel and Planet Hollywood resorts just made me realize how dumpy The Rio really is for Vegas. The pool area was nice for the kids as they had a beach entry pool with waterfalls. They have about 4 pools total. The loud dance music that they have pumping all day was fun for a while, but after a few hours it was a bit annoying. I love loud music! But when the pool music is so loud like when you're in a club, it makes it hard to have any kind of conversation by the pool and not so relaxing. Three years ago they did not have the pumpin loud dance music all day by the pools, the sounds of the waterfalls were relaxing, well you can't hear the relaxing waterfalls anymore! Like I said, I don't mind the loud music, but not so loud where you have to shout in someone's ear to talk, like when you're in a club. All in all I would not stay here again. There are way too many other nicer resorts to stay in Vegas for the money..This resort is hokey..I gambled every night for two or more hours on the roulette and blackjack tables and seriously got one cocktail every two hours. Come on, the Venetian never let me go dry. Then again, Rio vs. Venetian, you get the idea..If you want a dark, hokey, drab casino and resort with stinky rooms then stay here.

There was virtually no wait for check in at about 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. Both rooms were clean, although the Masquerade Tower Room had a better view, it had that awkward bathroom window onto the bedroom that lets tons of light into the room while others are trying to sleep. Ipanema Tower especially was very quiet. We purchased an inexpensive coffee maker at Walmart before we checked in as well as staples for breakfast and occasional lunches. There is a medium sized fridge that was empty as well as a stocked mini bar we did not use. We ate a couple of times at the Gold Coast Port of Call Buffet next door, breakfast is an especially good deal and they have children's prices and made to order omelletes. Additionally we did an early morning bowling trip there too, since it is $1 a game before 8 AM during the week. We did trips to Death Valley and Rhyolite ghost town as well as Red Rocks Canyon. We also discovered a cool playground, Exploration Park on S. Buffalo Drive. The park has a short hike to a good view of the Las Vegas Valley. My wife, mother and 9 year old enjoyed seeing the Matsuri Show.Our only complaint is that we asked for adjoining rooms with my mother, who joined us for a few days, but they could not accomodate that request, but she was on the same floor.

This was the second trip with the dog in the room. Unlike the first visit with the dog in the room this time there were treats and food and water bowls presented at check in and clean up bags were present in the \"relief\" area. I read a previous review complaining that the distance to the pet relief area is too far. It is a hike but the shortest route is to take a right turn from the elevator lobby and walk on the tile walkway on the perimeter of the casino to the escalator up to the second level, walk around the new Burger King Bar to the sky walkway out to the 4th level of the Masquerade parking structure and then take the stairway down four flights to the ground level. The pet relief area is on the North side of the Masquerade parking structure. From what I know the Rio has the only grass pet relief area, the other Caesars Entertainment properties use astro turf over concrete. As in my first Pet Stay review I recommend the even numbered rooms on the South side of the 4th floor of the Masquerade Towere. The odd numbered rooms on the 4th floor have the roof of the casino at the level of the window sills. (Floor 5 and above have floor to ceiling windows.) At check in I requested a South facing room and the desk clerk gave me the floor plan and explained that the hotel has only an East and a West side. She gave us a choice of an odd numbered room and an even numbered room. I just picked the even numbered room and didn't pursue her perceived lack of North and South sides to the Masquerade Tower. Now, this is the most important part of this review....the pet stay rooms have two thick plastic cards hanging on the door handle, the DND sign and a Dog In Room sign. The first time I left the room I noticed that the signs catch in the door jam and the door did not close. I casually moved the signs and closed the door again and thought nothing of it. The next day I left the room before my wife. She apparently did not notice the problem with the DND and Dog In Room signs catching in the jam but when I came back to the room the door was ajar. Packing up to leave the next morning we realized that we were missing a few small but expensive personal items. I suggest that all hanging signs be removed from the door handle as soon as you enter the room the first time or at least stand there in the hall each time while the door closes to make sure it actually closes. I reported the missing items to security and someone came up to take a report. The security officer called up maintenance to check the door lock. It was fine, I only recalled the DND and Dog In Room cards jamming the door open when maintenance said the lock was fine. CET contracts with a third party adjuster who determined that the theft wasn't their responsibility. I'm not overly pleased with that decision but the incident will not affect our future Las Vegas choices, we'll be back to the Rio again. Some more details about this stay. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and in good condition. The bed was comfy! There was a bleached out stain on the couch, that was the only flaw (aside from the DND and Dog In Room sign glitch) and totally inconsequential. We ate dinner Saturday evening at the Seafood Village Buffet. The bill was $78 for the two of us plus we left a fat tip. The food was good with the exception of what looked like tiny lobster tails cut in half, those were not good. The rest of the fish dishes and the crab legs were fine. The sides were fine. We'll do that again sometime, just maybe not the next visit though.

We chose this hotel for the cheap price we got and we did know that it was off the strip so for the price it wasn't bad at all, especially that there is a free shuttle to two different parts of the strip, Bally's hotel and Harrah's hotel so it saved money on taking taxi's. We never walked to the strip so I'm not sure how long it would take, we did walk to the Palm hotel and that was about 10 minute walk not too far. The hotel had four pools in the one area which was nice. One was like a beach, actually had sand where the sun chairs were and a waterfall which was more for younger kids, the other three were where most of the adults hung out in, there were tons of seats. The only negatives I have was the hair dryer in the room while using it would stop working then start work about 5-10 minutes later so getting ready was kind of annoying and sometimes you could hear people flushing the toilet since it was kind of loud even in your own room and the whole hotel does smell of smoke and it was a little overwhelming at times when sitting at a table gambling. Besides those negatives I would recommend this hotel if you want cheap and don't care if your off the strip.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "menlo park", "Title": "\u201cNo better view of The Strip !\u201d", "Author": "EuroCaliGuy", "ReviewID": "UR104409425", "Content": "I remember staying at the Rio during business meetings and conventions right after it opened up.

Room was nice though and very large. My husband went to use the safe and it was not working. Called down and maintenance arrived within 10 minutes and fixed it! Went to the Whopper Bar for dinner and were very disappointed. Thought it was a \"put your own fixing on burger\" type bar. Next morning I went straight to check in to let them know about the stuff in hall and smell in room. Front desk clerk was very nice and accommodating. Since hotel full couldn't move us right away and we weren't going to be there anyway so she said she would have the room \"sprayed\" so the smell out be removed. Also she would make sure stuff in hall taken care of. Return later that night to a great smelling room. Next day, same 2 situations-room service trays in hall and cigarette smell. We are sure the people in the room adjoining ours (had the adjoining door) were smoking. Let the front desk know again up check out and they gave us a $30 credit on our room (was only paid $90 for the entire stay). Also very disappointed in table game selection.

Oh My. I was unhappy. But then again, I got a $49 room rate in the height of spring break. Thankfully, all of the front desk was staffed. At my guess it had to be 10 or so front desk staff and the line went quickly (30 minutes). The hotel recognizes when they are going to be popular and prepared for it. Good for them - and this was a Sunday night too. Furthermore, they had employees walking around to offer bottles of water for free and the dancers dancing to different songs/ on various areas around the casinos at 15 min intervals which I have never seen before at any other casino. That went on all night.. Ok it might have been a little cheesy, but I say that b/c I am a girl so I don't necessarily care about that stuff, but it added some energy to the check in time and made you look forward to your night ahead and reminded you, that YES, you are in Vegas. And these are their employees so perhaps they are getting to do something extra which they love, on top of serving drinks. How employers treat their employees makes a huge difference on the client's experience IMO. As far as the casino/bars/restaurants, the hotel doesn't come across as a depressing get drunk/lose your money hotel with a bunch of depressed people. All of the staff and clients seemed to be having fun. The room was ok. Very dated. I didn't care. It was my gateway to home the next day. Would I book this as a romantic outing. Probably not. And they call it suites, but its basically a big room. The one thing I found odd was the window from the shower to the living room? Wierd. Backtracking - when I got to the front, I could not have been more happy w/the front desk girl. Really - after staying at the top of line to the bottom (Four Seasons to Sahara), I have never had better service and that's tough to say after waiting in line for 30 minutes. The girl asked me if I had any special requests. I told her (not thinking she would accomodate), that I just wanted to be close to the elevator and close to my garage b/c I had a very early flight the next day. WOW! She accomodated both. She asked where I was parked, and I didn't know there were two garages, so that was important. And I was given a room two doors down from the elevator. I was out the next morning in 10 minutes! That is huge given how HUGE these are hotels are. So thank you RIO for staffing good people. I had so much fun that night gambling. Met a great balance of people at the $15 tables.

Since we had previously stayed at The Rio, I knew the furnishings were new. The room/suite had a king bed, with a living area (couch/coffee table) as well as a desk with both wireless and wired internet -- which worked, unlike the Monte Carlo.

We ate several times at the hotel and everything was good, we gambled a little at their casino and for the first time I won at the Rio. There weren't too many cocktail servers servicing the slot areas and I guess it is because like everywhere else, they are cutting down on employees. We saw the free Masquerade in the Sky show on Friday and Saturday, however there were no shows on Sunday or Monday, so I'm guessing their cutting back on that too.

First off, this would not be my hotel of choice if not for the fact our room was part of the trade show package. Rio's location really is a pain in the neck if you like to get out and explore other casinos or resturants. It is just far enough off the strip, on the other side of I-15, that walking is really not a good idea. So, you are left with either a cab or the Harrah's Shuttle-free, but be prepared to wait. We were there on March Madness Weekend, and the shuttle would often fill-up before you can get on. And, of course, no standing! We also made the mistake of checking in on a Friday night. Sorry to the residents of the Golden State, but Friday night is Calif. Invasion night in Las Vegas. A fine crowd-I must have counted at least 10 kids under 5, and 4 coolers-on-wheels in the check-in line. What is with parents bringing young kids and babies to a casino? The Rio, in great preparation for the big bump in weekend check-ins, had 3-count em-3 positions open for check-ins! Of course, each check-in seemed to take 20 minutes. The rooms are one of Rio's strengths. The are big, much bigger than most standard Strip rooms. I recommend the older Ipanema Tower-I think it is quieter and smaller. Besides, there is a great store and a Starbucks right by the elevators. You will need the Starbucks because in keeping with LV Hotel un-written rules, NO Coffemakers in rooms! The rooms were clean, the beds nice. I am not a big fan of watching TV in the room while in Vegas, so I didn't mind the 10 yr. old fashioned TV in the console thing. Guess Harrahs Corp. has not been clued in on flatscreens yet. Internet connection in the room was fast, and expensive at $13.95/day. They do have mini bars and refrigerators. Two bathroom sinks also. The property has a lot of eating options-we only ate at the All-American Grill-pretty good burger type joint. The do have a great pool area, although too cold to use this time. If you want to work out, be ready to shell out $22 for use of the Fitness Ctr. Now, the casino. I have to say it is in serious need of renovation/expansion. It is small to other place's standards, and is lacking in a lot of games you may like. For example, we could not find one 5\u00a2 Video Poker machine(yea we are real high-rollers)-very common in other Harrahs places. After the Sunday night exodus by the weekend crowd, the Rio became more livable, more a business hotel the rest of the week.

The room was very large, a nice surprise. Full couch, chair, coffee table. I think most will be pleased with this place. If you can wait until the week prior to your arrival as I did, the price of the rooms drop fast. Although each night was billed at a different rate, I averaged $90 for the three nights. Far below the quoted price 3 months prior to the event. Only a couple of complaints. No in-room coffee, which sucked. You must ride the elevator to the ground floor, where conveniently, there is a coffee vendor... Very obvious that this was a setup for the rental of that space to the coffee purveyor. My other complaint was the 250 lb TV. Old style behemoth. They need to get some flat screens in there, if so, it would have really been a top notch experience. So not much to complain about here, very nice rooms with great views. Although I never like the big casino hotels, you have to walk a mile to get to your car or the restaurants, they're all the same that way.

I loved the new cosmopolitan hotel - it is my new favorite - and i had planned on staying there - but it cost $400 more for my trip and they hold $150/night on your credit card - alotta moolah to just stay there - but the hotel is beautiful. however, did not win any $ there either - guess the gaming is paying the exhorbitant debt for the hotel. i've stayed at most of the hotels in vegas or been in the rooms of friends who have stayed there and i can tell you this is a great deal. it is about 1/4 mile off the strip though so if you don't have a rental car consider the transportation. i always reccomend getting a car while in vegas - the walks are long - blocks are huge - and you'll pay $20 for a cab one time when you could spend that all day to have a car to take you wherever you like. trust me - i used to live in vegas - i know what i'm talking about !!! here is my review i submitted before going to vegas - but they would not post a \"pre-trip review\" - so i'll include it now. have been to the rio many, many times as i have previously lived in vegas. just booked a last minute trip through travelocity the day before travel - and for airfare, hotel for 5 nights, and car was $717 - BARGAIN. i don't care how crappy it is really - will be out enjoying the finer things in vegas and spending my $ there !!! after the breakdown in my trip the hotel will cost a measly $280 - ridiculously cheap! that is $56/night INCLUDING tax - great deal - i've stayed at rio before and the rooms are very large compared to most of vegas - it is also being renovated and i will be requesting a renovated room and an upgrade - FINGERS CROSSED !!! then it would be a ridiculously awesome deal..lol - you can't even stay at motel 6 for $56/night including tax - and the rio has a casino, starbucks, and the best damn buffet in town - believe me - i've eaten at them all - will re-post after my stay when i get the pics off my iphone i'll include those as well happy travels to las vegas !!! =)", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat View of the strip\u201d", "Author": "PrincessR", "ReviewID": "UR95110538", "Content": "We had a corner room suite which provided us with an amazing view of the strip.

The bartenders don't hassle you to play the video poker at max bet or at a faster pace, so you basically tip a $1 per drink and you are good to go. The rooms are very big and clean, but dated.

It's easy to get comped rooms on weekdays and I choose it over all the other hotels in the Harrahs group. Free valet parking is a big plus and no resort fees. The access roads make it easy to avoid the busy strip traffic and the people waiving hooker business cards in your face.

While I understand the disappointment expressed in other reviews here, isolated problems and misunderstandings are inevitable at such a large hotel and I don\u2019t think it should be judged solely on such incidents. If you expect to spend a lot of time on The Strip, I recommend staying on The Strip rather than at a nearby resort like The Rio as transportation can be inconvenient. If you wish to stay mostly on-property or see area attractions away from The Strip, I think the Rio is a great place to stay. Most importantly, in my experience, the staff are friendly, helpful and even charming. I have found the staff to be the best part of all Harrah\u2019s properties. Every employee I encountered at The Rio offered a cheerful greeting and very good service. The concierge desk was especially helpful and assisted me with booking a flight for my wife for a family emergency. In my online reservation I had requested two non-smoking rooms in Ipanema Tower; one with a king bed and one with two full size beds. Upon check-in, the clerk cheerfully informed me she could easily accommodate these requests. She offered a strip view for an extra fee which I declined. When I informed her the second room was for my adult son and daughter, she asked if I wanted connecting rooms. I informed her adjoining rooms would be fine and this is exactly what I received. Although The Rio is promoted as an all-suite hotel, this is really not the case. I think most people would agree a suite includes a separate bedroom and the basic rooms at The Rio do not. What the basic rooms do offer is much more space than you will find in other basic Las Vegas rooms. There is a wall separating the \u201cbedroom\u201d and bath/closet area. Near the bed or beds is a small couch and upholstered chair with a coffee table and a writing desk. The bathroom includes a shower/tub and one sink. Just outside the bathroom is a closet with a small \u201cdorm\u201d refrigerator and another sink with a large countertop. Basic rooms also feature small details such as crown moldings and quality bedding, which I appreciate. The outside wall is entirely glass which offers very nice views of whatever the room happens to overlook. My room was extremely clean as was the room next door where my son and daughter were staying. These rooms overlooked the Palms resort which is attractive after dark. My parents were also staying at the Rio. Their room was also very clean and offered a \u201cStrip View\u201d which overlooked the hotels on the West side of Las Vegas Blvd. My room had a CRT television which is fine by me since watching TV is the last thing I want to do while on travel. I have heard some rooms have large, flat-panel televisions. If watching TV is a priority for you, be sure to ask the desk clerk for a room with a new, flat-panel television. The Rio offers free shuttle service to Harrah\u2019s and Bally\u2019s which are on The Strip. Since I was visiting in the days leading up to New Year\u2019s, the shuttles were often overcrowded. Although the busses arrive every half-hour, they typically could not accommodate everyone. This forced many people to wait over an hour for the next shuttle. Also consider the stops at Bally\u2019s and Harrah\u2019s are somewhat remote. The Harrah\u2019s shuttle stop is under cover in the parking garage and the Bally\u2019s stop is outside. Especially cold or hot weather could make for an uncomfortable wait. Therefore, if you wish to travel to and from the strip conveniently, I recommend taking a cab. The Rio Casino is large and laid out very well. It has two main areas. Although neither area is especially smoky, one area has a very high ceiling where the smoke is less noticeable. I had hoped to see the \u201cShow in the Sky\u201d. Unfortunately, that show is dark Monday through Wednesday which was during my stay. My family and I dined at the Village Seafood Buffet. Recently renovated, the entire dining area is attractive and well lighted, but somewhat crowded with tables closely spaced. Here again the staff were very friendly and offered outstanding service. Although the menu includes \u201clobster\u201d, don\u2019t expect a plump tail split open and steaming. The lobster is very tiny tails sliced in half and thrown into a steam pan. I had heard good things about the crab claws and lobster macaroni and cheese. Alas, these items were missing during my visit. I was very pleased with the fish, pasta and gelato selections. Overall, I found the quality of The Village Seafood Buffet to be much better than a typical Las Vegas buffet. But if you\u2019re objective is a quality seafood dinner, you\u2019d probably be better off at the Buzio\u2019s Seafood Restaurant. I also twice had breakfast at the Sao Paulo Caf\u00e9. I found the food to be of good quality and although not cheap, still a good value. I saw many, many families with small children at The Rio. Therefore, I think I should point out if you\u2019re looking for family entertainment, you will not find it at The Rio. In fact, you will not find it at any Las Vegas Casino. Although Las Vegas casinos promoted themselves as a family destinations back in the early 1990\u2019s, they quickly reversed this and are again adult destinations. Therefore, The Rio would serve as a nice place to stay, shop and dine for families seeking entertainment elsewhere in the Las Vegas area.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cbusy place\u201d", "Author": "bama39", "ReviewID": "UR91320249", "Content": "stayed 3 days at Rio and was so surprised the place was just packed xmas day from 3pm-midnight I'm guessing.

The room was spacious and had a plasma TV, another TV built into the bathroom mirror, jacuzzi tub and shower, coffee maker and both a bar fridge and another empty fridge for use. Word to the wise--don't touch anything in the bar fridge unless you really want it because the sensor will charge you right there. Fortunately the front desk took off the charge quickly when we told them nothing was taken from the fridge, The only downside of the room was staying during the big rainstorm and having a leak in one of the windows. It eventually covered a portion of the carpet in one corner but we didn't bother changing rooms as it didn't affect our stay at all.

Restaurants were all expensive and the Carnival World Buffet had a ridiculous lineup each day at almost any time of the day.

He tried to comp it, but the other bartender saw him and started yelling at him. I called him over and told him I would pay for it.

In our case, check-in was pretty good in the early evening. However, upon walk bys in the days ahead, the check-in line-ups were very long and slow. I asked if a complimentary upgrade was available and after what seemed a few minutes of silence and keyboarding clunking and a telephone call, we were told that an upgrade to the diamond room was available. It was recently renovated the clerk says, We were grateful to the clerk and wanted just to go to our rooms for some rest and a shower after a long flight. Our room is located on the 18th floor. As soon as I opened the door, I could see this was not the diamond suite, the room was not renovated, the carpet was really worn and run-down. You can see inground black stains. The door sensor was just dangling. The bed sheets were quite dated but clean. I went toward the old 26 inch tube tv and opened up the cabinet doors hiding it. I could smell an odd odour. I opened up the fridge and I seen a carton of milk with an expiry date of August 16. It was October 2!. I then looked further and noticed an old soup was in the fridge and it wasn't stocked. I called up the front desk and told them what happened. They didnt care. They just sent housekeeping up who were very quick and nice. I asked the cleaning lady if this room was remodelled recently and she said, no, it hasn't been remodelled at all. Later that evening I went to look for the clerk who gave us our room and she was really busy. There was a long line and I figured I would catch her the next day. Unfortunately, I never seen her again despite checking several different times every day for three days. The pool are is decent with one area of sand which gets really hot in the vegas sun. There was preparation for a band and the setup started around noon. There was no notice and the sound checks were terribly noisy and hurt my not very sensitive ears. There was no forewarning about the band or show, just a sign hidden away saying the pool will be closing early that day. We did enjoy the Voodoo Lounge and the hotel was giving away VIP passes every night. The Carnival in the sky was good as always and runs from Thursday to Sunday night. The Riu seems to have losts it's appeal in many ways. We did miss the strip and there is no benefit of staying at the Riu other than price, the reason we stayed there. Even then, I kinda wished we paid more and stayed elsewhere, but not at the PH (planet hollywood) since PH does NOT heat their pools for some absurb reason.

I learned from Trip Advisor before we left for the Rio, that I was to ask for an updated room. I did that. They told us that since our rooms had been reserved with a bunch of other for the convention, that we already had an updated room. So, that was nice. No hassle. Be aware every where in Vegas is a walk. That includes INSIDE your hotel as well. It was ridiculous. It took us almost 20 min to find our room. While on the way to finding our room we found tons of empty bottles (mostly corona) and garbage in the hallways. Not cool. Once we got to our room we were pleased. The view was nice. We could see all 3 pools. We were on the 12th floor. The room was clean. The bathroom was okay. It was clean just not really enough room for someone to sit on the toilet and have the door closed. Good luck if your tall. :( There were two refrigerators in our room which was also nice. One that was completely empty. Then one that was filled with food and drinks they want you to pay extremely high prices for. Btw, we learned that bottled water in Vegas is REALLY expensive. So, if you can find a place where you can get it for a reasonable price, then buy a BUNCH and put them in your empty fridge. That saved us some money. The bed was nice. The linens and such were nice linens. It was clean. They never have enough outlets around the bed to, say plug in your phone. For this room the plug was actually BEHIND the bed frame. Annoying. Anyone love moving a bed so you can plug in your phone? It was strange this room hardly had any outlets. I believe there were 3 in the room. Then others in the bathroom and sitting room. The maid service was polite and respected our wishes and never once came into our room, that we know of. They were always approachable and very nice. Now about the pools and the restaurants.... The main pool which is as big as the other two pools together, is not heated. FYI. My husband did not enjoy that pool as much. The pool that sits in the middle of the big pool and the other waterfall/beach(with sand) pool, is in the shape of a tropical fish which we thought was amusing. However in that pool.. since it was smaller and it was warmer but not clean!! It was kinda gross. You could see the sun block and tanning lotion floating on the top of the pool. :( We never did get to the third pool with the sand. It just looked dirty. Around the pool they had a couple of bars and little food stands.. which were all closed except one. Also, they had music playing over by the big pool. The music system consisted of 2 giant speakers. One which was centered in front of the big pool and then one that was pointing to the smaller pool in the center. Ours ( at the big pool) kept cutting out. They never got it fixed while I was there, it happened every 10 minutes. I was there for 4 days poolside during the day. It was really annoying. As for the \"casino\" restaurants, go somewhere else to eat!!! We went and had brunch at the sit down brunch cafe, called the Sao Paulo Cafe. I ordered a fresh \"oven fresh cinnamon roll\" which was 3.95. It was hard as a rock... the frosting on top was crusted over, I pushed my finger into it and it smashed down.. like it had been sitting out for ever. Not to mention they must have made them in muffin tins, cause they were shaped like muffins. It was GROSS! I had also order the Sao Paulo Combo - which was 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 sausage links, Breakfast potatoes, lightly buttered toast and preserves.. This was $16.99!!!! I was so disappointed. The eggs were overcooked. The pancakes were cold. I don't eat meat, so I asked for extra breakfast potatoes (which just turned out to be hashbrowns) that weren't cooked all the way through. Then their lightly buttered toast didn't actually have any butter on them, and the \"preserves\", were little plastic tubs of jelly. It was THE worst breakfast I had ever had. My husband ordered the potatoes, egg and cheese wrap. Which included a choice of bacon, sausage or ham. He chose sausage. This wrap shows up and it's HUGE. It was 9.99. It looked like it could be good, so he starts eating it. Within 10 min, he's complaining that he doesn't feel good and he couldn't eat anymore. He was then sick for half of the day and couldn't eat anything else. Coffee was HORRID, and the oj was really watered down. If you love GOOD food this place is not for you. Needless to say.. DON'T EAT HERE EVER!!!!! GROSS!!!! We mostly just stuck with food we knew at that point. Subway. It was cheaper, and WAY BETTER!!! Later on in the week we found out that his company was hosting a dinner party @ the famous Martorano's, which is also at the Rio casino. AMAZING! What a difference dining experience. We had 8 courses. It was amazing. If you are a vegetarian which I am, they really catered to my needs which was awesome. They had flat screen TV's all over the restaurant, playing Ocean's 11, which was cool. One veggie dish that I remember was their Eggplant Stack with mozzarella, tomato and arugula. OMG! OMG! I am drooling just thinking about it. My husband had the Tagliatelli Beef and Veal Bolognese \u2013 San Marzano tomatoes, fresh vegetables, touch of cream, finished with ricotta salata. I could recommend this place up and down!!!! It was fabulous! So, all in all the hotel was just okay. We didn't get to see the show in the sky that they offer to see for free cause we were there in the middle of the week and apparently they only have it on the weekends. Fri-Sun. Then we wanted to go to Penn and Teller, cause they do their magic show there and they were on \"vacation\". So, not shows. A little disappointed but not to much. I hate to say it, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.

Rio also offers a unique option at their 3 Card Poker tables that no one else has. I made money the first time I sat down to play. Room service was reasonable and the food was good. The grill downstairs serves delicious meals. (I did not try the deli). There are also mall type shops with additional options for grabbing a bite to eat. Not to mention the random entertainers that pop up now and then with a quick song or dance. Some of their bartenders put on a great juggling show using whatever is behind the bar or on the counter.

Registration to get my room took over an hour, and it was an off time on a weekday. I had called and confirmed the reservation a number of times and while the telephone staff were the best, the front desk were not. During rush times, checkout and 3 PM there were only 2 clerks working the desk and one was being trained! Train at OFF HOURS and free up someone who can get the guests moving in and out. The door keys DID NOT WORK. I now have a collection of 20 room keys as momentos. every time i went down they recoded the door and gave me two keys. One would work one would not, They even coded my Players card. NO GOOD either. To get the new keys i Would have to wait again, even at 2 AM. Finally a security guard offered to call someone but I was checking out in hours. The room was OKAY the bathroom needed major renovations, big time I hate showering with a trickle. Took me over an hour to find the refrigerator! The safe being a focal point in the room was a bad idea. Looks like it is calling out rob me robe me. After a few times, thinking i had lost my mind I realized the safe would lock when I coded it, but would automatically unlock a few hours later. It was NOT me The view of a roof top was not what was requested or promised with the room either. I went back to complain, and again an hour wait in line, and was told this is the room we have for you PERIOD. The evening NOISE from the pool area drifted, or screamed, to the room, so a quiet nights sleep was a dream not REALITY I am not a mid twenties individual and to have the pool mobbed by this age group with the music blaring at all hours from the pool and functions is more than inconvenient it is unacceptable. The hours are not convenient closing at 7 PM. What resort closes their pool at 7 when guests are off doing activities during the day. Scratch the POOL for children and adults (not post teens) Elevators kept breaking.. Not just one but a whole bank of them, more than once. Dining better save your money for this, not for the gaming. The buffet for dinner one night was horrible. One of us had ot go back three time to get a stir fry without sauce.. How simple is that. Every time the cook put on difference sauces. We ended up walking out with minimal satisfaction and ended up going for sandwiches a few hours later. NOT WORTH IT Breakfast was okay, expensive but at least it did not put us in debt. The Sports Deli was okay in price and quality but the staff turned us, and others around us, off. Abrupt and down right nasty. Could not gt a simple request right (no onions on something). I booked in advance the services at the Salon. The place looks nice, is miles from anything else and I went before the appointment to explain and ask if I can speak with the cosmatalogist.. Due to an unplanned demergency I had to change times and day of the appointmtnsand the yorked with me. The hair stylist was the best and she accomplished the look we discussed . I had to change the day of the make up and when I went the woman was okay, and I explained I needed some discolorations covered for special photos. Afterward I was dressing and did not think to check it out, butevery picture I am in has every mark shining like a bright light. The most imporatant day of my life and i look like a marquee with the discolorations. these pictures will be seen for decades and there i am looking like I have the pox. Mineral makeup is NOT COVERAGE. Then to make it worse--- I was quoted, three times the cost and when I went to pay I was told it was over 20 dollars more and the tip was automatically 10% !!!!!!! I signed, no choice, then asked for a copy of the receipt and i was told it would be on my bill!!!!!! Check out took over an hour as well!!!! The three pluses: the bell man department was great The drivers for the shuttle bus to the other properties The dealers at 7 AM ( the afternoon and evening were very droll at the various tables). I requested on this web site a copy of my bills, and this was a week ago... Still no bill. I am calling in a few minutes to get the General Manager to discuss these issues. I have been a guest at Harrah's properties, in many states, for over 15 years.

I have stayed at this hotel in the past with my husband, and was happy with our stay. But, I have to say since our last stay about 5 years ago the hotel has gone downhill. The rooms are very dated, and need some upgrades and improvements...the bathrooms are very old and run down. ROOMS~Masqurede tower--Upon walking into our room we realized we had a lovely view of the parking lot...but a side view to the strip-We first noticed that the windows were horribly dirty. Streaks ran down the glass and really was not very appealing at all. In our bathroom, the shower barely worked and the faucet was falling off the tub surround and leaked. The first night we were there we also realized our safe did not work. We called maitenance and they sent someone up who told us the safe was now fixed. Unfortunately, after he left, we went to put our items back in the safe, but the safe still did not work. It was not due to user error either...The safe was BROKEN and the digital reader light was once again off after he had gotten it to work. We had dinner reservations, so we had to leave and were unable to secure our items. We were very upset. No one else ever showed up again to fix the safe and we went all weekend without using it and had to hide our valuables in our locked luggage. POOL~The next afternoon we spent by the pool and although it is a lovely pool area, the service was horrible. Not once did a bar server come by and ask any of us or the other guests around us if we wanted anything. We had to get our own drinks all afternoon. This really needs some attention. The only people getting service were in the bikini beach area where you pay to get in. They really need to take care of their other guests who choose not to hang out in the 20-something party area. MAID SERVICE~We had been by the pool all day Sunday and were ready to come up to the room, relax a bit and take a nice shower to get ready for the evening and upon entering our room at at 4:30 pm our room was still not made up! We were actually shocked. I have traveled extensively with my husband domestically as well as internationally and I have never NOT received maid service. We called the desk, and although they did apologize and bring towels up right away for us, they never did come and clean our room-UNACCEPTABLE! RESTAURANTS~We had the highlight of our stay at the RIO at Cafe Martorano's restaurant -after having horrible service in the hotel, I have to say we had a fantastic dinner here. The friend who invited us used to work for Harrahs and was very familiar with the menu, so we let him choose what we would be having. He chose a nice selection of appetizers and entrees for us to share \"family style.\" Everything we tried was delicious! The eggplant appetizer was just delicious!! The meatballs were great too and I'm not a huge meatball fan. The veal was also great! The wine was delicious and our server was awesome!! The music was fun and upbeat! All American grill~service was good and food was great! Buffet~Had the brunch buffet one morning and the service was really good and the food selection was excellent. Too much food for us, but overall a really nice buffet if your into them! ;) Yummy peel and eat shrimp! VOODOO LOUNGE~Had the oppurtunity to go up to the 51st floor and have a few drinks at voodoo lounge. The night we were there they had a DJ outside and it was pretty packed up there. So many people it was pretty impossible to dance and the music was not very good. The view, however, is amazing!! All in all, I have to say that this...BY FAR....is my worst hotel experience in my life. Like I stated I have traveled alot and I'm not incredibly picky as long as the basics are covered. However, this trip there was way too many mistakes made by the staff in the hotel and the quality of the rooms is really not acceptable for the price they charge a night...especially since it is so far from the strip. I can honestly say this is the first NEGATIVE review I have ever left for a hotel. I mean, there can be things here and there that need improvement, but generally there is not this many problems. Unfortunately, this was the exception. far too many problems, lack of service and due to that my review of the RIO is DO NOT STAY HERE!!

There were many negative reviews about the Rio so I didn't know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. It is an older hotel but our room was on the 8th floor and spacious and very clean. We did not wait at check-in and our room was ready and we were there at 11 am. The refridgerater in the room is a plus. We never waited long for the shuttle to or back from the Strip. The buffet lines were usually long but we didn't care beause we are not buffet people. Reviewers claimed that the casino was dark but we found the Mirage to be darker. We did OK gambling there and the service was good. The pool area was a good size and clean. There were quite a few families with children there also. If you're looking for a decent place at a low price the Rio is a good bet. I say that you get what you pay for, so if you want more and willing to pay then go to TheHotel, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, or Ceasars. Please don't compare the Rio to them. Would I go back??

Having both worked in the hospitality industry, we're more than polite and patient with most hotel and restaurant staff we encounter. We usually overlook the minor problems and just go with the flow, choosing instead to relax and enjoy our vacation. But our most recent visit to the Rio tested us to the limit. Having stayed for a long weekend several months before, we knew not to expect luxury or 5-star service. Upon checking in for a four-night stay, we stepped into the well-worn room we expected but were immediately overcome with the overwhelming stench of cigar smoke. We called the front desk right away to report the problem and requested a new room. The indifferent clerk told us there was nothing else available. (Hard to believe in a mega resort during the off season.) He did send housekeeping to \"deodorize\" the room, which resulted in the even more unbearable stench of cleaner masking smoke. After spending the night in one of the single most uncomfortable hotel beds I've ever experienced (every spring made its presence known), we stopped by the front desk the next morning to again request a new room. When we were again told that wasn't possible, we asked if we could pay for a room upgrade. We just wanted to enjoy our stay. Not particularly concerned, the front desk told us to check back in three hours after they were sure all VIPs were accommodated for the evening. (We are well aware we're not VIPs, but it was still rather odd to have that pointed out by the staff.) We proceeded to check with the front desk four more times over the next 24 hours, each time being told to come back several hours later. After spending a second night in this subpar room and being turned away again by the front desk, I went back to the room, called guest relations, and insisted that we be moved. I didn't want to be THAT guest, but the Rio's staff didn't leave us much choice. We were finally moved from our king room to a newer double-double -- disappointing, but at least the beds allowed for a decent night's sleep. We've had some OK times at the Rio, and I really do want to like this place. It's not without its good points. The casino is fun, and the Show in the Sky is entertaining the first time or two. The buffet is decent, and the iBar makes a good spot to meet traveling companions. The free shuttle bus to the Strip helps mitigate the remote location (although it doesn't run late). And, of course, Harrah's no-resort-fee policy is a plus. But the Rio's rooms need a major renovation, no matter where you are in the hotel something always seems to be broken, and the staff, while not rude, are among the most unhelpful and indifferent we've experienced in Las Vegas. Saving a few bucks is nice, but where the Rio is concerned, it's just not worth it. Spend a little more -- even if it means paying those MGM-Mirage resort fees -- and choose your favorite 4-star on the Strip. You'll have a far better experience and enjoy more of the fun that Vegas has to offer. Final tip, though, if you do stay at the Rio: Gaylord Indian Restaurant was a fantastic lunch choice one day. Wonderful service, charming atmosphere, and far better-than-expected food for a decent price. It's well-worth a visit.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago,il", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel and over good Vegas experience\u201d", "Author": "argonauts52", "ReviewID": "UR79083972", "Content": "Rio is off the strip, but it is a 20 min walk, $12 cab ride, or 1/2 hour free shuttle to the strip.

First pool is filled with kids, hot tubs needed a good cleaning, second pool feels like bathwater with nothing special in it, third pool was the best, but cold and the 4th pool you have to pay to get into. It was in the back secluded for free female entrance but males had to pay $20 to get in. Water tasted funny as well like it was salty or something.

I arrived late on a Tuesday night and stood in line behind several other people. There were two clerks working check in but it seemed to be a slow process. While checking in, I was advised that my room was being upgraded, which I did not expect at a $49 per night rate. Anyway, I received directions to the room and found that I had a 1600 sq. foot suite with 180 degrees of floor to ceiling windows. It was a huge room with a dining room, living room, bedroom, and two bathrooms. The master bath had two vanities, a whirlpool, and a separate shower all done in marble.

Since I don\u2019t gamble, I didn\u2019t use the casino although you have to walk through it to get to everything. The Rio has a good sized pool area but it was crowded during the day and closes at 6 pm. Most hotels in Vegas close the pools at night to get people in the casino, given the hot weather, I believe they should be open much later. There are a variety of restaurants on the property. They tend to be crowded at lunch when conventions are on-site. I didn\u2019t have time to wait in line so I bought a wrap from a take out counter near the casino. It had been sitting awhile and was pretty soggy. I ate one night at the seafood buffet, which is supposed to be highly acclaimed. I found it to be mediocre. The crab legs were snow crab instead of king crab, the shrimp were small, and I didn\u2019t see any lobster. The gelato, however, was very good.

Stayed for 4 days/3 nights, and the housekeeping did a great job of cleaning and replacing all of the toiletries. Even honored our request to leave extra towels on the 2nd day.

All things considered, an extremely small complaint. Overall, the room was fantastic, and we would definitely stay there again! We ate at the Sao Paulo Cafe for breakfast twice, and the food was excellent! The servers were a little slow and not very personable, but we were there to eat, not to make friends. LOL! We also ate at the Carnival World Buffet as part of the Buffet of Buffets package. Ate there for dinner, and the selections are vast! Especially liked the dessert counter in the middle. Nice selection of gelato! The casino area is huge, and there is something for everyone. Blackjack table minimums were a little higher than I would have liked, but had fun at every table I played at. There is also just about every slot machine that you can imagine! (Except I couldn't fine the Lucky Penny Bright Diamonds machine!) We made use of valet parking, and the self-parking garage.

Worst of all, we had booked a special \"package\" for our three-day stay, pre-paying nearly double the normal room rate in order to get what sounded in the description like full access, 24 hours, to seven buffets, at the Rio and 6 other affiliated hotels. We'd figured that we wouldn't have to budget for food during our stay, having paid in advance for access to all these buffets. Problem was, nobody knew how this was supposed to work. We asked the clerk at check-in how it worked and he vaguely showed us a coupon that printed out with our check-in papers, and said we needed to show that to the cashier. We tried using that at Caesar's (one of the affiliated hotels) and were greeted with puzzled looks but after a consultation with another employee, we were given bright blue paper wrist bands and ushered into the buffet. The buffet itself was nice, but after eating, we didn't want to wear those paper wrist bands and so we took them off (nobody had told us otherwise). Next morning, we tried to get in to the breakfast buffet at Rio and were told that without the wrist bands they wouldn't let us in. The cashier pointed to the small print on the wrist band that said \"void if removed,\" which nobody had told us before.

So we did, and he basically told us it was too bad but we were only allowed one 24-hour access period to the buffets during our 3-day stay, and to use it we had to keep wearing those paper wrist bands, even to shower. I mentioned that our reservation had cost us nearly twice as much because the advertising sounded as if we paid the extra amount in order to get buffet access during our entire stay, and he said, sorry, but it's only one 24 hour period. He did finally agree to let us go to the buffet that morning without the magic paper wristband (after I pointed out that even if what he said was right, we were still within the 24-hour period that apparently had begun the day before at Caesar's). When we went back to the cashier for the buffet, she said we would not believe the number of people who had complained about that very same thing, all of us mislead in the same way. By the way, you can buy that 24-hour access to the buffets once you arrive there, for only $39.99. We paid roughly 4 times that.

As usual I have both good and bad comments but overall we enjoyed the experience and will go back. My wife and I have been to Las vegas over 40 times and have stayed at many hotels. The GOOD: We enjoyed the pools. They are salt water so no strong chemicals. The pools were clean. We had no problem finding lounge chairs (unlike the Mirage) and there were many shady and private spots. I wish they would stay open past 6:00 PM. I also find the pools a little shallow at 4 ft. maximum. The music was a little loud and occaisionally jungle thumping rap crap but overall not bad. GOOD: The room was spacious, clean and the beds were comfortable. We had a mini fridge which was great to keep beer, milk and oranges cool. The room had floor to ceiling windows which needed cleaning but I know in Vegas that would have to be done daily to keep all the sand off them. Just live with it. The view of the strip was great. GOOD: The location is actually very easy to get to and from the strip. We always rent a car but they had a shuttle available which runs you to Bill's (corner Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd.). It seemed to run frequently. It is too far to walk to the strip especially in the heat. POOR: The buffet used to be good years ago when Tony Marnell owned the Rio but it has really slipped in quality. A good deal is the $39.95 24 hour pass which allows you to use Ceasars, Paris, Flamingo etc. We found the buffet at Caesars very good. If you buy it late one day you can go for dinner, breakfast and again for dinner the next day. POOR: We found most dealers were good but there is always one with attitude. This trip we ran into one who I won't name here but have communicated to the casino manager. She is from Yugoslavia and you will definitely notice her if you play the table games. She not only made mistakes but was bad attitude and agressive the whole time. Just nasty. She very quickly cleared the table which was too bad because everyone was having fun until she arrived. If they don't like their job they should quit. There are THOUSANDS of people waiting to take their job. How the casinos don't screen them out better I don't understand since this is a tough market for them. We made lots of money and left immediately when she arrived so RIO never got a chance to make their money back and I sure don't feel sorry for them!! Sweet revenge!!

The \"adventure\" began as I was checking in - an obviously distraught woman came up to the desk in tears because her room had been broken into and security wasn't responding. Not a pleasant way to begin a vacation! My first room had a great view of the Strip but it also had a connecting door to the adjacent room where some noisy people were staying. Every sound they made came right through the door, making it impossible to sleep. After the first night I asked to switch rooms. I was given a lesser quality room at the back of the hotel with no view, but at least it was quieter. The worst thing about the Rio is the pool area. They advertise 4 pools, but don't be fooled! The first pool is for little kids (it has a small sandy beach). The 2nd and 3rd pools are available for adults but they are crowded and the water is filthy. I'm not sure if their filtration system was broken or maybe they don't even have one, but there was all kinds of stuff floating in the water and it was never cleaned out the entire week I was there. The 4th pool, the really nice one, has a big bamboo fence all around it and you have to pay an entrance fee to use it, even if you're already a hotel guest...unbelievable! But the worst thing is the music. The 4th pool plays incredibly loud, ugly rap music all day long and it booms throughout the entire pool complex. It was like being caught in an artillery bombardment. I tried sitting in different areas but it was impossible to escape the noise. Also, the Rio is located off the Strip. They offer free shuttle service to Harrah's and Bally's but you may have to wait 25-30 minutes for the shuttle to show up. And if it's busy you may not be able to get on the first shuttle, which means waiting another 25-30 minutes. The walk from the Rio to the Strip isn't bad - only about 20 minutes - but it's along a busy highway with no shade, making it a miserable experience in August.

It is about 1 mile west of the Bellagio but seems farther. You have to cab to the strip as otherwise you are walking over a freeway overpass in a high traffic area. Cab ride costs about $12 to pretty much anywhere on the strip. There are free separate shuttles to and from the Rio to Harrah's and Bally's. However, sometimes you may have to wait up to a half hour so not really worth it. If you are playing in multiple world series of poker events this is a great place to stay. I otherwise would not recommend it. In my opinion, the strip is a better place to stay and the price at the Rio isn't much different than a comparable strip hotel. The pool is nice however and it has a wading pool with sand for kids. I've heard good things about the voodoo lounge on top of the rio but did not get up there. The restaurant options are decent and the sports book is good. The Rio has kind of a party atmosphere. However, I was disappointed in the cost of table games. They had no $5 tables and even $10 was hard to find at times. The rooms are large and fairly modern but nothing special. The mattress was comfortable. The rooms are fairly close to the main lobby unlike many strip hotels. If you want to use the fitness center, it costs $22 per day. In terms of tips, ask for a room with a strip view. Not much to see out to the west. If you player poker, ask for the poker rate. You may be able to get a room for as little as $25 a night or less on weekdays. If you want to get away from the strip, Red Rocks Canyon and the Hoover dam are both great places to visit. ------------------------------------- http://www.hooverdamtours.org", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel off the strip\u201d", "Author": "adz1983", "ReviewID": "UR70169708", "Content": "I was really impressed with the hotel and the Casino.

The top issue is safety - And I say this because, as mentioned elsewhere, during our stay the alarm went off several times, including 5:30 AM one morning. So, how reliable is the alarm system?. Also, on our floor I had the occasion to try to use the house phones near the elevators - Both phones were not working - What happens in an emergency? Even though we had an older room, and the carpet was a little frayed - Overall it was a nice room - Especially for the price. It was clean, and was mostly in great shape. The size was great, the sofa and 2 chair desk/table were really useful for relaxing and eating. It was nice to spend time in the room. We were on a lower floor, but the view of the strip was fantastic. The beach/pool was nice and big - Great place to hang out and relax. The staff were all great over the 5 days we were there - All of them. The restaurants left much to be desired - We rented a car, and traveled to local restaurants, The car paid for itself in this respect. Though we did eat in the hotel. I think the best for the buck was the American Grill - We had a couple of great burgers and BLT's there. The fast food Chinese place near check-in was a disaster (people were even throwing out their meals). The Sao Paulo was OK for breakfast (though pricey). I liked the fridge in the room - It was in addition to the wet bar, and was big enough for drinks and snacks. There is a grocery store two blocks down Valley Rd (Called Greengrocers if I recall). It was a nice place to stock up on sodas, juices, milk and snack foods.. The casino was (to me) the classic casino - Big, fair returns even on the slots - We liked it even better than the Palms (that was puny is size compared to the Rio). And it was a laid-back type of place - nice people there . This is really the middle-America working class type of people - A nice mixed group (ethnically), all pleasant people. Not the wannabe celebrities you would find at some of the places on the strip, nor the seedy types in some of the lower-end casinos. Everyone seemed happy here. And the floor shows were nice - With the boats floating around the ceiling - Everyone enjoyed that. The VooDoo lounge was a great suprise - That is a must-do. We went there about sundown, before it got crowded, and it was a spectacular view (it has an outdoor patio on the 51st floor). Though the drinks were expensive, the staff there was so hospitable and the view so great, we did not mind. This hotel is a good value all around. Renting a car is a good idea - The aprking was easy and convenient here. Another gripe though is the Business Center, and Internet access. The charges wee a little steep at the business center - So avoid this service if you can. I can understand charging for the Internet - To discourage people from hanging around all day on it.

We stayed in room 1763 in the Ipanema Tower, non smoking room, king bed. Clean, roomy, comfortable bed, quiet, all items in room worked, including internet service. We both liked the idea of having a refrigerator and have noted how much it would suck to not have that at other properties. We just like to have water, pop and juice close by and not pay vending machine prices for those kinds of items. We had a car and bought items for the room at Wal-Mart. The Rio has plenty of restarant chioices, we ate at the Buffet, you will be stuffed, we ate at All American Grill, that was average but ok. Room service for breakfast was very good and reasonably priced. Breakfast at San Paulo Cafe was good as well. Had a lunch at McFaddens, again nothing to write home about but we are not food critics, we just wanted a bite to eat and that's what we got. I read too many reveiws about food, is that what people go to Las Vegas for, food ? Go to France if you want food and if you want really good food, then expect to pay for it. Our room was $109 a night for Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, I think given the great rate we had exceptional value. I booked the room via the phone 6 months in advance. Rio has a great pool area and really tasty food and drinks served to you. Table games were good, slots were a little on the tight side, we are not big time gamblers. I would recommed using the text system they employ for some good discounts, send your text 48 hours before you depart, go to Total Rewards Center in the Rio to redeem. Again, I don't know there are so many negative reviews on here, the Rio is still a really nice property with good service and in a good location, the place is 20 years old and in places looks a little worn but for the most part it's what it has been for all these years a really fun experience.

The room itself was very clean, although the hallways were frequently littered with room service leftovers that still needed to be cleaned up. One con to our our room was that it was overlooking the trash pickup section in the back of the hotel. All night long we could hear workers seperating trash and recycling (glass bottles breaking and smashing all night long). And trucks would come in and park there for pickups/deliveries starting at about 3-4 in the morning and not turn their engines off. (We stayed in the Ipanema section.) There is a shuttle that takes you to the strip (to Paris/Ballys and another one that I believe went to Caesar's) that runs every half an hour. The lines are always very long for the shuttle, but convenient if you do not have a car or don't want to spend the money on a taxi. We had a car on this trip and had no problem getting around and finding parking spots at other casinos/hotels. If I stayed at the Rio again, I would get a car and not mess with the shuttles. The casino is lacking in game variety. And the \"Show in the Sky\" was cheesy. It was also rather racy - don't let your kids see it! I had a hot stone massage in the spa and it was so relaxing, although much more expensive than I'd spend on a similar experience back at home.

But, we were told that these rooms had NOT been redecorated--an understatement for sure. The rooms are truly in need of a detailed cleaning if they are not to be redecorated soon. Accumulated dirt was everywhere you looked, especially where the carpet meets the walls and on the big couch. The shower head was almost falling off and the toilet had to be flushed twice each time it was used. Definitely a lack of maintenance here. We went down to the pool once, to find that one pool was closed and the others were seriously overcrowded. The waterfalls were all shut off, and one pool was very cloudy with lots of junk floating in it. Not too attractive. Glad we didn't catch anything. On the flip side, the towels and sheets were always clean and the maid seemed to do an above-average job each day. The BIG plus was that we were able to get the rooms at only $40 per night. Maybe we shouldn't be so picky at that price, but I'm sure the Rio can do better. We have stayed there before and the rooms were in much better condition.

Well when we went to check in we were told they did not have to honor what was done on the internet and the room charge was going to be more than what was quoted. Speaking with a manager was useless. They are rude and ignorant! Well getting past this issue there was then as everyone has complained about was the $100.00 deposit.

We had to decide whether to go cheap and off strip or spend a little more to be right in the action. The Rio seemed like a good compromise. Not on the Strip, but there is a free shuttle, and it has all the amenities of the Strip casinos: shows, restaurants, pool ,etc. Well, we just got home from our trip and I can safely say that next time we'll splurge for something more central. I have no idea if check in went well, since I waited in the car. The room was very nice, but we were disappointed to be in the older Ipanema tower that faces the suburbs instead of the Strip. The buffet ... was a buffet. We were excited at the prospect of so many different kinds of cuisine, but you couldn't eat enough to justify the price. Not that you'd want to eat that much - the food was luke warm and mediocre. I'd rather pay for a little good food than a lot of bad food. But many people feel differently - there was a half-hour wait just to get in the door. We got a great coupon book at check in, so we used it for 2-for-1 tickets to that night's Penn and Teller show. The show was great and we got to meet the magicians afterward. Our P&T tickets also got us free admission to th VooDoo Lounge. The view from the Lounge is incredible - 51 stories up looking out over the Strip. There was a flair bartender and he gave a generous pour, so it made up for the jaw-dropping prices. The Lounge would have been amazing except that there was a private party going on. Every single table and chair was reserved, as well as the entire lower deck of the balcony. There was nowhere to sit and standing in heels gets tiresome after an hour or so. Why wouldn't they just close the club if every single table is reserved? We ate at the Sao Paulo Cafe for breakfast. The food was amazing, the service was not. The little basket of jam on our table was empty, so I reached over to an empty table and snagged a few packets of strawberry. The server arrived to check us just then and demanded to know what I was doing. When I said \"Getting some jam,\" she walked over to another table, grabbed a full basket, slammed it down on our table and said, \"There - was that so hard?\" When we got the check, we didn't know if (since we were charging it to the room) if we needed to wait or we could just leave our room info. When the server returned, we asked politely how to handle the check. She gave a disgusted sigh and snatched it up and said, \"I'll just do it myself.\" Turns out we just had to hand it to the hostess on the way out the door. She could have just told us that without the drama. We didn't eat any other meals at the Rio, but I did have a similar experience with a cocktail waitress. The policy I've adopted in casinos is to tip the waitress if I ordered more than one drink, or if the service was exceptional. My friend and I had been gambling about forty minutes before we were approached about drinks. She returned with my drink, which took another half-hour and was extremely watered down. I said thank you, but she just stood there and stared at me. I thought she was cleaning up a spill on the tray, but after she finished she just kept staring. I again said, \"thank you,\" to which she rolled her eyes and said, \"Fine then\" and stormed off. I have worked in food service for years, so I am typically a very good tipper. But the service was slow and the drink was terrible. And standing there expectantly while you sigh and roll your eyes is in no way professional. When we returned home, we discovered that we had been overcharged nearly $200 for the Penn and Teller tickets, and about $75 at the iBar in the lobby. When I called the Rio, I was told that no one in customer service was available. I demanded to talk to someone in charge and was connected with a front desk manager, who apologized and refunded the tickets immediately. However, when I spoke to someone in food and beverage services about the bar charges, they gave me excuse after excuse and said that someone would call me the next day. It has been three days and I have still been unable to get a hold of anyone and we have not been refunded. On top of this, the \"Show in the Sky\" was closed, we were ignored for half an hour at the Irish bar before we finally just left, and arrived at Caesar's for the Rio shuttle (which they are still advertising) only to be told they don't offer the service any more.

When I got up to checkin the person next to me got a 6th floor room so I tried the $20 sandwich trick and got a corner room in the IP tower (room 1223) with a full view of the strip and of the pool. The room was a very good size with the king bed. I read complaints about the TV and I also had a 27\" CRT but I was not there to watch TV anyway so no big deal. The casio was not as smokey as other people claimed too. But after coming to Vegas every couple of years for the last 20, the town in general seemed much better than years ago. I was concerned about the walk to the strip but from the sports book at Rio to the sports book at Caesear's it took me only 23 minutes which was not bad at all.

I am glad I was able to get a bet on the Celtics over Cleveland as it almost paid for my entire trip. :) The new buffet deal they have for $35 for all you can eat in 24 hours is a good deal but I think the food quality has went down since the last time I had the buffets at the Rio, Caesars and Harrah's buffets.

Maid service was good and very friendly. All four of us found the beds to be very comfortable.Their was a tray left out in the hall one room down for the first 12 hours were were there. The casino is dark but ok, nothing special. Comments about the smoke, not much more then any other casino and I was with 3 sensitive non-smokers we were not bothered by it. There was a long line for the buffet when we arrived. We only ate at the buffet once and that was for breakfast-once again it was ok. The deal at most LV buffet's is, all you can eat, all day for $40. We did have a lunch buffet at Mandalay bay for $20, it was excellent and I highly recommend it. Great food, service and atmosphere my adult step-daughter called it classy, almost like you were in a movie. If you like Mexican food, go to Diablos, it is right on the strip, next to the Monte carlo-best steak burrito. Pool is very nice, didn't get to enjoy too much as it was really windy. Went to see Penn and teller, I am not a big fan but it was a good show and worth seeing. Also saw Peepshow, I thought it was really good I liked it. A word of warning, a lot of topless dancing, ok with me but maybe not with everyone. Ask for complementary passes to Voddoo lounge at check-in they have a bunch, it is a fantastic view and cool club. They had 2 dj's one inside and the other outside. Show in the sky is cool, but it is more of a sing and dance on a stage. TH-Sun, on the hr every hr starting at 7pm to midnight. The 7 and 8pm show is crowded then after that not much people. IBAR at the center of the casino is cool they have these touch screen flat video table games which my wife and step-daughter really enjoyed, drinks are expensive though. The elevators were fast and not crowded. Hotel is off the strip but we had a rental car so that was no problem, there is a shuttle to harrahs and ballys on the strip. My recommendation of this hotel is just ok-nothing special. I have only stayed at a couple of hotels in LV. The Rio is better then Circus Circus but not as good as Planet Hollywood.

Sea food buffet, not a sea food eater, but my husband ate his 40 dollars worth of crab! Then we went to register and was told they do not except debit cards, unless we paid them upfront 100.00 a night security deposit! I had paid with this same debit card on line to purchase the rooms. Very upset as i had budgeted so much for room and entertainment, i was going to leave, even though i would have to forfeit a nights room fee. The young lady spoke to the manager, he would discount to 50.00 a night, we would have to pay this fee so we could charge food or drink to our room. I was not planning to charge anything to the room! So in the end, i had to pay cash for the next night, and would have it returned and they then would take the debit card!!!! Lets see, no cable in the rooms, because the wind supposedly knocked down the satellite . No coffee maker in the room because that was only for VIP rooms! There was a breeze coming thru the window, had to turn up the heat to warm the room up. The prices were so high for room service 10.00 for two eggs and toast, with a 2.50 charge per order! And the slots, i have always enjoyed nickel and penny machines as i can play for hours with 20 or 30 dollars, you had to put in 2 to 3 dollars a spin to cover all the lines, in order to win anything worth winning. Didn't see many winning anything. And the choice of slots majority were dollar machines and none of the old classic slots like Betty boo machines.

But I got a great last minute rate so I booked the Rio and we were glad we stayed here! We have been to Vegas many times and have stayed at many hotels/casinos and even time share units. This was one of our best experiences. I will try to tell as much as I can here: We stayed 4/19 - 4/23 on the 12th floor of the Impanema building. Our room faced the rear of the hotel looking towards the moutains and the Gold Coast and Plams casinos. The room was much bigger than most casino hotel rooms. The view was awesome! The bathroom had seperate sinks, one in the toilet/shower area and one outside of it. It did have a mini fridge and the mini bar. It also had a fold out couch, desk and chair and 2 benches by the foot of the beds (we had 2 queens). The beds were very comfortable as were the pillows. The windows were floor to ceiling and covered the whole outside wall! They had really good drapes that close tight for a good dark room at night, or the daytime. That is real important for me because I am a light sleeper. We both slept really well at the Rio. The room was very clean and the maid did a great job. I did tip her$4-$5/day. The only negs were, no coffee maker, no free wireless, we booked a king room but they were sold out so we got 2 queens...no big deal. The pool: Awesome and very clean. We only had good weather 1 day so my wife loved it. It has like 4 pools and some water falls, sand beach area, palm trees, bar and food service area. It was a great pool but too bad we could only enjoy it 1 day. The weather turned into the 40's and 50's the next 2 days with rain and even hail. So we hit the casinos and did other touristy stuff. The casino: Very friendly dealers and service people. The waitresses are very talented and break into song or dance at these small stage areas throught the casino. Cute too!! Drinks came around pretty frequently, not like the recommended Gold Coast next door. The Food: We only ate at the Carnival World buffet and it was outstanding. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about. We both loved this buffet. Talk to the locals, it is one of the best buffets in Vegas. We did the buffet pass for $29. You get 7 different buffets to eat at 7 casinos and you can try them as many times as tou can handle in 24 hours. Well, we can't eat that much, but think about it......we had our first dinner at 7 PM, then breakfast at 8:30 AM, then lunch at 1PM and then dinner again at 6:30 PM. All at the Rio, but we had 4 great meals for $29 each! Dinner buffet had great Asian, Mexican, sushi, sliced beef, sliced roast pork, sald bar, soups, pastas, pizza, chicken, fish, veggies, potatoes, fish, pell and eat and fried shrimp, all you can eat crab legs, ice cream/gellato bar, deserts and much much more. The buffet is huge and there wasn't much that we didn't enjoy. Breakfast has the omelet bar and all kinds of cereals, pancakes and anything that even kids would love. In fact, we plan to bring ours here the next time! The only other time we ate at the Rio was for a late night sandwich at the sports betting area. It was pretty good but like I said, it was only late night bar grub so how can you screw that up? VooDoo lounge: We didn't party there or eat at the VooDoo steakhouse, we just went up to check out the view. INCREDIBLE!! You gotta see this at night! Recommendations: Rental car, Compact 4 door for $23/day on carrentals.com. Last year we got a cool mustang for $10/day. We drive to other casinos on our own. Park at the valet and tip a couple bucks when you come out! Simple and easy too. Freemont St.: One of our favs. Souveneer shops, bars, older cool casinos, cheap gambling ($2 & $3 tables at Fitzgeralds and others). Neat covered street that does a light show on the canopy at night. Millions of light bulbs dance around to loud music playing. They do it like every hour or so. $1.99 shrimp cocktail at one of the places. Just like the old days at the Dunes! It was good too! Pawn Star shop: Right off Freemont street is the Pawn store that has the TV show on the histroy channel. We went in there and got pics and souvineers for the kids (and me)! Shopping Malls: The wife likes the Town square south of the strip and then the mall right at Planet Hollywood casino. I could give a crap about shopping but she can shop and I can play at PH (I love that casino, I seem to do well there and drinks come around often) Eats: Many places but this time we tried Cabo Wabo at the mall by Planet Hollywood (really good especially the coconut margarita). The steak house at NewYorkNewYork (name escape me, famous place out east) was outstanding. Pricey but really good. Emirils at MGM, sushi place at MGM, House of Hash, a few miles off strip for a great breakfast and bloodies, Todai Aisain buffet is pretty good, and almost any sandwich place at NYNY. Casinos: Check out Bellagio for the beauty, flowers, gardens, blown glass (sounds kinds femmy I know, but pretty cool) NYNY is awesome, we love that place. They make the shop/bar area look like streets in old New York city. It's pretty neat. Mandalay Bay: House of Blues!!, Shark tank, the best pool area. Stratosphere: Older and not too flashy but great drink service (while playing) and for some reason we seem to do well plaiying here. Scary rides at the top for kids or daredevils (not me!) Freemont St.: Golden Nugget is older but pretty cool. Many older casinos but chraper to play. Slots O Fun Casino: It's real small and next to CircusCircus. Nothing special but just a fun place! $2 Heinekin bottles if you just wanna have a few! I did well at roulette there. The Asian lady dealer with short hair is a riot! Day drives/trips: We did the Grand Canyon airplane tour a few years back for like $400/person. It was expensive for us but really worth it! Hoover Dam: Neat once or twice, take the rental car! Valley of Fire: Not too far away, awesome colored mountains, we really liked it. Ski resort: the name escapes me.(charelston?) but maybe 11/2 hour drive up in the mountains. It was a lot cooler up there when it was about 95 on the strip a few years back. Food and bar up there with nice views. Websites: Check out cheapovegas.com, as recommended on this webite earlier. I booked the Rio there for $53/night avg, for the time we stayed. It was last minute so I guess that is why it was so cheap, they directed me to I4vegas.com to book it. Carrentals.com if you plan on renting one. I like thrifty rental although they show you choices for many companies. alligiantair.com They're hub is Vegas. We fly from the midwest either out of Rockford IL, or Appleton, WI. This time we got a $69 to Vegas and $129 return. Not too bad! Check flight prices often because they do change. People watch!! There are all kinds walking around the strip, especially at night! All kinds of weirdos!! Elvis and Michael Jackson impersonators letting you take pics with them for a buck or two. Shows: Go to the booth either on Freemont St. of at the Hawaiin market next to Planet Hollywood. It is called something like 1/2 price tickets, or something like that. They have last minute ticket deals for many shows and events, if you don't have tickets to anything. The help there knows what shows are good too. We are mid forties and love comedy. But the Cirque du Solie are outstanding (except Chris angel) We relly liked Love, KA, O, Terry Fator, and Michael Johns hypnotist show at the Tropicana. (dirty fun, cheaper than most shows, use the 2for1 coupon in coupon books). Blue Man group and other shows I may as well not name because they are no longer there. Just OK shows were: Chris Angel, Amazing Jonathon (he seems bored), Jubilee, and Menopause (we heard it was fantastic. there are only 4 ladies in the whole show and they really are good, but it just wasn't for me. My wife liked it better but it still seemed like it was for a 50's plus crowd). We liked the Rio so much, we plan to take our 3 kids (13-19 yrs old) the next time for a family vacation. We will stay at the Rio (if the price is decent) for a few days and then drive to LA to check that out. If you have smaller kids, you may consider Circus Circus. I talked to many people staying there and they loved it.

The lady and I visit Las Vegas quite often, driving up from Phoenix, and we\u2019re continuing our endless pursuit to stay in every hotel on the strip. This time, it was the lady\u2019s birthday so she got to choose. Away we go to the Rio. We had frequented the Rio because they have the best dinner buffet in the entire town in my opinion, but this was the first time we had actually stayed there. This further ensured that we wouldn\u2019t be getting away from the hotel much\u2026after you\u2019re that full, what else is there to do but sleep? Parking at the Rio isn\u2019t bad if you\u2019re driving, they have the standard parking garage as you\u2019ll find with most hotels on the strip. The elevator from the parking garage will take you to the main floor where the check in counter in right in the middle between the front door and rear entrance. Check-in was swift and very friendly. The gentleman at the counter offered a room upgrade, as they usually will to squeeze some more dough out of you, we declined the upgrade but the gentleman was nice enough to offer a corner room. The corner room was not only a bit larger than the standard room, but there were two walls with floor to ceiling windows instead of only one. This set us up with a virtually panoramic view of the Las Vegas strip at about 200 degrees around, too cool! We had room 955 if you want to see for yourself... The room was very comfortable: not a great TV set (but who cares?), the bed was among the best, the bathroom was nothing special and the towels were huge! No complaints at all about the room. The hotel itself was very high spirited. They do a good job of giving the impression that there\u2019s a lot going on around you. There were plenty of bars, one or two nice shops, all the usual Las Vegas jive. I was really excited about seeing the famous Carnival in the Sky show. I had heard it was lots of fun and very inclusive, kind of a big party. It didn\u2019t turn out to be quite like what I thought. It started out as a sexy girly type dance with singing, then it became more of a hip-hop, high energy dance show. Still lots of fun, even if it\u2019s not your thing, the big floats in the sky are still worth seeing at least once. There\u2019s a lot of gyrating and skin involved with this show, not an illegal amount, but you might want to think twice about bringing your children to see it if you\u2019re a little conservative. If you want culture, go see the Venetian Trio instead. The Rio also offers complimentary shuttle service to Harrah\u2019s and to Paris, making the central strip area very accessible. Of course the buffet is the best all around. The best price and variety, hands down! Bare in mind that I\u2019m talking about the Carnival World Buffet, not the Seafood Buffet. I haven\u2019t tried the Seafood Buffet, but the World Buffet is unbeatable. As mentioned in the name, it features cuisine from around the world. Everything from steaks and chops to Chinese, Italian, Vegetarian, Hispanic foods and of course food gear specifically to children. You\u2019ll be spending about 27 dollars a head, extra if you want more than just a fountain drink. If you have a healthy appetite, or invite me along, you\u2019ll get you money\u2019s worth. The Rio hasn\u2019t taken the number one spot on my list of favorite Las Vegas hotels, but it delivers in all major areas. Save a little money and don\u2019t skip out on quality, that\u2019s why I\u2019ll revisit the Rio, great food and a lively atmosphere all under one roof.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Okanagan/BC", "Title": "\u201cFirst Vegas trip\u201d", "Author": "north-ok-bc", "ReviewID": "UR61934408", "Content": "The Rio was very nice.

They also charged .50 cents a minute, which I thought was a little high. Also, the pool was only open from 9a-5p. After a night on the town, or gambling, the last thing I wanted to do was to get up early to go to the pool before it closes. I thought that 5pm was a little early, seeing as every other hotel I've ever stayed at was open until at least 8pm, some 10pm. There was also an issue with the trip booking. The trip was payed for in the beginning of January. I used a debit card - paid in full. I don't have credit cards, so when we got there, they wanted $100.00 PER NIGHT extra for a security deposit. No where in the booking, contract or front desk did they have this in fine print or anything that forewarned us of this before the trip. The money is returned at the end of the trip (5-7 business days), but still, it was unavailable funds that was counted on being available to us.

The room was great and comfortable, the staff was so friendly - we had a wonderful time, especially with the Keno ladies. So I am not complaining about any of that - just a great stay..EXCEPT, the food. Really? The first night we got in late, and did the buffet. HORRIBLE. we blamed it on the late arrival - tried the sports grill over the next few days hoping for better...and the american grill and Sao Pallo...All horrible. All the food was under cooked or over cooked - we gave all of them 2 or more chances, hoping our first experience was just a bad food choice. NO. We didnt want to leave the casino because we were playing Keno for hrs - 9 to 12 a day - and were stuck eating horrible food or leaving our game. I got physically sick 3 times out of the 9 times we ate there. We ended up leaving to go to the mirage buffet - same price. The RIO food was consistantly low quality. The last night we decided to give the buffet on last shot - not one thing I took wasnt over cooked or horrible tasting - and im not kidding - I spit out the pasta salad, couldnt cut the ribs, the shrimp in garlic sauce was so overcooked it was mealy and GROSS, rolls stale, just everything..and then realized all of the forks at our table had food stuck between the tines- all dirty. $60 dollars, and we left hungry. The only thing I ate was salad- and I got horrible diarrhea from it within an hr. I am so disapointed - we wont be returning to the RIO- to gamble again - although its sad because we so enjoyed the staff and the games and the room. I actually went to bed hungry after 5 nights every night because I couldnt stand the food - especially because it why pay $10+ bucks for a burger that has a stale bun and the meat is over cooked? I just felt I had to let you know just how UNPLEASANT the dinning experience was during our stay. Very sad.

I figured that a night in the Rio All Suite should be satisfactory, given its four star rating, but did not expect it to be such a step down. The room was not unlike the one that I saw in an on line picture provided by the hotel, which gives a 360 degree view. The difference is that without the fish eye lens, it no longer appears so grand. But the main difference between the on line picture and the actual room is that the one on line is pristine and the one I stayed in was far beyond its prime. Although the room served my purpose for the night, I would not want to stay there for any extended length of time. I call it a room, not a suite, because it's a room, not a suite. I checked the dictionary to be sure, and it told me that a suite is a \"connected set of rooms.\" By that definition, it was a suite, but so is any room in Motel 6 with a separate bathroom. I stayed in a large bedroom with two queen beds, a separate sofa area, and an old fashioned low definition television. To be fair, the bathroom was somewhat nice, if not very memorable. It did have granite counter tops sinks with good lighting (12 bulbs surrounding the mirrors) and came across as above average. But overall, the list of amenities was pretty small for the \"suite.\" It came with a phone, and you could get Internet access if you pay for it. Aside from the coffee table in front of the sofa, there was another small table with two plain chairs. It did have large windows with a good view, and drapes to block it off completely, but nothing to block outside noise completely. I would not go so far as to call it noisy. The room was carpeted, but the dirty carpeting is perhaps what gave the room such a lack of character. It had a small refrigerator, in addition to one that was presumably filled with snacks and beverages priced for your convenience. There was no coffee maker. On arrival, the service was courteous and professional. I was given a sincere apology for the long wait to check in. Perhaps they have more of a problem on some days or when there are conventions. I can't say what might be typical, but in my case, the wait was not comfortable. The reception area is right off the casino, making the smoky and moderately noisy wait stand out in sharp contrast to that in typical hotel lobbies. In contrast, the service I got when leaving was indifferent at best. I needed a cab to the airport, and there was no line. The only other guests there were still assembling and told the attendant that they were not ready. Since I had a family of five, others in his position would routinely wave a minivan sized taxi forward. In this case, I had to explicitly point out that there were five of us, to which he responded that the cab would fit five, as if to say \"what are you complaining about?\" If you go to Las Vegas to gamble, the overall room might not be such an issue. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the casino, the reception area might not be an issue. There are good shows to see there (Penn and Teller were there that night, and presumably many other nights) and the casino itself seems to have a lot to offer to gamblers. There are many other things on the premises that I did not get a chance to experience, but from what I saw, I would expect that if you go there for the casino, you will get a lot more. It's not the type of place I would recommend for a family trip, but if you are going for the gambling and the night life, it might still be a bargain. At the time of this writing, the economy is such that there are lots of hotel rooms at bargain prices. If I had been told nothing about the room except that it was a room in the price range that I paid, I probably would have considered it relatively good. If you can get a reservation at a low three star price, you will get a good room for the money.

Although we did have a great view of the dumpsters, we were able to look past that and get a partial view of some of the strip and the mountains in the background. There are 10 elevators serving the tower, we rarely had to wait which was nice. The rooms were very large and the furnishings were all adequate. I had read some reviews about the Rio not being very clean, but I thought the place was pretty clean. The staff was amazing and friendly.

The Sports Deli had a variety of choices for a fair price, we never had to wait long to eat. The Gold Coast across the street has a great breakfast buffet for 6 or 7 bucks. We had a car, so we could buzz around the area and check out some of the local casinos. We really liked The Orleans, which is only about 3 or 4 miles from the Rio. They had $5 tables, even on the weekends, and was a really a happening place.

The television is not the updated flat screens like the better towers, instead being an old school behemoth tucked into a wooden cabinet. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower unit.

Was looking for a \"quieter\" Vegas experience this time round and certainly found it at the Rio.No night time noise at all,being off strip. However....found the off strip location to be a hassle...lets face it you are going to want to hit the strip sooner or later-shuttle hours are 10.00am to 1.00 am-so if you're an early riser,you have to hang around until 10am to catch the shuttle....or pay for a cab.

A separate sink and make-up counter for the wife and a free room safe. Elevators were fast, never waited more than 1 minute. Quiet rooms no outside noise affected our sleep. Carnival buffet has an all day, all you can eat pass for $24. Great for addicted gamblers who just want something to eat to keep them from dying of malnutrition. Con's: I didn't care for their pillows. There 3 square pillows that just don't seem to work for me. They have support and they work, but it's really the only con of the rooms.

I had spoke with hotel staff several times over the phone and read from people on the TA Forums that it wasn't needed and I could decline.

I was with 2 other girls, so the extra mirror was great to have when we were getting ready. We immediately called downstairs for our bags and Housekeeping for extra towels. Everybody arrived promptly. We went to the Voodoo Lounge each night we were there and it was a great view. Music was a little bit old school for my taste. Didn't play anything that I was currently listening to. They played the songs that I had on my playlist like.. 2 to 3 years ago LOL.

I called security and they said they would give me a call once Housekeeping turned it in... never happened. It's my own fault for forgetting though.

I actually emailed the hotel with my concerns, also asking them if they could tell me if there were any construction or current \"issues\" that I should be aware of before traveling due to reading these reviews. Never got an email back. Oh well, stil kept the reservation. We reserved the Masquerade Suite for a great deal through Orbitz, but when we got there to check in (which was a breeze, no line at all) they upgraded us (by request) to the Cariocas Suite. NO XTRA CHARGE! A little smaller but much nicer. Check in staff were extremely polite, and welcoming, bell service was top notch....the most polite \"dept\" at the hotel. Got to the room, it was great. Very clean, no smoke smell, and just very pleasing all around. We had a spa in our bedroom which was wonderful (and clean), but I have to say that bed and those pillows were probably the worst I have ever slept on - period. I almost just wanted to sleep in the tub. I bring my own pillow case w/me, just a habit and that didn't even help. So two nights of uncomfortable semi-sleep...not fun. Ordered room service, very fast, and extremely polite. Now, this Carnival World Buffet that everyone talks about is and I mean this whole heartedly....HORRIBLE! Yes, there was a lot of different variety, but nothing tasted good. My husband can eat anything and believe me he tried so for him not to even take more than one bite of the prime rib or other items says a lot to me. We were really looking forward to it and walked away extremely disappointed. I would much rather prefer quality over quantity. Gambling was fun, won quite a bit actually; just on slots alone. The iBar was nice, but seemed expensive even for a \"vegas bar\". The server girls that are wrapped in tissue paper for an outfit weren't very attentive and my hubby and I ended up going up to the bar to order our drinks 3x because we got tired of waiting. It wasn't overly packed either. There is a shuttle that goes to other Harrah's hotels on the strip, this is very convenient and so the location of this hotel wasn't an issue at all. Another thing about this Hotel is that there is a number that you can text when you get there and they send you free offers via texts to your phone for 3 days while you're there. Like buffet discounts, drink discounts, and other nice offers. However, it's a little lame because you have to continuously take your phone to the Rewarde desk show it to them, delete it in front of them, get a voucher and THEN go where you want to go. It would be easier ot just show the text to the buffet person or bartender...kinda ruins the buzz. Oh well. Now, the Seafood Buffet was pretty good, best service I've ever had! Our waiter was Angel and he was attentive, friendly, and geuinely seemed to want to make people happy. The food was worth the money, and I recommend it. Overall, it was an ok experience. I didn't leave with the \"I can't wait to come back\" feeling, which I had when I stayed at the Monte Carlo and other hotels, but it was a decent trip and something I can say \"yes I've stayed there\". Unless I get comped, I probably won't stay there again, just due to the horribly uncomfortable bed we had. Maybe our expectations were too high, as we have heard our friends rave about it, but that was years ago and I think this hotel could use an facelift. Oh!

I will say that the casino needs a little update, i.e. filthy carpets are the first thing you notice. The staff was exceptionally nice: check-in, pit boss, craps/roulette dealers, bellhops, and the maids. I stayed in the Ipanema Tower in room 652, which was at the end of the hall...again, filthy carpets. I opened the door to the room, and I was pleasantly surprised with the updated, renovated room. I appreciated the space, especially when staying a week. Every morning it was very noisy, as the room is near the shipment receiving area and the dumpsters...request a higher floor. The food choices were mediocre, the Starbucks is fast, and VooDoo was fun (but overpriced). There is a free shuttle near the seafood buffet that takes you to either Paris or Harrah's on the strip, which helps with the biggest drawback to this casino...LOCATION. I generally took a taxi to my conference at the Palazzo, which costs around $8.75-10 depending on route and traffic...and it only took about 5-8 minutes. Likes: The staff, the views from the top of VooDoo, the 'price' of the room Dislikes: Location, Dingy carpets, noisy room around 8-10am Overall: The location is an issue if you want to walk from one casino to the next, but taxi rides aren't that expensive...although it can add up, if you're out there for a week.

The free Sky party show in the evenings is cheesy at best--very low rent but with enough skin to attract a a crowd but not too much. The Voo Doo lounge has one of the best views of the strip around--great perspective. Go early--before the dancers start, enjoy the view and lack of crowds--or stay and enjoy the dancing. Biggest complaint--be prepared to stand in line when checking in. There was not a time after 4:00pm when there was not at least a 20 minute wait to check-in. This is way too long!

The buffet at the Paris is much better. I didn't have any problems with the cleanliness of the hotel, and I'm usually very finicky when it comes to things being clean. Staff was friendly enough and gambling here was fun. One gripe was the elevators to our rooms ended up being REALLY slow the night of our event.

The Rio seems intent on getting just a little more money out of you when they can. The very friendly check-in receptionist tried many tricks of the trade to get us to agree to an upgrade: first asking us if a room on an upper floor with a view of the Strip would be o.k., and only later mentioning that it would cost more; engaging us in personal conversation and presenting a document for signature stating that we agreed to an upgrade (even though we had already said, \"no\"). We had an evening departure flight and they offered a late checkout 4 pm for $40. We declined and were offered a noon checkout time for no additional fees. We were very happy with the \"lower floor\" room. It was HUGE! While there was no view of the Strip, the view of the mountains and a few lights at night were sufficient. The room was very clean. It was surprisingly quiet at night even though the Rio focuses on entertainment for young adults who are looking for a \"good time\". (Think Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and Mardi Gras.) There was no in-room coffee maker. When I called to ask why, I was told that the \"lower floors\" do not have coffee makers - only the \"higher floors\". We arriived at noon on Thanksgiving Day and found only the buffet open. There were no other options except the very pricey champagne buffet dinner since all of the other restaurants in the hotel were closed. Even on days that other restaurants are open, there are few options for cheaper fare. The cafe is only open until noon or 1 pm, depending on the day of the week. Starbucks seems to be the least expensive dining option available. (They don't accept Starbucks gift cards!) The Rio is located quite a distance from the Strip. Unless you want a good hike, have a car or take the Rio's shuttles (which don't start until 10 am) to their sister hotels/casinos on the Strip, you're stuck. There is no easy way to go Downtown without hiring a taxi. If you are looking for \"adult-centered\" entertainment and bars, the Rio is for you.

I was very pleasantly surprised with the room. We were in the Ipanema tower on the 19th floor and the room was clean and much bigger than we expected, and the fridge is awesome (So many places in Vegas make you jump through hoops to get a fridge in your room or flat out refuse...the fact that it is apparently the standard at the Rio gets a thumbs up from me - gotta have my cold water!) The room we had either had been meticulously cared for over the years or was remodeled at some point because everything seemed new and clean, no spots on the carpet, nice flat screen tv and big closet. Bathroom had vanity area with sink and a mirrored sink by the toilet so my husband and I could get dressed without being in each others way. The Voodoo Lounge on the Roof was pretty much the most awesome thing ever - you take a glass elevator 50 stories up and the bar is half inside and half outside. Unlike other indoor/outdoor clubs the outside portion is really part of the club with the dj, an outside bar and go go dancers, not just a smoking patio like other clubs. Dancing in the open air 50 stories up with a 360 degree view is not to be missed! We ate at the Cafe and the Sports Deli which both had excellent food and service. Remember if you are staying at the Rio it isn't on the strip!! We were aware of this and took the tram with no problem and never had to wait - although on previous trips we have waited for the tram up to 20 mins. The tram runs from the Rio to several locations on the strip until 1 am. The show in the sky is fun and happens pretty frequently in the Masquerade Village area of the casino. One tip I have is if you are planning to stay at the Rio text \"rio\" to 227466 three days before you go - this gets you discounts like 5.99 buffet, half off penn and teller, etc. They have it advertised there but you get the texts over the course of a 72 hour period and they don't expire for a week so you might as well have them all ready before you go so you can plan accordingly - we received the text about penn and teller about 5 mins before the show started but we were already down at the strip and were kind of bummed because we would have gone if we knew ahead of time we could get half off! You just show your phone to the total rewards booth and they give you the promotion.

If you plan to stay over a weekend and honestly don't plan to party all night be planned to be awake anyway as the rooms aren't sound proof and you can hear the Show in the Sky into all hours of the night.

As such, the value was phenomenal! I was with 3 friends, and we had 2 suites located near each other on the same floor in the Ipanema Tower. The beds were comfortable and I like the safe and fridge in the room. It would be nice if they updated to a flat screen TV. We were on a low floor, so there was no view to speak of, although we could see the mountains in the distance. On 2 nights of the stay the power went out. We were told in advance that this would happen as work was being done. Letters were placed in a couple of places throughout the room describing the outage. The power would be out between 2AM and 5 AM. I guess this is something that had to be done, and it was done at a time that would minimally affect guests. However if I had paid for the room, I might have asked for some compensation for the inconvenience - particularly with the A/C off. To prepare for it going out, I set the thermostat to 60 and the room was cool enough during the scheduled power outage. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants. The pool area was nice with at least one heated pool of three. The table games in the casino had pretty high minimum bets.

I had booked this hotel based on price and value and the fact that it had shuttles to and from the strip. Please promise that if you go to this hotel, you will write a review when you return. I got so much good information from this site, and it all really helped to plan this trip. Now on to the review. I had asked for an early check in, a smoking room, a room as high up as they would give me with a nice view of both the moutains and the strip. We arrived at 10:30 am on the Monday and received fast, friendly and efficient service as well as everything requested. We got a room on the 13th floor, nice size, clean, very comfortable beds, a view overlooking the pool and you could see the mountains and the strip. In fact you could see the stratosphere tower while lying on the bed. Maid service was good and we left her a token of appreciation each day. The pools were beautiful, but we were so busy and the weather was not super hot, so we didn't indulge. The slot machines were ok, I followed advice found here about finding certain machines and had good play value from them. Loved Wizard of Oz, Deal or no Deal, Zeus, Slingo and a funny one about a penquin. On a sad note, we played for two days, on and off at this casino without ever once being asked for a drink? We were playing the penny slots, but come on we played 60-90 cents per hit. We took the shuttles over to the strip and back many times. The wait times were long and sometimes the crowds filled the shuttle and you had to wait for the next one or take a cab. They also do this awful two tiered system of letting the Platiunum and Super Seven member first and to the front of the line. I asked what it takes to become a member and was told it was thousands and thousands of $$$ in gambling points. My point is, if these people have this kind of dough to throw around, why do they need a free shuttle service. The should be taking cabs, limos, etc... So if you are renting a car, this hotel would be a good place to stay We ate at the Rub BBQ with a resturant.com coupon. The food was very good and the portion sizes were large. Our server was fantastic, didn't catch her name but she has tatoos all over her arms. We took the leftovers back to the fridge in our room and ate it for breakfast the next day. (didn't have a microwave or coffee maker in the room) We ate at the Voo Doo lounge one night. The food was good, the wine was great, the service was fine,the price was high. But, the view and ambience were so very nice. The pictures of this resturant do not do it justice. We also went to th Voo Doo bar. It has an indoor and outdoor venue. Drinks expensive but view is great. Do a visit up there, as the elevator ride alone is worth the adventure. On our last day we ate at the carnival buffet. It was huge! It had good food, lots of variety, drink specials at the bar, good service. Was not cheap, but was very very good. We finally got to see the show in the sky on Thursday. It was short but cute. I did get some beads. Glad the show was free. We asked for late check out but, they only gave us an extra hour. We got to check our bags and went off to play slots etc..until time to catch shuttle to the airport. We made two call from our room. One very short one to Toronto, and one to book that airport shuttle. I still don't know why that one was long distance & expensive. Telephone bill was $20.00. I would avoid using it. Book your return shuttle while you are at the airport. Overal, this hotel has excellent rooms, expensive but good food, nice pools and poor drink service and good play value slots. Would only go back if renting a car or the shuttle service increased frequency. They say on the weekends and in the busy summer season they run every 15 minutes. But, they would also have triple the occupancy rating and the shuttle is used by other people not just the hotel guests. So, plan a cab budget over to the strip.

Check-in lines were really long and quite a hassle when you realized there was a long line and only two people working. To be honest, there were a bunch of people also checking out and I've never figured out, unless there's a discrepancy, why they can't just use the video check-out in the room to save themselves and other customers the wait time!! We changed rooms mid-way through our stay, but both were in the Ipanema tower. This is the older tower, BUT it's been remodeled more recently. Both room had refrigerators, neither had coffee makers, and only one had an internet ethernet connection. Internet costs $9.95 per 24 hours which compared to other hotels I've stayed at is not bad. You have to let the front desk know at check-in that you need internet service or they will put you in a room without it. Beds in both rooms were extremely comfortable! The first room had a huge bathroom and two separate dressing areas, but the second room only had a small bathroom. The Chinese restaurant and sports bar (next to each other) had great food with huge portions so it was easy to split up an entree and feed two people. The All American Grille place was also good. As usual, the Carnival World Buffet was great - tons of food and something for everyone. We also walked across the street to the Gold Coast (?) to have a more affordable breakfast buffet one morning ($5.65). The pool was not crowded, they let you take two towels, beverage service was fast and one night there was a free concert out at the pool. The shuttles to the strip are very handy, but the lines did get long so if you're trying to make a showtime or dinner reservation, allow extra time. The only disappointment in the shuttles was that on our last day we weren't departing until 8pm so planned to spend the afternoon on the strip and just leave our bags with a bell desk over there. We only had backpacks as luggage so didn't think it would be a big deal to bring those aboard, but we were told that no luggage was allowed so we had to catch a cab. It was particularly disappointing since the shuttle was only about half full. Dealers were hit and miss in terms of friendliness and table limits were lower than they have been traditionally; the recession definitely had an impact here. Also, we never saw the Sky show ... I think it was closed due to the recession. Cashier cage window lines were long, but again I saw lots of people with slot tickets and wondered why they didn't just use the redemption machines to get their money?? You don't have to wait in line y'know!

The last couple of times to Vegas, it wasn't like this and at 45 bucks a room, I was excited to go. No complaints about the room at all, and the view was great. and because we couldn't gamble at the hotel, we saved money! LOL So that is good to, but if you are staying at the Rio for the famous atmosphere, forget it . Right now, it is no different than staying at the Strat, except the Strat has a nicer casino and lower min tables. Also, the staff here at the Rio was Wonderful! every person we had the occasion to deal with.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyomissing, Pa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Great Staff, Great Room\u201d", "Author": "meatmanWyomissing_Pa", "ReviewID": "UR43748786", "Content": "Why would anyone want to stay on the Strip when there is a great casino 3/4 mile away from all the nonsense.

Stayed in the Mascarade tower which is in need of a total makeover. The bed was so uncomfortable I had back pain after the first night. The buffet was not as good as it had been previously, we went to the Orleans which is great for breakfast and/or lunch. We rented a car which made searching for food much easier. The best meal we had the entire five days was a lunch buffet at Arizona Charlies. Our trip downtown was rewarded with loose slots and our trip to the Silverton Casino was also rewarded with very loose slots. Overall, our trip was great, just very disappointed in the Rio.

I was in the water up to my waist and had to get out after about ten minutes. I could not stand the cold water any longer. One of he best features of the Rio was the free shuttle to Harrahs and Paris. There are two shuttle buses that start at 10AM and go until 1AM. The buses run every half hour. In the evenings the buses run a little late due to traffic on the strip. The casino was not overly impressive. The slot machines are tight as a drum.

After reading many of the reviews on here we were very hestitant to book a room here. However, we were on a budget and the air/hotel combo promotion we wanted to use didn't have many hotel options available. Fortunately I didn't regret the decision at all. I lowered my expectations after reading these reviews, but even if I hadn't, I would have been very satisifed. We arrived at about 11:00pm on a Friday night. There was a considerable line to check in, which took about 30-40 minutes. Once we were to the front of the line, the process went relatively quick. They guy at the front desk worked fast... don't expect anybody to kiss your rear, they are down to business at the check in, to help make your wait shorter. He knew we were in a group so he did everything he could to get our rooms close together. All of them were pretty close except for one, but they were all in the Ipanema tower. I didn't see the rooms in the other tower, but based on the pics posted on here they are WAY nicer. They are not true suites like many have already said, but they are much larger than standard rooms and have been updated with newer furniture. Beds were comfy, AC was cold, and the rooms were very clean. Absolutely no complaints about the amenities. My friends and I brough several bottles of alcohol in our luggage so we didn't have to go searching for a liquor store. I read the forums on here and had the impression it is difficult to find. It is not! The hotel had canned beer for a reasonable price ($15.99 for a 12 pack) and fifths of alcohol which was definitely more, but not extremely outrageous. Other items like water and pop were a bit out of line ($3+ each). I was also pleasantly surprised by the gambling here. I had the impression table minimums were going to be $30 during peak hours. There are higher end tables, but I was always able to find a $10 minimum table. I liked the video roullette in particular... only a $2.50 min per spin. Slots were a bit tight, but not as tight as the ones in the airport. They were a little looser across the street at the Gold Cost. The food is on the expensive side as well, so for more reasonable prices, walk 5 minutes to the Gold Coast. Their buffet was mediocre, but a lot cheaper. After our first night it was close to 4:00am when we came back to the hotel and the only place we found to eat was the American Bistro, which had a 30 minute wait... at 4am!?!? This is when we actually discovered the deals at the Gold Coast. There is a 24 hr Friday's their which has 1/2 off appetizers and $5 primo drinks at the off hours... definitely worth the walk. The location of the Rio was not the best, but certainly not a deal breaker. Even if you're right on the strip you'll do a ton of walking. Take the shuttle or cabs when you can. We walked so much there were several moments I wished I was paralyzed just so I wouldn't be walking. We came out of Cesars Palace once and my buddy was soooo sure the Rio was \"RIGHT THERE... Less than a block a way man\". After a half hour of walking in the 80 degree midnight heat, I hated him for talking me into it. The only slight disappointment I had about the Rio was that they closed the Saphire pool. I heard it was overpriced, but we were willing to check it out one day. The pool scene that remained was pretty weak. We strolled down by 11:00ish and almost all the chairs were taken. There are definetly more family oriented areas, but even the othere end of the pool didn't have much of an exciting scene. It was kinda cramped and dirty. I accidently got some pool water in my mouth and was weirded out by how salty it was... did they truck it in from L.A.? Overall, my expereince was very good and I cannot complain about the Rio.

Check in was a little slow, but I did arrive late on a Friday night. My room was clean and comfortable, modern and fresh. The great thing about the Rio are the sizes of the room. While they call them 'suites', it's more-or-less an oversized room, maybe you could call it a studio suite...But it has one TV (not a flatscreen), and one bathroom. (I always end up with a 'suite' at the Hilton, and there's always 2 bathrooms, 2 TVs and at least 2 separate rooms--that, to me, is a real 'suite'). Some report of old, tired rooms, but I asked at check-in for a 'renovated' room and was given one--looked like it had been re-done in the last year or so. Service at the hotel is great, the dealers and gaming floor people are very friendly and the maids always say 'hi' when passing them in the hallway. The restaurants in the hotel kept odd hours (I wanted Chinese for lunch one day, but didn't open until 4 and there's a breakfast-only place that closes at 11). The staple 24-hour place is the All-American Bar & Grill, which had a limited menu and marginal food and often came with a wait for a table...A small place for a hotel of the Rio's size. Their poker room is okay, not great, but was never much of a wait to get into a game. Their tournaments are small--they have a nightly 7PM tourney--I never got into it because the most they had (on a weekend) was 10 players.

The decor is totally inconsistent with the theme of the hotel, and is very dated. The carpets are dirty and stained. We were moved from the 31st to the 34th floor because the first room was dirty (crumbs, dirty bathroom, and nasty carpet). The front desk was rather accomodating with the room change. The room temp stayed on 65, but it was constantly warm in the room. The maid service was very timely though! The refrigerator didn't work very well at all. The casino is probably one of the smokiest ones I've seen in Vegas with the exception of a couple of dumps on Freemont Street. To be as large as the Rio casino is, the air doesn't flow well, but it is rather cool which is great. The cocktail servers in the casino are more on it than some I've seen in other places too! The casino is clean, and the restrooms and other common areas are too. The pool is not bad. Lots of kids at the beach which was a bummer. That is one thing that makes the Rio unique, and you just couldn't enjoy it with so many kids running around. There are 4 pools to choose from, but one was closed every day for cleaning preparing for the weekend. The pool just closes a bit too early for Vegas, 6 pm. The food at the Rio was actually pretty good! I only at breakfast and lunch there, but both were great. The food in the Sports Book deli is tasty. The World Carnival Buffet is great for your money! The Sao Paulo Cafe has good breakfast and good prices too with super service. The shuttle that takes you to the strip, either to Paris or Harrahs, was the best. Very timely and efficient! This really cut down on cab fare and is a great feature,...use it! The Show in the Sky is entertaining for a few minutes. I wouldn't let any kids watch it though...it's pretty provactive for being FREE! The singers and dancers are talented, and fun to watch.

It was dated (looked like a suite from 1980's) worn, and dirty. We immediately called to complain and were switched to another room but noticed the room was drastically different. It was remodeled and updated. Although it still did not look anything like what was advertised it was much better.

Almost everything about my recent stay was awesome. So here comes a true review and honest account of my stay at Rio Suites from July 22nd thru July 27th, 2009 ( it was a long stay and I did a lot of things, so excuse anything that may be omitted ): The Arrival: I arrived at Rio Suites about 1:30PM. First great thing to note, the Check-In desk is near the door so there is no need to make a lengthy trek with a bunch of luggage as may be customary with other hotels. While in line I was entertained with a television screen of the \u201cgoings-on\u201d at the Rio, as well as other Harrah-owned Casinos located in Las Vegas. If you have a cell phone ( who doesn\u2019t nowadays ) get ready to send a text message and Rio will reward you with various offers throughout your stay. According to Rio\u2019s Policy, the Check-In time is 4:00PM, yet I have never ( okay once, at one of their different hotels ) had to wait for a room. I was in my room by about 2:15ish. It was a beautiful room with a magnificent view of The Strip \u2013 unfortunately there was no internet access in that tower. In Rio\u2019s defense, upon Check-In I did not specify I need a room with internet access, but again, I was not asked that question either. The front desk ( I believe his name was Charles or Charlie ) promptly sent a staff member to the room with a key to a new room with internet access ( and on a higher floor, too ). Now let me stop for a minute because it is necessary to highlight a feature that can be overlooked \u2013 the elevators. I don\u2019t think I ever waited more than a few minutes for an elevator going up to my room or going down to the casino \u2013 this includes the busy time of the weekends, as well as during Check-In and Check-Out times when foot traffic is at its highest. I won\u2019t go into detail with the room. Suffice it to say that I was very happy with everything about it: Lots of pillows on the beds; a nice television with quite a few channels; good water pressure and lots of hot water for a lengthy shower; plenty of closet space; an in-room safe and refrigerator; a separate area from the bathroom with an additional sink and a huge counter to get ready ( I think it is called a vanity area? ); couch, coffee table, desk and plenty of lamps to light up the room or give an ambient glow \u2013 depending on the mood. There may be more, but these are the amenities that stood out most to me. Some reviews stated that the food was expensive and the machines in the casino didn\u2019t pay-off. I found my meals ( mainly at All-American Bar & Grille ) to be reasonable priced and the food very good. Although there was a Starbucks right by the elevators that I take to my room, I found the coffee at AAB&G to be just as good as what I would get at Starbucks. Let me side track again to highlight another feature which is that the gift shop is right by the elevators as well, making it very convenient to run down and grab whatever you may need ( be it some alcohol, a bag of chips, water or toothpaste ). I did not have the need to shop for anything, but found the location very appealing \u2026 just in case. As for the machines not paying-off \u2013 I hit quite a few nice hands in video poker which allowed me to keep entertained while enjoying some sports on television and Rock-n-Roll music over the speakers \u2013 and, of course, the drinks keep getting poured. I guess this is as good time as any to mention the various members that make up the staff: My main reason for eating at All-American Bar & Grille is because of the bartenders/waiters. Every one of them that I encountered was VERY courteous, friendly and helpful. I won\u2019t go into great detail about the helpful part, but just know that they will make sure you are taken care of, no matter what \u201cshape\u201d you show up there \u2013 they know The Rio is one big party! For the most part, everyone at the Rio took care of business \u2013 be it the front desk, the room cleaning service, the Total Rewards customer service, the waiters/waitresses, bartenders, etc \u2026 Overall, I was more than satisfied with their service and attention. Sure, there may have been one person that was going through \u201csomething\u201d and didn\u2019t offer their absolute best, but that was quickly overshadowed by other staffers. When I did play a table game, the dealers were in a good mood, which always makes it more pleasurable to play, whether you are winning or losing. Cool story, I was wandering around the casino floor \u2013 lots to see \u2013 and wasn\u2019t paying too much attention to the people around me, when I accidentally bumped into a rather large man with long dark hair. As I turned to excuse myself, lo and behold, it was Penn Gillette and, beside him, kind of snickering, was Teller. As they walked to their Showroom, people were waving and hollering to them. They acknowledged some people with a glance and smile. Like I said, just about everyone at the Rio that I encountered was courteous and friendly. Here\u2019s a little bit of the downside and not in a bad way: There is A LOT to do and see at the Rio. There is really no reason to leave the premises. I didn\u2019t use the pool or even go to the pool area, but I did have a slight view of it from the room. It didn\u2019t look overly crowded which is nice, but it wasn\u2019t quiet either. The Show in the Sky is not to be missed \u2013 there are a lot of reviews about it, so I won\u2019t say anything else except, yes, I got my beads. McFadden\u2019s is a good place to eat \u2013 a little pricey and if you want a raucous time \u2013 go there at night \u2026 it is WILD!!! As I am not much of a Clubber, I went to VooDoo Lounge in the early evening. The view from the patio is a \u201cMUST-SEE\u201d ( I was told that by many people and now I am saying it ). I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time inside, but it looked really interesting the way it was decorated. Again, there are many reviews so I won\u2019t go into detail. They allowed me a later Check-Out time which is nothing new and always nice ( that\u2019s just Harrah\u2019s taking care of customers ). It didn\u2019t take all that long to get through the line ( I usually check out electronically, but wanted to have the \u201cfull\u201d experience ). I have always wanted to stay at Rio Suites since they opened and finally fulfilled this dream. Was it worth the wait \u2026 ABSOLUTELY! I have already booked a room when I return in September and personally, I CAN\u2019T WAIT!!! The only two things that I can think of that may not have been to my expectations are: (1) The view from the room, which was supposed to overlook The Strip, was very limited. In Rio\u2019s defense, I did not request a \u201cspecific\u201d view and, by all accounts, I could see \"some\" of The Strip from my room. (2) The wait time for the shuttle from the Rio to The Strip. In Rio\u2019s defense, I am a \u201cmover\u201d and don\u2019t like to wait around, so even 15 minutes seems too long for me. Other than that, when I did get the shuttle, the driver was very courteous and the shuttle was comfortable and air conditioned.

I always get comps, and this was no different. This hotel is a shambles. The rooms are worn and old, the casino almost seems like it belongs downtown. And when I asked for \"top shelf\" drink...aka Kettle One, I was told I had to be a Platinum Card Member (my play rating is about $150 per hand). Since I don't play a Harrahs card that often, I am not rated. The staff is non existant.

However, my traveling companion was able to persuade me as he had a lot of Harrah's Total Rewards points to pay for his room with and I got a really good weekend rate for an August stay ($70 Sat night & $40 Sunday night). After many hours of delays on my flight to Las Vegas, I got to the Rio about 7PM on a Saturday night. When I had made my reservation in February I had requested a smoking king handicapped room near the elevator in the Ipenema Tower. Well, 3 out of 5 ain't bad I suppose - the hotel was completely full due to a number of weekend conventions and all they were able to provide to me was a non-smoking king room near the elevator in the Ipenema Tower. Since many hotels are non-smoking now, I am used to staying in a non-smoking room and smoking outside the room and it wasn't a problem. I was just in my room to sleep, shower and change clothes! My room was on the 10th floor of the Ipenema Tower with no strip view - it overlooked Flamingo Road. But since I kept the curtains drawn at all times due to the strong sunshine and 106 degree temperature, no view was not an issue. The room was very comfortable - like some of the other reviewers, I do not feel that a large room with a couch, easy chair, coffee table and some floor lamps, as well as the bed area with a king sized bed and 2 nightstands is a suite. As far as I am concerned a real suite has at least 2 rooms with a door separating the bedroom from the living room! The bed was very comfortable, the pillows were plentiful, feather and wonderful, the room was clean & the fridge and safe in the closet worked . The toilet flushed fantastically well (it was like toilets on cruise ship - woosh!!), the hot water in the shower and sink were plentiful and the shower had some of the best water pressure I have ever experienced in a hotel. No complaints with anything in my room except that the air conditioning could have worked a little better. I had the thermostat set on 63 and it was still about 70 in the room. I would have liked it a little colder but it was fine for me. 2 light bulbs were burned out in my room. Sunday morning (got in late Sat night and did not want to deal with it) after I got up and showered I called housekeeping around 7AM. The front desk operator answered as housekeeping wasn't open yet. I explained about the burnt out bulbs and the operator said someone would come that day to replace them. No more than 5 minutes after I hung up the telephone, there was a knock on my door. It was a maintenance man with pockets full of light bulbs!!! I could not believe my eyes!! I showed him which bulbs were out and he didn't have the right ones with him. He left and came back about 2 minutes later (the light bulb closet must have been down the hall for him to come and go so quickly!) and replaced the bulb in the bathroom straightaway. The lamp on the nightstand was actually unplugged for some reason. He just plugged in the lamp and low and behold, there was plenty of light!! I also told him that I would like a \"do not disturb\" sign for my door and he got me one of those, too. The maintainance department at the Rio should be commended for their prompt and speedy response to calls reporting problems in a room!!! We did not eat in any restaurants or drink in any of the bars. I do not like to play the slots at the Rio, but put $5 in a machine just to let Harrah's know I was there. Since I arrived on a Saturday night there were a lot of drunk 20-somethings at the bars out for a good time. The parking garage is quite a walk to the Ipenema Tower so I just valet parked. Even though the hotel was full valet parking was fairly quick. The valet parking garage got full both nights so unless you were a Harrah's Total Reward Diamond (or above) member you had to park in the self parking garage. I enjoyed my stay at the Rio but would not stay there again.. It is a way too large property for me - I prefer smaller hotels where I don't have to walk 5 miles to get to my room.

Every staff member we encountered - from the front desk to the casino cages to dealers to housekeepers - always said hello and responded immediately to any requests or questions we had. Our party of four had adjoining rooms with so it was like having one big suite. No complaints ... both rooms were clean and everything worked. No problems whatsoever. Of course, we didn't go to Vegas to watch TV or soak in tubs or iron clothes so we may have missed a few glitches. Previous posters were right about one thing - whoever is running the casino at the Rio has lost his or her mind. The only time we found a table with less than a $15 limit was at 2 a.m. Amazing since there were plenty of dealers at empty $25 tables. Needless to say, we didn't gamble much there. Another small beef - for a hotel that hosts the World Series of Poker, the Rio sure doesn't put much stock into its poker room. I'm sure there was a valet who had an untied shoe or a Total Rewards team member who had a smudged nameplate but we're not that finicky. Overall, we had a great time.

The whole place was kind of dated, and it's completely isolated from the other hotels and casinos on the Strip. If you want to go ANYwhere, you need to take a cab or a shuttle. I had to make several ridiculously overpriced purchases at the \"necessities\" store (including bottled water), because I couldn't get to a drugstore or any other retail outlet to get what I needed without paying for a cab ride to the Strip. The free show that is offered was closed during my stay, so I can't comment as to whether or not that's worth the visit. The slots are tight. It's nearly impossible to win a dime, and the minimums on table games are high, considering this is an \"off-strip\" hotel. Other reviewers here have talked about the \"free drinks\" they were offered. I was not offered one single free drink, and had to pay for absolutely everything - even a simple diet coke while I was shelling out hundreds at the tables. The pools are nothing like they appear in the pictures. The \"Sapphire\" (topless) pool has a hefty cover charge, and the free pools were crowded and dirty. There was a little island of trash in one of the pools that wasn't cleaned in the five days we were there. The suites are spacious, but that's about it. You have lots of room, but what do you need all that room for? It's just empty space. The room was clean, but the decor was very dated and the rooms offered nothing special. You also have to pay $10 a day for internet access. I've been to Vegas several times in the past five years, and this is the first time I've had to pay for internet access. We visited two restaurants there, and we were disgusted by both. The \"All American Bar and Grill\" was absolutely wretched. I ordered a \"buffalo chicken sandwich\" that was like no other buffalo chicken sandwich I'd ever experienced. The chicken was like a pan-fried chicken patty, but huge - three times the size of the bun (which was rock hard), and drowning in sauce. I took one bite and had to leave the rest. Not only was it giant and a weird consistency, but it was kind of burnt and just plain didn't taste good. My boyfriend's salad was full of brown and rotted lettuce. The other restaurant we visited was the \"Carnival buffet.\" This buffet claims to be voted the \"best\" in Vegas, but it was exactly the same as every other buffet in Vegas. Actually, probably worse than other buffets. It served the same food as every other casino, but the vegetables were old, the bread was stale, and everything else was just bland and pointless. I took several different items and had just one bite of each. Not one item was worth a second bite, and definitely not worth a second helping. If you have any sort of taste for gourmet or fresh foods, do not eat at the Rio. If your diet consists mainly of highly-processed, high-fat, low-flavor foods, and you go for quantity over quality, you might enjoy it. We did partake of the snack bar in the pool area, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food there. It was fresher than the food in the buffet, and cooked made to order, right in front of you, though it was pretty pricey for a \"snack bar.\" We also ordered from room service for a late night snack. We were looking for nachos, which weren't on the menu, but we asked for them anyway, and the kitchen staff made us a special order. This food was surprisingly fresh and tasty. If you aren't interested in doing a lot of sight-seeing and just want to hang out at a casino and pool, and aren't very particular, this hotel would be fine. If this is your first visit to Vegas and you want to see everything, or if you want to spend a lot of time on the Strip or downtown, I would not recommend this hotel. You will pay a fortune in cab fees getting back and forth to the Strip. There is a free shuttle, but it only comes every half hour. And it's very often too full and you end up having to wait for the next one anyway. If you're going in the summer, this is a critical point. The weather is in the 90's - 100's every day, and you do not want to be waiting outside for a shuttle for over an hour in that kind of heat. Other reviewers described a Rio in the past with a Mardi Gras atmosphere. No more. The Rio was BORING. We went to Vegas on a relatively busy weekend - there was a UFC fight, and the World Series of Poker (which was happening AT the Rio), however this hotel was dead.

How hard is it to make a hamburger patty? Difficult to get breakfast other than from the buffet, which we did once and it was so awful looking that I was tempted to get a manager to actually look at the quality of food that was being served. I will say that the girl working the omelet station was working very hard and putting out good food and that alone stopped me from saying anything at the time. So I got a $15 omelet- I could have gone over to Bouchon at the Venitan and paid the same thing for a world-class restaurant. 2) They apparently refuse to clean the rooms. I had drink from the casino and left on the table in my \"suite\". It sat on the table for my entire stay. Just to see if they would take it, I left it on the floor the final day and they did take it. So traveler's tip - if you want it picked up throw it on the floor. 3) Casino host staff horrid - they either don't know that their job is hospitality or they just don't care. My friend and I show up after speaking to host on phone prior to arriving with credit lines approved. We setup a quick meet with casino host- host comes 10 minutes late and then couldn't be less interested in even having a conversation. To be clear, we didn't even ask for anything- just to say hello and introduce ourselves. We didn't even get a \"how was your trip\" or \"be sure to try XYZ\" while you are here. 4) Cage employees and marker policy is a joke. Refused to give my markers back after paying for them via personal check- why did you do a credit check then? Was told them they would mail them to me in 5-10 days after my check cleared. I've never seen anything like this at other strip hotels. 5) General unfriendliness of craps pit staff. Although the pai gow staff was very nice. 6) Made us essentially pay for the entire stay with a deposit after checking in. A deposit so large that even with food and other charges they owed *Us* money on check-out. Two credit players essentially had to prepay for the room???? Can it be any more low rent? 7) It took two calls to resolve my bathtub draining correctly. First call resulting in someone coming to the room but it wasn't fixed- you take a shower and you're standing in 3\" of water. On the second day I called and had to ask 3 times for a facilities manager who did send someone who could fix the problem, after trying to tell me that these things happen because its a 20 year old building. How about I pay for the room in today's prices adjusted for 20 years of inflation then? No? I didn't think so. 8) High speed internet costs $12 - PER DAY!

TI, Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo, etc, but our favorite was the Rio. We are harrahs loyals and visit their properties in Lake Tahoe and Reno several times a year. This trip to the RIO was much different than any other. we were traveling with about 11 freinds/famly. I raved about the rio and had some discounts so I booked 4 rooms. In the past i have never had to leave them a deposit, and this time they wanted one on each room.. Not a typical hotel deposit for the first nights stay. A deposit of 300.00 per room for incidentals charged to the room. After informing them that I we would not be charging to the room, they reduced the deposit. Mine was 200.00 @ of the others were 100.00 and the 4th was 300.00. Why they go up and down like that I have no idea.To say the least I was very disappointed as i was not expecting to pay an additional 1200.00 for hotel rooms. Shoot, I would have booked the Wynn if I had. Checking in was a nightmare becasue of the 4 rooms. 2 of them were comp, so i guess you get what you pay for right? When we get to the front desk 1 of the 2 comp rooms is coming up with charges, they make me talk to the supervisor Scott, who was able to pull the tapes of my phone conversation when I booked the room, and verify that I was not trying to pull one over on them. Anyways he did comp the room and was very nice about the whole matter. Well we get up to our room in the masqurade tower, and there is a large (what looks like remnants of sex) stain on the couch, the room was not an updated room, and there was no comforter on the bed, just sheets. I called down and they said this is their new look. the 3 sheets.. Which were white, and the remainign decor was that bright old vegas color. looked awful. Anyway Scott changed our rooms for us. He was absolutely wonderful. Next we were put into the impanema tower. By then It didn't matter anymore I was just happy to be going out to dinner as everybody had arrived by then and was finished checking in. Our room, was better than the last one, but not nearly as good as the other 6 times we stayed at Rio. the carpet was shredded up.. I mean strands of carpet pulled up. Also, by the internet cafe by starbucks there was this one I'll just come out and say it.. HOOKER.. that was there every night. She would be signaling men to come over to her. We caught her being turned down 3 times. Then there was another time we were in the elevator with one who had to have been 21 and the john was at least 50.. disgusting. Rio used to be a classy place, and my favorite place to be. we love the atmosphere in the casino it is different then the other boring ones, but we have never liked to eat there. For some reason, the food there to me, is all way overpriced for mediocrity. One of our favorite things to do in vegas is have nice dinners. We don't mind paying the a la cart prices, but I can't stand paying too much money for something that leaves you disgusted afterwards. So usaully we never eat at the rio. On this trip however, because there were so many of us, you have to consider everyones budget, and 6 of us were looking to eat. Well the two old ladies in the group (my mom and my aunt) decided they wanted to stay at the hotel and eat, so after walking around undecided we settled on McFaddens. We went up to the host, and he said you have to wait for the hostess she is inside. So about 10 minutes later she comes out. This was on Saturday June 27th in case her boss is reading this. She informs us that there is a party and we can't come in. the house was not full by any means adn it was about 9:15. After my girlfriend was talking with her a while she comes back and says well \"we can seat you but you'll have to be done by 11:00.\" Mind you my friend who was talking with this young lady is african american. I could only have imagined how she must have felt. I don't believe the young lady was racist, but we sure did percieve it that way. Perception is reality. Anyway, we declined her not so inviting invitation to eat in their resturaunt, and decided on RUB.. I kept telling my mother, mom i don't want to eat at the rio we need to go somewhere else, but the boys wanted BBQ so the 6 of decided on RUB.. OH MY GOD.. our waiter seemed very attentive at first then distracted. He would ask me if i would like a refill, and when I confirmed he would walk away and right in front of us at the hostess stand, be palying with his iphone. He would then come back around ask how everything was, and then still not bring me my drink. And the food.. Come on.. Famous daves has better BBQ than this place for half the price. Anyway, we will not be staying here again, i am sure my husband will remain a harrahs loyal in the reno/tahoe area, as those hotels are really so much nicer than the ones in vegas.

By the way, Gardunos has a fantastic Sunday Margarita Brunch. This was our third time there and well continue to visit the Palms if only for the Margarita Brunch. It's that enjoyable! Anyway, back to the Rio. The best thing I can say about the Rio is they do have the fantastic World Buffet. But come hungry, there are so many great choices. Over all our experience with The Rio left us disappointed. Services everywhere were not what I've come to expect in Vegas. For instance, the day we decided to visit the pool was the day they apparently chose not to open the main pool. There were quite a few people in the pool area but the main pool was completely roped off. Of course, the pool bar was beyond the main pool, so we had to jaunt over there to get our pool drinks. (There was a closed pool bar near the pool that was opened! Was beginning to think this place was run by politicians.) All in all, it seemed that most people who worked there that we came into contact with were bothered that we were even there. We constantly felt like we were in their way! Aren't they supposed to want us there? The room was not as nice or clean as I remembered from my last stay there. I don't think they vacuumed once during our 4 night stay. One evening I noticed a red mark on the coffee table. I figured it must be nail polish and perhaps difficult to remove. But, no, I rubbed on it and it came right off. One evening upon returning to our room I noticed that ome of my pillows was missing from my bed. The bed was made, but the extra pillow was still on the floor on the far side of the bed where it must have fallen while I slept. That's what tipped me off to the possibility that they weren't vacuuming. So I looked a little more closely at the floor and noticed some bits of things that would've easily cleaned up with a quick run of the vacuum. Then I started paying more attention to little things. ie. fingerprints on the windows, etc. ... I've always expected to not feel previous peoples presence, and this was certainly not the case. I knew ahead of time that they do not have coffeemakers in the rooms, but it would certainly be a nice addition. I also noticed the smell in the Masquerade Village area was just awful.

The lady I called for reservation even gave me tha total amount of the discounted rate, The only weird thing is, when they emailed me the confirmation was there's no amount of the reservation. Any way, after half an hour of grueling argument , he found out his mistake when he called someone for verification and apologized and gave us finally the room at the non-smoking fourth floor. The agony didn't stop there. The room (all suite room hotel) they gave us stinks with smoke, the sofa looks like it came from the dumpster, the carpet is stained all over, and the bathroom is small (no bath tub) for a suite room. We called the concierge and ask for a transfer but the guy said they are fully booked when in fact there was not to many people in the casino. What they did is, sent a service guy to our room and spray some deodorizer. Well, I told my wife to just be patient and we will just sleep in the room for a couple of a hours a night and never come back. Even the World buffet is not that good anymore than a couple of months ago. Good luck to you if you still want to book in this hotel.

The suite was fully equipped with two large flat screen televisions and a small flat screen in the bath The flat screen in the bedroom was not working properly and had been unplugged by Rio staff- no matter, we were on the comfortable pillow top mattress by 10 on Saturday night anyway. The bath had a large jacuzzi and separate shower and dual sinks in a stone vanity counter. The suite had a refrigerator and coffee maker, two things along with the jacuzzi that our suite at Encore on Sunday night did not have. Point to Harrah's this trip. This was a nice comp!

I had a temporary DL without a photo and was not able to obtain another Total Rewards card so none of my play was credited this trip.

I waited in line at the buffet for 50 minutes while Gidget played video poker and managed a \"discount\" on the buffet ticket with a small win. The buffet is big with what seems like an unlimited selection, as usual. I only visited one or two stations and was happily stuffed. The salmon got a \"not up to par\" review from Gidget. We give it a B / B+ considering price vs quality. Some more play after dinner and we had more dollars than we came with, not quite a hundie but up is up and that feels good. There was no \"do not disturb\" sign to hang on the door when you're out (there is a lever to flip on the inside of the door when you're in that informs housekeeping you do not want to be disturbed) so housekeeping cleaned up sometime Saturday afternoon and we left a nice tip for the maid on Sunday.

The bed did not look very clean, there was rust in the bathtub, I had to keep the blinds always closed since my room faced the roof and there were people walking around. They charged $25/day to use the fitness center. The location of the hotel doesn't help either - quite a walk from the strip, and over a highway. Positives: the room service was decent and very fast; maids seemed to be thorough, the bar downstairs made really good bloody marys. Bottom line, stay here if you can get a really good deal. But for $200/night they charge on their website, you can find a better place.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs, What a nightmare, next time stay at Red Rock all class\u201d", "Author": "CDNTraveller-2009", "ReviewID": "UR27875298", "Content": "They should blow this hotel up next, it was terrible got $50/night hotels.com.

The answer is no. My husband and I planned our trip to Vegas so I could attend a conference that was being held at the Rio. We had always stayed on the strip so we were reluctant to stay off the strip. I read TripAdvisor reviews and decided to give it a try. Despite the negative reviews I read about airport transfers we decided to use the Bell shuttle van outside baggage claim. I had stopped to ask what a typical cab fare was to the Rio on the way to baggage claim. Another passenger overheard me and advised not to take a cab since every time she used one she was ripped off by the drivers. So we bought a one way ticket to the Rio. We were the last stop. From the time we landed \u2018til we got to the hotel was exactly 2 hours. When we went to the check in area there was only one person ahead of us waiting to check in. We stood next to the sign that said \u201cCheck In\u201d and the person behind the desk told us to move around to the other side of the stantion as we weren\u2019t \u201cin line\u201d (now we were the only people in line!). I had booked and prepaid for the room in January requesting a non-smoking king in the Ipanema tower. The clerk said he only had two queens or a handicapped king room left. We didn\u2019t think either was acceptable. I said firmly \u201cyou mean you don\u2019t have another non smoking king room anywhere in this hotel?\u201d He magically found us one. Our room was at the very end of the hall (we passed several old room service trays in the hall on the way) and overlooked the strip. It was actually quite lovely. A large open room with sofa, chair and king bed. The floor to ceiling windows were neat and offered a great view of the strip. The room was very clean and well appointed. We were a little disappointed in the weak shower stream but I guess that goes with the territory of being in the desert. There was a large chip in the porcelain finish of the tub. Luckily we only had people on one side of us but it was still noisy at times. Someone took a shower above us every AM at 6. And there was a drunk guy across the hall who stumbled in each morning at 7 AM and banged on the door loudly shouting his wife\u2019s name to let him in. The last night we were there a family with a baby moved in next door and he shrieked for hours on end. I began to think that maybe they just left him alone in the room. I guess all of this is par for the course in staying at a 24 hour resort. We noticed there was an in room safe but no instructions on use. We decided to stop by the desk and ask about use after we unpacked and grabbed a bite. We asked the clerk behind the desk how the safe worked and he indignantly stated \u201cthere are instructions right on it\u201d. When we insisted that there were none he called a security guard to come up and take a look. He instructed us on the operation of the unit and it appeared to work. Thank goodness we tried one more time before putting anything in it as it did not open. We could never get it to work again. The next morning the room service trays were still there. In fact the same trays were in the hall for almost 72 hours. I am thinking that would have to be a health risk or invite vermin or something? It was just gross. I made the LONG walk to the convention area. All kidding aside it must have been at least \u00be of a mile. The meeting rooms were very nice. The food in this area was not fresh. I tried a couple of different baked goods and they were extremely stale. After the meetings we wanted to check out the pool. The pool was open but was staffed by what we referred to as the pool nazi\u2019s. Teenage kids who really took their authority and ran with it. This was not a crazy pool crowd. It was a bunch of middle aged overweight people, some with kids etc\u2026no hot chicks or dudes no craziness. Really nothing to police but we felt like we were in a police state not a relaxing oasis. I brought a bottle of water with me to the pool. When I approached the first pool kid she went through all my bags and advised that no outside drinks were allowed. I said \u201cit is just water\u201d and she advised that I would have to pour it out. Ok this is the desert and you really feel it as I felt dehydrated the whole time I was there. I could feel some rage coming on so I said again\u2026hey it is just water why can\u2019t I have water? She insisted \u201cpour it out or you can\u2019t come in\u201d. So I took the water and dumped it out right in front of her. I went to grab a towel and asked to see a supervisor. It was another boy who I kid you not, was playing a video game on the computer behind the desk! I asked where was the policy written that no water is allowed at the pool? He said it wasn\u2019t written anywhere but was a policy that NO outside drinks were allowed and said there is a drinking fountain over there. The real business here was SELLING drinks. A few people did that but the actual drink was not allowed within exactly 12 inches of the pool edge. A lifeguard nazi actually went up to a guy sitting at the edge of the pool and made him move the drink one inch so could be in compliance. Needless to say I did not stay long on any of my pool visits as I was so dang thirsty I had to leave. I wasn\u2019t about to use a dirty fountain or buy a $5.00 bottle of water. Between the searches and the no liquids rule I felt like I was being frisked and harassed by the TSA at the airport. No, the pool was neither relaxing or enjoyable\u2026plus the chairs were filthy and in need of a good scrub. As a curiosity we checked out pool protocol at other hotels on the strip and we saw none of the no drink, search your bag foolishness. This must be a Rio exclusive. Actually we spent little time at the Rio other than my meetings. We either walked to or took the free shuttle to the strip. There were so many shopping and dining choices there and no pool Nazis. I can\u2019t think of one advantage this hotel had over a strip hotel other than actual size of the room. They were not real suites but were large and clean\u2026other than that I simply cannot recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redlands, California", "Title": "\u201cOkay Stay\u201d", "Author": "ntz4bbl", "ReviewID": "UR27806080", "Content": "We just came back from a 3 night stay at the Rio for a conference.

The Rio is feeling old. We stayed in the Mandalay Tower and the room we stayed in was not one of the remodeled ones and there were stains on the benches at the ends of each bed and the carpet was old and worn out. There were barely any amenities - a container of lotion that was used and a container of shampoo/conditioner combo. Refrigerator, but no coffee maker. There is a coffee stand near the elevator for the Mandalay Towers but it was never opened when I went by so I had to walk to the Ipenema Tower to Starbucks (a good distance away) or the Starbucks near the convention section which had limited hours. Overall the room was clean and even though the room was on a floor shared with smoking rooms, the room was smoke-free and that was great. I also loved the water pressure in the shower. I visited a friend staying in a suite in the same tower and their room was remodeled and very light and airy. Big difference from my room. The Casino itself was dated - not as many new slot machines as in other Casinos as an example. The Seafood Buffet is excellent and I would highly recommend eating there one night. Great price and great food! Wide selection even for those who do not like seafood. I wanted to work out in the gym/spa but the hours were not very convenient. Since this hotel has a very large convention center, I'd expect it to accomodate business travelers but the gym didn't open until 6 a.m. and closed at 8 p.m. Other spas at Vegas hotels open at 5 a.m. and close at 10 p.m. The concierge really isn't a concierge, but someone who books shows and other Vegas entertainment for guests. The front desk line was usually long, so if you needed assistance, it was hard to get someone to help you. Voodoo Lounge on the 51st Floor has a mixed crowd on weekends. It features a great view of Vegas from its oversized balcony. On Tuesday night we wanted to go up just to see the view and since it was after 10 p.m. there was a $20 cover. We were told we can come any night before 10 for no cover. The bouncer did not tell us or ask us if we were hotel guests, because unknown to us - upon check-in we received coupons for various Vegas venues and it included a pass to Voodoo, We also went for drinks in one of the restaurants - some Italian place that advertises half bar, half club, all Italian. Don't waste your time or money. Everything we tried to order as a cocktail from their specialty drink menu was not available because they did not have some or all of the items. Then she only served me my drink and forgot my friends drinks. Then after sitting there for a good hour chatting, she never came back to see if we wanted another cocktail or even an appetizer. We finally asked for our check and she didn't remember what we had ordered. We gave them a new motto: Half Bar/Half Club/Half Tip! Don't waste your time or energy on this place.

It's a great hotel for singles. There are a lot of single girls and guys there, and even if you aren't looking to hook up you will have a great time just watching the waitresses. Not to mention their free Masquerade in the Sky show, which is unbelievably hot! These girls are wearing lingerie and dancing on floats on the ceiling..... it was fantastic especially for a single guy like me. There are also chippendales and male dancers for the ladies. The rooms are big, and I like the layout. It was clean and everything worked nicely. The pay per views are way too pricey, but I digress. I ate some of their restaurants, and they were all good. I especially enjoyed the Village Seafood buffet, which was 40 dollars but included all you can eat lobster. I ate what I paid for in lobster alone.

I couldn't find anything for under 250 a night.. So I gave it a shot...It was the best experience I have had in Vegas in a long time..I hadn't stayed at the Rio for a couple of years and thought, from the reviews, that it had gone down the tubes. I followed this guys advise on this site to give the check in counter person a $20 with your credit card and ID. and it worked..I asked how a strip view up high would work..She said I'll see what I can do, and walla I had a great room. It's all how you treat your workers. the machines were a little tight, but on the 4th day of my stay, I got back about $700 from the penny slots between me and my wife... I know most people don't write reviews when they have a good time at places, only when they have a bad time. Well this is one I had to write about. everything about our stay was awesome. don't judge a place just by the reviews on these sites. these are usually just a fraction of the people that stay at these casinos.. now the smoke was bad. But the smoke was bad at every casino we went to. It didn't matter where you went..the smoke was worst at the older cainos. Just shower before you go to bed and your sheets won't smell like smoke your entire stay. I hope this helps you guys looking forward to stayin at the Rio. Oh one last thing, I looked at every caino's buffet that I went to, and noone compares to the Rio. (not even Ceasars) the Rio really is the best buffet in Vegas.. I know a lot of writing, but, I had to write about the unfairness that is being brought on the Rio... It really is a nice place to stay at.

At first, I didnt think I could afford to stay at a resort. But I got a room for the popular weekend for about $300 (great price compared to what the other hotels were charging for that particular weekend.) The room was huge. I don't know how they are getting away with calling them 'suites', because they are really just big hotel rooms with a couch. But that doesn't matter, we had all the room we needed. We requested a low floor, so we didnt have to wait on the elevators long. They gave us the 4th floor in the masquerade tower. We had a great view of the mountains, the other building and THE ROOF lol. But it was ok! Thats what we requested. It was a fair trade off, considering we never had to wait more than 15 seconds for an elevator. And, you could also technically see part of the strip (Trump tower, Treasure Island, some other stuff). With that said, I would definitely recommend for people to get mountain view room and go as close to the bottom floor as possible. The entertainment at the cassino is UNREAL! It was amazing! Singing, dancing...the cocktail waitresses were EVERYWHERE! They were coming in waves, offering drinks when I already had an order in! I even got a drink while at the penny slots! I have NEVER been offered a drink at a penny slot! We saw the Penn and Teller show, and we loved it. We were already huge fans, but even then, the show is pretty awesome, and if you stay here, you have to see it. The Carnival Buffet was great for breakfast. Every breakfast food under the sun and then some. The burgers at All American Grill were to die for. And Rubs BBQ on the 2nd floor of Masquerade villiage was amazing. I did have some issues, but are just barely worth mentioning. We had a king bed, and it came with 3 really fluffy pillows. My husband and I are used to 2 pillows each. These pillows were weird...1 pillow wasnt enough, but 2 was too many. We decided to request a 4th pillow, so we could have 2 each. I request it pretty late our first night there, and they said they would put the request in, although no 4th pillow showed up. Not a big deal, like I said, it was pretty late at night when I requested it. The bed at first feels pretty outdated when u sit on it. I thought for sure it would be uncomfortable to sleep in, but both my husband and i woke up feeling well rested (and hung over) each morning. some of the light bulbs in the bathroom didnt work, but there was still PLENTY of light (well, when you turn the bathroom lights on, they look kinda dark, but after a few seconds, they get brighter...like they had to warm up?? but once that was done, the bathroom was nice and bright). the water pressure in the bathroom was SO STRONG! and yes, its true that there is no coffee makers in the room. but that was FINE for us, since we dont drink it. if the lack of coffee maker is keeping you from staying at this hotel, then either plan on getting it at breakfast or in the lobby, go to the 2 starbucks on the property, or for $3 at the grocery store you can buy those Folgers single packs of instant coffee. The water get really hot really fast in our room too, so that was good...instant hot water if we needed it! we arrived at 3pm and there was almost no line to check in. check out line was pretty long, so we went back to our room and checked out over the phone. some tips: if u take a taxi to the Rio from the airport, don't take the interstate! it cost us about $30 to get to the hotel using the interstates, but the morning we left, our driver took non-interstate roads, and it was only $20. there is a shuttle to the other harrahs properties, but it doesnt start until 10 AM (we sat out there from 8:45 to about 9:30 before we figured that one out LOL), we just took cabs. Its about $10 including tip to go from the Rio to either Paris, Caesers, Bellagio or Ballys.

If your going with your wife or seriouse girlfriend I hope she isn't shy and your secure because the regular pool is so crowded you wont even be able to sit down so you'll have to go to the topless pool with all the young perverts who come to the hotel just for that.

We just got back from a convention at the Rio and found it to be disappointing from the research and reviews we had read prior to leaving for the convention. First, when we checked into our room we found a used condom on the floor at the edge of the bed. Then, noticed that the experience coupons that they had given us at check-in were last months and expired. Day 2 we went to the pool only to find it closed at 6 PM, and one of the 3 pools were closed for cleaning. The hotel was at full capacity and had at least 1 pool closed every day of the week during our stay and one day had 2 pools closed, the good thing is it was only 105+ everyday so who would want to cool off, right? We decided to try breakfast on day 3 at the Sao Paulo Cafe and the service was terrible. They never brought the condiments we requested so, we had to ask another table if they were done with theirs. Then the coffee was delivered once we were done with breakfast and the service was extremely slow, you could tell they were short staffed. We tried a few more meals at the cafe and found this to hold true every time. Our room and little to no hot water between the hours of 6 AM and 10 PM on a daily basis. The non-smoking rooms reserved for 3 of our traveling mates had been given to other guests and they were assigned to smoking rooms with no discount or explanation given. They had booked 4 months prior to our visit. We decided to go bowling one night at the Lucky Strike Lanes and were told to leave at midnight because they felt like closing 2 hours earlier than their sign stated. After speaking with the manager they said it was because the alley was to slow but, they had 6 of 10 lanes running, people at the bar and people shooting pool? We were never advised by the rewards center or staff that if we presented our players card at any shop or restaurant associated with the Rio or Harrah\u2019s property's that we would earn additional credits. We found that out by accident on our last day when we noticed a small sign in one of the shops that explained that rewards members get a 10% discount on merchandise. We decided to purchase an in room movie one night \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and the picture quality was horrid. On a few occasions I was never tracked at a gaming table because the pit boss was to busy and didn't get around to me before I lost my shirt.... On our last morning room service came to our neighbor\u2019s door and began pounding on it for 5 minutes announcing themselves for that guest to no avail @ 5 AM, effectively waking up everyone in the surrounding rooms. Finally, I had requested a late check out at time of booking and when I checked in and they told me it would be no problem, just advise them the day before we leave. So, the day before we were to leave, I advised the front desk of my request and they told me it would be an additional $240 to stay until 3 PM otherwise I had to be out by Noon. Great customer service on their part since that was the first time I was told that I had to pay for the day to stay a mere 3 hours longer. Had I known that at the time of booking I would have book an earlier flight home for us. That said, I would pick another hotel before I stayed at the Rio again.

Basically you get $200 worth of food for $180. When you eat at any of the Harrah's properties you send the tab to your room. When you check ou they are supposed to apply the credit to your account. However the host in the Prefered room where we checked out and knew nothing. If you are a Platinum or higher player you already get a discount. The food plan still needs tweeking.

I am glad we stayed in the Inpanema tower as we overheard another man who was staying in the Masquerade tower say he had a wonderful view of the new Saphire Pool, which is topless. Not my taste but maybe for others. The Rio does not cater to kids of any age. There is not an arcade and the bowling alley does not allow anyone under the age of 21 after 9 p.m. We noticed that the Rio no longer does their little show daily and its only performed Thursday-Sundays starting approx. 9 p.m. The show has gotten VERY VERY loud and the routine is quite RISQUE!! Not something for the children to see. In between acts you can also catch a glimpse of some of the Chipendales that come out and for a fee you can grab a picture and grab alot whole lot more :) We ate at the new Rub BBQ and it was just OK. The staff is friendly and heavly tattooed but the food is just ok. Service was great. Its nice to have to be off strip where it tends to be a little more quiter but the tables are really expensive. We did not see a blackjack table that was less than $25 and that was at 10 a.m. We had no problems getting a drink, if you ask for a double you will enjoy the three ounces of liquid a little more. The tables were staffed with friendly dealers and the pit bosses were socialable as well. Take advantage of the \"free\" shuttle back to the strip to the other Harrah's properties. The drivers are nice and fun so don't forget the tip. There are a couple of pools outside and the big pool is FREEZING!! Even in 105 degree heat they must pump cold water into that pool.

Over all I\u2019d highly recommend the Rio for a couple or a family to stay at Las Vegas. We went on this trip to see The Phantom (at the Venetian) and were not disappointed as the show was out of this world fantastic, but after hiking through the Venetian and its shops, Wynn and its shops, Bellagio and its shops and all of the Caesar\u2019s Mall (I recommend the Italian Pizza at Spago), it was nice to get back and rest in the comfort of the Rio.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cRoom stained and old\u201d", "Author": "jsgb", "ReviewID": "UR18218167", "Content": "Our room was in the Masquerade Tower.

I was especially disappointed with the pool area. I believe there's a total of four pools, but they kept one of them closed all the time, and the ones that were open were on the filthy side. Of course, the Sapphire pool was in good shape, but you had to pay $30 to get in because a bunch of tired strippers sun bathed topless there. On top of the cover, expect to have your wallet raped as if you were in the strip club itself. Drinks are obnoxiously high. They give you drink coupons outside, then they don't honor them when you get in. My naive friends found out the hard way, when they ran a tab (big mistake) of over $200 for a couple buckets of beer and a few cocktails. The rooms weren't spectacular but they were clean, and the beds were very comfortable. Considering that I wasn't in Vegas to stay in a hotel room, the whole time, it was fine. Didn't eat that much in the hotel. Late night sandwich at Rub was mediocre; lunch at Great American Grill was pretty good. TIP: Since the hotel gives you a fridge separate from the mini-bar fridge, take advantage of it and go to a convenience store to buy water / beer or whatever.

If you are not visiting for the pool this is a good value if you are getting a discounted rate.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a work conference but maybe not leisure\u201d", "Author": "ttiottn1", "ReviewID": "UR16710740", "Content": "I stayed at the Rio all-suite hotel & casino May 20-23 for a work conference. First my disclaimer: I would not choose Vegas as a vacation destination on my own time because I don\u2019t gamble at all and am not interested in sitting indoors watching shows. With that, overall the Rio was one of the nicest conference hotels I have stayed at. My conf room rate was $179/night ($195.11 w/all fees/taxes). My room was on the 4th floor of the Masquerade tower with a \u201cmountain view\u201d. Well being on the 4th floor, I had a slight view of the mountains but a much better view of the heating/cooling equipment mounted on top of the 3rd floor. That was fine with me since I did not get my room for the view; I\u2019m sure higher floors had a much better view. The room was clean and well maintained except for cobwebs on the ceiling behind the curtains; I guess they think guests would never look behind the curtains. I requested a non-smoking room but because they don\u2019t guarantee that request, I was given a smoking room. Luckily I am not overly sensitive to smoke because it definitely smelt like smoke. On the 2nd day I noticed vents could be opened below the windows to allow outside air in and that helped rid the room of the smell. The room/suite was plenty big for up to 4 people; mine had a king bed with an L shaped couch and coffee table along with a desk and chair. The TV was a good size and worked just fine though the channel selection was lacking; no Comedy Central, Food Network, Animal Planet, etc. The refrigerator was plenty big, a wee bit bigger than dorm size, and worked just fine; no microwave. The bathroom and sitting area with sink were also a good size. The shower water pressure and temperature were top notch. The closet and dresser space was adequate for two people but more than that would have been cramped. The bed and linens were comfortable and I slept without any problems. Housekeeping did an excellent job every day of cleaning the room thoroughly and promptly. The heat/cool unit was top notch; it worked very quickly & quietly to heat/cool the room; very nice! Plus the room itself was very sound proof. Although I saw neighbors come and go from adjacent rooms, I never heard them or anyone else, ever. Excellent! The hotel is a complex itself with lots of opportunities for gambling and eating. The pool area is excellent though it was closed one day of my stay because of \u201chigh winds\u201d. The conference accommodations were acceptable but it was a 10 min walk from my room to the session rooms so those with mobility issues might have a problem with this. One night I ate at the All American Bar & Grill; see my review there for details. The free Masquerade Show in the Sky was back but I did not get a chance to check it out. Again, I don\u2019t gamble so cannot tell you about that aspect though there were lots of opportunities for it everywhere. I am giving the Rio 4 stars and not 5 for a number of reasons. First, the staff overall were not that friendly. Again, housekeeping was excellent as was one gal at the front desk. But the concierge, another front desk person and the conf hotel staff were not. Second is its location. It is off the strip on the \u201cother side\u201d of the interstate and because of the location/neighborhood, you can NOT walk to the strip. In fact, when I asked the concierge if I could walk in the area outside the hotel, she just replied, \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d The Rio does offer multiple free shuttles to their \u201csister\u201d hotels on the strip but they fill up fast so you may have to wait for more than one and they only run until 1am. Yes, you can take a cab but they are expensive. Finally, I don\u2019t think it is a good value. Yes the hotel and my room were top notch but I don\u2019t think worth just under $200/night. I think you can find a better value closer to the strip. So all in all if another work conference was located at this hotel, I would most definitely stay here again. But on the very off chance I would visit Vegas on vacation, I would not stay here; I would choose something on or walkable to the strip and less expensive.

They have the best flare bartenders we saw in all of Vegas. They were super friendly and between the bartender shows and the Masquerade in the Sky show you could be entertained all night. We also loved the seafood buffet - that is a must if you like seafood. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a family with children because the shows are somewhat risque for kids but for adults they are very entertaining. It is a great off-strip hotel and the shuttles did seem to run very much on schedule and you never had to wait an excessive amount of time. When you do have to wait for the shuttle at Harrah's the waiting area is inside the parking garage where there are a ton of tour buses and cars - it gets very hot and the exhaust smell can get to you - I would reccomend taking the shuttle to any of the other hotels and walking instead of waiting for that one.

First, I must say that amount of luxury you get here for your money, for all Europeans must be unbelievable. For 190$/night at Rio, I've had suite of about 100 square meters, with two baths, one huge living room with kitchenete, office desk, eating table, huge plasma TV, bedroom with jacuzzi in in it, also with huge plasma TV, and en suite bath also had smaller plasma TV. Mini bar was most versatile I've ever found in some hotel, and prices of things inside (as the room service menu too), were very,very cheap for european standards. For example, during my visit to Berlin last year, I've payed about 140 Eur (okay,with breakfast), in 4 star hotel with 20 square meters room, with bathroom you can hardly turn around in. And all this in Rio was about 120 Eur!! Speaking about staff and all other things usually conected with hotel reviews, well it's not important in Vegas hotels. They are all huge, you don't get so much in touch with staff, they will clean your room every day, they will bring you your room service order, they will give you all informations at the desk. That's it, and what else do you need in Vegas. Hotel location is a bit off the Strip (main street in Vegas), but then again, not far neither. Abot 20 minutes walk, or 5-10 min by taxi. Place you must visit if you staying here is a open sky club, called Voodoo Lounge on the hotel roof (54 floor), with a great view on Vegas at night. At the end, I may understand our fellow Americans and some remarks they may have for this hotel, but they are probably a bit spoiled. :) If they come in Western Europe, and see what kind of room and service they can get in center of Berlin, Paris or Rome for 190$ (120 Euros/night), they can have unpleasant surprise. They can have decent hotel, but something like this for sure not. Not even close.

The reason this made this hotel one of my worst stays is, on the third night, the power went out at 2am. I was in my room watching TV and it took me a minute to realize that the power was out. I just don't expect something like that to happen. I called the front desk and they were very nonchalant about it, telling me it would be fixed in an hour. I am not a person to easily scare, but it was an hour that I was really scared, which is unacceptable to me when I am suppose to be safely in my room, watching TV, and getting some sleep before the tradeshow the next day. The part that really ticked me off is the next day when I found out that it was a planned power outage for some renovations they were working on. Why would a hotel like that not leave a note in each room notifying the guest, so it wasn't so surprising? I bet their slot machines were not shut down for that hour. GRRR. Then, when I checked out, I complained at the front desk about it, and the guy told me that I should go to the Harrah's website and complain and maybe they would send me a check back...I doubt that will happen very much. Why didn't he do something right then to make it right? I did try the website, but funny, there was no section to make a complaint or comment. I thought they handled the whole thing very unprofessionally and they didn't even attempt to make it right when I did complain.

After watching a Fox News hidden camera report several months back about hotel house keeping staff in numerous national hotels violating health code standards by hand washing guest room drinking glasses in the bathroom sinks with dirty towels, I thought I would put Rio to the test. After marking two used drinking glasses in my room with ink, I left them on the counter to be replaced by the house keeping staff. Later, after the room had purportedly been cleaned, the same glasses were placed back on the shelf, with the ink marks still clearly visible. It was apparent to me they had not been sanitized according to the hotel's stated sanitizing procedures. Could this mean that when a guest checks out, this same method of glass cleaning (a violation of the hotel's stated standard operating procedures) occurs while preparing the room for the next guest? When I brought it to the attention of one of the managers, he stated how embarrassed he was and made assurances it would not happen again. He then appeared to attempt to rationalize the unsanitary conditions by stating that I would likely find the same glass washing practices at other hotels on the Las Vegas strip, albeit a health code violation. He said he could not possibly monitor the cleaning methods of \"all 500\" of his house keeping staff. He further stated that there were some problems with the house keeping training program that probably needed to be reviewed. I filed a complaint with the local health department which, within days, conducted in an inspection at Rio. According to the inspector who conducted the inspection, not removing dirty drinking glasses from a room and replacing them with properly sanitized glasses is a health code violation. She went on to say that she has \u201cconcerns with the glass handling process\u201d at Rio and that those concerns \u201cwill be addressed\u201d by the health department. Other cleanliness issues in my room included a \"clean\" hand towel placed in my room that had a large black apparent grease stain on it; a clogged shower drain and hair (not my own) found in the purportedly newly changed bed sheets.

I have been to Vegas on at least 20 occasions stretching back to my early childhood, so I've had plenty of experience with visiting and staying in the tourist areas --this was my first visit for business so I opted to stay at the conference hotel for simplicity's sake (and the discount). The title says it all: I was in the Masquerade Tower and the room was surprisingly large, even for a suite. Looking at the floor plan on the fire-escape chart shows all the rooms were of similar size. The furnishings were functional, though nothing exceptional. There was the feature of a small window at face-level between the shower and the bedroom (you would easily be able to watch tv from the shower). There were two sinks (in in the bathroom and one immediately outside) and the overall room was good for a business traveler. They charge for internet access, as a business traveler I used it but I think the idea is still silly. I requested non-smoking, but by 5pm they had only smoking rooms and offered to move me in the morning (which, from other reviews, appears to be the norm --I guess they should make more non-smoking rooms!). The smell in my room wasn't bad, though I noticed it more in the morning. Like many of the resorts in Vegas, the elevators are tucked away from the front desk so you can walk through the sounds, lights and (hopefully for them) allure of gambling. Since it opened, the Rio has featured a very large buffet --hearkening back to when Vegas was known far more for its buffets; thankfully, those days are finally passing us. As far as normal restaurants, I recommend Gaylord Indian Restaurant, which is part of a famous international chain of fine Indian restaurants --it is part of the more recent trend of world famous restaurants and chefs opening locations in Sin City (which I wholeheartedly approve of). There were two Starbucks Coffees, one large one within close range of the conference facilities. They also have a roof-top bar with patio that offers a spectacular view of the city, and that's about it... The casino itself has a few free shows, the highlight is an elaborate dance number in the Masquerade Tower lobby where people start on a stage and are joined by several massive floats suspended by the ceiling and moving around on a track. By itself, its impressive, but on the Las Vegas-scale it amounts to a decent effort. The good thing about being off the strip is that any room facing the strip is usually going to have a good view --and that was the case here. Despite being only on the fourth floor, the view was pleasant --mostly of Caeser's, Bellagio and the upcoming CityCenter mega-complex (one of the few times where \"mega\" isn't an hyperbole). Because the Rio abuts the freeway, the views are safe for the long run. With that said, the worst aspect of the Rio is the location. Being off-strip might be great if you're focused on simply gambling (and in that case there are several better options), but if you're interested in seeing the city (for the first time or on the 20-something time like me), it is a bit of a hassle. Since day one, the Rio has had a regular shuttle to the strip to mitigate the annoyance; now that its a part of the Harrah's empire, the shuttles have expanded to take guests to several properties, including Harrah's and Caeser's Palace (the service ends relatively early for a city that never sleeps). If you're a tourist, this may not be the greatest option if you can find better prices on the strip. Many Las Vegas hotels have one cardinal issue: there's no free shuttle to the airport. I don't know what politics are involved, but its a glaring issue in light of their other guest-friendly hospitality (free shuttles, free valet, etc). The Rio is at least more convenient to McCarran International: my cab rides (with tip) were $25 there and $18 back. The funny thing about Vegas hotels is if you plopped any one of them into a city, they'd be spectacular --including this complex which, in Vegas, is about average. Would I stay here again?

I drove around the property for 20 minutes and finally asked a valet, but he didn't know where it was either. I finally parked and went in the casino and asked at the front desk.

(I've noticed many people have mentioned this) It looks like there was some sort of bachelor party shenanigans going on with the couch, if you get my drift. The bathroom was very clean, which is a big sticking point for me. The one weird aspect of the bathroom was the window in the shower out to the main part of the room. I'm not sure what the purpose of this was -- am I supposed to be looking out the window out the windows or watching something going on in the bedroom, or what? (See photo) At any rate, it kept me from having the bathroom light on at night to make the trip to the bathroom safe (ambient light) and I've been sporting a large bruise on my arm ever since. Overall, after touring several other hotels (Wynn, Bellagio, Mirage) I would say that the Rio is more of a clean budget property.

I trust this will be beneficial. First of all, Vegas is simply incredible. The sheer size of the buildings is overwhelming. Hence, all the talk about all the walking people do. HINT: wear tennis shoes. Check-in was easy, since my friend that invited me is a Diamond Member. We waited approximately 15 minutes on a Saturday night @ midnight. The other lines appeared to be the same. We got a standard room in the Masquerade Tower with a great view of the strip and The Palms, which is what they call a suite, which is a really large room with sofa w/ chaise lounge, a table and two chairs, coffee table, large 32\" TV and large bathroom. There is a dressing area outside the bathroom with its own sink, which I really liked. The room appears to be a bit tired and run down. This is especially evident in all the stains in the sofa, carpet, etc. Casino - is very nice and offers all the games and lots of them. I enjoy playing craps. I'm not used to playing $25 minimums, but it is Vegas. I only noticed at 4AM a $10 table and once it filled up they changed it to a $25 table. They have great crews, who are helpful and the drink service was mostly good. Only a couple of times I waited 30 minutes to 1 hour without seeing one. One should obtain a Total Rewards card, because they will send you comps and coupons. Golf - We played Bear's Best Golf Club, which is only about a 15-20 minute cab ride and it was unbelievable. Great conditions, wonderful Forecaddie, and beautiful scenery. This is a must play. We wanted to play Rio Secco, but it was closed for their overseeding. Restaurants - The carnival buffet is pretty good for breakfast and I really liked the restaurant next to the sports bar...they had a great burger. The Voodoo Restaurant is pricey, but good. The beef filet is okay at best, but the shrimp was some of the best I've ever had. After dinner, be sure to go outside to the Voodoo lounge and take some pics of the BEST VIEW of the STRIP...period. If your younger than me, 35, than this may be worth paying the cover to party. The scene is definately a younger crowd ~ 20's, than me. Pool - is really nice with attractive cocktail servers, who were rather slow, but they were also very busy. Drinks are very expensive. The water was FREEZING. I couldn't stand it. It is 105 degrees and it was ICE COLD. Several people were in the pool, but I couldn't stand it. Hip-hop type mix music was unique including rock and alternative rock songs that were transformed into dance mix/house music. FUNKY! All in all - I would recommend the RIO Hotel and Casino for a Guys or Girls trip, who are in their 20's, and may be on a budget. As for being off strip, The Rio is only separated from Caesar's Palace by the Interstate, which is the heart of the strip. A free shuttle takes you to where you want to go.

We drove around for half an hour before finding someone who was pulling out in a structure and level far away from the hotel.

She gave us a room with one bed instead of two as I had requested months ago when I booked the room and told us the hotel doesn't guarantee room requests. That makes me wonder why we are even asked our preference at booking instead of when checking in. What's the point? Once we were in the room we found that the bulb in the bathroom was burnt out. To the staff's credit, they acted immediately when we called. We left the hotel for a few hours and when we returned that evening and tried to play some of the machines, they weren't registering our Player's Cards so we couldn't get points for our play.

I was quite upset with my stay so far at the Rio and told the manager all the troubles we'd had for which he said he would comp us the water in the mini-bar so we could brush our teeth. That's it? Two over-priced Aquafinas for our terrible stay? I've never had such bad service at any Harrah's hotel. I'd been eager to try the Rio as I hadn't stayed there before and was sorely disappointed.

After finishing unpacking we start looking at the couch and it has big stains like you wouldn\u2019t believe the type that under low light weren\u2019t to noticeable but when you turn all the lights on were very noticeable. I pulled out the table chair and it looked as if someone sat there and done their business. I put a towel over it and decided to deal with it in the AM. Kimberly suggested we stop by the front desk on the way to do a little gambling and let them know about the condition of our room so we would not be charged extra for damage or cleaning fee. Stopped at the front desk and talked to a different clerk who was upset at the condition of our room and poked around her computer an low and behold she had a room in the newly refurbished Impenana (sp) Tower with a king bed no less and produced to Passes to the Voodoo Lounge for us. She also didn\u2019t remark at what great Rates we had managed to acquire. Thirty Minutes Later we were being escorted by another bellman with Luggage in tow to a beautiful room on the 14th floor. CDS \u201cO\u201d if you have not seen it you are missing out on an experience of a lifetime Kimberly and I were mesmerized by the beauty, athleticism, and sheer man power it took to put on a performance of this caliber. I would try to explain it here but it would not do it justice and I do not have the vocabulary to put the experience into words. Day trip to Mt. Charleston is well worth the Hour it took to drive there, it is very beautiful, and quite wild to leave the dessert floor and drive up to a snow covered mountain. Great little restaurant and lodge at the top with nice hiking trails, which we did not go up do to the snow and lack of proper attire. Best Meal we had was at Smith & Woulensky\u2019s probably one of the top two steaks my wife has ever had and the best Lobster Tail I have ever had (tristan Island Tail). Bring your appetite and Wallet. Worst Meal (almost) we tried Rosewood grill on the strip and it was nice on the inside but besides us there was only one other table, the menu did not grab us but the had a lobster Fritter appetizer that sounded great, Well lets just say that we took one bite each and almost got sick. It was not cooked thoroughly on the inside and the ingredients looked as if they were the left over form someone else\u2019s dinner. We sent it back paid our tab and got the heck out of there. All and all it was a great trip and we will be back to Vegas but we will probably try a Different hotel next time.

My husband and I decided to stay at a suite in Las Vegas. Since the Venetian was way too expensive, we chose Rio. The first problem with this hotel is that it is not on the strip and it is not walking distance. So your options are your car, taxi or the hotel shuttle which is every half hour to the strip. The casino is pretty small and due to low ceilings, cigarette smoke is overpowering. I have been to Vegas for years and several times each year but this was horrible. Our room was non-smoking but the people next door smoked so we had to deal with the stink. The room had a beautiful view of the mountains but... it really is not a suite. It is just a large room. The bed is in the same room as the couch with one TV. The third problem was the food. We were told that the buffet at this hotel is the best in Las Vegas. Except that we are not big eaters and just wanted to have a nice meal in a restaurant instead. There are italian, indian, japanese and american menu restaurants. They are all over-priced and not very popular with the guests eventhough the hotel was sold-out. We decided to eat at the All American and were extremly disappointed. The food was all fried, there was only one type of vegetarian plate which was the mushroom burger. My husband's hamburger was raw inside and the potatoes were very greasy and too fried. On Sunday my husband wanted to watch football at the Rio sports book and there was another disappointment because the TV screens were not large, the seats closest to the small TV's were all taken and the people without seats could barely see anything because they had to stand behind a wall to watch the various games. He ended up at Caesar's Palace Sports book instead. We pretty much spent the rest of our 4 days at casinos and restaurants outside of Rio and regretted booking our room there.", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201c24 hours of fun, fun, and more fun\u201d", "Author": "Rachelsara", "ReviewID": "UR11507484", "Content": "What a great hotel.

It's a fine place to stay if you are a gambler; however, I attended a business convention hosted at the site. It shouldn't have been a surprise to me that this place is geared to gamblers, but I was surprised by the inconvenience that caused me. First of all, here is what I liked about the hotel: 1. The room was immaculate. Except for a used bar of soap I found in the shower left over from the last guest who stayed in the room, housekeeping did a great job. 2. The staff was very friendly. The concierege who helped me throughout my stay was amazing, and the people who worked in parking were very nice. 3. There was a very good selection of restaurants. I ate at the same place twice during my stay (All-American Bar & Grill), and the food was excellent. 4. Parking is free. What I didn't like about the hotel: 1. I needed cash for a shuttle to the airport. To withdraw $20 from the ATM was going to cost me $4.99. If you are like me, you will walk to an ATM near the hotel. The closest one was about 1/2 of a mile. There was a grocery store a little further down the road then that. 2. There is a fitness center, but it costs $22 to use it as it is part of the spa. If you work out three days, then you get a discount on the third day. 3. I paid $1.25 for each toll free call I made. 4. The cocktail waitresses are dressed in outfits you will not see at Disneyland. In fairness to the Rio the other casino hotels probably have similar policies. The convention I attended is being hosted at a different casino hotel next year. If I attend, I will probably stay at a non-casino hotel such as the Westin. I will, however, be sure to ask questions about the things I didn't like to find the best possible arrangement.

The hotel/casino is big enough to not get too bored if you're not staying on the strip and they have very convenient free shuttle services that stop at Bally's, Caesar's Palace, and Paris, I believe. The spa here is tops here for a good hot rock massage with \"Frenchie\". I highly recommend her, she's the best masseuse I've experienced yet. The only thing I thought was so-so here was the pedicure I got, just \"Ok\", nothing special. The room itself we stayed in was OK, decent views, but on our first day in, in the afternoon, it seemed like the room next door had a party going. We could hear LOTs of voices, sounded like very young adutls/teens, and I could hear them right through the walls. I had never encountered a noise problem through any walls at any previous Vegas hotel I've stayed at. Fortunately, it must've been their last day there and I never heard a peep for the remainder of our trip. There are many fine dining options at the Rio as well. I recommend their open cafe (can't remember the name) that's right by the casino--they have the BEST burgers. Also I would recommend going to Buzio's, a seafood restaurant there.

Arrived about 10:00pm Wednesday evening and only the \"regular\" suites were available. Compared with a regular hotel room our room was fairly large but it definitely was NOT a suite. We requested in advance and confirmed at the front desk a room with a pull-out sofa. The front desk clerk was very helpful and I think did try to find us a larger room. Unfortunately the sofa wasn't a sleeper; the front desk suggested a roll-away bed, I said OK but then had a long argument with housekeeping about linens. Apparently they have a rule that no room can receive more than 6 pillows. A very official-looking lady with a walkie-talkie came to the room (it's 11:00 pm Pacific time at this point) and, said that basically there was no way we were getting more pilows. OK..... Otherwise the room was fine - the floor to ceiling windows were very nice and, even though our view was of the parking deck, it did make the room appear larger. The furnishings were nice and (king) bed comfortable. There was a small-ish closet, mini-refrigerator (very handy and uncommon) and large bathroom. The hotel facilities were OK: all of the pools except one were closed due to the season but it was very nice. There are several restaurants but they all are very pricey and a poor value (as with most other Vegas hotel restaurants). I would recommend the VooDoo Steak Lounge. While expensive, there is a great view and access to the outdoor deck with a great atmosphere. The gaming areas were typical but a little more spread-out than most casinos. As others have posted, I found that the table minimums were high - $25 for blackjack, for example. I found most of the staff to be surprisingly pleasant. Maybe I've gotten used to poor service but I constantly heard \"good morning\", \"how are you\", \"have a good day\", etc. - refreshing. The valet parking was inconveniently located (especially when carrying luggage) and during busy times there were long delays in retrieving our car. One recurring theme was that there was a constant level of higher services, amemenities, and facilities for high-level members of the gaming Rewards Club - a different line for the buffet, the ability to call the valet and have your car brought around, different valet-drop-off lane, preferred seating, better rooms, etc. Even when going to the theatre will-call to pick up telephone-purchsed tickets I was asked what level of Rewards I was.

We occasionally get offers/free rooms from Harrah's hotels and the Rio had the best deal for the timeframe of our trip. It's been 10 years since we've stayed here and I think the property's changed for the better. We were on the 16th floor of the Ipanema tower in a newly renovated room. I loved this room (not a suite, however much the hotel chooses to call their rooms suites). You first walk into a small marble foyer with a refrigerator/coffeemaker nook then straight into the large room that held a large corduroy covered sofa, a very comfortable easy chair, a marble topped coffee table and a good sized work desk. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable and had soft linens and a duvet. The bathroom had a pedestal sink--it was separated by a door from a larger sink and vanity area. This area also had a built-in chest of drawers and large closet. All in all, I'd say this was one of the better designed and most comfortable motel rooms I've stayed in for a long time. Some Vegas hotels, like the Venetian, have larger rooms (ie suites), but this was so livable and nice to come 'home' to at night. The room itself was sparkling clean and very convenient to elevators. I liked the Rio's layout. It's not huge so it's very easy to navigate. The little sports cafe connected to the Sports book had good food and it was easy to grab a bite or take it up to the room. We had late night breakfast in the All-American Grille--pretty inexpensive. We also ate at the Seafood Buffet our first night there. The slipper lobster was soooo good. At $36.95, though, it's pricey. I was pleasantly surprised at the drink service while gambling--no joke, friendly servers came around at least every 5-10 minutes, even around the penny machines. Slots were no tighter here than anywhere else--in fact, I won $500 on a dollar machine our last night there. The Rio has it all--except for location. Honestly, that's the deal-breaker for me.

This section of the casino has a bowling alley with some GREAT quick foods to eat. We also ended up using Room Service one night and they came in and set up our table with linens and everything. The food was FABULOUS! It was worth the money and we would definitely stay there again. We did get to go to the pool one day and it is an okay pool. there are actually 4 different pools with one of them having sand. There are at least 2 hot tubs but they were not very hot while we were there. Because of the time of year (late September) they said that it was the slow season and all the pools were open at 5pm when we got there. Also, all of the pools were going to close at 6pm. It's typical of the pools to close by 7pm but since it was the off season they closed early because of the small amount of guests. Just something to know so you know what to expect.

They had a stocked mini frig under the TV and an empty mini frig(no temp adjustment)in the closet. We had the cabbie stop at a minimart on the way to the hotel so we put our things in the empty frig.

I did pick up breakfast snacks and chocolate. DO NOT buy chocolate bars at the Rio $2 a pop and they are OLD. Go to Grocer for chocolate. The view was a nice one. We could see the Gold Coast, the Palms, the Orleans and the distant hills. No problem with the AC. The bathroom was ok. The frig was cold enough. The TV was huge. Rio supplies 3 shuttles to and from 3 casinos about every 20 mins. 1 for Bally's, 1 for Harrah's and 1 for Ceasar's. Drivers were very friendly, polite and helpful.

The young man checking me in made a quick call and got us into a suite on the 20th floor of the Ipanema tower. The suite was amazing. Nice dining area, guest bathroom, view of the South Strip, HUGE master bath with jacuzzi tub, his/hers robes and sandals, pretty impressive. Only drawbacks were the old TV's that had issues with color and the smell of smoke. Enjoyed our brief time at the pool. Plenty of space and some fun areas for kids to play if you bring them along. We're not gamblers so can't really comment on the gambling scene. Drinks are fairly expensive ($8-9 for mixed drinks, $6 for beer). We only ate at Antonio's and had our worst dining experience in Vegas. The burnt parmesan chicken would not have been served at Olive Garden and would have been about $30 cheaper. I had heard about the incredible views from the VooDoo Lounge and it did not disappoint. It has to be one of the better views of the Strip. Here is a tip: Don't pay the $20/person cover charge! In many of the shops in the Rio, there are VooDoo Lounge buisness cards by the registers that serve as free admission if used before 10:30 PM on Sunday-Friday. We had a great stay at the Rio but are obviously biased due to the upgrade to the top floor suite. We were impressed with the pools, VooDoo lounge and hated Antonio's.

The casino atmosphere is great. I love the layout. The Carnival in the sky in the back casino area is a great thing to experience. Everytime I have friends with me I take them there to see this. If you dont know this is an attraction that consists of floats supended from the ceiling and they entertain with dancing and music all themed together. They also have a stage that risses from the floor in the same area that goes with the floats. This is an all free show just for people to enjoy. The rooms... If you want a romantic night and be in one of those rooms you see in the magazines with the wonderful skyline outside of the window... this is it. The rooms are all suites and they are big and have floor to ceiling windows and if you book it right you can have a strip view. With the hotel not being on the strip you get a veiw that is worth a million dollars. My friend got married and was going to stay at the Bellagio. Even though it was his honeymoon he did not want to stay in the room 24hrs a day and he wanted to have some money left over. I suggested the Rio and he got one of their standard rooms. He came back thanking me. He took my advice and got a strip view room and he said it was sooooo romantic and he and his new wife has a great time. He loved the little window that is in the shower that looks out into the room. The rooms all have very large sofas that have lounging areas on the end and bed is situated where if you leave the curtains open at night you have an unforgetable view. The entertainment has since been changed. They used to have Club Rio in the show room and they had 80's night. I am an 80's nut and the entertainment was awesome. Not sure how the entertainment is set now but they always seemed to be able to entertain well. They still have the VooDoo lounge that is on top of the tower and you dont want to miss it.

It was clean, carpet had stains, a little dust. people who complain ac does not work good etc, why not call and ask for another room rather than suffering through it. Hallways were clean, elevators sometimes a little slow. The casino is big and very very cold in some parts. I had to wear a jacket most of the time. It also has changed to many penny machines but did have dollar areas too. I did ok sometimes but ended up loosing at rio. The slot attendants were all very nice, i think they have to be at a harrahs property. The come over right away if you need help or you can press number 1 on the area where you put your players card in and i guess it signals them. When they come over they have to put their card in to turn it off, so they come fast. They always tell you their name and tell you if you need anything to please ask. So i think harrahs has given extensive training in this area which is great. It was the same way at harrahs on the strip and ballys which is owned by harrahs. That was very impressive I thought, made you feel good, like you were being treated special. I would not stay hear for i would prefer a strip location for the same price. The rooms are priced the same as Rio if not some of them a bit cheaper. I would stay on the strip hands down. The food at the place that\u2019s right in the casino ( i forget the name) was very good.

My 4-year old was entranced with the lights and action in the casino. She enjoyed the sky shows so much I think they were the highlight of the trip. Once we reached reception check-in was smooth and my daughter received a set of beads. She was over the moon. We had a spacious suite on an upper floor. The two queen beds were not particularly comfortable nor were the pillows. For the most part, we enjoyed the room but the air conditioning was anemic and never really cooled the room. Given our young traveler we were most interested in the pool. I was surprised at the 9am-6pm posted pool hours. I thought with the blast furnace like heat it would be nice to spend the evening in the pool. In any case, the pool area is beautiful and crowded. You will want desk shoes in the summer heat. The deck was very hot. Some people had rented cabanas and had floating pool mats that looked fun. I didn\u2019t locate the source of the pool mats but it was just as well. I only had my room key and you need ID and the charge slip they provide at check-in for extras. They had a bar poolside if I had only brought my ID! I would caution people about the quality of life-guarding at this pool and at others I have seen in Las Vegas. The guards appear mostly decorative. The number of potential hazards in these pools would be unacceptable to most health clubs or public pools. Few of the guards scan the waters with any regularity and given the shape of these pools it is hard to imagine they can effectively view their entire zone. I have never seen a guard caution against the unsafe behaviors that abound in and near the pools. I enjoyed the pools but would not count on the lifeguards. We had dinner at the buffet after wandering past most of the other restaurant options. I think the buffet is fine for a buffet. The masses were ushered from their holding pens to their tables. Non-alcoholic drink options were presented and the server disappeared. This is also a good time to request ketchup as you may never see your server again. As most foodies understand, buffet food is problematic. There are endless choices of mediocre options. Most look good but are less tasty than they would be following sitting on a buffet. I suggest choosing foods that sit well or that are made to order. The pizza was a little too sweet for my tastes. The fired foods were good as were the ice cream sundaes. The Mexican options were pretty good but the BBQ suffered, as it hadn\u2019t been cooked low and slow. It seemed they had drink specials for about 30 minutes on the hour. The Mojitos were pretty good. I was disappointed to learn that the fitness room cost $22 a day to use but did come with Spa access. This sort of arrangement is apparently common in Las Vegas, huh.

Myself and my partner were there as he was playing in the World Series of Poker and it was very convenient for this. If you are staying at this hotel then don\u2019t be too worried. Some of the reviews on here make you think that it will be awful, but it truly isn\u2019t. The last hotel that we stayed in was the Wynn, so we had high expectations and in no way does the Rio compare to this hotel, but it is adequate. The Room (Ours was in the Ipanema Tower) and was newly refurbished. On the positive side, it was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. There is a really good dressing area with huge wardrobes and a hairdryer. Our room also had a coffee pot and fridge, which was useful. The TV unit is great as it hides away whilst not in use. On the negative side \u2013 our room was on the fifth floor and the view was terrible \u2013 it was of the air conditioning units and the food delivery site \u2013 therefore no amazing sights of the strip were seen! The bathroom is tiny. The door opens inwards and nearly touches the toilet. There is barely room to get dried without your towel touching the toilet bowl. The shower is fixed to the wall so you cannot wash properly and it drenches your hair (they don\u2019t provide shower caps unless you ask, so get some from housekeeping). Despite being refurbished many items haven\u2019t been replaced \u2013 all the sockets and light switches are old and yellow \u2013 the bathroom fixtures are old and dirty (there is ingrained black in the tiles and grout etc. I asked housekeeping to give the bathroom a good scrub, but it wouldn\u2019t come off!! It certainly wasn\u2019t luxurious and my bathroom at home is much better. The windows were filthy \u2013 but with us having such a bad view this wasn\u2019t a problem as we didn\u2019t look outside much! The worst thing is how thin the walls are. We were woken up on numerous occasions by our neighbours. I know it is Vegas, so you have to expect noise, but to hear sounds through my earplugs was a bit of a joke really. Especially given that on one occasion we were kept awake for over two hours by a \u201clady of the night\u201d if you know what I mean. We did ask to move rooms, but the front desk were unhelpful and did nothing. Luckily the two guys involved were checking out that day so it didn\u2019t happen again. The Pool Gorgeous. No problems at all. Plenty of beds, adequate shade and glorious surroundings. Cabanas are good value at $250 a day. Drinks are very expensive round the pool, but bring your own! There are hidden whirlpools and sand and waterfalls. It is truly lovely. There is music played all day \u2013 not to everyone\u2019s taste, but you can easily bring your own ipod or block it out. No complaints. Restaurants Sports Kitchen \u2013 not really a restaurant, more a snack bar, but serving freshly made pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs. Very nice, very quick and very convenient. All American Bar & Grill \u2013 You can either sit in the bar area or in the restaurant (where the prices are more expensive). We chose the restaurant each time \u2013 very nice. Fabulous food and service. The steaks are out of this world! You are also given fresh bread and butter before your meal and this is gorgeous too \u2013 though does fill you up!! Lots of people were taking doggy bags away with them. Each steak is served with fresh veg and choice of potato \u2013 all delicious. Carnival World Buffet - Tried this for breakfast, brunch and dinner. Breakfast is by far the best time to visit. Fresh fruit, smoked salmon, tea/coffee, freshly made to order omlettes, bacon and eggs \u2013gorgeous. There is everything you could wish for and some items that are a bit strange for brekkie \u2013 such as tacos (?) and oodles of deserts & icecream. Brunch (after 11am) was a bit disappointing as all the breakfast items disappear to be replaced with Chinese and Mexican etc. Dinner was much of the same \u2013 with everything you could wish for. I loved this buffet. I miss it like mad!! Sao Paulo Caf\u00e9 \u2013 Had the two egg breakfast here and was disappointed. I ended up thinking that I should have gone to the buffet instead. Ate lunch here twice \u2013 both times excellent. The chicken noodle soup is gorgeous. They do freshly fired spit roasted chickens, which are lovely. Big portions, but not outfacing. Room service -Had this once due to my hangover from the Voodoo Lounge. Very nice. Food delivered in 45 minutes and was nicely presented and hot. Had the chicken noodle soup again and a club sandwich. No complaints. Voodoo Lounge Unbelievable. If you are staying at the Rio then visit here at least once. The views are unrivalled. We arrived at 7pm so were lucky enough to see the view in the daylight and after dark. The atmosphere is amazing. I would definitely go back here. We were lucky enough not to have to pay for drinks (free bar) so I can\u2019t comment on the price of drinks I\u2019m afraid. It is an amazing place. You get in a lift and you go so high \u2013 its exhilarating. Casino Yes, it is noisy and smoky. The free show gets tired pretty quickly \u2013 not too much to do here really. The gaming floor is always busy. We didn\u2019t gamble much \u2013 I learnt to play Craps over at the Gold Coast (which is just over the road to the Rio) $5 minimum verses $25 at Rio \u2013 I know which I prefer! It\u2019s a terrific game and we made so much money! They should definitely start this up in the UK! What I did think was amusing at the Rio is the \u201cbevertainers\u201d ie the waiters/waitresses who have to sing on podiums scattered around at intervals. Its very embarrassing for them \u2013 their outfits are also very scant \u2013 they must be freezing as the air con is pretty strong! Shuttle Excellent. Never waited more than 10 minutes. There are three different shuttles to Caesars, Ballys and Paris I think. Very good service. The hotels distance from the main strip wasn\u2019t an issue at any time as these shuttles were fantastic and saved us a fortune in taxis. Overall the Rio was a lot better than I expected after reading these reviews. If our view had been of the Strip then I would have loved my stay. It is never going to be comparable to the likes of the Wynn \u2013 it is too old and dated, but the price is very reasonable as the rooms are huge \u2013 with the exception of the bathroom! Having visited MGM & Mandalay Bay & Bellagio etc \u2013 at least the Rio isn\u2019t as busy as these hotels, it would drive me mad having to wade through crowds all the time. Enjoy your trip \u2013 I\u2019m very jealous - and bet hard eight for me! :)", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno", "Title": "\u201cGood Times at the Rio\u201d", "Author": "trip14", "ReviewID": "UR8190486", "Content": "We spent two nights at the Rio Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

Unfortunately it looks like the Rio has abandoned this strategy and treats you like any other strip hotel which is a really dumb thing to do since they are not on the strip. Where should I start: 1) The casino is unbelievably loud. Having to practically yell while checking in/out at the front desk (and having the front desk persons yelling back at you) is not exactly a good first & last impression. There is not necessarily good music blaring from every direction. 2) We initially had a 5th floor room in the Masquerade Tower. The casino was so loud we could hear the thump-thump of the music all night long which kept us awake. We had to switch to a new room on the 31st floor to get away from the noise. 3) The LodgeNet Internet access (which costs $10/day) was on-again, off-again the whole time we were there. My day job is a network engineer and is was NOT my laptop or my network setup. 4) One of the best things the Rio ever did for itself was establish a free shuttle between the Rio and a couple of strip hotels. The drivers now ask to scan your players card if you ride it. Why? One of the drivers said that the Rio is contemplating discontinuing the free shuttle service. DUMB MOVE. Also the shuttle is not 24x7 anymore, it only runs from 10:00am to 1:00am. If you're still on the strip after 1:00am it is time to pay for a cab back to the Rio, I found this one out the hard way. 5) The rooms are big but most of the space in the room is empty with few furnishings. The decor of the rooms and hotel common areas are definitely starting to show their age and are in desperate need of an update. The 3 pools are nice but sometimes 1 or more are roped off. People were going in the closed pools anyway and getting yelled at by the hotel staff. 6) My wife and I gamed for an average of 6 hours a day for 3 days with our players cards at the Rio-affiliated hotels Paris and Bally's. We didn't play at the Rio at all due to the noise and obnoxious minimum bet levels. When it came time to check out and redeem our points we got a whopping $28 off our hotel bill. Gee thanks. Also finding a $10 table for any game is a chore, $15 is the norm and I didn't see a $5 table the whole time I was there.

I booked through the hotel itself about four months ago to capitalize on the conference rate of $142/night. Over the seven nights we stayed the rate ranged from $109-$299/night. I asked for my standard \"non-smoking King bed on a quiet floor.\" When we arrived we were put in a room with two double beds because we were told no King Rooms were available but they would move us the following morning. We essentially \"checked out\" the following morning and were moved to a room on the third floor overlooking the dumpsters which were emptied at 3 AM. My husband who was attending the conference from 7 AM-6 PM asked again for a room on a quieter floor. We were told \"the hotel is full.\" (The shopping center convention was in town with 60,000 people filling up most of the rooms in town). However, they did let us \"check out\" again and after 1 PM assigned us to another room without so much as an apology. The new room was not an upgrade either, it was just 11 floors up. The rooms were not particularly outstanding although they are large (the all-suite hotel), the neon lighting of the outside of the building is downright scary at night. Housekeeping is spotty as they seemed to only vacuum every couple of days despite obvious crumbs (is this to protect the environment somehow?) and they were very stingy with the towels. There were a lot of extra expenses at the Rio including $10 for the first ten minutes of internet use, $22/day for a small crowded fitness room. The valet service, however, was prompt and always asked if we needed directions. And like all of Vegas it was free. (Except for tipping which is expected). The shuttle service to the Strip (rest of civilization) was prompt and reliable and a relief for putzing around town when I didn't want to get the car out. Also, it was free. The seafood buffet was tasty but the Sushi restaurant was subpar and you got a lot of the smoke and noise from the casino area. The \"Masquerade in the Sky\" was downright cheesy. The casino areas were exceptionally smoky day and night. When these areas were full they were quite loud as well.

I was instantly recognized inside as not a heavy gambler, which is the kind of clientel these hotels naturally prefer, and given what I believe was a substandard suite. The room was large, but not a suite at all, just one large room with no seperate bedroom. We had an outstanding view of some mountains 20 miles away and the roof of the casino. I called to inquire about upgrading my room, and was told it would cost another $150 to $250 a night to do so, so we decided to stay put.

After Harrah's took over, the friendly atmosphere has changed to a frenetically loud assault on the senses. There was a noticeable decline in service and a noticeable increase in kitsch. I will not return. The Good: The rooms. For the price, the rooms are hard to beat. They are huge with floor to ceiling windows and at least some have nice views. They are attractively decorated. The TV has always been a little too small for the room, and the sofa is a nice touch but not all that comfortable. Beds are ok but not the luxury models of some high end LV hotels. The coffee maker and refrigerator in the room is convenient although not all rooms are so equipped anymore. Service: Unlike a lot of other hotels, the Rio housekeeping is top notch, as is the bell service and valet if it isn't super busy. Can't say the same for the front desk. I actually think the personnel at the regular check in desk tends to be better than the surly incompetent losers who work at the Platinum check in desk. I have rarely had a good experience with that group. On at least 3 occasions I had to return at least once when a key didn't work for example. I've had desk employees who were unable to check a guest in or out of a room in less than 20 minutes and who either refuse to ask for help or argue with whoever is trying to help them get it right. I've never had one try to accommodate a special room request. No matter when I check in, whether I'm early, whether it is checkin time, after checkin time or late evening, my room is never ready. This wasn't one occasion. This was true on my last three visits. If using a comp or a casino rate, about 50% of the time I have to argue with them to get what was promised on the phone. I used to love the personnel at the Rio. I now find that most people who work there are not customer friendly, from the casino floor, to security to front desk to restaurants and bars. The last time my key wouldn't work, I waited literally 45 minutes for security to show, and then he got off the elevator, said he'd be with me in a minute, went to a courtesy phone and made dinner plans while I stood outside my room with my bags waiting. When he finally got around to assisting me, he opened the door with his master key, announced 'it works' and was going to leave me without checking my key. My key of course didn't work. (after I'd gone down to the desk three different times to have it activated properly) I headed down to the desk for a fourth time. No apology. Just treated as if I was being unreasonable to expect that someone there could activate my key after three tries. Restaurants: The steakhouse has fine food and the service is attentive--almost to the point of annoyance. I haven't found any other restaurant there that is particularly good. Antonios used to be a favorite of mine, but their prices are up and the quality of food and service is down. The Voodoo Cafe is worth trying for the view, but the food is just average. The bartender there the last time I visited was unfriendly to the point of rudeness. Likewise the staff at the wine cellar bar is somewhat chilly. I think the Rio Buffet is highly overrated (always has been). There is a lot to choose from but it isn't very tasty food. The seafood buffet has some great choices but is crowded and noisy at all times. The All-American gives you huge portions of tasteless or overly salted food. The mexican place used to be good, but now is just so so. The cafe has a nice ambience but the food is barely average. It has a great looking cappucino machine that never works. Buzio's is ok, but overpriced and nothing special. The decibel level in the casino has become intolerable. With the constant and frequently unwelcome \"entertainment\"--singing cocktail waiters and waitresses, the parade in the sky, the parade on the floor, the show on the stage, the show on the bar, the show on top of your slot machine, the blasting music, the loud drunks, the annoying penny slots--I thought I would lose my mind after a few hours. You can't even traverse Masquerade Village to your room in the late afternoons and evenings when the once an hour \"parade\" is going on. The table limits are high, and the slots and poker choices tend toward the newfangled rather than the old favorites. My last visit to the spa was not worth the money and a strange odor permeated the place. The staff was unhelpful there. The pool is inviting but is packed wall to wall. Lots of screaming kids. I don't begrudge the kids having fun, but Vegas is an adult playground, not a family destination and I don't want to endure some kid whining in my ear, hitting me with his wet nerf ball or peeing in the pool when I'm on a getaway weekend vacation. I guess the Rio must be making money because the place is always packed, but I doubt they have too many loyal return customers anymore. It seems to largely cater to the bachelor/bachelorette party crowd.

It even had a cool window in the shower that looked out over the strip, that was fun.

I never in my life needed to run a shower for 15 minutes to get hot water and this was a premiun rio suite that goes for 600 plus a night. The casino was never really crowded at the slots but the tables got very crowded. I dont think you can have a bad time at the rio but I prefer a little more upscale hotel. I usually stay at the mgm skylofts or the mirage.

It sounds odd to me that only some of their rooms have high speed internet service (I\u2019m not counting the web TV). Anyway, she told me the only room available was on the third floor. Maybe I misunderstood her, but I thought that still included a view of the pool \u2013 I was wrong. It\u2019s had a view of Palms & Gold Coast Casinos, and the air conditioning/duct system.

There was a funny smell in the room when we first went in, but by the time we left, we didn't notice it anymore. The maids hadn't picked up the last guy's grape stems off the carpet, and they were still there when we left. They also didn't replace our used drinking glasses on the 2nd day. However, the rest was well looked after, the bed comfy. We really enjoyed the masquarade shows at nite, we saw 4 different ones. Ladies..At the end of each masq. show, 2 Chippendale boys come out and you can have your pix taken w/them. Cost was $20.00. Well worth it, just to touch those boys:))) The slots were so tight we gave up playing them. I can't say enough for the Carnival Buffet..it was huge. I'm sure they had every kind of food available. Only complaint was that some of the food was cold by the time we walked from one end of the buffet back to our table at the other end of the room! The hotel has $5.00 off tickets in all the magazines. They also gave us cheap tickets for a couple of shows, which we just didn't have time to see. We really wanted to try dancing at one of their clubs. So Wed. nite after paying $10.00ea, we go up to Voodoo lounge. Of course the guy didn't tell us that 3/4 of it was roped off for a private party. It looked like you went down some stairs where it sounded pretty wild/noisy. Of course it was roped off. Everywhere else, was just people standing around looking bored and drinking. So we left. This was about 11:30pm. Someone told us to come back @1:30am-4am, it would be open and rocking by then. Yeah right, we were sound to sleep by then. Club Rio didn't open til 11pm on Thursday and we'd just walked 6 miles up and down the strip, and gone riding that afternoon. All we saw were 20 year olds heading to the club, so again we didn't even bother. You can print off your boarding pass at the business centre for $1.00 each. Glad we did, cause we found out our flight was delayed. I'd have to say although it was a nice hotel, unless you get it for under $100US a nite, in our opinion South Coast was nicer. the Rio was less than 5minutes to the Strip by car, we didn't get to try the shuttle. -Erocktica at the Rio was an interesting show. We just walked up and got tickets 5min before the show started. There are 2 for 1 tickets available in the hotel magazines, use them. The show was 54.00US before the discount.

I am amazed at some of the negative reviews I've been reading lately, so let me give you the straight dope on the Rio. First of all, some people complained that it was not worth paying $150 bucks a night. Well, no kidding! My stay cost less than half that. If you're paying those rates you either didn't do your homework or you insisted on staying during one of the major weekends when everything in Vegas is overpriced. Second, people have complained about their rooms in the Masquerade Tower. A brief review of this web site before I left was enough for me to know that the Ipanema Tower rooms are much nicer, so that's what we got. Again, do your homework. The rooms at the Rio are big and clean. The furniture and bathroom fixtures, for those who care, were all very nice. The beds were comfy (firm but soft.) Our room was on the third floor and had a terrible view of the roof below, but we didn't care - who spends their time gazing out the window when there is so much to do and see? We did have some difficulties with our in-room safe. Maintenance was not speedy, but when they did come they resolved the issues to our satisfaction. I would describe the service staff as businesslike but friendly. I was underwhelmed by the pools. One was closed, and the others were being sparsely used. The waterfalls were interesting, but standing under them was more like being sprayed with a high pressure hose than a jacuzzi jet. Overall, we thought it was a nice hotel. The off-strip location may be less than ideal for some. We made good use of the free shuttles and didn't have to wait a long time for them to arrive, though they can get stuck in traffic just like a cab. The Rio is within walking distance of Gold Coast and Palms, so it's certainly not isolated. The only place we ate at the Rio was the Carnival World buffet. I can honestly say I think it's the best buffet in Vegas - it has the biggest variety and the best desserts. Definitely go for lunch. I would recommend the Rio for those planning to sleep 3 or more to a room since the rooms are quite spacious.

The relatively early closing time didn't bother us either as once the sun went down, the pool was pretty chilly. We enjoyed several meals at the restaurants (the breakfast buffet is incredible; however, the one across at the street was just as good and much cheaper) and we enjoyed the Mexican restaurant, finding it to be pretty reasonable. Food was good at the All-American grill, but just average menu items and a bit pricey. It was also great to see Penn&Teller at our location. We would certainly come back to the Rio in the future.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cOK - but basically overpriced\u201d", "Author": "jillellen80", "ReviewID": "UR5912710", "Content": "My mom and I stayed at the Rio from Sep 14-18, 2006.

The coffee machine makes only one cup at a time, and until you can ask the maid to leave more, the four styrofoam cups won't help you much.

Our room was never cleaned before 4pm, despite calls to housekeeping and their assurance that the room would be cleaned earlier. And the bartending staff out at the pool got one day's worth of drinks totally confused, trying to charge us double. Cleared up without much effort, but still an indication of the general confusion we found here. The casino play is ok, but the casino feels cramped. In addition, there are sets of slot machines that have a small stage over them and every 10 minutes or so, one of the waitresses gets up and sings or dances. Think cheap cabaret. Really annoying. Food at Buzios was good, but of course, expensive. Food at the pool was a better deal and not half bad. Drinks are the typical lv cost, but they were made pretty good.

Upon arrival, all five rooms were split up, some being 16 floors apart. We were all in non smoking rooms, which the reo gave us ashtrays and allowed smoking in these rooms. We were all also given 1 bed for our families of 4 or more. The hotel was overbooked so some had to spend a night at a different hotel, even though they had made a reservation. Some were also charged higher rates then quoted on the phone. The rooms were nice. Quite large, with very big windows overlooking the strip. However, the pay per view movies did not work. We spent 1 hour on 3 different occasions with maintenance in our room trying to fix for us, but too bad its broken. Let me also tell you we were charged for movies all 3 times we never seen. I was able to get the rio to remove these from our bill but it took a battle. The first night I called the front desk in re: to movies not working they told me they would have someone up in 10-15 minutes. I waited 30 + minutes and called back they said again they would get someone right up. Nobody came, so we went to bed. 1am knock at the door, 2 hours later. We did not answer and then the front desk called the room. I requested that they come back tomarrow to fix because we were in bed. The next day they never showed up, had to call again.

There is a shuttle service that leaves every half hour and takes you to their sister casinos or you can take a cab for under $10. It tends to get pretty crowded - I have never been there and it NOT be crowded except for first thing in the mornng. The one thing that really annoyed me were these few stands that they have up with people approaching you everytime you walked by trying to sell you on show tickets and things like that. It reminded me of telemarketers or the people selling things outside of stores. I haven't been in any other casino that does that. All-in-all, it's a nice place to stay . . . but if you are superstitious be sure they don't put you on the 13th. floor.

The hallways are long so be prepared for a five minute journey down to the lobby. The pool areas, complete with palm trees, will make you think you took the plane to Ochio Rios instead of Las Vegas. Quite nice. The days of the bargain buffet in LV are mostly over. The Rio charges about $14 plus tip for a breakfast buffet. Look for a coupon included with your check-in material for $5 off each member of your family. You can also order a la carte at the restaurant or pick up some pastries and coffee at either of two Starbucks in the hotel.

The servers were friendly and laid out a tablecloth and the set the table for me on both occasions. The food was better than I expected. The casino is large with lots of my favorite penny & nickel slot machines; so it was no trouble to meet the hotel's requirement of 4 hours of play.

They have installed a \"motion control\" device on the thermostat that senses when you are in the room. This device allows you to adjust the thermostat only when it senses motion (only when you are in the room). When it doesn't sense motion for a while (when you leave), it automatically goes intio \"energy saving mode\" which is a preset 80 degrees or so. The result is you always come back to a hot room. The day we stayed at the Rio it was 110 during the day and 97 for the low at night. Our room never cooled down to where we were comfortable. I'm sure this was some accountant's bright idea to pad the bottom line and to heck with the customer. Another issue is security. The only time I saw security checking guests going to the elevators/rooms was at 1:00 AM. We never saw them during the morning/afternoon. Neither was there a security check going into the pool area. The only plus I have was the Concierge. I had a problem printing my boarding pass and they spent about 30 minutes helping me get it straightned out with the airline.

I chose Rio because I read it had a good pool area, and I was not disappointed. Although Mandalay Bay's pool area is incomparable, I thoroughly enjoyed the four pools at Rio for a few reasons. First, the pool area was not crowded--no catty encounters with other guests to get a chair to lay on. Second, at least one of the pools was not heated so I could get a cool blast to relieve the heat of the sun. Third, a good music mix was played that made the environment upbeat--although on one day there was a DJ who played the music too loud for my taste. Fourth, the grill by the pool served pretty good food (pricey and a limited menu, but they served the food in man-sized portions so I didn't feel I was being ripped off). The Rio is smaller than some of the other Las Vegas megaresorts, and this has its plusses and minuses. On the plus side, you won't get lost and you won't feel you have to walk a mile to get to your room. On the other hand, the casino is smaller and there are fewer restaurant and bar choices. The Rio is also a bit older than some of the other resorts and it is noticeable in some places like the elevators. Another thing I noticed is that the Rio has very low ceilings--I am maybe 5'8\" and could reach up and touch the ceilings. My room was in the Ipanema Tower and seemed to have been recently renovated. The room itself was comfortable--they call it a \"suite\" but it is really just an ordinary room that is big enough to fit a couch and a small cocktail table. The decor was unimaginative and generic, mostly purple and gold fabrics and a beige carpet and walls. No flat panel T.V. or giant bath either. But I certainly can't complain about the value I got--my room rate ranged from $59 to $89 a night, which is a great deal considering that I could have paid $100 a night more at another Las Vegas resort without really getting much more for my money. On the down side, I will say that the front desk was unbelievably slow in checking people in, and the housekeeping staff seemed to do a fairly minimal job in tidying up the room. The Rio is also not the place for high society types who might prefer Bellagio or the Wynn--it is suitable for people who are looking for a more down to earth, unpretentious spot--for me it really hit the spot, because all I wanted to do was relax without a lot of fuss.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cRotten Rio\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5235990", "Content": "Rotten Rio - Car valets steal chunks of guests' cars.

The security supervisor then told me there was no tape, gave me a lot of canned answers about how sorry they were, finally took the report (now 3 hours later), then told me I would have to go down to the police station to personally fill out the report. In effect, the Rio did everything they could to scoot me out the door. I filed the report mostly for insurance reasons since I knew that the police clerk would tell me there was not much they could do, which she did.

It's a double decker bus system that goes up and down the strip and into town and, I believe, connections can be made to other areas as well. Distances are great along the strip and that saved us hours of walking! They come along every five minutes or so and are wonderfully air-conditioned. We talked to people who had tried the monorail system and said this was much more convenient. Just catch them at any bus stop. The pool area at the Rio was incredible!!! After our first day of walking, we headed right to the pools and waded in the small sandy pool and it was like a foot massage.

We had 3 rooms and all of them were just fine. My room in particular was a 2 double non-smoking room, good size (it's an all-suite hotel) and very clean. The maid service was just fine. No complaints at all. We ate at the following restaurants: Carnival World Buffet - had breakfast there a couple of times, was very good. Not as good as a couple in town (I think Paris has the best breakfast buffet) but certainly in the top 10. I think it was $13.99 Village Seafood Buffet - went there twice, I loved it. You obviously need to really like seafood to justify the 35-40 bucks this will set you back, but if you do you'll certainly be happy. All American Bar & Grill - went there a few times and was happy with everything I had. It serves lunch and dinner weekdays and breakfasts as well on weekends. I kept it simple, had burgers and quesadilla and was happy everytime. Antonio's - other members of our party went there and liked it. Our background is Italian so if we thought it was good you probably will too. Sports Kitchen - beside the Race and Sport Book. It's bar food and it's good for bar food. Entertainment Tony and Tina's - a few people in our party saw it and thought it was ok. Food was terrible, show was pretty funny. Don't bother paying full price for the tickets (85 bucks) you can get them for about 60 and the half price places on the strip (Tix4tonight - 2-4-1 tickets) - it's not completely half price since the buffet portion on the ticket isn't discounted. Scinta's - was pleasantly surprised. This was one of the better shows I've seen in Vegas and I've seen a couple dozen of them. Nice mixture of comedy and singing. I think you'll like it. Don't bother paying full price as well on this one (half price tickets usually available) but it'll be worth it if u do. Other shows avaiblable: Penn & Teller (funny magic men), Ronn Lucas (daytime comedy), Erocktika (for male pervs), Chippendales (for females pervs.) Casino Casino layout is very good, it's basically 2 different casinos. The Masquerade part where they have the show in the sky is kind of a stand alone. Limits on the table games are a minimum of $10 and sometimes $15. The race and sports book is a good size and not real busy unless it's a big event. The day we left was a zoo since March Madness had begun. Poker Room is beside the sportsbook. There's a daily tournament ($40 buy-in) at noon, and games basically going all day (4-8 limit, and 2-5 no limit). The one drawback with this hotel in the past was that you were a cab ride to the strip - they've fixed that. They have 3 seperate shuttles going to Bally's, Harrah's and Caesars. Takes about 25 minutes to make the route there and back. If you're just looking for a ride to the strip you won't be waiting more than a few minutes. On the way back you may have to wait longer since you'll be waiting for one specific bus as opposed to jumping on the first one that shows up. Don't know what other people were complaining about in previous posts but let me defend the Rio (no I don't work for the company). 1) It's too loud in the casino - it's a freakin casino people - they tend to be loud. 2) food is expensive - Not really. The Bar and Grill is comparable to most Vegas cafe type places - bacon cheese burger with fries was $11 I think. The buffet was 13.99 for breakfast, like 23 or so for dinner. If you can't afford 20-25 bucks for dinner, you may want to stay out of Vegas. 3) it's a long walk to the strip - Don't walk to the strip.

We went there to attend a meeting, and would probably stay there again if another meeting is located there, but otherwise would bypass this place altogether. The check in was okay. The clerk was pleasant. Although we had requested a king size non-smoking room when we made reservations months earlier, none was available when we checked in unless it was at the low tower. Since the other people we knew were at the high tower we took the double queen suite they offered at check in. Although the bathroom of the king size bed room our friends were in was very generous, the two queen size suite we were in had a bathroom the size you get when staying at a Motel 8. You had to back away from the bathroom door by the toilet to get out. The bathroom door is also very thin, and certainly not sound proof. Cleanliness left a lot to be desired, not only in our room but also in the rooms occupied by friends. It was okay for a two star hotel, but we had expected more from what we thought would be luxury accomodations. Even the cheap little tray for the soap was stained. There were also marks on the wall under the towel rack which could have been removed with some 409 and a little elbow grease. The tub and shower had mold growing in the corners, something we control at home, and don't expect in an expensive hotel. There was no soap or soap dish in the bathroom, only at the basin outside the bath. No shower cap, mouthwash, conditioner or other amenity was offered. Although we were in a non-smoking room we could periodically smell cigarette smoke in the room. I don't know if the entire floor is non-smoking or only individual rooms. The lobby and casino are extremely noisy. You have to search for someplace quiet enough to eat if you are planning to have a conversation. The food is pretty good even though expensive. Although there is a small refrigerator in the room, there is no coffee maker or complimentary coffee in the rooms. My wife always likes the coffee upon awakening, and in order to have it, she had to wait until showered and dressed. Although an internet connection is available, it is not complimentary. If you want to pick up your e-mail at their business center, it is 10 dollars for 10 minutes. To go to their workout center, even as a guest it is an additional 20 dollars. Although the brouchures and internet pictures suggest that there is lavish entertainment in the casino, it is hardly that. It is extremely loud though. The meeting facility or convention center is good. The sound system and projection facilities were good. Unfortunately, to get from the hotel tower to where the meetings are held it is about three or four blocks. If you are attending a meeting there, plan enough time for a long walk. On the map, it seems that the Rio is located close to the strip. It isn't. It is a long walk. If you take the free shuttle from the Rio to Harrahs, figure that it will take a half hour. They run the shuttle every 15 minutes, but the shuttle buses are small and can't take all the crowd. It takes about the same time to walk the distance. All in all, we were in Las Vegas for three and a half days. The Rio doesn't compare with the nicer places on the strip. It is awkward to get to, offers little, and the facility comes off as a tired old place. With the exception of their convention facility it is no more than a three star place and off the beaten path. We paid big bucks to stay there because our meeting was there, but wouldn't recommend it at more than seventy or eighty dollars.

Should have waited and bought them at Tix2nite, they would have been half price. Being in the music industry ourselves, we were looking forward to having someone else entertain us for a change. We chose one show for our 3 day trip, Erocktica! A perfect blend of rock music, bare chested hotties, and sexy dancing. We weren't disapointed. When we arrived at the Rio Hotel, we went first to the VooDoo Lounge and weren't impressed at all, (see review on VooDoo Lounge by searching for VooDoo Lounge) that all changed once we set foot in the Erocktica show. A quick glance around we saw a couple hundred people all cramped together in little seats. Looked like a school assembly with everyone on banquet chairs. Ugh, not for us. There was a roped off area with nice booths that weren't being used. We asked the usher/security guy what that seating was for. He replied that it was reserved seating. Okaaaay, it was obvious that this situation called for a bit more finesse. A quick discreet tip to the \"GUY\" got the rope removed and a nice booth for us to enjoy the show. Things just seem to work like that in Vegas. The show was amazing, the music pumping and the girls beautiful. Gabriella, Sasha and RJ were clearly the stars, incredible vocals and big ups to RJ for his rockin Hip Hop MC style. There were quite a few moments during the show where he had to carry the show while the girls changed outfits. He did so with relative ease. The tunes took us all back and made us smile. Loved the pussycat doll segment. We definatly recommend this show. Gabriella and RJ come out after the show to meet their fans, a nice touch. We would see it again.

The hotel offers two alternatives, a shuttle to Harrah's (wasn't available when I wanted to leave so I didn't use it) or you could walk into the strip. Walking, however, means about one mile on foot through busy traffic, on the overpass of a major interstate, which is a deal killer for most.

Was there on business but stayed one night on my own and got it for a very reasonable 109.00/night. I had a beatiful room on the 18th floor which over looked the pool. The room was quite large, with plenty of sitting space and sleeping space. The floor to ceiling windows really added to the ambiance of the room. The bathroom is not as nice as some of the other places in las Vegas, but the little window in the shower so that you can see outside is really cool. there are 2 sinks, one inside the bathroom and one outside the bathroom in the 'changing area', which makes it nice if 2 people need to get ready at the same time. I ordered desert from room service one night that was delivered in a timely matter and had a very nice presentation. The place is large and lots to do with in the hotel and casino. The only thing that i did that i would do different next time, was dinner in the seafood buffet. I wasnt aware at the time that there are two different buffets in the casino, and went to the first (only, I thought) buffet. It was very good, but was like 38.00. (per person) I found out later that the other one was only like 24.00. granted, the first one had lobster, shrimp, crawfish adn everything imaginable. I dont know to what extend the dinner buffet at the other one was, but I did eat breakfast there (it was free with the room, be sure to ask about this option when checking in), and it was VERY bountiful! I dont gamble a lot, just nickel and penny slots, but did not win a SINGLE time (never was even ahead), and since I have never had this happen before (where I never even got ahead), I dont know if it was just bad luck or if the slots are very tight. There is a shuttle to the strip (takes you to Harrah's) that some reviews stated was a hassle. I did not find that to be true. Yes, there is a little bit of a walk from pick up and drop off, but where ISNT there in vegas? I found it to be very easy, efficient and safe. I was alone when I did this and didnt have any problems, even at night. The only 'problems' I encountered during the stay was, number one, it seemed like every time I left my room and came back, my key card didnt work. This happened AT LEAST 5 different times. although this was inconvient, it was handled quickly by calling security and having them let me in, instead of having to walk all the way back to the lobby each time (a long walk). Then the next time I was down there, I had a new key made. The ohter problem (or disappointment i guess) was the 'carnival in the sky' was closed the entire time I was there so they could decorate and get ready for the Christmas rendition.

The DOWNFALL to a corner room is the location of the bed, there is an echo from the hallway due to the layout of the doorway - so be prepared for the echo but the view when the sun comes up is well worth it.

Everything was clean, but there were minor stains on a couch but again, every stain doesn't always come out when you clean it. The Seafood buffet was OK - not my favorite - and the Carnival Buffet was still good. They even have a seperate dining area for Platnium members which was very nice. I would highly recommend getting the players card since they are very loose on COMPS and offer some nice touches for the members.

Although the room was spacious and clean it smelled like drywall and saw dust probably due to the extensive remodeling going on on the same floor.

Through the Harrah's Total Rewards program, my husband and I were offered the first night for free, $65 for the second night, and $50 for the third. I was *hoping* that the discounted suites wouldn't be as horrible as some of the reviews indicated. I held my breath and hoped that our $115 accommodations were going to be decent! After taking a short taxi ride from the airport we arrived at the Rio around 9:30pm on a Friday night. We were expecting check-in to be a little hectic, but we were processed very quickly, and were given a \"renovated\" suite at our request. Our suite was located on the 16th floor of the Ipanema Tower (which is the older of the 2 towers, but seems to have more recently renovated rooms). The Ipanema Tower was very easy to access from the main lobby and taxis, and the elevators were conveniently located right next to Starbucks. If we had decided to stay in the Masquerade Tower, we would have had to trek across the length of the casino, and through the Masquerade Village, just to get to the elevators! When we arrived to our suite, we were very surprised at the size and cleanliness of the room. The decor wasn't fancy by any means, but everything looked new and neat. The room came equipped with a King size bed, a desk, a sofabed, a minibar, a refrigerator, a huge bathroom with 2 sinks, and a dressing area. We had a mountain view location, which looked out onto the Palms Casino. It wasn't the most scenic view, but with the 110 Vegas heat, you don't want to open the curtains very often anyhow! We couldn't believe how quiet the room was, even in the wee hours of the morning, when we knew folks were returning from a late evening out. The Rio casino itself seemed very outdated and a bit cheesy, but that didn't seem to stop the crowds from rolling in. We played a bit of Roulette and Pai Gow Poker, and didn't have much luck. The slot machines looked a bit worn, and I couldn't find any of my favorite games. Since Harrah's owns the Rio, there was a continuous shuttle service that ran between the two hotels, which was a free and easy way to get to the strip if you didn't want to have to take a cab. The Rio pools (all 4 of them) were very nice, and had a good vibe. We headed out at 11am two days in a row, and were able to find some nice chaise lounges in the shade without too much trouble. The pool was comprised of a mix of families and young partygoers, and everyone got along very nicely. The pool area offers 2 bars, and a walk-up stand that serves sandwiches and burgers. Be prepared to spend a bit of cash if you plan on having lunch or snacks while poolside. Out of the 10 eateries that the Rio features, we only sampled the food at the All-American Bar and Grill. The Grill features aged meats, International spirits and a nice selection of appetizers and burgers. We found the food to be very tasty, and quite reasonable compared to most of the meals we ate while in Vegas. A hearty-sized lunch cost about $20 for the both of us. If you're looking for some nightlife, the Voodoo Lounge atop the 51st floor of the Masquerade Tower is an excellent place to start. With views of the entire strip, and a DJ spinning on Friday and Saturday nights, the Lounge draws in a 20/30-something crowd. The cover charge is $20 per person, but you may be able to find some discount vouchers if you check in with the local cabbie. We had a great time overlooking the city, and enjoyed the fresh air of the outdoor deck. We even met Jared (of Subway Sandwiches fame) in the elevator on the way up! I took a picture of him on my cameraphone, and have included it for your viewing pleasure. As our stay was coming to an end, we were actually sad to leave the Rio! The suite and the pools were really enough to convince us that this was a destination that we would make an effort to visit again.

The Rio is a solid performer. We arrived on a Friday afternoon and left on Monday morning. We stayed on the 9th floor of the Impanena (sp?) tower. There was construction on one of the hallways but it did not cause us any problems. They had nicely placed a curtain to cover the mess. The room was very large and modern. It was decorated in modern browns, cafe au lait and cream colors. The bed was comfortable, but not luxury (no down comforters, no excessive pillows, no fabulous bedding). The bathroom was acceptable and had a sink/vanity. Outside the bathroom was a long counter/vanity with another sink. The closet/storage was adequate. There is a large (36\") television, and a foldout full size couch, a comfortable chair, a small table with 2 table chairs. The windows take up an enitre wall and are floor to ceiling. We faced the back of the hotel away from the strip, but did have a nice view of the mountains. There is a minibar, which is well stocked. The casino is ok. It is not classy and glamorous like the Bellagio or the Wynn but it is nice. The weird Mardi Gras boats that go around on the tracks on the ceiling seemed to be inop. Personally, I thought this was better. There is a large mask hanging from the ceiling with television screen eyes. One of the eyes was not working and I thought this looked rather cheap. The nightlife is also ok. We only went to the VooDoo Lounge one night. The cover charge at $20 was WAY WAY WAY too much. It is a pretty nice bar/club with an outside area with an AMAZING view of the Strip. (The club is on the 50th floor). They had a live band, which did a decent job playing a variety of hits. There are girls dancing in \"cages\" and a nice sized crowd built up. The drinks were astronomically priced, but I do recommend the drink in the large glass that they drop dry ice in to make it smoke. It was very tasty! The restaurants are ok as well. Both buffets are ok. The seafood buffet is pretty good but entirely overpriced for what you get, and if you don't like seafood then you are not going to find much to eat. The American Bar and Grille is pretty good, but do not order any chicken dish (besides wings) as they were very very dry. There is no good shopping to speak of. Just tacky tourist shops. The pool area is very nice. We went down everyday at about 11am and had no problem at all finding lounge chairs wherever we wanted to sit. There are four pools and none of them were too crowded. We were waited on very well. The drinks are very very pricy. The frozen drinks were good though and perfect for outside. The hot tubs were not very hot either in location or temperature. There are some fancy looking tent things which were mostly empty. I don't know how you get access to these tents nor how much they cost. We went and saw Penn and Teller. This show is very funny, and we got really great seats (fourth row, center). The staff booking the show was very helpful. All in all, I had a nice time at the Rio. Its location is off the strip slightly, but really that was ok with me. The staff was nice to me at every location. The rooms are great. The pool is great. The casino is like any other casino. The nightlife was good, but entirely overpriced. The shopping is non-existant.

The carpeting was the dirtiest I have ever seen in a hotel. The windows were also really dirty. One of the bath towels reeked of men's aftershave - so it must have been reused without washing (neither my 15 year old granddaughter or I use aftershave). Water gurgled up in the sink drain in the vanity area every time water was run in the bathroom sink. Even though the pool area is very nice, it closes at 7PM. There were no signs anywhere to let guests know this. My granddaughter had just gotten into the pool at 6:45 PM and then was told at 7:00PM that everyone had to leave. This was August, it was 99 degrees. I arrived at the gym, ready to excersise, only to be informed that there was a $20 per day per person charge to use the gym equipment, again, no information provided to guests about this fee ahead of time.

The temperature during the day was hot (100-106 degrees F.), however it was without the humidity that we are used to at home. So, we actually found it to be more tolerable than the hot and humid summer days that we are used to. Because we were using a free voucher for our hotel we had to check in to Harrah\u2019s, which owns the Rio. So, from the airport we took a shuttle bus to Harrah\u2019s. The shuttles are $5 to hotels on the strip, a little more to hotels downtown. Or, you can take care of your return trip to the airport by buying a round-trip shuttle bus ticket for $7. The shuttles tend to wait until they are full with riders before they will depart the airport. So, when picking a shuttle to board, it might be best to find one that is close to capacity, decreasing the time that you might be waiting. After checking in at Harrah\u2019s we made our way over to the Rio. Check-in there went extremely smooth and did not take much time at all. In order to get to our room in the Masquerade Tower, we had to walk through the casino and through the very busy Masquerade Village. However, once on the elevators, the noise along with the hustle and bustle of the casino was completely gone. We were rather pleased with our room. Our room was extremely large, with a spacious bathroom and changing area with vanity. There was a sitting area with an L-shaped couch and television. There was also a small table for two, a small refrigerator, and a giant king sized bed. The windows took up pretty much the entire wall and were from floor to ceiling. We had a beautiful view of the mountains and the pool by day. During the night we could see the beautiful lights of the strip, from the Mirage, up to the Stratosphere and beyond. There are rooms available that have better views of the Strip, however we enjoyed having both the mountain and Strip view. Although, the room could have definitely used some updating, we still found it to be comfortable and clean. I was not overly impressed by the Masquerade in the Sky show. I found it more of an annoyance trying to make my way through the crowd gathered to watch, while I tried to get to and from my room. I could see how the show could be entertaining if you or someone you knew were in the show. Beyond that I felt that it was a bit \u2018hyped\u2019 in advertisements as one of the best free things to do in Vegas. As for the rest of the hotel, we found the Carnival Buffet to be satisfactory considering we had received free vouchers for attending a timeshare talk at Harrah\u2019s. It was absolutely the biggest buffet that I\u2019ve ever seen. The selection of different types of food was amazing. The food quality was high for \u2018buffet standards\u2019, which in my book buffets are not highly marked when it comes to quality. I\u2019m not big on buffet food but this did seem to be overall a good one. Although we ate for free with our vouchers, we still found the normal price of about $22/person, would have been reasonable. I felt that the atmosphere in the Rio Casino was a bit more on the sleazy side. Compared to casinos like the one\u2019s at the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, etc\u2026the Rio did not seem to make any attempt at having any class. I was kind of taken aback by the barely clad women that were often seen in the casino, dancing erotically or just \u2018advertising\u2019 the various clubs. I thought that they would be more in the areas of the clubs themselves and could possibly be avoided but they were spread all throughout the main level. A reminder to me that Vegas is not exactly the family friendly place that it has been trying to portray itself as. Or, at least the Rio is definitely not a place that I would want to take my own children. I wouldn\u2019t appreciate having to walk my children by a woman doing a strip tease, just to get to our room. The pool area at the Rio was definitely a plus. There were four pool areas that you could chose from. One was a sand bottom pool with a beach and palm tree area. There were also hot tubs and waterfalls found around one of the other pools. They had cabanas that could be rented or plenty of regular lounge chairs that could be used. We found it to be very relaxing. We also ordered food from the poolside grill and found it to be very good, although, a bit pricey. Using the free shuttle that runs between Harrah\u2019s and the Rio, we were able to get to and from the Strip easily. The pick-up times for the shuttle are approximately every 15 minutes. Although, note that the hours for the shuttle are 10am-1am, Mon.-Wed. and 10am-4am, Thurs.-Sun. We noticed that during the evening hours when people would be heading out for dinner, the shuttle lines could get long. So, you may want to take these things into consideration when wanting to use it for your mode of transportation. Overall, our stay at the Rio was very satisfactory. Definitely not one of the classier joints in Vegas and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for families with children, because of the seediness seen throughout the establishment. It definitely is showing some wear however it seems as though they are trying to update in various places. These things along with it being an off-Strip hotel are probably some of the reasons why you can find such great deals when reserving there. So, if none of the \u2018negative\u2019 aspects that I mentioned are a problem for you, I\u2019d say definitely go for the great bargain that can be found in staying at the Rio.", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNeed to work a little harder\u201d", "Author": "churchmouse", "ReviewID": "UR3742917", "Content": "Let's start with the positive.

Yes it isn't a true suite with separate rooms but it is an enormous size room and we had a great view of both the pool and the strip. We love the large tv, the sitting area, the free safe (large enough to put your laptop in) and the fridge. The only problems we had in our room was the air conditioner didn't seem to be cooling the room enough. They sent someone up to take a look at it and he changed the furnace filter and the room cooled off dramatically (there was a large amount of dust on it). Also about 3am our smoke detector started beeping due to a low battery. They came up in less than 5 minutes to replace the battery and were very apologetic for the disturbance. The food at the Rio buffet is great, but a little pricey compared to some of the other local buffets. The buffet over at the Palms was pretty good and the price was a lot cheaper. Parking is a bit difficult if you have a car. It is always a long walk to your room. Our suggestion is to use Valet parking on arrival and again on departure so you won't have to drag your luggage as far thru the casino. We used the shuttle to Harrah's once so we could visit Toby Keith's new restaurant there(good food but a little overpriced). It saved us a lot of parking hassles. Just be sure you check what time the last shuttle leaves Harrah's to come back to the Rio. Gambling was the same as last time. High minimum bets! Try the Gold Coast next door for better minimums. The pool was great as usual. There are 4 pools and several hot tubs. At least one of the pools was heated, which even in 105 degree weather was great. The drinks around the pool were pricier than we were willing to pay. A 32 ounce drink was $16. Maybe I am cheap but I just couldn't see paying that much when I can get free drinks while gambling. We just brought drinks from our room instead. Speaking of the drinks in the casino. The margarita's we had there were awesome! They do have some great bartenders there.

Upon check in we were told we had to wait for them to clean a room which was fine with us because that usually is the case but after about a half an hour of waiting, they sent us up to a DIRTY room - the bed was not made and there were alcohol bottles everywhere. Clearly, housekeeping had not been there yet. When I called the front desk to tell them that, they informed me that it would be at least another hour to clean a room so instead they sent someone up right away. They also offered us a dining credit, i dont remember for how much but I will talk about the buffet later! The room - the rooms are excellent! It is very large with a large couch as well.

The windows are floor to ceiling so ask for a room that faces the strip - the hotel is off the strip but there is an awesome view at night! Bathroom is nice and our room also had a vanity area, closet, and mini fridge (loved it!) The decor is not modern or luxorious but again, the room is huge! The casino and lobby are nothing to awe at, but its decent. The pool is really nice. It has a sand beach with waterfalls and plenty of pool benches. There are cocktail waitresses going around in bikinis and a pool bar. I ordered a pina colada from the bar and when I got it, it tasted really fowl. So i went back up and told the bartender and he said \"ya I think the milk is bad, people keep telling me that\" He did replace my drink with something else, but it worries me that a bartender would keep serving a drink if he thought the milk in it had gone bad. Anyways, you will love the pool.. Its great for families with children too because there are lots of shallow areas. The Rio World Carnival buffet is hands down the best buffet in Vegas! Anyone who has eaten there will probably tell you that. The selection is the best - it has different buffet stations all the way around the eating area and every one of them represents a different kind of food. So whatever you like - japanese, mexican, italian, american, etc. It's all there! Try the mongolian station and a little bit of everything from the desert bar :) It is not expensive at all and for all the variety it has, the quality is still top notch! Definitely my favorite part about the hotel. My trip went sour the next morning, when I turned over my pillow and there was blood on the pillow. It was not mine because Im sure I didnt have a bloody nose or anything like that. My boyfriend took the pillow down to the front desk to show them and instead of being apologetic, they insisted that we had to have done that because they would not have overlooked that in cleaning the room. Obviously this aggravated us and everyone from the manager down was really snobby and rude about it. They blew us off and just wanted us to leave. We are not big complainers, we are young and usually not very picky. But we do travel a lot and expect certain standards and courtesys to be upheld. I ended up writing them a letter expressing my concerns and all the little unfortunate things that happened while we were there.

The room was very old and worn looking. The bathroom had peeling paint on the walls and the tub looked like it had been there for 20 years. It had gray stains on it that I could not figure out. Because the beds looked clean, we decided to not make a fuss because we were there with many family members. About two hours after checking in, we returned to the room. The pathway to the non-smoking room was full of cigarette smoke and the air conditioner in the hall was making loud noises. I thought that it would get better once I was inside the room. Upon entering our room, I smelled something burning. Maintenance came and changed the filter to the air conditioner and told me it was just coming in from the halls. After getting ready for the night, I found the smell was worse not better. I called maintenance again. I asked them to check my smoke detector. The maintenance person told me that it was working because he saw a red spot where the light should be. I insisted that he check the smoke detector. When it did not work, he called to get a new one. He then found out that it had been removed from the wall and was not connected to the system at all. All along the smell was getting worse and the maintenance man was noticing it too. I asked what made him think that the smell was going to go away. After all, he noticed it getting worse. I was concerned about my safety and a possible fire. They finally moved us to an upgraded room on the 14th floor which had a coffee maker and a refrigerator. We could not sit on the couch because we were not sure if the stain on the couch was blood or just lipstick. The rug was worn and frayed. The room was at least free of a burning odor. The upgraded room was not very clean and I wondered what people have come to expect from this hotel. When I have been to suites, they have been so much nicer at such places as Candlewood. The shower was slow and the toilet was hard to flush. The bathroom wall still had hair on it from the prior person. I wondered if this is the quality of the hotel. The front desk was not very happy with me. I mentioned to my brother, a Diamond member, about it and he just shrugged. When visiting my sister's room in the Masquerade area, I was surprised to find that her room was not very clean either. Not sure if they are slipping or if they just do not care.

We had stayed at the Rio during our last trip tp Vegas, about four years ago. We have also stayed at 6 or 7 other properties in Las Vegas in the last 10 years or so. The Rio is a great place for some but certainly not for everyone. The same is true for all properties as is evident in the wide variety of reviews and ratingd for all hotels. Our rooms were standard suites and there is a lot to be said for a room that is over 600 square feet. We thought the rooms and the entire property overall were in very good condition although the suites we were in had not been renovated yet. Although I had read some negative reviews regarding cleanliness, we found housekeeping to be very good and very accomodating. Overall level of service in the hotel was OK, not great and not terrible. The buffet was good but not what it had been some years ago prior to Harrah's taking over the property. The Seafood Buffet was a disappointment as the quality has gone down since the last time we were there while the price has gone up to almost $35 per person! The mexican restaurant (Bamboleos) was as good, if not better, than almost all of the reviews suggested. Not only was the food excellent but the prices were an incredible value! We chose the Rio because of our 5 yaer old loving the pools at the hotel and we were completely comped during our stay. The hotel is a great choice for people in their 20s and 30s and the crowd at the Rio tends to be a bit younger. The Voodoo lounge is a great club and the casino is filled with entertainment, music and noise! If you are older and are interested in a quieter more upscale experience then this is definitely not the hotel for you. A better choice would be Ceasars, the Bellagio, the Venetian, the new Wynn, Mandalay Bay, etc. All in all the value of the Rio is very good with suites midweek going for $89 per night. Weekend nights are pricey at about $300 to $350 per night and for that price I would definitely choose a different hotel.

With lots of great clubs at the Rio, cabs are always dropping people off, so your ability to grab a cab doesn't take too long. Unless you're really ambitious, I suggest taking a cab to most any hotel on the strip, so bring a little extra $$ to take care of this minor issue. The Seafood buffet is pricy ($35 each), but it was all very fresh and quite outstanding. It's worth a look once...

Good for budget conscious. We tried the breakfast buffet first day, no queue, just as good as I remember. Thought we would try a different buffet next day, Mirage. A bit dearer, only difference is you can get Italian, Chinese, Mexican food as well. Also waitered service. Personally prefer to serve myself. Next day tried Rio across the road. Oh my God, what have we done. We are campers and are used to living it rough, but this was the pits. Badly displayed buffet, poor selection, poor dark and dismal surroundings, food tasted yuk, couldn't wait to get out AND it was a dollar more than circus circus. It made us feel like circus circus was the Ritz. If like us all you want is a large good choice of breakfast items that look good,taste good, nice surroundings, good price, I recommend circus circus. We are not gamblers so can't recommend any. We go to look around. A good tip, a $5 day bus ticket takes you anywhere in Las Vegas for 24hrs. Get a bus time-table from the depot or sometimes on their buses. Even if you stay on the strip you can go one stop or from MGM to Downtown as many times as you want. Good for saving the old legs. It is worth it as I think just one trip costs $2. You can get to the Beltz Factory Outlet South Vegas using your $5 day ticket by a strip bus to the depot and then transfer It really is great for getting around. Depending on how much time you have, we like adventure so we looked at the bus map and went to different locations outside the strip - very interesting. We saved \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's on bus travel. When we arrived there are booths just outside the airport doors selling tickets to take you to your hotel. I think it cost $8 RETURN each. The price is printed on the plastic windows. The person in the booth gave us a disc. It had a phone number to ring the day before we were leaving to arrange pick up time at our hotel. When you phone they ask what time you need to be at the airport (remember checking in time) and they will give you a pick up time. We got into a people carrier, about 8. America seems to give discount for their elderly (called seniors) after the age of 55, so ask if you have to pay for anything.

We visited the Rio for a party that was held at the VoodDoo lounge. As far as I could tell the Rio itself was nice. The floor show was crazy and fairly extravegant being it was free. Immpressive. The VooDoo lounge was more relaxed than the other bars with an amazing view and would definetly go back to that place again - but don't fall for the band screaming about \"go back to the bar for free shots!\". Turns out you'll only get that \"free shot\" if you throw at least five bucks at the bartenders. On top of that the \"free shots\" were some kind of punch with absolutly NO \"punch\". However, my major beef here is with the horrible demeanor of the staff at the Mexican restaurant on the second floor next to the entrance to the Voodoo lounge. We sat at the bar and asked for a plain Margarita. The waiter/bartender behind the bar didn't even look up...was busy writing/reading something...no idea, but under his breath said \"we're all out\". We sat there for a second and thought he was kidding as he didn't offer up any alternatives or even seemed to give a crap. As we sat there in silence and confusion, we asked the top of his head if he was kidding. Still staring at the ground of whatever, he replied \"no\". I confirmed and said \"so...are you out of everything or.....?\" as I continued to stare at his scalp, it mumbled \"yeah, won't get anymore in till tomorrow.\" So we sat there wondering if this guy was either trying to get rid of us, hated us, hated his job...no idea...all the while noting other waiters and bartenders making and retrieving other cocktails, daquri's and such. Since we were starving and were'nt familiar with the rest of the hotel, we reluctantly ordered a beer from now the the back of his head, wondering if he even heard us until they came...but we really wanted to leave after that. Food was good and came out quickly, but that server was the biggest jerk I've ever had the displeaure of meeting at a restaurant. Just when we thought we were getting past the service, a female bartender and some other male bartender start screaming at eachother behind the bar \"get out of my face!\" and \" you're driving me crazy!\". The other replied with \"I'll quit right now, I'm serious! I'll walk\" and other things about \"being sick of this\" bla bla bla. All the staff there just seemed really pissed off and it wasn't even that busy. Salsa was runny and weak...was more like tomato juice. The decor of the place was nice but ONE BATHROOM STALL FOR THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM! It's a big place too. About 5-6 girls were waiting for the toilet so I was forced to use the men's bathroom. I said \"sorry man\" as I passed some guy at the urinal as I headed for the stall. I would NOT come back to this restaurant here EVER AGAIN. Since crap rolls downhill I'm assuming they either don't pay staff well or are treated badly for everyone to act so outwardly unhappy to customers.

Got my wish in September, 2004, when we stayed two of our six nights at the Rio. There were no problems with check-in, or the room itself. In fact, the room was large, nicely appointed, and had a great view. The bathroom was equally nice, and we found it all to be quite clean. We spent a lot of time down by the pool, (bar), and our first experience there almost had us running for the door. We walked into the pool bar area, which was empty but for a couple of ladies sitting and talking with one of the two bartenders. We sat down next to these ladies, (and the bartender was a few feet away from us) and waited to be served. We waited, and waited, and waited. The bartender who was talking with the ladies was more interested in the conversation than in serving us. In fact, Several people who came in after us were promptly served, (by the other bartender) and at one point I asked my husband if we were invisible. Normally, I do not become annoyed with issues regarding service....cause, hey, you're on vacation, right? But after we sat there for 10-12 minutes, and no one waited on us, I was forced to ask the bartender if there was a reason we were not being served. He apologized, said he didn't \"see us\", and we had no further problems. In spite of this first impression, the whole pool area is a great place to relax and the surroundings are quite beautiful. In the past, I have enjoyed the casino atmosphere at the Rio, the Masquerade in the Sky, and the general ambience. However, after staying there a couple of days, I did find the show to be distracting, especially while playing video poker. It was hard to concentrate on VP with all the music, noise, and people justling for beads! (Great people watching, though) So, if you are into serious gambling, I would recommend the gaming areas away from the Masquerde Village. We found the Titlted Kilt Pub to have great food and service; and it is a great place to sit and watch the shows. My husband particularly enjoyed having a Guiness on tap there. We tried the Mexican restaurant here (sorry, can't remember the name), although it was so dead the evening we stopped by, that when we first walked by, we thought it was closed. The food was good and the margaritas hit the spot. All in all, we really enjoyed the Rio. If the price is right, we would consider staying here again. In researching hotels for our next visit in May, I am finding that Rio's pricing is more in line with Ceasars or Mandalay Bay. If I am going to spend that kind of money for a room, then I would choose Mandalay over the Rio.

We were there 3 nights, and stayed at a different hotel each night. Our last night was at the Rio. It was by far the worst hotel with the worst service we have ever encountered in Las Vegas. First of all, we got there at 6pm at night, and all 4 floors of their parking garage were full. We had to park in an area where semi truicks park, and walk about 1/2 mile in the cold. When we got inside to check in for our $130 a night room with a king size bed and a strip view, we found out instead that we got 2 queens with a view of Outback Steakhouse. When I called the front desk to discuss the situation, I was told that the strip view rooms were reserved for the VIPs for the holiday and that none were available. I guess the first time guests just get the lousy 4th floor street view. Since I had paid $30 more for a strip view, I wanted something to be done. The clerk put me on hold, and apparantly hung up on me. After 5 minutes of silence, and realizing I was not actually on hold, I called back. I was then told that I could ether be put into a strip view room since I was only staying one night (gee, why didn't they just give me that room to begin with?), or get the credit. I decided to take the credit. Since I had already paid for the room I asked how I would be credited. I was told the credit would go back on my debit card when I checked out. Low and behold, I checked out on the 30th, and today is the 2nd, and no credit has yet to be applied to my debit card. Yet the $50 buffet charge is definately there. I also found out that since I had paid for the room with a debit card, there seems to be some type of difference with that versus a credit card. I'm not sure what it is, but the check in person asked if we were planning on charging anything to our room. We said \"probably not\", not realizing that we would not even have the chance to do it. When we got in the room, we found a mini bar that was locked and unaccessable due to the lack of having a credit card hold on the room. That should have been explained to us when checking in, since I could have given him an actual credit card, versus the debit card I had paid with. As far as the room was concerned, it was very spacious. However, there were hairs on the toilet seat and in the shower, which just added to my disgust of the whole situation. We ate dinner at the Rio buffet which has been completely remodeled. The food was excellent. Now, whether it was worth waiting in line over an hour and $65 (including the automatic tip) for two people, that I'm still not sure of. But we did go back for breakfast the next morning and there was no line at all, so that made up for the painfull wait the night before. I had never realized before how smokey the casino was. When I got back to the room I noticed that what I was wearing completely smelled like smoke. That has never happened at any of the other hotels I have stayed at, such as Hard Rock, MGM Grand, Bellagio and The Mirage. My last bad experience here was when I tried to check out via the tv. The system was down, and I could not check out that way. I left a message on the automated phone check out service, but did not feel very comfortable with that at all. I'm very sad that my stay at the Rio was such a bad experience, because other visits to the Casino and buffet have always been great. In fact, my husband and I rode on one of the floates in the past, and also got engaged there on one of our visists over 4 years ago. Unfortunately, we will NOT be going back to stay at the Rio, but MAY possibly continue to visit the Casino. As far as spending the night, we will be sticking to the Mirage, where we go every summer, where the service and atmosphere are great!

From our bed it was like flying-- at night seeing the whole strip and all the lights-- and in the mornings seeing the sun rise in over the mountains in the desert. I guess for that it was worth it. It kinda sucked being off the strip, but we were close enough to drive there, or take the 24 hr. shuttle to Harrah's.

Rooms are not Suites, but probably the largest rooms in Vegas, for the least money. 36 inch TV's nice King Bed, leather padded Headboard, in room Safe, large vanity area, in room refriderator, which is handy if you want to some food from room service to eat later, very nice large and compfy L Shaped sofa. Room was very clean, and housekeeping very good. Casino was realtively quite, ceiling low, and a bit smoky for my liking. Breakfast in restaurant done the hall from the main showroom, where Penn + Teller perform, was very nice food terrific and fast, but expensive. Free Shuttle service to Harrah's very efficient, came every 5 minutes, and a great service!Went to Bellagio, this is the place to play blackjack you can get $5 or $10 tables, without too much trouble, dealers really nice and friendly, Hotel is the nicest in Vegas, as far as the Casino and Public areas Xmas decorations concerned, they just opened their new tower, the day we were there the TV crews were all over filming. Ceasars nice, but way too long to walk everywhere, got last minute tickets front row, dead center stage at MGM for David Copperfield, he was standing 6 inches from us for most of the show and shook hands with us at the end of the show, he had his parents in the theatre, nice looking older couple, it was his very first show of his stay there, worth the $200.00 for 2 tickets, for sure! I still can't figure out how he actually made it to the beach in Phucket, Thailand and back, in less than 4 minutes, live right in front of our eyes! with satellite feed live from Thailand, hard to fake, with polaroid taken on stage in Vegas, and felt pen markings on his forearm by audience member to ensure same time/day can't be faked!Fashion Show Mall on the strip worth the visit, and nice break from all the Casinos! Imperial Palace a dump, would never go back there, shows it's age, but Legends in Concert Show, worth the 1/2 price tickets we got from the Tickets 1/2 price outlet down the strip for $19.99 very good show, tight band, 10 dancers, great performers, Aretha Franlkin loook a like had the best voice, was a knockout singer worth the admission, Elton John, Look alike was dead ringer, even the gap in front teeth!The drawback of going Christmas week is many of the headliner shows are dark, as performers are off for Christmas.Prime Rib dinner at Prime Rib Loft at Orleans Hotel, for $11.95 best bargain in Vegas!", "Date": "December 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, California", "Title": "\u201cTotally unprofessional\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2876901", "Content": "The Rio has always been a fantastic establishment, and recently when we stayed there it was service on a 1st class basis. However, then the unthinkable occured! On the morning of our checkout there is a knock on the door at 8:15 am, and as I look through the peephole in the door, there is a security guard out front. So, I open the door and all of a sudden get the Wyatt Earp reception from the security guard who simply states there is a problem with your hotel bill. And then proceeds to tell me he is there to \"lock out the room\" and proceeds to enter all the while mantaining a demanor which was not necessary. Too top it off my wife is in the shower and has just gotten out and cannot egress to get her clothes! All the while the security guard tells me to call the front desk which I then proceeded to do and find out the manager has sent a security guard up to our room for a $200.00 bill issue which is not warrented. I mean we have not even checked out yet! So after advising the manager we now have a problem as this was upsetting to my wife in the most demeaning way, the manager then proceeds to advise me of The Rio's hotel policy (which based upon this situation occuring is seriously flawed) and all the while being indifferent to the situation. This was unacceptable to me, and then during the conversation once again I advise her why is there a security guard in my room? She then makes a connection and states \"there is a secuirty guard in your room\" of which I reply after several minutes of previous conversation with this \"manager\" yes! At that point I handed the phone to the security guard who proceeds to discuss a 419 code issue which who knows what it means. Subsequently seconds later he hands me the phone after speaking with the manager and proceeds to apologize for the error in the most emphatic way. I dont blame him I blame the management. Once we get down to the front desk to check out, I request to speak with the \"manager \" I had previously spoken too, and proceed to advise her that conversation with her was not necessary as given the severity of the situation we now need to speak withe the Executive Hotel Manager for the entire complex, which we subsequently did and have since been offered two free nights stay. Had they performed a courtsey call regarding this issue all of this would have been avoided and my wife would have truly enjoyed her stay. Whether we stay at the Rio again even for free is something we need to seriously consider!

It's slow out here this week and the rates were good at the Rio so I tried it. I come out here every week to work, so I've been at several of the hotels out here. I thought the Rio was a great hotel with nice views, pleasant staff, and very large, well decorated huge rooms with king bed, wall to wall floor to cieling windows, large sectional sofa, marble and glass coffee table, seperate closet area, two sinks, fridge, safe. I visited the Voodoo lounge at about 12:30 am on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty lively which is more than I can say for club Ra at Luxor. The bartender (Kenny) introduced me to a 60 year old Tequila (rare out here) that really impressed me. Did not have time this trip for any of the restaurants but trusted that they would be what I expected. To cold for the pool, and the one down side of the place is that the exercise room is connected to the Spa which they want $20/day (each person) - that's what lost them the final star on my rating. Overall, I really liked the place and when I get a chance I will check in again, but the workout charge will keep me from making it a regular stay. The casino wasn't nearly as noisey or smokey as many I've had to walk through. I seldom gamble so that's all I can say. If you get a premium room (strip view) try to get above the 20th floor (or at either end of the hallway or you may have the big RIO neon sign to look at. It's not distracting at all when you're awake, but I had to close the curtains before trying to sleep. Still, it was a great view. You'll need a taxi or the shuttle to get back and forth to the strip, it's not far, but I wouldn't walk it. If you like blues, Rio is only about a mile from the Sandollar Lounge - in my opinion, Vegas' best blues bar. I was there Monday night for their open Jam session (a very unique experience). Got really good after midnight. Be aware though that the Sandollar is not a general tourist oriented bar, it's a local place with some of everybody there, bikers, old, young, etc - It was a nice mix of people.

As soon as we walked in the door I knew I'd be glad to leave. The music was turned up too loud and (early in the evening) the place was already permeated with smoke. They didn't have the room I reserved. I booked a kingsize, they gave me 2 queens (though why someone would want 2 queens in a room for 2 people is beyond me). Apparantly the website indicates they don't actually hold the room but neither the person taking my reservation on the phone, or the receipt had any such information. The room was somewhere south of acceptable. A jar of rancid milk was left sitting outside our room (presumably from the last guests, or just a nearby room who no longer wanted it near their door?) for our entire two day stay. For it's \"suite\" nature, the whole bathroom area was pretty cramped, though having the two sinks was admittedly a nice touch. Downstairs, no matter how much others rave about the \"masquerade in the sky\" it's just a bunch of carts on wheels filled with folks who, when it's dark, do something that almost passes for dancing. Not enough to impress me, and definitely not enough to warrant the very optimistic \"best free show\" label that is so lavishly applied to the spectacle. The breakfast buffet was reasonable, but having been greated with \"welcome to the best buffet in vegas\" I quickly discovered the untruth which had just been spoken. It was good but definitely not the best. Perhaps things improve later in the day? The desserts were the saving grace of the place (the tiramasu in particular was quite delicious), but really -- how many can you eat for breakfast?

There was no problem with the room in terms of any odors, other guest's garbage and hair, etc., as some of the reviews we read had indicated we could expect.

The shrimp tempura at Hamada's was incredibly tender - the best I have ever had. Gambling - I don't, but my husband does. Because we had read the reviews, he headed over to the Gold Coast early on and won -- then returned to the Rio and won twice!! I enjoyed the variety of stores at the Rio. We both enjoyed the free show in the Masquerade area - it passes over your head and is really fun. I read that for a fee, you can be part of this show and we may try it next time.

For the most part, the employees of the Hotel were very friendly and helpful. Now, for a few complaints......the pools and jacuzzis close at 7:00 pm!!! This is Las Vegas, not the Holiday Inn in Omaha! It would have been real nice, after a night of gambling, music, etc to relax in the jacuzzi. The temperature is hovering around 100 degrees up until 7:00---who in their right mind wants to get into a jacuzzi during the day? Also, although we were quite happy with the service in general, it was a different story at the All American Grill. The first time we tried to enter it (while nicely dressed) we were told that it was closed except for employees and \"invited guests\". This was Thursday around 8:15 pm. There were around 20 people or so in there at the time. We thought it was a bit odd, but went elsewhere. We ended up back at this restaurant on Monday around 1:00 pm, starving and ready for lunch. We were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. We agreed and waited out front for 35 minutes. During that time, several people were allowed in before us. We figured they were heavy gamblers and we figured that that was part of the Vegas way of life. When we finally got into the restaurant, however, we were somewhat shocked to see that, at most, HALF of the tables and booths were being used. I have no idea why we were kept waiting for so long. I should also metnion that, during the time we were waiting at least 10-20 other people approached and were told of the wait and decided to leave---it would appear that the manager isn't doing his business any favors with this absurd seating policy. One final complaint------it strikes me as being VERY cheesey to refuse to give a glass of water to a customer. At all of the clubs and bars they will only sell bottled water ($6). I can certainly understand why a club would not want a table taken up by 5 deadbeats drinking (free) ice water, but if there are 5 people ordering expensive drinks and one of the individuals asks for a glass of water in addition to his drink...be a sport and give it to him, for Godsakes. One other complaint---the housekeepers tended to enter, or try to enter, the room despite the \"privacy\" sign and the door being bolted. I don't mean for this to be too negative-----overall, it was a good vacation.

The Seafood Buffet is $34.99 + your drink but it is well worth it if you are a seafood lover; the dessert station is incredible, they serve gourmet desserts so you get your money's worth. The parade in the sky at The Rio is very entertaining and interactive. The parades are for the most part on time nightly, so you can't miss it. The shops and vendors are VERY PRICEY but you can find some really nice deals on some of the sale items if you look hard enough. One late/early morning (however you want to look at it), I was starving but didn't want to eat anything heavy, so I stopped by the Tilted Kilt and ordered cheesesticks. Very good but alittle pricey, they were $8.95 for about 8 of them w/dipping sauce. But they were good so I didn't complain. As for gambling, well The Rio table games min. are set at $10. Pretty high for non-gamblers but if you think that's ok...go for it (we personally liked The Gold Coast casino tables, which is located across from The Rio - their tables are a min. $1 on non-peak hours and $5 on peak hours)...the slots really weren't paying off at The Rio but I was winning big at The Gold Coast. So take a trip to The Gold Coast if you feel adventurous. My hubby & I were Vegas Virgins and had a wonderful time while there but there are some things that alot of these reports don't tell VV so here are my tips/observations: 1) casinos in Vegas are a SMOKERS heaven; non-smokers beware!! (I didn't factor this in and it was very irritating to stand next to a smoker in a casino or walking by a smoker or eating because there's no such thing as a non-smoking area in a casino the whole place is open) 2) smaller casinos pay out quicker and faster than the larger casinos (try Gold Coast; Fremont St. - 4 Queens, Golden Nugget; Barbary Coast). Make sure you always get a membership card - it's free and that's how you collect points to get items for free from the casino (i.e. - comp) 3) for the best buffets at a good price for a couple, once again try smaller casinos (for example The Rio all-u-can-eat lunch buffet at World Carnival Cafe was $14.95 pp but at Gold Coast it was only $6.95 pp includes drink too!) 4) Harrah's dinner buffet is roughly $35 for a couple but it is HORRIBLE, don't waste your time 5) Harrah's show \"SKINTIGHT\" is cheesy at best, you see better performance on Cinemax, not worth $49.95 pp 6) The Monorail System isn't worth the $2 pp because the monorail is not convenient to the strip; you have to walk thru the major casinos to get back to the strip 7) Using the CAT bus system is very convenient but the buses are always crowded; recommend getting a day pass for $4 pp if you think you are going to be out and about on the strip for a full day 8) Everyone must try the Fresh Fruit Tray $12.95 at Peppermill Restrauant (across from Stardust Casino and on the same side as Riveria) = it's HUGE, delicious and very refreshing after traveling on the strip during 113 degree weather 9) Every VV must visit the Fremont St. casinos, it's located in Downtown Vegas away from the strip (take the 301 or 302 Express CAT bus directly to it) - you're winnings will double here than on the strip 10) HAVE FUN and GO WITH AN OPEN MIND, IT'S VEGAS...Everyone's experience is different but if you go to have fun other stuff won't bother you as much.... hope the above help others going to The Rio and Vegas in general....", "Date": "July 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Ga.", "Title": "\u201cGreat Pool !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2317228", "Content": "I received a coupon via email for 2 FREE nights and was able to book it July 21st and July 22nd after my stay at the Flamingo.

Well, the Rio made our other days pale in comparison! The Flamingo where we stayed for the first week, and the Lady luck for the last few days, can't hold a candle to the Rio, room wise at least. The suite was huge and gorgeous - with many amenities like a fridge, FREE in room safe (note my Flamingo review where our safe cost to use!), huge tv, and two sinks (one inside and one just outside of the large bathroom). There was also a large couch, floor to ceiling windows w/ a nice view, and nice touches like a real bath mat (not just a towel like thing, like in our other places) and shower doors (not a curtain). Another unrelated plus, was the Rio's excellent buffet (there are two, both w/ great reputations, but we only managed to eat at the Carnaval World Buffet). The food was great, the buffet HUGE, and it even had some neat choices on it like wrapped burgers as you would find at McDonalds! (This shouldn't excite me, but it did!) Overall we were very pleased w/ our stay, and proximity to some cool free entertainment (the Rio's masquerade in the sky show, performing drink girls, and the incredible view in their 51st floor bar/lounge).

We weren't overly concerned because we figured it would go away at the end of the work day - WRONG!

It was like a totally different hotel. The view still sucked, but the room had been updated, and was much nicer looking. I asked the front desk if they had had many complaints about the noise. The clerk said, \"Oh yeah - lots!\" I asked if they were giving any sort of compensation for the inconvenience, and she sheepishly gave me a voucher for $30 to be used at the hotel.

I will preface this by stating that I have also stayed at the MGM Grand, and the Mirage, and have been to Vegas about nine times in six years. First off, the Rio is definitely trying to cater to a specific crowd, although all are welcome here, including families with small children. If you are between the ages of 21-40 something, and are traveling with friends or family members, or good company in general, this is the ONLY place to stay in Vegas. The Rio is for peolple who want to party, have fun and let loose. If you are looking to impress your signifigant other, stay at a more upscale resort. Don't get me wrong, I love this place, but the rooms, while very large, are looking a bit worn down as of late, and the pool area can't really stack up against other properties in Vegas like Mirage or Mandalay Bay. Those points aside, this place is a party from check in to check out. With all of the new bars, resturants and clubs in here, it is hands down the easiest place in Vegas to get a drink. The Voo Doo Lounge is one of my favorite places on the planet, and the views at sunset absolutely can not be beat here. There is nothing like being 55 floors high on an outdoor deck, watching the sun go down, then watching Vegas come to life at night. The Voo Doo is truly a heavenly place for those who appreciate such moments. The food in the hotel is very good, so you could spend your whole stay here without leaving the grounds, but there are so many superb places to eat in this city that I would suggest getting the Zagat's Las Vegas book and choosing your dinner plans in that manner. As far as the gambling goes, I will only place sports wagers in this hotel. The slots are tight and the table limits are always high. Take the shuttle bus which runs every fifteen minutes to Harrah's and try your luck there. Also, if you are a serious gambler, you may find the bevertainers and the sky show a bit annoying, but hey this is the Rio, and the PARTY is the most important thing here. I would highly recommend this hotel to those who come to Vegas with good company and the intent on having a blast no matter what your age is.

Very large, nicely decorated, great view. However, once you step out of the room, everything is different. The casino seems dank, and dreary. The air is thick (I know, I know, it's Vegas - but many of the other casino's seem to have a solution for this) There are no coffee makers in the rooms. You have to hoof it to the coffee cart (?) and wait in line for thin, tepid pseudo-coffee (at $2/cup). Ick. The much talked about buffet was completely mediocre - at best. Totally not worth the $20 we paid. Since the Rio is not on the strip we had to either take a taxi or wait for a valet to bring our car. I estimate that we wasted at least 1-2 hours a day (in total) waiting for either our car or a taxi. Totally not the way you want to spend your hard earned vacation time.

This was the 3rd time I'd stayed there...it was his first. I'd never had a bad experience before, so when I read some of the bad reviews here, I thought maybe the place had gone downhill since I was there a couple of years ago. I need not have worried! Check in was a breeze, even at 3:00 in the afternoon. We didn't even have to wait in a line. We asked for a room in the Masquerade Tower on a high floor and got exactly what we asked for. Our room overlooked the pool area, and the view was fantastic. The only thing I don't like about the rooms at Rio is that quirky little window they have in the bathtub/shower that looks into the sleeping area. Being in our 50s (LOW 50s!), it has become necessary for me to leave a bathroom light on in hotel rooms so I can see where I'm going in the middle of the night. But with that stupid window there, you can't do that because the light will shine thru to the sleeping area. Well, my brilliant boyfriend came up with a solution. (Older people take note!) He unscrewed (but didn't take out) all of the lightbulbs around the vanity except for one. Voila! Just enough light to find the bathroom, but not keep you awake all night! (I know, I know...but it's the small pleasures in life, right?) Anyway, we had pretty good luck on the slots and the video poker machines there; didn't care much for the intrusive singing and dancing of the \"Bevertainers\"; and enjoyed the food at the Sao Paulo Restaurant, The American Grill, and especially at Buzio's! Fabulous food and desserts! We ate at the seafood buffet and found it to be satisfactory. There's plenty to choose from, but let's face it....it's a buffet. Buffets just aren't for everyone. But if you like trying new things, this is the place to do it. The desserts were to die for. Oh, and there are plenty of cocktail waitresses in the casino. At some of the casinos we went to, you could sit all day and not have anyone ask you if you'd like a drink. I love the atmosphere at Rio and I love the Scintas! See them if you can!

I've gambled here several times and slots are always stingy, but I go there for the entertainment. The rooms were much bigger than the average vegas room, and got a great internet deal for $59. The rooms have a mini fridge, which is more than the mega resorts offer, decent bathroom with a peek window in the shower, which we thought was romantic (if needed), wall to wall windows that give you a nice view, ours was facing Tropicana Blvd, so we could see the strip hotels. This was my sisters \"40th\" birthday and we did massages at the spa, where everyone was very nice, and friendly. We wanted to go to the pool during the evenings since it was over 100 degrees during the day, but it closed at 7pm, guess that's so they can get you to spend your money in the hotel. We didn't have any problems with ajoining rooms, hallways seem quiet, but we usually didn't come in until 2am most mornings, after driving to the strip, having a few drinks and tired anyway. The Valet was quick and friendly, my check out was a breeze but then again I left at 3am... The seafood buffet was pricy, but good. The 24 hr restaurant has good food and reasonable prices, service was OK for the most part. Overall, the Rio is a great place to stay if your an adventurer and don't mind it's location off the strip. I wouldn't consider this a place for the kids, it can get kinda 'riske'. They have a good mardi gras thing going with shows from the sky. If your looking for somewhat inclusive stays stick with Ramada, Residence Inn, Hilton Grand Vacations or some of those places. I've stayed at Luxor, Aladdin, Tropicana, MGM and none offer coffee pots, but then again I've had to realize and research they want you to spend your money in their establishments. So do like myself & invest in a little coffee pot, to give you that jolt in the mornings.

We used all the Rio's amenities and had no problems. After going out all day and night in Vegas,it was nice coming HOME to the Rio.My only complaint(even though I know Vegas caters to the weekend crowds) is that I wish more of the clubs had more entertainment during the week nights, as my wife and I are dancers, of rather high quality if I do say so myself. I find it irritating when people complain about the Rio, EVEN when they have comp. rooms. When we are on vacation, we know ahead of time what to expect because WE Plan.

We were staying on the strip so we caught the free shuttle over from Harrah's. However it was slow, hot and crowded so on the way back we took a cab. We went over to see Chippendales. I had a 2 for 1 coupon. Show was good, but I do not think it would have been worth full price. Everyone in the room seem to be enjoying theirselves. Before the show we had dinner at the Voodoo Cafe. It was at the top of the hotel and we got a seat by the window. The view was spectacular. We ordered a cocktail that was made for 2. The name was something like Witch Doctors Brew. It was in a huge glass that came to the table smoking (from dry ice.) We got a lot of comments from others in the restaurant and 2 other couples ended up ordering the drink. It was served in a HUGE glass with straws that were about 3 feet long. It was fun to drink and one of those must do things in vegas. As for the drink itself, it was very good and strong. It cost about $20 but it was enough of a drink for 2 and we never needed to order another cocktail. For dinner I got the special of the evening which was a salmon filet, with crab salad topping and fingerling potatoes. I am from the east coast and eat seafood all the time. I did not have high hopes for seafood in the middle of the desert, but I was surprised. It was fresh, tasty and expertly prepared. My husband had a crab and scallop plate. He also thought it was good and well prepared. The service was exceptional. We had a team of 2 waiters who took very good care of us. They were very attentive, but not intrusive. We were seated at a candlelit table overlooking the city. It was really a romantic setting and we both really enjoyed it. It wasn't cheap, but we really do not mind paying for good food and service. The bill came to $126.33 with the tip. Now don't forget this included a $20 cocktail and $12 worth of water. I was really dehydrated and we ordered 2 bottle of spring water. You had the option of tap water for no charge, but I am a water snob and really needed a good glass of water. So if you subtract water, cocktail and tip the charge was only $53 for dinner and dessert. Which was well worth it. You should give the place a try.

With the Palm as a comparison, at least it has two major clubs and great resturants to help soften its location whoas. The Rio is about a mile of very busy traffic away from the strip, and thus if have plans to go somewhere on the strip, especially at night, you had better plan ahead to get there.

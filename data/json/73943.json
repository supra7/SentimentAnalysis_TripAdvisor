Small welcoming Lobby Living Room and beautiful old spanish structure. I stayed in a casita on the property of which there are a few. The room was magnificent and just recently remodeled. Fireplace, Patio overlooking garden and hammock and the mountains. All the first class amenities you would expect including a two headed shower and marble bath, king bed and comforable chairs in a beautiful color palette. The restaurant is also beautiful and the grounds with its winding paths and beautiful pool and spa area are a treat. I would strongly reccomend this hotel.

The atmosphere is relaxed and the service is truly superb. Spa services were also top notch. The only exception was dinner at T. J. Cook's.

My son's steak was overcooked even though he ordered it medium. His roasted vegetables were inedible (very, very roasted). I ordered the Carbonara and the top layer was very dry.

The room was much more spacious than the floor plan let on...we took a few trips around town with Jenna's help at the concierge and she steered us wonderfully every step of the way. I can't say enough good things about the service, old world charm, understated 5-star luxury (you feel like a king, yet you also feel comfortable walking down to the pool in a bathrobe and bathing suit), and the exceptional detail given to your every desire by the staff (they ALL remembered mine and y wife's name).

Stayed here over labor day weekend and cannot get over how charming, cozy, and beautiful it was. All the good reviews could not be more accurate. The service staff was the most consistently great staff we've ever encountered. This can't be a fluke or good luck, must be part of their business plan! Weeks before we arrived, concierge Mona helped not just with suggestions but made arrangements for every detail from hot air ballooning to horseback riding to spa appointment. She kept in touch through email and phone calls to clarify details of our trip and to remind us of all sorts of things (like don't plan any outdoor activities between 9a and sunset during the Arizona summer! - thank goodness she warned us!). Upon arrival we met the quickest and most courteous valets in the business. While we were still pulling in looking lost at 11p trying to make sure we were in the right spot, two valets appeared, one on each side of the car and gently whisked away the car keys and our luggage and took care of everything! Everytime we needed the car they had it waiting for us outside in what seemed to be under 60seconds and every time we returned we were always greeted with two valets to help escort us and our baggages out of the car. At the pool was a staff of one gentleman (jose) who was unbelievably efficient, friendly, and ran the operation like a well oiled machine. It was scary how he always seemed to anticipate our every need well before we even realized it. Before we realized we were parched he was right there with large cups of lemon ice water - and refilled it well before it ever reached halfway empty. If we looked a little uncomfortable from a towel that was too wet, before we could decide what to do Jose was there with a dry towel...and he provided this degree of excellent service to every guest at the pool! We loved how well this resort seamlessly blended indoor and outdoor space. Very classy and comforting decor all around. We stayed in one of the designer casitas. Very cozy and clean, but was disappointed that patio doors opened up to communal walking path and there was no view of the mountains. Will try for a balcony suite next time. Room may not be as spacious as other resorts, but decor very unique - they even had some classic books laying on ledges around the room which was a nice touch. Spa massages were okay, and once again decor and use of indoor/outdoor space made it worth experiencing.

The service level is very good, and the feel of the property is amazingly exclusive. That's partly because the resort is small (and so more personal). It's also because the grounds have been carefully designed with many plants, flowers, and courtyards, so that the overall sense is of \"old money\" and privacy. It made us feel rich, and we didn't break the bank staying there! The rooms are not as luxurious as the grounds, though they are definitely well-appointed and spacious. You won't mind, though, because you'll want to spend your time exploring the courtyards and hanging out at the pool. The spa was gorgeous, and also broken in smaller rooms for privacy and comfort. Other pluses: the on-site restaurant is excellent for both breakfast and dinner; the valets are quick and friendly; the resort fee explicitly covers tips (except for meals and spa services). The cocktails at the lounge are very good, and half-price during happy hour. A few weaker points: the pool is on the small side, creating a little tension between families whose kids want to play and the adults who want to drift aimlessly about or sit near the edge with their Blackberrys or books. The staff did a fine job managing the situation. The turn-down service ran far too late for our tastes, so that we had to decline services on several evenings. Finally, a good deal of noise carries between floors and not all rooms have balconies or patio areas -- ask for a top-floor room, and for a balcony if that matters to you.

We were simply entranced upon arrival. The lush, Spanish-feeling grounds twist and turn with many walkways, a few courtyards, porticos and many private nooks. The heady scent of all the flowers that grace the grounds, mingled with scents emanating from the spa, is intoxicating. Entering our room, we were greeted by low-lighting, a relaxing CD playing gently in the background, gorgeous decor, and the most comfortable bed and pillows. ( I'm really big on bed comfort..that's THE most important thing to me.) When you enter the extremely private, quiet pool area, you are gently greeted with an ice-cold glass of water with lemon, and the most comfortable chaise lounges. We were at Royal Palms for 2 nights, then took a trip to Sedona where we stayed at a mediocre hotel for a night. We had planned to stay in Sedona for two nights, but when we called the Royal Palms to see if they had availability for that night, they gave us a great rate that wasn't much different than the dull Sedona hotel, and we gleefully raced back to Royal Palms!

It has a really nice feel to it. All of the rooms are set around gardens and pools and you would not believe there are 120 rooms. The reception is tiny, so don't expect to be wowed by marble and chandeliers. It is like you are staying at somebodies home (all be it rather large!). I can't praise the staff and service at this hotel enough. Evan from the valet, Jose-Caro, Dustin and the others from the pool were fantastic and really treated you like royalty. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they constantly topped up iced water at the poolside meaning you were not forced to keep buying drinks. Overall, definitely the best place I have ever stayed and will definitely be returning and we have stayed in some high end hotels around the world. Old town Scottsdale is about 5 minutes in the car and downtown parking is free. That brings me on to resorts fee's. As we had two Valencia suites it was a total of $56 a day plus tax but this covered tips, paper, parking and wifi. If you factor it into the room price at booking it is not an issue. Try the T Cooks lounge. The bar food is excellent and the happy hour is 5-7pm and their was a reverse one later. We did not use the main T Cook restaurant but the locals in the lounge highly recommended it. Prices seemed ok compared to UK prices for similar standard fare. Finally the standard of the room was excellent with top end furnishings and spotlessly clean.

The singing duo even took our requests and did their best to please. As did all the other staff at the resort, especially so at the pool. Already in March the temperatures were nudging the upper nineties and the staff kept running up an down making sure that the pool guests were supplied with endless glasses of lemon iced water.

The bathroom was in between the bedroom and the sitting area (where the sofa sleeper was that my daughter slept on) so that all traffic needed to be through the bathroom. The room was also small and had a view on a small back alley. This was our only negative for the hotel. But then, it is an older property and we were not surprised by some quirkiness.

I said it before- if you can't relax and unwind here- you can't do it anywhere. Around every corner is a bench or garden or trickling fountain or hammock. Poolside staff re-fills your water (and drink order) constantly and the valet staff will remember your name- 1 year later. The rooms are lovely with attention to detail and romance.

The pool is open 24 hours- go later and enjoy complete privacy. Its still 80 degrees out after dinner. Most telling to me- the number of Phoenix/Scottdale residents who \"staycation\" here. They don't go to the Biltmore or the Phoenician- when they want to feel like they are apart and away from the everyday world they go to the Palms. One note if you are deciding what room to book: the spa suites have a full bath, full living room and master bedroom. They are all divisible by large pocket doors. (Great for quiet time). They are modern and clean. The downside: they are in a standard hotel-type wing- which means you can have someone above you or below. If you want to be esconsed in total privacy- book a casita. The rooms aren't quite as nice, but they are very secluded. Its a personal preference. Get to the pool (early), grab a cocktail, have Matt prop up the umbrella to give you shade, and forget the world. (or grab a hammock under the palms and read a book, or watch the bunnies.)

The Royal Palms exceeded our expectations each time. We celebrated our anniversary there this year. If you like being steps away from the pool, the spa, the restaurant, your car... yet at the same time in a private, elegant resort..this is the place for you. It is designed as a destination, so you could stay on grounds the whole time if your goal is to relax by the pool and get spa treatments. But we also took day trips, and the concierge was excellent in helping us plan then. The pool service, valet, and bell staff were like none other. Your water glass was always filled with ice water, no order from pool side was too much, and they were always willing to please. At poolside, Jose especially was exceedingly pleasant, helpful, and professional. He was always there to ask if we wanted something. When we went out at for our day trips, the valets had our car available virtually instantly..within a minute or two of us asking. Everyone we met was pleasant and helpful, and was patient in answering our questions and responding to our requests. Our room, and many others, opened up onto a large patio area with a fountain, reflecting pool, and gas fire pits with many places to relax. There are many cozy 'nooks' to sit and relax. The spa treatments were great (I'd need to write a separate review to tell you about them). The Royal Palms is right off busy Camelback Road, but you'd never know it. There is a long palm tree lined driveway which sets it back from the road, and gives the Royal Palms an immediate, elegant feel. It was very quiet, and you immediately feel calm and comfortable. I think the proximity to Camelback Road is a real plus; it means you can easily go on day trips. Also, the Royal Palms was less than a 30 min drive from the Phoenix airport. I'd recommend eating breakfast at T Cooks, lunch at the pool, a day trip, and then dinner at T Cooks. After dinner, sit by the fountains and the outdoor fireplace, and enjoy a nice drink. The Royal Palms is not a large hotel (I'm not sure of the number of rooms. I'm sure their website would have that information). The feel is very personal and feels customized to your needs. The T. Cooks restaurant is on grounds, and serves excellent food. I believe it is a top ranked restaurant in the Phoenix area in its own right. You can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. The Royal Palms is not your 'big box' type destination. Although children are welcome there, it would probably not be the place for large groups with lots of children to entertain. If you are celebrating something like an anniversary, its a wonderful place. Or if you need a relaxing getaway, you can't do better than the Royal Palms.

He didn't stop for a minute. Equally wonderful were the men who valeted the car. They always offered directions and advice. No matter how busy they were, they too greeted us by name. Royal Palms is a bit quiet. Not much to do during the week. It is a bit confusing as to what the resort fee covers. But what it may lack in activities, it more than makes up for it with some of the best customer service I have ever had. If they could clone Jose and the guys who valet, they could really teach some other better known resorts a thing or two.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaconsfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS HOTEL AND WONDERFUL STAFF\u201d", "Author": "CAS27", "ReviewID": "UR102230790", "Content": "A gorgeous bijoux hotel in lovely grounds and in the evening, the courtyards are beautifully.

However the bar alongside T Cook's is great place to spend an evening and the bar meals are fab. Jason, the Bar Manager, runs a superb operation and is charming. We stayed one night in an Estate Room with a very large bath which in hindsight was actually nicer than the Designer Casita we spent the following 7 nights in. Designer Casita 105 should be avoided - the swing doors used by the staff are noisy from about 5 am until late at night and there was definitely something noisy going on on the roof (roof rats?). The room itself was nice, with a welcoming fire but the bath was small and the front and back patios were not particularly inviting and had no view.

We were in town to visit some relatives who live a few blocks up the street. We had stayed at the Biltmore previously, but thought that we would give the Royal Palms a try due to its location and glowing reviews. We booked a Valencia Casita with fireplace. We were initially placed in the most remote room on the right hand side of the property, room 154. The room was a little dark as it was at the very end of the complex. The courtyard in front of the room was private, yet had no view (not the worst thing in the world). Our biggest problem the first night was that a roof rat (yes, they are common in Phoenix due to the ripe citrus at this time of the year) was happily gnawing on something in the ceiling/wall on and off from about 11:30 pm until 6:30 am. We notified management first thing in the morning, and were given a different casita about three doors down. This was a slightly smaller, corner room; much brighter and had a view of Camelback. We preferred this room much better than the first. No further roof rat issues after the move. There was a fairly significant cold spell in Phoenix that week. Interestingly enough, there is a carbon monoxide vent above the floorboard in the rooms which is square space open to the outside. Needless to say, this let in a significant amount of cold air, so we covered it over. I understand that this is a safety issue due to the gas fireplace in the room, but it was essentially like having a window open until we figured out what was letting in the cold air. The resort was quiet. The grounds are very well maintained and pretty. Service was very quick and friendly. We ordered room service for breakfast and dinner on a couple of days. The food was OK, not stellar. A little disappointing since T. Cooke's is their signature restaurant. Overall, I would recommend it given the location, beautiful grounds, and solitude (minus the roof rats!). It is more of a couples resort. Would probably be boring for kids. We did not use the spa during our stay and did not eat at T.

From the moment you arrive with attentive bell boy service to the moment you depart reluctantly you will feel as though you have had an extradordinary experience.

The resort grounds is stunning, lots of palm trees, orange trees and vegetation that make you feel like you have escaped the city. Besides the pool, with cabanas, outdoor cafe, and lots of sitting areas in various spots in the garden like grounds the Spanish Colonial architecture transports you to another time. Our room was a Valencia Casita with antique looking wooden doors, wooden shutters and tiled bathroom. The 4 poster bed with curtains provided an added royal feel to the accomodation. Unfortunately for us it rained during our weekend so we never truly got to sit outside on our private deck area, or any of the poolside spots but we did turn on the electric fireplace and enjoy room service. The restaurant TJ Cooks is great - I ordered lemon filled french toast and I must say it felt decadent as it was like eating cake for breakfast. We did the girls weekend package so we had a spa treatment included and this was wonderful. Truly an escape filled with relaxation and serenity. The attention to detail in service and style is outstanding. Location was good for us as we did not drive in Phoenix so relied on cabs to shopping malls and the airport. Depending what else you plan on doing the resort is a great location to feel like you got away and got pampered. What comes with this extraordinary experience is a higher than norm price. For us it was a splurge so plan on a budget that includes taking advantage of at least one spa treatment, and a meal or two at the restaurant.

This hotel is very, very nice. With only 107 rooms, you certainly don't feel like you're at some mega-resort. And therefore the service from the staff is really quite personalized. We stayed in a \"Designer Casita\". It was extremely clean, well decorated, and generally a very relaxing room. We had a patio off of the front of the room, and a smaller walled in patio out the back door of our room. The bath room was nice, with a separate shower and tub. A small flat screen TV was appropriate for the room as well. The nightly turndown service is a nice touch, with chocolates being left each night, and fresh bottled water. Despite usually feeling like \"Resort\" Fees are a huge rip off, I didn't mind it here. The $25/day fee covers all gratuities for the staff, valet parking, etc. it's nice never having to bring any cash for tipping when you leave the room. The service is what really sets this place apart from the rest of the pack. It seems everyone you meet remembers your name, and has a smile. I don't know how much they're paying their staff, but it must be pretty good, because the staff is just awesome. Specifically, the staff at the pool is just outstanding. The best I've ever experienced. Brandon and Jose are just top notch. The second you walk into the pool area, they are running over with cold cups of lemon-water, helping to find you open chairs, and moving umbrellas around to make sure you have shade. And it keeps up all day, bringing you waters, smoothy samples, cold face towels. They even come by automatically to adjust your umbrella as the sun moves across the sky. It really was pretty amazing, and Jose and Brandon were sort of the highlight of the resort. They were friendly and social, without being an intrusion to your relaxation. There was literally not one thing that anyone would ask for that they couldn't handle. I hope they pay these guys really well. We ate at T. Cooks one night for dinner. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was very nice. Worth trying at least once while you are there. No stay is perfect, so here are my two complaints: -Smoking at the pool: The resort claims to be smoke free, but that only relates to the inside of the rooms. Once outdoors, it's all fair-game, and their is an abundancy of ashtrays around the resort. The problem with allowing smoking at the pool is that the lounge chairs are all fairly close together, so there's no escaping if someone near you lights up. Additionally, on 1 day we had some guy lounging in the pool puffing on a big cigar. The entire pool area was filled with cigar smoke, with people around us actually coughing from the smoke. There are multiple places right outside the pool to light up, just let people use those areas. If you have an aversion to second hand smoke at all, don't stay here, it's that simple. - The \"Royal Palms Soundtrack\": There is a song that is on repeat everywhere you look everywhere you go, and by the end of the stay, I thought I might lose my mind if I heard it again. It's on in the room when you check in. You turn in it off, but it's on in the room again after turndown service. It's on in the spa. It's on in some of the public areas. Flip on the TV, and it's on repeat on hotel channel. I get it already, you want to sell me the CD, but enough is enough. Overall, great place with even better staff.

Another reviewer mentioned a sense of a \"tip mentality\" but we didn't experience that. The $25+ daily resort fee covers all tips & gratuities which was published in several areas throughout our stay. We began our 25th anniversary getaway with a couples massage at the resort spa. The massage therapists were fantastic, giving an excellent massage, and were both very professional. Desk staff: the mostly female employees were friendly and professional. But there was a gentleman working the front area who gave an unfriendly vibe and both hubby & I felt we were intruding. I saw him interacting with other guests and noticed his lack of friendliness; he never did crack a smile. Pool: We enjoyed the cozy pool and enjoyed socializing with other guests. Homero did an excellent job refilling ice water and raced around filling food & drink orders. He was very accomodating and a joy. We really missed him the following day as the other staff person was adequate in his role but not outstanding. Fitness room: Small, several treadmills, and a few weight machines. It's open 24/7 but the fruit wasn't fresh and the water containers weren't replenished. Someone should probably check on the freshness of the items from time to time. I worked out at 7:00 a.m. and found it lacking. Room: We booked a casita and it was very lovely. Housekeeping did a fine job keeping our room loving great. T. Cook's: Was really looking forward to an excellent experience and it was good, but certainly not great. The best part of the meal were the desserts, and they were excellent. Be sure to try the chocolate fantasy. Romance quotient: The resort knew we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and spread lovely rose petals on our table at T. Cook's. They also decorated our dessert plates with \"Happy 25th Anniversary.\" Very nice touches. At the pool, newlyweds shared how the resort gave them a rose petal turndown, chocolate strawberries, champagne, and a lovely card. We thought that was fantastic. After dinner, we returned to our casita and found a rose petal turndown, the chocolates, and a card from our friends. I learned later that the resort does note big anniversaries but told me, \"your friend beat us to the punch.\" Oops.... I certainly wasn't expecting the rose petals, etc. but a card from the resort would've been nice. The resort is beautiful and it felt like we weren't in Arizona.

There is not one aspect of this hotel that is not divine. Service: friendly yet unobtrusive and professional -- from the valets, to the pool attendants to the spa to the excellent restaurant. Architecture: gorgeous and intimate, the gardens lush, cared for but left just a tiny bit wild to evoke the casual elegance of hacienda living. Hotel room amenities: the best mattress I have slept on, memorable proprietary bath supplies and robes. We have had some difficult family business here in Phoenix and I originally chose this hotel because it was 1) inexpensive and 2) close to where I had to be. I spent two nights here in late April alone in a room in the Alvadora section -- the room was smallish, but with a great bed and linens, a large closet and a huge gorgeous deep tub and seperate shower, and a small patio that delightfully opened onto an inner courtyard with comfy sofas and outdoor fireplaces -- I think these are the least expensive rooms in the house. I had a superb scrub/massage experience at the spa, complete with my own suite of spa rooms with a bathtub that opened onto a private courtyard for sunbathing with a fireplace, outdoor shower and flowering perfection. I enjoyed a delicious dinner at the hotel restaurant, alone at a table outside under a heat lantern with fires going at either end of the courtyard. In the morning I had my breakfast tray in the shared courtyard outside my room while catching up on my emails -- the wireless internet extends to the gardens and poolside too. Despite the stress of my business, I left the hotel feeling like I had been on a mini vacation! That same business brought my husband and I and our three teenaged sons back 5 weeks later. This time we rented the presidential suite and connecting room -- three fireplaces, 3 terraces, a full kitchen and dining room and two lovely bedrooms. Lovely art and interesting books and antiques. The best of renting a private home without the time commitment and hassle. The location of the suite is perfect -- down it's own winding path from the entrance courtyard so it is convenient and very private. We were greeted within a half hour of arriving in the suite with a fruit/cheese/nut platter and a bottle of Sine Qua Non Rose wine -- delicious and perfectly chilled. We had spent 9 hours getting here with no food and we fell on that platter and the wine with alacrity and once we had caught our breath, realized that this was no ordinary fruit plate but a small bit of nirvana with perfectly ripened bits of cheese, candied pecans, roasted walnuts, and perfect fruit. And of course that Sine Qua Non vineyard lives up to its own mystique. I had a massage yesterday with a different therapist than the one I had 5 weeks ago, because she was on holiday, and the new one was JUST AS GOOD. My husband and I are going tomorrow again because I wanted him to see the spa suites. We woke up very early this morning and decided to go for a hike and arrived at the valet desk at 6 am where were greeted immediately, given knowlegable advice and handed bottles of water -- which was something we hadn't thought about but which is a necessity in this climate, as we discovered halfway through our lovely hike. This is service at its best, delivered from the guys in charge of one's car: anticipating your needs and catering to them without having to be asked. Having spent so many years in Asia, I am never quite sure what to expect in terms of service at hotels in the US, but this hotel has the most marvelously trained staff I have seen anywhere.

Others in our group were upgraded to larger and better rooms and they were happy. My daughter had the honeymoon suite and it was beautiful. My brother got the suite that had 2 fireplaces outside of their rooms...their suite was amazing...they had 5 in their group and they all stayed in the suite. They also charge you a $25.00 resort fee which was supposed to be included when I reserved with hotels.com but they said I had to pay b/c it was NOT included and they would not bend for anything. Had lunch at the swimming pool one day and it was great food and the waiter was so gracious and wonderful. The staff there couldn't do enough for your (except take the $25.00 resort fee off).

We chose Arizona for our vacation since we really just wanted sunshine, and it was hurricane season elsewhere. We chose this hotel based on TA. The staff were excellent across the board, in all departments. The front desk, valets, pool bartender and restaurant staff were all great. Breakfast was good. We didn't love the food at the T. Cook's restaurant at dinnertime, though, and would suggest eating elsewhere at night. (Also, FYI, we did go one night for happy hour to eat at the bar in T. Cook's, and apparently the price is based on when you finish your meal, not when you order it--we paid full price even though we arrived well within the designated period. We didn't feel like saying anything, though.) The concierge was especially helpful and set up a great day for us in Sedona. The gym is clean, and the equipment is great. As others have mentioned, this place is designed such that you often feel like you have it all to yourself. The grounds are lush and beautiful and really unlike what you would expect in the desert. We first stayed in a Montevista Terrace room. It was new and sparklingly clean, with a very comfy bed and a gorgeous soaking tub. The terrace was not at all private, though, and the room was pretty noisy from people in the hallway. This section is more like a regular hotel. We discussed the possibility of moving at some point during the week to a more quiet and private location, and the staff were very accomodating. They gave us the choice of moving to one of the deisgner casitas, and showed us two of them. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our room. I was really impressed by that, since obviously that didn't have to do that for us. The desinger casitas are not as new or as squeaky-clean, but are more private and tucked away on he property. They have patios in front and in back, with the back ones entirely closed off by a wall for privacy. If you want privacy, this is it. The tubs are shallow and nowhere near as nice as those in the Montevista rooms, and in fact the staff mentioned that as their big drawback. But, the walk-in shower with a skylight is just a nice. Our designer casita did have a couple of other weird drawbacks, though. As another person mentioned, the wooden blinds don't close all the way so this detracts from the sense of privacy a little, and means the room was never dark at night. Also, the AC/heating system turned on and off all night, and each time it started up there was a sound of five taps followed by the sound of rushing air. Ear plugs and a blindfold are a good idea, but light sleepers should just not stay in these rooms. Actually, the hallway noise with the Montevista room was probably no worse, and at least that room was dark. All in all, both rooms were lovely, but each has its own drawbacks. Hopefully this info can help someone decide. If you are dying for sunshine and want a hotel with great service, why not go to Arizona? We had a great time. There isn't a ton to do in the area, but it is really close to Camelback mountain which is a fun and challenging hike (though not for those who are afraid of heights). I would suggest renting a car from the start, which will give you the freedom to hit the grocery down the street for basics, great restaurants in Scottsdale (try Deseo at the Westin Kierland; skip entrees and instead try all the ceviches and apps), shopping, side trips to Sedona, In N Out Burger (!), etc.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cSpoil Yourself\u201d", "Author": "SDteach126", "ReviewID": "UR50774377", "Content": "Royal Palms is a treat for the senses.

I have stayed at the Royal Palms countless times since they reopened in '97. I can unequivocally state that this is the most unique, exceptional resort in the US or Europe. You are treated as if you are a guest at a treasured friend's private estate. The property and grounds reflect a unique combination of lavish decor that refuses to be overwhelming or common. Refined Spanish-Tuscan hacienda estate. The casitas and designer casitas provide a lovely respite for privacy, relaxation and romance. Beautiful accomodations (including decor, bedding, furnishings) coupled with well-planned appointments. Hidden niches, fountains, hammocks and seating areas provide ample opportunities for an intimate chat, glass of wine, shared dessert, etc. The staff at this property is the most exceptional I have encountered anywhere. From the General Manager to the housekeeping staff, they reflect care and consistently superb competence unparalleled at any other resort property. Working with colleagues of this quality makes it difficult to exceed expectaions, yet that is exactly what Rick and Jose, who man the poolside Cabana, have accomplished. They are gentlemen who view their service as a rewarding career rather than a way to pay the bills as you may find at other resorts. Even if you are particular, they are likely to anticipate your need before you do. They will mix a superb smoothie or cocktail inspired by your personal preferences and ensure your comfort while lounging poolside. On one occasion, Rick went to a store early in the morning before coming to work and purchased several decks of cards (his time, his $) to compile a pinochle deck for my husband and I because we had forgotten ours. They also perfectly concocted a special beverage for us based solely upon a distant memory. Jose tracked down my favorite pop within moments of my unique request. These are merely a few examples from our more recent stays. We never stay elsewhere because we know it would disappoint compared to our experiences here. Although the property and grounds are so exceptional that they themselves provide compelling reason to travel from any location to stay here, the staff transforms this exceptional resort into an incomprable destination.

Much to my surprise, this hotel was rated #1 in Phoenix by reviewers. And boy were they not wrong! This is a beautiful property located within luscious gardens of palms, flowers and gorgeous foilage! Unfortunately, we were not able to see flowers as it was 116 degrees. All trails lead to \"casita\" style accomodations. The property gives the feel of a luxury old fashioned mediterranean home (mansion) instead of a commercial type hotel. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the excellent valet staff who took our luggage and escorted us to the front desk. The front desk staff was very very attentive to our every need. Check in was smooth and we were greeted with a \"happy anniversary\" - we were celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary. In addition, the hotel presented us with a gift platter of cheese and fruit for the occasion sent to our room. LOCATION: Location is great - it is actually a few blocks from The Phoenician and very close to Scottsdale. Malls, Restaurants, Nightlife and other entertainment. ROOM: We were assigned Casita #112 - no two casitas are alike so this review is based only on this casita. Although I booked this as a \"designer\" casita (at a higher than the \"special $90\" rate), after entering it mostly resembled a \"southwestern\" style casita. I didn't confirm this with the front desk as it was lovely anyway. The decor was of mediterranean and spanish style. Very comfy and well appointed bed (king) and two nice chairs with a table. A soft chair with ottoman was provided facing the TV and a mini-bar. The casita has a door leading to its own private courtyard in the back that is furnished with two chairs and a table surrounded by a small flower and plant garden. Very private. The room also has double french doors with plantation shutters leading to a front courtyard also furnished with patio furniture. In-room internet ethernet, two two-line telephones, LCD TV, clock radio with nice smoothing spa music cds, candles and matches, in-room coffee and tea are provided. Also provided is an iron, ironing table, shoe shining kit (although the hotel provides complimentary daily shoe shine) and daily paper. Minibar items are for purchase. Turn down service nightly. On our first night, we had a Rose Petal Heart placed on the bed upon turn down (this was ordered in advance). The bathroom is very large with a very very large shower. My only concern is the bathroom has no a/c vent - only a small window and a skylight that at 116 degree temperature this becomes intolerable to be in there. An exhaust is provided but does not do the job of removing the extreme heat. Blow dryer, lighted mirror , many towels, slippers, robe and shower amenities is provided. The shower gels, soaps and shampoos are all orange blossom oil based - wonderful! Bought a bottle of lotion at the spa to take home (@$22USD). DINING: Dined on Jul 19 at T.Cook's - the hotel restaurant - a fantastic experience. Very quiet and romantic atmosphere. Inside or outside patio choices - with the heat we chose inside. Our server, John, was excellent - tended to our every need. The food and dessert were of first class. We were a party of four each having, Ribs, Poulet Chicken, and Fish and lobster. Highly recommend the restaurant - reservations prior to hotel arrival is suggested. SPA: We had a couple's massage which was excellent. The spa facility is very beautiful. We did not use the pool as it was very hot during the day but found the poolside area as lovely as the rest of the property. PROBLEM: We did encounter problems with the housekeeping department. Our room was never cleaned unless we called and then we still waited for them to appear. We would leave our room around 10am and return on average about 3 to 3:30pm where we would find our room in the same condition it was left in. On the third evening we informed the front desk of this problem and experienced some difficulty with the front desk staff - Ms. Jennifer. She appeared not to know how to handle this complaint. When we requested to speak to the manager, she informed us that the manager was -conveniently for her - not available and a message would be relayed. We never heard from the manager that evening. The following morning upon check out we informed the front desk staff who immediately referred us to the front manager, Ms. Beth Friddle who quickly apologized for the lack of service of housekeeping and the behavior of Ms. Jennifer. Ms. Friddle is a professional at her job. This is the only problem we encountered at this establishment. OVERALL: For a wonderful romantic experience, I highly recommend this hotel with its majestic views, surroundings and fantastic staff! We certainly will be returning in the near future.

The hotel is also in a great location for both Scottsdale and Phoenix, which really is just one big place. There's not much to choose between the Royal Palms or the Four Seasons but I would go for the Palms as the location is much more central. The only other place that rivals these resorts is Sanctuary on Camelback it is lovely but maybe a little to modern for my taste.The other resorts are just too large to be personal enough for me, as nice as they are.

Cook's, on many occasions when in Phoenix, but I had never spend the night in one of its many types of accomodations. The prices seemed steep and I preferred the more discreet location and ambiance of its \"sister\" resort, the under-renovation Hermosa. However, I have rarely stayed in an accomodation anywhere in the United States, or elsewhere, that had the high quality of service at every level than the Royal Palms. From tthe minute I arrived by taxi from the airport, windblown and sand blasted after several days in chilly Flagstaff, when I was prfomptly and cordially met by the valets and escorted to the front desk, I felt special. In the cool, classy, intimate front office, I was quickly checked in, my advance request for newspapers had already been taken care of, my request for an early check in was accomodated, and my bags were promptly delivered to my Designer casita, which was atucked behind a wonderfully soft but not too sweet smeloling orange tree and trellises of fuscias. A smal table and chairs, at which I ate the delicious breakfasts delivered to my room, daily; read my papers; and stared up at the black sky and clear stars, in the evening. It was not fronting Camelback drive and the neighbors on the other side of the wall were accoodating,k so it was extremely quiet. I also stayed in a Valencia room which was similarly quiet ad a bit larger. The bathrooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. The meals are delicious, and room service is prompt and done with a lot of class. The grounds are simply gorgeous. FLowers, trees, green grass. Lots of places to just sit and look at the stars, fountains, read, or close your eyes. It is quiet, romantic, adn utterly peaceful. The spa, which has been recently renovated, is unique. Many of the treatments are done outdoors, in total privacy. There are outdoor jacuzzis set in stone and steam baths. My spa treatments were wonderful and the technicians were very professional. There is a large unheated swimming pool and an adjacent heated spa, and that was my only real source of unhappiness. SMoking is allowed at the pool, and it was annoying and fairly constant. While a couple of cigar smokers were required to do their puffing across the pool in cabanas, the smoke did waft its way across. THe bar/dining area at the pool can get very noisy as the sound carries, and much of the talking is by the pool attendants/ waiters. They were generally very good about constantly providing free iced water to guests and fairlyl regularly making rounds to see if anyone wanted food or drinks but sometimes they would just disappear for long stretches, or carry on long, and loud, conversations with certain guests. Another problem was allowing very young children in the jacuzzi. They were loud, and also used it as a swimming pool. The most annoying occurrence at the pool, which was constant, was the use of cell pjhones. They should be banned. For a place that is otherwise offering total rest and relaxation, it is simply not possible at the pool, with phones constantly going off and people of all nationalities shouting to whomever was on the other end. The restaurant is also loud when it is full. The acoustics are bad, and woe to you if you are seated next to a table of four or more, especially if they are heavy drinkers, and, particularly if they are a group of businessmen, and that was a frequent occurrence. Therewere three of us, and we practically had to shout to hear each other. I recommend you eat outdoors on one of the patios, which are heated on chilly desert evenings. Back to the valets, they were very quick to call cabs or limos, suggest alternate modes of transportation, including even, when possible, driving me to a destination themselves. They quickly and professionally greet dinner or other guests, including mine, and park and retrieve cars better than I've ever experienced. They are polite, humerous, well dressed, and knowledgeable about the area. In short, they make a great foirst and last impression. The business center is open twenty four hours a day, which is very convenient for those wh are working (or at least communicating) in different time zones. There is a small fitness center as well. The Royal Palms is now be my \"go to\" place in Arizona, if not anywhere in the US, for a relaxing vacation destination that also has many activites nearby if rest and relaxation isn't enough, such as hiking, golf, art museums, botanical gardens, spring training baseball games , and, downtown, professional sporting and cultural venues. High quality shopping and gourmet restaurants are also within a few minutes' drive. If you want to feel very special and be treated in a classy yet low key manner by professionals at their bvest, go to the Royal Palms.

Having attended weddings and eaten in the restaurant before, I hoped to add a guest room visit to my future. Let me just say, this hotel did not disappoint. When we drove in Evan, the valet/bellperson, was fantastic. While he unloaded the bags, another valet cleaned out the back seat of our car, throwing away cups and the flotsam and jetsum of a long car trip. Impressive, I thought. Evan escorted us to the Front Desk where we were checked in swiftly and it was off to our rooms with our escort leading the way. We wound through fountain-seranaded courtyards and colonades covered with bright bouganvilla. At every terminus of a walkway, we seemed to encounter enchanted private gardens or outdoor art. Later, we would wander through the hotel grounds, or rather explore the intimate gardens and fireplaces one finds in the most out of the way places. It gives the hotel a personal charm, a sense of privacy and enchantment that seemed to make (almost) irrelevant the 111 degree temperatures. The room was dark and cool in feel, a nice respite from the blaring heat outside. The bathroom included a 6 foot, fairly deep soaking tub and a tile enclosed shower. One note of improvement might be the bath towels that should probably include a bath sheet, but everything else, from the robes to the beautifully scented amenities, from the flat screen TV to the extensive magazine selection, the free wireless Internet and the luxurious linens, made for a comfortable, serene several nights of meetings. TCooks was great, too, although we only had breakfast there! Still, the superstars to me were the grounds and the staff. People like James, the minibar attendant that escorted us to the dining room when we were wandering, a bit lost, in our exploration of the hotel or Adam, the bell person who checked us out and noticed the computer bag, thoughtfully storing it in the bell closet to keep the equipment cool.

There was always a fresh of cold ice water at my side without even having to ask. The small ( and I stress small) areas for improvement are that they really need an adults only pool since the current pool area had quite a few noisy children. I do not understand what causes parents to bring young children to a romantic resort like this but there were times when their screaching and splashing in the pool took away from what otherwise would have been a positively idyllic experience. There were a couple well-behaved children but there were also some over whom their parents exercised less control. I think that this hotel advertises itself more as an adult-style couples' property than a family resort but it seemed to be more of an family property. A simple solution would be to place an adults only pool area in the Montecito Terrace courtyard, where the fountain now is. The other area for improvement is in the food. We had dinner in the restaurant on the property. The dining room is beautiful but the cuisine did not quite measure up to the beauty of the dining room.

We just spent the past Easter weekend at the Royal Palms Resort and Spa in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. It was the perfect small resort for our last minute romantic get away. It was the first time we have been to the Royal Palms and there were quite a few room style choices. We went with a package featured on their website that included a third night free when you booked two nights. The package also included $50 toward food and beverage in T. Cooks (their fine dining restaurant) and $50 toward spa services. We upgraded for an additional $10/night to be in the \"Designer Casita.\" We were in \"Casita\" 116 which isn't really a casita as it is attached on both sides to another casita but the room was very private and it had its own front patio and was situated in a cul-de-sac of casitas. There was some street traffic noise from E. Camelback Road as these rooms are in the front of the hotel but once inside the room, we didn't hear the traffic once. The room was very tastefully decorated in a Mediterranean/colonial style. It was painted in a rich dark color which we found cozy but someone else might find oppressive. There was a gas fireplace (with remote.) The flat screen TV was in an armoire and was a bit small for the distance it was from the bed but there were two very comfortable chairs at the end of the bed which worked well for viewing. The room had a nice size desk, a large closet and ample drawer space. The four poster king bed was very comfortable with nice linens. There was turn down service each night. The bathroom had a large walk in shower with a skylight and a separate standard tub. The amenites were lovely. I couldn't get enough of the orange blossom scented moisturizer. (I bought a large bottle at the spa to take home.) The resort is very atmospheric and the grounds are lovely with flowering plants, meandering walkways. and pools and fountains. You really feel like you have gotten away. The swimming pool area is small and the lounge chairs would fill up each day but the staff was very accomodating setting up more seating as needed, refreshing used towels, providing ice water, adjusting umbrellas and serving light food. The pool water wasn't heated and it was too cold for me to enjoy at this time of year but my husband braved it and enjoyed floating on the \"rafts\" provided. The fish tacos at the Cabana Cafe were excellent. We ordered room service a number of times and were quite impressed. In room dining is one of the most difficult services for a hotel to get right but the Royal Palms didn't disappoint. They were extremely timely and efficient. They accomodated all of our little requests for things off the menu (peanut butter for my husband's toast, cottage cheese for me.) Kudos to server/manager Todd for a great job/department. (If I had one suggestion, it would be to warm the breakfast bakeries but that is a small fine point.) We enjoyed our two dinners at T. Cooks restaurant. (A little disappointed with the desserts but the ice cream and sorbet were worth the calories.) Sunday through Thursday they were offering three courses for $50 which was a good deal. We would highly recommend the roasted chicken, the salmon and the duck. One night we had dinner in the lounge. We shared a wonderful burger with a nice salad the night we arrived. There was live music and a great relaxed vibe. Kim, our waitress, was very thoughtful to have the kitchen split our meal onto two plates and load up on the greens. We used the small but adequate work out room. The equipment was new (three treadmills with built-in TVs - head phones provided, I-pod adaptable, three oscillators) and there was a set of free weights, a small area for mat work and some yoga and \"ball\" equipment. I got lucky and didn't have to wait for a machine but I could imagine a line up. There was a hot tub by the pool which I didn't use because I over-heard the temperature was rather low. We did have massages in the new spa which was very nice. I am sorry that I forget the therapist's name because I would recomment her. My husband was pleased enough with his treatment too. Again there was a worthwhile package that included dinner for two in the restaurant when you booked two massages. Another deal Sunday through Thursday was a ninety minute massage for the price of sixty minutes. Not bad! The spa facility is new. It is small but thoughtfully designed with separate lounging areas (indoors and out) hottubs and steam rooms. The resort is showing some wear around the edges (i.e. lounge chair cushions, awnings in the cabana cafe) but the staff''s eargerness to please and atttention to detail make up for anything that isn't sparkling. The \"resort fee\" of $25/day was a little confusing. As I understand it takes care of housekeeping and valet but not any food and beverage service or pool attendants. Obviously we were very pleased with our first stay and plan to return. With the special packages, we felt we got a fair value. I think we got lucky because of these deals and am not sure what next year will bring. (We wouldn't return this year because I couldn't stand the intense heat later this spring/summer.) I understand these prices aren't usual. - All in all, it was just what the doctor ordered even though it did pour rain on Saturday and it was suggested that we had brought it with us...", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, IL", "Title": "\u201cBest service I've ever had\u201d", "Author": "zipandlucy", "ReviewID": "UR27585762", "Content": "My girlfriends and I just spent a wonderful weekend here, and we didn't have a single complaint.

We arrived when the citrus trees in Scottsdale were blooming and the smell of orange blossoms just filled the air everywhere you went..at the RP's they have so many blooming trees it was like a botanical garden. When we checked in we were upgraded to one of the Monte Vista rooms and I think we got the best one! On the top floor facing Camelback Mountain and the pool and our room had two terraces.. We had room service one morning on one of them and it was so relaxing and the food was good. One thing I noticed about the room service is that is was less expensive than the other two resorts I mentioned and better food and service. The first night we were there we sat outside of T Cooks on one of the tables surrounding the fountain.. Beautiful night and weather and big candles at each table. We just had cocktails and lots of appetizers..very romantic setting.. On our second night we ate at T Cooks indoors and had one of the best meals ever.. One of the days we went out to the pool before noon, and I do suggest if you are planning on enjoying the pool area get there around that time as it gets very crowded. I liked how the minute I sat down a pool attendant came rushing up with a glass of iced water with lemon, and continued to refill every time it got empty.. It wasn't a very hot day to Arizona's standards but toasty enough to have to take a swim in the non-heated pool to cool off. Yes, the pool is not heated and it's oh so cold when you first get in, but I bet when the weather is 100+ it's a relief.

After much research, we settled on the Royal Palms. We were not disappointed. On arrival, the valet staff were cheery and helpful, even offering to run small errands for us, such as a trip to the corner store, etc. The check-in process was smooth and the gentleman helping us with our bags was well informed about the resort's features, history, and amenities. The property is lush and well planted - a tropical oasis in the middle of the dessert. Beautiful. The rooms were clean, warm and inviting. The view of Camelback Mountain from our room was very romantic. The housekeeping staff were very thorough and the nightly turn-down service was a nice touch. I was suffering from a cold so we decided to stay in one evening. My wife ordered room service and when the wait staff arrived and noticed the cough syrup on the table, he showed genuine concern, explaining that the Royal Palms took illness very seriously and he would be happy to have the chef prepare some chicken soup and a hot toddy. Caring and attentive service was found throughout the property, with the pool attendants offering the best service. They were always ready to fill a drink, bring a glass of water, find a chair, refresh towels, etc. The pool bar closes a little early (6pm?) but the pool and hot-tub remain open all night. Great relief from the heat. The pool area was basically adults only. There was an occassional kid, but I got the impression children weren't encouraged. In fact, I overheard one of the valet's radio the pool attendant to let him know that \"Shamu\" had arrived (a family with an inflatable whale). They put a stop to that and we never did see Shamu or the kids. The restaurant was exceptionally good, although I did have one negative experience when I chose to sit outside to eat. We sat for about ten minutes and never did see any wait staff, even though the maitre'd assured us there was service on the patio. To be fair, it was very hot and nobody in their right mind would want to be outside and I was sick and didn't wait very long before leaving to head to our room. The lounge, adjacent to the restaurant had a great selection of drinks, a funky vibe, and great entertainment. It was hard to find a seat, but once seated the service was very attentive. My wife and I both had spa treatments while we were there. The spa was nothing spectacular, but very comfortable. Noticing I had a terrible cough, the masseuse even took the time to call me the next day to give me the name of a cough syrup his doctor had recommended to him. I noticed that some travellers complained about the $22 per day resort fee. This fee includes valet parking and all tips. It is a bargain - you would spend that much on valet in most hotels. Speaking of valet, if you call ahead before leaving your room, the valets will have your car ready and waiting with the air conditioner on.

Really, the privacy, service, atmosphere and detail are more along the lines of a top notch b&b than a hotel. Valet parking is included with your stay, which is very nice.

The rooms are a decent size and beautifully decorated with particularly nice bathrooms which have deep oval soaking tubs and separate shower cubicles. There is even a 'window (no glass, just an opening with shutters to close if you want privacy) cut into the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom which is a nice touch. The Estate rooms are basically the same, and in the same building, but don't have a patio or balcony and lack the view. The only downside is the smallish pool area. The pool is beautiful, the sunloungers very comfortable and the service great, but the pool area and the pool itself are quite small and so both can feel crowded and noisy if the hotel is busy.

After a lot of research of Phoenix and Scottsdale resorts, we choose Royal Palms mainly because it is more exclusive and smaller than the large resorts (the Phoenician is a couple of streets over). Especially after learning that it was spring break and many hotels were close to being 100% booked, I definitely didn't want to go to a place that was so booked that I would have to wait for everything, pool, gym, breakfast, valet. The Royal Palms makes you feel like you are among very few people and have alot of privacy. They have a very nice pool (just 1) and the staff throughout the hotels is very attentive and nice. The valet and bellmen are just wonderful, we never had to wait long to pick up or drop off our car. The front desk even printed out our boarding passes the day before we left, which we are so grateful of after seeing the enormous lines at the airport. We may have been late for the flight, in which case my husband would have yelled at me for since I am always running late! This is the kind of place for someone looking for privacy and doesn't care about having 3 pools and many loung bars through the hotel. It is a smaller hotel but that really is the beauty of it. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with camelback mountain in the back drop. The hotel itself is mediteranean style with beautiful antique pieces throughout.

The blond guy (I'm bad with names) was like a walking hand-book in steps of service. Flawless in other words. I do love the accomodating approach, one that he def. mastered (which could not be said for his sidekick). In 104 degrees heat, one would be dependent on the pool no?! I guess the different flavoured Pina Coladas didn't hurt either. The second wow-factor was owed to the food. Top notch, roomservice as well as in the restaurant (same kitchen, but that doesn't nec. guarantee anything). In particular we were hooked on some of the breakfast items, so much that we squeezed one in before our checking out, a last one... Other than that the grounds were very pretty. Ordinarily we would stay at smaller capacity hotels, not used to sharing lol. The first room we were offered must have been on top of a flight hangar, or the back of the restaurant turbines, same thing. But that was corrected immediately. We had booked a Designer Casita, which turned out to be quite spacious, with a sturdy bed. My only complaint was the standard of the bathroom. We had been warned at the time of booking that it would be a \"standard\" bathroom, but for the room level I don't think I've had such a basic bathroom ever. Leaves room for improvement.

The room was beautiful with a super comfy king bed, a desk with 2 chairs, a leather lounger with ottoman, french doors to terrace, a huge bathroom with a big, deep soaking tub and shutters that looked out towards the courtyard. The rooms was as one would expect - super clean, triple sheeted, lots of towels, wonderful smelling bath amenities, separate galss walled shower, tile floors, magnifying mirror with light and everything squeaky clean and sparkling.

These were expensive, but there was room in the fridge to store the beverages we brought from home [I asked to be sure that I could safely take things out without setting off some kind of measuring system and was assured that it would be ok. I should mention at this point that the hotel charges $22 a day \"all tips\" fee. We really liked the concept of not having to tip every person for everything they did for us. The only thing it didn't cover was food and spa service gratuity. Valet parking was included and it was nice not having to tip everytime we took the vehicle out or brought it back in.

The service was impeccable. From the valet and bell hop who first greeted us -- to the cabana caf\u00e9 staff, the spa attendants, and the restaurant staff -- everyone was friendly, helpful and really seemed to take immense pride in working at the Royal Palms.

When we got back to our room after dinner, DH had surprised me with a Rose Petal turndown service! It was beautiful. The hotel does twice daily room service and in the evening, the turndown service included chocolates, a poem, a CD with soothing music on, little bottles of water on each bedside table and robes folded and placed on the corners of bed. In looking over the Monthly Event Calendar, we found that they offered complimentary cooking classes on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. We arrived too late for the Wednesday class [the executive chef taught how to make their famous pesto and pomodoro sauce. The class we went to was done by the executive pastry chef.

Although the grounds are very beautiful, the rooms are romantic, and T. Cook's Restaurant and Lounge, and the service by the pool are all extraordinary, the business end of the hotel leaves QUITE A BIT TO BE DESIRED! When we arrived, our room was not ready and the person at the check-in desk said he would call within the hour to let us know what the status of our check in would be. When we had not received a phone call more than two hours later, we stopped by the front desk. The person did not seem to remember us, but another person at the desk asked if our phone number was on file and said that she would call. The second Royal Palms representative did call, and we ended up checking in about 3:30 pm (which is a 1/2 hour before the scheduled check-in time --even though I sent a request asking about an early check-in since I knew that we would be arriving around 10 am). Although we understand that our room was not ready early, I would have appreciated the call that the first representative said that he was going to make so that we could have made a better use of our afternoon. I was surprised that the room did not have a fireplace. I had called the property to inquire about fireplaces in the Deluxe Casitas (where we were booked), and was told that those rooms did have fireplaces; yet, we were placed in a room without one. The room was cozy, but I was looking forward to this particular amenity. On the second night of our stay, we had to call housekeeping to receive turn down service and request to have our towels changed. My biggest problem with the Royal Palms was the check-out/billing procedure. First, my minor issue. I had asked for our boarding passes to be printed (since that is a service that the Royal Palms offers), but the person at the front desk did not remember to give them to me until I asked. OK, a little oversight, but coupled with what followed, it just made the \"little\" oversight magnified. My major issue has to do with billing. First we were given the wrong bill (with someone who was charged about half what we paid per night for lodging). Then we were given our bill with three nights' charges for Rose Petal Turndown Service when we only had that service the first night. The Royal Palms check-out representative then deducted the subsequent two nights and informed us that we would receive an updated e-mail version of our bill before we were charged. I did not receive the e-mail version of the bill, but my credit card was charged for the total of the invoice I received upon departure and an additional amount. After calling the resort several times to speak with someone in accounting, I left a message asking someone to send me an updated (and corrected invoice with an explanation of any additional charges). When I received the e-mail with an updated copy of my bill there was ANOTHER FRAUDULENT CHARGE! I spoke with someone after receiving that invoice and she seemed a bit annoyed with my inquiries and requests to have the charges explained and removed. Finally, there were so many events being hosted at the Royal Palms (at least one every day of our visit), that the staff often seemed pulled away from their lodging guests. It seemed that during our stay there was not sufficient staff to address the needs of ALL guests, those lodging at the property and those hosting special events. For a property of this size, requesting what the Royal Palms requests per night for lodging, service should be seamless and all guests should feel like they are VERY special. We are not picky guests, if it were not for the abovementioned snafus, we would have never interacted with the Royal Palms staff since I had arranged all of our activities and dining options prior to arrival. In the event that the service is not seamless and the guests are not made to feel extra special, the property management should follow-up with guests to the best of their ability to explain the situation and offer some sort of compensation. I have traveled extensively for business and pleasure, and have stayed in large and small hotels where the management generally seemed to be concerned with the well-being of the guests.

As many satisfied guests have noted, the property is initimate, well-groomed, historic, romantic (part of its schtick is to promote romance), and an utterly refreshing change from the mega resorts like the Biltmore and Phoenician which are nearby on Camelback. These are high points, along with the good service and friendly staff. However, we thought it didn't quite live up to our expectations. And, frankly, I'm a bit surprised at the surfeit of \"5s\" in the tripadvisor ratings. The Royal Palms is good...but that good? We had a designer casita room which we thought was a bit dark and maybe a bit too in-your-face with a romantic furnishing (to be fair, this is the theme of the place). The bathtub in our room was mundane. Just a tub. But it had a huge walk in shower (with only one head). Far better, we thought, if the tub were a two-person jacuzzi tub and the shower more routine (to stick with the romance theme). The room had two patios, but the back patio was small, the walls were high, there was no planting or other vegetation. It was quite claustophobic. And the larger front patio -- where we did sit and eat breakfast one morning -- was not especially private. People could walk right by, within feet of our table (there were curtains we could pull across...but that just made it less scenic). Our room also was noisy. The AC was noisy, but most of all there was a constant running of water, like a toilet or shower was running next door. Maybe it was unique to this room -- Room 105 -- because we were at the end of a row of casitas and near the kitchen (could it have been kitchen plumbing?). Overall, the room seemed very nice and pretty but not luxurious by any means. Incidentally, these designer casitas are on the west side of the property and a bit isolated from the other rooms and casitas. You should ask to be on the east side -- you'll be closer to the pool and spa too. Finally, to our minds, one drawback was the lack of public rooms. Yes, I know, this is a boutique kind of establishment and I guess the expectation is that guests will walk the grounds or hole up in their rooms, but a couple of indoor public spaces would have been nice. The lobby here is not big -- just a check-in area. And when it's 110 outside, the outside sitting areas are not always comfortable. Call me a nitpicker, but it wasn't a perfect 5, at least if judged against other properties that try to reach the same customer base and at the same price range.

Turns out they overbooked so they gave us a higher end room. My wife and I rarely complain but in this situation I was upset that they didn't tell me this up front. I looked out our lone window and saw a fence and whatever business is next door and their vehicles. Could not see CamelBack.

The menu for the buffet and branch was sort of difficult to understand this system. It does not state clearly what these prices include. The buffet was excellent. I was already full with the meal so I didn't a room to taste all the deserts unfortunately. There were several kind of deserts, which looked refined. I ate only one desert, which was a rapsberry square cake. It was a small one in a big plate. It had a tangy strong rapsberry taste and I personally liked it much. The buffet was so beautiful that I feel like going back to Phoenix only for that. The steam room and juccuzi bath were located in Alvadora spa, but they were free to use anytime from 8am - 8pm. They will give you a locker room key. Parking was all convenient vallet parking. Only downsizing was that I had several mosquito bites in the room and outside of the room.

I haven't seen a casita or a suite--I've only stayed in a regular room here. I stayed in a room in the 200's on this trip. The room was fine, especially the bath, which is opulent and wonderful. The closet in the room is small, and there's no real dresser drawers. There's coffee in the room--French press style, which is great--and a fridge that doesn't charge you if you accidently pick up an item. The rooms are a little dark, but you can fully open the blinds for more light. The only thing that perplexed me on this stay was the refilling of the mini-fridge and the coffee. They give you enough in-room coffee for one use--but I was there for almost 3 days. I figured the maid service would replenish it, but no. So I called the front desk, and someone brings me a bunch of loose coffee in a drinking glass with plastic over it.???? Also, I drank all the bottled water in the mini-fridge the first day, but it was never replenished. Again, I called to request it be replenished, and they brought me some huge glass bottles of Evian from the restaurant.??? Also, my room did have a small ant problem, over by the chairs. I got bit on the toe by one, and now the itching is driving me crazy. But when you are in Phoenix, these things happen. Overall, I would stay here again, most definitely.

The first night we ordered a taxi and a limo pullled up, we thought it was complimentary-nice. It wasn't . Although a little more expensive than a taxi (depending on the driver) we felt a bit ripped off.Turns out we couldn't get a taxi from the hotel without waiting almost 30-40 mins so we had to use the limo service (who were always at the hotel and always charged a diferent price) for the w/end.

At over $400 per night, you don't really want to live \"out of your suitcase\", but Royal Palm provides no dresser, no chest of drawers, only two small one drawer nightstand, and no hooks or towel rack in the bathrooms. (Your towels are \"rolled\" and place on the counter.) No hook anywhere for your wet bathing suit or PJ's, or whatever you are wearing while in the bathroom. Just the cold marble floor! The good news on my last visit (4/07) was that we were upgraded to a small suite, the bad news is that it must have been a handicap-only room as the bar in the only closet in the space was lowered for wheelchair access. (Room 313, if my memory serves me correctly.) So, no \"long hang\" ability for the ladies. I don't remember if that was the problem in 4/06, but I do remember our room also had no convenient place to put your clothing. My wife had to hang her \"fancy\" dress on a the drapery rod.

We were looking for a nice, relaxing place where we could spend time together (we live in 3 different states across the country from each other). The resort is absolutely beautiful, the rooms are outstanding, and the spa was beyond words. We were told at check-in that the resort was fully committed, yet we felt almost as if we were the only ones there! Our casita consisted of a living room, bedroom and large bathroom - more than enough room for the 3 of us to comfortably relax. We also had a patio that overlooked a lovely courtyard area that had a fountain and several wood fireplace pits. They were lit on Friday night but not the others, which was a little disappointing. However, I'm sure that had we asked to have them lit, it would have been done right away!! We ate dinner outside of the resort 2 evenings but did enjoy T. Cook's on Saturday night. Overall, it was lovely but the service could have been better. We did feel as if the waitress could have been friendlier and more involved in our dining experience (as opposed to just serving us food). The fitness center and spa were excellent. I enjoyed two treatments at the spa and they were phenomenal - worth every penny. I would like to comment on one event that happened during our stay that explains why the Royal Palms is \"royal\" in my book....during her massage, my mother and her massage therapist were talking about where we had eaten the night prior and my mom commented that we had eaten at T. Cook's. She asked my mom what she had for dinner and my mom told her the duck. She asked her if she enjoyed it and my mom said yes, but that it had been a little dry. They went on to discuss other things and my mom didn't think anything of the conversation. When we all got back to the room, we received a call from the front desk advising us that the duck was going to be removed from bill!! What a surprise, especially when it's not expected. It's things like this that make you feel like you are a guest that is truly cared about. All in all, the Royal Palms is the nicest place I have ever stayed. It is not really for children and it's not for the die hard partier looking for night life entertainment.

I had researched many resorts and had narrowed my choices to the Lake Austin Spa Resort and the Royal Palms. The Royal Palms was clearly a more interesting destination with options outside of the resort that were endless, so I chose it. I booked through Expedia and while the RP was either the most expensive or 2nd most expensive choice in the PHX/Scottsdale area, it seemed to be the best fit. The descriptions on this site and at the RP website indicated it's small and personal feel and service, which was appealing. The website won me over with the awards list and the beautiful photos, especially those showing it's proximity to Camelback Mtn. I booked the package (air and hotel) well in advance- at least 4 months and figured I would begin making spa, restaurant and excursion reservations about one month out. Long story short, it is very important to call in advance (as soon as you book would be best) in order to get your preferred times to dine at T. Cooks for dinner (breakfast and lunch res. not required) and especially at the spa. The times I had asked for intitially were unavailable, even one month in advance. Also, when you speak to someone, take their name and then call again a few weeks before your trip to confirm your appts. It was all worked out before we arrived and we were welcomed with fabulous service, but I felt like most of that was due to my frequent contact beforehand. Be sure plan ahead if you stay at the RP...your trip will only be worth the expense if you plan each detail so as not to miss out on all of the opportunities and inclusions in staying here. The only reasons I did not give this resort a full 5 are: Although the resort does not claim to be adults only, all of the reviews and even the RP website alludes to this. We were there during a insurance broker's conference and many brokers had brought their children with them. While this was only a minor issue, it is worth noting that at a resort with a pool area that is so intimate, children's voices (even joyful ones) carry and tend to interfere slightly with the romantic and peaceful atmosphere. Even when you book ahead of time, the charges in the spa are a) never the same as what you saw online or were quoted and b) always seemingly random (literally as if the numbers were simply drawn from a lottery) and WAY over-priced. Check your bill carefully. If you speak to someone in charge, they will correct the bill, but it will be time consuming. The spa is fabulous and while I am willing to pay $500 a night for a room, paying more than $150 for a very standard 60 minute massage is ridiculous. Thinking that I would have been disappointed with only one day at the spa, I booked two mornings full of spa activities and services on the 2nd and 4th days of our stay. If I could do it all over again, I would simply ask for the 90 minute massage (confirm the price in writing ahead of time) and leave the spa treatments to that. This was worth every penny. The 60 minute massage and manicure were overpriced and not nearly relaxing or enjoyable enough to justify the price. I found myself anxious the entire time I should have been enjoying these treatments b/c I knew that I was spending hundreds of dollars on something that had less than $100 of value to me. On the last day we stayed, a motley crew of people that looked as if they belonged in a trashy music video took over the pool. They ordered grey goose and champagne as if it were going out of style (beginning before noon) and played their loud music and smoked their cigarettes while dancing their scantily clad bodies around the pool. They even brought their yapper of a dog to run around wildly and bother the guests. While these folks obviously had paid (on credit no doubt) for the two cabanas they inhabited it didn't matter b/c the size of the pool and area were only modestly larger than a large residential pool. Please also keep in mind that the past few days (while many children had been present) were quite peaceful and the pool had only been visited by folks with similar interests (sunbathing, having maybe 1 or 2 drinks and lunch and enjoyng the peaceful and romantic atmosphere). While Rick was fab. by asking them to keep quiet and not physically invade the other guest's space, there was nothing he could do but keep bringing them their drinks and grin and bear it. Needless to say, we did not stay at the pool more than 5 minutes on our last day, which was disappointing. I am not sure how the RP could have prevented this occurance, but I am shocked that \"those\" sorts of people chose the RP for their party. It certainly was not a good match! THANKS are deserved! The special touches at the RP are what makes it worth the cost. While you could stay at the Bellagio for less, no one there will remember your name, which pool chair you like or whether you prefer red or white. You certainly won't be receiving personally signed notes at the beginnning and end of your stay, nor rose petal covered bedding or chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise at turn-down. The staff was superb and especially gracious and friendly. The grounds are beautiful. The food and service are great. The suite is worth the extra $- having the extra room is great for couples with different sleeping habits. TIPS: Place a personal item on a pool chair early in the morning to get your preferred spot. (The sun is strong, so be sure to wear sunscreen at all times.) Be sure to go to Camelback Mtn. for a few hikes- the ones recommended in the brochure are great- for all levels. Sunset horsesback riding is highly recommended. While the crowd you'll be with for 4 hours isn't the classiest, the views are breathtaking. Go to arizona-horses for one option. Skip the shopping, especially if you live in a more metropolitan area. T. Cooks is as good as any restaurant off site, so if I had it to do again I would have dined there each evening I was interested in a more formal meal. For informal, do a steakhouse or cookout with the horseback riding and be sure to check out Pizza Bianco. The Bar Bianco and Pizza rest. are well worth the wait. It is such a cute set-up on a lovely evening. Also, you'll be right next to the stadium, so you can check that out, too. If you decide to rent a car (which you don't need to do unless you plan to leave the resort more than once per day), def. do the convertible.

So be our EIGHT YEAR run at the Royal Palms Resort in Phoenix. We thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year, 2006 but decided, why change something that has usually been good? Well, we found out why. The front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits. First, our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip...then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available, only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room, after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc. Then we were told no roll aways anymore...all of our previous visits we have had one. So this was an issue this year... new rule. That was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night. We were unable to have beds for all guests in our room, then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative. They offered The Ritz, which is not a Resort/Spa. We had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p.m. Friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the PHOENICIAN was a Pleasant one. WE have always had problems with the bills being incorrect at Royal Palms (we did for our one night too!) and the pool service, they had one nice guy at the RP taking care of the entire pool, when they knew they were entirely booked at their hotel.

When I was planning the trip, I had assumed that our future memories of this vacation would center around the majesty of the Grand Canyon and our unique closeness to it (We stayed at the Buckey O'Neill suite, the oldest standing structure in the Grand Canyon area). I was completely wrong. While the Grand Canyon was indeed majestic, our enjoyment of this national treasure paled greatly in comparison to our experience at the Royal Palms. I have stayed at a few 5-star hotels in the last few years, and was expecting similar exemplary service and fine dining. My expectations were greatly exceeded. The grounds are exquisite (there are many \"secret\" gardens waiting to be found, and while the hotel had no vacancies when we stayed, we almost always felt like we were the only guests), the spa was very high class, the rooms were beautifully decorated and modern (with a touch of old-world style with the four-poster beds), the food at T Cook's was excellent (room service was also provided by T Cook's), and the service was absolutely incredible. The last reviewer described service as lacking. He must have been staying at some Bizarro-world Royal Palms. Every hotel worker I passed greeted me with a smile and a hello (often congratulaing us on our honeymoon), restaurant service and room service were prompt, and when we checked out, they did express a desire to see us again (as if this really matters at all--boy, that last reviewer was picky!). But beyond this basic 5-star treatment, the service staff went above and beyond anything I had ever experienced before. One example: I bookended my trip with the Royal Palms (one night at the start of the trip and one night at the end, after the Grand Canyon). When we pulled into the Royal Palms picturesque driveway on the last night, not only were we greeted by name by the bellhops, but were shown immediately to our room, with no need to check-in. The Royal Palms, without my asking, has upgraded us to a villa (with two private courtyards) from a simple casita. In addition, by our bedside, they had given us an additional present (a CD of southwestern music) and a letter thanking us for choosing the Royal Palms for the first night of our honeymoon and for returning. They went out of their way to make my honeymoon special. This was extremely personalized service at its best. I used Trip Advisor, as well as Conde Nast (Royal Palms is on the Gold List) and Travel & Leisure (Rated as one of the Top 50 U.S. hotels and the top hotel in Phoenix/Scottsdale) to pick a Phoenix/Scottsdale resort. On Trip Advisor, while other resorts have similar overall ratings, if you compare the user reviews of the other five-star hotels to the Royal Palms, you'll notice that reviews for the Royal Palms are much more overwhelmingly positive.

Attendant in the spa showed me all the treatment rooms - they were unbelievable beautiful. So even if you don't use them ask to see them. Breakfast & Lunch at T.Cooks or Cabana Grille were superb. Only a little disappointed with Dinner at T.Cooks (service & decor were excellent but portions were very small and plain - also not much selection for vegetarians like us who eat fish, although not shellfish). But that is such a minor comment and will absolutely not deter us from visiting again. Treat yourself and stay at Royal Palms.", "Date": "October 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prairie Village, KS", "Title": "\u201cLike coming home only better...\u201d", "Author": "ChellePV", "ReviewID": "UR2570367", "Content": "We just returned from spending the past week at the Royal Palms and there simply aren't enough good things to be said about our visit. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an amazingly friendly, warm and caring staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our first contact was with Tony, one of the valet attendants, who opened our doors, introduced himself and thereafter, always knew us by name. (This was a trait of everyone we met on the property...it was as if we were staying with friends who always greeted us this way.) He took care of our luggage while we checked in and then gave us a tour of the property and then showed us to our room. We splurged on a deluxe casita and it was well worth it. The room was beautiful, but then again, what isn't beautiful at the Royal Palms? The only other place we have seen that was so completely visually appealing was a resort we stayed at in Tahiti. Obviously very different environments but beauty is beauty no matter where it's found. The entire property makes you feel like you are living in a lovely, watercolor painting. The colors of the buildings and flowers and artwork all make for a serene and soothing atmosphere which you find yourself melting into very quickly. The casita was beautifully decorated and very roomy. We had a private patio in the back with a view of Camelback Mountain. We had our own patio in the front as well (there are curtains you can let down to increase the feeling of privacy) where we sat and enjoyed the lovely evenings. The bathroom is a slice of heaven. The huge, walk-in shower with built-in, tiled seating is a spa treatment in itself. And the selection of soaps and lotions that are provided are wonderfully luxurious. We can't offer enough praise to everyone, and we mean literally EVERYONE, who works there. Everyone is so happy and I don't mean in a freakish Disney/Stepford way. It's as if everyone there is absolutely thrilled to be doing their jobs and in finding ways to make you feel content and welcome. We never heard a raised voice, saw a scowling face or felt as if we weren't the most important guests there. The food in the restaurants is wonderful if just a little pricey but then again, you're paying for unsurpassed quality and service. T. Cook's serves marvelous meals and the Cabana Grill has wonderfully casual lunches (and breakfast brunch on Sundays) and poolside drinks. The poolside service is unsurpassed and again, Rick and Jose (I can't say enough good things about the two of you either!!!) make you feel as if you're visiting their home. And by the joy they demonstrate when doing their jobs, it's no wonder you feel that way. We didn't use the spa but we visited the boutique area and it was beautiful as well and also well stocked with a wide assortment of spa products. On our last night there, we had the privilege of attending the General Manager's reception in the Presidential Villa (where President Bush had stayed just 2 weeks prior...regardless of your politics, it's pretty cool to know you're standing in the bedroom where a world leader has recently slept!). Our wonderful friend Jose was there and we also had the joy of meeting Greg Miller, the GM, Rick Behr, Delores (I hope I spelled your name correctly!) the Director of Experiences, and Gregory Casale, the head chef. They were all entertaining and charming and we had lovely drinks and hors d'oeuvres which made for a great send-off on our last night. We were truly sad to leave them, in fact when we left to go back to our casita, Jose made a point of stopping us and letting us know what a pleasure it had been to have us stay with them. It felt so much like saying good-bye to a friend that we hugged him before we left. My husband had seen the resort on Great Hotels on the Travel Channel but could not remember the exact name of the resort. Since we had never been to Phoenix before, that meant we had to search through every other high-end resort property before he recognized the Royal Palms from its pictures. Even after having looked at all those other properties, we just had a feeling about the Royal Palms and we couldn't have been happier to have made the choice we did. There will be no other place for us to stay on any future visits to Phoenix. Why would we? Coming back to the Royal Palms would be like coming home. And as a testament to the commitment to service and care the Royal Palms offers, look at the negative reviews of any of the other comparable resorts. Do you see any responses from those properties' management? No. And in the scant negative comments I've seen about the Royal Palms (both of which seemed to come from completely unreasonable people in my opinion), they took the time to respond and see if they could make things right. That says it all to me. This is the finest property in Phoenix, hands down. I don't need to stay anywhere else to know that. Thank you to everyone at the Royal Palms who made our stay with you an absolute joy.

This is a outstanding place for a romantic getaway or to go to relax, eat, enjoy the spa. T. Cooks restaurant was very good. Enjoy a margarita by the Kiva fireplace outside. Heaven. The casita is amazing with evening chocolates delivered to your door! I could go on. The entire staff from the valets to the maids to the pool bar staff is outstanding.

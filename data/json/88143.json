I booked the hotel online through their website a couple of months before we were to arrive. The problems started as soon as we got there. It wasn't the nicest looking place, but that wasn't to big of a deal since we were only staying for about six hours. When I went to check in at the front desk, no one was up there. I seen a reflection of some lady chowing down on some hot wings in the back. I waited patiently for about five minutes. Finally she noticed I was there. They had already assigned me a room. I asked what time the shuttle ran to the airport and she responded I was not booked for that package. I knew I was as I was very careful to make sure I did on their website. The lady was very quick to get rude. I could tell she was the kind of person that was looking for an arguement, so I told her it must of been my mistake, could she please help us out since we had traveled about 120 miles. It worked, so that was nice. Although, it shouldn't have been an issue since that is what I booked. The next issue was the room. Wow. It was very old, dated, and dirty. We left our luggage in the bathroom hoping that any bugs/bedbugs generally do not travel to those areas. The worst part was the rooms smell. That musty, foul, mildew type smell. With only six hours, it wasn't worth trying to get a new room. We needed what little time we had to catch a few z's. I would imagine most rooms were like this anyway. It would have been nice if we could have slept. This place is close to the airport, but there must be no sound insulation to deaden the noise. It litterly sounded like the planes were about to crash through the window. The final thing is the beds. Dear God. Please know that I am not making this up, I have slept on concrete this is more comfortable than their beds. I could take about laying in one position for about 10 minutes. After that I would just ache and have to turn. I would guess these are the original beds that have been in the hotel since it was built. On a positive note, the transportation was quick and on time. The ride back was a different story at 2 am when the driver was an hour late, but that is a different story. Overall, spend a few extra dollars and stay at a better hotel.

(Not sure why Days Inn was being called Days Hotel; also, see related Sleep Inn review.) Upon arrival at Sleep Inn we were told that we were being sent to Days Inn. When we arrived at Days Inn and I explained that I had reserved a motel (Sleep Inn) that was 2 miles from the track (walking distance) and that this motel was not 2 miles from the track, the response was that this was not their problem and that they had nothing to do with Sleep Inn. A few minutes later, staff told us that both motels have the same owner. We had also been told that a management/ownership change had occurred about a month ago. Then we were told that Days Inn was charging us nothing. I asked, \"Nothing at all?\" and was told that Sleep Inn would be charging us its rate instead. Found out after the fact that Sleep Inn's rates are higher than Days Inn's rates. I asked for the manager's/owner's name/business card and was told to come back in an hour when they were less busy. At 5 am, I was awakened by dripping and saw that water was leaking from the ceiling in the bathroom. Within a few minutes, the lights in the bathroom went out bcause of so much water. Went to the front desk and explained what happened. The front-desk person started telling me that this was not their fault and the owner did not know what shape the motel was in when it was bought. The owner's business problems did not interest me; I told the front desk we needed another room. First, she told me she had another room and then said she didn't. She made no further attempt to resolve anything. I replied that it was a safety hazard and that she needed to find a room now. Her response: \"Patience.\" She seemed to be inconvenienced. (The place was deserted at 5 am; I can't imagine what would be of higher priority.) I asked if there was a maintenance person. Response: \"In the morning.\" I told her I did not want my family to be electrocuted in our bathroom and that she needed to find a room now. Response: \"Patience.\" I kept insisting--actually, I threatened to call the police due to safety concerns--so she shuffled through a stack of papers and gave me the room of a \"no-show.\" We spent from 5 am to 6 am on race day moving our belongings to another room 3 floors below the first room. Second room was stinky, gave us headaches, smelled of mold or maybe cigarettes (it was a non-smoking room). Our first room had 2 double beds; second room had only one king bed--for 3 people. Both rooms had sloppy tile jobs in the bathroom; seemed to be a repair of some sort. Possibly due to a leak? Elevators were old, rickety, and finicky. Not much selection at the breakfast buffet. The milk ran out and was eventually refilled. Eggs were promised several times but did not arrive until we were almost finished eating. Around 8:45 am, one employee said she was going to cut off breakfast at 9 am, even though breakfast was supposed to run until 9:30. It appeared they were running out of food. We went to the front desk again and were told that someone would call us about our room problems. The employee, who called herself \"management,\" asked for the best phone number at which to reach me. I asked when someone was going to call. She responded that I was giving her a hard time and said she hoped I wouldn't give the owner as much of a hard time as I was giving her. I clarified that I could not give her a phone number until I knew when they would call because the number depended on which day they were calling. Then she started arguing with me. Every encounter with her was an argument. The employee from 5 am, who was there later that day, said that the leak occurred because the people in the room above us clogged up the drains, left the water on, and left the room. It was our turn to say, \"Not my problem.\" Every statement we made and every valid complaint we had was met with irritation and variations of responses such as, \"Not my problem,\" \"Don't take it out on me,\" or \"Later.\" Pardon me, I did not read the manual on how to voice a complaint so as not to offend the employees--when there is an emergency. The first response should have been profuse apologies. No apology of any sort was given until we were walking out the door to check in to another motel. That apology came from the only employee we encountered who had even a partial sense of responsibility. We stayed only one night out of three and only stayed that night because who can find a motel room in Indianapolis at 5 am on race day? As it was, we barely made it to the race in time and missed some pre-race activities. It is now 4 days later, and still no one has called us. Also, there was an outdoor pool, but the water was green. This motel is run-down, and the response from most of the staff to problems is that it is the customer's fault and the customer's problem. And if a safety hazard occurs, the customer has to be \"patient\" at 5 am in their pajamas in the lobby. \"In the morning\" is apparently when they address safety hazards.

Their free shuttle to & from the airport was timely & the drivers friendly. We did not use their breakfast as the timing didn't work out.

No bathroom fan, so made the second person's experience not so pleasant. Breakfast was free, but started too late for my friend to eat there.

Because our flight was leaving at 8AM on January 28th, we decided to stay the night at a hotel near the airport and do \"Park & Fly\" for the week that we were gone. I had called on January 26th to make a reservation at Days Inn for the following night. At the time I asked about the Park & Fly rate and was told that they offered 7 nights free parking with one nights stay. I was given a total of $96.43 (including taxes and fees) for one non-smoking room with two double beds, two adults and one child, and were guaranteed late arrival. We arrived at Days Inn at 11PM on January 27, 2006. My son was asleep in the back seat, so I went in alone to check-in and my husband stayed in the van. When I gave the clerk at the desk my name, he said that they didn't have a reservation for me. I gave him the confirmation number and he said that they had me in the system for the 26th, not the 27th. I told him that there was a mistake on their part and asked if they had a room for us that night. The clerk said they did but he would have to charge me an additional $25 to leave our vehicle there for 7 nights. I asked about the free parking with one nights stay, and he said that we weren't booked with the Park & Fly rate. The Park & Fly rate evidently costs more, so in the end the parking really isn't free. Because it was so late and we were all so tired, I didn't really have a choice. So I paid the additional money and finished checking in. When I went back out to the van to unload our luggage and get the rest of my family, I found my husband standing outside of our van with an upset look on his face. He said that while I was inside, a Days Inn shuttle bus had hit our van with my husband and son IN it. The driver's name was Mary and she didn't seem to be bothered with what had just happened. She said that she tried to squeeze between our van and the curb, but there just wasn't enough room. My first concern was that my husband and son were okay. They were shaken up but seemed unharmed. I then looked at the incredible damage down the side of my van, and then went back in to talk to the front desk. By now the man that had been helping me was gone and a lady was there. I told her what happened and she got on the phone and called he General Manager, Dennis Anderson, at home. He said that all of the insurance information was locked in his office and no one else had a key. I asked why the insurance information was not in the shuttle bus, but he had no answer. He said that he would get me a copy of everything in the morning. I told him that we were leaving at 6AM the next morning to catch our flight, and asked if he would be in that early. He said no, but he would make a copy of everything for me and leave it at the front desk for me to pick-up when we got back on February 3. I said okay, but that I was going to call the police so that there would be a report on file. The girl at the desk told me that calling the police wasn't really necessary. I stood my ground and told her that at the very least, my insurance company would want a police report. So she called 911 and asked for a Sheriff to come out. The Sheriff got there within 30 minutes and took a report. I overheard Mary, the bus driver, telling him that she didn't do the damage to the front of my van - only the damage to the back. I immediately jumped in and asked her how on earth she believed that she didn't do ALL of the damage? She said she didn't know, but just knew that she didn't do it all. I'm not sure if she was saying that because she was scared of losing her job, or what. So, I decided that arguing with her was pointless and went back in to speak with the lady at the front desk to order a wake-up call for 5AM the next day. I mentioned to her that it would be very hospitable for the hotel to comp part if not all of our room cost, since the accident had caused us a LOT of inconvenience. She told me that she was already working on it with her manager, and that she felt bad about what happened. The next morning I went to the front desk, and the same lady told me that her Manager told her that we could take it up any comps with their insurance company. If they think we deserve anything extra we can get it from them. ?!?!? My mouth dropped open and I told her that I was blown away by that comment. I didn't have time to say much else because we had to leave for the airport. When we got back on February 3rd, it was again late at night. The same lady was at the front desk that was there when we checked in. I asked her for the envelope that was supposed to be left with me with their insurance company information enclosed. She said that Dennis must have forgotten to leave it because there wasn't anything there for me. She called him again at home, and he told her to tell me that the insurance company is Fireman's Fund, and gave me the toll free number. He told her to tell me that he would call us at home the next day with more detailed information. At that point I asked her what Mr. Anderson's boss's name is because I was going report this whole situation to the Days Inn Corporate Office and to his superior. The lady at the desk then told me that Mr. Anderson doesn't really have a superior for me to contact. I then told her that at the very least I would be contacting the Days Inn Corporate office with my complaint. Today is February 15, 2006, and my van is still not fixed. I have been communicating with Fireman's Fund Insurance since we got back, and they are disputing that their driver caused all of the damage. An investigation is under way and I should hopefully have resolution by tomorrow at the latest. I guarantee that if ALL of the damage done to my van by the shuttle bus doesn't get repaired, I will turn everything over to my attorney and we can take this to court. This has got to me the most blatant example of awful customer service that I have ever experienced in my life! My husband and I travel quite a bit and have always trusted Days Inn as a quality place to stay. Now I have serious doubts about ever using Days Inn again.

First of all, the hotel is located very convienently near the airport. When we checked in, it was very fast! Also, the front desk even printed out our boarding passes for Southwest! I called other hotels and they did not do that! Very pleased with this hotel! The rooms were ok, like any other hotel room. It was very clean, the showers were very nice as well! Again, no problem. They did have an outside pool but we were there so late and had to get up so early! This hotel even offers complimentary breakfast starting at 7:00am. We had to be gone by 6:00a so we didn't get to eat there. Checking out was just as fast as checking in! After we checked out, we just walked outside and waited about 10 minutes and boom there was a shuttle there waiting to take us to the airport! When we returned home, we just went to Ground Transportation, Hotel/Motel Pick up and called the Hotel and they were there to pick us up in 10 minutes on the shuttle! Luckily, we did the Park, Stay and Fly because when we got back to our car, our car would not start!!!! So a Hotel Staff Member helped us out with this as well!

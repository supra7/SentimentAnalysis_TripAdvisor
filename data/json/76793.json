The ice machine was located just down the walkway, in a covered, concession machine corner, and operated with e-z insert of our room card-key. The hotel-structure itself shielded our row of rooms from Colorado street by the hotel's wrap-around harbor design; it all made for a very cozy stay! and in a completely safe & comfortable setting. The Wal-Greens & CVS Drug Stores were just a block-walk away, and surrounded by plenty of sidewalk eateries and village-like sandwich shops. Even more: There's a public computer lab located along Colorado Street, in the \"village;\" The lab is frequented by local 'gamers,' but it's open to any patron who is willing to pay $10 for the first 3 ours, then $2 per hour thereafter. color-printed copies are available for .25 cents, and retrievable from the young attendant behind the help-desk. Finally, by the end of our stay, we simply did not want to leave this cozy, cute little hotel; and same can be said for the charming, quaint sidewalk \"village\" of Eagle Rock. We loved our stay in this lovely residential area and we would recommend this Choice Privileges location to any Quality cardholders.

This hotel was rated with 3 Stars and was reasonably priced for our budget so we booked three nights. The photos on line look great, really super, makes the place look brand new, (which it is not). Photos show giant rooms, (there were some that size in the photos), again, in the photos, everything is new looking, perfect, wonderful, a real paradise. Well some of those large room photos appear to be a couple of the remodeled rooms but still with the old furniture. While we were there, they were remodeling some other rooms. However, we had one of the old smaller rooms, not yet remodeled. In the case of the expression, \"A picture is worth a thousand words\", it does not hold true here. Our room was very small. The pictures on line make this place look like paradise and that we will tell you it is not. We were so disappointed when we arrived late in the evening and went to our room. Lets just go through our disappointment item by item: Clerk did fine checking us in, gave us an extra discount for a coupon we had picked up while on the road. As noted, the room was very small with very old, dated furniture. After we checked out, I took a few moments and looked at a larger, remodeled room, which just looked like fresh paint with the same old furniture and they had done some bathroom work. In our \"old room\" there was a table and two chairs, again, the funiture in the remodeled rooms looked the same as our, old but it may have been new and they just got the same ugly furniture style for the remodeled rooms. In our room, the chair seats cushions were so badly stained that we wouldn't sit on them. Many different large and small ugly stains all over them and the wood chair arms were sticky to the touch. Refrigerator had to be un-plugged because it was so loud when it came on. Tub, sink, toilet appeared clean but with the chairs experience and the feel of the carpeting as you walked on it with all its stains, we didn't know for sure how sink, etc were. By the way, the bathroom with tub and toilet is so small that you can use both at the same time. Do the vacuums they use in hotels have attachments??? All along the walls where carpeting meets the walls, about an inch out from the walls there was dirt, dust and crumbs in that groove and out as much as an inch out. It was indicated that they had new matresses which we saw had full matress covers on them so the new matresses seemed true, however, they were hard as rocks. It was like sleeping on a piece of plywood, no give at all and I'm over 225 lbs. Beds also had strange smaller, what we would call half pillows, so if you want to stay here, you may want to bring your own pillows, if you are comfortable putting them on these beds. Hotel is next to main street but we will say it was quiet in that respect, only one of the couple of pluses we could give this place. Lots of noise in the parking lot from the neighbors. Breakfast area is so small and tight to move in that is it really un-comfortable to eat at with 3 or 4 people in the area. We were so un-comfortable at the place that we checked out after one night and went else where for our other two nights in the area. We would not of rated this place with any stars at this time. If the hotel were to send a free night stay or even a weeks free stay because of our disapointment with our stay, we wouldn't use it or pass it on. We moved onto a Holiday Inn for $20 more a night, which was well worth it.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cMotel was near attractions and the staff was helpful.\u201d", "Author": "vacation1224", "ReviewID": "UR86252882", "Content": "Hotel was clean and affordable. it was near a few of the attractions that we wanted to see and the location was perfect for us.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oceanside, California", "Title": "\u201cNice quite room\u201d", "Author": "Muralman", "ReviewID": "UR85600166", "Content": "Room king room was large with desk, table, refrigerator& microwave.

The beds and pillows were comfortable (on the firm side which we prefer). The air conditioner was not on when we came in (and our visit was during a heat wave) but the room cooled down very quickly. TV worked fine. We were in the back corner, second floor and did not hear much noise. Stayed here for just one night so did not make use of the pool, business center or the free high speed internet, so can't comment on any of that, nor on the front desk service which was straight-forward check-in and check-out. I walked a block away to a Walgreens and also noticed there was a Starbucks, Cold Stone Creamery and some other stores there. The free continental breakfast was OK. Nothing special except the fresh waffles were very nice - tender crisp and fluffy. The fruit was disappointing - seems to be a common problem with motel continental breakfasts. Mushy apples - blech; but at least there were OK bananas. The L-shaped setup in a corner makes it a little difficult to maneuver around when there is a crowd of people.

First the good: The location is wonderful - in the Lower Quarter, so in the more residential, quiet side, and only a few blocks from Jackson Square, Frenchman St, etc. We loved being so close to everything and having the option to pop back into the hotel any time we wanted. The hotel is very charming, has a great courtyard, and nice pools. I loved swimming in the afternoon and relaxing in the courtyard after wandering around all day. The historic building is neat, really has the old New Orleans feel to it. The rooms are comfortably furnished, and our bed was one of the best hotel beds I've slept in. The staff is very nice. Everyone from the front desk, to the bellman, to the cleaning staff. Now for the not-so good: We had a room overlooking the courtyard, which was nice, however the only windows in these rooms are in the door, which people walk right past - so we had to keep the shutters closed for privacy, otherwise people can see right into your room. So no view of the courtyard while in the room or even any natural light. Nothing really can be done about this - it is a function of the layout of the hotel - if I stayed there again, I would request a room in a different location. Our room was the first as you come up the stairs, so everybody walked by our room. The housekeeping was so-so. They didn't vacuum, didn't dust, didn't clean in the corners of the bathroom, and were very stingy with towels and TP. We actually had to ask for more TP. We put the ONE extra roll in the holder and were not given another roll until we asked a couple days later. No hotel guest should ever have to ask for something as basic as TP. Breakfast was not good - coffee, tea, hard boiled eggs, and cheap (stale) pastries. I has a crossant, but it was so stale that I only ate a couple bites. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and we still skipped it the rest of our trip. I really wanted to give this hotel a better rating because there are things that I loved about it, but there are some things that they just need to work on. It has a lot of potential. It could be really great. I didn't even mind the peeling wall paper and paint since it is an old hotel in a humid place - I expect some of that. If the hotel increased the quality of the breakfast and did a better job with the cleaning, I could easily give this hotel 5* - I would rave about it and tell everybody I knew to stay there.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, but Historic!\u201d", "Author": "HelloSanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR128122429", "Content": "We arrived for the NCAA Final four weekend with high expectations regarding New Orleans and our quite expensive hotel room.

It ended up being perfect for our needs. The hotel is located on the quiet end of the French Quarter, very close to the French Market and a short walk to Jackson Square. It was a perfect location for a family with kids ages 11-20. Even on Mardi Gras day, when there is NO place in the French Quarter that is not completely insane, the courtyard was quiet and serene. Our rooms were comfortable, although very simple, and more than adequate for our needs. We had one room with 2 double beds where I stayed with my 3 daughters, while the \"boys\" (my husband and 17-year old son) stayed in a king-bedded room. They weren't connecting (which would have been great), but were just one door away. The beds were nice, and we all slept well. The service was good, although not outstanding. It would have been helpful to get a general orientation to the services of the hotel, and to the surrounding area when we checked in (for instance, it took me a few days to figure out that they offered a complimentary continental breakfast each morning). Perhaps the service is more hands-on during a less busy time of year. Some tips: - While the beignets at Cafe du Monde are a must at least once during your trip, you can have wonderful pastries without a half-hour line around the corner from the hotel at Croissants d'Or (on Ursiline). It is outstanding! Good lunch options also. - We had a great last-minute dinner at Louisiana Pizza Kitchen about 3 blocks away. - If you are there for Mardi Gras, don't miss seeing Mardi Gras Indians at the Backstreet Cultural Museum. We got there around lunchtime and enjoyed some rice & beans and sodas, and Congo Nation showed up shortly afterwards. A truly awesome & authentic New Orleans experience. - If you are going with kids you can avoid the worst of the Mardi Gras craziness by staying off Bourbon & Decatur. You will see a few topless women, and lots of drunk people, but a lot of what happens is very family friendly.

The search continues. I stayed at the Provincial for three nights in December 2011 while attending a conference. As it was my first trip to NOLA, I wanted to stay somewhere charming and historic in the French Quarter, instead of the generic conference hotels. The first room that I was assigned, in Building 5, absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke (that kind of smell that has been building up for decades and can't be removed unless you change the wallpaper and carpets), despite the fact that all rooms are supposedly smoke-free. The fact that the window in that room was sealed shut didn't help. Luckily, the hotel was able to re-assign me. My second room, in Building 2 (street-side and right above the lobby), was slightly larger and brighter, and had large shuttered windows. The bed was comfortable. I was surprised that the room didn't have a desk - a pretty important amenity when traveling for work. Otherwise the furnishings were fine. The wifi was pretty reliable. The rest of my stay was just so-so. A couple of gripes: - Breakfast doesn't begin until 8AM - pretty useless if you are traveling on business. Considering it's just a cold continental buffet I don't see why they couldn't put it out an hour earlier - I was seriously annoyed on my first night to be startled awake by the in-room alarm clock that had been set by the previous guest and not turned off. This is detail that should be on Housekeeping's check-list in between guests, and it an unacceptable detail to miss in my opinion. - Pretty much every outdoor area in the hotel permits smoking. There was even an ash tray and smokers' seating area directly outside my room on the terrace/walkway between rooms. No wonder half the rooms stink of smoke! - I slept with earplugs, but if I didn't I would have been quite disturbed by noise at night, not just from the street but also from the courtyard within the hotel and guests coming and going. Overall I am still very glad I chose to stay in the French Quarter at a historic property, especially as I got a pretty great rate on the room. The location is perfect.

Had a block of 15 rooms scattered throughout the hotel including building 500 at the back of the property. If you are looking for a hotel that exudes the French Quarter this is it. Yes it is old.

The photographer, musician, and the selections suggested for a group dinner were all spot on. A short civil ceremony was held in the courtyard next to the fountain. Robert was extremely helpful with on-site preparations. The courtyard fountain was also the gathering point for everyone in the party.

It's rooms vary and are furnished primarily with antiques. My own spacious room was on the second floor overlooking one of the courtyard pools. This hotel's location is certainly its strong point. From here it's an easy stroll to sample the frenzy of Bourbon St. nightlife, or to taste beignets and chicory coffee at the Cafe du Monde, or to enjoy the painters and musicians in Jackson Square, or to catch sunrise on the Mississippi levee.

Though pricey, and a tad prim, Stella! appeared to provide every diner with five or six waitpersons, all of whom treated me impeccably despite my casual clothing.

The only off-notes for me at the Provincial were my smallish bathroom (the toilet area was a bit cramped for a large-ish fellow), and the somewhat confined breakfast area. Though I quickly discovered that one could take breakfast items outside to the adjacent courtyard and enjoy the morning seated among the wrought iron garden furniture by one of the fountains. How civilized is that!?! Once I returned home, I discovered that an office colleague had also found the Provincial on his own and loved it.

Since there are \"five\" buildings associated with this hotel, I can only assume the others stayed in a different building. We stayed in building \"five\" which is supposed to be the oldest and most haunted. In case you did not know, the Hotel Provincial is supposed to be one of the most haunted places in New Orleans. As near as I can tell, the only thing haunting this place is the lack of money to fix it up a bit. But, if you don't get your hopes up, there are things to like about this place. For one thing, I loved the location. It is down town, (down river) in New Orleans, and just a half block away from both the old Convent of the Ursuline Nuns, and a half block away from the Beauregard/Keyes House. Also, since it is on Chartres Street, it is a short walk from Jackson Square, the St. Louis Cathedral, and Cafe du Monde. It's not too far from Bourbon Street, either. The location, the history, and the price are all great, but it goes down from there. Our room was almost completely devoid of significant decoration. I understand keeping with the historic designation, but the room was bland, poorly kept, and in need of repair. Our faucet dripped the whole time we were here, the air-conditioner was very noisy, and this was the only hotel room I have ever stayed in that did not have any tourist information in it at all. The only information in this room was a local phone book. Don't get me wrong. I didn't entirely hate the place. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The continental breakfast was adequate, and I loved that high-speed internet was included in the price. If you can get a good deal on this place, (as we did), take it, just don't expect too much and you'll be OK. After all, you aren't in New Orleans to spend all day in your room, right? Oh, by the way, you might be interested in this little note on the service. When we arrived, the clerk at the desk gave our keys to the bellman to show us to our room. He did not even offer to open a door or carry our luggage. Then, when we were out of site of the clerk, but in visible range of the building, he pointed out which building was ours, gave us our keys, and left.

Finding the right location was key when I was researching since we were planning to not rent a car which I do not regret at all BTW. The hotel was short cab ride from the airport. When we went to check in our rooms were not ready but the front desk was glad to lock up our luggage while we explored the area. Once ready everything was smooth & effortless. We booked through expedia which I do for work often and had ZERO issues what so ever. No hidden charges, extra fees, unwanted surprises - ETC from the hotel. (They do charge for parking if you do have a car $22 per day but its a secure lot with valet that brings the car right out for you.) We got a chance to see 2 types of rooms since my friends where in one location (right off the courtyard) and us another (building 500). I guess some of the rooms in building 500 are suppose to be haunted (why I booked the location ;oD) but we did not experience anything. Both rooms were comfortable w/ that old world charm. (Its not modern but clean and quiet at night!!) Beautiful Courtyard to relax, read, have breakfast & coffee. (They have a pool but it was to cold to swim when we went/they have restaurant on-site Stella but didnt get a chance to go - its $$$$$). Front Desk was helpful with everything from directions, dining recommendations, to tour suggestions even booking tours for us at a discount. A computer was available for free as well to print out boarding passes on our last day. They serve a free cont .breakfast. Mind you it isnt glam but has the basics: fruit, bagels (toaster), danish, muffins, coffee, tea, juice and hard boiled eggs which you dont often see at cont. breakfast. Enough to start the day with something in your stomach and save a little $$. Coffee/Tea served all day. The hotel was close to everything: French Market, Original Cafe du Monde, Jackson Square, Cathedral, Riverwalk, Bourbon, Frenchmen St etc etc. (These directly behind the hotel.) If you are lucky enough to be in the back building of the hotel you can hear amazing music from the streets at the French market. We walked everywhere. Since it was so beautiful a walk felt like 5 minutes but could have been 20 or more. We lucked out because the weather was gorgeous all week - Sunny and 60-70's. Food Recommendations: Quarter Master which is like a mini mart (if you forgot to pack something) but has a deli counter in back for breakfast/lunch/dinner - good Cheap Eats!! Mona Lisa Pizzeria - Great Pizza/Salad, Louisiana Pizza Kitchen - Amazing Food, Best Po'Boy was Royal Street Cafe -Catfish Po'Boy was AMAZING, NOLA by Emeril - our splurge but was worth it. Take your time to check out places to eat - there are so many to choose from you can go all out some nights and take it down a notch on others - cost wise!!

This really is our favorite location in the French Quarter. I like that it is close to the Marigny neighborhood, because I think that the close proximity to those restaurants and music venues is great. We arrived around 1 pm on a Wednesday, and were greeted by a charming lady, she got us registered, and arranged to drop off our bags, then gave us a map and sent us out with 3 lunch suggestions. She said they would call when our room was ready. The posted check in time was 3 pm, which we knew, and having a room ready early is just the luck of the draw I think. Her lunch suggestions were Coop's Place, Fiorella's (both on Decatur about a block away) and The Gumbo Shop a littler farther away. We already knew and liked Coop's anyway, so we went there, had a delicious lunch, and actually did get a phone call from them at about 2 to let us know our room was ready. That was neat, I never actually had that happen before. Is this just me? Do you normally get called to say your room is ready if you check in early? It was appreciated. Our room was #210, on the 2nd floor in the courtyard over the pool. This hotel has funny sections, there are 2 main courtyards, one with a fountain, one with a pool. Then there are more rooms tucked around the side that are on a smaller fountain courtyard, and then I think there are some with small balconies overlooking Ursulines Street. The room was cute, nice looking antique-style furniture. The door had glass shutters that could open and also stay closed and adjust the louvers from the inside, and this faced the pool area. Average in size. The bathroom had a split toilet/shower room from the sink/vanity. This is a nice feature for couples to get ready at the same time. Standard toiletry amenity package. Decent towels- not skimpy, not overly plush. The pool in late March was still a bit chilly for all but the hardiest of guests. We are hardy, but were too busy for a dip, darn! Also, because it is in a courtyard, you have to time the sun right if you want to be in a sunny spot. I am sure this is not an issue in the summer, when you drip sweat even in the shade... This hotel is often popular with groups, and the groups tend to congregate in the courtyard areas for some conversation and drinks. When a large group was up later than us in the fountain courtyard, we couldn't hear them at all from the pool courtyard area. The pool area states that it closes at 10 pm. We were never bothered by noise from other people, but I think if you were super sensitive, and there were groups outside up late & hanging out in the courtyard, you might be bothered. Our only complaint was the shower. The shower head was short for us. We're on the taller side (5'7\" + 6'1\") and it was a little comical, but we got clean. And you got a cold blast if a neighboring room flushed the toilet. At least I assume that is what sped the cold blast along. It was the right timing for it anyway. We did not partake of the free continental breakfast, which looked like coffee, pastry and fruit. We prefered the Croissant d'Or shop around the corner on Ursulines Street. Excellent Croissants- so flaky & buttery, not those yucky ones you get that taste like bad danish in some places! YUM. Also fun was the chocolate espresso, and their take-away sandwiches looked good too. If you have the time, a visit to the Beauregard-Keyes House and Old Ursulines Convent- both across the street from the hotel- are both worthwhile. B-K House, allow 1 hour, tours hourly, Convent- self-guided with a flyer tour, tour guide available inside who just keeps rotating through the rooms but isn't on a set schedule. We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful, and aside from the funky shower issues, there was nothing that would entice us away from Hotel Provincial for our future visit.

We had several heavy suitcases but was aptly aided by the valet. All the rooms are off an outside corridor overlooking a beautiful courtyard and shouldn't be a deterrent. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms were fine if not a bit outdated but again, this is a historical building and everything was clean and functioned well. There is a beautiful, huge pool located in the back courtyard and looked extremely inviting. My only negative review is that the walls are a little thin.

Thanks to some other nice guest we did find our room, the numbers of the blocks were barely lit. We carried our suitcases up the 23 step stairs ourselves. We are young, so that is not an issue but i can imagine that older people would get in trouble. The room was clean, no doubt about that. The bed comfortable and good pillows. The airco in the room worked well and was not noisy. The bathroom was small but was more then enough. There were soaps and shampoo but you only get those once. They don't get replaced when you use them up. We slept on the side of the convent and it was fairly quiet on that side. Only on Saturday night there was a lot of noise. The rooms have no double glazing in the windows and you really hear everything. There is TV in the room but very poor quality. There is no list of the channels. The movie network did not do anything. There is no minibar, no microwave, no coffeemaker in the room. There is an ironing board and a hair blower. Internet was available but you have to log in every time you want to use it. Breakfast is kind of little joke. It's very small and very limited. Butter, jam, and cheese. Very little variety. The coffee is available all day, as is the tea. Orange juice only in the morning. We found a little bakery around the corner that had great breakfast and you could buy things to take with you and have breakfast in the room. Overall we were happy cause we weren't that much in the room. The people that work there are not so friendly, but the girl that checked us in was. They don't ask if you need anything or if you are ok. They are totally not interested and just work there because you got to work somewhere. There is not one sign that anybody that works there loves his or her job. The pool is not really nice to swim in and housekeeping even came in the afternoon.

There were lots of little places to sit and relax, especially in the morning with a cup of coffee and pastry. The continental breakfast they do is a nice little touch. Go exploring around the hotel - there is more to this place than you think, lots of little hidden courtyards. - Cons: Our bathroom was in need of a remodel. The floor of the tub/shower felt unstable and everything was just a little dingy (or maybe \"worn\" is a better word). There was no in room safe, although there are small (and I mean small) safes behind the lobby desk for guests use. If you have anything like a laptop or professional camera that you want to put away, you're out of luck. Another downside for us was no minibar/fridge in the room and no kind of bar/lounge in the hotel.

Go to Stanley for brunch.] If you have a room in any of these locations, don't plan on sleeping in. They get very loud, very early in the morning with deliveries and trash pick-up.

We were able to get complimentary parking with our stay and that saved immensely. There is also a very nice on site restaurant called Stella! Loved the french doors to the room. Cons- The deluxe queen room we booked was in many ways a huge disappointment. As this was our first stay in NOLA, I was looking forward to a lovely antique room. In reality, it appeared that the furniture was dilapidated and the room was dark with a poorly laid out floorplan for the bathroom. The bedframe was metal and appeared to be from the 1970's with some tarnishing/rusting of the copper. The spread was simply unattractive. The nightstand next to the bed had a broken drawer and the wallpaper was peeling. The dresser had one edge being lofted with a small folded stack of papers to keep it from tilting. The bathroom was very narrow and the toilet seat was in need of replacing. Overall, it was a good deal for the price, but it was not the fantasy of an adorable French Quarter historic hotel.

Our rooms were in the main building which was a nice historical French Quarter building with patio's (one with pool). My room was nice, spacious enough (though not huge) and clean. Also, the airconditioning worked fine,which was a relief as it was pretty warm and humid. I did not have any plumbing problems as has been mentioned here, just had to wait a bit longer for the hot water sometimes. The service at the front desk was ok, although not always fast, but that appears to be the New Orleans way, as we experienced this everywhere we went. Breakfast is simple but sufficient, and of good quality. The internet connection was good, they have several networks, you just have to figure out which was is stongest in your room. The pool is very nice, but not very large. It was fine when we were there, but I can imagine that it may get quite crowded during high season. However, it works fine to cool off, and you don't go to NO to train for the olympics anyway.... On the negative side, there are just two points. First, the hotel does not have a bar, so for drinks you have to rely on vending machines which only serve sodas (no OJ, beer etc) and for snacks you have to go outside. No problem during the day, but after seven it may get hard to find a place to get these things (to take home that is, there are plenty of bars around if you want to go out). Second, the rooms are quite noisy. We had rooms above the restaurant, where they is a constant howl from the vent as well as the live music, and rooms around the patio, which can be noisy if you have bad luck with your co-guests. It was not a big problem when we were there, but again, during busy weekends you may be better of in one of the side buildings. All in all, very nice hotel at a good location.

What I loved most about the romm was if you opened the transfer (old-time window above your door used as air conditioner back in the day) at night, you could hear the water fountain in the courtyard or you could open your shuttered double French doors for some night air and ambiance. We were there the first week of March, so it was very quiet and I never saw many guests except at morning coffee in the lobby. GREAT coffee btw. Walking through the gas lit courtyard at night was like stepping back in time. This is a beautiful hotel except for a couple of things. When they modernized the hotel & put in restrooms, they skimped a bit-well, more than a bit. They put in toilets that belong more in a gas station rest room than a fine hotel room-which this would have been but for the bathroom. Think flushing with your foot & you'll know what I mean. Then there's the water heater situation...I'm not sure what was going on, but every couple of minutes the temperature would change in my shower. I'd either get a blast of freezing water, or scalding water. Other small upgrades need to be done like the antique light/fan dial thingy in the bathroom. I thought it was for your typiical heat lamp, but it wasn't..still not sure & forgot to ask. The lino & carpet could do with updating too, but it was average.

The wide screen television and free high speed internet were a great amenity to have, as was the coffee, tea, and assorted baked goods each morning down in the lobby. The courtyards are nice, too, especially with the wonderful November weather we enjoyed down there, but I wouldn't swim in either of the pools on a bet.

We also had to work our room switch around lunch reservations. The woman working the desk that night we arrived did not seem competent to handle the problem, nor horribly apologetic about our hassle. The room was nice, but the bathroom left plenty to be desired. The toilet was rocky, the shower was dingy. There was a big wet spot on the carpet next to one of the beds (I don't even want to know...) The doors to the outside were difficult to close and took slamming to get them shut. This makes for a very noisy place. Also, given that the doors did not seal properly, as people sat outside in the courtyard below to smoke in the morning, the smell permeated our room.

There was an elevator in the building and the best thing about the room if you are there on the weekend is that the window opens to a balcony where you can sit out and listen to the bands in the French Market from your own room. The only thing about this door is that it was a large window that had to be propped up by the ironing board so really there should have been some way of keeping it open. This room was close to everything, but not too noisy except for the sirens on Dekatur St at night...not the hotel's fault. The plumbing in the particular room is due for updating..but as many have said this hotel has charm. It is too bad that they did not offer any kind of early morning coffee or continential breakfast. They did offer this on Sunday, but as we had to go to the conference centre it was hard to find a place to have breakfast in the quarter..in fact last time they had a little coffee shop which was now closed.

The photo on their web site was just what I was looking for and was assured of this on the phone. Upon arrival our suite was located in Building 300 and was not at all similar. Also, I know NOLA can be stinky, but our room on the first level was quite musky (a term not familiar w/the staff or perhaps the South in general). However...upon a visit to the front desk I was informed they were sold out and that the room I had originally described may or not be available tomorrow (not). I asked for a 2nd level location hoping for perhaps an improvement on the moisture situation. Sure enough, the suite above was available and much better. My thinking is many of the tight/dark areas in the quarter really do not catch much of a breeze and very little sunlight, especially on the lower levels.

It clearly showed its age (chipped plastering in some places, traditional brown decor) but I guess that goes with the charm. The only thing I would say is that if you are a serious business traveler and in need of business amenities--you won't find it here. The only thing the Provincial had was a fax machine (no business center, so I had to use efax to fax myself documents). I would suggest the Omni Royal if you are looking for a more business-traveler friendly hotel. The staff was very sweet and accomodating and everyone said 'hi' to you when they saw you. One thing I thought was a little weird was that I did not get daily maid-service--I am not sure if it's because of reduced staff with Katrina or not--but if you call the front desk they are pretty quick in getting whatever you need.

Both trips we received an unbelievably low rate ($69/$59) per night!!!! and were treated like welcomed friends! The staff was amazing, courteous, efficient, and friendly. This was consistent on both trips! The hotel is comprised of several buildings surrounding a center parking lot (great if you're driving to New Orleans where it is impossible to park) each building is charming in it's own right, unique --- with twists and turns and hidden courtyards! At night the place is especially magical with illuminated pools (2) several fountains and gas lamps! This is the true New Orleans, and the property has an authentic, old style charm and so you will not find it to be \"disney-esque\" (it really is old, not just made to \"feel\" old) or sterile. Yes, there is moss growing on the brick here and there, and it's utterly charming! You won't find the sterile immaculate opulance of an expensive, overpriced and (frankly --boring (yawn!) upscale hotel that could be literally ANY city or any country in the world. If you like cookie cutter \"upscale\" properties -- that no matter how \"grand\" all seem exactly the same --- those ubiquitous pianos in the lobby--- and polished elevator doors, this is not for you. In fact, there are no elevators. If you stay at the Provincial, you will KNOW you are traveling in New Orleans and no place else! It's truly charming. Entrances on both Chartres street (front entrance) and Decatur (back entrance) -- this is a PERFECT location in the French Quarter. It is in a very quiet section, yet just blocks from all the action and nearby attractions. The quiet is all the more appreciated because you can hear quite regularly the clip clop of the tourist buggies and horse (mule) drawn carriages. While the entire property is quiet once inside, the Decatur street entrance is busier and bustling at night, ever so slightly in an 'off-beat' way...and the front entrance is very quiet and residential. Both have security past 10/11 pm and require a room key to pass security guards and/or locked doors/gates. The small and very friendly Honfluer Bar is part of the property, and looks out on busy Decatur Street -- was recently remodeled in December 04.

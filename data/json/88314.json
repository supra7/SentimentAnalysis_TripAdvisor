A study desk with a lamp was also in the room but I thought it was in a terrible position since it's right next to the AC unit. I was exposed to regular blasts of cold air when I sat there.

I saved $20 per nite ($54.00 total) by joining their promotional frequent traveler program. I had also called the hotel so I am positive of the savings. The suite I had was an open concept unit. Queen Bed, pull out sofa bed and full kitchen. Good: Pet friendly with ample grassy area to walk doggie. Nice pool. Newer towels and sheets. FULL size kitchen. Bad: Carpets need replaced. Bed is NOT a pillow-top and I woke with a back-ache. Had to purchase cleaning solution and clean the coffee stains from the kitchen sink, the wall behind the kitchen sink as well as the bathroom sink area and bathtub (had hairs in them). No dishwasher and no dishsoap provided. The room was musty smelling. As per our little doggie, other dogs must have urinated in various areas in the room. (so much for the \"extra cleaning\" fee's when you book with a pet) I stayed on a weekend so there was no special amenities such as a breakfast. There is no daily housekeeping and the room shows it. As I mentioned, numerous areas not up to par with a \"DELUXE\" version of Extended Stay. The front desk person was pleasant enough, but really didn't fill me in, even where the pool was located. I also saw a woman walking down the hall that appear to be medicated or otherwise impaired when I first was checking into my room. Kinda scary with a \"cheap\" long-term housing type hotel. I have knowledge that people just coming out of prison(on parole etc) sometimes stay at these cheap long-term hotels. The Homewood Suites, (almost next door) is much nicer, more deluxe \"suite\" choice in the area, but you will pay 2 or 3 times more for the room, even when there are no races at Daytona Speedway. However, it IS much, much nicer, cleaner and more comfortable. I would go back but only because of the price. I think in this case you DO get what you paid for.

I was a bit reluctant, since it sounded a bit dated and small but I trusted trip advisor. Wow this place was great!!! Tripadvisor was right again!!!! Along with the partial oceanfront room that I had right ON THE BEACH, the pool was HUMONGOUS and great for kids!!! I was soooo surprised. It has an indoor pool enclosed in glass with vaulted ceilings with a view of the beach. The game room for kids was also on the same floor. The kids could play games and win tickets and then cash them for prizes. You could step out of the pool and right on to the beach. The rooms were extremely spacious with a separate \"living room\" The place was clean and most importantly very kid friendly.

The rooms were immaculate, the bedding was extremely comfortable and the amenites were very nice. As for comments that the hotel is \"outdated\", I find that absurd. Not having giant flat-screen TVs in every room does not make a hotel outdated. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. There was a minor problem with the shower head and it was fixed immediately. The outside grounds, restaurant and bar were fantastic and the views were beautiful.

While the hotel may have some faults, its positive features outweigh the negative ones. In reading other reviews I feel that too much attention is placed on irrelevant issues such as friendliness of the hotel staff and room decor. Honestly, although the furniture may be dated, that ought not affect your stay at the hotel. My biggest complaint is the lack of lighting in the room which is an issue prevalent to many hotels. The layout of the room in which the kitchen area separates the living room portion with the bedroom part of the room was convenient as it permitted adults and children to have their own television sets and sleeping/quiet areas. The hotel is especially appealing to families with toddlers through pre-teens. We were at the beach for only one hour and we noticed that most families brought their own beach chairs and umbrellas ostensibly as other reviewers noted the cost of renting a chair was $7.00 and an umbrella was $14.00. There was a bar at the beach which was a covenient amenity as well as a gazebo bar which served light snacks and some food in the edge of the atrium. When traveling to Ocean City, the first decision you need to make is whether to stay on or off the boardwalk. While the boardwalk location is convenient, the noise and crowds makes it more advantageous for adults traveling without children. There also is a plethora of restaurants and activities within several miles of the hotel in either direction which cater to families without the constant barrage of people and noise endemic to the boardwalk. Traveling to the boardwalk area from the hotel was only about a ten to fifteen minute ride. For restaurants we ate one night at an all you can eat restaurant and a la carte restaurant where several of us ordered all you can eat crabs for twenty five dollars. The restaurant was called On the Bay and was located on Coastal Highway in the 40's. This was a casual place where you ordered and paid at the cashier and the food was then delievered to one of the outdoor benches. The crabs were tasty and opening the crabs with a mallot was half the fun. We also ordered a large bucket of french fries from Thrasher's while on the boardwalk for ten dollars which was a great mini-lunch. Jolly Roger's Amusement Park on the pier was okay for the money. Old Pro Golf was a good after dinner event. They have three locations, and we ended up going to the 136th Street location when the one in the 60's was overly crowded. In general, the Royal Princess is an above average hotel which caters to families. If you are expecting services and amenities comparable to five star hotels such as the Ritz Carlton you will be disapponted. Similarly, if you expect fashionable and chic accomodations, crystal clear blue water and fine dining you will also be disappointed.

The reservation was made months ago. As our trip approached, and we read comments on TripAdvisor, we became concerned. We take a trip to Ocean City on a yealy basis and were looking for a new place to stay. Prior to our trip, we contacted the Princess Royale regarding the reviews. We travel a few times a year and understand that each person visits with their own perspective and expectations. We wanted to be assured that our room was clean and well maintained. Ms. Diane Anderson assured us that that would be the case. We were not disappointed. We arrived at the hotel about 4 hours before check-in. The front desk staff was cheerful and friendly. Our room was not ready, but we were issued a parking pass and were permitted to use the hotel facilities. After enjoying the beach, the pool, and lunch, we called and our room was ready. The bell-hop quickly and efficiently unloaded our car (which was already in the parking garage), showed us to our room, turned on the ice maker in the refrig., and answered any questions. We had a room overlooking the pool/atrium. Our daughter loved the balcony and enjoyed watching people in the pool. The pool closes at 10pm, so there was no issue with noise. The room was larger than others we had stayed at in OC. The room was clean, and maintained. We had no issues with anything in the room. Having a full size refrig. was great for storing our food. The bed was comfortable, and after long days, our daughter had no issues sleeping on the pull-out sofabed. The pool was clean, as was the beach. We had no issues with the elevators, although we heard others complaining about the wait when it was check-in time. Breakfast was included as part of our package. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and the food was hot. There was a variety to suit everyone's taste. We did get hot dogs and fries from the \"food court\" near the beach. It was okay. We ate at the dinner buffet one evening. There was a large variety of food ---plenty to satisfy the seafood lover, the meat eater, and children. The food was hot and continuously refilled. The only complaint we would have about the buffet was the milkshake machine----wasn't working properly---very thin---but all of the children appeared to enjoy adding the toppings to their \"milk\". One day we ordered lunch from the retaurant \"to-go\" so we could eat on the beach. There was no problem getting the food to go, and the wait time was minimal. All staff members that we came into contact with seemed friendly and were working hard. We loved having a beachfront hotel with an indoor pool! It was a nice reprieve from the hot sun! Each day, our room was cleaned while we were at breakfast. Towels and amenities were restocked. We enjoyed our stay and plan to return. This is a great beachfront hotel that met all of our expectations.

First thing the rooms do need up dated like walls and bathroom and new sofa bed I tried to have my children sleep on iit and you could feel ever spring/support bars. Also the price for a night stay you pay for like a 4 star room but you get 3 star. But all the stuff I have read below is crazy the rooms are clean the carpet was clean didnt have a smell at all. All the staff was very very well. Besides the rooms needing a little bit the rest is very nice. Parking Deck alittle tight!!!I do wish this place had outside pool but it was not a real big deal when you have the big ocean. Also maybe a outside play area for kids. Now all the goods the pool was always clean when i was in it same with the hot tubs. The bar inside and outside are nice and bartenders know there drinks. Arcades was nice but some didnt work but expected. Front desk and staff and maid very nice well manored. Over all i rate this hotel a 3 star not a 4 becasue of price and rooms needing a little updateing. I will more then likely go back!!!!!

We were very disappointed. This is an old hotel in a state of decay. Everything looked worn and in need of repair. Peeling paint; molding rotting and falling off. Generally cheap feel. Hotel pool atrium has real potential but falls shorts. The elevators are dangerous and the doors will quickly slam on you or your 4 year old child like a hammer so beware. The staff was neither excellent or poor. No major complaints or praises there. Our rooms was very disappointing. The flooring was down right gross. Sticky old/worn carpet, and old stained tile. The bathroom ceiling was stained and falling apart. Bathroom fixtures were somewhat functional and cheap. Kitchen appliances were several decades old. Some of our unit's counter tops were upgraded to granite and we had one flat screen TV so it appears the hotel is trying. The beach is wonderful and the only reason to even look at this place. The beach front restaurant was a lovely space lined by palm trees overlooking the ocean, but once again marred by cheap furniture, peeling paint, and overall cheap feel. The burgers were very good though. The management will have to put a lot of capital into this place to bring it up to par with what most people expect nowadays from a premium beach resort.

After visiting several hotels and hearing over and over again that there were either no rooms available or not enough to handle our group, I stopped by the Princess Royale Hotel. Not only did they have a few rooms, though they had a convention there, we were able to get one of the three bedroom condos - which was perfect for our group. I must say that out of all the people we talked to trying to find a place to stay, I for one was thankful for Olga at the Front Desk of the Royale. When we explained our situation, she was quick to recommend the condo instead of having us in several rooms. Orginally, we were only going to stay one night. We ended staying three!!!. The condo was spacious, great views and was the perfect fit for us all. The first morning of the trip, I sat on the balcony and watched the sun rise. Something I haven't done in at least 20 years. This was an awesome trip and I will be heading back to the Princess Royale when we take our annual holiday shopping spree. I just hope Olga and the rest of the staff at the Front Desk are there. With their knowledge of the hotel and the surrounding areas, they were the second best part of the trip. My friends are still talking about our trip and even suggesting we take another one soon.

We have stayed there twice in one Summer several times over the years. We have tried other OC hotels a few times and the Princess Royale is still our favorite beach hotel in OC. The rooms are perfect for a small family group since there is a full size fridge, stove and microwave in the kitchen area which allows the option of preparing a meal in the room at least once during your stay. The rooms are very spacious and well laid out. The kids can sleep on the sofa bed in the living room/kitchen area and parents have a large bedroom suite to themselves. One minor negative comment - the sofa beds seem to be pretty old and probably should be replaced. We always reserve a pool level room since they have the best access to the beach. Even when the pool and atrium level are crowded, shuttting the door to the atrium keeps the noise out of the room. The pool is great for bad weather days - it's one of the largest indoor pools in OC. It's great to be able to let the kids play in the pool on rainy days or when they just want to get out of the sun for a while. The beach in front of the hotel is always clean and never overcrowded. The landscaping between the beach and the hotel is very attractive - the palm trees planted there create a \"tropical\" feeling in the beach bar area. The rooms are always clean and the staff always friendly and helpful. Not sure why some other reviewers have had problems in those two areas - in 20 years' time we have not had bad experiences with room cleanliness or rude staff. And then there's the parking - other OC Hotels that provide free parking often don't have enough spaces for all the guests and some have to find parking spaces wherever they can. There are always enough parking spaces at the Princess Royale AND all parking is inside a garage which keeps your car out of the hot sun all day. We have a lot of favorite restaurants in OC so we have not eaten in the hotel restaurant very often. The few times we have eaten there, the food and service has been OK. The hotel has recently renovated and updated some aspects of the rooms - the tempurpedic matresses in the bedroom suites are especially nice! Overall, we are convinced that the Princess Royale is the best value in OC and plan to keep staying there for future vacations. Bottom line is that our family has nothing but happy memories of the many times we've stayed there!

Here's my take on those themes: - This is not a business hotel This is 100% true. I do a lot of business travel, and would have been horrified if I had to stay here, as, well, it's a beach hotel teeming with families and kids. Fortunately, we were there for vacation, and this did not detract from out stay, but rather added to it, as the kids got to meet other kids, etc. - The WiFi is bad This depends on where you are. If you're closer to the halls, it was fine for hotel WiFi. As you got closer to the patio and outdoors, the signal did drop significantly. So, my first-world problem was that if I wanted to browse the internet, I had to do it inside vs. outside. Thus, I opted to just relax and enjoy the view on the patio vs. use the internet. - The decor in the rooms are dated 100% true. But - it's a hotel room, not an audition for Better Homes & Gardens magazine. We spent very little time in the room, as we were there for the beach and other activities, so the decor did not detract at all from our stay. There is a flat screen TV in the bedroom and an old school tube TV in the living room of the suite that we had. Our kids don't care. They watched either and didn't complain. - There are several bad smells I don't know if I'd call them bad, but the smell of cleaning supplies is obvious in many places. This would be one of the things that I'd like to see changed, as some of them are stronger than others. Also, the indoor pool did have a strong smell of chlorine for most of the duration that we were there. That could also be toned down a bit as well. - The restaurant was awful I read a LOT of reviews that said this, so rather than try to confirm it, we just avoided it. There are WAY too many better places in OC to have dinner, so this was not an inconvenience at all. We also did breakfast in the suite and had most lunches there, too. We did have one lunch in the restaurant, and while it was not the best meal ever, it also wasn't the worst. - The service is awful This was something that I did not run into. Yes, the staff is largely students from Europe on work-study visas, but you know what? If you talk to them and are actually nice, they are nice in return, too! Not all of them speak English, but all of their English is way better than any second language that I speak. We did have a couple of issues with the room - all of which were resolved quickly. For example, the dishwasher broke on the 2nd day and flooded over onto the floor. I called the front desk, and within a couple of hours, we had a brand new dishwasher installed. The ice maker also didn't work; same resolution within just a few hours as well. And lastly, the microwave broke on the last day, and we saw them replacing it as we were checking out. Was this a hassle? Nah. I didn't care. We were able to get all of the ice we needed from the bar at no charge, and after all, we were on vacation, and I wasn't going to let a faulty appliance or two spoil the fun. They also said that this winter, many of the rooms will be completely renovated, which will be great. I was initially worried that being up on 91st Street would put us too far from where all of the activities were, but that is 100% not the case. The location was awesome, as everything in OC is just a few minute drive away. There is also no shortage of restaurants, shops & mini golfs up where the hotel is. I'll be honest: this was not the best hotel that I have ever stayed at. But you know what? It was a clean place to sleep with plenty of room for a family of 4, an awesome location with a great beach, and we had a great time there.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland, United States", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is disgusting. 4 star more like negative -4 stars\u201d", "Author": "Jayneil C", "ReviewID": "UR137169486", "Content": "This hotel is not a 4 star it's negative 4 stars because the front desk employees are rude, and they don't know how to act professional.

Overall the stay was pleasant, but I wanted to bring a few things to everyone's attention. At roughly $300 / night, it was a little pricey for, at best, a mediocre hotel. This hotel was probably very nice 20 years ago, but aside from basic maintenance, it still seems stuck in the 90's. We had a DECENT stay and the following review may seem a little nit-picky, but these are the things that just didn't sit well with us. First, the GOOD: excellent customer service, everyone we spoke to from bell-hop to maid to receptionist to restaurant hostess/waitress were all excellent and very very nice. The walk to the beach was very short and beach itself was very nice and clean. Parking was also very easy and just a short walk away from the lobby. Tempur-pedic mattress was very comfortable. Also w/ a family of 4, the kitchen came in very useful. Utensils and dishes were supplied and very clean. All appliances worked properly, but were probably 10+ yrs old. No stainless steel. BAD: the elevators are VERY slow. You also have to take another elevator in the parking garage and that one is even slower than the ones in the hotel. Perhaps this was because we went during busy season, so take it w/ a grain of salt, but it was an average wait of about 45secs to 2 mins for every elevator. To access the beach, you have to go through the atrium and down a flight of stairs. And although this isn't a big deal, if you have a beach cart, it's impossible. Therefore, you have to go all the way around the building or cut through the restaurant on the side. Perhaps I missed something in the navigation, but these were the directions given to me by the staff. Seemed kind of inconvenient. The \"heated\" pool was pretty cold and the game room seemed old. The business center consisted of one single computer. As for the room itself, aside from the tempur-pedic mattress, everything was mediocre (at best). One flat screen in the bedroom and an old TV in the living room. No HD programming or guide. And even though no one really comes to the beach to watch TV, it would've been nice to be able to find one or two channels in the morning without having to scroll through 60+ channels. And again, it's 2012, who doesn't have HD programming? Or who has a box TV for that matter? The sofa-bed is........well how I can put this delicately........disgusting. The cushions looked and felt like they haven't been changed in 30 years and the mattress that flipped out had stains and was very uncomfortable. I know that it is a sofabed and it can't ever be as comfortable as a real bed, but that cannot be an excuse for the condition of this piece of furniture. There is one air conditioning unit that cools both sides of the suite (the bedroom and living room). However in the bedroom, it blew a lot harder than the living room, so it was freezing in one room and much warmer in the other room. The unit is also right next to the bed, so it's pretty loud at night if you're a light sleeper. The front door is also very thin and when sleeping in the sofa-bed, you can hear EVERYTHING in the hallway. And while most fellow patrons were quiet and courteous, we could still hear people walking, kids running and screaming occasionally. Again, if you're a light sleeper, the comfort (or lack thereof) of the sofa-bed and noise from the hall make sleeping in the living room quite difficult. On a side note, we have a toddler and an infant. Both take naps. We made the mistake of getting a room w/ an atrium/pool view. The noise from the atrium makes it pretty hard for naps. This is no fault of the hotel's. Just a tip for anyone w/ kids that nap, perhaps an oceanview / oceanfront room would be a little more quiet. In summary, would we stay at PR again? If the price were lower, yes. After all, this is simply a hotel at a beach and not the Ritz Carlton. But at the price that we paid, it did not seem worth it to us. Again, let me say that the staff could not have been nicer and service could not have been better. BOTH WERE FANTASTIC. Perhaps we expected too much from all the positive reviews here or perhaps we're just anal, difficult customers. But while PR provided us w/ a pleasant stay, the resort itself just didn't quite live up to expectations.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williamstown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNever Again...\u201d", "Author": "Angela R", "ReviewID": "UR136238982", "Content": "I booked my last summer vacation at the Princess Royale in Ocean City, MD in March, as I have for over 15 years.

The first room we had, we had to go out on the balcony and lean over to see any ocean, very disappointing. We found that housekeeping conveniently failed to leave certain necessities when servicing the room. We had to call each day and ask for additional towels or wash cloths, we felt this was to encourage additional tipping. The value of the room for the Ocean City area was very good.

The Hilton was sold out so I reluctantly chose the Princess Royale. Made the reservation over the phone speaking with one of their sales reps. Most of her advice was wrong! She recommended a king bed room and that the kids would be fine taking the pullout sofa bed. The next morning they both woke complaining of aching backs. The mattress was so thin and lumpy that we ended up changing to a room with 2 queens. Hotel rep also suggested taking a room overlooking the indoor pool so we could see the boys swimming and not have to walk downstairs to call them. No need for this as the pool is so over-chlorinated that the water is white! The fumes rise up to the roof and since we were on the top floor (5th) the smell was beyond toxic. Any thought of sitting on the tiny balcony is quickly erased due to a fear of passing out from the fumes and falling over the side. The other advantage of taking a room overlooking the courtyard/indoor pool is that you can listen to people playing air-hockey and other arcade-like games at 11:00pm without having to open your balcony door or incurring a further cost. This hotel was built in the early 80's and to my knowledge appears to not have done anything since. Gaudy pink walls in the bathroom with matching pink shower curtain. The shower actually has a seperate hot and cold water tap. Dark green carpets and purple drapes. Is this supposed to be beach-like? Sure the rooms have a large fridge and microwave etc. but it all feels like a cheap motel with old furniture. The hotel is decorated in mirrors on the ceilings by the elevators with small decorative light bulbs alongside. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Everywhere you go are advertisement for some sort of activity - all at an extra cost. While the pool provides free towels to use, the beach does not (and you are not allowed to take pool towels to the beach). No worries however as there is someone set up to rent you towels, chairs and umbrellas at an extra cost. Breakfast is next door in the Schooner restaurant and was included in the room rate. It is basic and not that hygienic looking. Upon completion of the free buffet meal we were presented with a bill for service. Actually a suggestion for gratuity within a range of 15 - 20% based upon the actual cost of the meal were we to purchase this separately. Basically they 'advised' us to pay $18.00 in gratuities for eating at the free buffet. I quickly asked around to the staff in the hotel and found out that most of them are paid a lot less than minimum wage (around $2.50 per hour I was told). They rely on guests to augment their salary through tips. This hotel does have 2 and only 2 features. 1. it sits directly on a wonderful beach with a great surf for the kids and adults alike to play and swim in. and 2. they have surprisingly brought tempur-pedic beds into each room (why I do not know). We have the same bed at home and were amazed at this upgrade. Everything else however is awful. We tried to depart early and were curly told by the less than charming Olga at reception \"No. No refund!\" If this is your first time leaving home or first time to the beach then you may be more impressed than we were but for the price of almost $300.00 per night we expected a lot more.

The suite we had was a side ocean view, with a triangle balcony that overlooked parking on the side of the building and the ocean at a distance. Being on the third floor and closer to the front of the hotel, one could still glance a nice view of waves crashing on the beach. The suite itself was overall comfortable, if not maybe a bit cramped compared to other suites we\u2019ve stayed in. The granite countertops, tempurpedic mattresses, garbage disposal, and flat screen tv were all welcome amenities. I would not advise trying to sleep on the pullout sleeper sofa though, as the mattress was quite old and provided no cushioning whatsoever. This appears to be one of the few things they have left to overhaul in the guest suites. ((Along with a safe that didn\u2019t seem to work properly.)) The pool and atrium area were nice and often quite busy. We never experienced any problems with excessive noise or crowding at the times we went (mid-afternoon). Be expected to sign out towels though, if you didn\u2019t pack your own to tote to the beach. Hot tubs are available both inside the atrium and outside on the sundeck. The beach itself is accessible off of the atrium\u2019s sun deck, on the second floor. Otherwise you can walk through one of the dune walks outside, on either side of the property. We found the easy accessibility to the beach to be a wonderful plus for our stay. As far as other conveniences go, the hotel could improve a bit on some things. The snack bars by the pool and outside are a bit pricey, as to be expected for the convenience of having snacks on hand. The convenience store is not worth any guest\u2019s time. We attempted to buy a pint of ice cream from the store, but discovered that all of them were partially melted.

I replied that it was my daughters first time at the ocean and a room with a nice ocean view would be greatly appreciated if they could work that out. They said they would make a note of it. We arrived a couple of hour prior to official check in time, and was given a parking pass and told we could enjoy all of the hotels ammenities immediatly and to check back periodically to see if a room was available. No problem.....we're on vacation and enjoyed the access to the beach and pool. I did check back a few times at the front desk, and was told, based on our request for a room with a nice view of the ocean, that they didn't have a room that offered that view cleaned yet, and would i mind stopping back by in a little while. No problem. The staff at check in really worked to get us set up in a nice room with a good view of the ocean, just as we requested, and our daughter was tickled pink with the room and the view. We had a King suite with ocean view on the 5th floor. The room couldn't have been nicer for us. Great layout, plenty of room, awesome view, very clean, and my wife couldn't stop talking about how wonderful the temperpedic mattress was! It was very comfortable and so were the pillows. We set our two girls (6 & 1) up in the inner part of the suite on the pull out couch and our pack-n-play crib. It was nice to put them to bed and still be able to close the bedroom door and watch some tv or sit on the balcony and drink some wine. The room was very quiet and we never heard any noises or were bothered in our sleep. The beach and pool were very cool and we really enjoyed them both. On the beach, we had brought a little pop up cabanna with us, but we also rented a beach umbrella every day from Wills Beach Rentals right behind the hotel. an umbrella was $15/day. They also have chairs too, but we brought our own with us. The beach was great, but it we stayed during a heat wave so we went into the pool once in awhile to cool off from the heat. The pool was great for out young kids. My 6 year old put on her vest and snorkel and goggles on and spent hours swimming around the pool. The pool was nice. We ate dinner at Bull on the Beach twice because we enjoyed the food and service. It is located a block away from the hotel. We ate breakfast next door at the breakfast place (Lyton's, or something like that) and it was very good food and reasonably priced. We were at the hotel during the 4th of July, and there were spectacular fireworks at most of the hotels along the beach. It was very cool. One night they showed a movie on the beach, which my daughter really enjoyed. Check out was a breeze. We really enjoyed our family trip to Princess Royale, and look forward to coming back some day.

Appliances and furniture is from 1970s/80s. Food is not good but the beach bar is good. The Staff is a mix. The Vallets and Bellhops are great the the room service, front desk, and especially Managers are horrible. It's understandable that issues may arise from staff but then you know you can take the issue to a Manager for resolution. This is not the case at Princess Royale. It became perfectly clear, why the front desk and room service staff believe they can treat the guest so poorly. Here are the details of my terrible stay and experience. Girlfriend and I checked in and paid in cash, however, we left a credit card on file for expenses as with any hotel you stay in these days. Somehow, the front desk managed to botch placing my CC on file and on the last day, when the gfriend and I ordered breakfast room service, the room service attendant demanded payment. We explained there is a CC on file and she left only to return a few minutes later and again, demanded payment. This time she was rude and implied we were trying to \"rob\" the hotel. Unbelievable. I called down to the front desk and spoke to Jasmine, who sounded like she was taking an order at a drive-thru McDonald's rather than answering a call routed to the Front Desk. She explained she could retrieve the card number on file and charge the service which was okay but then she make comments that there was no issue as though I shouldn't have called the front desk. When I explained there was an issue because we were disrupted during breakfast and also needed to pack and shower so we could check out; she started raising her voice - I simply hung up the phone because I'm not paying $350/night to have the staff yell at me. 10 minutes later, security and the Assistant Manager (Alroc, Alaric, something to that affect) are at my door knocking while I'm in the shower and the girlfiend is getting dressed. She didn't answer the knocks because she was naked and sure enough, they started entering the room but luckily, she finished dressing in time. Girlfriend let them know we would be down at checkout to take care of the issue. I contacted the same Assistant Manager, who reported Jasmine told him I cursed and called her a \"B\" which was an absolute lie. He did zero to resolve the issue and made it completely clear, he could not have cared less about what just occurred from the fact they failed to imprint my card at check-in, to the rude and demanding Room Service attendant, to the fact they tried entering the room while my gfriend was nude; all over $41.60. To boot, the room service took over an hour to arrive and was cold. Assistant Manager didn't care about that either and he refused to provide the General Manager's Name, which I later found out from the Vallet. I have never experienced such a horrible hotel stay.

We have always stayed at Park Place on the boardwalk but because we were worried about the rain, we wanted a place with an indoor pool and this hotel fit the bill and had great reviews from here. As I write this review, this is our second day of a 5 day trip here at this hotel. Let me start with the pros. The room is large. There is a separate bedroom area so that's nice and the kids can go to bed early and my husband and I can do work or read. Second, Willie at the front desk was very nice and helpful and had a great attitude - easy to work with. Third, right on the beach and they offered Thursday night movie on the beach tonight and my kids loved it! Fourth, the pool is nice and big, especially for an oceanfront hotel, and my husband really enjoys the hot tub. Fifth, the shower has one of those drying lines you can pull out and we do like that - it is helpful. Now the cons: When we checked in to the hotel, the front staff was not very friendly and were not able to answer many of our questions (nor did they try) (again, except for Willie) - they seem hurried and could not be bothered and did not even smile. The hotel advertises that the rooms were renovated but the carpet looks old, the TV is old, the couches are old, and you can tell that many of the areas behind tables, in between beds, and next to the dresser were not cleaned (dirt, trash left there, spider webs) and a trash can is broken. I am a stickler for cleanliness and this did not fit my standards - Park Place, while smaller, was always super clean. In addition, the dresser and table tops still had sand on them from previous guests. The coffee mugs still had lipstick stains on them from previous guests. Second, the hotel advertises free WIFI but in the evenings, we could never get on - just too busy or the signal was poor and kicked us off. On vacation, normally we wouldn't need it so much but being in graduate school with exams and online assignments and my husband having deadlines, we were counting on on WIFI. Finally, the beds were not comfortable. My kids even noticed it and my husband's back hurt after one night of sleep. In addition, when we checked in, we wanted to use a coupon we had for free breakfasts. The coupon did not have any restrictions on it on its face and it even said to print it out. So I did print it out and brought it to the hotel, but it turns out that you had to click on it even more to find out the restrictions (but the coupon did not say anything about clicking on it more for restrictions - it just said to print it out). They did not honor the coupon, although the manager did give us a reduced rate on the room (which we appreciated). In general, it was okay. I don't think we will be coming back here, though. The best thing was that the rooms are bigger but other than that, I don't see why this hotel is \"great.\" We are not thrilled with our stay here.

I personally think they should add an outdoor pool too...they seem to have the room and they could probably capture some revenue from drinkers/snackers up there (as opposed to the beach). For the time of year, the prices were a not too bad. Overall the hotel was a little dated and could use some functional and aesthetic tweaks, but it was very clean and welcoming. The furniture and carpets in the rooms were in good condition, but the tile floors and walls could use a little attention (although they were clean). Beds (Tempur Pedic) were very comfortable. Staff was very helpful and courteous. We did not eat at any of the restaurants within the hotel, so I can't comment to the food.

The purpose of this trip was to see if this would be a suitable place for our yearly company retreats. These retreats are a token of my appreciation for their continued support and dedication to my organization. Without boring you with too much detail, here is a summary of the report from the 3 night stay at this hotel: -The room was very nice, however it smelled a bit musty (almost like stale cigarettes) and the furniture was out-dated. -The house-keeping staff did a very average job: the remote was under the covers when the bed was made, the coffee maker was not cleaned and replaced with new coffee for the next day, the coffee sat in the pot for the remainder of the trip (3 days) -The front desk staff was very helpful and were probably the most pleasant part of the stay -On more than one occassion, the valet staff were down-right rude and dis-respectful -When problems were brought to various managers' attention, they laughed and were un-willing to help resolve any problems -It was a contant reminder of the difference between a 2 and a 4 star hotel, this mistake will never be made again -After numerous occasions where the hotel was not performing up to expecations, my clients were ready to leave their vacation early. One of them even stated \" I returned to my hotel room in tears, I was never so ready to leave an oceanfront Suite in my life!\" We are in customer service for a living, so my staff knows what it means and what it takes to provide exceptional customer service. Imagine how disappointing it is to be treated exactly how you DON'T want to treat your own customers! It hurts! What a huge disappointment.. Even though I have no ties whatsoever to this hotel, it still reflects poorly on me, because I made the decision to send my best employees here to have what I hoped to be one of the best vacations they've ever taken. Now I can't take back their bad experience, I can only hope that the next place we decide to stay will be much better than this. I know many people and I have could have told them all about the great experience that was had at this hotel. Unfortunately, I will be telling them something very different, and this hotel will loose a great deal of business as a result of just a 3 night stay that turned out to be a disaster. When one makes a reservation at a hotel, you are patronizing that organization, you are pledging that you will stay at this hotel and you've chosen this particular hotel over the many other options that exist in such a close proximity. In return, one would expect that hotel to provide the guest with exemplary customer service, to make them feel as though they are the most imporant thing at that point in time, to make them want to return to the hotel time and time again. I must say that if the report from my clients were a good one, we were planning on taking a large group of 30+ people once a year to this hotel for a week at a time. Imagine how much money that would be for the hotel!! Now, however, there is no way we will ever give another dollar to this organization. You can not put a price on how someone feels when they are talked down to and mis-treated when they are choosing to stay there over any other hotel! My advice to you is that you do a lot of research before you make a reservation at this hotel. Read all of the reviews. If you do decide to stay there, I sincerely hope that your experience is better than one that was had by my employees.

Walking distance to a supermarket, and to a decent family restaurant where we had breakfast each morning. The beach was huge and the ocean was wonderful. The hotel is a 15-20 minute drive from the Boardwalk. The hotel pool is just as it looks on the website, but we had too much fun at the beach, so never utilized the pool. I would say that the first floor pool rooms don't offer much privacy. We could see straight into people's rooms as we walked through the area. My only issues were 1) all of our key cards were deactivated before the end of our stay. I was told at the front desk that the cards were coded for the wrong departure date. The problem was quickly remedied, but it was a pain, as my entire family had to wait in front of the room wet and with all of our beach gear while I went to the front desk and waited on line for this to be fixed. 2) The bars on the balcony seemed a bit too far apart for my comfort concerning my 2 year old daughter. I was on edge every time she came out on the balcony, and it made me unable to fully relax while out there. I wish the bars were about two inches closer together, or that some sort of mesh was available that we could put up. (There may be, I didn't ask.)

We live in VA and work in DC so it's about a 3-hour drive from the city. I reserved the Princess Royale because we are not the biggest fans of motels, inns etc, also I work in a Hotel in DC so being aware of what could be found in a Hotel room, decided to go with the full service bit more expensive one. They are very highly priced I have to admit but it is peak season so, good for them. The Hotel is definitely not worth $289 per night (this was our daily rate), it should be reasonally priced around $209-229 to be honest. The location is awesome, right off the beach, a 2-minute walk. Loved it! The Hotel room is large, has a living room and a separate bedroom. The furnishing is a bit outdated, sofa had holes in it, but who cared, we did not spend much time on it. The small kitchen area was well-equipped, silverware, plates, glasses and a full fridge. Very handy. There is an in-room coffee maker whcih made me very excited, unfortunately the coffee brewed was horrible, some cheap kind. The bathroom is spacious, had enough towels, not enough toilet paper. The bedroom had Tempurpedic mattress, very very comfortable. We also had a small balcony, teh view is a bit disappointing, if you see a room with a side view, it is literally a side-view, meaning you must lean over the rail to see the water. Don't bother paying more, you don't get more. If there are no ocean-view rooms available, just settle with the regular run-of-house. Don't waste your money on extra hoping to get a view, there is none. We decided to try the restaurant's breakfast buffet, just skip it if you can. Eggs are made out of the powdered thing, taste horrible, bacon is burnt, watermelon was too ripe and a bit sour. We ordered an omelet a la carte - it was so greasy, we could not finish. $50 wasted on bad food. Such a shame. Overall, we loved the Hotel and would definitely return, love the location, free parking, (valet if you can, it is only $6 a night, we are used to $42 in DC!!!!!!) beach at the doorstep.

I'm shocked it got so high a rating on here! We had to call \"engineering\" to the room three times in our three-night stay; once was for a whistling balcony door that sounded like a teapot whistling (they fixed it); another was for a flickering light and drip in the bathroom ceiling--they fixed the light and thought the drip was from an above room. We didn't see water again so I guess it was fixed? The final and worst time was when the (unattractive) plastic grate in the bathroom that was removed to look at the aforementioned problems came crashing down at 1:30am, waking us up and terrifying us with the noise. It turned out the plastic grate was already broken--plastic was snapped--and wasn't put up properly after the earlier visit. When I asked if it's fine to just shimmy the broken piece back up into the same spot I was told that it was broken before and it would be fine. NOT A GOOD RESPONSE! In terms of the overall appearance, the bedroom furniture and mattresses were nice but the carpets were old, the living area was severely outdated, and the shower \"head\" was more like a pipe without an actual head attached. The water pressure, as a result, was uneven and the water itself was prickly on the skin. If you're into a quiet place, this wasn't it either. There were two weddings held right below the oceanfront rooms in the grass area and thus there was music playing throughout the day. Some people won't mind that, but it interrupted the serenity of the ocean. I would NOT stay here again. Our room was falling apart--literally--and it was so far from the boardwalk that the ocean view didn't make up for all it was lacking.

Having a kitchen helped with the cost of meals. There is a supermarket within walking distance. We were able to have breakfast and lunch in the room and ate dinners out. The beds were very very comfortable. I slept on the sleep sofa one night, its a sleep sofa, they are never comfortable, but I have slept on worse. The air conditioner in the room does not have a thermostat so the room got too cold for me at night, then you had to turn it off and it got warm. The beach was very, clean and outside is an umbrella' rental stand. A life guard station is right on the hotel beach as well so we felt very comfortable with the kids being in the water while we sat nearby on the beach. Take your own beach towels for the beach as you cannot use the hotels towels. Having an indoor pool was a life savior as we has a couple of rainy, windy days, and the ocean was chilly. The pool was always staffed although there is no lifeguard at the pool. The hotel was nice and quiet. There was ample parking. The staff were all very friendly. We had one negative experience at the hotel restaurant the one night we went there for dinner.

Having stayed at numerous other O.C. hotels over the years, Princess Royale has become our \u201cHome Away from Home.\u201d We would not think of staying at any other hotel (including Hilton Suites Ocean City Oceanfront, rated the #1 hotel on TripAdvisor.com). Today (June 4) is our 19th wedding anniversary. What do you think I got my husband for an anniversary gift? An upcoming 3-day weekend stay at Princess Royale, of course! My husband thought this was the best anniversary gift ever. We are very excited about our upcoming trip. It\u2019s been over 2 months since our last stay at Princess Royale, and we miss the resort, its comfort, spectacular oceanfront view and all the great amenities. It\u2019s beyond me why anyone would shell out such big bucks to stay at Hilton Suites, when you can get such great deals/rates and a comparable suite and amenities at Princess Royale. We\u2019ve stayed at the O.C. Hilton Suites numerous times in the past, but no more! You could not ask for anything more in an O.C. resort hotel than what Princess Royale has to offer. All clean and well-appointed rooms are \u201cSuites\u201d (Queen or King beds/some with in-room Jacuzzi\u2019s); spacious living room (Queen sleeper sofa); full/furnished kitchen with all the appliances (granite kitchen counters/table); granite bathroom vanities for all your toiletries (which I love); and Tempur-Pedic mattresses (the most highly recommended bed in America). After our first stay at Princess Royale, I went out and purchased a Tempur-Pedic which is the most comfortable bed in which I have ever slept. We always bring our laptop computer and the in-suite wireless high-speed Internet has great connectivity. The suites have two phones and two remote-controlled cable TVs (32\u201d LCD flat-screens). All rooms have a private balcony, electronic in-room safe and the entire property is \u201csmoke-free.\u201d There is also a nice oceanfront art-deco restaurant on the hotel property. In addition, a multi-level parking garage is located just across from the front lobby. Speaking of lobby, both the front and side lobbies are beautifully decorated. A gift shop and small convenience store are both located in the lobby. As in my past Princess Royale TripAdvisor reviews, I\u2019ve saved the best for last \u2013 the Atrium with Olympic-size swimming pool and large Jacuzzi. We\u2019re not talking a small swimming pool as with some other O.C. hotels such as the Courtyard by Marriott or The Dunes Manor. This is the real-deal. No matter what the weather or time of the year, you can enjoy the fantastic swimming pool and Atrium at Princess Royale. Oh, did I mention that the O.C. Hilton Suites does not have an indoor Jacuzzi in the swimming pool area? There are also two pool-side sauna\u2019s, a seasonal indoor pool bar and lots of arcade games and machines for the children inside the Princess Royale Atrium. If desired, you can book a suite with a pool/Atrium view. For those businesses looking for meeting space, one-half of the Atrium can accommodate business luncheons and even wedding receptions! In addition, just outside the Atrium is a large oceanfront deck with two small Jacuzzi\u2019s. Okay, I\u2019m giving away my best secret here \u2013 the package deals at Princess Royale. During off-season, the resort offers deals in which you get a free night if you stay on a certain day of the week such as a Friday (Thursday free) or Saturday (Sunday free). Yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 a free night! What other O.C. hotel offers such a great deal? There are numerous summer vacation package deals in which guests also receive either a free night, or 50%-off room, free breakfast buffet and even gasoline coupons to help get you to Ocean City, Maryland. Just check the website at: www.princessroyale.com for all the details and vacation packages. Another great aspect of Princess Royale is that during off-season, based on availability you may receive a free upgrade on your accommodations (i.e., oceanview to oceanfront). You might even be lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the 30 magnificent and spacious two and three-bedroom condominiums on the property. No other O.C. hotel is this generous in upgrading guest accommodations. So, take it from us \u2013 Princess Royale is the place to stay while vacationing in Ocean City, MD, or just enjoying a long 3-day weekend or holiday. This resort blows away the competition and their rates for comparable accommodations cannot be beat. As one who has been going to O.C. all my life and stayed at numerous hotels \u2013 Princess Royale has become our #1 top choice. Oh, there\u2019s a SuperFresh grocery store just across Coastal Highway from the hotel. What more can a traveler ask for in an Ocean City, Maryland, hotel or motel?

We just left, having spent Friday and Saturday of this Memorial Weekend. Once we were able to check into our room on Friday around 3:00 p.m., we were pleasantly suprised by its size. We stayed in an ocean/pool view one bedroom king. It was very clean, had separate living room, dinette, full kitchen from the sleeping area. Our balcony overlooked the pool area. The first thing I must mention is that the pool area DID NOT HAVE A BAD SMELL. It smelled like a chlorinated pool should smell and it was in NO WAY overwhelming. Everything in our room was clean -- no molds, no smells, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. There was a bedroom door, which when closed, gave an excellent noise barrier to anything going on in the hall. We were never disturbed by hall noise and heard only one loud door closure during our entire trip. Now, I must say that there are cheaper rooms available at the Princess Royale, however, they are actually attached to the parking structure which faces Coastal Highway and is across from the main structure. I would venture to guess that any bad experiences may actually have come from staying in these rooms. Even for a value, I would not recommend them. The pool is fairly large, with an inside jacuzzi, two outside jacuzzis and two hot saunas. The hours of the pool were strictly regulated from 10am to 10pm. This meant no late noise from partiers and even the noise during normal hours was very reasonable, and when we had the TV on, you couldn't even hear it. The beach access was literally right out the back door, and five steps from the path was a beach umbrella and chair rental company. For $35 plus tip, we got a large beach umbrella and two fully reclinable beach chairs for the day set up for us. That was such a great convenience so we didn't have to put sandy equipment in our nice car. Please note that you cannot remove towels from the rooms or from the pool area to use at the beach so please remember to bring your own!!!! Although it was a busy weekend, we never felt really crowded on the beach and the sand was soft and clean. Our only negative comments are regarding their breakfast buffet and the parking situation. For such a nice hotel, which had been recently renovated and looked nearly brand new, the buffet was SEVERELY disappointing and grossly overpriced. It was sold as only $9.95, however, our juice and coffee, which we assumed was included, cost an additional $5.90 each. The eggs were dry, the sausuage was EXTREMELY greasy, and they only had melons as fruit, some dry breads and muffins and a few kinds of cereal. Knowing what I know now, I will go across the street to the Super Fresh grocery store and get food to cook myself, which is what we did for lunch -- making turkey sandwiches and bringing water and powerade in our cooler to the beach. Also, there is a Burger King and McDonalds a short distance up the street. We chose that for our Sunday breakfast, and that was less than half as much and left us just as full. When we checked in, we were given a parking pass and told that only hotel patrons could park in their structure, however, we found over half the cars had no passes and parking was pretty sparse. We always found a spot, even if it was close to the top, but we felt that the attention paid towards making sure that their guests had a place to park was lacking. Would we go back again? ABSOLUTELY!! In fact, we are coming back in September, and have asked for our same room on the fifth floor once again, as it fit our needs perfectly and was a fantastic value.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "England, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201clousy and way too expensive.....\u201d", "Author": "na n", "ReviewID": "UR130645804", "Content": "staff was fair, except maids, they were very disturbing and noisey. unprofessional...this place is way overpriced and inconvenient to smokers.... way too pricey and noisey. elevators and parking not good accomidations at all unless you're loaded with cash for any kind of services....bellman were fair. checkout desk unpleasant.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jeffersonville, PA", "Title": "\u201c4 day getaway!!!\u201d", "Author": "LenoreB1117", "ReviewID": "UR130494036", "Content": "We started our vacation on a Wednesday evening, just jumped in the truck and started to drive!

I am a passive person and easily satisfied, but this hotel was TERRIBLE!!!! Although the Princess Royale hotel is not the worst place I have stayed, it could have been better. My husband and I stayed for three nights in hopes of a nice getaway. We stayed in the off season (3rd week of march) because it was quiet and we wanted a nice ocean view. We booked a kind suite with an ocean view, supposedly. When we got to our room, our \"ocean view\" was really a look into the condo's across the street, but if we turned our head sideways and peered down the street, we could see a few feet of ocean. We were told we had an ocean view so what was the problem. I chose this hotel because it offered room service, ocean view suites, a convenience store and a resturant. Since we didn't get the view we had hoped for, we checked out our room, which had a strange smell, we later decided was mildew from the bathroom not having a fan. Without a fan all the steam from the shower has not place to go. This also could explain why the 1990's pink wallpaper was bubbling and pulling away from the walls. The carpet was in bad need of updating, as well as the couch and chairs, all were worn and faded and had that same smell. The kitchen was sufficient, but the dishwasher had standing water in it, from being installed wrong, and the ice maker wouldn't shut off so at 3 in the morning I kept being woken up by what I thought was knocking at the door. The bed was the only great part of the stay, sleep was good. Our first night we went out to dinner and enjoyed the city but decided to order room service the next morning for breakfast. To our dismay we put out our card, but the next morning there was no food. We then decided to head downstairs to the resturant, figuring maybe someone dropped the ball. There was a note on the door than read, \"Closed until Wednesday\" as was the store and gift shop. WHAT??? I booked the hotel for all of these amenities and they are all closed from Sunday to Wednesday....? When we spoke with the front desk they told us the hotel capacity was below the amount they needed to keep these amenities open, so \"tough luck\". Of course they apologized for the room service, but said there were plenty of places in town to eat. Of course we asked to speak with management, but were told no managers were available, I guess they don't work either when the hotel drops below a certain capacity. Disappointed and ticked off we decided to go for a little swim, only to find out the pool, despite clearly posted hours, was closed off. Then we got told they had to put in a handicap ramp so they apologized for the trouble. None of this is my problem.....I paid for a hotel with special amenities and didn't get to enjoy ANY of them. The staff was ignorant, the rooms were mildewed and outdated, I've had better showers at the gym, and better views at worse hotels. We will never, NEVER, stay at the Princess Royale AGAIN!!!!

This was noticed the 2nd day into our trip, in the afternoon. All they offered, ( the office manager/a guy ) was to spray our room and change our bedding, and extend our stay from an 11 am checkout to 5pm. WTH? Next day we awoke to more bugs.

The regular suites were nicer, bigger, more spacious... if you aren't into the jacuzzi thing, go for the suite! The jacuzzi room I had at Oceanside resort was rather sad, the handle to the jacuzzi fell off, and the jacuzzi needed to be upgraded The jacuzzi room at the Bayside resort was cleaner and in better shape, however our overall room location left a lot to be desired for a romantic getaway. The balcony view was a dirty rooftop. But hey, a bottle of wine, darkness, love, and we didn't really care if the rooftop view was dismal. Walking distance to various eating places. Oceanside resort has an indoor pool with noisy children. You will want to make sure you don't get a room that fronts the pool area, or has your balcony near the pool, unless you have kids and want to keep an eye on them! Ask for rooms higher up in the hotel floor level if you want some privacy away from kids.

You can't see the ocean while in teh lounge chairs due to the dune, but the sky, palm trees and breeze were all lovely. The bayside resort is nice too.

My husband could get up early and I wasn't disturbed. The new flat screen TV in the bedroom was great. The facilities were a little dated also. But very nice. I think an updated decor would really be good. Parking was a breeze with their own parking garage. The staff was very nice and the bar and restaraunt were good also.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germantown, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cAbove Average - Well Priced\u201d", "Author": "Brian G", "ReviewID": "UR125087665", "Content": "We just spent our 2nd straight Valentine's Day in one of Princess Royale's jacuzi suites.

The lobby looks pretty and elegant. Our room had a small kitchenette included with refrigerator and microwave. It was stocked with dishes, glasses, silverware, etc. Down the hall there was a soda machine. This was a one night stay. This room had a king-size bed which was fairly comfortable. The jacuzzi was heart shaped, very uncomfortable and it leaked. We had brought wine to enjoy as well as a couple of sodas. We looked for an ice bucket and found none. Upon going down to the room with the soda machine, I found there was no ice machine! When I called down to the desk, they said this huge, allegedly fancy hotel didn't have an ice machine in it! They directed us to the freezer of the refrigerator, but there was no ice made in there when we arrived and by the time it would have been ready it would have been too late for us to use. The only thing I can conclude from this is this hotel is not interested in people only staying one night! I have never in my entire life (and I am almost 60) stayed in a hotel totally devoid of ice machines! Also, when we called the desk for extra pillows, I was first asked, \"How many do you have?\" They refused to give us any until I let them know and then said they would give us two more. We also had difficulty getting more towels. The people at the desk were rude, full of attitude and downright stingy. You would think that a hotel that looked so inviting had such an attractive ambiance would treat their guests in a more welcoming and cordial manner. Not so. Between the total lack of ice machines, the leaking jacuzzi and the attitude of the staff, I would never, ever go back there. Needless to say, I do not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFirst Time at Princess Royale\u201d", "Author": "T D", "ReviewID": "UR124273157", "Content": "I coordinated a youth retreat in Ocean City for a weekend.

We're talking a span of six decades and hundreds of trips. However, it was only within the past couple years that I happened upon The Princess Royale Resort while surfing the Internet looking for a change of venue. Upon discovering this \"Jewel\" of Ocean City, my husband and I now stay exclusively at Princess Royale for weekend and holiday get-a-ways. Having stayed at numerous other Ocean City, MD, hotels such as The Dunes Manor, Hilton Suites Oceanfront, Courtyard by Marriott, The Grand, Best Western and others, we would not consider staying anywhere else but at Princess Royale. What more can a vacationer ask for? Many hotel rooms are oceanfront and others are oceanview and atrium/pool view. All standard accommodations comprise full-size suites (with two 32\" LCD flatscreen TV's; comfortably-furnished living room with sofabed; large kitchen (complimentary coffee) with all modern appliances, dishware, glassware, silverware, cookware and granite countertops; dinette area; bathroom with mirrored vanity and granite countertop; spacious bedroom with King or Queen-size Tempur-pedic beds (voted #1 mattress in America), and balcony/deck in most all suites. Personally, I love the soft, comfortable and warm microfiber blankets on all the beds. Of course, you can upgrade your accommodations to a King-Jacuzzi suite, or two and three-bedroom condos. Oh, don\u2019t think about swiping the bathroom towels because they have a security sensor. Princess Royale has two spectacular lobbies and most all amenities such as a free health club (spa service available); business center; free WiFi (great connectivity); convenience store; gift shop; valet parking; arcade and much more! You will find that the rates are very affordable and wipes out the competition. I'm saving the best for last -- the four-story oceanfront glass atrium with Olympic-size indoor swimming pool! Hey, I'm giving away my best secrets here. The pool area also has a large indoor Jacuzzi and saunas. Just outside the atrium is a sundeck with two small hot tubs. The inside atrium area is very large and can accommodate special events such as wedding receptions and business meetings/luncheons. Schooners Restaurant/lounge is located oceanfront within the hotel if you want a quick meal/buffet and don't wish to leave the premises. Nice, cozy ambiance! There is a horseshoe driveway at the lobby entrance for registration. Bellcart service is available. If you wish to use a bellcart, a Bellman must take your luggage to your room. A multi-level parking garage (free parking) with elevator is located just across from the hotel lobby. We have never had any issues with finding a parking space. Princess Royale boasts 310 two-room suites and 30 two/three bedroom condos. I believe Princess Royale to be the largest resort in Ocean City, Maryland. Okay, I've been holding out on you. There are some great package deals to be had at Princess Royale (during off-season). Check out their website at: www.princessroyale.com. During the off-season, you might even get lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the condos. I\u2019m not sure about the methodology of an upgrade, but I\u2019ll take it if my name is pulled out of the hat. I would also like to add that Princess Royale has a great management staff. In addition, the hotel has recently undergone renovations to include all new hotel room doors and hardware, plus new hallway carpeting. We were fortunate on a few occasions to be on the receiving end of an upgrade which was very much appreciated. Once, I was recovering from knee surgery and enjoyed the spacious, well-appointed accommodations. It was so nice to be able to enjoy the condo since I couldn\u2019t get out much due to stitches in my knee. During our last stay (January 28-30, 2012), we received a condo upgrade which really lifted my spirits, as I was headed to the hospital upon check-out for a hip surgical procedure. Timing is everything! One thing I have read on TripAdvisor.com is that some folks have issues with having to take two elevators to the condo section of the resort. Even with stitches in my knee and on crutches, I had no issues with the longer hallway walk and utilizing two elevators. Believe me, if you're lucky enough to receive a condo upgrade, it's well worth the extra steps. In closing, this review doesn't cover everything the Princess Royale Resort has to offer, so check out their website for the full details. (No, I am not an employee or agent of the hotel). I should mention that a Superfresh grocery store is conveniently located just across Coastal Highway from Princess Royale, along with Roses Department Store for those last minute travel items. Enjoy your stay at The Princess Royale Resort -- we have and will continue to do so for many more years to come! \"Life's a Beach.\"", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPrincess Royale winter vacation\u201d", "Author": "Peggyfrank", "ReviewID": "UR124258385", "Content": "My husband and I took a mid winter vacation at the Princess Royale.It was my husband's Birthday and our 23rd anniversary.

My son loved looking out the window down to the pool, and loved the balcony as well. check-in and out were easy. One complaint, you can only use a cart or get info from the guys out front if you will be using them for valet, otherwise, they didn't care what questions you had. I understand making money but they create the initial experience as you enter the hotel so it would be good for them to be more positive and attentive. We reluctanly visited the restaurant for dinner (buffet) and it was not the worse we have had but very close to it. NOT WORTH A DIME TO GO TO THAT BUFFET EVER AGAIN.

My son did well but we were always afraid of him falling in his sleep. The hotel was filled with people but was still calm and quiet, a little getaway.

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast - and the view - and would have to say our only disappointment was the $2.50 charge for coffee, which we felt was excessive since it was added to the breakfast price and we were not informed of that prior to ordering. Seems a rather silly idea to cause ill-will for an overpriced beverage - better to increase the price of the buffet and include the coffee. Rooms were clean, nicely equipped and the beds were a treat. Our entire weekend stay reminded us of being on a cruise - and we can pay no higher compliment than that.

Is this place ever dated! I felt like I was living in a Miami Vice scene. Anyway, once I got past the \"decor\" I will say that the place was convienient and good for families. We stayed in a suite on pool level that included a master bedroom with a king-size bed and a living room area with a pull-out sofa, on which my 12-year-old and 9-year-old slept. So, it worked out pretty well for the 4 of us. Our oldest (16 years old) was unable to be with us on this vacation and having had experience with 3-kid vacations I would say this place would have been cramped with our family of 5. If someone had 3 very young kids it would probably be okay. With the sofa pulled out there was not much floor space left. The room was pretty clean, considering it's peach and green decor. There were 2 TVs in the room and they both were NOT flat screens, which I would think should be standard these days. The king-size bed was very comfy. The pool was so-so. The kids liked it but it was crowded and the water was cloudy. The pool area had arcade games that my kids liked. From pool level you could walk down steps to the beach, so it was very convenient. Parking was in a garage, which was a good escape from parking in full sun. The \"package\" deal we got online included breakfast daily. It was nothing to rave about...pretty mediocre and the same thing every day--waffles, eggs, potatoes, fruit--cafeteria-style food like you would expect at a conference ceter, which this place pretty much is in the off season. There was a stove, refridgerator, dishwasher, and microwave in the room. We only used the fridge for drinks. For the price and location, I would go back because, in my opinion, compared to other beach places, it would rank above average.

Although we've driven through OC several times and have camped at Assateaque Island, this was our first time overnighting in Ocean City. We selected this hotel due to the good TripAdvisor reviews and also a coupon for a free night on the hotel's website (make sure to check there if you are staying off season!). Anyway, on to the review: The Good: - Super-friendly and helpful staff. Really impressive! For big hotels like this I usually assume that service and staff attitudes will be poor. Everyone we dealt with was helpful and friendly and seemed genuinely concerned that we have a nice stay. - Our oceanfront suite was nicely appointed, roomy, and clean. Temper-Pedic mattresses were a nice touch and were very comfortable. Full kitchen including a full-size refrigerator and a small dishwasher (with provided dishwasher soap, too). - The view and the beach. Our second-floor room overlooked a row of palm trees and then the beach, making for a view that was more Caribbean than Maryland. Very relaxing! Since it was off season the beach was very quiet and uncrowded. - Parking was readily available both on side streets and in their parking garage. - This place really is a true resort with lots of guest amenities. An amazing indoor pool complex under a giant atrium, complete with a pool bar/snack stand, sauna, game area with both video and regular games (ping-pong, etc.), and outdoor hot tubs. On a rainy day this atrium pool area would be a godsend with a family! The Negatives While I can't come up with any significant negatives, there are some things to comment on: - Pricing seems a bit high for off season. Thankfully we used a coupon that gave a free Sunday night with a Saturday night stay. But our Saturday night stay pushed $200 with tax, resulting in an acceptable per-night cost of $100 with the coupon. If we had paid full price for both nights I'd say it was not worth it given other off-season prices in OC. - Decor in public spaces is a bit dated design-wise, but it is not run-down or shabby. Really just a taste thing rather than a negative. - The restaurant was OK. We ate breakfast there (buffet), which was just average for its $10 price (not including drinks). A bit outdated looking, but a great view of the ocean. Service was a bit slow. Our second day we had a better breakfast at a much better price at the Denny's restaurant a few blocks north. - While the resort and the beach are great, be aware that the location isn't near too much else. You could easily spend the entire week there and not have to venture outside the resort, though. But if you want to check out other restaurants, the boardwalk, etc., it's a bit of a trip by car and definitely not walkable. - This comment doesn't relate to the hotel, but to OC in general: we were left unimpressed by OC, feeling it was too built-up and citylike for our tastes. Also, restaurant prices were very high across the board, which was surprising. We expect a bit higher prices in a resort area, but OC restaurants seem to have passed into the realm of price gouging.

Check-in went smoothly with only one little blip that was quickly corrected. The bell captain was quick to unload our car and entertained us with trivia as he showed us to our room. Yes, it is a long walk through the halls and you do have to take two elevators, but we have stayed at other resorts with equally long or longer walks that were outside, so walking the long hallway really wasn't anything to complain about. Our condo exceeded our expectations. It was nicely decorated and well-maintained. Furnishings were very comfortable, especially in the living room. Kitchen had everything anyone could need for a long stay although the only thing we used was the coffeemaker and coffee cups. The master bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable king bed, bathroom with a garden tub (didn't soak in the tub) and a terrific shower head, and large window facing the ocean as well as a patio door to the balcony. The second bedroom had two beds -- I think they may have been doubles, not queens, but I'm not certain. In addition, there is a pantry, coat closet (in the dining room), and a utility closet with a washer and dryer. There is ample drawer space for a family's belongings for a week and plenty of room for everyone to spread out. All of the staff that we encountered at Princess Royale were courteous and helpful. Housekeeping did their job well. We only had one minor issue with housekeeping and that is that we were not left any regular coffee for our last morning. Decaf just doesn't work for my husband. Since we were going out to breakfast any way, I didn't bother to request some regular coffee to be sent up. For the first time in all our visits, I used the pool. The entire pool area was clean, the music playing was wonderful, and the water was a perfect temperature. Very few people used the pool even though three of our four days there were not beach days (too cold). When we used it, no one else was there. Post-season maintenance and repairs were going on in several locations during our stay but this in no way intruded upon us. The second floor doors and hallway trim were being painted and windows in the pool area were being replaced. I noticed some other exterior work also being done.

In previous years, we generally stayed at The Dunes Manor Hotel and had decided it was time for a change (for the better). The Princess Royale does not disappoint! Why stay in a small one-room hotel such as The Dunes Manor, when you can stay at The Princess Royale where all rooms are suites and in which the rates are generally lower for comparable accommodations? It's not rocket science. After our first stay at Princess Royale I fell in love with their Tempur-Pedic mattresses. When I got home, I bought one despite the expense. Few hotels anywhere offer such comfortable and therapeutic mattresses. The big draw card for us at any hotel are the pool facilities. Again, Princess Royale does not disappoint with an Olympic-size swimming pool and large Jacuzzi set inside a huge atrium. There are also two smaller outdoor oceanfront Jacuzzi's (seasonal). We stayed in an oceanfront double-Queen suite. Considering this was the last weekend of summer and the hotel had been pounded all summer by guests the suite was in near immaculate condition. The only complaint I have is that the pillows are too flat and uncomfortable. Not much to complain about, right? Everything else was great. The living room area is spacious with a sofa bed and lounge chair. There are two granite end tables with lamps, a pole lamp and granite coffee table. There is also a large credenza with drawers with a TV on top. Having a full kitchen is such a treat. The kitchen counters are granite. The full-size refrigerator (with ice-maker) is great for storing those large milk cartons and all your other refrigerated food and beverages. You don't have to bend down over those small refrigerators supplied at most hotels. There is a nice granite breakfast nook table area and two chairs with ceiling lamp. We enjoyed some cheese, crackers, caviar and fruit as a late-night snack at the breakfast nook. The kitchen is equipped with dishes, silverware, pots and pans and 4-cup coffee maker. We would have liked an 8-cup for brewing the Starbucks coffee we brought, but you can't have everything. No prob. There is also a large above-counter microwave. The sink even has a garbage disposal. I love the large granite bathroom countertops which have ample space for all the toiletries I bring along when traveling. The shower nozzle has good water pressure. The towels could be a little more plush, but I'm not complaining. The oceanfront bedroom has a large credenza with draws and a 32-inch plasma-screen TV on top. The suite did not have a DVD player and although we brought a portable one, we could not connect it to the other two TV's in the room. Again, no biggie. There is a large closet in the bedroom and also a lounge chair and pole lamp. The floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall sliding glass balcony doors allows ample morning sunshine to brighten the room. You can sit on the patio chairs and enjoy the sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean. It doesn't get much better than that. We were lucky enough to see a pod of Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins migrating south during our stay at the hotel as we sipped our coffee on the patio. There are many more amenities too numerous to mention, but suffice to say The Princess Royale is now our new O.C. \"Home Away From Home.\" The hotel rooms are clean, well-appointed, spacious and comfortable. The Housekeeper was friendly and thorough. The cozy oceanfront \"Schooners\" Restaurant is located on the premises which we find convenient when we don't wish to venture out for a meal. What more can you ask for without paying an arm and a leg for a hotel room such as with the O.C. Hilton Suites? (Been there, done that). You can always find parking in the multi-level garage just across the driveway from the hotel lobby. Bell-Hops can assist with your luggage, although we prefer to cart our own gear to the hotel room. Check-in at the Front Desk has always been a breeze. I'm so glad we found The Princess Royale Resort for our many O.C. stays throughout each year.

We knew it was a pool view (we were on the 5th floor), however, we weren't expecting there to be a conference/dinner in the pool area one evening. A dinner buffet was served in the pool court and there was a podium set up for speakers to make statements. Unfortunately, the speakers and noise continued until after 9pm. The noise was very audible in our room and made it difficult for our daughter to sleep. The room also constantly smelled like the pool and there was no way to get fresh air in the room.

We have three small boys, and with the indoor pool, arcade/game area and of course with the ocean just steps away, it's the perfect place for us. This is our second time staying at the Princess. The first time we stayed in an ocean view room, and while you can \"view\" the ocean, the balcony is very small. We're a value-conscious family, and for our most recent stay, we booked the room months in advance to take advantage of the $100 Princess Bucks deal for a 5-night stay in an oceanview suite. To our surprise at check-in, they upgraded us to an oceanfront room for the same price as an oceanview room. It was really nice having the larger balcony overlooking the ocean. While my wife was inside with the baby, she could look out on the beach to see me playing with the other two. If you can swing it, it's worth the extra cost to get an oceanfront room. We also like having a kitchen in the room to cut down on food costs. We did our grocery shopping across the street at the Super Fresh on 94th street, and spent less than $100 for the 5 nights/4 days we were there. The only downsides to staying at this hotel are: 1. You have to drive pretty far to get to the boardwalk, but if you only plan to go there 1 or 2 times during your stay, then it's not a big deal. Parking near the boardwalk is $1/hour at a meter down one of the side streets if your lucky enough to find a spot, also the cheapest, at the inlet if somethings not going on (i.e. Sunfest), a little bit more, or $10-$20/day at a private lot. You can also catch a bus to eliminate the drive altogether. The bus only costs $3 for an all day pass, and children under 42\" are free. 2. The parking spots in the garage are a little tight, but that's the norm for most of the ocean hotels I've been to. We have a minivan with the sliding side doors, so it wasn't a problem for us, but if you have a big SUV or truck, you may find it a bit of a squeeze.

Upon arrival we got into our room around 3pm which was about an hour early. Within the first hour we realized that our A/C didn't work, we called the Front Desk and someone was to our room in 15 minutes. Our A/C was fixed in 5 minutes, compressor tripped. A few hours later we discovered that out toilet wouldn't flush, called the Front Desk and again, 15 minutes later they were there with a new fill valve. We then discovered that the ice maker didn't work, we went and bought ice. The shower valves have the wrong stems and all the knobs turn backwards, but the shower head was fantastic ,.., like a turbo shower. The bathroom sink drain was real slow. They advertise 32\" TV in the bedroom and yes it was there but no HD. You know how a TV looks with poor service, the aspect ratio was all wacky. The one in the livingroom looked to be about worn out and the picture wasn't real good. The pool area was great, inside hot tub, 2 saunas, inside bar, everything was well kept. The outside bar is closed this time of year and the outside hot tubs although open, were only 89 degrees and low on water.

She also lifted up one of the 4 pillows. She then pointed out that there were no bugs. We insisted on another room and got it. When we checked out the following morning we asked the woman behind the counter if we could get a copy of our bill (we didn't want to be billed for oceanfront the second night). Still without a word to us, she printed the bill... she didn't ask how our stay was. So I told her our stay was really bad. I pulled my hair back and showed her my neck. She told us \"I'm not a doctor\". I wasn't looking for medical advise... I just wanted my complaint to be told to a manager so the room could be treated for bedbugs or spiders. My husband & I left immediately... we both knew it would be futile to talk to this woman.The disrespect that this woman treated us with was the reason I called a few days later. I asked for and spoke to a manager. I didn't know until that conversation that the woman who checked us out was also a manager. Incredible! The 2nd manager that I spoke to could not understand why I was calling. She went into a diatribe (reading from comments on her computer) of company policy and how the bites happened. She repeatedly told me that it either happened on the beach or mosquito's on my 4th floor balcony. She insisted that was how it happened. I asked by who's authority was it certain that that was the cause? Her answer was... \"that's what's written in your files comments\". As I told her, my neck was fine when I got in that bed on Sunday night... and it was bitten when I got out of it Monday morning. I also told her about the first managers comment \"I'm not a doctor\" and the 2nd manager actually told me \"well that's not written in the comments\". I then asked her why the 1st manager would even make written comment on a negative statement that she, herself made!! Another incredible!! I then emailed yet another manager who claimed all of it was a \"simple misunderstanding\". She went on to say that she hoped my experience wouldn't influence my decision to go back to that hotel.

We watched dolphins and parasailing from our balcony. The room was clean, the beds were very comfortable (memory foam mattresses) and the kitchen was handy. Lighting in the bathroom could be better and the sofa bed was uncomfortable (although it makes the room a good value because more people can occupy without sharing beds.) When we checked into our room, the icemaker hadn't been turned on in our freezer. There were no ice machines on the floor, although the vending machines were well-stocked. When I explained to the front desk & asked where to get ice, they sent me \"over the river and through the woods\" to the restaurant to fetch it myself, rather than offering to bring some to the room. The food in the restaurant was good quality; however when we got the breakfast buffet, I asked if they could make an egg to order and after a lengthy check, they were going to charge me an additional $4.95 for one egg! At other resorts, that's normally complimentary if only scrambled eggs are offered on the buffet. The indoor restaurant service could've been better and we were wishing the Sunday brunch would be available earlier in the morning. The beachside dining and bar is a definite plus (better service too!) and is landscaped nicely with palm trees, etc. The resort is very conveniently located on the beach - but bring your own towels, they don't provide them. A rental station for beach chairs and umbrellas is right next to the beach entrance and the service is wonderful. We went early to claim a spot on the beach and the rental agent carried the gear to our location, set it up, dragged it back in for us when it started raining and set it back up shortly after the rain stopped - totally worth not having to cart your own stuff around! The enclosed pool area is very nice & a safe bet in case it decides to rain during your stay (you never know). I suggest utilizing the available vallet parking UNDER the building - they've never had any problems with theft or vandalism there, since it's more secure than the outdoor parking garage. The vallets are very helpful and polite. Bus stops are postioned close to the resort. Outdoor lighting around the parking garage on the way to the bus stops could be enhanced, but we didn't feel unsafe. All in all, a great place to stay in Ocean City and a good value!

The tub had mold in it covered by silicone - completely visible. The toilet was grimy. Just looking at it, mold/grime was visible under the rim. My bowl at home is always spotless...a toilet brush and lysol toilet cleaner should do the trick (just a hint to the management who oversees housekeeping). The beach was great. However...overall, for the price of this place you're paying strictly for the ocean front part of it all. The rooms are dated. Perhaps renovations to the kitchen area and new tub/toilet/tiles should do the trick. For the price, you would expect cleaner bathrooms. I would have to pay all that money and be grossed out of having to give my toddler a bath in that tub. Please have someone look into this and periodically spot check rooms.

So I am not sure how these compare to the other rooms and not sure if my reviews apply to those. Pros: - Check in was easy and quick. - Rooms are neat and clean - Can not beat the location for the cabanas. You open your door and walk out onto the grass lawn by the outdoor bar. Just steps away from the beach access. No waiting for elevators or going up and down stairs to get to the beach. When traveling with little kids and Dad has to haul all equipment to and from the beach, the access is invaluable. - Beds are very comfortable - Live music in the afternoons we good Cons: - AC unit could not keep up with the heat. I think it was something to do with the level because as soon as you moved from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor where the cabanas are, the increase in tempurature is significant. We could feel heat radiating from the floor tiles and the AC just could not keep the room cool enough. - Kitchenette is basicaly useless. This is related to the AC prblem because if you attempt to cook or heat food in the microwave, the AC (located in the bedroom) can not keep up and it made the heat even worse. We didn't expect to cook gormet meals there, but at least whip up something for kids and adults for breakfast and lunch if neeeded So instead of saving some cash and eating in on occaision, we had to eat out every meal. - Pool was disgusting: The pictures shows nice, clear blue water in the pool. When we arrived it was a cloudy, yellowish-green. It may have been better if the hotel chose to provide more oversight on cleanliness. They allowed a group of people who had just arrived, but unable to check in to thier rooms, to enter the pool fully attired in street clothes!! - Avoid the hotel restaurants. Expensive for less the average quality. We only ate breakfast there once, but I figured if they can't get breakfast right then I don't even want to try anything else. For fine dinning go to Liquid Assets across the highway. For breakfast go to the restaurant next door (can't remember the name. - Weird design: To get from the first floor cabanas to the front desk on the first floor, you have to take an elevator to the 2nd floor, walk across the entire 2nd floor, then go back down to the 1st floor.

I prefer the Hilton or Holiday Inn Suites but we had a last minute trip and they were both booked and I am very scared of many of the Ocean City hotels so we tried the Princess Royale and I was pleasantly suprised. This hotel is very nice for the most part. The rooms are suites with a living area, small kitchen, bathroom and separate bedroom area. For the most part this hotel is pretty clean. The rooms could definitely use some new furniture and some updating, I was actually affraid to sit on the couch it looked dirty. It had a kitchen area with a full refrigerator and it was pretty clean but outdated. The bathroom was nice and very clean. The bedroom area was very clean and the beds are absolutely WONDERFUL! They are temperpedic and very very comfortable. I have stayed here twice and quickly learned to research the room type before booking. Even though your room may have a balcony some of the balconies are not outside, they are within the pool atrium so you really can't see the beach and its not fresh air. The hotel has lots of great ammenities and is very family oriented. It is a completely smoke free hotel, you cannot even smoke on the balconies and for me this is nice because I am a non-smoker but friends of ours did not want to stay here because they wanted to be allowed to smoke outside. Some of the hallways need some fresh paint and new carpeting but that really is not a big deal. The thing that disappoints me most about this hotel is that there is no outdoor pool at all. There is a very nice indoor pool but during the hot summer months it is VERY hot and you can't see the beach, hear the ocean waves or get a suntan. There is a very small deck outside the pool area for sunbathing but not many people can fit out there and you have to go inside to get into the pool. Overall this is a pretty nice place to stay and I would definitely stay again because it has reasonable prices for the OC area but it definitely needs a facelift and it would be really nice to have an outdoor pool.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood time, but??\u201d", "Author": "mugsey1967", "ReviewID": "UR115905932", "Content": "We recently came back from this resort, but we feel that there should be some upgrading requirements, such as there is no a/c in each of their elevators, the hallway carpeting was not at all apealing due to wear and staining throughout.

We currently have a five year old and a three year old. We love the indoor pool and hottub area. The view from all of their side oceanview rooms is wonderful. We also love the fact that all of the rooms are suites. We are able to put our little ones to bed at a normal time and continue to enjoy the evening in the \"living\" room. We also like the full size fridge and kitchen area so that we don't need to eat out for every meal. This is definitely a family friendly place. But at the same time, my parents who are in their sixties also are able to enjoy the hotel. It is not at all noisy. They even have family nights on Thursdays with kid-friendly movies on the beach. The hotel is far enough away from the crazier areas of Ocean City, but close enough that you can get to the boardwalk and other fun things easily. The hotel is very clean. The staff is also polite and friendly. The hotel food is overall good and not too expensive. The biggest downside to the Princess Royale is that it is hard to get to the beach. You need to travel through the pool area and down a set of steep stairs that can be slippery when they are covered in water or sand. (A staff member is ALWAYS there sweeping.) This is a bit scary when your arms are full of beach items and you have two little ones with you. There is also an elevator to go down, but then you need to walk through the restaurant. However in my mind this is not a big enough problem to keep me from coming back next year. Overall, this is a wonderful, clean, family - oriented hotel. Not to mention that the beds are super comfy!

(It wasn't what I went looking for, but was the last oceanfront room left with a king-sized bed. While a little smaller than the other suites and without a couch sitting area, we still enjoyed the room. Because it was on the corner, we had large windows on two sides of the room. We were able to open the sliding glass doors on both walls and let a wonderful ocean breeze come through. Lying in bed you could look out one way into the ocean, and the other to see up the beach. The room had a full-sized refrigerator with an ice maker, a stovetop with two burners, a dish washer, and a full complement of pots, pans, dishes, and silverware. This made it very convenient to cook breakfast and quick lunches in the room. The decor is a little dated. (The lobby screams 1980's!) We also took note that the chairs at the kitchenette in our room were cheap plastic patio-type furniture, and the rug and other furniture in the room were a little worn. I will say, though, that everything was incredibly clean. Each day, it was evident that the maid spent a good deal of time servicing our room and paying close attention to detail. We tried to avoid doing so, but knew we tracked a lot of sand into the room. Somehow, there never seemed to be a trace of it the next day after the maid service. There was no skimping on the most important piece of furniture in the room -- the bed. It was an incredibly comfortable tempur-pedic mattress. The linens were soft and fit the bed well. (Unlike so many hotels where the sheets are like sandpaper and pull out before morning, these were very nice.) The hotel sits right on the beach. We'd go down in the morning and set up our chairs and umbrella, enjoy the ocean and beach, and then retreat back to the hotel when the heat (or hunger) would get to us. There is a bar both at the beach and by the pool. There are convenient places to shower off the sand. We'd shower, swim in the pool for a while, enjoy a drink at the bar, or head up to our room to make lunch. Then, we'd be right back down on the beach. We could see our chairs and umbrella from our balcony, so knew no one was bothering them. The hotel offers a seafood buffet in their banquet room. We tried this one evening and were very impressed. We actually enjoyed it more than the Phillip's Buffet we went to the next night. We purchased a package that included dinner and the comedy club, and enjoyed the show. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant the morning we checked out was also enjoyable.

This is our 4th trip to Princess Royale and we've stayed in various rooms. We really enjoyed the 3 bedroom condo last Easter but opted to be by the pool this time since the walking distance was pretty far in the condo and with children, convenience is important. We were in rooms 211 and 213 and neither of the back stove-top burners worked. We felt the hallway carpeting and walls are looking pretty dated, there weren't enough washers and dryers and the dryers didn't seem to get very hot. We were pleasantly surprised that the gameroom shut down at 11pm because prior visits made the noise level unbearable. Unlike our 3 previous visits, the pool was very warm this time and a nice surprise. The parking garage is a little less desirable on busy holiday weekends because the elevator is slow and the top floor's white paint is blinding. We had booked our rooms in Feb and requested a particular area but when we arrived, they had us about 9 rooms apart. Seems no matter what hotel we book at though, no desk attendant ever bothers to looks at special requests so if you don't speak up, your request may not be granted, We waited an extra two hrs to have rooms side by side but we were thankful to use the facilities while we waited. I think Princess Royale makes a concerted effort to have something for everyone but the one thing I think would be a great asset would be to add a children's play area in the grass by the bar area. The beach down on the boardwalk has a few wooden play areas and this would have topped our vacation! We could have opted to have a drink while our children played :) Anyway, we always enjoy our stay but things seem to need refurbished soon.

The reservation was made several months in advance and was confirmed with an email invoice. I inquired about the free night at check-in and the desk clerk stated it would be taken care of at check-out. However, at check out the desk clerk only asked if I wanted to keep the balance on the same credit card, but did not state the amount (which I found to be a little strange). When I asked the amount she stated a figure more than what it was supposed to be because they left off the free night. To their credit, however, once I \"reminded\" them of the free night deal they quickly deducted it and charged the accurate amount. I would recommend if booking through any of the deals that you figure in advance exactly what should be owed. We were provided a side \"ocean view\" room on the second floor that had a living room with a pullout sofa, kitchenette, bath room and separate bedroom with king size bed.

We walked across this and he found a door, entered a code and got to the floor where our room was located. When I asked him how we would get to our room if we left he said he wasn't sure because we didn't have the key code!!

When we asked the front desk what time the loud music and dancing would end (we had a small child who wanted to sleep), the woman at the desk was completely unaware of anything happening. She checked with someone else and after a 15 min delay she said she thought it would be over around 11pm. We asked to be moved to a different room away from the noise but was told the hotel was booked despite the \"VACANCY\" sign out front.

We came across the Princess Royale after driving down Coastal Highway and stopping in a variety of hotels and picking up information at each. We found that the Princess Royale had a lot of perks that fit our family. The main thing being 2-room suites (with kitchenettes) that suited us well when our children were younger and went to bed earlier than we did. We have also utilized the self-serve laundry services in the past located on two floors of the hotel. That started a yearly tradition that has been going on for about 6 years. This year (2011) when we checked in, we were promptly met by a bell hop by the front door. Valet parking was an option ($5 a night) or park yourself, if you like. We have always been able to find off street parking in the small parking garage in front of the hotel (no extra charge). We were taken to the 2-bedroom condo that we would be in for the week. The condo was beautiful with an incredible view! It had a full-size kitchen and washer and dryer. It was also nice for our teen and almost teen daughters to have their own room to share and their own bathroom as well. Another bonus is a small safe in the master bedroom. Two shelves, large enough for a laptop computer and you set the 4 diget code each time you close it. The rooms have always been clean. We brought a laptop this year to take advantage of the wireless internet available in the room. I'm not sure if it was high speed, but it was very handy for planning the next day's activities. We had an issue with the TV this year. The last tenant set the parent lock on the TV in the living room. We had someone from Engineering in the room within 10 minutes, at 9 PM no less, who had the problem fixed in less time than it took him to get to the room. Our room had a VCR and a DVD player with the TV in the livingroom. Though I didn't take advantage of it this year, the hotel has a workout room on the first floor. I have used the tread mill, weights and stationary bike before. Being on 91st Street, the hotel is across the street from the Super Fresh grocery store, which we utilized to save some money cooking our own meals in our full size kitchen. Having the ability to prepare and eat meals in is a real money saver, plus we had somewhere to put the leftovers from meals out (for the next day's lunch). It is also across the street from Sunsations, which came in handy when we needed to replace broken goggles right as we were heading to the beach. They also have a small convenience store and a gift shop on the first floor. Both came in handy when in need of an item, but I didn't want to leave the hotel. Since the hotel is oceanfront, the beach is accessible right from the hotel, so no need to travel and find a parking space. Also across the street is Candy Kitchen and Layton's Restaurant is next door. We took several trips down to the Boardwalk, but were very happy to come back \"home\" to the hotel where it's quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the Boardwalk and surrounding area. When we had our fill of sand, we headed into the beautiful Atrium to use the indoor pool and indoor and outdoor jacuzzis. This has been invaluable to us when the kids want something to do, and it's either too late in the day to swim on the beach or the weather doesn't cooperate. The pool and jacuzzis were well tended and cleaned by the staff daily. We saw the outdoor jacuzzi was emptied at night and refilled every day during our stay. They also provide complementary towels for use at the pool. The Princess Royale has one of the best kept secrets in Ocean City - Schooner's Restaurant. The food is unsurpassed! We make it a point to eat there at least once during our stay. The wait staff there is also great. We never had to look for our waitress or ask for a refill. We have never been disappointed. Unfortunately, we've never been in OC during July or August when they have their Seafood buffet, but if it's half as good as the food off the menu, it's definitely worth the trip. Whenever we have had to call the desk for assistance, the staff has been courteous and prompt in responding.

When we first arrived at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised, but as our stay progressed, I became more and more disappointed. On our first night, someone from guest services called the room to make sure everything was okay and to see if we needed anything. I asked for a portable crib for our 1-year old. The woman didn't know anything about cribs, so she put me on hold for a few minutes, only to tell me that they charge $15/night for cribs. I don't know how that compares to other hotels in Ocean City, but out of all the hotels we've stayed in since my 4-year old was born, we've NEVER been charged for a crib. The next day, we found out that neither of the two televisions worked very well (they both had poor reception on some channels), and the remote for one wasn't working. Also, the jacuzzi bathtub - one of the things I was looking forward to the most - didn't work. The furniture in the living room was a bit dingy and the mattress in the bedroom was way too soft for me so I had backaches every morning. Finally, when we called down to ask about a business center where we could print something, the operator told us where to go and said she would have security open the door for us. However, when we arrived, it turned out we needed a credit card to use the computer (which we hadn't brought with us). This wouldn't have been a big deal except (1) it was annoying that we were being charged, and (2) it takes forever to get from the lobby to some of the rooms. The floorplan is strange, and to get to our room on the 8th floor, we had to take one elevator to the second floor, then walk down three long hallways, then take another elevator to the 8th floor. It took a while. So it would have been helpful if she had TOLD us about the credit card on the phone!

I will be going to Ocean City once per year & will always stay here!", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hyattsville, MD", "Title": "\u201cOur new home away from home...\u201d", "Author": "EarthyBarbara", "ReviewID": "UR104302252", "Content": "Over the past few decades my husband and I generally stayed at the same Ocean City, MD, hotel. It was time for a change. So, I searched the Internet for a change of venue. I came across The Princess Royale Resort. My main criteria was an oceanfront hotel with a large indoor pool and Jacuzzi. The Princess Royale seemed the perfect choice. I scanned TripAdvisor.com and found many positive reviews. So, I went on-line and booked a 2-night stay. I decided afterwards to add an extra day so called the hotel. Then, a short while later I checked the most recent TripAdvisor.com reviews. Much to my dismay, there were several very negative and troubling reviews. I therefore called the hotel and canceled our reservation. I was then charged a $25.00 cancellation fee on my credit card. I did not recall seeing anything on the website about a cancellation fee although I'm sure there is a blurb somewhere. When I had called the hotel to add an extra day after I booked on-line, the reservationist did not mention anything about a cancellation fee. So, I called the hotel complaining about the $25.00 fee and was basically told \"tough luck\" that is our policy. I was aware that on the second page of the hotel confirmation in fine print the cancellation fee. However, this is after the fact and after the reservation had been made. I decided to send an e-mail to the hotel complaining about the cancellation fee. A few hours later, I received an e-mail from one of the hotel mangers waiving the cancellation fee on a one-time courtesy basis. The gest of this is be aware of the $25.00 cancellation fee when booking a room at The Princess Royale. In my e-mail communications with the hotel I also stated that the reason I canceled our reservation was due to several negative TripAdivsor.com reviews. The PR manager, Diane, took the time to explain the nature of the negative reviews and that misunderstandings and misinformation had been posted on TripAdvisor.com. I very much appreciated the time that Diane took to explain the negative reviews which ultimately resulted positively in my mind-set about the hotel. She also offered us a 25% discount on our room. Feeling comfortable, I decided to go ahead and book my husband and I at The Princess Royale for 3 nights. When we checked in at the hotel, low and behold we were booked in the VIP condominium for the price of a regular suite! The condo was absolutely spectacular. Two bedrooms (one King bed, the other two Queen beds), two full baths (one with Jacuzzi tub), one bedroom even had a sink and vanity. There was a large living room overlooking the ocean with a balcony with views of both the ocean and bay-side. The large kitchen had a huge granite counter with three bar stools which served as a dining area. There was even a formal dining room. Also, a washer and dryer inside a linen closet. The condo was spacious and magnificent with plenty of closets with shelves to put all our clothing and other travel items. The carpeting was new, clean and comfortable. The only damage I noticed in the condo was a small area of peeling paint in one of the bathrooms. The furniture left a little to be desired. One living room chair was damaged and felt like you were sitting on the floor. One bedroom ceiling fan was inoperable. Other than that, all was great! There were issues with the water, (especially hot water) and one day the water was turned off for several hours. This is not unusual for O.C. hotels. The Tempur-pedic beds were very comfortable, a little firm but quality sleeping. The pillows were a little lumpy and odorous. I don't understand why hotels don't use pillow liners under the pillow cases to keep perspiration from penetrating the pillows. Oh, well. There was a very nice almost terry-like thin blanket on the beds which was comfortable, warm and fuzzy. Be advised that the towels are equipped with tracking devices that will set off an alarm if you try to walk out of the hotel. There is a sign in the bathroom advising guests. For the life of me, I don't know why anyone would want to steal hotel towels when you can buy better quality towels just about anywhere. One minor thing, there is complimentary shampoo but no conditioner, so you may wish to bring your own. We had no issues with the Wi-Fi in the hotel whatsoever. The Housekeepers did a great job servicing our room on a daily basis. The hotel itself is very clean and custodians were cleaning all aspects of the hotel and lobby regularly. One thing that is noteworthy is that the entire property is non-smoking. I am not a smoker, but I did notice many cigarette butts just outside the hotel lobby. Perhaps the hotel should install smoking outposts outside the property to prevent this eyesore. Custodians had to sweep the cigarette butts constantly. Now, about the swimming pool. Many hotels post website photos of their pool area taken with a wide-angle lens to make the pool appear larger. This is certainly not needed with The Princess Royale Hotel indoor atrium Olympic-side pool. There is also a fair-size Jacuzzi next to the pool, but unfortunately, several of the water jets were inoperable. The pool and Jacuzzi water is clean and chlorination and Ph levels are checked regularly. The water temperature in the pool and Jacuzzi was very comfortable. The pool itself was very clean (no scum on tiles). There are also two saunas located near the pool. In the summer, there is a snack and beverage bar and plenty of video games and claw machines for the kids. One suggestion I would like to make to The Princess Royale hotel management is to install a lock at the pool entrance area wherein you must have a hotel key to access the pool. This would prevent non-guests and non-desirables from just walking inside the pool area and taking advantage of the entire pool facilities. When you enter the hotel lobby you will be impressed with the fountain, plush furniture and decorum. One thing I noticed in the hotel hallways is that the carpeting has no tears or split seams. Generally, hotel carpeting leaves something to be desired. However, the hallway carpeting was clean and in great shape. One problem that deters from the aesthetics of the hotel are dents in many of the hotel room doors. We attributed this to guests letting the doors slam on the Bell Carts as they dragged them inside their hotel rooms. That's a shame that some people are so careless. We dined twice at the hotel restaurant \"Schooners.\" It's a medium-size quaint restaurant and several tables are oceanfront. The food is average but the soup is great (potato cheese and French onion). We also had the breakfast buffet which was also average and limited. The ambience of the restaurant is great and I'm sure there are some dishes that are delicious. During the summer, there is a seafood buffet in one of the conference rooms. The hotel also has a gift shop and convenience store which is a little pricey. Anything else you want to know about The Princess Royale you can find out on the hotel website. Overall with our very positive experience, we have decided to make The Princess Royale Resort our \"Home Away from Home\" when visiting Ocean City, Maryland.

Anyway, this hotel is what I would expect at a summer beach community, not the greatest place, not the worst place, just average. It was clean but in need of some upgrading. The front desk staff checked us in quickly and they, as well as all the staff I encountered, were very pleasant . We stayed as part of a group attending a cheerleading competition held at the convention center and this place was sufficient for our needs, rooms a great size. The indoor pool area was ok and appealed to the younger kids, but I would not have wanted a room that overlooked it, it was a loud area. Two complaints I had: there was an odd odor in our bathroom which I decided may have been the cleaning products, I did report it to the front desk to have housekeeping check, (but not sure if they addressed it since odor remained) and their fitness room was not so great, very musty odor in there, I could not stay in there and was unable to use it because of that, but I was not impressed by it anyway. All in all this place was nothing to write home about, but like I said, was sufficient for our needs.

I must say that if you are there for the indoor pool and hot tub and you are not fond of kids and loud noises, be sure to check if there are any groups before you book. While we didn't mind, someone else might not have been pleased with the pool being overrun with the kids there for a soccer tournament. The atrium area got really loud and since the pool closed at 10 p.m., I also wouldn't recommend a room overlooking the pool! Our room was completely silent, however, and was totally relaxing.

Our organization has stayed at numerous hotels in past years and none can compare to the Princess Royale, I arrived a day early just in casr there were any issues during check in for the parents and was pleased that there were none. I introduced myself to the people in group sales and they were extremely friendly and accomodating. I never experienced any issues with noise, which can happen when you have 500 cheerleaders in a hotel. I had a pool level room and when the sliding glass door was closed the room was very quiet even when the pool was packed with the cheerleaders. The pool is huge and was a great amenity for the kids as well as the parents. The beds are extremely comfortable as they are tempurpedic and you just sink into luxury when you are sleeping. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious with all the comforts of home. Great for when you are traveling with family as you have a seperate living room and bedroom. The rooms were very clean with plenty of towels and pillows. The sauna and hot tubs were wonderful as well. The parents in our organization just raved about the hotel with no complaints at all. Our organization has already booked again for next years competition. My husband and I also have stayed at this hotel many times during the winter and we love it. We have stayed in poolveiw as well as ocean front rooms and both are very very nice in ther own way. If you want and ocean front room try to get a corner room because the balcony wraps around and you get the extra bonus of having a veiw of the bay as well. My husband is a very light sleeper but has always had the best nights sleep in the comfy beds at this hotel. Noise has never been a problem. My husband loves the pool as he like to swim laps and the pool is extremely large and is great for laps. We have eaten in the restaurant a couple of times for brunch and it has always been good. It is great having 2 tv's as he can watch his sports and I can watch what I like as well. We typically do not go to Ocean City during the summer because we don't like the crowds but I have a friend who stays there at least 2 times a summer for family vacations and they would stay no where else.

Room: We were wary after reading some of the reviews, but had a decent experience . For the money, the suite was large and had plenty of room. The beds were GREAT, and the furniture appeared fairly new. The kitchen area and bathroom definetly needed updating, as did the carpet (looked pretty dirty). There was a faint scent of seafood, that had apparently been microwaved by the last tenant (not a good scent, btw). The location was good for us, as we didn't care much to go to the boardwalk, but only wanted some beach time (loved that). The indoor pool was a very nice option, as one of the days was chilly and rainy. Most of the staff was fine, but certainly not friendly or welcoming in any way. We did have one small issue, where my child left an item in the room when we checked out. I called about 5 hours after checkout and was shuffled around from person to person before finally reaching an answering machine. I was shocked and completely taken aback by this. I tried to reach the manager or supervisor on duty and was literally told that I couldn't speak to anyone else about my issue and to leave a message with the lost and found. I felt that the operator and front desk clerk were giving me the run around and trying to keep me from talking to anyone \"in charge\". In my opinion, this is TERRIBLE customer service. Long story short, I reached a much more helpful employee the next day (I think her name was Brandy) who took it upon herself to check with security while I was on the phone, and offered to check again the next time she worked. The item was never found, which was of concern as well. The bottom line is that Princess Royale is a fine place to stay, as long as you know what you're getting into. The customer service is less than stellar, but if the stay is problem-free, that isn't really an issue.

This was my Anniversary weekend trip. We drove all friday evening and arrived around 1 am. Upon arrivial the entry way was very nice and somewhat elegant. Check in was hassle free and quick. We made our way to the room #470..entered our room , found it to be on the older side but appeared comfortable. with all the news reports of bed bugs we decided to check our room well. My wife pulled the sheet and comforter back and immidiatly found this bug crawling across the sheet. we nnotified the front desk and the promptly sent some one with a new key card to another room. so on to #570. we talked along the way could it be that all the hotel rooms could be infested? we get to room #570, walk in and began our inspection. we didn't see any bugs but we did find dirty pillow cases. We are simple people, we just wanted a relaxing stress free 3 days. By the look on my wife face that wasn't going to be possible here. We made our way back to the front desk where i informed the night clerk that i was sorry but i couldn't stay in his hotel. he asked what was wrong with that room? i explained the sheets were dirty, he said he'd have them change right away. i told him no that wasn't going to work. that between the bugs and the dirt there was no way we could rest in his hotel. He say's fine but i'm not giving you a refund. I questioned his position and asked him if he would sleep in either bed? he refused to answer, but responded again that he wasn't refunding my money for that night. I again asked him is that the right way to handle this? How about I start knocking on doors and telling everyone about his bed bug problem. He responded go ahead l'll call security. i demanded all info he could give me on ownership and management and told him this would not end well for his hotel. He gave me the numbers I had requested. as we are making our way to our car we we're forced to search through a 3rd floor parking deck with no working lighting. 2am and we're still looking for a room. we stopped at the Clarion. The clerk was very helpful but couldn't provide us with a room. she did however point us in the direction of the Hilton. We arrived and found a very clean upscale hotel that in the end was only $20.00 more a night. We had the most enjoyable stay. The service was amongst the best we had ever recieved at any hotel or resort. I still have not recieved a refund from Princess Royal, but I will not stop telling about our experience.

We were very happy when we checked in that the room was very clean - immaculate, and each day it was cleaned very well by the housekeeping staff. We had five people (family with 3 young children), so having the room cleaned each day while we were out was very nice (we had considered renting a house or condo for the week, so in comparison, the hotel room with housekeeping was much better for us.) Our room was a suite with two separate rooms (with a door separating the two), and a nice efficiency kitchen and a full refrigerator/freezer. We ate most breakfasts and lunches in our room, which meant not waiting for service in restaurants, and this worked out well. We found the kitchen to be quite adequate for this purpose. It would be challenging to prepare a full dinner on the two-burner stove, but we did make spaghetti for dinner one night, and it was fine - it was actually cozy and one of the things we'll remember as a fun family time together. In general it was very easy to get to the beach (and back to the hotel for the inevitable bathroom trips). We found that there were many other families staying at the hotel, and we found everyone (hotel staff included) to be very friendly. We ate at the buffet one night and were not terribly impressed that a) the ice cream machine didn't work because it hadn't been turned on b) only one person in the restaurant could turn it on c) the food was pretty good, but not great.

Our room was very nice and the bed was very very comfortable. So comfortable that, although I am normally up and at 'em by 5:30, I missed the sunrise three of the four mornings we were there (and I love watching sunrises). Everything in the room was clean and neat and we were well-supplied with toilet paper and soaps and shampoos. (We decided to not use housekeeping services and I was able to get anything we needed from one of the housekeepers in the hallway.) The room includes a kitchen area with a stove, dishwasher, microwave and refrigerator. We didn't need these items, but for a family that wants to save on food while vacationing, this is a great asset. The beach in front of the Princess Royale is very nice. Umbrellas could be rented with the plus that they also planted the umbrellas for you. (We joked about slipping the guy a few bucks to put ours in the sand for us because we couldn't get ours in as deep as the young fellow did.) Our room was oceanview this time instead of oceanfront. To be honest, if money isn't a factor, I'd choose oceanfront. We didn't hear nearly as much street noise when we were oceanfront as we did this time in the oceanview room. The oceanfront room just seemed more private than the oceanview room. But if you are on a budget, the oceanview room does give a good view of the ocean, not just a little peek like you get at some hotels. There are a lot of amenities here that we did not take advantage of -- gift shop, sundries shop, pool, hot tubs, work out room, jewelry shop, and salon come to mind. We did eat several times at Schooners, the in-house restaurant and there is review of that in the dining section of tripadvisor. Schooners is a very nice place for a meal or a snack or a drink and seating is available outside if you want. The only category that I did not give a full 5 rating to was service and this was because of the attitude of some of the folk at the front desk.

Parking was not a problem at all. They had an area designated just for over-sized vehicles (car-top carriers, trucks, etc.) which we used. The indoor pool area was nice as well, and the pool was kept at a nice temperature. The hotel's location right on the beach is GREAT, and even with a Side Oceanview room we had an excellent view of the beach and ocean. The front desk staff was pleasant on both check-in and check-out. We had an issue with our bill being incorrect, which was addressed the day after we checked out. I have read on previous reviews that management staff is unwilling to help with issues, and speaking for myself, I did not find that to be the case, as they addressed my problem in a timely manner.

We held our family reunion the end of July 2010. The resort in nasty and lacks customer services throughout the place. We had no idea it was going to be so many problems. 1) Family had problems booking their rooms due to poor service. Although we had an identified contatc person to assist us (Lisa Roberts), she did nothing to accomodate us for the price we all paid. The rooms that were to be held for the family were not. Amazingly, all the ocean front rooms were booked but not by my family eventhough we reserved them for the family with Lisa in Febuary. 2) The condo's were also booked. Again they were to be held for the family. I was told that I could not reserve the condo for the dates that I wanted. But before signing off on the reunion contract with this place they had the dates avaible. I just wanted to stay Thrusday-Sunday the time of the reunion but I was told that I could only stay Friday-Monday. Why?? When the cost for the affair was over $3,000 not including all the booked rooms. I was told that I had to rent a smaller unit for Thursday and would be still charged for Sunday. One family member wanted to rent a three bedroom condo for a week. She was told that she had to rent the room from Saturday-Saturday and check into a two bedroom condo on Saturday-Sunday because the only rent the condo's from Sat-Sat. Why??? To rent the condo for a week was roughly $3,000 and you cant make adjustments so they would not have to pack up and relocate to another room. No accomodating or customer services from Ms. Roberts or any other staff. 4) At the front desk for check in they had the most rude people working there.. When my group checked in at went to the rooms they were dirty, smelly and old. An Ocean View room could be really the view of a parking lot and a few buildings. When I called down to the front desk to tell them of the problems the person on the other end strated yelling at me that \"It was nothing we can do\". I then aked to speak with the manager she said she was and hung up the phone. Down at the front desk people were already there complaing of the smell and service. A woman was at the desk stating she had \"mice\" in her room. The front desk staff was telling people that it was \"nothing that they could do because they were already charged for the room and they were booked so no room alternatives were available and the charge was non-refundable.\" I asked for the person who was managing. When she came out with an negative attitude and wlaked over to the couple standing off to the side of me. When she was told that I had asked for her she stated rudely that she did not have \"time for this and would call for sercurity\". She was unhelpful in trying to understad the problems of the guest and was hostile. We had to rent a house at the last minute instead of staying at the place. But some family members had no choice but to stay. The Banquet had to go-on because thousands were non-refundable at this point. 5) At the Banquet, the food was under-cooked properly and nasty. All of it was sent back four times and still not served properly. The air condition was broke and in the middle of the affair they brought in a ladder and began to try and fix it. They were unable to but made a mess along the way. And still charged us full price and some extra for all of this mess. The PITS!! The WOrst place every. .

We stayed in a king jacuzzi room and while the room wasn't filthy, it was worn and time for a complete renovation. Particularly the rug was dirty and there were threads pulled up, the microwave made an awful smell when we tried to heat up some pizza, the jacuzzi tub was worn and dirty which we didn't even use, and there were other minor issues with the room. However, it was fairly clean and the bed was awesome (memory foam type). The pillows however, were old and very thin. One more issue, we had with the room was the fact we needed to jam a towel in the AC vent so it didn't blow cold air across our necks (the first night we got stiff necks). The biggest disappointment of the place was the pool and hot tubs. We expect the water in the pool to be clear but the water in the pool was so cloudy and dirty we didn't even get in. The indoor hot tub looked dirty and brown. The outdoor hot tubs didn't look much better and the water level was very low in those. The poolside bar and restaurant's food was just average.

Normally when they go to the pool they are there for hours. The \"hot tub\" was not hot. It was had an oil slick and hair balls floating around in it.

I agree with the other reviews that the hall carpet is a bit tired looking, but it has to be hard to keep the hallway carpet looking good in a large beach front hotel. A few previous review mentioned the water outage...we were there that night. There was a large sign on the front desk alerting guests to this outage from midnight until 6a.m. I thought this was an excellent time to shut off the water. Any other time would have been a much bigger inconvenience. We were also there during the fire alarm, which was handled well and only lasted for a very short time.

I stayed (with wife and 2 small children), with another family (husband, wife, 1 small child) for 4 nights in August. The Pros: 1. Location - this can also be a con if you want to near the boardwalk, but you should know better before booking. The boardwalk is a good 15 min. drive south (impossible to walk to). However, if you are looking for a hotel that is RIGHT ON THE BEACH, this hotel cannot be beat. You walk out of your room, and there's the beach. They have hoses to clean yourself off before you return to your hotel room. 2. Cleanliness - yes, some of the carpets in the hotel look run down. WHO CARES. Do you sleep in the hallway? It is a BEACH HOTEL. People track in sand all day, what do you expect? And when I say rundown, I don't mean holes or stains or odors. It just looks old. GET OVER IT. The rooms however look great. I stayed in a condo, the other family in an oceanfront 1 bedroom suite. Both rooms looked to be renovated and clean - no bugs, no odors, everything worked, etc. Furniture was NOT rundown. The TV has a BUNCH of cable channels - no HBO - again, WHO CARES? Do you go on vacation to watch HBO??? And each day, housekeeping cleaned up the room nicely. The one day that we stayed in the room because of rain, they came 4 times asking if we wanted the room made. I actually felt bad because each time I kept saying \"another 2 hours\". And they kept coming back to check - great attention to detail. And I never saw stained towels either. 3. Service - it seems to me that OC in general, not just this hotel, has some type of large student exchange program with Eastern European countries. Everywhere (stores, restaurants, hotels) there are young kids working with accents that are of Eastern European descent. So yes, at times it can be a little challenging to maybe try to communicate with them, but for the most part, they are all friendly and have a good command of the English language. But again, it's not just this hotel - this is commonplace throughout OC. 4. Balconies offer a great view. And yes, the chairs on your balcony are plastic, white chairs. Again, who cares??? 5. Pool - yes, it is unheated and indoors, but that was great when it rained and provided some cool (not COLD) relief after baking on the beach for a few hours. It is very clean and wasn't crowded at all throughout the day. The Cons: 1. The limited access to the Wifi is annoying, however, after repeated attempts, I was able to logon multiple times per day. If they can fix this issue, this would eliminate my number one complaint. 2. Schooner's food is pretty good, but not the best. If you want the best seafood in OC, go off property. But if you want a convenient, adequate seafood buffet, there is nothing wrong with Schooner's. I do think the alcoholic drink prices were a little pricey though. 3. Workout facility - it is very small (about 15 machines only) and the weight machines are dated. This needs updating. Other notes include - the entire place is non smoking, and it is VERY quiet after 10pm. There is no outside noise whatsoever. And there is a grocery store right across the street. A/C worked fine in both rooms. The cons were minor. This is a FANTASTIC hotel, if you don't mind being so far from the boardwalk.

A 77 YRO disabled vet with a disabled wife, I reserved a $338-a-night ocean view room for my wedding anniversary. This large facility is badly in need of major renovations. From a cosmetic view, it's great but in reality, for the price, there are many unsatisfactory guest amenities uner the surface such as: (1) The $3000.00 Tempur-Pedic mattress sleeps great but on the balcony, we found two cheap white plastic molded stack-type chairs, one which my wife found had a broken leg. Had she sat in it, she would have fallen and injured herself seriousy. After a second call to guest services, the chair was replaced with a similar one from another room. The next morning, maintenance again replaced the chair that he brought in the previous evening with a similar chair that had a fractured leg in the same area as above which had also been repaired (glued). (2) Upon check-in, we found the in-room safe locked. Although maintenance responded within 15 minutes to open it, I would expect for such a pricey room that should be part of the housekeeping procedure to check when preparing the room for new guests. (3) When my wife attempted to use the kitchen sink disposal, she found a plastic bottle cap and several other items in it. She didn't use the sink thereafter. Again, not good pre-occupancy checks. (4) Unable to connect to the hotel's Wi-Fi system, consistently getting \"out-of-range\" or \"inaccessible\" messages. (5) Inaccessible and unclear TV station guides in each room and difficult to get local news although CNN, HLN, MSNBC and BUSINESS news stations were included in the \"Delmarva\" TV station guide; no HBO pay-per-view movies are available. (6) The hallway carpets are severely worn and faded. Looks like the originals when the building was first constructed. (7) The ODOR in the fitness room is very BAD and seems to permeate from the carpet. (8) The restaurant offers very little menu selections. Guests are better off seeking outside eating facilities. (9) During my stay and on the morning of check-out, the elevator in the multi-tiered garage was not working, causing guests to hae to walk up stairs which are located at each end of the garage.

We've been going to Myrtle Beach for the past 7 summers, staying in a two bedroom condo, so I was a little apprehensive about the amount of space the Princess Royale suite would provide for the five nights we were there. I was also growing a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews on here. Both concerns were unnecessary. When we opened the door, the first thing I checked for was cleanliness. It was very, very clean; and we liked the layout very much. Plenty of room for the four of us. It had a closing door between the bedroom and living area which provided privacy. We only ate lunch in the suite. It had a full-size refrigerator so we had plenty of room for food and drinks. We got the breakfast buffet with our summer saver reservations, and it was very good, albeit it could have been a little hotter. I saw steam rising from the catering trays, so I'm not quite sure why the food didn't stay hotter. The bathroom was very clean and a good size (we're used to having two full baths in Myrtle Beach). Housekeeping was good. No hallway or outside noise. The only annoying noise was from the air conditioner located right next to one of the beds in the bedroom. It vibrated and was a little too noisy. The hotel itself was very clean, despite the pigs who come to stay as guests. In all fairness to the hotel, it must be a herculean task to keep that place clean. The sand people bring into the hallways near the rooms! You think they would try and rinse before they come in. There is a hose right outside (actually two) near the entrance to the pool. And then, one day, as we were going to the elevator on the 4th floor, we saw that someone had left a dirty diaper on the bench next to the elevator. COME ON PEOPLE! Have a little courtesy and respect! We did have an issue one day with one of the \"clean\" towels that was left in the bathroom. It was streaked with some kind of brown streaks. My husband brought it down the the front desk and they quickly had another one delivered. Ironically, the next day, we had a similarly streaked towel with our \"clean\" batch. I can't imagine that the dirty one from the day before had somehow found its way back to our room! Out of all those rooms, what would the chance of that be? I said to my husband that since they were a symmetrical type of streak, it almost looked like it had gotten caught in the dryer or something, and maybe that was what was happening and accounted for us getting two of the same-looking towel. I'm going to keep telling myself that anyway. All in all, it was a very nice stay. I can't comment on the indoor pool because I didn't use it.

First of all the hotel itself was horrible! It was totally outdated. It had a musty weird smell throughout the whole place. The elevators took forever and always sounded like they were going to break down. The whole place was dirty. The parking garage had an awful setup and when we went on that elevator and it wouldn\u2019t work! The door finally opened so my family and the other family decided to get off and take the stairs (we used the stairs the rest of our stay). Second, the rooms were awful! We had reserved a cabana room, but then realized you had to walk down creepy hallways and take 2 elevators to get to the room! When we got to that room we couldn\u2019t get the lights to work until we realized that you have to put your room key in a power slot at the door. Who ever heard of such a stupid thing!? We also realized that people were standing right outside our patio fence which was creepy. My husband would not have let me or my daughter stay there so called the front desk and luckily got another room. The second room we got was on the third floor, with no view except the building beside us, and this room was even worse than the last one! It smelled horrible, it was dirty, and the a/c barely worked. Our room was hot the whole weekend! Third, don\u2019t eat at Schooner\u2019s! We went there for breakfast before going to the beach. We ordered off the menu and did not get the buffet! There were only 3 of us and our food took forever! However when we finally got our food it was cold and literally tasted like cardboard! Fourth, be careful when you take a shower! I took a shower while my husband and daughter were at the pool. The smoke alarm went off in my room 3 times! The first 2 times I fell trying to get out of the shower and made sure there was no fire. However the third time it happened I called guest services where I got a woman who in a smirk voice said \u201cNo there\u2019s no fire in this building\u201d. I explained to her what happened and that I fell, but she just wanted to send up maintenance but I said no I\u2019m trying to shower! She then transferred me to the front desk where I got the manager Mortisha. She was very rude and informed me that there was no fire, but she wanted to send up security (I wasn\u2019t sure why she wanted to send security). I said no I\u2019m trying to shower, and she said \u201cTake a cooler shower\u201d so the alarm wouldn\u2019t go off. I hung up to finish my shower and she called back and wanted to know why I hung up, I said so I can go finish my shower! She then told me I need to make sure to stop at security before leaving that day. On top of it the next day when I was showering, my daughter saw a bill slide under our door and watched the guy walk away. While the fire alarm was going off in our room! Fifth, the pool is green and cloudy! It was so disgusting! Sixth, the employees were the most inconsiderate, rude people we\u2019ve ever had to deal with. For example, I went down to check out and I had a man helping me he asked how my stay was and I said awful! He didn\u2019t say anything, but kept looking up my information. I then asked if the charge for the safe box was already charged, and another female employee jumps in and very nasty says \u201cIt was charged when you checked in and we have signs on both ends of the front desk walls about the charge.\u201d The thing is I was fine with the charge I just wanted to pay cash for it instead of them charging my credit card, but I couldn\u2019t even get that out. After all of that I asked for the hotels insurance company because I fell 2 times. That\u2019s when Mortisha jumped in and started yelling at me that I should\u2019ve stopped at security, it was only then she told me I was to put in a complaint with them about falling she did not say that before. She also said that if there was a real fire there million dollar security system would have went off (wouldn\u2019t you think if there was really a fire in the room and our smoke detector went off that the whole hotels alarm would go off?) She kept going on yelling, and called security to get us away from her front desk. We hadn\u2019t even done anything! While we waited for security Mortisha and the other white female kept yelling, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very appropriate when a hotel manager says to you she has thick skin on her take me out. I had not even said a word to her! Security gets there and I explained to him about my whole stay and what just happened. He could have cared less, and then another security man came and said the only thing I could do was to call Mike Meyer head of security, and with that we left. Not one person has yet to ask if I was ok from falling. ALL of the employees that work there could care less about anything! Those were just a FEW COMPLAINTS I had about this hotel!

Because it has all been said before, I won't go into detail about it all, but rather just give a short perspective on my experience, for scientific purposes...Oh, and to give another view point. Knowing what we know, we looked 'round' for a last minute deal at OC. We booked this spot last minute (on Thursday for a Sat. thru Mon. stay) on a local site (as opposed to one of the big 3, or 4, and so on), and found a great rate at this hotel. After checking the reviews on TA, we popped. The front desk was friendly and helpful and check in was a breeze. We were assigned a 1st floor oceanfront \"CABANA\". Yes, they do call it a CABANA, but it's a 1st floor walk-out with a patio instead of a balcony. It was a chore to get to but once we found the secret (walk 'round the beach side to the front) it worked well. Our CABANA (#113) was very cave like at night, but in the morning and thru out the day it was flooded nicely by natural light. Our CABANA did have a nice view of the ocean from the ground floor, but was partially blocked by the beach bar. Why they would put the bar in front of a room/rooms (111 & 113), I don't know, but they did. I did read on TA of the noise complaints from the music act and did get to see/hear it up close and personal-like... He was 25 feet from our CABANA, just beside the bar. Oddly enough, being that close to our CABANA wasn't a bother...the bother was it was too loud when we were drinking at said bar enjoying said act! The dude is good and was very entertaining and we dug him, but honestly Diane, it is a bit loud. Now for the short of it. Didn't eat the food there. Didn't swim in the pool. Would never, ever, ever (did I say never or ever?) book a room on the pool level or in the atrium due to the arcades/pool tables and so on...But we did like this spot for its beachfront locale, customer service (no doubt due to the TA users feedback), and for the last minute price we found. If we would have paid full price, our review would be different. All in all we had fun, yes the CABANA was a 'lil worn (as was other rooms we peeked), yes in comparison to other parts of the beachfront world its a 'lil shady, but thats OC, and its why (for OC standards) it gets 3 stars from us.

All I can say is that we had probably the best beach vacation ever. Instead of booking one of the regular rooms (which are very nice -- depending upon what view you pay for) we opted for a Condo this visit. Condos are located on floors 6 to 10 at the Princess Royale and are all Ocean Front. All I can say is WOW! We were lucky and were assigned a 3 bedroom 3 bath end unit that had at least 25 feet of Ocean Front facing balcony -- with views of the Ocean and a wrap around tail to the balcony that enabled you to see the bay too. Breathtaking! The condo has three sliders to the deck. One from the Master; family room and front guest room (with two beds); The third bedroom had a king size bed -- as did the Master bedroom which also had a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom and then a full size master bath with huge walk-in shower. These condos were done very nicely and include dining rooms and fully equiped kitchens that even have granite counter-tops. Honestly.. you cannot find a nicer, cleaner, friendlier, convenient and reasonably priced Resort like this anywhere else in Ocean City, MD. Walk down the hall, down the elevator and and you're right at the beach! While we opted to eat around town for dinner everynight, we did have breakfast every day at the Princess Royale's Schooners Restaurant. We all vote this restaurant a 5 out of 5 stars for consistently good food and friendly service. The pancakes are enormous and our eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly every day. We also enjoyed meeting the many exchange students working at the Resort over the summer. Many of these kids are seeing America for the first time and are amazed at how well we all have it here. So- take a moment to ask some of the servers about their home country and you'll be amazed -- we met kids from Russia, Muldovia, Jordan, Serbia etc. And they are so very hardworking and friendly. Outside, between the Hotel and beach we had the opportunity to visit the snack bar for some of the coldest, frostiest and tastiest Pina Colada's this side of the Bahamas. Topped off with whipped cream and Pineapple -- they were some of the best around! Kids enjoyed the hotdogs and salads that are sold right outside too. Very convenient and reasonably priced. THe Hotel even has service right on the beach !! Where on earth have you seen a server on the beach in Ocean City? The answer is no where. Only here. We didn't use the indoor pool but it appeared to be well kept and popular with many guests. Honestly -- the weather was just so georgeous and the kids wouldn't come out of the waves with their boogie boards all day -- so we never even had time to think about the pool. Some nearby recommendations if you decide to stay here include: Lombardi's Pizza -- right across the street. This place is hands down the number 1 pizza place in Ocean City, MD. Lombardi's has the best pizza you will find in town. It's New York style pizza and it's not a chain. Two brothers run the place and it's obvious they care about what they serve. Equally good is Olive Tree restaurant -- a long time tradition in Ocean City, Md. Of course, right across from Princess Royale is a Candy Kitchen for the kids and a great Cigar store for Dad. Of course, Princess Royale even has room service -- so you have that option too. Well -- that about covers it. Hope this review helps you pick the right resort. If you have a family of four or just want more space, check out the condos. It's nice to have a little more space; privacy for mom & dad and a luxurious spot to unwind after the beach.

Our basic goal was finding a larger hotel room that was clean, beachfront, not too expensive and spacious as we were traveling with two young children. We found all of this in the Princess Royale and were pleased with the experience. I usually read reviews of hotels before booking and found some mixed reviews stating the hotel was dirty, smelly or the service was bad and was slightly concerned, but those worries were allayed after checking in. Sure the carpet was faded in areas, but generally everything was well kept and the service was adequate. The beds were comfortable, clean and even the sofa bed was ok\u2026 Honestly, has anyone really ever found a sofa bed in a hotel even remotely as comfortable as a real bed??? I didn\u2019t think so. Let\u2019s be real- the purpose of a sofa bed is its utility in that it will get you by if you don\u2019t want to spend the money for another room and want to accommodate a couple guests. Would I put my grandparents on it? No, but my two children were more than happy. To put all of this in perspective- oceanfront hotels see a lot more wear and tear than typical hotels: you get partiers, sand from the beach, etc\u2026 So in my experience if you are checking into any mid range hotel on the beach and are expecting a Marriott Renaissance or W hotel you will be disappointed. In addition would I be happy if I had paid 500 per night for my king side ocean view suite I received at the princess? No, but for the price I paid I was more than happy with everything. Pros: Competitively priced Decent location (if you just are looking for the beach, not boardwalk) Clean Adequate and friendly staff Hotel was booked solid for the holiday weekend, but it didn\u2019t seem crowded. Cons: Indoor pool seemed very cold- a lot of people complained. Could have used a few more utensils in the kitchen efficiency- if you plan to cook anything more than grilled cheese and tomato soup bring some measuring cups and or other utensils. We wanted to make pancakes one morning and didn\u2019t have anything to measure ingredients. (We just guessed) One last note- I saw a lot of complaints about the parking. Yes the garage is a bit tight, but I was driving a Full size seven seater conversion van\u2026 even so I had no issue getting in and out of the garage.

The hotel itself is very impressive and spotless. We liked the pool, hot tub and sauna all of which are indoors - that was a good thing because the weather was not that good while we were there. We had an issue with air conditioning which took two visits from different maintenance men - they were at our room within 5-15 minutes of our call to the front desk. While we still had a problem on the second night after the second attempt to fix the problem, we found that by turning the unit off and restarting after a few minutes did the trick. The suite is spacious with the living area seperate from the bedroom which had two queen beds. Great if one person is tired and the other is not. Housekeeping always tidied up our room even though most days we didn't put the \"service\" sign on the door until after 2:00PM. We ate at the hotel restaurant and that was not a good experience for us. It was Thursday night and they had a buffet - prime rib was ok, rest of the food was not hot and seemed to be left over from another night. Chocolate cake for dessert had been sliced ahead of time and displayed with another dessert for your choosing - that made the cake dried out. We order the cheese soup in addition to the buffet and that was superb - we asked our server and another server for soup spoons and they said they didn't have any - curious how such a classy place could not have a soup soon??? All in all, that would not stop us from returning to this fine hotel.

We emphasized that we were a husband, wife, and 15-year-old staying just one night to visit family locally, and we wanted quiet room that would be minimally impacted by any planned receptions/parties (we made this request having read the recent reviews). When we checked in, we were taken with the appearance of the lobby; it\u2019s more lavish than other 3-star hotels we\u2019ve stayed in. We were allowed to check in early, and registration went smoothly. The front desk staff was polite and pleasant. A bellhop helped us to our room. The carpeting in the hallways appeared a bit faded, though not really worn; the walls, doors, etc were in good repair; everything appeared clean. We were shown to a lovely oceanfront room. Upon entering, you walk directly into a sitting room with a sleep sofa, chair, and a tv; all the table tops were granite. The upholstery on the chair and sofa was worn and the cushions offered little support. To the right, there was a kitchen/dining area which consisted of a sink, dishwasher, 2-burner electric stove, and a full-sized refrigerator. The cabinets were stocked with dishes and cookware. To the left was the bathroom with a sink surrounded by a granite counter, tub/shower, and toilet. The suite was very clean except for grime imbedded in the grooves of the vinyl flooring of the kitchen and bathroom area. Clearly, this could not be removed with a simple mopping. At the back of the suite was a bedroom with 2 tempurpedic beds (with an abundance of pillows) and spreads which appeared new, and a wall-mounted flat-screen tv; again all table tops were granite. The highlight: a spectacular view of the beach and ocean. Thankfully, the palm trees lining the beach side of the hotel had been cut; otherwise I think they may have obstructed our 2nd-story view. But, as it was, the view was breathtaking. We dropped our bags and hurried to visit family, returning at 7:30 PM. When we returned, it seemed like a different hotel than the one we\u2019d left 6 hours earlier. Gone was the peaceful quiet, replaced by the raucous partying of football fans who had flocked to the hotel for the Colts/Ravens game that night. Children ran and shrieked through the hallways with no adults in sight. That\u2019s when we discovered that the quiet room we had requested was directly above Schooner\u2019s, the hotel bar/restaurant. The lounge singer (who usually only performs until 8 PM, but was performing until midnight because of the partying) sounded as if he were serenading us in our room. Bright light streaming from the restaurant below washed out our ocean view. Two boys, who looked to be only 8-years-old or so, raced past our door repeatedly, all the while screaming into their hand-held radio. But it wasn\u2019t limited to unattended children: we heard stomping outside our door, only to find that a father was with his two teenage sons who were responsible for all the noise! He offered a sheepish, \u201csorry,\u201d and moved on. With no hope of enjoying either the view or the restful lapping of the waves hitting the shore, I sat down on the sofa and cried. My husband hurried down to the registration desk. Thankfully, without any argument, the front desk moved us to the 4th floor, opposite side of the hotel, while still remaining ocean front. My husband went to check out the room before we moved our bags. The smell of smoke inundated the hallway but there was no odor in our newly assigned room, which was a mirror image of the first though slightly narrower. (The hotel has a 100% no smoking policy, so my husband informed the front desk of the odor. He later learned that security swept the floor and found the culprit, fining him $200. I hope that fee is not just punitive, but is also used to thoroughly freshen the room.) As we traversed the hotel with our bags, I now noticed a lot of food scraps in the hallways, which I\u2019m sure could contribute to the infestations described by kimisusu. However, I was pleased to find there were no screaming football fans or children near this room, and the light from the restaurant at the other side of the hotel actually enhanced our view of the beach. This suite was also very clean except for the imbedded in the grooves of the vinyl flooring. All was well until we got ready for bed and tried to turn on the heat. The metal panel covering the unit rattled loudly and incessantly; my husband tried lining the panel with towels to dampen the noise, but to no avail. And after 10 minutes, when we still did not have heat coming from the vent, we gave up and slept in a cold room (the temperature that night was the 30\u2019s). We chose not to request another change of room. Here\u2019s one of my pet peeves: bathrooms that don\u2019t vent and are filled with steam by the time you finish even a quick shower. I find this to be the case at 90% of the hotels that we stay in, and the Princess Royale was no different. A vent seemed to come on when the light switch was flipped, but it had no effect. As a result, showers had to be taken with the bathroom door left open and a fan propped in the doorway, offering little privacy. Then, there was the water pressure in the shower which is very strongly aerated...our entire family agreed that it felt as if we had been power-washed rather than bathed. I imagine the hotel does this in an effort to conserve water, but we would have been able to shower more quickly had we been able to endure more than 10 seconds at a time beneath the stabbing torrent. In the morning, we enjoyed breakfast at Schooner\u2019s. A buffet is surved from 8AM-11AM on Sundays and it consisted of the typical fare but offered a wider selection (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, French toast, pancakes, corned beef hash, fruit, rolls, and cereal), and the ocean view was outstanding. Unfortunately, there was \u201cstuff\u201d at the bottom of my father\u2019s glass, which he discovered after drinking almost all his OJ. He pointed it out to the waitress who insisted it was only on the outside \u2013 however, he was able to move it with the straw, so clearly it was in his glass! Our waitress did not deduct this from the bill, and was not apologetic; instead, she seemed frustrated by father\u2019s pickiness. At breakfast, we overheard older adult couples complaining about the children and teens who ran though the hallways and apparently banged on doors until the early morning hours. They indicated they were too frightened to call the front desk because they were concerned there would be \u201cpay-backs.\u201d (Very much in keeping with Murphydogg\u2019s review.) We were very glad we asked for a new room, because we enjoyed a peaceful (though cold) evening and had a good night\u2019s rest. I took a quick tour of the hotel to assess its amenities. On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors there are laundry facilities consisting of one coin-operated washer and one coin-operated dryer in a vending area. In the main lobby, there is a gift shop and a convenience store. Near the lobby there is a small fitness center and a business center. At 6:15 AM, I asked the front desk to open the business center for me, they told me that it would open in 45 minutes; when I told them the sign posted by the door stated the hours were 6 AM \u2013 11 PM, they called for security to open it. I was very disappointed in the business center, finding only one computer/monitor, and one printer/copy machine. Furthermore, there was a cost of $0.39 per/minute for the computer, and $0.50 per printed page. This is substantially below par compared to other 3-star hotels that we regularly stay at which offer multiple computers without charge and free printing. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers. Other amenities include an indoor pool (the water did appear yellow as described by murphydogg) and a game area beside the pool. There appeared to be 2 hot tubs, but I could not see them, nor could I access the beach from the back of the hotel, because the doors remained locked even as late as 9 AM. Overall, I felt the accommodations in many ways exceeded those expected of a 3-star resort, and the view from oceanfront rooms is spectacular. Raucous guests left a very poor impression, and it is unfortunate that security was not more visible to quiet unattended children running rampant through the halls.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cshouldn't indoor pools be heated?\u201d", "Author": "murphydogg", "ReviewID": "UR51958867", "Content": "I choose this hotel after an extensive search and time consuming review of prior customers. I was looking for a hotel with an indoor pool to relax away a December day before viewing the Winterfest Lights display. I was so disappointed. The pool water was yellow looking and ice cold, the hot tub water was yellow in color too and had so many children in it that adults couldn't enjoy it. In addition the children were unattended. The only place to get a drink was Schooners because the pool bar had a sign that it was being used for a wedding reception. I only booked two weeks ago or so and I wasn't told that the atrium was being converted to a wedding reception and the ocean view would be blocked, the poolside room we booked would be loud all night long with a festive, inappropriately located wedding reception. I was accomidated to a different room with an ocean view on the 5th floor, but soon found out upon arrival home that evening- a large portion of intoxicated, loud, rude, immature guests were staying on that floor as well. I literally was woken up hourly until 3:45AM by people litterally yelling, running an having 100% disregard for anyone else in the hotel. I was so bothered but scared to call security because I was afraid of repercussions from the rude guests partying in the nearby rooms. I kept hoping hotel security would at least make a routine walk along each floor. I had a nine year old afraid of the commotion- and was woken up along with myself numerous times. All I wanted was to treat my family to a fun day of swimming at a classy hotel.

We were ready to unload our car in no time. Martin handled our belongings carefully and efficiently and we had a very pleasant chat as we walked to our suite. Throughout our four-day stay, he greeted us warmly every time we saw him. Our suite was absolutely wonderful. Everything was very clean and well-maintained, no signs of wear on the furniture at all. We had a living room (w/TV), small kitchenette area (stocked for cooking and dining in), and a lovely bedroom (w/TV). Our bedroom had a king-size bed with the advertised Tempur-pedic mattress (my husband wants one for our home now), five pillows, and excellent sheets and blanket. I was very pleased to find that the bottom sheet was a fitted sheet. (This is important enough to me that I travel with our own fitted sheet in case we need them.) From our room we had two sliding doors. The northerly door opened to a balcony that afforded a great view of the ocean. (Unfortunately, it was way too windy while we were there to enjoy the balcony.) The other door opened to the east to face the ocean. There was no balcony there, but because there was a rail there, you could open the screen fully and stand there at the rail and enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells of the ocean. We looked down on an outdoor dining area with tables, umbrellas and palm trees. Housekeeping took excellent care of our room each day. We never had a complaint about lack of towels and toiletries. The young ladies that we spoke with were very friendly and tried to be as helpful as possible if we had a question for them. We did notify maintenance of one problem while we were there -- the hot water faucet in the tub did not always turn off. We called them about that, went to breakfast, and when we returned about 45 minutes later, the faucet had already been repaired. I never had an opportunity to use the pool, although the pool area is very nice and inviting. Also, there was a conference going on at the hotel while we were there but that did not take away from our stay at all. Additionally, we dined in the on-site restaurant Schooners several times and I have posted a review of that in the restaurant review section. The Princess Royale also has an exercise room, spa, gift shop, sundries shop, and jewelery store. There may be more amenities that I did not see. The thing that impressed me the most about Princess Royale was the professionalism, respect, and friendliness of the employees. I have had so many negative experiences in Ocean City hotels that this was an extremely pleasant surprise. The only other place we have ever been treated so well was at a Disney-operated resort.

Despite bad weather - we could still spend time on the beach, albeit in the wind - watching the Nor'easter with dark skies and huge waves. Having our oceanfront room is the only way to make the best of a rainy/cloudy/windy week - as we'd open our curtains and voila - the Atlantic, with balcony and that's worth everything to us. After Labor the Day this room was affordable. We had read that the hotel had been refurnished for 2009. Yes - the beds are now Tempur-pedic and very very comfortable. We had a flat screen TV on the wall and another in the living area. As for any other remodeling - there's granite everywhere - on the kitchen and bathroom countertops - on the kitchen table, coffee table, end tables, bureaus... The hotel must have gotten a good deal on the granite to add so much - but their money could have been better spent if the hotel would only replace the sleep sofa and loveseat as the upholstered fabric is old and the seats sink a bit and you know how many people have sat on these over the years! The small upholstered chair in the bedroom area could be recovered or replaced. The carpets are old and should be replaced. The partial kitchen we had was great - with a full fridge. Most guests I think will only use this kitchen for breakfast and lunch and so it would have been nice to have a toaster in the kitchen!! - There is only a microwave and 2 burner stove top... so don't expect to cook a meal - but pasta could work! Our bathtub had a lot of mold around the edges and along the wall tiles. There's no excuse for this - as maintenance staff should be on top of it and recalk, as it's a sure turnoff! Our dishwasher leaked - and I was told it was a matter of water pressure and was ok!! - duh - there's water pressure when running a dishwasher - so it really should NOT leak onto the kitchen floor. I am not sure I should mention the many ants we found crawling into the bedroom directly from the sliding doors at the balcony. We were on the 5th floor. We called the front desk and they said they'd sent someone.... A maintenance man (very nice man) came and said the maid service would spray for ants! That in our opinion wasn't going to fix the problem! As for the hotel itself - It has a lot to offer... and since the weather was so cold, winday, rainy, it was nice to relax in front of the 4 story glass window and watch the waves and the palm trees blowing in the wind.... We did not use the pool.... way too many es - video game machines... and also a convenient kiosk that makes drinks and serves pretzels. Another one outside - but seemed closed after Labor Day. We did not partake of the hotel restaurant. The fitness center was small and my husband used it - but said the equipment was somewhat less than ideal... Yes - the hotel did smell a lot from some sort of deoderizer - which didn't bother me but my husband felt that it only means the hotel must have other smells, maybe mold, that it is covering up. The staff was not very friendly at check-in... though maybe they were stressed?? However, whenever we'd ask for something - they were very kind on the phone and took care of our needs... extra towels, ant spray!! maintenance man for dishwasher. Overall - it's a convenient location - and wonderful to have oceanfront room - but the hotel is in much need of an overhaul...The beachfront is very deep and there's a nice deck outside of the indoor pool, with seating, plus 2 hot tubs. Also - the parking lot is tight. It's a covered lot - but the hotel should consider building a covered walkway from parking area to front entrance as in the case of rain - there's no shelter, even though it's a short distance. Would we stay here again? I would love to - but only if it undergoes a true renovation. Free wifi was great - and we did not have any problems getting onto the internet.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGood concept, badly executed...\u201d", "Author": "unctarheel23", "ReviewID": "UR42154341", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with friends hoping to use the kitchen facilities.

Once again Temperpidic Mattress was great...except now my wife wants one at Home..Thanks Princess! :( Kitchen with full Fridge was great..........Microwave is needed though ! Flat screen TV was great...maybe do a PPV option in the future? Tv in Living room area needs updating........Balcony was nice................ Valet Parking..Great Touch...I glady gave Valets my tip $$ as it made the trip feel \"nice\" ..car was ready in front in like 3 minutes each time,Prof. Staff ! Restaurant......Nice touch to offer 3 meals a day on Premise...plus the Outdoor bar and Lunch area is great touch....Menu should be expanded a little...maybe add kids menu and some crayons !! ROOM SERVICE was great...Price were very fair,service was accurate and fast...........very convient and a major plus !! Front Desk....Service was always freindly and quick...allthough sometimes language barrier was a pain.....I do understand the need to hire some Foreign exchange type staff..wasnt a big deal.......... We did receicve a Cot for free for 3 days due to some issues which I will explain below...But, Cots should be like $5-$10 a day, not $15..no need to make a profit really on the Cot when I spent over $1500 for a week........... Pool area...Atrium with seating area and video games..pool tables was Great !! View of pool and nice softer music was great....Nice Plants and decorations all over the Atrium....we had view of Ocean and Beach..awesome !!! Now, A few Bad Points............. Pool...Green Color was not good...I went in every day but my Wife didnt go on at all..she felt it was kinda nasty looking considering after 20 years of traveling we never encountered a Green Pool...There was no staff at the pool area that would understand Engish so we couldnt ask...should have asked at front desk I guess...I had at least 5 frends say Pool was Blue on Website but Green inur Pics ! Eww....Not good for Potential Vistors to the Princess..Bad First impression !!! Kids loved it...LOL!!!!!! Air Condition.......Bedroom was cool..not Cold! Living room area was kinda warm..not good !! We called for reapirmen 2 t seperate days ,who came up in less than 10 minutes which was great !!! Including once at like Midnight ! They basically adjusted the inner vents and one time said the Compressor had turened off....they admitted that the AC is never Super COld like many Hotels...........we agreed !! AC was non existant in Elevators and Hallways most of our trip !!!! Hot Tub........Inside and Outside were so heavily used it always seemed and looked dirty! Yes, it is a Hotel and used like 12 Hours a Day but maybe Chemicals/filter should be checked like every 3 hours during Peak summer months !! All the Hallways going towards the Rest. were outdated and even the LARGE Glass Chandelier had a 1980's look !! Wow ! A wrote alot !! Bottom line this long review shows my passion for this Hotel and I want to tell others to Go to the Princess Royal...Me and my family will go back....Hopefully to see a few changes made and Esp. to always see a Nice BLUE/Clear Pool.................

Maybe it's because it's a vacation spot, rather than business, and when you're spending your own money rather than the company's you're more particular. Whatever the case, I found the Princess Royale was hardly the dump described by some, but had some (minor) issues for our stay. On the pro side, the beach is RIGHT THERE, as described, and I am surprised that people have not noted what a wide, clean and non-rocky beach it is. We had no problem finding our way through the hotel to the outside. I don't know how you could be confused - the elevator has a sign that clearly states access is through the second floor. The decor is a little cheesy, as noted in other reviews, but my teen kids found it amusing and campy - the velvet chairs, the lighted mirrored ceilings, the pink wall trim, the patterned carpeting. Las Vegas on the Atlantic. I mean, what would you expect from a place called the Princess Royale? It's not going to be like Pottery Barn. The room was very clean, not a bug to be seen, which is an accomplishment at the beach. My kids loved the Tempurpedic beds; my husband was lukewarm but he's never happy with any bed. I liked the little ocean-view balcony outside. What I didn't like is that coffee is provided only for the first day of a stay, apparently, not the second, so I didn't have my morning coffee to drink out there after the first day. Sorry, but that kind of thing makes a difference to me. TVs were nice and I'm one to like granite surfaces on tables, etc., as it makes them easy to keep clean. The parking garage is kind of scary, with ramps at a high angle, but manageable. The toilet in our room made a lot of noise, and seemed to struggle somewhat, but not enough to call in management. Bathroom is nice and big. The indoor pool - well, gotta say it did appear kind of nasty. My daughter went in, and said it was too warm and the water indeed was cloudy. But we were there for the beach, not the pool, and the beach is great. All in all, it was fine for Ocean City, where it's a struggle to locate a decent hotel that's not $400 a night.

The hotel has everything you could want for an enjoyable stay. To begin with, it is right on the ocean...only steps away from the water!! The huge indoor pool and atrium area is the best compared to any others we have looked at, with plenty of tables/chairs to relax, an inside hot tub and two addtional hot tubs out on the deck. This is a great place to be in the winter months, or if it is raining. Their oceanfront restaurant & lounge, Schooners, has great food and they offer different buffets on certain days. We always have their yummy breakfast buffet !! We love the location of Princess Royale because it is more relaxing than being at the boardwalk. You can hop on a bus for a very nominal daily fee to take you to the boardwalk if you don't want to drive. The hotel is close to other fine eateries as well, and you can walk across the street to a supermarket if you cannot find what you need in the hotel convenience store on the first floor. Although we come to Princess Royale at different times of the year, it is especially nice in the summer to relax by their gazebo bar on the lawn under the palm trees, and listen to live music daily.

There is a warning that if the room smelled like cigarette smoke after your stay that you would be charged $200.00. The only problem with this is that the hallways and rooms seem to already have the stench of cigarette smoke from many years past, probably from a time when smoking was still allowed. My unworn clothes have the smell of cigarettes when I came back home. I DO NOT blame the hotel in this regard. People smoke. What can we do.

They claim that they honor specific requests, but they don't. We booked 2 oceanfront rooms, requesting one on a high floor and a quiet room on any floor. We showed up 1 hour after rooms became available, and got 2 oceanfront rooms, but 1 on the first floor and 1 on the 2nd over the restaurant, so not quiet and neither on a high floor. The management said the hotel was booked so too bad. They were very put out when we requested 2 room changes the next day but said they would change our rooms. They acted like they were doing us a favor. The first floor has a very strange layout so I would avoid booking that floor. The a/c wasn't working in the first floor hallway either. The convenience store never seemed to be open when we needed it. We couldn't find water or soda in the vending machines on any floor. We wanted to take some bottles to the beach on such a hot day. The desk clerk told us to go to the convenience store, but it was closed, of course. Our 2nd floor room smelled strongly of smoke even tho the hotel claims it's smoke free.

All in all the Princess Royale was nice. It definitely tends to be more of a family hotel but we enjoyed it even as a couple. The front desk staff are very nice, the rates had changed from our original reservation in August so they did refund us the difference (came out to ~$100). We had a pool side room that was pretty cool. They don't do that in Va Beach so it was unexpected. I thought that the kids playing in the pool during the day would be annoying because of the glass doors that lead to the balcony but we never heard a sound with them closed. There was a nice flatscreen TV in the bedroom area with lots of movie channels. Plenty of hot water with good pressure in the shower. They even had the little knob on the shower head to turn off water flow to conserve water while lathering up. It might have been november but we still got in the outdoor hot tubs that overlook the beach. It was pretty cool. There was some sort of convention going on in the hotel so we got to go use our \"one free drink at the hotel bar\" coupon and laugh at all the drunk older guys trying to pickup the younger ladies. good times!

Other hotels sometimes try to hard and are overbearing with their attempts to make you feel at home. Which in turn make you feel the opposite. The princess just does it without trying. On another note, if you get the chance, eat at Waterman's down across the Route 50 bridge. It's on your right just about a mile after the bridge.

There was very little water pressure and no hot water at all. I chose this hotel from not only being a repeat guest from years ago, but also for the kitchen area. We were traveling with my son who is 1 year. We had to give him an ice cold bath, all his food in the refrigerator had to be thrown out because it was spoiled and he spent the night very overheated due to no air conditioner. The staff at the front desk were nice enough to credit us for the night and gave us hope that this situation would be resolved in the morning. The next morning, Thursday, the staff had informed us that the problems should be resolved that day. However the elevators were not working properly so we needed to walk up and down carrying our 1 year old and stroller throughout the day until the elevators were working. We also did not have use of the pool due to this outage and hotel was unable to provide us with any feeding needs for our son. Finally late in the afternoon we started to get back some of the power. At 9pm we spoke to the front desk about our air conditioner still not work and they then informed us that it had to be reset. However our room did not cool off until the next day and we spent another night with our infant sweating. Thank god by Friday everything was in working order again. This was a huge inconvenience for us especially with having an infant. Not only did he have to sleep in the heat but we had to repurchase food for him, and not having hot water to bath him or heat his bottles was a big problem as well as no lights!

The balcony on the side was very tiny and scary, with these ridiculous hard metal seats, as you would fine in the lawn ornament department at LOWES. Couldn't put your butt on those. Glass mirror doors were falling off and screen had tears in them. The upkeep in the room we stayed (904)was terrible One of the beds broke during the night, the frame was broken.

The carpets were worn and fadded, icicle-like gold chandelier's hung from the ceilings and the typical luxaries of even a motel 6 I didn't find evident. As a business traveler I've seen a fair trade of various accomdations, but the Princess really did not play up to my expectations. Then again, this is a hotel in a seasonal town. The locals love OCMD and all it has to offer. I, personally, find it a mix between family and children, too many all you can eat buffett's, and a crowd that perhaps would be perfectly content with the dangerously slow and shifty elevator at the Princess, the warm indoor poor you just KNOW is filthy with children's pee, and service that does not make any acceptions to making your stay as pleasurable as possible. The highlights: Great temperpedic beds, an outdoor bar that has live music around 1 in the afternoon that you can hear on the beach, a decent location (across from bus stop!) and although not great, probably beats out half the motel-ish dives lining main drag offering small dirty rooms for the same price. The Princess offers all Suites which are all decently sized many of which have balconies (do not recommend staying in the rooms who's balconies face indoors - toward the pool.

It started out very promising. The front desk personnel were very friendly checking us in and were very surprised that our room was ready at 3:30. Went out to unload our car and could not find a luggage cart or bell hop. When a few showed up outside the hotel I and another guest had to approach them for help and felt we were putting them out. Our first night we stayed in a two room oceanfront suite. The room was nicely furnished and appeared clean. As other reviews stated the beds were very comfortable and linens were nice. However, the bathroom was another story. It was clean, but the towels were very rough and thin. The soap \u201cbit\u201d was not usable, the only one in the room was one inch square so be sure and take your own. The physical condition was tired, no remodeling in here. The balcony furniture is the cheap plastic type, felt like it was going to break at any minute. The rest of our stay was to be spent in a condo. Once again the front desk was very helpful in the move and the condo was ready around 1 pm. This time the bell hop was very friendly in helping us move our gear. Once we arrived at the condo, we first noticed that no balcony was visible. We move a certain and there was a 5X6 (est.) balcony looking over the deck and the side looking over the ocean. When I booked this condo I was told there would be a wrap around balcony like the one on the virtual tour on their website. Just like other reviews noted we did not get what we reserved. The furniture was dirty and the living room\u2019s only tv was a small 17 inch and the remote\u2019s back kept falling off. The flat screen was in one of the bedrooms. The fridge\u2019s handle was loose and felt like it would fall off at anytime and the ice maker did not work. When we went into the first bedroom we could not believe what we saw, a window looking out onto the hallway and elevator!!! It was \u201ccovered\u201d with Venetian blinds set into the widow\u2019s opening and did not fully cover the window. In other word you could see into the bedroom!!! We pinned up a towel to cover the window. That night we washed our clothes and the washer worked fine but the drier did not dry our cloths after 12 hours and multiple settings. There was no change in the bathroom then the suite (small soap cheap towels). In the morning I woke up with a plastic strip from a cig. Packet stuck to my side!!! That was the last straw, I wanted to go down to the front desk and discuss our options (no vacancies at other hotels). I had to wait two elevators because the staff had them filled up with maid charts then maintenance. Only one elevator services the condos. I talked to the front desk supervisor and was told no other condo available, but we could move to a room like we had the first night. We move to this room and it was ok with the same issues as the first. As mentioned in other reviews the carpets are very worn. In this room the carpet from the bedroom to the kitchen was so worn that the tacks from the tack strip was worn through so badly I punctured my foot.

During the off-season we find the oceanfront condos to be exceptionally good deals. Where else can you find an oceanfront three bedroom suite with mirrored walls, a huge jacuzzi tub, dining room, kitchen, TWO bathrooms, balcony AND laundry facilities for $200 (plus tax)? We've always found the staff to be friendly and courteous. Admittedly the hotel is not young, but lately great efforts have been made to renovate the place. This coming winter, for example, we've been told the aforementioned condos will be receiving a facelift. If there's any downside it's that the restaurant food (like much of the food in Ocean City) is subpar. The restaurant staff makes up for matters though. For example, last March my wife and I were the only ones present at the hotel's \"Schooner's Oceanfront Lounge and Restaurant\" on a particularly cold and rainy Sunday night. The chef treated us like a King and Queen! It was one of the most romantic experiences of our 21 year marriage! I have no idea why some reviewers give the place a thumbs down.

She was great in answering any questions we had and made us feel welcome:) The lobby is nice and is exactly as portrayed in the pics of their website. Nice floors, deco and cremey white leather furniture w/palm trees surrounding. To the left of the lobby is a small store where you can do a quick pick-me-up of some suits, coverups, bags etc. If you go up a bit further you will see around the corner an exercise room. We did not unfortunately have time to use that as we had too much fun with beach and pool. There is a small convenience store nearby the check-in where you can pick up necessities on a whim..there is also a Super Fresh just across the street adjacent to the hotel. Bathrooms are located near the small convenience store, just around the corner so that was convenient in the case you needed to go before heading up to your room. Elevators were a bit warm inside but nothing to complain about. We were on the 5th floor with an ocean view. They were great in getting us the closest view from the side they could get and we were very happy with what we got:)) Walking into the room we were pleased with the layout...you walk thru the small living room which has a couch, chair w/end tables and coffee table as well as a tv. You also see the kitchen and small connected table w/two chairs. Having a kitchen, especially full size fridge was a must for our vacation! Also a two burner stove stop -- dishwasher was on the smaller scale (we didnt use it -- I brought my own stuf and hand washed). Heck, I didnt even realize there was a dishwasher till the last day! lol They do provide you with dishwashing liquid for dishwasher, I brought my own dish soap). To the left of the kitchen was the bathroom....new granite counters, nice to spread your toiletries out and not feel cramped....everything was provided as well as very clean...another BIG plus in our book!!! In the back was the bedroom w/two queens, dresser, and a chair over in the corner. You also have a flat screen tv in the bedroom which was nice!:)On the floor, in the closet, was a safe, which was nice. You make up your own code to use which makes one feel good. Balcony was slightly smaller then expected (more angled) but no complaint here whatsoever...it is to step out on, appreciate great views, there's room to sit, watch, and listen to the ocean waves, or whatever...just relaxxxxx!~....ahhh the life!:) The hotel is on the beach -- very convenient as well as being a nice bigger sized pool then I've seen -- compared to other places -- the kids loved swimming and making new friends:) The pool is an indoor atrium with big glass which brings the outdoors' feeling inside -- this is a nice touch!! On either sides of the pool, it starts out at 3foot and progresses to 4ft and then to 5ft being the direct center of the pool. I do wish there was more area of the 5ft but I've seen smaller pools and this was fine. The pool area also has a sauna (I didnt use but hubby did) as well as a sit- in small pool which was in an area off to the side of the pool that looked to go maybe 4 ft? I didn't use that as it was pretty full the days we were there. There is a poolside bar for hot dogs, drinks and such. The white lanterns standing up around the outside of the pool area are another nice pretty touch to the atrium area!!! There are bathrooms on each side of the pool area so this makes it convenient and \"clean\" then running up and down hotel hallways getting sand everywhere to go to the bathroom. Another convenience and smart move was having elevators right next to the both sides of the bathrooms for the pool so that you are not tracking sand and all up thru the hotel hallways and into the main elevators...this was a good, smart choice to keep things more contained as far as sand etc. The atrium also has two pool tables, ping pong table (sons said their friends learned you need your own paddle and ball to play though? Im not sure?) as well as other fun arcade games...I had fun with the Lord of the Rings pin ball machine myself! (smile)* Outside of the atrium was a nice HUGE deck with hot tubs on each side (and gated so small children wouldnt get in or get hurt)....lines of chairs overlooking the beautiful palm trees and sand and beach. If you weren't too late being on the deck you'd get to hear the great music from just below where they had the outside area where you could be served food/drinks etc. After awhile it was really getting much easier to get to know which elevators went the easiest or what was more convenient for whatever our purpose was for going and coming. I was taken back on one of the elevators and all I do is laugh now....this is my problem/issue though, Im not great with heights and especially some reason not great with glass elevators...this wasnt too bad though and I actually used the elevator to help do my own therapy! HAHA! Since we were on the 5th floor (top floor) I used it to \"come down\" -- as going \"up\" was more difficult and gave me anxiety (dizzy)...ok stop laughing but true...but Im so proud of myself....as many times I needed to take one or the other kid back up or cool off or grab a bite to eat and need to go to the room from the beach or whatnot...that elevator has brought me back to my home feeling accomplished. Silly sounding I know but I \"DID IT!\" YAYYY! Thanks Princess Royale! You didnt realize you helped someone with a fear huh? TeeHee! :-) I now can go UP as well as go down with less dizziness. :-) I love the fact the hotel is also on the beach....everything is so convenient especially for families .....I know it would be costly but it would be nice to see ALL of Ocean City hotels possibly consider putting small restroom buildings outside -- just as they do down around 1st streets and so on....(so many buildings every few streets -- maybe right as you step on the sand to the side by the fence maybe? This would alleviate strolling into the hotel each time you have a young one that needs to go potty or perhaps yourself....BUT I do have to say Im very pleased that there are at least bathrooms in the atrium...or else I'd have to say it just wouldnt work. You can rent umbrellas, chairs, boogie boards etc till 5pm each day...they just come and pick them up. We just left our stuff out there except our bags with personal items we would bring back with us when we wanted to go swim or grab some quick lunch etc. We had a great stay....I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends....and yes the majority of workers there are foreign but I must say whoever hired these young people did a great job and I told my husband they must seriously put them through good customer service training because even if language might have been a slight barrier they were all VERY courteous, mannerable, polite and respectful not to mention making sure we had any toiletries needed at all times etc. I would be very proud if I were the one who hired them..they seem to be hard workers and do a very good job. Even the last day...leaving.....the hallways were actually filled with many of the maids and the carts etc...but like I told my husband...thats their job and dont WE want them to do their job? Certainly we do..or else....it'd be a quick dirty job and thats not how this place is ....our visit was clean and fun and we'll be coming back again!:)) Only one complaint -- if I had anything negative to say -- and that would have to be the hesitation I had for awhile on getting from the parking garage back to the hotel room and visa versa. The parking garage looks to be that it might have possibly been a hotel before(?) (I could be wrong)...nothing wrong with that but upon realizing you only had one option of getting back to the hotel was to use the \"one hot, very slow\" elevator back down to the ground level to cross the street to go thru lobby to get in elevator to go back up to the 5th floor for your room...and visa versa....BUT...its \"doable\"..... this was the only reason I gave 4 stars then 5. I would like to suggest (but not sure it's possible?) but maybe in the future(?)...there could at least be a walk-over of some sort, from one of the garage floors on over to the \"inside of the hotel\"...this might lessen \"time\" for awaiting elevator for others not to mention more convenient -- OR...at the very least/worst maybe install one more elevator in the garage(?) Thanks for your hospitality....we enjoyed our much needed family vacation! Will be back again:))) PS** I would really LOVE to know the exact name of the TempurPedic mattress you have as I would LOVE to get one for our home!!!

Our room was ready early, a plus. However, when we entered our suite we noticed that it was not what we reserved. We reserved a room with two queen beds, and a view of the ocean. Our room had one king bed, and a view of the indoor pool. My traveling companion called the front desk and asked what happened. The man who answered said that there was some sort of electrical problem and that they moved us to a different room. My companion asked if the room rate was the same, and asked why no one had informed us of the change upon check in. We were not angry over the change, but were quite surprised. We thought we would be getting what we reserved. No one told us we would be getting a room with a different view or a different number of beds. Then man said yes the rate is the same but I will give you a discount for your trouble. We thought that was nice of him. However, he was apparently confused, uninformed, or had no authority to make the decision to give someone any kind of discount. When we went to check out on Wednesday morning, a young man quoted us a total bill. We asked if that reflected any kind of discount and the man behind the counter politely said no, and asked a female manager to assist him. This manager was less than polite. The problem was not what she said. The problem was how she said it. She looked at us and said, \"I have no record of a call from your suite. Besides, I do not know why anyone would tell you that you could have a discount for that. We do not give discounts for that. You only have two people. Of course you would be moved to that room.\u201d I could not believe the tone of voice she used with us. There was no \"I'm sorry someone told you that, he must have been confused\" or polite explanation of some sort of hotel policy. She was angry, impatient, and rude. She acted as if we had lied to her about what one of her co-workers had said. She also seemed to think that it should be obvious to us that we had to move because of the number of people we had staying in our room. I am an adult woman. The person I was traveling with is an adult woman. We are not in an intimate relationship. We did not wish to share a bed. Neither of us particularly felt like sleeping on a pull out sofa either. If I thought I would be sleeping on a sofa, I would have stayed somewhere cheaper than $275 a night. I will never stay at the Princess Royale again. It is not because I know it is quite possible that what I reserve is not what I will get. Problems happen and sometimes you have to move. I will not stay again for two reasons. The first reason is that we should have been informed of the change when we checked in, not discovered it for ourselves in a confused state. The second reason is how incredibly rude and unapologetic the female manager was upon our check out. I will also certainly tell everyone I know not to stay at the Princess Royale, unless of course my friends consider surprise room changes and nasty staff a neat traveling adventure.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda MD USA", "Title": "\u201cSpacious and fun\u201d", "Author": "sasiki1", "ReviewID": "UR18252249", "Content": "This place was awesome, and when say awesome I mean that 11 people could fit in a 2 bedroom pretty comfortably.

The towels & sheets were extremely clean & soft. The beds were temper-pedic mattresses which made me wish I had one at home! The downside was the pool, which was indoors. But, I understand why since the beach is literally right next to the hotel, barely any walking distance from door to sand. The bar near the beach was open with live music and one of the best strawberry daquiris I've ever had. Another problem was the people that worked there barely spoke english and couldn't count american money. The guy at the pool bar had to ask me how to make change and didn't know what a dime was. My friend asked for chapstick with SPF in it for the beach and the woman in the store didn't know what SPF was. Also, skip the breakfast in the hotel, it was awful. There are plenty of other places near the hotel that would offer better breakfast. I only ate there for breakfast so I am not sure how lunch/dinner was. It is also far from the main strip of bars/restaurants and extremely far from the boardwalk. Anywhere you want to go you must take a taxi. Taxis only cost about $15 each way, but still definitely not in the most convenient location. However, this did make the beach extremely peaceful since most of the college crowd stays near the boardwalk & motels over there.

I was really very pleasantly surprised. The hotel was very clean...from the lobby which had a very clean smell to the room itself. I should say I'm a bit OCD when it comes to hotel rooms and cleanliness. I really examine the toilets and shower before going near them, and no problems here. The best part is the convenience of the amenities, especially with a little one. We started everyday with the breakfast buffet at schooner's restaurant (very good and reasonably priced), had lunch each day at the cafe on the green which is very beautiful, and loved being able to buy milk and other things at the conveniece store in the lobby without being way overcharged. We had a room facing the pool/atrium area and you could see the ocean through the atrium windows, My son loved hanging out on the balcony and watching the action. We did not use the pool but it looked clean from where we were. Also the remodeling is very evident and they did a great job. Furniture looked new, the mattress was comfortable and the lcd tv in the bedroom was a nice touch. If i had to pick on something i would say the dishwashers need an upgrade (though i didn't have a need for one) and the bathtub faucet was a bit loose.

Only thing missing is a spa for massages etc.! ;) The view of the ocean is absolutely breathtaking. A few years, the property was a little \"off,\" meaning that we felt like things were rundown and the service was not up to par. We credited that with the fact that we were staying in the off-season. But it seems like the hotel has become much more popular during that weekend (and that may be due to conventions - I believe the boat show is that weekend too) and so we've seen an increase in the attentiveness of the staff, upkeep of the property, etc. It could also be a result of a change in management since we first started staying at the hotel. If so, great job!! One thing we're disappointed about is the outdoor hot tubs. Yes, we do like to get into them even in February! One year we had a most enjoyable soak in the hot water on a brilliantly sunny cold winter's day. But now the water is usually lukewarm (brrr) and the tubs are frequently occupied by children. The same is true for the indoor hot tub. I'd like to see management police that a little more.

During the weekend of our stay, my elderly mother celebrates her birthday which makes our stay even more special.

We had heard a lot of negative things about the hotel but were pleasantly surprised at the lovely hotel (could use a little decorating update) but over all wonderful. I am sorry it has taken me all summer to get around to writing to you to compliment you on your staff.I was impressed at how may exchange students you employed and made a trip to your Personnel office to congratulate you on your decision to use the foreign students. I wish more people in the US understood the program and what these students do. I spoke with your Personnel Director and she informed me about the hiring of the students and the whole process of events take place before the students even arrive. And the fat that you house your students is also wonderful. My husband and I really enjoyed talking to the students. I know I heard a lot of comments from other guest that they were having trouble understanding some of the employees. But I think if they realized that these students choose to leave their families and their cultures behind and come to a strange country alone to work for 3 months and that it cost them to even do this that may be just maybe they would be a little more understanding. And now for the most wonderful of all the people that I met there was Shreen. What a pure joy she was. My children loved her and begged to go to the sore on more then one occasion to play with her. It was hard for me to make them understand that she was working and couldn't play with them. We ran into her on the beach one morning and she spent an hour just playing with them and telling us about her country and family. What an Ambassador she would make and if everyone got a chance to talk to her I think the world would be a better place. What a truly wonderful young women. She says she is studying to biology and wants to be a teacher. I wish my kids yowled have her for a teacher. Your staff made our vacation a lovely one and I want them to know. I am just sorry that it took me so long to sit down and write this and I truly hope you will share it with them. Your Personnel staff and I believe Joanne said the Security Director should be commended on the staff they hired for you summer season. I hope that when we return next summer that some of the same students will be there but if not I look forward to meeting new ones and talking to them about their countries and culture.

Thank goodness I didn't. I was traveling with my husband, two year old son, and my parents, so we wanted a three bedroom condo. No where in Ocean City could you find this for $199. a night with daily maid service. Then I came across the Pricess Royale. We like to travel the week of Labor Day since prices are cheaper. Upon our arrival, the bell staff immediatly came to our cars and quickly unloaded our bags. We had a lot since a two year old requires many toys. The bell man was friendly and very helpful. He waited patiently for about 10 minutes while my husband disconnected the DVD player from the car. I then checked in, where I was greeted by a young friendly girl with reddish hair who was more than happy to help me. I had advised her that we were having a crib delivered from a crib rental company. Some hotels don't like that, but they didn't mind. (my son is just to big for the pack and plays they offer)Later on when the crib was delivered, the bell staff even assisted the lady from the company bringing it up to our condo. When we arrived to our condo, which was HUGE, we were more than impressed. We had three huge bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a dining room, living room, full kitchen, huge ocean front balcony and a washer/dryer. Not to mention the huge jacuzzi in our master bedroom. Which did work nicely and didn't leak. The condo was clean and in full working order. Yes, the towels were mismatched in our condo, but since they were clean, we really didn't care. And yes, the furniture is old and the carpets are stained in areas, but that's really with any older hotel you stay in. The main thing was, everything was clean. The exchange students were all friendly and helpful,and yes, they did speak English. We even asked the young girl at the front desk if we could have our condo made up by 1pm, so my son can take a nap, and it was done. As it was everyday, usually by 11am. We didn't get an attitude or anything. While walking through the hotel, I don't recall an odor. But who knows. My parents ate at Schooners and enjoyed it. My husband and I ordered room service and it came quick and was good. The pool was great, my son loved it! Even when we checked out, the bell staff was there to help and the young girl at the front desk was friendly.

I noticed that this hotel has somebody monitoring and responding to all the negative comments here on trip advisor. If they spent just half that energy fixing our room and giving us clean linens, we'd give this place 4 or 5 stars. I'll start with the bad and then finish with the good stuff. ====Disgusting Linens - Unforgivable Lodging Sin=== When we pulled back the bed covers on both beds, we were literally stunned to see mismatched pillow covers, some gray, some white, some in a wretched off white. In all my travels, I had never seen such a thing. The sheets were wrinkled and not white. This pattern also carried over to the bathroom towels. Very odd and not very clean looking. I had a distinct feeling that things were crawling on that pillow. I thought i was psychological, but I couldn't stand it anymore, so I microwaved the pillows for 15 seconds....yes microwaved. After that I slept just fine. Now that I'm home and I've read another traveler's comments about bedbugs, I'm confident I that I was accurate in my assessment of the linens. ====Pool Linens- 20 thread count?==== If you have a strange curiosity to see what towels look like after 20 years of use, check out the linens at the pool side. After getting out of a cold pool, you're not greeted by soft lush towels. You instead get towels where all the soft cloth fiber has long since abandoned ship, leaving underlying thread base. It has all the sensory feel of low pile commercial office carpet. It literally takes 2 towels to dry off and I'm only 150 pounds, 5'8\". ====General Facilities==== The hotel has a very old feel to it. The place must have looked fantastic 20 years ago, but this place has a distinctly old musty feel with a tinge of moldy odor.. When we got up into the room areas, my kids immediately asked \"Why does it smell so bad up here?\". My daughter occasionally took to walking the halls pinching her nose. ====Bathroom - Locker Room Quality Cleanliness==== Where do I start on this one? The floor tiles and tile grout were filthy and stained. Slightly more difficult areas of the bathroom to reach, i.e. sides & back of toilet, corners, were even dirtier. It was so dirty, it made your toes curl up in fear. The toilet seat had permanent scuff marks on them. ====Shower & Bath Follies==== When I pulled up on the tab to send water to the shower head, the entire bath spout pulled out of the wall! All in all, we were quite happy to escape a 5 day stay there without athlete's foot. The shower head \"featured\" one of those water saving spouts from the 1980's. Just to refresh your memory, these are the type that have the roar of a jet engine punctuated by the needling of your skin with a pressure washer. It was impossible for the kids to take a shower, because by the time the water reached them it misted into the air. Painful. None of us relished the end-of-the-day shower. ====Beach Access - Passable==== Any of the beachfront hotels have decent beach access. Unfortunately, you have to navigate a maze of hallways to get to the beach. When we finally found a shortcut, it got us down to beach level, but then required a strange ascent of stairs a traverse of the sun-deck and finally a flight of stairs back down to beach level. With kids, and beach gear, this felt like a thousand mile march each time to and from the beach. ====Minor Annoyances==== -The room had two televisions, but only one remote control. -Aside from one voucher for a free packet of coffee, this was an additional charge item. ====Other Room Comments==== If you look in upper corners of the room, there seems to be a history of mold and mildew. I couldn't be certain, but there was some funky colored stuff going on there. ====Pool - Passable==== Looks great in the pictures on the web, but beware that by 4pm, so much crap has made its way into the pool that you can't even see your feet. Even at 10am, your feet are barely visible. It's the kind of pool where you cringe each time you accidentally swallow water. ====Full Kitchen - Nice==== The full kitchen is great for families. It was the highlight of the hotel. It's sad to say, but that was the best feature of the place. -Full size microwave -Full size refrigerator -Electric stovetop -Garbage ====Minor Niceties==== The full size safe was a nice touch.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLetter sent to Princess Royale Hotel after our stay\u201d", "Author": "DCskadoodle", "ReviewID": "UR8537447", "Content": "Here is a letter that I sent to the management of the Princess Royale after an offseason stay. If prior reviews are any indication, my closing argument seems particularly insightful. Dear Sir/Madam, During a recent getaway from the Baltimore-Washington area to Ocean City, Maryland, my fianc\u00e9e and I decided to stay at the Princess Royale Hotel. This was not our first stay at your establishment, and previous trips to your hotel have produced at least moderate levels of satisfaction; simply put, your hotel is always a viable option for our weekend stays in Ocean City. However, with our most recent stay at your hotel, occurring on the 3rd weekend of January 2007; our experience was so unsatisfactory that, with the sheer number of other options for accommodation in Ocean City, we have more than likely booked our last room at the Princess Royale Hotel. Housekeepers aimlessly roamed the hallways at all hours of the day and night, speaking loudly amongst themselves, hardly the morning wake-up call we requested. In fact, they spent the better part of the morning coalesced right outside of our door, which seemed to serve as the proverbial \"water cooler,\" where the gossip mill turned, but it is safe to say, no work was getting done. Later in the day, just when my fianc\u00e9e and I settled down to a relaxing night of reading and conversation over coffees, the housekeeper's vacuums roared to life, piercing the evening's ambiance. Eleven at night is a completely ridiculous time to catch up on the chores, don't you think? A little respect for your paid customers would certainly be appreciated from time to time. Your Jacuzzi had about as many bubbles as a can of Sprite left in the hot sun for several days, turning the hot tub into a communal bath tub, with water warm and stagnant, a memorable experience to be sure, but by no means refreshing. Maybe if we had remembered to bring our candles and loofa pads, our time in the \"hot tub\" would have been more enjoyable. But for the purposes of this letter, you could almost see the urine rising to the surface. We enjoyed the company of hundreds of seemingly unaccompanied children wandering at high speeds throughout the hotel. While we certainly understand that large groups need a place to stay, the hotel should make clear to all adults who bring children that the hotel and its facilities are not their personal playground and that the adults will be held accountable for their children's failure to behave in a manor fitting a hotel that dares to call itself a \"fantastic resort.\" A laundry list of other shortcomings in our stay at the Princess Royale could be attached, but I will include just these few: our toilet was in a constant \"state of flush,\" requiring an equally constant \"state of fill,\" the noise of the water ripping us from our gentle slumber as if the great falls of Niagara were upon us. The bathroom door left much to be desired, including such basic articles of \"doorness\" as a knob and lock. The elevators seemed to be in the same state of reluctant duty as the housekeepers, and hundreds of immature children with a lifelong zeal for mindless button-pushing didn't help matters much, either. When we left the room to venture into the pool, I am pretty sure it was winter. By the time the elevator landed on the pool level, a balmy spring thaw had set in. The games by the pool are supposed to be closed at 11pm, but along with the vacuum, they sang their merry electronic tunes long into the night, and of course were accompanied by the delighted screams of the children who had found new buttons to push. The Princess Royale was a fine hotel ten to fifteen years ago when I first came through your doors. In that time, your facilities have aged, the distinct smell of mustiness has permeated the place, and your hotel has generally taken a turn towards mediocrity. In a town with as many options as Ocean City, a hotel as slip-shod as yours is surely not long for this world.

How can you run out of washclothes during the busiest part of the season?! I had enough at this point and ended our stay and vacation early.

We just returned from our 8/07 5-night stay and I can tell you that our experience was excellent, AGAIN. Right from the moment we arrived, the front desk staff was very helpful in getting us checked in as quickly as possible -- even before the quoted 4pm time (we got lucky). Our Oceanfront Suite was exactly what we requested - upper floor, non-smoking. Now, the thing that's key here is that the non-smoking rooms smell fresh and clean and there's no trace of smoke. That's not the case in other resort hotels from my experience. We had great weather ! Avg temps high 80's and plenty of sunshine. Princess Royale has a great beach with the best waves for the kids to boogie board. We took advantage of the beach side \"snack bar\" for some Margaritas (very well done!). Even the bar staff is highly attentive. The rave review has to be for Schooners restaurant. Schooners at the Princess Royale has the best breakfast in Ocean City -- without a doubt. We always order off the menu rather than the buffet. My son loves their fluffy large stack of pancakes and my daughter is a fan of their Texas French Toast. Personally, my wife and I like their omelettes and eggs etc. With an avg cost of about $ 35 for 4 for a really nice breakfast, you have to try Schooners for the food -- and the service. The waitstaff are primarily exchange students and they are the nicest and most interesting people. We met a delightful waitress from Russia and I can tell you it's fascinating to speak with someone who is seeing our Country for the first time. Some of these students had never even seen an Ocean! (I like the fact that the Hotel gets involved in this program -- yes, they benefit however the Students do to. My read was that this is a win-win and as the customer, I benefit too.) Hotel parking was abundant. I managed to get the same spot in the garage the whole trip. Other places you MUST visit in Ocean City while staying at the Princess Royale include: - Ocean City Amusement Pier and Boardwalk. - Olive Tree Restaurant (for family Italian Food) - Lombardi's (across street) for best pizza in Ocean City - Atlantic Stand and Thrashers fries for a casual lite dinner. - JR's for bbq ribs and chicken (get the full rack !)

While we found the hotel be adequate there are several issues they need to address. First, no guest should have to request clean pillows. Ours we all stained and very very warn and flat. Second, the bedspread was also stained and was never replaced. Third, the bathtub showerhead was fine if you liked to be sand blasted every day. It was very old and had not been repaired in years. Fourth, our final night there we had no hot water. We paid plenty for a jacuzzi room and could not use it that night. Fifth, DO NOT be fooled by the video of their jacuzzi room. It seemed as though they just decided to pull the extra bed from the room and throw in a heart-shaped jacuzzi. We had to actually climb on the jacuzzi to get to the air conditioner controls! What a pain and how dangerous is that!!! Sixth, we found the font desk employees to be very unfriendly. While we realize they see hundreds of people in a season, it just seems to us that a friendly hello and enjoy your stay with us would be in order. Also, upon leaving they could not care less that you even were there. How about a friendly \"how was your stay and hope to see you again\" attitude. Maybe they need better training in the hotel industry. Now that we have said all that, let us tell you some things we did like. The Hotel is very convenient to the beach and has and very nice pool area. We did notice that they kept our room fairly clean and the grounds in general were maintained. The oceanfront view was nice and we enjoyed having a balcony were we could have our morning coffee and view the ocean also. Having a kitchenette was nice too. All in all, I would say if you stayed in one of their oceanfront king suites you would not be to disappointed but just be aware this is not a moden hotel and deperately needs a total up-grade.

Once again, we were really lucky that the weather cooperated and we spent most of our time on the beach. This year, we decided that since we found most of the food in the area to be lousy and overpriced, we would make use of the kitchen in our suite. It was great to get up eat some cereal and then find our perfect spot on the beach, all before 10am. It was even better to just run up to the room for a quick lunch. My hubby and kids mastered the microwave for their tv dinners. We ate dinner our first night at the Schooner Restaurant, we opted for the regular menu rather than the buffet. Dinner for 4 cost about $40, for hamburgers, fried shrimp and a philly cheesteak sandwich. The service was quick and the food was good. We even were able to make use of the bar in the hotel one evening. Again, the service was quick and friendly and the drinks were priced accordingly. The indoor pool was great, and all the games were working. The kids enjoyed the pool and ping pong tables. One complaint, the rooftop mini golf is no longer in use. I couldn't get a reason for this, no one seemed to know, but we wound up going to another place. Our rooms were very clean and well maintained. The towels could be updated to ensure that all sets matched. Again, a small complaint, since we usually take at least two showers on a beach vacation, it would have been nice to have two sets of towels. Since the hotel was at full capacity, it was a bit of a challenge to get all we needed, but the housekeeping staff always came through. We had a poolview room, and it was nice to have a balcony, though we didn't use it often since it was very small. Another nice feature offered by the hotel is the changing room. We always arrive in the early morning. Check in is not until at least 4pm, so we bring a beach bag with bathing suits and towels, change in the changing room, and then spend the day at the beach until our room is ready. In fact, this year our room was ready by 2:30 and we were having such a great time at the beach, we didn't check in until about 4! All in all, I find the staff to be very concered about their guests and making sure that all are happy and feel safe.

It was extremely hard to find anywhere to stay in OC, but I did find an ocean front room at the Princess Royale. After booking (and within less than 7-days from arrival, meaning the deposit would have been non-refundable), I started reading the reviews here. Given how unfavorable many of the comments are, I was NERVOUS! I am a very picky traveler when it comes to where I stay, with cleanliness at the very top of the list of things I need out of a place in order to enjoy it. Based on what I was reading, I really didn't know what to expect. Our stay at the Princess Royale got off to a bit of a rocky start when we attempted to check in. The agent I booked with on the phone told me that check-in was at noon. But when we arrived at noon, we were told that check-in is not, and never has been anything but, 4:00. That is clearly posted in the lobby, so nobody could explain why anyone would have told me noon. They did offer the use of changing rooms so that we could get ready and go to the beach, which is what we would have been doing anyway. Not a huge deal. It would have just been nice to have known this ahead of time so that I could have packed one bag with our beach gear, rather than everyone having to dig through suitcases in the car to find this stuff. The other point of contention upon check-in was the availability of a non-smoking room. The agent who booked us did not ask a smoking preference (which should be a standard question, in my opinion), and in my desperation to just find a place at all, I didn't think to mention it. (That shouldn't be the responsibility of the guest, though.) We did think of it on the trip in, and asked at check-in. It turns out that we were indeed booked in a smoking room, but they offered to add an air purifer/ionizer, and open the balcony doors and ocean front screens to air it out while they prepared it for us. I was very doubtful about this making any difference as any non-smoker knows how smoke permeates EVERYTHING in a room, but I must say it worked to my satisfaction. In fact, we have stayed in \"non-smoking\" places that smelled of smoke more than this room did. The whole place is obviously not new, and while the appointments in the room were nothing to write home about, it was definitely clean. It's saying a lot when I say that, because I know I'm not the easiest to please when it comes to this stuff. Again, things are not new. The towels and linens did look tattered at times, but they were always clean. So not the luxury you might expect for the price you pay here, but at least it's clean! The one thing that IS nice enough to specifically mention is the wonderful bed! I see that a lot of other reviewers have mentioned the same thing, so I won't go into great detail, but the rave reviews the beds are getting are definitely warranted. The comfort of my sleep made up for a lot of small details that I found not so impressive. One other person did mention how LOUD the air conditioning unit right beside the bed is. This is TOTALLY true! I slept with cotton balls in my ears, which had all of us laughing hysterically, but it did help! The public areas of the hotel - aside from the front lobby - were not particularly spotless, but I don't really hold this against the place. That many people and that much sand and water would make keeping many of these areas totally clean a really ongoing battle. Housekeepers were always visible working everywhere, so I definitely don't think any shortcomings are from lack of effort. Small things could use more attention, though. For instance: Cleaning the fingerprints on the glass of the front doors, every hour if need be, would require very little effort and make a much more inviting entrance, and just a little more TLC when it comes to things like a coat of paint here or rubbing off a scuff mark there would make the huge difference. Then again, management might feel those things are not important if they stay full, at the going rate, with things exactly as they are. But attention to these details could make all the difference between me calling this an \"OK\" place, or a \"really nice\" place when recommending it to others or deciding whether to return myself. The hotel is on a nice stretch of beach, and the view from our room and balcony was great. The outdoor area near the beach (i.e. sundeck, lawn area, live entertainment, outdoor bar, etc.) made for a fun-feeling atmosphere. The drinks at the bar are EXPENSIVE and not very good, though! No complaints about the staff. They met our needs just fine, and most were friendly. The only thing about the place that we found flat out unappealing was the indoor pool/hot tub area. The water was an off color and very cloudy. I'm sure the person who writes back and defends the place when any negative comments are made will disagree with this, but that won't change the fact that it was very uninviting to us. I'm sure all of the sand that must get tracked into it has a lot to do with it, but it was sure nothing we cared to get into. The hot tub was even worse looking, but then again I'm not a fan of public ones in even the best kept places. I must say that both the pool and the hot tub were always full, so obviously a lot of people were not bothered by the appearance. I guess it's all in your tastes, but this just didn't look good to us. With the beach right outside, though, I can't imagine wanting to be in an indoor pool anyway! So while this is not by far the nicest place we've ever stayed, it was OK in all of the areas that mean the most to us on a trip like this.

The huge difference was the quality of the international staff. In addition to being incredibly friendly and polite, their English comprehension was superb. Not once did they get a room service order (which we ordered every day) incorrect, and there were no struggles in making myself understood. This was also true of the housekeeping staff. Although their ability to *speak* English wasn't quite as good, their comprehension was fine. (We can't speak for the restaurant wait staff, as we don't eat there anymore. For some unknown reason, the room service menu is actually more varied than in the restaurant. It's always been that way. If you want a sandwich for dinner, you call room service or walk next door to Layton's Diner.) The Princess will no longer guarantee smoking rooms. However, I called the Friday before we arrived to ask if I could call on Monday as we were leaving to ask that they block us a smoking room. Martisha agreed, and although she wasn't available on Monday, Brandy blocked one for us a few hours before we arrived. As one of the 20% of Americans who still smoke, this was VERY much appreciated. Kudos to Martisha and Brandy. We encountered two minor problems during our stay: 1) no remote for the living room TV and, 2) toilet overflowed. They were resolved promptly and professionally. However, what really impressed us was their handling of my complaint about the mattress on the sofa bed. While you're never going to get a great mattress on any sofa bed, sometimes you get a really old, squished up one. In no time, housekeeping (or maintenance, not sure which dept.) brought in a much better replacement. They seemed to genuinely want to make me more comfortable and apologized for the bad mattress. The king mattress in the bedroom is amazing. The downside: The Princess needs a fair amount of cosmetic work in the rooms. We don't understand why the hotel doesn't do a few of what we think are less expensive upgrades, such as replacing all the mismatched towel sets, the creaky pedestal TV stands (from 1992) in the bedrooms, or the straight shower curtain rods with the outwardly curved ones that give the feeling of much more room in the shower. It's been a long time since we've seen a simple toaster in the kitchen area of our suite. I'd chalk that up to a potential fire hazard and having been banished for insurance reasons, but other suite hotels provide them. The last time I requested one, I was told that they're no longer available. Tech-wise, the hotel isn't exactly in the 21st century: 1) This is the first year we could access their hi-speed $10/day Internet, and the first screen you got was a huge warning notice about not warranting anything (including viruses and the ability to connect). Well, yeah, that's SOP in hotels . . . but it's another one of those things that makes the Princess look a bit cheesy For any guest who's stayed in other suite hotels, you know that (generally speaking) you're likely to pay a $10/day fee with no guarantee. Hotels that say it's free have actually built some-or-all of the fee into the room rate. But sheesh, this notice was over-the-top. As we still sub to AOL, we used dial-up. Not a great solution, but there's a minuscule connection fee for local calls, and this year my husband didn't have to do much business work while on vacation. 2) When they remodeled in 2003, they finally got new TVs, but then they kept the smaller-screen TVs in the bedroom. Unless you're propped up into a full sitting position, you can't see the TV from the bed. The cable system is great, but the TVs can't get channels above channel 58, AMC. That eliminates the very popular A&E and History Channels, plus a few more. Not sure why the hotel techs can't make adjustments to receive all channels, but I've been told by them that they can't. Needless to say, there's no ability to check (via the TV) your bill. 3) The telephones are ancient. The one in our living room didn't have the index printed on it, so we had to use the bedroom phone to call room service, etc. Having said all of the above, now that they once again have a terrific staff, the hotel gives you good value for your money. All the gadgets and cosmetics in the world don't compare with having a staff that goes out of its way to make your stay enjoyable. Honestly, we plan on staying there again next year. Instead of this being our last year and our swan song, we're looking forward to summer 2008.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesapeake Beach, Md.", "Title": "\u201cCaveat Emptor\u201d", "Author": "Airbornewwiiol", "ReviewID": "UR8254399", "Content": "Initially this was a three page review. My wife told me I should whittle it down because no one will care about the details. So here it is. 2007 Princess Royale - Class 101 . . . We made reservations for an ocean front, non-smoking, single king size with a pull-out couch, and a balcony. We also made it very clear it would be a late check-in.). It was at this point things started to go wrong. The reservation \u201cspecialist\u201d cut her off and said \u201cOh yes, there will be someone here to check you in.\u201d Well that was not the point, but apparently the point was lost on the reservation \u201cspecialist\u201d. After a couple hours drive we arrived and as always, in the summer, the valet staff is mainly comprised eastern Europeans, and new for this year, kids from the Middle East which is great because it gives me a chance to talk to kids from across the pond which I always enjoy. However, waiting ten minutes for a valet to even acknowledge us was, to put it mildly, frustrating. Finally we got a valet, and after some finagling we got a bellman as well. While I supervised the unloading of the luggage my wife went to check in. Arriving at the front desk I find my wife trying to explain to the attendant that we had reserved a non-smoking room. He, however, is in the process of telling her the only room available is a smoking room on a smoking floor and that \u201creservations\u201d are not guaranteed. That\u2019s when I broke in. \u201cExcuse me but you are you telling me reservations are not guaranteed?\u201d He quickly corrected himself and said \u201cRoom Requests are not guaranteed\u201d. Being baffled, I asked him what \u201ca room request\u201d actually was. Suddenly the desk clerk educated me on Princess Royale policy and I was told requesting a certain size bed (as in a king size), ocean front/ocean view, or smoking or non-smoking counted as a \u201csimple request\u201d and not a reservation. So there we are . . . begging the desk attending to fill our reservation. The desk manager came out and offered to help the attendant find us a non-smoking room. Oh, and if there is a corporate officer from the Princess Royale reading this, do everyone a favor and make sure your desk manager speaks fluent English okay thanks. It was at this point the manager told us again the only room they had was on a smoking floor, but that it was okay because it wouldn\u2019t smell like smoke. They offered to give my wife a key to go \u201ccheck out\u201d the room. She took them up on that offer and came right back down stairs saying the whole floor was thick with smoke. This went on for at least a half hour, all the while the other attendants are checking people in and I am thinking . . .why don\u2019t you tell them their reservation is not guaranteed and give us their room and let them deal with this crap. Finally they found us a king size bed in a non-smoking room. Unfortunately it was a pool view. \u201cFine\u201d we said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take it\u201d. I didn\u2019t realize haggling was part of the reservation process in Ocean City but apparently it is at the Princess Royale. We got our keys and headed upstairs. Upon arriving at our hole in the wall we found the room they stuck us in was at one corner of the pool with no balcony. We took the room because it was all they would give us so we went off to the elevators. Elevators at the Princess Royale are a big deal because they only have two for each side of the hotel and it takes forever to get one and once you do it is almost guaranteed to stop on every single floor on the way down. Not only that but the house keeping crew uses the same elevators as the guests so you\u2019ll have to be prepared to move over when the cleaning crew gets on. Not a big deal but defiantly annoyance. Now on to the room, did I mention the lack of balcony? After taking the room we decided we wanted to switch hotels (go figure) and started looking through the phonebook and hitting the net to find one which was more family friendly (more on the family friendly aspect later). As I was on the phone my wife informed me that if we checked out at this point (fifteen minutes into the stay) they were going to charge us for the entire time we had reserved (sorry requested) anyway. Well crap, I guess we are stuck, so we tried to make ourselves at home. At about 10:30pm the phone rings. It\u2019s a Princess Royale quality assurance person calling to make sure everything is all right. My wife took the call because I am sure she didn\u2019t want me picking up that phone. She told her that everything was not fine and that we had major issues. The quality assurance person said in her best Russian accent \u201cOh.\u201d After a few more \u201coh\u2019s\u201d the line went dead and we never head from the quality assurance people again. Off to the bathroom, ant infestation anyone? Mold by the toilet anyone? Cleaning crew staging in the hallway screaming at each other at 6:00am in the morning? Up until this point I have been giving you first hand information. Now let me relay some of the other things I heard while talking to others who were staying there at the same time. Smoke detectors going off in rooms multiple times in a single night. Water main breaks which flooded the seafood buffet and people not being refunded their money, and no air conditioning in several rooms. In the end I have to say, I do have some fond memories of the Princess Royale, but I will never ever EVER again stay there again. Finally, I will never recommend it to any of my coworkers, friends, or family. If you choose to stay there remember the Latin axiom . . .

We spent a long weekend visiting relatives in the area, and booked it as a place to shower and sleep, period. It met those needs, period. We had no problems with the personnel, but we had no reason to make any special requests, either. The reservation was honored when we arrived, and the checkout folio was found under our door early on the morning of our checkout. The room was clean. The place had a musty/stuffy/fake air freshener smell, and I could not wait to get a breath of fresh air in the morning. I woke up every hour the second night and thought \"I can't wait to get out of here\". At 7 a.m., I said \"everybody up!\" The suite was a small living area with no windows, a peninsula counter as a table that would seat two, a galley kitchen near the bathroom, and a bedroom with one slider and two queen beds. The galley had a full refrigerator (a relatively small one), a two burner cooktop, a tiny dishwasher, a microwave, no oven. The decor of the whole place is dominated by dusty rose and glitz and mirrors, probably from the early 1980s. The balconies have resin chairs, the stacking kind that you can buy in a discount store or large supermarket for $10 each. The bedroom TV is visibly bolted to a metal stand. They have a notice in the bathroom that the towels (nothing luxurious) contain metal filament and an alarm will go off if you try to swipe them. The beach towels available in the pool area were the cheapest of cheap, and very well worn. The pool was cloudy. Not sandy; cloudy, to the extent that it impaired visibility at the bottom, and as if they need to adjust their chemicals or infuse a lot of fresh water. You are your own lifeguard, but in a properly lifeguarded pool, you don't let people swim if you can't see the bottom. The pool is surrounded on one side by coin-operated video game machines, so when you are in the pool, you look up and see the black backs of the machines. The elevator jolts and lurches a bit. They are situated on a nice stretch of beach. All we needed was a place to shower and sleep, so it met those very limited needs, but I did not find it enjoyable to be there and I would not relish a vacation there. Personal preferences and budgets vary greatly, but If you are accustomed to high end hotels, this certainly isn't one. Nor is it a solid business-class hotel, like a Marriott or a Sheraton. Nor is it a fresh, modern Hampton or Hilton Garden Inn. Ocean City is not a year-round vacation area. They have a few very busy months where I suppose they make most of their money from a semi-captive market -- the DC and Philadelphia area vacationers who want a reasonably short drive to a nice beach -- and the properties in that area seem to get away with very high rates and temporary help during that time. The rest of the year is very quiet there, and some properties are open, but I suppose the economics of trying to maintain a nice, updated property are limited when you don't have twelve months of solid bookings. They also seem to nickel and dime you -- a dollar for every phone call, and they wanted $18 to receive a ten page fax. I have noticed that their management seems to respond to every TripAdvisor review, and I guess it's nice that they're interested, but it also seems as if they want to argue with guests and have the last word in a forum where travelers are sharing personal opinions with other travelers.

Given the price of the Princess Royale, one would assume that it would be a pretty good hotel. We walked into the hotel, and had no problem with check-in. Little did we know what was waiting for us in our room: the strongest smell of mold and mildew. Ladies and gentlemen, this smell was strong enough to make your eyes WATER. Second, we booked a suite. Apparently a suite at this hotel was the equivalent of a standard room at any other. Its okay, we can put up with the room not being up to par. Thats perfectly fine. Originally, we had booked a one week stay at the hotel. The first night of our stay, a relative called to tell us that my grandmother had died. Ofcourse, we realized that we would have to cut the vacation short and go home as soon as possible. I went downstairs to inform the hotel staff that we would be checking out early because of an emergency situation. Keep in mind that I was grieving at this time, and did not need some one to be as rude to me as she was. She informed me that we could not check out the next day unless we agreed to pay for our full weekly stay. I went on to inform her that my grandmother had died and it would be impossible to stay. She was completley stoic, and offered absolutely no sympathy to our situation. She said, that in order for us to pay for only the night that we stayed at the hotel, we would have to bring in my grandma's death certificate. COME ON!!!

The one bdrm ocean view unit IS long and narrow, but that seems to be the norm in hotels these days. The beds were comfortable, but the bottom sheet wasn't fitted, and constantly came off. The full size fridge was nice. The angled balcony is quite small and just fits two chairs; it is not private. The pool was working; the hot tub had to be repaired that morning. I saw no bugs, and I was looking. I was not informed 'over the phone' of the $.99 safe fee, but it was clearly listed on the form I initialed at check in. (It was NOT brought to my attention, I just knew from Trip Advisor to look for it.) I've read most of the other reviews and my guess is they paid full inseason summer rates, or very high off season rates. The rates listed on the Royale's website shows the 1 bdrm ocv unit I stayed in rents for as high as $279 a nite, in season. Honestly, if I had paid that much, I would have been dissapointed in the balcony size, and for that kind of money, complimentary coffee/sugar/creamer should have been provided, one roll of papertowels and dish soap, a couple of bottled waters, and some high end shampoos and soaps---something to make one feel good about spending that kind of money in season. (Of course, they want you to purchase all that from their store.) And that, I think is the problem. The reviewers spend so much, and get so little as far as extras, they're quite disappointed. I also find it quite interesting to read management's response. It seems VERY defensive, which is telling. It defends itself after every bad reveiw, and basically, blames the guest for being unhappy. I would think that management would have been far better off \"comping\" the room and making happy customers, than arguing with an unhappy guest only to offer them 10% off a future stay. When I commented (at checkout) about the a/c unit in our room causing the carpet to get quite wet, the male check out person said \"Oh, that shouldn't happen.\" He, however, didn't even apologise, and honestly, I felt Like he blamed me for the problem. (And no, I didn't complain or ask for compensation. We didn't even notice until the second nite, as the A/c unit is against the wall near the bed) The bottom line: the rooms are fine, but you will not get anything special for the price you're paying.

I really hate to defend the place, but most of what people are saying is simply not true. We only stayed two nights, but we found no rats or mice anywhere. We did not find the decor outdated. Compared to most OC hotels this place is quite modern. There was no peeling wallpaper or delapadated rooms either. Our room was quite immaculate. There are employees here that speak with an accent, but none that we encountered had any trouble speaking english. If you consider an speaking with an accent not \"english\", perhaps you should get out more. However... Starting from the outside in: The parking garage is a fiasco; steep inclines and declines from level to level. If you're driving a low rider, or even a lower sportscar you won't get out of it from above the ground floor, you'll bottom out for sure. I nearly did. The spots are tiny, but that's to be expected in most hotel parking garages, no big deal. The lobby is great, sure it is of a slightly higher class than the rest of the hotel, but aren't most hotel lobbies? Now the real problems started. We were in a ground floor 100 level room (the reservation promised a room between levels 2 and 5, but i let i would let it slide as long as the room was nice). After scanning the room keys the person at the desk gave me directions to the room, but when i followed those directions i could not find it. You would think that you would be able to get to a ground floor room directly from the lobby. No such luck. There are signs on the walls, \"To suites xxx-xxx\", but they were little help. We're not stupid people either, as there were others there in the same situation. To get to 100 level rooms you have to take the main lobby elevator to the second floor, walk to the other end of the second floor and take that elevator back to the first level, THEN, you're there. After roaming the hallways for about 15 minutes we finally stumbled across our room...only to find the keys did not work. I wondered back in the direction we came and eventually found the lobby. The receptionist rescanned the keys and said she'd send security up to make sure we got in. Again, i wondered around looking for the room. When i finally found it the keys again did not work. The Security person was only a few minutes behind me and was able to open the door with his master key. He did something to the inside of door and was finally able to get the other keys working. The point is that this would not have been such a task had the room not been located in west-hell. If you go to this hotel, please, don't get a 100 level room, ESPECIALLY if someone in your party has mobility issues. The room itself was very nice, clean and decent sized. The room was a dual queen with kitchenette and sitting area, ground floor patio. I don't see this as a small room as someone else said. It is narrow, but deep. Looking in some of the other rooms when housekeeping was in, it looks like the king rooms have a bigger sitting area and a larger room overall. The hallway outside the room was a different story. I don't know if we were directly above the kitchen or what, but from when we arrived to when we left there was an overpowering smell that was hard to differentiate whether it was fish, or garbage. Atrium: If you're looking for a quiet, romantic vacation i wouldn't reccomend the Princess Royale. The pool area/atrium/game room is packed with kids. The pool is large, but very little room to enjoy it with all the kids playing basketball, throwing the football, etc. There is also a hot tub in the atrium, which was packed, and two saunas. There are two hottubs outside the atrium, one was in use and the other seemed to be shut down for the season. It's cool to have some sort of recreation in the hotel, but here is where they really need improvement. The games are dated and barely working, and at least two of them took our money. There are two pool tables that barely work, some balls wouldn't come out, playing 8-ball short one ball. At one point the table ate the cue ball and didn't return it for about 15 minutes. One of the cue sticks was broken at the end, could've lead to a nice splinter for someone. The ping-pong table was nice, everyone loves some ping-pong. The only problem was that you had to find your way to the lobby again to RENT the paddles and balls from the convenience store. It's only $2 to rent, but the attendant there will be sure to remind you to \"Chase after the balls, if you lose one it's $1\"...NICE. You'll also be asked whether you want to leave a drivers license or a $10 deposit for the \"equipment\", DOUBLE NICE! In our case, we checked the table to make sure it was empty before renting. We rented, only to find upon getting back to the atrium that someone was already on the table. It was already after 10 when we rented, with the atrium games closing at 11pm. It would have been nice if the lady told us that someone was already using the table. The pool/game area is definately one of the weak points of the hotel. Also, regarding the rooms that are advertised as \"ocean-view/pool-view, view the ocean through the windows of our atrium\"....not a chance. The atrium windows are constantly fogged from the humidity of the pool room, you'll never catch a glimpse of the ocean in there. I do agree with what one reviewer said of the feeling of being Nickeled and Dimed. You pay alot and don't get much in return. The convenience store was average priced, but it's a neccesity. There is a coffee maker in the room, but no complimentary coffee in the rooms, something you find even at 2 star hotels. You want coffee, you BUY @ 95 cents a cup from the store. There IS a 99 cent charge for the safe in each room, something i did read on the reciept, but something i had no code to, and something i never even even saw. It's ridiculous to charge for amenities in your hotel such as the ping-pong table...if it's listed on your website, offer it free. There was one small bottle of shampoo/conditioner in the room. Other hotels normally give you enough for your stay. You're kinda screwed if more than one person needs it to wash their hair. The vending machines are few and far between in the hotel, and are overpriced as most vending machines are. This again leads you to the \"convenience\" store if you need a snack or drink. There is a sign in the bathroom that tells you bath towels should not leave the room, towels are available in the atrium. We honestly expected to be charged for towel rentals when we got there. There is room service in the hotel, but there is an 18% gratuity fee, a X% other fee, and another X% fee if you order. I'm pretty sure this is standard in many hotels now, but i'd really like to have the option to stiff the guy if i get bad service. Alot of writing for a two-night trip...Overall I think the Con's outweigh the Pro's here. Sure, you get a nice hotel on a decent beach, but you really do feel as if you're being pressured to spend, spend, spend. Which could be understandable, it is a business after all. But never in my travels have a experienced that feeling the way I do here.

We had several issues about our room and when we checked out, the manager at the front desk was demeaning when we addressed our complaints. We arrived on Wednesday, October 26th about 4:00pm. We were told we had been upgraded to a suite, room 703. Upon entering the rooms, we were disappointed that we did not have a front sliding door view of the ocean, but a side view. We always pick a hotel with the slider on the front as we love waking up to the view of the ocean. We had asked for an ocean front, non-smoking room with our reservation. However, rather than go back to the front desk and complain, we decided we could live with this, even though it was not what we had asked for. We put our things away in the closet and drawers and then went out for supper. We were tired as we had a ten hour trip to get to Ocean City from North Carolina where we live. When we returned from supper we sat down to watch some TV and I said to my husband that I was going to put a little heat on as the room was chilly. When I turned the heat on nothing happened. My husband looked at the furnace in the closet and there was ice all over the coils, so we assumed the unit was froze up. We called the front desk and they said they had no one to repair the unit that night, but they could move us to another room. Because of the long day we had, we were not thrilled, but packed everything up from the closet, drawers and bathroom and were moved to room 803, which was a smoking room and was very dirty looking. Upon entering room 803, the heat was running at over 80 degrees, the carpet had spots on it and the kitchen floor was sticky. It was now about 9:30pm or so and again rather than complain that late at night, we were tired and wanted to get ready for bed, so decided to stay, but would talk to the front desk in the morning. The main bedroom corner wall where my husband slept that night was wet and smelled moldy. Thursday morning when we were leaving the hotel, we talked to the front desk about the room, that we were not happy, it was dirty, a smoking room, smelled moldy in the bedroom and would rather move back to 703 if they could get the heat fixed. We told them we were going to be out for the day and would check with them when we came back to see if room 703 heat was fixed. When we got back and stopped at the front desk, they said the heat was fixed and gave us new keys to move back to 703. So again, we went up to 803, packed up all our things and moved back to 703. When we got to the room the fan was running so we assumed the heat was working. Unpacked our things and went out for supper. Again upon returning around 7:30pm, I said the room doesn\u2019t feel very warm. We looked at the thermostat and it hadn\u2019t warmed up past the 65 it was on when we moved back to the room earlier. At this point we are getting quite annoyed. If they said the heat was fixed, they should have at least made sure it was working. We called the front desk and they again said they would move us to another room. They moved us to room 603. This also was a smoking room and smelled awful of smoke. The kitchen floor was definitely dirty and sticky. When you walked on it you shoes stuck each step you took. Called the front desk about the smell and they said they would send up someone to spray the room for the smell. When I went to take a shower we did not have hot water, it was barely lukewarm. At this point it is close to 9:00pm, so we decided to wait till morning to call the front desk, it was getting late and we did not want to have to sit and wait for someone to come and check the water. SO IN A LITTLE OVER 24 HOURS WE HAD MOVED FOUR TIMES AND STILL DID NOT HAVE AN ACCEPTABLE ROOM FOR WHAT WE WERE PAYING \u2013 NOT WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN A RELAXING GETAWAY. AND AS MENTIONED ABOVE TWO OF THE ROOMS WERE NOT CLEAN. Friday when we went out we left a note for the kitchen floor to be washed and they did do that. They checked the water and said there was nothing wrong with it, but it was never hot. On Saturday two of our granddaughters came down to stay overnight with us. When we woke Sunday morning to leave, the younger girl had ants in her bed. Now we are on the 6th floor, where did the ants come from? When we were checking out, we talked to the manager about our stay and asked for some kind of discount for all the inconveniences we had. He was very condescending and actually inferred that we we lying about the ants, even though our Daughter-in-Law brought the sheet down with the ants in it. His comment was ants don\u2019t go on beds. He said this not only once, but twice. I asked him what he was saying, that we were lying and at that point he never answered me, so I can only assume that is exactly what he was saying, that we were lying. His comment to us on checking out is, that they took care of each item we complained about. My comments are that we had to put up with way too many inconveniences for the money we were paying. Again we asked for some kind of discount and he said no, that we had been upgraded already. But, that was the hotels choice, we never asked for an upgrade, we would have been happier in our original requested room, non-smoking, ocean front.", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value...great stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4070854", "Content": "The 2BR Oceanfront was worth every penny + more!

My suite was clean, although the furniture, etc. is in serious need of replacement. Of course, this is a very heavily used resort and let's be realistic - it is the end of the season. Hopefully - they will do some repairs and remodeling during the winter. I do think the prices are a bit high for the quality of the surroundings. I also was very disappointed to find out that high-speed internet access was no longer available in all suites (as it has been when I stayed in the past). There was no indication of this until I tried to connect. I then found out they have changed to wireless and it is not available in oceanfront suites - only in poolside suites, in the atrium and the front lobby - cost of $9.95 per day. I left a day early because I needed to connect for business reasons and going to the atrium was no always convenient for me and the weather was not all that great.

She said the price we paid for the room, $249, was already a discount, and would do nothing for us. The furniture is so disgusting I don't even want to sit on it. The staff members I spoke to were lovely, but unfortunately, they are stressed because they have to go through Atilla the Hun. Don't let the gorgeous lobby fool you.

The halls were never really cold like a hotel should be. It smelled musty and dank. Food that was delivered to the rooms, and finished were left in a pile for hours by the candy machines smelling up the whole hallway. The room was full of cigar smoke when we arrived and had to be aired out for hours. The sight of towels hanging of the terraces reminded me of the old country, very tacky. The air conditioning was noisey and very hard to regulate and at time made the room smell worse. The Atrium was nice except for the evening hours when the mice would run by the rooms. You would always know when that happens because you would hear screaming and the rustling of the metal chairs scattering. that to me was the worst the hotel had to offer and could possibly be the cause of disease, especially to all the kids walking bare footed.

Also, they say this is a newly renovated hotel...but then why does all the furniture and decorations look like they are from the 70s? Another complaint that i have about the room is that the balcony only holds one person, it was so tiny. If you need to use the internet then you have to go down to the pool area. They say that all the rooms have access, but only some of the rooms do and it cost $10 a day. As you probably have read from other reviews the elevators take so long. When I first read that before going to the hotel I just thought people were being picky but I didnt realize they had chairs located by the elevators for your long wait. Once you get on the elevator you are overcome by an annoying voice telling you how great the hotel is and of course who could forget about their annoying and cheesy theme song. Oh by the way...I wouldnt trust the glass elevator in my own oppion, it looked very old and delapitadated. If you decided to go out at night then make sure you come back to the hotel early because there isnt enough parking. It took me a half hour to find a parking space. If you are planing to go during the summer months please keep in mind...that the boardwalk and other attractions are not minutes away like they advertise..in fact 1hour! This hotel is diffently not a resort by any means. They have pool..correct. Although it seemed small for the amount of people, cold, and dirty. Didnt use the sauna in fear of catching a disease. The hot tubs were always taken and Full of sand. As for the other attractions such as the minture golf course dont even waste your time going all the way up to the roof because its pretty much destroyed and vacant. This also includes the tennis courts and the video games are usually out of order. The \"Cafe on the green\" highly priced..but i guess that is to be expected with any hotel. The green well thats grass and mud with plastic lawn chairs on them. They did have a person singing though that was pretty nice. Although the same person came back the next day singing the same old songs. When you leave for check out make sure you look at your bill closely because i got charged with someone's $48 lunch...although after i got home i called and they took care of the whole ordeal. I didnt even want to go the the buffet because the byt the time i got there i was sick from the smelly hallway and deicded to eat outside of the hotel.

We had clearly requested a non smoking room and were not only put in a smoking room, but our whole floor was smoking rooms. When my mom called the front desk trying to switch out, explaining how sensitive we all are to smoke, they told my mom there were no rooms available and the hotel was completely booked. The next morning we noticed that the room right beside us was non smoking and that no one was staying in it. My mom called the front desk and told them that we were switching. The man told my mom that we couldn't because the family that was checking in that afternoon had clearly requested a non smoking room, even though he had told us they didn't honour requests. The staff at the princess royale were so rude we couldn't believe it. The manager, Ruby, refused to talk to my mom, lied to her, and even walked away from the desk and into her office. Once, while my family was eating lunch, a man that worked at the pool came to our table and started yelling at my dad because he took pool towels. He even called him a liar! The trip wasnt everthing that we had planned but we were trying to make the best out of it, which was really hard with all the un welcoming staff. I've stayed at tons of hotels and never had I seen this..there was not ONE helpful staff, they didn't care at all. Aside from all of that, the beach was beautiful! That was what kept us from leaving. I suggest you buy cheap beach towels and chairs though. We rented about 5 towels, 2 umbrellas and 5 chairs a day, which costed 60$! It was a shame because the guys from the rental take everything away at 5, which is usually our favourite time of the day. The city is extremely busy and not the classiest. We couldn't find many places to dine in the evenings except for 2 great places. I recommend Fresco's and the Tokyo Steakhouse, unless you like all you can eat buffets.

My husband had trouble with his room key and was sent back 3 times, each time told that it would work. Eventually he had to wake me up to let him in and I happened to not be feeling well, so this was a BIG imposition. The large indoor pool inside the atrium was nice and my son and his friend enjoyed it, but they had a hard time elbowing their way into several of the other poolside games that were available to guests. Some of the guests could have used etiquette lessons. There was a showerhead conveniently placed at the entrance of the pool area, presumably so beach bathers could de-sand themselves without contaminating the pool area. Unfortunately, many of the guests appeared to be in need of remediation for this rather mundane task, as there was wet sand streaked way into the pool area. If you wanted to avoid the sand, you'd have to be sure you kept your sandals on, even around the pool! The pool area could have been better maintained, too. We arrived at the end of the day and had to remove used wet towels left behind by lazy pool swimmers, and drinks with cigarette butts floating in them, too. The towels provided by the pool staff were near sandpaper quality, which explains why so many who stay here bring their own. Speaking of towels, many of the guests hung their own wet towels on the railings of their very tiny balconies, making the atrium a real eye-sore. In spite of a sticker on the sliding glass door that led to each balcony clearly asking all hotel guests to refrain from such practice, this was not enforced, so the result was a slum-like setting. Yuck! The balconies were just slivers of real-estate. Enough for two resin chairs and one small round resin table. Not enough for humans to sit in them, so the balcony never got used. Lousy view of other peoples' towels, anyway. The hotel hallways were NOT air-conditioned which made it feel like a sauna every time you got off of the elevator. This may not seem like a big deal, but the heat was oppressive. There was a lot of self-promotion throughout the hotel, too. The elevators even had a small screen advertising the hotel restaurant's happy hour, etc. The rooms: Although the bedroom was big, we could have done with a much larger TV screen. We had a king-size mattress which was great, but it wasn't very comfortable. Even worse was the pull-out sofa that my son and his friend shared. It really could have used a much better quality mattress. Housekeeping could make more of an effort to clean around the beds, too. When my husband moved the bed a tad to plug in our phone charger, we discovered discarded Trojan wrappers, hair clips, etc. from previous guests. The bathrooms were adequate, although my husband had to tweak the showerhead to get the water to come out in a full stream. Originally, we were getting just the tiniest trickle. The towels were not very plush but were restocked by housekeeping, which is the least you should expect. There was also what I believe was supposed to be a laundry line in our bathroom -- a clothing line that was supposed to stretch across from one side of the tub to the other and actually clip on to the opposite side. A great idea for drying wet bathing suits, if only ours hadn't been a foot too short for the task. It was really very funny, but totally in keeping with how shoddy the rest of the hotel appeared to be. There is a safe in each room and you get charged .99/day whether you use it or not, which I though was laughable. The suite's air conditioning condenser unit was in the bedroom, very close to the bed. It was extremely noisy and took a lot of getting used to in order to fall asleep. According to one other guest we spoke to, this hotel is supposed to be among the nicest, but that's not saying much since many of them seemed rather seedy. The next time we vacation in this area, we'll stay farther north away from the commercial strip. That was probably our mistake. Condominiums, hotels, etc. farther north with beaches just as beautiful seemed much more tasteful and to our liking. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone accustomed to luxury. This hotel charged MUCH more than Embassy Suites and couldn't begin to compete with it.

However, it seems that the hotels closer to the boardwalk are more run down and geared toward singles and not family.", "Date": "July 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA true resort in old town Ocean City, MD\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3623256", "Content": "Where do I start? My wife, Louisa, and I just returned from a 5 day/4 night stay at the Princess Royale and we were delighted. The room, hotel and beach are all Excellent. We arrived June 22, 2005, 2:30pm but couldnt check-in early since our room was not ready. We returned at 4:05pm and we were greeted with a prompt check in. Our vehicle was parked in the garage by courteous valet personnel and also had our bags brought to our room by the bellhop. I usually tip a few dollars (here-and-there) on all vacation as we have learned, service seems to be better. We did tip at the Royale, although not necessary but appreciated when we did. Room: All rooms are Suites. Did you hear me? All Suites... Not a box room like other comparable hotels. We requested a King size bed and non smoking (top floor); both were granted. The room was HUGE, with balcony overlooking swimming pool. It had two TV's, Iron w/ bd, Full kitchen & Livingroom and a very nice shower. I am actually in the process of replacing our showing head at our home after using the Royals. The OxyGenics shower is really relaxing and saves water. The hot water during dinner time doesnt last forever, but is sufficient. Room: A+ Pool: Really nice but crowded with plenty of kids. It is Olympic size with 3 Jacuzzi (1 inside, 2 outside) and 2-Suana's (one didnt work that well). But over all nice atmosphere. The pool area also has pool tables, ping pong table and video games. This is the area when you will defiantly realize it is a Family Resort. Do note: There is no life guard on duty and I personally feel that hotel should double think this as there is alot action happening. Pool: B Restaurant: There are 2-4 restaurants located on the premises but not all open until July 1, so we were not able to experience all. Schooner Restaurant though is very nice. The food is GOOD and the portions are even BETTER. Most workers were International and very respectful. The service was prompt. We ate there for Brunch and had a late drink. It did seem late light, Mgrment could not be found and workers waiting to serve. The bar had cold drinks and great service. There is also a grill on the Beach, but I'll get to that later. Restaurant: A Personnel: Respective and Courteous. From waiter(s), bellhop, valet guys and even house cleaning. One day we ran back to our room a few minutes after the room was cleaned and a housekeeper, asked if there was anything she can do to make it better or something she missed to simply let her know. Impressive! The Valet guys are really kool. I actually have a $1000+ stereo in my car and forgot my cell phone + digital camera a few times and nothing got stolen. Trustworthy. Personnel: A+ Beach: Nice. The past few years we have gone to Outer Banks, Jamaica and Mexico but wanted to give old O.C. a whirl. The beach was a tad crowded as I think we caught the tail end of senior week, but the youngsters were fine. Everyone is simply working on his or her tan. They had beach volleyball activity. There is also Beach chairs and umbrellas for rent per day, but we had our own so we didnt get. There is Live entertainment (one man band) everyday. We didnt catch his name, but does cover songs. He plays for a few hrs in the afternoon and is a delight to hear while basking in the sun! There are two \"Huts\" set up one-minute off the beach. Food, Drinks and Ice cream stocked. Very nice addition. Beach Atmosphere: A Other things to note: Roof top mini golf available, but the course is ancient. No biggy. Fun to do! Overall our experience was really Great. Sometimes we get away for a day or two at the Castle and the Stand, but we think those days are over. Short or Long get-aways will now be spent at the Princess Royale. I highly recommend this hotel as long as you dont mind kids. Ohhh I forgot, I got the best deal. It was actually a lot cheaper than booking directly with the Hotel. You ask, where can you find this better price? \"If I told ya, I may hafta kill ya\". Joking. Go hither at the Royale, it will be a Blast!

Also, the front desk/reception area staff was extremely accommodating and helpful, especially Karolina. She was extremely professional and cordial in handling any questions that we had with regard to our stay at the resort.

We checked in and went up to our room only to find that the key card didn\u2019t work. While standing outside the door, I heard noises coming from inside so I decided to check back at the front desk. The women behind the counter called the room and somebody answered. Apparently the room had been given to somebody else. We were then assigned another room. When we get up to the room, we find that it is not the correct type of room. I had reserved a side ocean view and was given a pool view. (Note: If you\u2019re dumb enough to stay at this place after reading this review and you plan on sitting on your balcony with some peace and quiet, don\u2019t get a pool view room.) I again go down to the front desk and after 20 minutes am told that there are no more rooms available for which my reservation was made. (Unbelievably, during this wait, a woman behind me was turned away with a reservation due to the overbooking.) I was told to come back the next morning to speak to the room supervisor (Joy) for a reduction in my rate. At this time, I also pointed out an error that was made on my check-in sheet that stated I was staying 3 nights. In fact, my reservation was for 2 nights and I had a confirmation to prove it. The woman crossed out the error by hand and said everything would be alright. It took over an hour before we were even checked in and settled in our room. The next morning, I find Joy and I\u2019m told that the pool view rooms are the same rate as the side ocean view so there is no rate reduction. Not a big deal, I\u2019m not out trying to scam anybody. I just basically wanted what I reserved. We get moved to a side ocean view room. On the final day, I check out and the counter person (Karolina) tells me that I will have to pay for the 3rd night, even though I didn\u2019t reserve it. This wouldn\u2019t have been so bad were it not for her smug attitude. The employees at this place are just salivating to invoke the no refund for early departure clause that is prominently displayed in various places. I\u2019m then asked to step aside and wait yet again for another manager who couldn\u2019t be located. I refuse to step aside and the error is eventually corrected by another employee who was a little nicer. Long story short, the service is horrible at this place. They will look to rip you off if possible. Also, the other reviews about the elevators (slow), pool (not close to olympic size) and smells in the room (moldy) are correct. Add to this the fire alarm at 8:30 am on Saturday morning and the noisy air conditioning units, and you can see why you should look to stay somewhere else. Believe it or not, they handed me a coupon for a future stay when I left.

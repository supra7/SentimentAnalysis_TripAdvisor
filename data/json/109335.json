There is some very good, and some bad with this hotel - the saying that you get what you pay for really rings true here. This Staybridge is relatively cheap as compared to other hotels in this area because it is an older Staybridge, on the fringe of a neighborhood that seems to be not very safe - based on the police I saw coming into the manager's office and asking \"how things have been here.\" The decor is fine but seems very 80s. I laugh at the title of \"near the Galleria\" - it is actually about 3 miles drive from the mall. One thing that really made me think negatively of the hotel is that you have to go up a small flight of stairs to get to the elevator - unbelievable for any hotel of it's kind. You can avoid the flight (about 5 steps), but you have go all the way around the property - it made me think that handicapped persons or those who need extra assistance to get to their rooms could have a problem here. Also, there were several very annoying and antogonizing stray cats around one of the side entrances - that wanted to come into the hotel and also jump into your car if you left the door open! I stayed on the top floor as usual, but noted a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the hall, but not in the room. What made the stay positive was the very helpful front desk staff, who really deserve a gold star for their friendliness and helpfulness, not the least of which included not charging me for a multiple page, long distance fax I needed to send.

The room itself provides you with anything you could ever need from a toaster, dishwasher, dishwashing liquid, stove, pots and pans, cooking utensils, silverware, a full size fridge, not one of those mini-fridges(I love ice cream, and mini-fridges fail at keeping your ice cream frozen).

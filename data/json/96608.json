The dry cereal was stale and the waffles were toaster waffles. All the bread was frozen and the biscuits were not done in the middle. When we asked for more towels they brought them and set them on the hall floor outside our door where everyone walks. The next day they sat them outside our door in a plastic bag. None of the people (44 of us) had maid service after that first day. There was another tour bus from another tour company and some of those people had bugs in their rooms. It was so bad that a representative from our tour company had to come. Our last day there they did have jelly packets but no peanut butter packets.

It has a friendly well educated and trained staff. It is a quite Inn with two pools one indoor , and one out door. The Inn has it's charm and character of warmth and welcoming! If you read any of the bad reviews of the Inn I would say some one was not happy and made identities or have friends that will join them in the evil plight to cause some nice businesses harm! We are in an internet world of mean and deceitful people among us , you will find them driving on our roads, allowing the children run a muck, and going online to see how they may bring a business to their knees for laughs! Trolls is the term I believe, a person that the only task is to make and cause trouble to the innocence and the kind. From reading what some wrote I see the signature of this multiple identity troll! My carpets are fine being in several rooms I have not seen the carpets mentioned in the bad reviews. The flickering lights? Well I have always been sober and can not say that I have ever seen such an illusion. Off in the far distance you may see a ww1 search light hitting the clouds. But you really have to look for that. The continental breakfast? No complaints there , and about a lady jumping a child, that could be possible , parents do not educate respect of others property , yet I doubt any one jumped on a child here. And if they did the mentality of this parent probably would not have noticed the child being scolded anyway! IMO Children should be kept close by and monitored not allowing misbehavior . I was not there when it happened it is just my opinion. But the only time I seen a negative was maybe this filling that was on her cell phone too much and not watching the breakfast. But people will be people, it did not dicourage my visit! Noise? The main road is 2 blocks away, could this noise been your own? Noise is a made up companit as this Inn is a quite place to be. Over all some one that complains Of the Mountain Music Inn could not have been to the same one I frequent! 300 Schaefer in Branson is the Place I was, and it is nothing as the negitive reviews say! Even the guest are friendly and helpful to each other making it a very family oriented stay forme and my family! So stop by and visit , take light that bad people will make trouble in a town, ether for their own lonely entertainment or to make harm to ANOTHER business. Not saying another Inn hotel or motel is up to this but it has happened in other businesses. Greedy mean full people in this world as you know it are out there. This Inn is great!

With the weather trying to change at this time of year, you need a a/c during the day & heater by night. Both were great & thermostat controlled which was extremely nice! I read in another review about someone saying something about lights bouncing around the room at late hours of the night. That can be explained very easily!

When we were in the car, he said he awoke at 2 AM with pressure on his whole body, he said his hands were tingling and it felt like someone was laying on top of him. At that point, I FREAKED out, and told him that's exactly what happened to me at that time. I still can't believe how weird that whole experience was.

This is a large hotel, so it could be noisy when fully booked. Breakfast: While not as extensive as some continental breakfasts I've had, it was adequate. The person who does the breakfast keeps it very clean and well stocked. There is a large dining area, so plenty of seating. Cons: Room:Our air conditioner did not work very well and we had trouble keeping the room from getting stuffy. I suppose this could change from room to room. Fortunately, it was only in the 80's. Any hotter and we would have been miserable. Housekeeping was hit and miss. Sometimes they forgot to leave a bar of soap, other times it was glasses to drink from. I'm very good about tipping housekeeping staff, and that usually means I don't have any problems in this area. While not enough to ruin a vacation, it was a little frustrating when you wanted a drink of water after brushing your teeth and there wasn't a glass. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of information available for hotel guests about the hotel. We had to keep calling the front desk to find out what time breakfast was, Was there an exercise room (yes), and other questions that could easily be answered by posting a one page info sheet in the room. Overall, we were less than thrilled with the room. We booked it because of its high ranking on Trip Advisor (for the price). However, it has really slipped in the rankings during the last month. While the price seemed very inexpensive, there were many hotels in this price range in Branson.

The perks to the room was that we were able to check in early in the day and it was a fairly quiet room with a ton of water pressure in the shower. Downsides were (yes, there are many): The carpet was worn and stained. The furniture was in very poor condition. The beds were lumpy and the pillows were very flat. The hotel staff was less than friendly at check in and check out; we had to request information about breakfast (that we skipped), the locataion of the pools, etc) Small bug problem in the bathroom, so we kept the door shut at all times to avoid them getting in the main room. We were placed in the older section of the hotel making it a long walk to the small, cold indoor pool with 2 young children. Like a previous poster indicated (I wish I had seen that post before we made our reservation) there were some strange comings and goings at night. On our walk back from the pool at about 9:30 or 10, we noticed several cars with people just sitting in the parking lot sporadically through the lot, 1 directly in front of our room (we had no neighbors on either side) for at least 30 minutes that we knew of. Something just didn't seem right about it. We stay in Branson frequently (approx. 4 times a year) and this is the first time we have felt less than safe.

I booked it based on reviews from this website and AAA. I was very disappointed with our stay. This was our first time in Branson and I will definitely stay somewhere else if we ever go back. The motel was difficult to find and was tucked away from all the activity. We were given a room in the older part of the facility. I don't know if this based on the price we paid or what. Our room was large but very old. The carpet was worn and dirty, the pillows were saggy, small TV. We thought all the rooms had refrigerators when we booked but for $3 more a night they brought one to our room. They provided no hair dryers, irons, shampoo or lotion. We had to ask for another roll of toilet paper when ours was running low. They also advertised free wireless internet but you had to leave your building and go to the breakfast room to be able to use the internet. The continental breakfast was pretty good. We had biscuits and gravy one morning and the other two mornings they had oatmeal along with all the other standard continental food items you would expect. Apparently they rent out rooms to young foreign workers as there were numerous young Russians who showed up for breakfast and then were picked up by a van each morning. There were some strange comings and goings on during the night - such as vehicles with young people sitting in the parking lots. I was not real comfortable with the situation.

The shower was in terrible shape, with a used bar of soap from the previous guest still in the shower, and a build up of soap film on the shower wall, from what appeared to be weeks, if not months of build up from never being cleaned. The cove base was coming off of the wall in the bathroom, there was a notice asking guests to use the \"Dark Washcloth\" to remove makeup, yet there was no such cloth provided. The ceiling was peeling off above the jacuzzi, and jacuzzi was as dirty as the shower. The first time we filled it and turned it on, before we ever got into it, the bubbles being generated were coming out with a milky white film all over them. We ended up draining and refilling it several times before we used it, but it was still a very uncomfortable felling, using this obviously filthy jacuzzi. Not using it as planned, definitely made our stay an overpriced waste of time and money. The air conditioning was just as dirty as the rest of the room, making us get congested and feel ill whenever we were in the room. I took the liberty to lift the front off of the A/C unit and looked at the filter, and it was visibly filthy which has been proven to cause \"Sick Building Syndrome.\" When all of the air in a room is moved through one A/C unit with one simple filter collecting all of the dust, bacteria, virus's in the air, if the filter is never changed or cleaned, it no longer is a filter, but a dispenser of illness. The last and most deplorable thing, was that in three nights of staying there, our sheets were never changed once, even though it was very hot and the sheets were soiled, then on the third night the temperature dropped significantly, but the maid had removed the blanket from our bed that day, so we only had a sheet and a bedspread, leaving us a little chilled. The \"Icing On The Cake\" was their Continental Breakfast. The coffee wasn't even hot, the donuts were dry, the \"Crock Pot\" Oatmeal looked like it had been slow cooking all night, and the hard boiled eggs were left open and exposed to the air, as was all of the food, for all of the flies to land on, and there were lots of flies.

It is easy to get to the Music Shows, Silver Dollar City, Celebration City, multiple exhibits such as the Titanic and of course a Host of available restaurants nearby. We expecially love the Hotel section of Mountain Musin Inn because it has an elevator and inside corridors. The rooms are also a little bigger and there are two vanities, one inside the bathroom and the other outside which makes getting ready a breeze and is great for families or when going with another couple. The motel section is also nice however the rooms are a little smaller with outside corridors and only one vanity in each room. There are two swimming pools and one hot tub. The inside pool and hot tub are in the hotel section and my wife especially likes these when returning from Silver Dollar City or the Music Shows in the evening. The Pool and hot tub stay open usually between 11:00-11:30 depending on the number of guests using them. I might add that even if you are not staying in the Hotel section that the Motel part also availability to use the same facilities in the Hotel Section. The Continental Breakfast Bar is good and about par for the other places in Branson. It has a nice setting that features an open hearth fireplace and ice cream chairs and table. Kids stay free however since ours are grown we especially like their hospitality card that they punch each night you stay and after so many you are rewarded a free nights stay.

It has a good, central location in north Dallas. The main reason I have given this hotel only two stars is that it is messy. There was a persistent odor inside the hotel. The floors were dirty and the walls, floors, ceilings...just about everything is starting to show its age and is getting rough around the edges. I don't know what it is about Embassy's lately, but Hilton really needs to upgrade/repair/replace the elevators. They are slow and sometimes seem to have a mind of their own. Our room was fairly clean for the most part except for a foot long piece of toilet paper hanging from one of the fire sprinkler heads (I can't figure that one out except that maybe the housekeeper used toilet paper to clean it with and left it hanging up there in a rush). Also, there was a section of the ceiling that was missing. It was about 1' x 2' and had a green wire hanging out. It appeared that there was supposed to be a metal plate covering it. Very odd. The beds were clean, but the floor was not. But since we arrived fairly late at night, we just went to bed. The shower was very nice with alot of water pressure and plenty of heat. The afternoon managers reception was one of the weakest I've been to. Very slow and the food was of poor quality in my opinion. As a result, we decided to skip breakfast the next morning. As with most Embassy's I've been to, the service and employees were great. Always had a smile and were wanting to make our stay better.

We wanted to splurge a bit for our holiday, so wanted a place that was nice with good service. We were NOT disappointed! The hotel has just undergone a renovation in the common areas, and it was very tastefully done. The room was very comfortable, great beds, and our room was just off the atrium/lobby open area on the 7th floor...didn't hear a thing. Another reason for our choice was the location, with its proximity to some great shopping areas, and within a reasonable taxi fare zone to the night life in the Oak Lawn area. Being 12 miles away from our desired entertainment areas and based on some rather distasteful prior cabbies on various other trips, we were afraid we may get fare-robbed, but again, we were not disappointed ($20ish). There were a few very minor hiccups. We arrived on Wednesday evening, and were greeted by the wonderfully pleasant desk hostesses. After checking in, we naturally headed down to the lobby bar for the Managers Cocktail hour. The gentleman working the bar that evening (3/14 and Thursday 3/15) had a rather grouchy disposition who was put out by having to break off conversation with friends to wait on us lowly hotel guests, greeting each request with a scowl. Fortunately the servers for the remainder of our 4 night stay were very nice and polite. The other hiccup was that since it is such a large hotel, it evidently is very popular with large groups. The first two days and nights there was a big group of high schoolers there for a religious revival which was VERY loud, and also made the breakfast area a disaster area (great breakfasts by the way!!!!). Another night was invaded by a youth soccer league which turned the lobby area and elevators into a playground of uncontrolled children. But overall, this is a great property to stay at, and the few inconveniences caused by other guests (on our visit) are really overshadowed by how nice it actually is to stay there!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Byram, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay\u201d", "Author": "TravelingMomma73", "ReviewID": "UR126449761", "Content": "We visited Dalls during Spring Break and stayed at the Embassy Suites in the Park Central Area. I was a little worried based on the reviews I had read, but since I prefer Embassy over other hotel brands and the price was right on this one, I bit the bullet and made the reserverations. While I had good directions to get to the hotel, the interstate system in Dallas can be confusing. I can't hold this against Embassy since they didn't design the roads, but I wish there could have been an easier way to get there. We called around 6pm to let them know we were running a little late, and they told us they were overbooked and that it was a good thing we called. When we got there, the front desk staff were very nice and had our room keys waiting. Check-in was a breeze. The parking garage was not that scary, but difficult to nativigate as the entrance had this really steep hill and all the signs only pointed to the exit (which happened to be the entrance as well). But based on the front desk's recommendation on which elevator to take to be closer to our room, we found a spot parked and never had any problems with leaving our car there. Our room was nicely decorated--no spots on the carpet, no dirty towels or linens on the beds. Room didn't smell either. I loved the fact that the TV in the bedroom was mounted to the wall, which gave us full use of the top of the dresser. The layout was weird as the closet was right next to one of the beds. Not a big problem though. Just a little difficult to get around. Beds were comfortable as well. The breakfast was great, just as I expected it to be, as was the evening reception. Our iron didn't work, but when I called down and asked for a new one, they brought it right up. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen at an Embassy but it worked. Here are the problems I saw with our stay: (1) given the bathroom was so tiny, it would have been nice to have a towel rack. The only place to hang your towels was on the hook on the back of the door. (2) I saw a big roach in the bathroom on our first night there. However, I never saw another one the rest of our stay. (3) There were brown stains on the ceiling in 2 corners of the room by the windows. They looked liked water stains. (4) The computers in the business office were not that fast. (5) Website said there were renovations done recently, but I didn't see any.

My collegues joined me a few minutes later and we left to go outside the hotel as we felt this was not a full service bar but a free happy hour bar and \"John\" just wanted to pour free beer and wine and get his tips. He was extremely rude!! The door to my room was scuffed up with a bunch of black marks - my room was ok until i looked in the bathroom.

I also like the fact that the experience is consistent, which is a plus on business travel. (Give me unique and quirky on my personal trips, but predictable on business ones!) I have rarely had bad experiences in Embassy Suites. Staff always seem kind, well trained and dedicated. So to experience an Embassy Suites like this one was such a disappointment. The ironic part is that I was actually expecting the polar opposite, given that they tout the fact that they just spent millions renovating the place. I shudder to think what a dump it must have been before...and I wonder where those millions went: 1) The fitness room was pathetic, with a handful of cardio machines, of which two were out of order the length of my stay. 2) The lobby frankly just smelled terrible. Being an ex-smoker, my sense of smell is somewhat debilitated, so the fact that even I could notice it means it must have been pretty bad. My colleague - who probably wished he had smoked to spare him from the stench - described it this way: \"It's like a wet cat had a party in here, then died.\" 3) While the staff were quite friendly, they did seem to have a lot of coverage issues. At one point I called down for a wake-up call. No one answered at the front desk, even after repeated tries. The FRONT DESK. C'mon, really? I finally called the restaurant and asked if they knew how I could find someone. The person offered to take note of my requested wake-up time and send it to the front desk. Do I even need to point out the call never happened? 4) In the restaurant, a colleague and I waited over 1/2 hour just for some apps.

When I can I try to stay at them. So I was excited when I found that this hotel was close to my client. I booked it and looked forward to a typical nice stay at yet another Embassy Suites. I have to admit I was disappointed. I stayed at this hotel 6 times in the past year hoping it would improve. It didn't. I cannot give this hotel a solid recommendation - look around the area for another hotel. The good news is that most of my complaints are fixable and hopefully the hotel will see to them. Pros: It's an Embassy Suites, so it has some 'pros' right off the bat. Free breakfast that is still sets the bar high for other hotel chains. The lobby is beautiful and well decorated. They have put some money into adding water-art that really gives you a calm feeling when you walk in. They have free parking (which in this area is rare). The hotel is pretty secure in that you must use your room key to use the elevator (except for the lobby level). The staff is very friendly and helpful and always enjoyable to talk with. Cons: Rooms - the beds are pretty bad. Several of the rooms I slept in had the \"dip\" in the mattress. The sofa in the room was consistently bad - i had to use pillows to give added cushion so that I wouldn't feel the sofa frame. Most of the time my room was clean, but on one occasion I found a piece of gum stuck to the headboard. It was bright green and hard (so it had been there a while) and was the first thing I saw when I walked in the room. I stayed in several rooms that had stained carpet. Bathrooms - at first I thought it was just the one room I had, but I noticed after a while that every bathroom has some kind of leak/drip coming from the ceiling. I even noticed that each bathroom had some rust on the ceiling (near the metal access panel). At least the showers were nice. Gym - This was a frustrating point for me. The main thing in a gym that I use is the bike. When I first got to the hotel I noticed it didn't work. I told the front desk and they said they'd have someone come fix it. 3 weeks went by and the bike wasn't fixed. I left Dallas for a few months and when I returned the bike still wasn't fixed. I stayed there recently (3 weeks ago) and the bike still hasn't been fixed. What's worse is that this last trip the room had to be 80 degrees with no access to the thermostat. This is one of the main reasons I gave up on this hotel. There are other hotels in the area for the same price that have working amenities. I didn't expect the bike to be fixed immediately, but I did expect it to get fixed after a few months.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cA Non-Smoker's Hell, Discourteous Service.\u201d", "Author": "skugar29", "ReviewID": "UR71830608", "Content": "My fiance and I were in Dallas for one night and decided to stay at Embassy Suites.

We've had good experiences with Embassy Suites and expected a great stay here too. Our stay had some good points and some not so good. It started on a bad note. We pulled under the overhang to unload our bags before checking in and an employee quickly met us there saying, \"We need all of you to step inside for safety because there's an incident.\" \"An incident?\" my husband asks \"Yes, I need you all to come inside!\" So, leaving the minivan right there in the front entrance (and locking it!), we scurry inside and I ask the manager at the desk, \"Uh, what is going on?\" He said that the police were just outside and there were \"guns drawn\" and the police told the Embassy Suites to keep everyone inside. Looking down the hall, we could see blue lights coming in the window and sure enough, there were several police and a shady, handcuffed character was being forced in the back of one of the police cars. Not the welcome we expected. Of course, what goes on outside the hotel is beyond the staff's control, but it IS in a seedy part of town. The hotel seemed to have some extra security. For example, you have to use your card-key to go up in the elevator. I am assuming the staircase also required this but I don't know because we didn't use the stairs. All the staff we encountered on our visit were professional and kind. The air in the lobby, in fact in all common areas, smelled a bit funky. I think it smelled like ethnic hair products, but perhaps it was just a different cleaner than I am used to. Not a bad smell, but pervasive. That was weird. Our room was okay and looked \"surface clean.\" I saw some grunge on the toilet so I took a wet washcloth and little shampoo and wiped the surfaces that we were going to touch (handles, flushers, toilet seat, doors) down and got a lot of gunk on my washcloth. The TV remote didn't work but maintenance traded it out for a good one. The TVs (one in each room) come on at top volume regardless of the last volume used. The two double beds were soft, clean, and comfortable. The fold out bed (where I slept) was clean but very bumpy with its thin mattress. When someone in another room shuts their room door (the one to the common hall area) it echoes and we heard a lot of booming from this at bedtime. But it subsided. The pool was nice but crowded on the night we were there. There were plenty of towels and the pool appeared clean (I read online that the only pools germier than hotel pools are day care pools, ewwww). There was a sizeable puddle of standing water though in a low area of the floor. We like Embassy Suites for breakfast as their custom omelets can't be beat. The omelets were yummy but some other available food wasn't so great. The vat of oatmeal was very soupy and nobody wanted it but the grits in the next vat over were excellent. The hash browns were tasty but the pancakes were awful as they were room temperature, dry, and had hard edges. They must've been frozen and overcooked in the microwave. The juice dispenser was out during our visit and we could see workers scurrying around to fix it but we didn't get juice with our breakfast. As we were leaving the breakfast area, they had just set up two big coolers with hand-lettered signs saying, \"Orange Juice.\" The coffee was decent. Overall it was a decent stay although there were some glitches.

After the bartender asked me if I would like to charge the drinks to my room, I realized that we were in the wrong place. No worries, the bartender directed us to the proper location. Two lines were formed - one for beer/wine and one for mixed cocktails. After overhearing the servers tell many people in front of us that they were only giving out one drink at a time per person, when it came to be our turn, I ordered a drink and the server made it quickly and turned to my wife, who promptly ordered the same thing. This time, the bartender rolled his eyes at her, made the drink, and set the drink down rather forcefully onto the counter. I'm not sure what the deal was with this guy - perhaps he was ending a rather long and troubling day, but to me - working in the Hospitality Industry myself - that this type of frustration should NEVER be displayed in front of a guest.

No complaints at all. The lobby is inviting and the rooms were spacious and recently remodeled. Two big flat screen TVs in the room. Very clean and quiet. Some have commented that the bathrooms are small. For a solo traveler, I had no issues and even with another person, it seems more than adequate. I suppose a family might find it on the small side but I've certainly stayed at some Hilton chains where the space between the toilet and closing the door is miniscule and this wasn't that bad. There was a lot of counter space in the bathroom and a shelf below the counter to store items. Surprisingly, there was no bathtub, just a shower stall (albeit a spacious shower stall).

YES i did get a DIRTY GLASS at the manger's reception. not just hazy dirty but \"glob of cheese\" dirty. GROSS. floors by the pool stay wet and not cleaned up. elevators the same. i think they are trying to improve.........but need more work. a \"manager type\" was cleaning up tables, etc. hire some help already. room was really nice, beds were nice. we were by the freeway, not much bad noise. yes it is basement parking, but not bad situation. wish they had outdoor pool. overall, not terrible, but the little things (cleanliness) ...........kinda make a huge difference. registration staff SUPER helpful and nice every time we had questions. eat at papasitos!

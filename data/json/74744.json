{"Reviews": [{"Content": "okay Our family of five stayed at four different hotels during our spring break trip to AZ in April, 2007. This was leg one of our journey.We booked this hotel simply as a quick, no frills, two night stay visiting relative before heading off to the Grand Canyon. This hotel shares a drivway with a KMart, which was convenient for family stuff. This hotel was a little scary to check in at 10pm but there seemed to be adequate police presence in the area. There is no elevator to the second floor, all hallways are exterior, and they don't supply cots, nor was there room for one anyhow. The room had a slightly dirty feel and it was worn (scuff marks on the walls, paint missing in a patch in the bathroom) but overall it was adequate, and cheap for a couple of nights. On the good side, it has a nice pool area and it is located nearby to many Phoenix attractions. Castles and Coasters is nearby, and the Village Restaurant (located in Kmart's parking lot.) Water pressure was good.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR765223270", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "NYJacki"}, {"Content": "Rate quote not correct and believe I was over charged Booked through Travelcity and received confirmation quote of $49.99 per night, but when we checked in the rate was $54.99 per night and I was charged 14% tax. I do not know if the tax percentage is even correct but when you don't live in that area and are checking out there isn't much you can do. this is the second time I have had this experience booking with Travelocity so maybe the problem with rate difference if something they should work on.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR370447105", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d74744-r7430118-Super_8_Motel_Phoenix_West_I_10-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "74744", "Price": "$69"}}

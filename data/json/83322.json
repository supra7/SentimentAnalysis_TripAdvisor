Good sized swimming pool and jacuzzi. Friendly staff, and a pretty good Free breakfast. Which Is a lifesaver with Teanage kids. Location wise, it's a little bit out of the way I your wanting downtown San Diego, or mission bay. But weighing up value / distance, it's well worth the trek.

Everything from the Ritz to Motel 6. I know what people look for in a hotel. My family and I were looking for clearn, affordable and safe while we visited my dad in South San Diego. We knew we would not spend time at the hotel, so we decided to not spend too much money but wanted something clean and decent. This hotel had good customer service. The lady at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was decent. That is about the extent of the positive. Now for the real problems: Our kitchenette sink was clogged when we arrived. The room smelled bad. The furniture and carpet was dingy. The manager who came into my room to unclog the sink, left a 12 inch knife ( very sharp) right on the bathroom sink area that my two year old found and handed to me!!!! This was that straw that broke the camels back and mine! I was shocked. His reaction? \"oh. I forgot the knife\" oooops! Then, I called down for a roll a way bed since the couch was so smelly and dirty for my three year old and he said, \"sure no problem\". I only found out later that he would charge me for this without informing me of the price or the fact that there was a charge in the first place. His explanation? \" this is not a cheap motel maam\" Only cheap hotels don't charge for roll a way beds. What? made no sense to me at all. When I saw the knife, I should have just grabbed my family and ran for the hills. The location stinks too! You are surrounded by industrial toxins and huge trucks in line to cross the border. It is way out of the way from anything remotely interesting....( except for Mexico) if you you happen to have your passport with you. The only reason I gave this hotel any credit at all was their nice front desk lady and the comfy bed in the room. Other than that, this hotel is AWFUL!!!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and convenient, but thin walls!\u201d", "Author": "Professional_Fan", "ReviewID": "UR109960115", "Content": "We stayed here because we were attending a show at the Cricket Wireless Amphitheater; none of my party drive and we needed a hotel close by.

The staff were really friendly, although the woman on the front desk gave us some embarrassing advice regarding a nearby restaurant: she told us it was too far to walk with our luggage (four 'long' blocks) and called us a cab; turns out it was literally around the corner and resulted in a very annoyed cab driver (who'd taken the job after his colleague didn't bother showing up at all) and us over-tipping in embarrassment. The only other complaint we had was that the walls in our room were extremely thin. We could hear people snoring in the next suite along!

Because it is located a stone's throw from the Mexican border -- away from beaches and tourist areas -- it fights hard to win your business.

We paid $83 a night over Labor Day. if you know San Diego, you know you are not going to get that kind of rate on a decent property in an area closer to downtown during a holiday weekend. The drive was well worth it, because we could get to Coronado Beach within 25 minutes or so. The hotel is located in an industrial area which includes a couple of small malls. There's at least one local Italian restaurant located nearby, but it's not exactly gourmet, so you'll probably plan on eating a bit farther away. Negatives? the breakfast room is much too small to handle a full house. Other than that, we think it's great.

It is slower than dial-up and most of the time the pages will nto even load. When we complained about this, they acknowledged it was a problem. As they are not in a cable service area, they rely on satellite for Internet, and it is not reliable at all. If you are into the heavy, fattening breakfasts, theirs is ample.

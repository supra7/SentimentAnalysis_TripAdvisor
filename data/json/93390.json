Back then it was a one star at best, but I still managed to fall in love with the location. The upper west side has so much to offer - particularly if you've been to NY before and have already done the Midtown thing. Fast forward to 2012 and the hotel has been completely renovated, in fact some of the earlier renovations are possibly due a refresh (our bathroom, while clean & well equipped, was a little tired). The hotel is still doing major works - there was a temporary reception area when we stayed and you had to go to a 'guest lounge' on the first floor to access the complimentary coffee etc. If you have stayed at the Belleclaire before the renovations started - you won't recognise it now. If you've never been there, it is about average for a hotel of this star rating/price range in NYC. The neighbourhood still ROCKS. A great market (Fairways) and Big NIck's diner (open 24 hours) are both in the same block. Great local liquor store with champagne at bargain prices around the corner. Interesting (not chain store) shopping in either direction. Easy access to Central Park, Lincoln Centre, Museums etc. Good transport options through the 1,2,3 lines.

Probably not the best reason when spending a couple of grand (for five nights), but once we arrived and checked in we were very pleased with our decision.

One 'room' had two Queen beds, and the other (the parent's room) had one Queen bed, and each had a TV. It also had a little fridge and microwave, which is good when you have kids. It was only a few blocks to watch the Thanksgiving Day Parade (and the balloon inflating thing the night before is on the same street - 77th), and there was a great pub with microbrewed beers on 76th and Amsterdam (the Amsterdam Ale House), which served a Thanksgiving dinner for us un-American tourists.

This hotel was a lovely, older style boutique hotel in a great location. Everything was well appointed and clean. That said, it was a cold, January weekend in NYC and our room and bathroom were freezing cold! The hotel had an old radiator, steam heating system, but the windows definitely need to be replaced as freezing cold air was literally blowing in from the windows in our room and bathroom, completely negating any heat offered by the room's radiator. After complaining the first night, the hotel staff sent up a space heater, which, unfortunately did little to combat the cold air drafting in through the windows. It was obvious that other guests were experiencing the same problem, based on conversations at the front desk, and the evidence of several space heaters left by maid service at the elevator areas after servicing checkout rooms. After a second complaint, the front desk sent a mainteance man up to our room. He shared that he was busy with many calls for cold rooms. He actually lowered our bedroom window and draped a blanket over it and shoved it closed and then stuffed extra towels along the base of the window. Unfortunately this did little to stop the draft whistling in from the sides of the bedroom window. We then confiscated another space heater from the hallway, and when 2 space heaters wouldn't warm our room sufficiently, we finally marched down to the lobby and registered a \"face-to-face\" complaint. The staff offered to move us to another, warmer room, and after trying several new rooms with them, we finally settled on a somewhat \"warmer\" room and moved all of our belongings (and one of our space heaters) to the new room. What a pain, although all the activity did help to warm us up! After spending the day out and about in NYC in the freezing cold temperatures, we returned to our new, warmer room to find the radiator completely cold and the room quite chilly! Fortunately, we still had the space heater, which we literally had to run constantly to remain confortable, even throughout our sleeping hours, which I wasn't real happy about. Our room radiator did actually spring to life and give off sufficient heat one time, when it awakend us with it's clangs and clunks at 6:08 a.m. Unfortunately that was the first and last time the thing gave off any heat during the remainder of our stay. Topping off all of this was the fact that I blew a circuit in our room when I turned on the hair dryer the next morning, and plunged our room into total darkness, because the space heater and hair dryer apparently caused an overload. After fumbling in the dark, I was able to locate the phone and call the front desk. They hustled a serviceman up and he reset the breaker and I was able to continue drying my hair, without the space heater running. While we were checking out, we voiced our dissatisfaction with the heating system, and were offered a meal voucher, which we turned down as we were heading out of town. During our checkout, another couple were voicing the same complaint to the other desk clerk. My advice regarding this hotel would be to book it only in mild weather months and to be sure to ask for a room with a working radiator!!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "williamsburg, va", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "jlullman", "ReviewID": "UR123736310", "Content": "We just stayed for 5 nights of theater and sightseeing!

My only negative comment was the A.C. Due to unusual hot weather while on my visit i needed to use the air con. this gave little or no relief so i reckon summer time at the hotel would not be a good idea..I Might add that we did have the system checked out while we were there and all was working... but all in all location and friendleness was brilliant and thank you Belleclaire", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kauai, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat locale, Good value\u201d", "Author": "alpsters", "ReviewID": "UR121227460", "Content": "I needed a place to stay in the city last minute that wouldn't break my wallet.

Do both the Empire State & Top of The Rock buildings. Walk the Brooklyn Bridge. Visit Times Square. People watch in Central Park - view a local softball game. Have a hotdog from a cart. Stroll 5th avenue.......the options are endless. We went to the 9/11 Memorial. Took a boat down the Hudson River, this gives a different perspective on the city & commentary is informative.

Although we've never needed their help to get around, we've seen them offer good advice to others. The fitness center is nothing special, but at least it exists: if you're a runner and the weather is not terrible, you can run in Central Park, which is much more fun.

We booked through expedia, and got a good deal. When arriving at 3am to be told our room had been subject to a minor flood our hearts sank... The reception staff were friendly and ensured we had an alternative room available, but only for one night whilst they resolved our room. The room we were given was the smallest I had ever stayed in - I mean smaller than university accommodation!! Needless to say we were both tired, and at least the bed was comfortable. The next day we went for breakfast (over the road), which was nice and we met some fellow tourists who advised on their trips so far. After then, we decided to go for a walk at Central Park, which is only 5mins away from the hotel. Upon our return to the hotel our luggage was moved and we entered our new room... To our surprise and satisfaction, the room was lovely and really big, which made up for the night before - therefore upgrade your room, plus ask for a room facing broadway. This is when our holiday really started. Admittedly some maintenance was going on on the rooms around us, but the workmen didn't start drilling or making any noise until we were up - i.e. when they heard the TV or when I went to the gym or grabbed a coffee from the foyer. I workout every day, so chose the hotel as it had a gym. Although it was small, I only ever saw one other person in there apart from my wife and I, so it doesn't feel too crammed. There are 2 treadmills, x-trainers and bikes, some free-weights (max 50lbs dumbbells), so no heaving lifting possible. The multi-gym equipment is in need of some oiling, as it was very sticky, so injuries are possible if you don't exercise properly. I would recommend the hotel purchases a bar for guests to use either on a bench or elsewhere - it does't' have to be olympic standard!! The staff were friendly, especially the doormen (as we called them). We wanted to have a special meal for our wedding anniversary, so asked the hotel for recommendations and we were surprised that the Italian they recommended provide guests of the hotel with a 30% discount. The restaurant had very friendly staff and the food was the best we ate out there. Being on 77th, unless you have your walking shoe's on, it is a good 20mins walk to Times Square, and add another 20-30mins to catch the ferry to the statue of liberty. We used a taxi once and a bus once for the experience and to save our feet from throbbing too much... Do not pay for the \"super shuttle\" - taxi transfers between JFK and the hotel are the same price, so to save you waiting for the minibus, being crammed in and potentially being the last to be dropped off...I would sort out transfers upon arrival. There are loads of taxi's outside! At the rate paid, upgraded-room stayed in, I would be happy to stay at the hotel again.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cStaying here was the low point in our vacation!\u201d", "Author": "daninicm", "ReviewID": "UR119235834", "Content": "Because of all the good reviews I thought that staying at the Belleclaire was a safe bet, I was very wrong. I will start with the few positive things that this hotel has going for it. First the location. This is the main reason why I picked the Belleclaire. The Upper West Side is a great place to stay in NYC if you are looking for a more neighborhood feel away from the hustle and bustle. Also the Belleclaire is clean. Now for the negative. Upon arrival we requested an early check in as we had an early flight and would love to have taken a nap. We expressed that we certainly understood if they could not accommodate this but would appreciate it if they could put in a request. The woman at the front desk told us she would definitely put in the request. After venturing out for a few hours we called the hotel to see if they were able to check us in early. We spoke to the same woman who checked us in. Not only did she not even remember speaking to us she never even put in the request. We booked a deluxe queen room and the size of the room was decent. I don't expect much when it comes to the size of the room in NYC. You pretty much have to expect it to be small. But the room was certainly functional and clean. Those were the only good things about this room. The hallways are so narrow and the walls are so thin that we could hear the people speaking and yelling ACROSS the hall not to mention the baby who was crying all day and night in the room next to us. The hotel did not inform us that there was construction going on in the hotel. We woke up to hammering and pounding everyday at 8am. Our bed was like a rock. Actually a rock is probably more comfortable. The pillows were even worse. They have really let this hotel become run down. All of our furniture was severely damaged and there were large holes in all the sheets, pillow cases and duvet cover. Luckily we only needed to use the air conditioner one night during our trip. After turning it on we soon found out there was no hope in sleeping with it on. It was the loudest air conditioner I have ever experienced. So we had no choice but to turn it off. We thought we would finally get some relief from the noise. We were wrong. It continued to rattle even when it was turned off and unplugged! How is it possible that an air conditioner can continue to be noisy when it is unplugged! This was officially the hotel from hell. The hotel advertises free wifi but it rarely if ever works. We had a total of 12 tv channels. No I did not come to NYC to watch television but if I am paying $2000+ for a room I should have that option. We truly felt as if we were staying in a low budget motel. The only thing that reminded us that it wasn't was how much it cost. If at any point during your trip you would like to sleep or feel comfortable I recommend not staying at the hotel Belleclaire.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northport, New York", "Title": "\u201cCharming and great location!\u201d", "Author": "Perez303", "ReviewID": "UR119221470", "Content": "Our experience was wonderful at the Belleclaire.

Me and my partner stayed at Hotel Belleclaire for 8 nights in July 2010. This place was fantastic! We arrived in New York at 12am but as with most places, this hotel is open 24 hours so check in was no problem. We were greeted with a smile and a New York hello by the doormen and given the keys to our room. Our room was pretty small, just a queen bed, a small fridge, a large tv, a desk and an aircon. We opted for the shared bathroom and we had no problem with this as it saved us money and we never once ran into the other group of people using our bathroom. The room was, although small, perfect for us because when you're in NY who spends their time in the hotel room? We used it for sleeping at that was it! We travelled to NY during the heat wave and boy did we need that aircon! It worked perfectly and actually got to 15 degree Celsius unlke many aircons in australia. The elevators were a bit slow but that can be expected from such an old building. The only fault I can give is that on one occasion my partner was seriously ill and she required doctor attention. After running down to ask the manager I was greeted with a response as though he didnt take us seriously or was thinking 'typical tourist', Nonetheless, he gave me some information about how expensive a doctor would be but he seemed like he wasnt concerned to help. The location of the hotel is perfect! It used to be right across the road from the Manhattan Diner, which we must say is the most amazing diner we ate at. Everythnig was tasty and the service was outstanding. The first few days we walked to time square from the Hotel and it takes about 20 minutes for us, taking in the sites along the way. However, the 1 train goes straight to time square and takes 5 minutes. This elaves from 79th street, 2 blocks north. If your looking to travel in a different direction, the interchange is at 72nd street and this provides various different options of trains.

We booked the 'deluxe queen room'. I will try here to give a very unbiased review so, I will go over the positive and the negative of this experience: 1. There was nothing deluxe about the deluxe queen room. The room was extremely small and very dark (picture is taken in the middle of a sunny day). The room had a very bad smell to it so we went over everything to see where is it coming from. This allowed us to see that the mattress and linens were all clean and mattress was actually new. We located the smell to be coming from the air conditioner, turned it off and reported it to the front desk. Air conditioner was a window air conditioner supported in its place by some kind of foam. Front desk staff was really very responsive and sent an engineer to look at it immediately. We had to leave the room so we did not know that fixing it did not work until the evening. We were exhausted after a busy day in New York so, instead inquiring for another room we decided to just turn the air conditioner off and open the window. The window was extremely dirty with sticky tape all over it ?? (see photo). 2. Bathroom was clean except for the tiles that could use some cleaning (see photo). There was no shower curtain and instead only a liner was placed. Toiletries were excellent. 3. There is no coffee maker in the room. 4. There is a big screen TV 5. There is a mini refrigerator 6. Only one elevator (of the two existing) worked resulting in long waiting periods 7. There is a business center in the lobby with two computers and free coffee/tea. Prints to the front desk 8. Cold water in the lobby 9. Staff is extremely nice and helpful 10. Location is excellent within two blocks from metro, numerous restaurants and grocery stores around it I travel extensively and I never stayed in a room that was called deluxe and was so inadequate. That room and the state it was on was in sharp contrast to the rest of the hotel, the lobby, the staff etc. I don't think this is new or recent as I have seen other people review about the very dirty windows. It should not take much to correct these things and it really ruins the impression of the hotel completely. The price that we paid was inadequate for what we received (I never stayed in a smelly room with sticky tape over the windows even in a much lower rated hotels).", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Kittykat0", "ReviewID": "UR117263450", "Content": "We stayed here last August it was our second time to New york on the same trip, stayed in the Sheraton the first time.

It has so much charm and the staff are very friendly and accomodating. This hotel is in an older building which adds to the charm for me but you do have to realize that means not every room is the same. Be sure to ask about the different types and sizes of rooms before you book. The value is excellent when you can find a deluxe king room in the heart of the city for under $200 per night. We love the laid back less crowded vibe of the Upper West Side neighborhood. There are lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance and of course you are right between two excellent parks with Riverside Park 2 blocks one direction and beautiful Central Park just 3 blocks away the other direction and the subway is only 2 blocks away. Yes, it is true that the elevators are cramped, not the fastest, and often at least one is under repair. However, I can live with that in exchange for the charm, location, service, and incredibly comfortable beds. I sleep so much better there than at home!! I personally love the noise and bustle of the city so I love the rooms with a view to Broadway where I can open my windows and drink in all the hustle and bustle of the city. We stayed in Room 206 this year which was AWESOME. It was a huge deluxe king room with 4 large windows facing the street. Had a nice sized closet and chest of drawers. The water pressure in the shower was fantastic. The maid service was reliable and they were very friendly. If you prefer more piece and quiet, choose a room not facing busy Broadway avenue.

I had 3 major issues with hotel: 1) Concierge tried to rip me off on setting up ride to JFK - he insisted i pay $75 (cause its dependable, and so forth) - nope Im from city so im not going to be gaffled easily....I ended up taking cab (no toll) for $50.....Beware of getting hustled by this guy. 2) only one elevator worked and its been like that from reviews for months - seems hotel too cheap to fix it. This is A big problem -don't overlook this - cause hotel is crowded and you end up waiting in lines for an elevator!!!! 3) Front desk people seemed to be too busy to answer question or annoyed if you asked them ... Bad management to let this type of impoliteness to exist....people who stay at this hotel are not from NYC - how hard is this to figure out for staff !!! I asked a good restaurant and they couldn't tell me , I asked subway ticket question and I got \"it depends\" qualifying answer (meaning I could care less go figure it out yourself attitude).... I will not stay here again and unless they retrain their staff and fix the elevator I do not recommend anyone staying here--here is my summary: First time ever in NYC and the location of this hotel is best thing going for it. \u00c2\u00a0As most negative reviews said - bummer only one small elevator works here - pretty ridiculous ...fits only bout 4 people at a time. \u00c2\u00a0Rooms are nice and comfortable - no shared bathrooms - not sure why that rumor started - air-condition nice even from small window unit - it was 100 degrees outside yet cool inside room all the time. \u00c2\u00a0 Subway is 2 blocks away - nicks diner right downstairs and great breakfast and lunch food - slice of pizza is the best - new York pizza is awesome! Museum of natural history is 4 blocks away and a good thing to do in day (air condition throughout). \u00c2\u00a0 Subway is pretty tough to navigate with many many different lines/colors, plus there's construction so some lines not working???? Went to see ground zero, wall street, empire state bldg, all via subway - you should get $10 unlimited pass. \u00c2\u00a0 Times Square by far the most impressive thing to experience in New York - like a gigantic party 24 hours a day - incredible energy and pandemonium in the air there!!!!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Castle, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cDepends on the room\u201d", "Author": "gottakeepgoing", "ReviewID": "UR115779172", "Content": "Have stayed here twice now.

The only weird part was you had to wash your hands once back in your room..so you had to touch all the door handles to get back to your room. Germ central. The room was very modern and nicely decorated though. Great food in the area...one of my favorite burger joints..Big Nicks is located just downstairs on broadway. They have the most signs you will ever see in a restaurant in your life. Its almost funny. If you can, sit on the patio, the inside is full of history but very crowded. They have super big portions and AMAZING AMAZING FOOD. The washroom in big nicks is scary. Be prepared. Its back where the dishwasher is. No matter, I frequent here when I am in the city. For around $12...and you can customize anything. From diet to meatless meat to glueten free they have it all.. Another two great things in the area..Zabars. Go here for Cheese, Fish, Bread...just walk around and take it all in. This is a city staple and everything in here is wonderful. H&H Bagels is also here...one of the oldest bagel shops in nyc. You can buy a bagel to eat, but the cream cheese is sold seperate and is not homeade..and they don't toast anything. The hotel is located on the Upper West Side. There are many great boutiques in the area, starbucks.. central park is a 10 minute walk..if you walk across to amsterdam there are lots of greats bars..shake shack is nearby..and its an overall great area...right on the subway line.

My room was a small double, indeed clean and with a very comfy bed, and the plus side of no nasty carpet, but so so tiny. Not even a small desk, a part from the bedside table. I had to place everything on the small fridge, located on the floor. I didn't think the fridge location was really hygienic, however I must say the inside was clean and shiny. No storage space at all: the so call wardorbe was too tiny to fit my luggage into, and the few hangers were not enough for my clothes. the upper shelf was filled with covers so I could not place anything on it, therefore I had to leave all my clothes on the open luggage on the floor, totally feeling like a temporary passenger, not feeling at home or even close to it. The bathroom was very clean even if basic, and fresh towels were provided for me even if I went out quite late in the morning. The worst thing ever was the view from the window: a brick wall. Next to it, another brick wall. If I really really stretched my neck, I could see a 10x10 cm of sky, very high above the building. It felt like a prison. Plus I didn't want to leave the window open, since it was very dusty and dirty with pigeons feathers on the outside. On the good side, the staff was really friendly and the location is unbeatable, and there are lots of nice places to eat around. however, since I wanted to chill out after a buzzing day in the city, this did not work at all.

Standing in an elevator with five other people, along with our luggage, the elevator (the only one out of the two which was working) got stuck between the 6th and 7th floors. When we got off of the elevator, the staff was unhelpful. They gently informed us that this was the risk we ran by getting onto such an old elevator, and that this is not an unusual occurrence. From there on out, we rode the staff elevator which is in the midst of renovation (along with the rest of the hotel). Our understanding is that the hotel has been under renovation for a long time, and it doesn't seem to be ending soon. On a positive note, our room was beautiful. Although completely lacking in storage space, we appreciated the modern style and fixtures. We would definitely return to this hotel on the basis of the room, as well as on the basis of location. Besides for the unprofessional response to, and potentially dangerous condition of the elevator, the service on a whole was sub-par. The bellhop was unable to direct us on where to park, and was uninformed as to the parking regulations of the street on which the hotel is situated. The front desk directed us to a parking garage across the street which offers discounts to those staying in the hotel. Unfortunately, there were three garages across the street. When we contacted the front desk to inquire as to which parking garage was the correct one, we were strongly encouraged to use the valet parking instead. The front desk ignored our repeated requests regarding the parking garage. What it comes down to is that we loved the room. It was beautiful, comfortable and the location was ideal. However, I don't know that we'd stay at the Hotel Belleclaire again.

Last week we decided to make another trip to the Big Apple and chose the same hotel. During these 4 years that have passed since our previous visit, it has improved very much. Service is even better than before. Every morning they serve complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby. Even by European standards, the coffee is quite tasty and with a good strength. There is free complimentary wifi. However, this is one of the few things that are not perfect. The capacity of the network provided by Wanderport is very limited. In particular in the mornings it is more or less impossible to log on to the network due to too many subscribers on the network. Otherwise, it works fine. The hotel also has a business center where one can borrow a computer and printer for 5 dollars for 20 minute session and e g checkin on flights on the internet and print out boarding passes. There is no restaurant or breakfast served in the hotel, but across the street there is a quite good diner. For those who prefer to make their own breakfast in their rooms (since they are equipped with fridges) there is a food market just around the corner from the hotel. When we visited the hotel last week, one of the elevators were broken (out of total three elevators) so there was sometimes some waiting to get access to the elvators, but that is just minor temporary problems. All in all we can highly recommend this hotel. It has a great location, very close to the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum and just a few subway stops from Times Square.

Some nearby supermarkets and food establishments were also open 24 hours. The hotel was a close walk to Central Park (Strawberry Fields) and the American Museum of Natural History. The nearest subway was two blocks away and taxis were available non-stop at every hour. As well, there were multiple well-known car rental depots right across the street, if you needed to rent a car. As for the hotel, I do have positive and negative comments to make. I stayed in room 605 (deluxe double) with a view of Broadway. First of all, I definitely recommend reserving a room with a view. The window was huge and you were able to open the window to enjoy fresh air and the nice view. On the other hand, the curtains were nonfunctional. Yes, it blocked the room from the sun in the morning, but it was hard to open and close the curtains. The room had an AC, but I never used it. The room also had a radiator, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to change the setting or anything. However, another downside of the room was sporadically throughout the night, I heard either the radiator or pipe or ventilation noises. The noise came on and off, but for short periods of time. Room 605 also had: two double beds, a mini fridge, an in room safe (pay per use), a small closet, a flat screen TV, a floor length mirror, an iPod speaker/alarm clock, a small round table with two chairs, and a small washroom. The beds and pillows were very comfy and cozy. The mini fridge was great because I had a place to store leftovers or fresh snacks from the market close by. The channels on the TV provided plenty of options. The closet was small, but it stored two pieces of luggage, while a third one was placed outside of the closet. The iPod speaker/alarm clock was also great, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a charging dock. The WIFI Internet was also good, but at times slow. In general, the room was clean and relaxing. As for the washroom, it was very small, with limited counter space, but it got the job done. It was clean and the shower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water pressure wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad. They also offered toiletries, which my travel companion said was acceptable. Lastly, the walls were thick enough for you to not hear your neighbors. As for their services, they had luggage storage if you checked in early, but check-in began at 3pm. I arrived at 8 am on March 3 and was told to come back around 1pm or they would call me when my room was ready. However, once I came back at 1, my room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready. So, I stayed in the lobby to rest. I checked in around 3pm, which was okay, but exhausting after traveling to NYC in an early morning flight. Regardless, the guy at reception was friendly and he did as best as he can to check when my room was ready. As well, one particular bellhop was really friendly and worked as best as he can to get tips. Too bad I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get his name, but he worked there in the early mornings or throughout the day. A last downside was the one small and slow elevator they had for guests. No more than four people were in there at a time. There was another elevator, but it was still being repaired. Overall, my interaction with the various employees at this hotel was delightful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a more relax area than a typical touristy area in Manhattan.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHotel Belleclaire works for us.\u201d", "Author": "MiaRoller", "ReviewID": "UR100210956", "Content": "Just returned from 3 night stay.

I had lived on the Upper West Side some twenty plus years ago, so it felt like staying in a real New York neighborhood apartment, rather than a predictable tourist crash pad. The new decor is sort of hip urban-chic which transposes onto the vintage charm quite well. We had a king room on the corner, which was very spacious due to the round shape of the room. Unfortunately, that meant that the bathroom was quite small. This is an old Beaux Artes era building that has been updated quite effectively, but the architecture can be quaint or limiting, depending on your point of view. I found it charming. The ceilings are high and the windows large and overlooking Broadway. Again, the windows are a little drafty: charming or annoying? I didn't mind. In fact I liked not feeling hermetically sealed into a new building. The heat is very efficient from a cast iron radiator, which once you know how to control it, is great. It was off when we got into the room, but It warmed up quickly, once I turned it on. It can get hot, so no need to leave it on while we were out all day. The street noise can be LOUD all hours of the day and night. But I knew what to expect and my trusty earplugs insured me a great night's sleep in the very comfortable bed. I am a big fan of in-room coffee makers, so I was a little nervous about the absence of one in the room. But the 24 hr diner across the street delivers for free(tips, of course) and had piping hot, good coffee to the room in minutes after direct dialing it in. The afore mentioned Manhattan Diner is a very good value and the food is great. The location of The Belleclaire on Broadway and 77th made it a convenient spot to sightsee from. The proximity to the subway and crosstown bus on 79th was perfect, and safe even late at night. You can walk in any direction from the hotel and find any type of restaurant you could want. Great shopping and a real neighborhood vibe. The service at the hotel was OK, not that we needed anything beyond basic check in/out. Everyone was very nice. I really liked The Belleclaire. I would stay there again and would recommend it highly.

There are two small elevators which operate very well and can each accomodate 4 people and a couple pieces of luggage. The hallways have been renovated on the floors we were on.

The linens and towels were very white and clean and the room was tidy. The mattress and pillows were comfy. We also weren't happy with the lack of storage and the interior view. So they moved us to a room that had all those things + 3 drawers for storage but no rack over the toilet for our toiletries. So they moved us again to another room which had every things we needed, was a bit larger but had poor lighting and the bathroom had not been renovated beyond its fixtures.

Unfortunately, all the other rooms' a/c units were banging away all night so it was pretty damned loud.

Upper West Side seemed ideal... but: when we arrived, both elevators were out of use for repairs (why both at once?) so we had to use the service elevator, which was just dreadful, lined in hardboard. Great first impression! The room we were given, first floor, #114, smelt overpoweringly of solvent - apparently rubbing alcohol, used to clean the room. We couldn't open the lower part of the window, as it abutted the roof of the ground floor, and therefore was sealed for security reasons. We couldn't reach the upper part of the window, too high, the roller blind was jammed half shut, and the inner, venetian blind, was also jammed. The roof outside had on it a huge aircon unit, which was incredibly noisy, kept turning on and off all night, and there was litter all over the roof. The aircon unit in the window in our room had one knob missing, and a vent fell off onto the floor as soon as we turned it on to try to clear the smell. All the windows are single-glazed with aircon units in the lower halves, so rooms are dark and noisy. The staff were very helpful and apologetic, however, and the next day we were offered a change of room and a 20% rebate on our sleepless night. A full rebate would have been nicer... The room we got instead overlooked Broadway, on the 9th floor. We were offered a choice of a quieter alternative, but it faced a brick wall and the double bed was against the side wall, so only one side table and only oneside to get out of the bed - not great if you both need to get up in the night. So we opted for the Broadway view. Or, it would have been a view if the window hadn't been incredibly dirty. I tried to clean it with a tissue, just to be able to see out. No food at all in the hotel, but there was a GREAT diner across the street, Manhattan Diner, on corner of 77th and Broadway, open 24 hours a day. We ate there a lot. They do deliver to your room without charge, but there was no table or chairs to eat at, so a little difficult. There was a fridge in the room, but no kettle or coffee maker. A food supermarket was just round the corner, so we bought in stuff for breakfasts, including our own plastic cutlery and bowls. If this had been a cheap hotel, I wouldn't be complaining so much, but we paid about $860 (minus our $70 rebate) for 3 nights, which seemed extortionate for the quality provided.

The menu at Big Nicks adjacent to the hotel is also worth checking out - you'll need 20 minutes to read it but the food is cheap and excellent.

The bathroom was about the size of a closet and could only accomodate one person at a time, but it was enough room to shower and brush my teeth.

The best part was the neighborhood - quiet and clean. I've stayed at nice Times Square hotels before, but this is a gem regarding peaceful nights and the area is just a nice contrast from the dirty and sometimes sketchy New York streets.

Perhaps not overly friendly, but nice enough, and we weren't really expecting hugs - they were well informed and service was fast. The elevator indeed is tiny, but I don't understand the complains - it just takes you up and down, you don't sleep in the elevator. The hallways were very clean, I noticed there always were staff members around. We stayed in the queen bed room with a private bathroom.

What I also like about the Belleclaire is that it's in a more traditional Manhattan neighborhood, so you see people that live there or possible students from Columbia University on bikes, etc. vs. the last time we stayed on Times Squares and all that noise! Also, you are 2 very, very short blocks away from the 1 subway train which takes you north or south. (It's the Red colored train on the map) there are exchanges at 50th and there are tons of exchanges at 42nd St (this one is Times Square). Believe me...my son was a little overwhelmed the first day with the subway system but then the second day on he was completely fine getting around. That's why I chose Belleclaire as a test to see if he could handle the transfers of the subway system all on his own if he chooses to go to Columbia University or work on Wall St. and he figured it all out without me saying a word in 1 day...it's that simple. From Belleclaire which is on 77th St. you walk North to 79th st on the West side of the Road. You want to go to Times Square? Then you want to go South. You'll always go below the side of the street in the direction the car would be going if you would be driving. Next transfer your debit card in the machine and transfer to the subway card, again very simple....get on the 1 train...get off at 42nd street (like 4 exits down) walk up the steps and you're in time square. This is like 10 minutes. Going back from Times Square to Hotel Belleclaire be on the East side of the road (going North) just like you would be in a car take the steps down. You can use the Hotel's computer /printer to print out your boarding passes for 5 bucks the day before you leave which was nice, too. And the taxi ride back to LGA was around $35.00 which I thought was a decent price. Oh, and the Hotel is very close to Central Park like a 10 minute walk to the central part of central park but I don't advise entering the park without a map if you don't have a map with you since you may get lost with all the trails. Good Luck and Enjoy...can't wait to return and I'll be staying at Hotel Belleclaire and asking for room 629 again!!", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place\u201d", "Author": "Pencilbouquets", "ReviewID": "UR67119475", "Content": "This hotel was in a perfect location for exploring the Upper West side and other parts of Manhattan.

Our card keys stopped working; they were fixed no questions asked within a minute.

A call to the lobby resulted in a timid maintenance man spraying air freshener in the hall and clearly indicating to me that he didn't want to ask the other guests to stop smoking (when I finally convinced him to, the guest slammed the door in his face and the party continued).

We had an economy room which required us to share a bathroom with two others rooms. I'd never done that before and never will again. If you've never done it before, imagine delaying the start of your day - up to an hour or two - because you have to wait for people to shower before you. Imagine having to simply use the toilet quick but not being able to because someone is showering. That was bad enough, but the bathroom was down right gross. It reminded me of a camp ground bathroom. It was old, dingy & really dark (how difficult is it to replace the one dull light fixture??). There was no fan to help with the humidity after a shower, which I'm guessing is why there was black mold everywhere on the tile's grout. The drain didn't drain fast enough, so you ended up wading in a bath of water (gross when there could be hair in it from the previous person)! We couldn't seem to shut off the radiator/heater in our room, so even when leaving the window wide open (no screen) didn't help enough, we had to leave our window unit a/c on. It was less than 50 degrees out at the time. The window unit a/c caused problems itself, because the exposure to the outdoors (gaps around it that weren't sealed) made it sound like you were sleeping in a tent! The unit looked like something heavy had dropped on it from the outside, because it had a huge dent in it. We were just so suprised at the low standards & what they considered acceptable - something you'd expect from a college dorm room & not a hotel! The photos are misleading. You would assume the hotel occupies the entire building, and you walk into the front of it into a proper sized lobby. Nope - you enter on the side of the building (an entrance that you could easily miss), and the lobby is small & narrow. The two side by side elevators should be made into one normal size one. I'm not kidding when I say you cannot fit more than three people in it, and even that is cramped. I've never seen such a small elevator! The hallways where the rooms are are so narrow that in some parts we couldn't wheel a piece of luggage down it. We had to turn it on its side and pick it up. The place feels like a doll house. On a positive note... The staff was kind, and service (like housekeeping calls) was fast. The bed & linens were great, and the sink in the room was helpful. The location was the best part. The Upper West Side is a nice place to stay.

Overall it is the best hotel for the money, no complaints at all except they do have the worst irons known to man( put water for steam, ends up all over the place). That is the only thing i can come up with. The location is excellent... right in the city and little to no city noise. There are very convenient stores located all around. Blocks from central park, and right across the street is The Manhattan Diner... It is rated by Trip Advisor as the best diner in the city and let me tell you it could possibly be the best diner on the planet... Everything from the service to the plethora of food choices( my favorites are curly fries, rice pudding, shakes, cheese cake, waffles.... who am I kidding everything is delicious) is so timely, inexpensive, and just a joy to be there.

Before booking I called to make sure that it was going to be good for a handicapped person. I was travelling with my mother who had a knee replacement in October and is still healing. I made it very clear on the phone that we could not share a bed and there would need to be a bit of room to maneuver in the room. I was assured that even if I booked via Hotwire it would be fine, as the person on the phone took down my name (unfortunately I did not catch theirs). We get to our room, very excited as it would be my mum's first time staying over in NYC and we're in this gorgeous hotel that I've shown her the website/photos for. We open our door to find one twin/full bed, a desk, and a TV. There wasn't even enough room for 2 people to SIT on that bed, let alone sleep. The bathroom was small but very nice, and there was a large closet...space that could have been better utilized in my opinion. On top of this, the room stunk of what I thought was men's cologne - however it's one of the products the cleaning staff uses. I could tell instantly that my mother was extremely disappointed, as I had ASSURED her that everything would be fine and now it wasn't. We ended up completing all of our plans in NYC except for staying over and eating a traditional breakfast the next morning (which we were both quite excited for, I used to live in the city and sometimes miss it quite a bit). On the survey you get upon checkin, I explained to them exactly why we left early and why I was disappointed. I left my phone number and email address and honestly expected to at least hear from customer service. Not a peep. I'm actually going to be forwarding them this review as well, because that is *NOT* how you handle a situation. If your hotel isn't going to be suitable for someone, tell them when they call in and ask. Don't lie to them to make the sale and then screw them over when they get there.

The upper west side is a kid-friendly, easy access, quieter neighborhood, and riverside park is just two blocks away. The room had a small refrig, AC, heat, comfortable bed, clean bath, and we slept well . We really liked the hotel but the desk staff detracted from our stay. The cleaning service was very good and the rooms kept clean (i could walk barefoot on the floors without dirt). The doormen helped with questions, opening the door for guests and very friendly to everyone. It bothers me to make the following distinction but the friendly factor varied widely between the men and the women who staffed the hotel. As a working woman who tries to keep male female distinctions out of the work place, this was such an exceptional difference I feel I have to mention it. Our friends and us found the male staff at the door and at the desk very friendly and helpful. The women behind the counter were much less knowledgable or did not want to offer service, and at times gave the classic NY negative attitude. Two examples, a basic question about restaurants for breakfast and a repetivie problem with our room keys. On morning #4 we wanted to eat at a different location but was once again referred to Manhattan cafe for breakfast or to the European Bakery which we had been to on more than one occassion. I said that we had tried those already and inquired nicely if was there a third option, she looked at me and walked away to help another customer! With a classic NY attitude, because I pressed a second time, I recieved one other reference but it took a 5 min conversation to get the information, and required me to not be willing to go away easily. My husband was very frustrated when every day we had to get new room keys made. He was suprised when he was consistently chastised/ blamed by the women behind the desk because he was not taking proper care of the keys! The first day he was told that the metro card was demagentizing the room key. Sorry not possible! Day 2 he was told it was due to cell phones but we left our cell phones at home 3000 miles away so to be undistirbed by work phone calls! After a third example on Day 3 he complained later to another desk clerk (male) was told the real story. The desk clerk explained that those making the keys for us were not following the process correctly so they would only work until the next morning. Had the women only fixed the key and not blamed the traveler with such gusto we likely would not have found the experience so unpleasant.

After catching an earlier flight than expected, I arrived at the hotel at 10am and was pleased to find that my room was ready and I was given the key straight away. As you would expect for a budget room, facilities were basic but more than adequate. Flat-screen TV, desk, radio alarm clock with iPod dock, refrigerator, closet, and a night stand on either side of the (very comfortable) double bed. When I checked in, I was told that nobody else would be using the shared bathroom so I had it all to myself - it seems the other rooms along my part of the corridor had all been refurbished with their own facilities. I can confirm a couple of things from other reviews - yes there are some very noisy pipes in the hotel, and even though I enquired about changing rooms I was told that it wouldn't really make a lot of difference due to the age of the building. Also, one of their elevators is still out of order and the the one that works really is very slow! Noise was a bit of an issue for me in other areas - street noise all through the night (not helped by the laundry van which spent about half an hour outside every single night at around midnight), and the noise situation inside the hotel could have been better. The doors to the rooms are very heavy and will slam easily (and loudly!), and hanging the \"please do not disturb\" sign on the door seemed to be read as \"dear housekeeping, please vacuum this corridor as soon as possible\" which caused a bit of annoyance. It's true that these issues can be overcome eaily enough with the help of a decent set of earplugs, but it would be preferable for these issues to not exist in the first place. At least the ones inside the hotel - I understand there's not much anybody can do about street noise! Despite this, the hotel's location is excellent - just a minute's walk to 79th St subway station, and plenty of convenience stores and restaurants nearby. Central Park and the Museum of Natural History are just a couple of blocks east, which makes for an easy day's sightseeing. Would I stay there again? If I was on a similar budget, yes I would consider it, but I might also be tempted to save up a little extra money and try somewhere else. It was a great base to plan all of my activites from though, and I can't complain about the service I received from the desk staff on the few occasions I needed to ask for their assistance - if it wasn't for the pipes and seemingly inconsiderate housekeeping, it might have got that extra mark from me!", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "here", "Title": "\u201cGood for cheap\u201d", "Author": "dollyv", "ReviewID": "UR51486778", "Content": "I'm not a finnicky high maintenance type, and am in my forties, so I understand the concept of getting what you pay for, and that's exactly the deal at the Belleclaire.

I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend about two years ago. We wanted to take a NYC trip in the off season, and got some awesome rates on everything. Including this hotel, which was running a discount where staying 3+ nights would get you the 3rd free. We stayed in a double room with shared bath. It came out to about 50$ a night so it would have taken a lot to make us unhappy with the hotel. My dad who grew up in Queens recognized the name of this place and remembered it as being nice. Location: really good. Nice neighborhood. Just down the street from a subway station, across the street from an awesome diner, and there were little groceries (and a duane reade) along the street between the subway and the hotel. I mention the groceries/convenience store because we were lucky enough to get really bad colds during our stay and we were able to get the loads of cold medicine we needed without going out of our way. Room: we had a double with shared bath. We had no trouble using the bathroom/shower. I think I heard other people so I'm pretty sure one of the other sharing rooms was occupied, but we didn't see 'em. The room was adequately sized, but it's just a place to sleep and relax after running around all day. It was larger than the bed, which is more than I can say for more expensive rooms in other large cities. Radiator heat which made the room plenty warm when we turned it up. Enough that we needed to open the window and cool it down during the night. Staff: didn't see much of them, but they seemed friendly and they did their jobs. I recall the maid coming to our room multiple times while we slept in/got ready in the morning - she really wanted to tidy our room I guess. That was a pain, as we sort of wanted privacy to get dressed and all and she kept opening the door. Otherwise, we had no trouble. The front desk people helped us with directions and advice. They held our bags for free when we arrived before check-in. The lobby is really nice, too.

We recommend the Bellclaire, but please stay away from room 912. On check-in we were given this room, which at first seemed fine until the night when there was this horrible hissing and clanking noise coming from this peculiar vent (pipe) in the bathroom. There was noise also from the street however that did not bother me since this is New York City after all. My husband went down to the front desk to enquire about a room change and was told that because the Bellclaire is an older hotel, all of the rooms had this problem and they could not guarantee that if we changed rooms the noise would be any better. I decided it was worth the risk to stay in another room and we moved to room 511 the next day where I immediate check the bathroom to see if it had another one of those peculiar pipes. No pipe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no noise, and I had two very comfortable nights of sleep.

Filene's basement just a few blocks north for great discount shopping. A CVS drugstore not far away ... we even saw a movie ... the theater was also just a few blocks north. Subway stop very close by. The hotel staff were accomodating. Talk to Sare, the young door/bellman. I think he's a real up and comer in the hospitality field. Very helpful, always smiling ... remembers things ... a good kid. The room was small but adequate, pretty much as advertised. Sharing a washroom was not as bad as I thought it would be ... it's New York after all and no one lounges around the hotel much. One quibble ... I would have expected the shower curtain to be have been magnetized so it didn't ride in on you when you were taking a shower. And just one more thing: there's a small but funky gift shop in the lobby ... it even had three internet stations. This was important, because my wife's laptop wouldn't work in New York due to a company firewall. I must have spent an average of $15 dollars a day on the gift shop internet but I didn't mind due to the convenience. I thought that area of Manhattan would be crawling with Internet Cafes but it wasn't, most locals just go wireless wherever they are. The trouble is, I understand the gift shop will be shutting down in March when the lease is up and the hotel will use the space for something else.

The cab fare from Newark was brutal--book a car service if you can. The cabbie being from Jersey wasn't sure where he was going and the hotel was hard to spot due to construction, but we did find it. I booked the \"suite\" which suited it us well. I was a bit freaked by the web site saying some rooms had shared baths but the suite has one to itself, which with kids was a must. The suite itself is basically 2 rooms but with a partition wall with and opening--read no door. During down time it is pretty much impossible to have one room quiet or watch 2 different shows on TV as there is not way to stop the sound. But we weren't there for TV right. The hotel was under construction with one working elevator and a service elevator for use. Luckily we were on the 2nd floor so could use the stairs. I may have found this more inconvenient if we were higher up. The room itself is no frills but i wasn't there to hang out in my room. There were 2 good quality beds, a couple of chairs and a desk under each of 2 flat screen TV's. The maids forgot us one day and we had a backed up toilet another day. The maintenence fellow was very quick to respond to the plugged loo. Also it was chilly and we had to get him in to turn on the radiators--don't try this at home. Again he was quick and effecient, even bringing a space heater. Street noise was a nuisance because i am not accoustomed to noise and sirens all night long--but again NYC city that never sleeps--obviously not the hotels fault. And i suspect it was still quieter than other neighborhoods where we could have stayed. The location is great, with quick and easy access to subway and bus service. Definately get a metro card if you want to save some bucks. There are 2 reasonable markets close by and we had a small fridge--so milk, snacks and such in the room were no problem. It also felt like a really safe neighborhood, (although we did see a girl get arrested at the restaurant around the corner, for trying to skip out on a bill). I had no qualms about walking in the area at night or coming off the subway at night.

Starting in the massive queue for Abercrombie and Fitch. This is where it all went wrong. I began to feel ill, then started being sick, and could not stop. We struggled back to our hotel, only to be told that our room was still not ready, this was now 1.30pm. 51/2 hours after we left, and 31/2 hours affter the previous inhabitants should have checked out. The man was very rude, our bags had been moved to the new room so I couldn't even go and freshen up. He told us that without a manager to sign off the new room we couldn't even go up there. I explained that I was ill and just wanted a moment. He even had to give me a key to the general toilet because I needed to be sick again. Eventually he allowed us up but only to get some things out of our bag, and we had to be escorted. We went back out and I tried to soldier through. We came back to our room at 16.30 with a view to get ready to go out that night to Billy Elliot, my partner then started being sick, so we realised we must have food poisening. To this day the thought of pancakes and bacon makes me gag, as does it my partner. The lift smelt of food all the time, how when there was no rest on site? The lifts were slow and we often had to walk. Our key would never work when we got back to our room, we always had to go back to reception to change it, with the painfuilly slow lift this is no mean feat and a fun game to play, will we make it back before one of us is sick. We didn't see much of New York itself, we spent 36 hours non stop in bed, and didn't eat dinner or have one drop of alchohol, we would spend our days muddling through site seeing and then recover at night in bed. We still had a good trip but the hotel was a skank pit that I would never ever go back to. The sheets actually smelled like the lift did. When we left the doorman gave me all our bags because my partner was in the toilet and I had to drag them to the door myself. We then had to call our own taxi.

The beds were covered in white linens, comfortable duvet and fantastic pillows. I slept great. Movies, phone calls, playing the games, using WIFI were all additional in cost. No breakfast was included but nearby restaurants can deliver. We ate out at a grill across the street. It was very crowded but the food was good. Parking is expensive. We paid $40 for one night. We drive a mini van. We suggest taking a smaller car if you can. The room has a small refrigerator. The location is fantastic and near many local attractions, but wear comfy shoes if you plan to walk. I'm in my 40's and out of shape and managed just fine at first, but by the end of the day my feet killed me. The elevator is tiny and we ended up walking the narrow stairs most of the time. The staff are quiet but helpful. They could smile more. The hotel has character and despite it's age is perfectly good. The shampoo comes in little tiny jars and I would recommend bringing your own brand. Perfect for location. Noisy street outside. People are up all night and the sirens woke me up a few times from the fire engines. But it's a city and that's how a city sounds and to be expected. No privacy door between us and my teens so not the best room for a romantic time with the other half, when you bring the kids along.

This is crazy; most hotels don't do this any more. Our room was very noisy, thanks to an air con unit outside (not belonging to the hotel), but with ear plugs it didn't disturb our sleep at all. Chamber maids perhaps not brilliant; one day we weren't left any toiletries (I was relying on the shampoo and conditioner!), and another day we asked for an extra pillow and received even more towels, but no pillow. The next day the extra towels were taken away and not replaced (so not good if we really HAD wanted more towels), but still no extra pillow. Hotel: 3 pillows between 2 people are not enough. One of the lifts was broken; not a massive problem, but annoying. There was a full length mirror in our room but hung at about 5 foot from the floor, so we could only see ourselves up to our chests. Overall impression was that they are spending too much time on unnecessary things (changing beds and towels, crazy leather headboard) and not enough on essentials (sorting out nearby noise, fixing heating - our radiator wouldn't turn off).

I chose this hotel specifically for this reason and was not disappointed at all. Compared to the other hotels in the price range of 200USD, I found this one among the best. Rooms are spotless and are very large for a NYC hotel. We stayed in a two queen deluxe and it fitted to adults just fine. The flat screen TV is more like a PC monitor but nevertheless creates a nice modern touch in a very typical 60s NYC room. Wood floors and large windows add tones of character. I stayed at a room overlooking Broadway and the Fire Station. When combined, the two will be well enough to keep you up all night. If you are a light sleeper but still want to feel the wibe of the city when you are awake, get some earplugs. Otherwise, ask for a room facing the back of the building. Lobby area and the hallways of the hotel might be misleading as a first impression but this changes as you walk in and out. It feels as if you are going to your apartment rather than a hotel room. I liked that. Location is great. Right on Broadway and about a very enjoyable 15min walk to Central Park, with lots of places to eat on the way. Very close to the subway and plenty of busses stop right in front of the hotel. The dinner across the street is very good and convenient. They even deliver to your room, as the hotel does not have a restaurant. There are plenty of places other places to eat around. You can also find a few grocery stores, liqueur store and book store all within 10mins walking distance towards the Beacon Theatre. I think this is a very nice hotel with plenty of personality.

The Belleclaire was absolutely perfect for us because it was such good value for money. We had a family room for 4 (two interconnecting bedrooms plus ensuite bathroom). The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate. Both of the bedroom windows looked out on the quadrangle in the centre of the building. This made it a little dark, but again, not a problem. The room and bathroom were spotless. Some thought had gone into the decor and interesting modern furnishings. The only negative thing I can say about the room is that I found the A/C quite noisy. I was awake a lot of our first night. However, in all fairness, we were straight off the plane from London and rather jetlagged.

However, the radiator continued to make noises throughout the night. There is a fire station just across the road from the hotel and every night I was awoken at least twice by fire engines leaving the station with their sirens blaring. This problem could easily be overcome by the fitting of double glazing windows by the hotel. During our trip we were spending one night outside NYC.

A large fridge, and large LCD TV were fine, free WI-fi and the only thing missing of note being a room safe.

A small gift shop in the lobby also had internet access PC's for $3 for 15 mins and able to print out online tickets etc., plus they'll arrange a limo to the airport if you want - at $70 we thought it expensive but the drive out to JFK was log-jammed, took forever, and I dread to think how much it would have cost in a yellow cab. The location was great - 300 yds to the nearest subway (local Line 1) and 5 blocks to another, good diners and a supermarket and shops very close and good restaurants too, with Central Park in easy walking distance. I think I've worked out why this hotel gets such mixed reviews here - I looked in the doorway of some other rooms on our floor when the cleaners were doing their thing - it's clear some rooms have been modernised, whilst others haven't. Ours was classed by the hotel (but not on the internet booking site) as economy, so I suppose not only do you pay your money and take your choice, but it will be worthwhile making sure what type of room you are going to end up in, especially with some other reviewer's comments about the hotel messing up some booking arrangements.

We were impressed by the pictures on the internet, and found similar views in the lobby upon arrival, but after leaving the elevator we found slightly different accomodations. The hallways were narrow and stuffy and our room was fairly small with a brick wall view. We chose to get a room with a shared bathroom. This was ok as we never needed to use it when it was occupied, however it was a little dirty with standing water and soap scum. The room itself was very basic and again much different than the pictures we saw online. That said, we were in New York and didn't want to spend much time at the hotel anyways. If you're looking for an affordable hotel with no frills but a decent place to lay your head down, this one may work for you. The location was not bad, as it's right off Broadway in the upper west side. It's a couple blocks from central park and there are plenty of places to eat and shop in the nearby neighborhoods. The subway is within a block and cabs are plentiful on Broadway as well. Not the luxury hotel it appeared to be in pictures, but definately an economical option for the traveler that didn't come to New York for the bedding...", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cperfect for my family of 5\u201d", "Author": "itsallgoodVirginia", "ReviewID": "UR21682253", "Content": "We just spent 2 nights at the Belleclaire and it was perfect for our needs.

We had our own bath. Yes, the elevators are small...who cares? We took our luggage up, half of the family at the time. When it was just us, we all rode together. That was no big deal. We must have had a remodeled room as the bathroom was completely tiled walls and floors, the rooms looked much like the rooms on the website. My only complaint/suggestion is that they need a fan in the bathroom as the steamy shower leaves everything moist but we just opened the window a little..no big deal. The front desk staff was friendly and smiled and spoke each time we went through the lobby. The rooms were clean. I am paranoid of bed bugs in hotels and there was no sign of them so I was pleased. The beds were as comfortable as most hotel beds, we had what we needed and while not a great view, I enjoyed looking down at the people and traffic. We were so close to the subway and all kinds of good and reasonable food. The coffee cart on the street was only a dollar, the burger/pizza place around the corner (Nick's, I believe) was reasonable. There is a diner across the street but we did not try that. There are lots of parents/nannies out in the am with young children. It was a nice area and so accessible to everything you need.

We never saw any of the others in those rooms. When we needed the bathroom it was always available. The only down side as far as cleanliness was the shower wall.

The halways were small and so was the elevator. 4 people and a few bags made it seems like 30 piling into a vw bug :) The elevator was slow as well, but it served its purpose and was clean. We went into the trip thinking the subways were a place you wouldn't want to be after dark and that all New Yorkers had attitude. That was completely wrong. We had no trouble getting around on the subway. We got in at Penn Station as we flew into Philly and took the Amtrak (Saved us about $400 plus dollars to do it that way) We got on at the 34th street station and took the one up to the 79th to our hotel. Then got back on the one to 59th. Transferred to the D to Yankee Stadium 161st street, several times with no issue. I would suggest buying a metro card as soon as you get to town if you plan on getting around via subway. My wife lost her cell phone the day we were leaving.

They confirmed that it was available as expected. When I arrived at the hotel - about 7pm - they announced they had \"upgraded\" me to a double room. I had booked a king. I explained to the front desk person that in no place on earth was two double beds an upgrade from a king, but he said they were already sold out of the king rooms and that they could move me the next day. I agreed to this, but let him know I was dissatisfied. The room was ok, but it had more than a few things that I either didn't like or was ambivalent about.

There is a marvelous and extremely cost effective diner across the street, and an excellent grocer just around the corner on Broadway. There are wonderful bakeries nearby. Central Park is a couple of blocks to the east, the Hudson River a couple of blocks to the west. The hotel had a stellar staff. Check in was quick and pleasant.

For a major city, the room was large (2 queen beds) and clean. The bath and beauty products supplied by the hotel were more than sufficient and of good quality. The towels were soft and thick, and smelled wonderful. Our room had hardwood floors, and added to the feeling of cleanliness of the room. The only downside was that the air conditioner had a hard time keeping up with the intense July heat. I would guess this is not uncommon in hot, humid locales. I brought a small fan and am so glad I did. One other minor detail is that the hallways are not terribly glamorous. They're old looking - I guess reflecting the true background of the building. They also are not air conditioned, and I am a big fan of air conditioning during hot, humid summers.

Having never been to New York City before, nor really knowing the neighborhoods, I was understandably nervous about finding a nice place to stay. We were SO pleased with the Hotel Bellclaire. Parking: We arrived on a Sunday (having driven from Wisconsin) & the frontdoorsman was kind enough to help us find a chance spot to park on thet street. When it was time to move the car two days later, we selected the Hertz Rental Car garage on 77th street. They have a deal w/ the hotel & parking was only $25 a day- considering this is NYC, that is pretty reasonable. I was very nervous about having a car in the city since everyone says \"don't drive in Manhattan.\" All in all our experience was a good one. We left the car in the parking garage for the week & took the subway or walked. This Hertz lot is just up the street from the hotel so it was easy to walk, luggage in hand, to pick up our car the day we left town. The hotel: Lobby is small & nice. The staff typically greeted us with a \"hello\" each time we passed through. We were able to check in a bit early which was nice. At first the front desk staff couldn't find our Expedia reservation but after we presented our paperwork & the clerk checked a bit, all was well. The elevators (2) in the hotel are small but that's typical for an older building. As someone who is usually nervous about elevators, these worked just fine. We were on the 7th floor. I rarely saw anyone in the halls & thought the hotel itself was rather quite. Space in the city is at a premium & we thought that they made good use of space in our room (a queen sized bed, single bathroom). The decor is contemporary, flat screen tv, etc. We basically only spent enough time in our room to sleep each night. It was 80-90 degrees the entire week & we were so happy that the window a/c worked well. Neighborhood: This is a fantastic neighborhood. We always felt safe, even walking in the evening. Lots of grocery stores, restaurants, etc. Near the subway (5 min. walk at most) & 10 min. walk to Central Park. Overall: Personally I find these reviews to be rather nervewracking since people can have a random bad experience & then trash an otherwise nice hotel. I would say that this is a really great place to stay.

Nice neighborhood that is not TOO touristy but is easly accesible to tourist attractions (very close to subway, walking distance to central park and strawberry fields, close to the original Grays Papaya, 2 blocks from an AMAZING bagel shop, near sephora, with a really great grocery store literally about ten steps away). The hotel itself doesnt have a restaurant but there is a great diner right across the street called the Manhattan Diner that is very decently priced with delicious food that offers room service to the bellclaire! you have a number and menu right in your room, you just call them up and before you know it they are at the door of your room with your meal! I really couldnt ask for more at such a great price. Most dont see the appeal in booking the economy room which is a small room that has a shared bathroom (you only share it with two other rooms). Let me tell you, I have booked the economy room twice and there has never been ONE time where i needed to use the restroom or take a shower and couldnt because it was occupied. I pretty much felt like it was my own private bathroom, and though the other two rooms i shared the bathroom with were booked, i never ran into the people from those rooms or heard any noise, etc. The room is small, but EVERYTHING in New York is small, and if you ask me, its actually a GOOD size for a room in ny, ive seen new york apartments that small. In addition to that, if youre going to new york for vacation, you should only be in your room to sleep, change clothes , and shower. you dont need a room any bigger than that because you should be out enjoying everything new york has to offer, HOWEVER, should you happen to require more space, the upgraded rooms are considerably larger from what i saw walking by and from pictures they are a little more lavish. The workers there are very helpful and the housekeeper is also very friendly and helpful and very attentive to the rooms. All in all, I cant imagine getting a better deal anywhere else.

The air conditioning worked well as did the hot water in the bathroom. We loved the location-quiet and residential, but close enough to both Central Park and Times Square via subway. Nine members of our extended family also stayed at the Belleclaire for five days, and they were also very pleased with their rooms and the hotel in general. The only complaint I have is that we bought ticket vouchers from the conceirge for a Circle Line cruise. They were $6 and he informed us that it would guarantee our seats on the cruise. We just needed to get off the subway and it was a short walk to the pier. The walk turned out to be a lot farther than we had anticipated. We arrived at the pier, only to be told that the cruise was sold out. Neither the concierge, nor Circle Line would refund the vouchers. It was very frustrating. But that was the only problem we ran into. We would recommend Big Nick's Pizza, which is just around the corner, and has the biggest slices of pizza we'd ever seen. We would also recommend Europan (which is just a little north of the hotel) for bagels in the morning.

I was nervous due to previous reviews regarding the noise level in the hotel. This was not a problem for any of us! The room was small, but it's just a part of staying in NY. That is the way people live there so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only way to get the true feel of the city. The two other rooms in our group were double beds, but the size difference of their two rooms varied significantly. Theirs a good bagel shop down the street (I think it's called H&H) and another bakery just a bit closer to the hotel, on the same street, that had wonderful cheesecake and salads. The hotel is in a residential area, which I liked. The staff was friendly and helpful - only two problems-the desk told us how to get to Yankee stadium, then another worker @ the hotel stopped us to tell us another way because he lives in Brooklyn. He told us to take a particular subway that we later found out wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running on weekends! We wasted 30 minutes waiting on that train! I'm sure it was an honest mistake. Also, when we were leaving the hotel a black taxi was out front. He offered to give us a ride to the airport and the lady that works in the gift shop told me it would be safe and that she knew the guy. Well, he didn't understand which airport and when I noticed him going the wrong way I tried to clarify and he just said he's going a diff way. After arriving in New Jersey I told him again that we needed LGA so he stopped, turned around, got lost, upset other drivers (got yelled at lots along the way back to Manhattan) and we almost missed our flight. That man has no business driving people and he worked for Carmel so don't use them! He couldn't understand English, apparently. Honestly, I really did like this Hotel and would love to go back. The location is wonderful and located nearby the subway station. I felt very safe there, too. I didn't use the fitness center, but I heard it was tiny as well.

When we arrived at the hotel, I was a bit worried as, from the outside it doesn't look like much! However, inside its lovely, quite retro & very well presented. On checking in, the extremely helpful staff noted that we had opted to upgrade and then offered us a King room at no extra charge! We ended up with one of the round king rooms situated towards the front on the hotel. The room overlooked Broadway and the receptionist advised us to let her know if the noise from the road bothered us and she would move us. (We stayed in room 206) The room was fab! MASSIVE bed and flatscreen TV, Ipod docking station etc! You can hear the traffic but its not a very busy road at night, the odd truck or fire truck but nothing that caused any disturbed sleep!

Without wanting to repeat previous reviews, we got a great deal via expedia booking the flight and hotel together- at least half the price of advertised room rates, if not less. There are lots of positives to this hotel. Our room (908) was quite spacious, comfortable, very clean, no cockroaches, it had everything we needed and our towels etc. were changed every day. The bed was a little smaller than we expected, but this was remedied by getting a \"rollaway\" bed (ask reception) for $10 per night which was a single camp-bed on wheels. We took it in turns to sleep on it (its not as comfortable as a real bed) and it did the job. It will depend on which room you have as to whether you can fit in the rollaway bed - our room was plenty big enough. We shared a bathrom with 2 other rooms, as we were on a strict budget and this got us the best price. The bathroom is the only thing which wasn't satisfactory. The tiles were pretty horrid and old, but it was clean overall and we didn't have any problems with it being occupied when we needed it. My partner didn't like it at all and I had to force her to take a shower! The shower was hit and miss, and was difficult to get the temperature and flow to stay constant. One day it actually stopped whilst I was under it and I had to dip my head in the sink to rinse off my conditioner! I have to mention that if you are in rooms 908, 909 or 910, the shared bathroom window is right next to a large ventilation chute which serves one of the eatieries below. It pumped out awful smelling greasy cooking smoke and fumes most of the time, which was pretty nasty, so the bathroom window was kept closed, for fear that we would exit the bathroom more smelly than we had enterered it! I would assume that the bathrooms on the floors above and below would also be affected. Basically, if you insist on having a great bathroom, the Belleclaire is not for you. If your room is Broadway side, you should definitely bring earplugs, as the road is noisy 24/7, even with the window closed. As our room was hot, we needed the window open. Our radiator made strange noises (we likened it to Chinese water torture!) which woke us up most nights, even with earplugs in, but that was not a big deal for us. The neighbourhood is fantastic and the hotel is located perfectly for getting around on the subway - the number 1 line is very convenient. We loved Manhattan Diner and ate there every day, mainly for breakfast. Their burgers and salmon nicoise salad are excellent too. Highly recommended. Ruby Foos across the road is very nice, but more pricey (if you are from the UK, don't order their peking duck, because it isn't half as nice as what you will be used to). We tried lots of eateries in the area and all except one were lovely. The worst was Nico's which is on the corner a little way up from the hotel - the moussaka was awful! For an amazing steak (pricey though) we recommend Michael Jordan's restaurant in Grand Central Terminal (on the 1st floor). It is fab to watch all the commuters bustling about below - a great experience. We also went to Gallagher's steakhouse (West 52nd and Broadway) which was recommended by reception and that was pricey too, but not as nice as Jordan's at Grand Central. All in all, for a budget hotel, the Belleclaire was a super find.

The room was fairly small (not suprising as we ARE in NY) but everything was clean. There was also a sink in the room as well as in the shared bathroom. The room was always warm even though it was around 3 degrees celsius outside. Service from the reception staff was excellent and friendly. The hotel lifts are quite small but well maintained. Small amenities like soap, shampoo, showercap etc were also provided. The towels were also quite thick and soft. The only negative was that while the shared bathroom was quite large (including toilet) it had poor lighting. The bathroom tiles were dark green as well, reducing the light. The hotel is across from the excellent Manhattan Diner which has awsome breakfasts for a very reasonable price. We paid about $20 (including tax and tips) for two people. The food was great, very large servings and free refills of coffee. If you are from Australia etc where people usually have milk with their coffee, ask for a glass of milk, as cream is the standard in the USA.

People don't go to New York to hang out in their hotel room, but even as a place to hang our hat, there were some drawbacks. Yes, the room was tiny - the person sleeping closer to the window had to walk sideways to get between the bed and the table to get to the door. And why they even bothered putting a chair in there, I don't know - the only place a person could sit was by the sink, which defeated the purpose of having a desk in the room. Secondly, the room was _hot_ when we checked in - and even with the radiator turned all the way down (and the fan on, for white noise) the room was still overly warm. I wish we'd sprung the extra $100 for a private bathroom - unlike other reviewers, our shared bath seemed to always be in use by occupants of the other two rooms whenever we wanted (i.e. needed!) to use it. And the bathroom was NOT clean. There were bits of plaster on the floor and a broom left behind (were we supposed to clean it ourselves? ;-)) and the wall tiles in the shower were darkened with mildewy build-up that have been, I take it, left untouched by bleach or Ajax.

There is metered parking in the street or plenty of garages to choose from, and subway is also nearby. The hotel is only 15 minutes by car from Yankee Stadium or Times Square, and just a few minutes' walk from Central Park and the major museums. Front desk staff are especially helpful.

The price was great! Couldn't get anything near that price. The location is good. I would have hated to be right on top of Times Square. There were so many people there that week, being down there at all made me claustrophobic. The Belleclaire is just a two minute walk to a subway entrance. You can take that down to 42nd street station and catch a train to anywhere you want to go. A couple of late night eats were around the corner but they weren't that great. Anyway- the reason the price was so great is because you have to share a bathroom with two other rooms. There was one door that a key card would let you into that was just a hallway with 4 other doors, three rooms and a bathroom. We never had too much of a problem getting to use the bathroom whenever we wanted to. It was a bit of an adventure because a young couple had the room next to us and they wouldn't stop fighting for 3 days. The walls are very thin so we could hear a lot of what they we're saying. It really didn't bother us much though. We made a show of it because they kept fighting in the hall too. We looked out the peep hole for a couple good hours of laughs and entertainment. The rooms were very small moderately clean, thought we did kill a cockroach in the room one night. There is no view, just look out the window to a brick wall. The beds were comfortable and the linens appeared clean. Bottom line is if you are looking for a bed with a lock on the door and a low price and not much else, this place is for you.

We had a late arrival (around 11:30 p.m.) and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. After the prompt check-in, we took the tiny elevator up to our queen suite. It was just as small as I had expected for a New York City hotel. The room was immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable. The only downfall was the tiny sink in the bathroom, which we kept splashing water on the wall and floor because it was so compact. Also, there is not proficient lighting in the bathroom. We decided to order food from the Manhattan Diner across the street - they deliver 24/7. The food was okay, but very overpriced for what you get. The location is great - blocks from Central Park, museums, and the subway. After 2 nights, we decided to extend our stay, but we downgraded to an economy room with a shared bath to save some money. The staff was extremely helpful with our last-minute booking. Not to mention that the shared bath was not as bad as I had expected. The bathroom was accessed by room cards only (shared between 3 rooms), and we never had a problem getting in. Also, the bathroom was very clean. Be sure to visit Big Nick's Burger and Pizza Joint (open 24 hours), located just downstairs on 77th & Broadway. They have a huge 27 page menu, covering everything from breakfast to dinner to everything in between. Extremely reasonable prices and fabulous food.

When checking in, one of the other couples were told that they had no reservation, but they had the booking email so they were given a room after 15 mins. When my boyfriend and I went to our room, on the 5th floor, we were shocked by the state of the corridor, there were pieces of furniture and large boxes all over, and we could barely pass by with our luggage, so we were fairly anxious about our room. however, our room had two double beds, really nicely decorated and even had a flatscreen TV and a little fridge. The bathroom was spotless, and our towels and bedlinen were changed every day. The room was a little warm, couldn't turn off the heat for some reason, but had air-con also. It was really comfortable and clean, which was all we wanted for our stay. The other 2 couples had only one bed in their rooms but paid the same rate, so i suppose we were just lucky. There's no restaurant at the hotel but the Manhattan Diner is across the street so we had breakfast there every morning and headed off on the Subway to go sightseeing for the day. The Diner also supplies room service to the hotel, which we didn't use, but its open 24/7 so its really handy. There's also a gift shop at the entrance of the hotel, and the staff there were really helpful, they were able to arrange a bus for us back to the airport when we checked out, and the hotel stored our luggage for the day as we were flying out late that evening, so we could go get some more sights in.

Of course, being uptown you are not close to the \"action\" like you would be downtown, but the area is quiet and very safe as a hotel base. You also have fewer subway lines to choose from (well, there's only 1 very close by), but for me it's not a problem.

We only used the room to sleep and spent the majority of our time exploring the city. We stayed in a room with the shared bathroom which made me slightly nervous. I actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell my husband about it till we arrived cause I figured he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to stay some place else, but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justify spending an extra $150+ per night just for a bathroom. But, all was good and we never had any problems. We never ran into any when we wanted in the bathroom and it was never dirty or gross. We did wake up early each morning and were out of the hotel by 8AM though. The only thing that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like about the hotel is that it was SUPER hot in the room. Even though it was the middle of December, we had to sleep with the window up and it was still hot. The elevator was pretty small too, but we are young and healthy so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind walking the seven flights up to our room giving others a chance to ride on the elevator. The hotel is on the West Side and conveniently located near two subway stations. There is a 24 hour grocery store right around the corner along with some restaurants. We loved the pizza shop that was beside the subway station. Central Park is also only a couple of blocks away. Belleclaire is away from all the hustle and bustle of the city, but it is close enough to jump on the subway and be there in mere minutes. If it is your first time to the city, I would highly recommend trying out the Grayline bus tours. You can see a lot in a few days by hopping on and off the bus and any time. It is well-worth the cost. We were able to do the holiday lights tour (since it was around Christmas time) on the bus and it was awesome. We were able to cram in so many different landmark sites in just a few days by riding the bus. If you go to Central Park, take a carriage ride. It is pretty amazing. Also, purchase the metro card for the subway -you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll save $$. Overall, I would recommend the Hotel Belleclaire. It is a great budget hotel.

Our room shared a bathroom with two other rooms, but there was never a point when either my partner or myself went to use the bathroom and it was already in use. I feel that choosing a shared bathroom is a fantastic way to save money when staying at the Belleclaire .. Why spend money on having your own private bathroom when you can share one and have much more money to spend in those wonderful NYC shops! Once we arrived in our room I was pleased to find that it was of a decent size, was very clean and best of all .. the beds are probably the comfiest I've ever slept in, perfect after a hard day of New York life! In our room there was a TV, games, a fridge, a sink, a large storage cupboard, air con, radiators and your other basic bits and bobs that you would expect in a hotel room. The view wasn't fantastic (unless you really like brick walls) but there was a blind and curtains anyways so it wasn't like it was staring you in the face all day. Our rooms were cleaned and our beds made up daily which I've heard is uncommon in other budget hotels. The hotel didn't offer its own restaurant but did offer delivery from the fantastic restaurant/diner over the road. I do belive the restuarant is called simply the Manhattan Diner, and it is ideally situated for breakfast before a hard day shopping and sightseeing! The food is delicious and the service is the fastest and most efficient I've ever seen, add that to the bargainous prices and we have a winner. The hotel is situalted in a lovely little neighbourhood in the upper west side of Manhattan. Its quite quiet but only a short Journey from the hustle and bustle of the city. By foot, it is approximately 10 minutes to Central Park/Museum of Natural History and only 35 minutes walk from Times square. There is easy access to nearby subway stations, which make your jouneys all over NYC only a matter of minutes long .. I'd definately reccomend you use the subway in the afternoon when your feet start aching that little bit .. they will thank you later on! There are lots of nice local shops near the hotel and also a few small supermarkets to stock up on snacks and drinks for your hotel room. On our second stay in New York, when we left the hotel to walk into the city on our last day we were greeted with knee deep snow which was quite a shock! Little did we know we were about to be caught up in the biggest snowstorm NYC had seen in a long time. We called our pre-booked shuttle bus service to check that our transportation to the airport was still okay and they confirmed that everything should be fine. We checked out of our room and left our bags at the hotel whilst we went for some breakfast. Upon returning to the hotel we found out our transport to the airport had been delayed by hours so the hotel staff allowed us to set up camp in the foyer! Hours later we were eventually given the information that we would not be getting any transport via our pre-booked shuttle bus and that we had to make our own way there as it was not safe for such vehicles on the roads. The hotel staff were very helpful at this point and found us an alternate route to the airport (which involved walking, catching subways and busses and took a few hours) and gave us verbal and printed directions and timescales. If they hadn't been so helpful we would have probably still been there now! Overview: Hotel Belleclaire 250 W. 77th Street Corner of Broadway New York NY 10024 Basic, cheap and comfortable accomodation. Shared bathroom rooms are much better value. Close to subways and Central Park. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice neighbourhood.

We went for the shared bathroom accommodation and it was ok. Our room was one of three in it's own lobby behind a swipe card operated door. The reason for this is to keep our allocated bathroom for use only by 3 rooms. One downside to this was that there were now 2 extra doors banging whenever any of the other guests in our little area came through or used the bathroom. Some people seem happy to let doors swing shut loudly as opposed to closing them gently. Oh well. Our room overlooked the corner of 77th Street and Broadway and although it was on the 9th floor it was a bit noisy. New Yorkers love to use the horns on their cars! Also the local fire station was nearby which resulted in us being woken by loud sirens in the middle of the night a few times. We breakfasted at the Manhattan Diner opposite the hotel where you can get a filling breakfast for $5-\u00c2\u00a36. The local subway is about 3 minutes away so getting to other areas was easy. There is a cinema about 5 minutes walk away. Central Park is nearby and genarally the area feels safe. Barnes and Noble bookstore is also about 5 minutes walk - a very nice shop.

The hotel is mentioned and recommended in many reputable guidebooks, such as the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to New York (2006) and the Time Out New York guide (2006). Most of the TripAdvisor reviews have been favorable, and it was mainly on the TripAdvisor recommendations that we decided to book a queen-bed room with a shared bath for the rate of $129 per night... a real deal when compared with the going rate for other hotel rooms on the Upper West Side, all of which were asking $250-300 a night for similar lodging. We booked in July and received an e-mail confirmation the next day. Two weeks ago, prior to our arrival, I e-mailed the hotel and asked if they could give us a room away from the front of the hotel, since many TripAdvisor reviews mentioned loud street noise at night... something we would find hard to put up with. When we arrived at the hotel, we were given #524... our wish had been granted! You use your key to enter a door which leads to a small vestibule where rooms 523, 524, and 526 are located. The shared bath for these three rooms is located off the same vestibule. The room was small but perfectly clean, with a small sink in one corner, a closet with ironing board, iron, and extra blankets; a nice 19\" Samsung flat screen TV; and a utilitarian table and folding chair. A good supply of heavy cotton towels and a cotton bathmat were waiting on the table. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was completely quiet at night; the window opened onto an interior courtyard, and there was no street noise whatsoever. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in, with nice thick pillows and a warm comforter. New York was sunny and cool during our stay, so we used the AC unit fan to bring in fresh air from the outside, since the window did not open. The air was refreshing, and even the low hum of the fan was a pleasant \"white noise\" which aided sleep. The shared bath was SPOTLESSLY CLEAN at all times. Only once did we encounter other guests on their way in or out of it. We could only deduce that the hotel staff keeps a close eye on the shared baths and ensures that they remain clean. Water pressure from the shower was good, hot water plentiful. The hotel staff are cordial, friendly, and accommodating. A doorman greeted us and held the door nearly every time we entered or left the buliding. As many TripAdvisor members have mentioned, the Manhattan Diner is on the NE corner of 77th and Broadway, just steps away from the hotel entrance, and you can't find a better place in the neighborhood for a hearty breakfast. We often selected the #5 breakfast: two eggs any style; a choice of bacon, ham, or sausage; toast, butter, and jam; a substantial glass of orange juice; and unlimited cups of excellent coffee... all for $5.95. The menu is extensive, and you could easily have all your meals here for a very low price. Around the corner on Broadway, just a few feet south of the hotel, the Westside Market offers a full line of groceries as well as beer & wine, cheeses, breads, deli salads, and even sandwiches for take-away. It's a fabulous place to buy food and supplies. If you were on a tight budget, you could put together a wonderful meal just from this market and enjoy it right in your room. Our room was small, with not much space to move around the perimeter of the bed. But we used the room only to sleep, and with a rate of only $129 per night, we felt that we had made the perfect choice. We easily saved $125 to $150 a night, and the savings were spent on theatre tickets, museums, and restaurants. Staying here is very much like staying in a tourist-class hotel in Europe.

I would select for economical reasons, perhaps, Milford Plaza or Hotel Edison. Friends of mine have stayed there and enjoyed themselves. HOTEL BELLECLAIRE: The hotel is small and currently being renovated on some floors. My senior mother and I could have cared less about the elevators. We were on the third floor and used the stairwell. In my opinion, this is not a place for children or teens. The hotel rooms are small, the televisions barely work, but that being said, it was fine for us. Honestly, I think it depends on what you are looking for. We did reject one of the bigger rooms on the 7th floor because the carpet was badly stained. The front desk is friendly and accomodating and changed our room immediately. My mother's room and mine were both clean (315 and 318). The view was nonexistent and the air conditioners rather loud. The bathrooms were spotless; no problem with hot water and I think the tile was new. The bed was comfortable and I smelled no unpleasant odors. I have a nose for mold, mildew, and other unpleasantries.....every thing was fine. I also have trouble sleeping at night, but found no problem here. It is an older place, however, the paint is fresh, a brownish-yellow, and the carpet looks somewhat newish. The halls are narrow, if you are on the big side, hmm.....find a bigger place. I noticed that there were a lot of airline staff who stayed here as well. The location, for me, was excellent. I wanted to stay in a residental area, to see more of the REAL New York, and so I did. The subway is two blocks away and you can get to Times Square in five minutes if you have two dollars. Not a bad deal! The area is safe, too. Just around the corner is a grocery store, with a huge selection of cheeses, chocolates, deli items, and imported beers. There is a great \"trendy\" breakfast place on Amsterdam called Sara Beth's. It is a local favorite and if you want a good Jewish breakfast, somewhere on Broadway (that's your street) and hmmm......86 or 87, you can find incredibly fresh lox, herring, etc. If you ask, once you get to that area, people would know the name.

The location was very good, central park is only two blocks away, there are subway stations nearby and a bus is also going from the 72th street - which is much nicer than the subway, if you have the time. There are supermarkts, food places and plenty of city life; if you like you can also get to many attractions by foot. The staff was generally friendly and helpful.

I told the agent the amount we were quoted and he said that my amount was totally incorrect and in no way would anyone quote that. However, when I whipped out a printout of an email sent to me by the \"Reservations Manager\" with the original quote, let's just say the upper hand had changed. He went to speak to this person and supposedly it was still an error. We still ended up paying only $50 over our original quote, because it was still an error- (BY A MANAGER???!!). Honestly, we were too jet lagged to argue any more. Be advised that despite this issue, (which can be simply avoided by getting an emailed copy of your total rates including taxes) we enjoyed our stay at the Belleclaire. All the bellmen we encoutered were very helpful and very polite. The rooms were clean and everytime we called the desk with requests, they were answered immediately. yes the elevators are small to fit barely one person and their luggage, however, that's what the bellmen are for so just ask. They have a freight elevator to handle that issue. The room we stayed in contained a fridge, iron, cd alarm clock, tiny dresser, closet, hair dryer, and even liquid soaps, lotions, shampoos, and conditioner. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is awesome. Safe quiet, and far enough from the touristy Times Square area. There are also lots of shops and restaurants a few steps away from the hotel. The subway is a little more than a block away- I would suggest using it since cabs can get pricey if you're hanging out in the lower areas of manhattan like we did. If you're more than 2 in your party, take advantage of the transportation options they offer at the little shop located at the entrance of the hotel.

We could not figure out how to get the heat turned down, and it was too hot. So we propped open the window. We could do this since we were on the third floor, but on the first floor, it would not be safe. Also, the elevators are very small and very slow. We just walked most of the time, but if you were on a high floor, it might be a problem. Also, it would be a problem when you check out with your luggage. The TV also was bad.

Also provided were tv, iron/ironing board, refrigerator, and in-room sink. Would have been nice to have a comfortable chair in the room. My room was in a suite with a shared bath (3 separate rooms per one bathroom). Despite the proximity of guests, I only heard the doors being opened and shut (loudly, actually). There were no problems of guests converging on the bathroom. Also, the bathroom was very clean - much appreciated. Downsides: 1) These three rooms & bath were \"hidden\" behind an outer door to the hallway. I wouldn't want to be caught in a fire in that configuration! 2) Window looked out to an unattractive building next door; absolutely no view. 3) The room was way overheated. I attempted to turn off the (noisy) radiator, which helped a little. But generally, just way too hot at all times; no air whatsoever (the weather had suddenly warmed up from the previous cold week). Also, more comfy furniture in the lobby would have been nice (only had benches), as I had to check out at noon, but transport to the airport didn't arrive until 2:30.

We found that the Hotel entrance was round the corner of a side road and that some scaffolding was constructed on one part of the building. One we had got into the lobby, it was very pleasant and the reception area looked very nice. They had a gift shop on site that you could log on to the internet. it was $3 for 15 mins. They sold all kinds of New York gifts and merchandise. They also sold tickets to tours, and can book the transfers to from JFK airport for you. Talk to the guy in the shop and he can give you Macys passes and can give you friendly advice about clubs, bars, pubs to go to etc... Aparently the 3rd floor had fire damage to it, that is why the scaffolding is there. They are refurbishing the hotel. We checked in with ease, and the staff were quite helpful. You have to sign an agreement and give over your credit or debit card to cover any events or charges that may occur (phone, extra nights etc...) and it says you must check out by 12.00pm otherwise you get charged for an extra nights stay. The Hotel had three lifts that you could use to go up to your floor. Sometimes the workmen would use them so we had to wait for another one, or use one of the others. We stayed on the 8th floor (the hotel had 10 floors). The room number was 814 and it was a double room with en suite bathroom. (toilet, bath, shower). Quite small though, and it took quite a while for the hot water to come through. Some of the tiles on the floor were a bit grubby but nothing to bad. It had a nice double bed and a TV with satelite. (MTV, Comedy, Childrens etc...) at no extra charge. The view was a bit constricted, but the room itself was pleasant and spacious. It had a dressing table, Wall mirror and a wardrobe with an iron, and a hair dryer. Also the room had a fridge in it (full sized). You could order room service if you wanted to. As for the location of the Hotel we found that it wasnt bad, but was quite some trek from all the main attractions. Most of the time we walked, but we got the yellow cabs sometimes. Central park is a short walk away down West 77th Street. The Restaurants we recommend in close proximity to the Hotel are the Manhatten Diner (Directly opposite), and the Cafe 52 which is just a short walk down from the Manhatten Diner. It was actually my 21st Birthday whilst we were in New York, so we went to the Tavern on the Green which was at 66th street, West Central park. Beautiful Restaurant! Nice surroundings. And the food was delicious. Some things not to miss whilst in New York are:- A Horse and carridge ride around Central Park (Try to find the Horse named Billie, he was a saint!) And do a deluxe ride for about $75. Also you have to try Ice skating. We skated at the Wollman Rink and it cost about $24. A Helicopter tour (we had one pre-booked) With Liberty Helicopters on 30th street. This was about \u00c2\u00a333 each for a 10 minute ride taking in the statue of liberty, the bronx, Central park, the empire state building, manhatten and the Stadiums! Take a City Sites tour starting at Times Square its a hop on hop off bus tour that takes in everything! It was Brilliant. The company we went with were City Sights. Jose was our guide and he was very funny! And factual of New York. Of course there is the Staue of Liberty, Times Square, Empire State Building, Bloomingdales, Macys, The Chrysler Building, Grand Central Station, The UN head quaters, The Rockefeller Centre and Central Park to name but a few. Plus the thousands upon thousands of shops. In all a great trip! Just make sure all your transfers are sorted before you leave! They have a room to store luggage in that is quite secure.

I had several concerns about the quality of the room we rented over the internet and the subsequent disinterest of the management staff to rectify our complaints. When we arrived at the hotel on Tuesday the 21st we checked into room 228. Sadly, the room that we had anticipated being a two room family suite was nothing of the sort. We were shocked to see how small the rooms were and that there was no sitting area that would define a suite. We had to climb OVER the bed in the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in order to access the bathroom and there was very little space to set up a crib for my infant son. Not only were we disappointed that there was no common area between the rooms, but we were shocked at how sticky the carpet was. The mold on the bathroom shower curtain and the stains on the alarm clock speaker were disgusting. Furthermore, the window air conditioning unit had only two settings: off or freezing cold and was unacceptably loud. Our first morning in New York I spoke to the desk clerk who assured me that we could move to a larger suite. When we returned from our day of sightseeing, I was told that the hotel was sold out and a move was impossible. (How could such a terrible hotel be sold out?) The reservations manager cared very little about our complaints, was condescending and had no desire to meet her customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs. My attempts to speak with the General Manager went unanswered. We left several messages for her, including a cellphone number where we could be reached, and not once did she make an attempt to contact us in order to avoid this issue being brought to the owner's attention. Who, by the way, ignored my letter of complaint. We are reasonable people and simply wanted to be moved to a room that reflected the price we paid for the accommodations, as advertised.

LOCATION On 77th street, fairly easy to find - just about on the corner but entrance/facade is low-key. The reviewer who mentioned the website gave a wrong impression is certainly right! Just a few minutes away from the Subway though, with a great supermarket round the corner, as well as loads of shops, diners - don't miss Gray's Papaya and H&H Bagels just 3 blocks away! The area didn't seem very rough at all. ROOMS Rooms were spacious enough, not too small or too big and with a fridge, all the usual - ironing board, hair dryer, cable TV. Do not expect great views but the room was very clean and functional. Fridge was especially handy, and there was an air-conditioning machine which was handy for the humid nights. Shared bathroom was not a problem, or noise but I guess my neighbours were courteous which may not be everybody's experience. SERVICE No problems here - everything that I'd asked about was efficiently answered and I even got a complimentary travel plug! AMENITIES Small gym located on the 1st floor, which I didn't use but had a quick look round. Again, functional for most people's needs with a dumbell rack, cardio and weights machines. No restaurant. Lift was out of order on one occasion, had to use the stairs - to the 9th floor!

Technically, this was accurate. However, the rooms, bathroom and closet (yes, only one closet) combined were smaller in area than many single hotel rooms. Although the suite was supposed to be able to house up to 5 people, it was cramped for our 3 adults and one child. If we hadn't pre-paid for four days, we would have walked out and taken our chances elsewhere. The bathroom is accessible only through one of the rooms; if someone in the other room needs to get up in the middle of the night, he has to walk into the sleeping person's room. The closet is in the other room. The two rooms had a total of three small drawers, ONE chair, and NO box of tissues. There were none of the amenities one expects from just about any hotel these days -- coffeemaker, continental breakfast, etc. There was a small refrigerator, but no microwave, and no sink except the one in the bathroom. Let's talk about the bathroom. Among the 3 adults with us, we had experienced literally hundreds of hotels on four continents over at least five decades. This bathroom easily won the prize for the smallest and least user-friendly ever. The sink is so tiny that you can't help splashing water on the floor just by turning on the faucet. There is ONE towel bar (to hold enough towels for up to 5 people?) and ONE hook behind the door, no shelves, even within the shower area (to put one's shampoo and such). The fan was broken from the moment we arrived. We told the people at the front desk, who said they'd send someone up to look at it. Maybe they did, while we were out, but all they did was look; it was never fixed in the time we were there. Generally speaking, it was a dump -- who gave this place 3 stars? The window unit air conditioners were junky; not only were they mismatched and unattractive, but they made loud clanking and knocking noises all night. There was a hole in the wall of one room. (I once stayed in a German hotel that was about this bad -- I think there was a blood stain on the wall -- but it cost only about one-fifth what this place cost!) The clientele was the best part. We shared elevators with such a variety of characters! There were the two young \"ladies\" who used profanity in front of our 11-year-old, and the father who took his child out of her stroller and then didn't have the courtesy to fold up the stroller to make room for another person (and I believe several other reviews have mentioned how small the elevators are).

The hallways were very musty and devoid of oxygen. We eventually found our room (all 100 square feet of it) at the back of the hotel, and it was scary. A few \"features\": filthy carpets with black stains, no dresser, that fresh \"uriny\" smell, stained acoustic panels above the bed, a dented mini-fridge, and a tiny AC unit sticking out of the window that made more noise than a Kindergarten class at recess but failed to cool the sweltering room.

There is a great diner across the street and fun little grocey stores close for getting odds and ends. There is also a refrigerator in the room which is great for snacks. The beds are comfortable with clean white sheets and a duvet. The water pressure of the shower was also good. They also provided a safe in your room. As for the bathtub, ours did not have a working stopper which made it difficult to give our toddler her bath efficiently.They were very stingy iwth soap, shampoo etc. They only gave us 1 set over the 3 nights even though our products were running low. The elevators rarely were both working and when they were they were slow and very very small. The desk staff could not provide us with a copy of the bill when we left as we purchased our room through expedia which made it difficult with submitting the hotel bill for my husband for his work. The room felt cramped. The heating system was ancient and you could not shut it off even when it was hot, so we had to run the a/c with the heater on. The windows were very old and not very clean. Our view was off the main street so our room was quiet. Overall, the price was very reasonable for NYC and we were fairly prepared for this class and style of room. When we moved to the NYC Hilton on 6th if was like night and day but the prices were considerably higher at the Hilton.

The shared bath was newly tiled and extremely clean. I was concerned when we got out of the elevator during the second visit that all of the rugs were covered with brown paper and there were ladders and construction equipment in evidence.

Perhaps they put air conditioners in the windows, but there were none in evidence when we stayed there, nor was there any central air conditioning or a fan. A large, heavy floor-to-ceiling drape hangs over the window and doesn't open. If you book during warm weather, I would definitely ask about this.

I could control the heat in the room to my liking, and the room was exceptionally quiet even though it overlooked upper Broadway. I had two windows, one looking northeast over Broadway, the other west over the rooftop, so there was lots of natural light (and good cross-ventilation in the summer, I would imagine). The room was clean, bright, and the bed VERY comfortable (especially nice after hoofing it around New York each day). The colour television was nice, but rarely used -- I was in New York after all, so had little desire to sit in front of a t.v. when the world beckoned at my doorstep. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and added to an enjoyable stay. The neighbourhood was great: very safe and quite quiet at night -- two short blocks to the subway (#1 and #9 lines), lots of shops and eateries (Zabar's gourmet food emporium 2 blocks north; the art-deco Manhattan Diner across the street offering hearty and inexpensive breakfasts), and public art in the form of playful bronze statues running up the centre median of Broadway at periodic intervals. Very close to Central Park (just 2 blocks to the east), which made getting to Christo and Jeanne-Claude's \"The Gates\" installation a breeze.

It is only a 3 block walk to the Museum of Natural History and the Gray Line NYC sight seeing tour pick up point. An excellent diner (The Manhattan Diner) is located across the street corner from the hotel. Internet is available in the concierge room for a pricey $3.00 per 15 minutes. A better bet is a little copy shop next to the Manhattan Diner which charges $2.00 per 15 mins. Due to competitive pricing (for NYC) and good position in a safe neighbourhood, we would definetely stay here again (although, preferably spend a few extra $$ and get a room with out own bathroom).", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, S.Wales", "Title": "\u201cOk for the money, nice location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2570723", "Content": "We upgraded to this hotel after reading the awful reviews about our original booking at the Carter Hotel (2 of Ebookers favourites it seems). We had a 2 bedroomed suite, on the positive side the beds were big, comfortable and clean. The shower was a blaster and always hot water. And thats it for positive, the rest of the room was quite shabby and had not seen a wet wipe for a while. The TV and AirCon worked and we had one coat hanger for the four of us. Location was good, we felt really at ease in this neighbourhood. Did'nt really have much interaction with the staff, however young bellboy Sare was really friendly and helpful.

The location was excellent - the hotel itself, quirky. I'd read that it had recently been totally renovated, but the walls of our room had scuff marks and paint smears on them. There's not a single piece of artwork on the walls, either, which renders the hotel very stark. The window airconditioning units do keep the place very cool, though, and drown out the noise of the city. The beds were extremely comfortable. The TV only got about 5 channels. There was no wastebasket in the room, just a tiny one in the bathroom. And although our beds were made and we got clean towels, there was no sign of maid service. Without a wastebasket, we had piled up a few shopping bags, which we filled with coffee cups, sugar packets, brochures we no longer needed, etc., and those remained on the floor throughout our stay. Our belongings weren't tidied up, nor was the bathroom cleaned. The staff at the front desk were relatively helpful, but acted as though they were in a far fancier establishment. When I inquired about a local restaurant, I was told I'd need to speak to \"the concierge,\" who turned out to be a girl of about 20 who had a notebook with restaurant menus in it. When we arrived, there was a big to-do about \"summoning the bellman\" to take our two tiny roll-on bags upstairs for us. Yet, when I requested a bottle opener, the \"concierge\" said she'd have one delivered to my room, but never did. When I inquired about it the following day, she waid \"Well, we didn't have one, so that's why we didn't bring it.\" This is a hotel that has quite a few pretentions it doesn't live up to. Still, the price was excellent for the neighborhood.", "Date": "August 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good clean rooms, reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2490146", "Content": "I was very happy with my stay at the Belleclaire. The location is great, close to subway and Central Park, and safe.

We were given a different room that had fridge, TV and air conditioning. We only waitied once for the shared bathroom, and the room was very quiet, dark at night, and the bed was good. Both the room and shared bathroom were kept very clean.

It is a fantastic location... 2 blocks from central park and in the middle of a gorgeous upperwest neighborhood which isn't completely populated with other tourists. Nice coffee shops, resteraunts, shops and a generally friendly area.10 minutes from lincoln centre and within walking distance (if your fit!!) to all the touristy things...times square, empire state etc. If you want a room which is adequate with tv, phone, bath, fridge nice comfy big bed then this is a good choice. If you are used to a 4star hotel as one reviewer felt the need to brag about then BOOK ONE!! you will not get the opulent room furniture and other fancy details that you get for paying \u00c2\u00a3150 per room in upmarket hotel but what you will get is good value for money.

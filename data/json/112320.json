We were very impressed and booked for 2 nights at the end of our holiday.Our first stay was a back room which was a nice size and quiet. This was a special occasion which we mentioned when booking online and a bottle of champagne awaited us on arrival. The breakfast on each floor is simple but nice. The staff are friendly and helpful.The complimentary glass of wine in the cosy hotel bar is a nice touch. We ate once in the restaurant and it was excellent.Our second stay was a suite situated at the front of the hotel overlooking the main street.

We had two rooms, my husband and I in a Cozy Double and our friends in a room with two twins. I had read all the reviews on this site so I was prepared for noise at night. However, our rooms faced the back alley and other than normal night city noise we all slept well. We found the beds comfortable. I will agree with other reviewers that our bathroom in the Cozy Double room was very small and a person larger than myself would have trouble using the toilet and perhaps shower. Our friends in the twin room had a much larger bathroom so I have to think if you request a bigger bathroom the staff would be accomodating. Breakfast in the morning was great, muffins, scones, pastries, fruit, coffee, tea and OJ---and all right outside your room!The free wine in the restaurant was such a nice touch and we sat talking at the bar for a long time and no one seemed to mind. We ended up eating at Fino and it was delicious. The front desk attendant was very helpful and got us ice several times.

If you're on the back or the alley, the bar in the back releases a steady stream of loud, inebriated people until about 2:30 am, and then the garbage truck will wake you up at 4:30 am.)

When we checked in we were given a king size sunny corner bedroom with two bay windows that faced Post Street. The side windows faced an apartment building. We had two club chairs, fridge and private bathroom with a shower. It was clean and neat and exactly as advertised. Shortly after we dropped our bags in the room there was a knock on the door and a maid appeared with a small vase of flowers. Plus # 1. The next was a note telling the guests of the Andrews that you were welcome to come to the lovely first floor restaurant every night of our stay for a free glass of wine. Plus #2.The refridgerator in the room was stocked with complimentary beverages (non alchoholic), which when used was replaced the next day. Plus #3. And the last nice plus was the lovely continental breakfast that was set out each morning on each floor between 7 and 9:30 AM. You simply went outside, grapped a tray and filled it up with fruit, muffins, coffee and juice. The staff were all pleasant, and in one particular case went over and beyond the cause of helpful, but I'm getting ahead of myself.Every hotel has its issues. Be aware that this is a European style hotel. Built before the 1906 quake, it is well worn, but obviously well cared for. The antique elevator was small. Our bathroom shower was probably two feet by two feet. However, the water was hot and the towels could be replaced as little or often as you asked. They supplied lovely shampoo, etc. and replaced as necessary. I don't believe we received that from a major hotel in Vegas. But again I digress, The second problem stems simply from the hotel's age. It seemed to have very little sound proofing. The curved glass windows are single paned and the walls are thin. We woke up every morning to the daily garbage pick-up and street cleaning. It seemed that every street noise was magnified straight into our room. On our first night in the hotel there was a very loud party coming from either the street or the apartment building next door. I awoke with a start to karakoke voice minicking Elivis singing Neil Diamond. To be fair my husband didn't think the singing was so awful, however we each agreeded it terribly was loud. I called the front desk. The clerk asked which room we were in and then said hang on a minute. The phone was placed down and minute later he came back with an apology that there was a loud drunken party going on and that was the last song. Sure enough, the singing ended and back to sleep we went. I felt very grateful at that moment. That was the only problem we encountered during our stay, other than the normal city noises.This hotel will appeal to those who prefer a smaller, older, more intimate hotel over the large, sterile, hotel chains that infest the downtowns of most US cities.

The hotel was a perfect launching off point for our adventures in San Francisco. The old world style and charm of the hotel made it a great place for a romantic long weekend. The staff was professional, the room very comfortable despite its modest size, and the location excellent. Having read other TripAdvisor reviews, we booked a Comfy Queen and requested an upper-level room if possible. Upon arrival, we were given room 709, back and away from the elevator on the hotel's top floor. It was nicely but simply decorated, with a TV monitor and DVD player in the room. The bed was on the soft side but quite comfortable. There was a small desk and dresser, and a nice leather chair in the corner. If we had wanted to, it would have been a nice quiet spot to spend a little time reading or something.The bathroom was among the more spacious in the hotel, I'm assuming, as others have commented on their tiny size. Ours was actually quite large, with a full bath and shower as well as a separate alcove for toilet, and enough space so both of us could get ready at the same time (although we had to swap space in front of the mirror/sink). The street noise was modest for a hotel in the downtown area of a major city. I slept with ear plugs, as I usually do when I travel, and had slept like a dream. My wife had no problems without her ear plugs, and she is a fairly light sleeper. Continental breakfast will not satisfy those who insist on Americanized breakfast rooms or expect a big meal, but we very much enjoyed the assortment of muffins, croissants, butter and jam, fresh fruit, coffee, and freshly squeezed orange juice. It was nice to have trays set out to carry food back to our room. One nice touch was the captain's chairs folded and waiting in our closet--extra seating on the fly!We enjoyed a complementary glass of wine in Fino, the bar/restaurant in the lobby, one evening. We did not dine there but the food looked and smelled great. We also appreciated having water, tea, and coffee available in the lobby at all times.

Convenient to virtually everything, including public transport (cable cars, MUNI, BART station, etc.). The Thai restaurant across the street (Ar Roi) is also quite good, by the way!

The Italian restaurant in the lobby smelled fantastic and has free wine tastings in the evenings (though we never had the chance to go). There is $25 all-day parking behind the hotel that is manned during the daytime, and if you've got a room in the back, you can at least keep an eye on your car at night. It felt fairly safe and secure. There is also a small night club directly behind the hotel in the parking area, which gets only a little noisy at nights, but not annoyingly so. I actually could not hear the music inside at all from my room -- just the occasional drunk in the parking lot. The rooms got a little stuffy with the windows closed, but they do open (1 in room, 1 in bathroom), which allows for good ventilation. There is a heater, but no A/C or fan. The cont. breakfast is small, but tasty. It is served on a table in the hallways of every floor, so if you run out of something on your floor, you can call the front desk or simply go to the next floor. The staff were very courteous and helpful when I stayed there. The rooms are small. And I mean, small. I don't have the official statistics, but we did some comparison measuring at home and came up with about 120-130'sq including a tiny bathroom. We had a room w/ 1 Queen, which was a big enough bed, and very comfortable, but it was so small we couldn't fit a rollaway (which are available, leading me to believe there are larger rooms available).

Stayed Saturday  Sunday night. Couldn't find very much reasonably priced on the net. Everything seemed overly exorbitant, and anything in the lower price bracket (prefer to save my money for shopping) showed up as no vacancy on the many hotel booking services I tried. Consequently I rang the hotel (always to be recommended) to find they had one vacancy. $119 for Saturday night, $109 for Sunday, for a small room with a double bed. I found the room small but clean, and as it was on the 4th floor, and near the rear, minimal noise, except for the pigeons (but they too sleep). Breakfast was just outside the door. It starts at 7, so I'd advise gettimg out earlier, grabbing the good pastries (really liked the one with the apple filling), and relaxing in bed with the above, over the squeezed orange juice and coffee. The first day, the juice was all gone, so I called the front for a refill (0.5litre jug is placed on the self serve trolley in the hall outside the rooms on each floor). I also asked for more pastries, but told there were on more, and was advised to check other floors - hence my recommendation to get up early.The free wine is between 5 and 6:30 in the neighbouring FINO restaurant. The food smells good, but I cancelled my booking after showing up 5 minutes late for the wine, and being refused, even though I had given a healthy tip the previous day. It's another story, I suppose, and I was late. Two guys in the restaurant were very helpful on the first day. The guy who refused the wine on the second day should perhaps quit working in the hospitality industry. Of course, this probably has nothing to do with the hotel per se.Anyway, good value, great location, friendly people, so Im going back again for a longer stay next week - seems like a bargain - a queen size for $99 per night.

Just stayed at this Joie de Vivre line boutique hotel for 2 nights and we loved it! My husband had business in the East Bay and UCSF however, we LOVE coming to SF and enjoy staying in boutique hotels in the city. The Andrews was definitely a true gem. Our room was a king size bedroom...I think they call it the Cozy King on their website. And cozy certainly defines it. The bed  pillows were VERY comfortable. We are always prepared for the smaller sized rooms when visiting SF, especially in the boutique hotels. Anyone that complains about the size of these types of hotels definitely needs to read up on boutique hotels or stay at the larger chains (even the W has smaller rooms for an upscale hotel-it IS San Francisco after all and personally, we'd much rather spend our time IN the city exploring than hanging out in a bedroom!). We were on the 2nd floor and the elevator did not fail us once. We were able to valet the car however, word to the wise, always call for your car at least 15 minutes before you need it! The receptionist was very very friendly and gave us all the information we needed! The Happy Hour in the adjacent Fino Restaurant is from 5-6:30pm and you receive one complimentary glass of wine. The bartenders both nights were super friendly however, Britney was a STAND OUT! She was very open to chatting with us about local hangouts, etc. We went to a Giants game (that stadium is AMAZING!) and not being familiar with that part of the city, we started asking away. She told us about great little joint called O'Neils right outside the stadium near Chophouse (her other job) and we even saw her in there after the game. As a side note to visitors: We have our SF favorites of course and I would recommend House of Nanking on Kearny for THE BEST Chinese food in the city (don't order from the menu...just set it down and wait. Tell him what you like and how hungry you are and you'll be in heaven soon! PS: not for the claustrophobic. You may sit just as close to your unknown dining neighbor as if you were on the city bus!) If you are a micro-brew beer connoisseur, you MUST go to the Toronado Room in Lower Haight-All kinds of local, CA and northwest local brews in addition to a few micros outside the west coast and the Pabst, Bud, etc. options if you MUST have it. Our friends took us to Kate's Kitchen for breakfast one day (also in Lower Haight) and it was excellent! Tons of food-not a single of us could finish and no one spent more than $10/person!We've been to SF many many times, plan on visiting many many more and ALWAYS enjoy ourselves. The Andrews was really a great experience-we couldn't have asked for a better place for a couple nights of fun w/ friends and exploring. And the price can't be beat for the accommodations  location (for the shopaholics-the Andrews Hotel is minutes, literally a few blocks, from Union Square and shopping galore!

Well, in fairness, the room did have two windows, both of which looked out into the interior ventilation shaft of the building, up which we got an unpleasant whiff of cigarette smoke periodically throughout the day, despite being 6 floors up!! The room was very old fashioned with a small uncomfortable bed, the middle of which we both rolled into and met on a nightly basis! We also found it extremely noisy with very thin walls and doors - we could hear our neighbour brushing his teeth each night - ear plugs we found were a must.The breakfast was no more than fruit and croissants and I found it a little disturbing meeting the lady next door in her nightie every morning getting her share! The bar was okay, a nice touch offering a glass of complimentary wine each evening. However, one evening we retired to the hotel for a drink in the bar at around 10pm only to be told that it was shut and even as residents we could not get a drink!!On the plus side, the location of the Andrews is good and the laundry next door but one was faultless!", "Date": "Aug 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR975196639", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AndW"}, {"Content": "The Andrews is excellent My wife and i stayed at the Andrews Hotel for four nights in August, and it was terrific - just as it was when we stayed there during our honeymoon six years ago.Yes, it's small, and yes, the bathrooms are cramped.

He gave us a recommendation fort the best Chinese food my wife and I have ever had. The Hotel is also in an ideal location, very close to Chinatown, Union Square, Nob Hill, and public transportation which can get you to almost any section of the city with 5-10 minutes.

And it also says that if anything runs out to call the front desk and they will replenish it. We tried to get breakfast at 8:00am and all that was left was coffee.

From there, we rode the Richmond or Pittsburgh-Baypoint bound BART train (about a 15 min ride) to the Powell St. stop and got off. The hotel was just a few blocks away.In addition to being close to BART stations, the hotel is ideally located in SF's theatre district. We were able to walk to all of the places we wanted to see: Chinatown (2 blocks), Nob Hill (about 4 blocks), Fisherman's Wharf(~1 mi), Ghiradelli Square (~.5 mi), museums (~7 blocks). Shopping is just the next block over. The only site that was a trouble to get to was the Golden Gate, which is a good 2 to 2.5 miles away. If you are not at all of fan of walking, take the cable cars. The hotel is right next to the line.The Andrews itself turned out to be everything we had read about in the reviews. We got the best deal on our Corner King room through its website (-------). The room was extremely clean and offered a spacious closet, tv, bathroom with a stall shower (if you want a bath with tub, ask for a Comfy queen room instead), ceiling fan and two large windows for sunlight and a breeze. There was noise in the evenings from the street below (particularly from the parking lot in the back), but that is expected of a city, and the noise was tolerable. I can only recall hearing one firetruck at night during our three-day stay - I didn't feel that they were a grave problem, though perhaps we may have lucked out. The area around the hotel is quite safe and we felt quite comfortable walking out at night. Both the front-desk staff and cleaning staff were extremely friendly and helpful, giving us tips on getting around the city and even fixing our swipe key when it refused to unlock our room door. The morning continental breakfast was substantial and lovely as was the tea/coffee reception in the lobby. In the afternoons, they left out fresh fruit in the hallways. And we did give the FINO restaurant a try - we were thoroughly impressed by its dishes.Overall, I would highly recommend the Andrews Hotel.

Pastel colors and floral motifs dominated, from the beautiful bed comforter to the full-length curtains, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The continental breakfast laid out in the hall each morning was more than ample for me (coffee, tea, juice, and a basket of baked goods), and the complimentary glass of wine each evening was a bonus.

From the airport, you can take Bart to Powell Street; from there it's a (slightly uphill) ten-minute walk past Union Square to the Andrews, or a three-minute cab ride. One note: The bathroom in my room was fine for me but was exactly the same size as the closet--about three feet wide--and would not have accommodated a large person.

We rented a car in oakland because we were traveling up to Napa - next time we'll rent in the city.We would definatly stay here again - what made this place stand out was CUSTOMER SERVICE - we have traveled all over the worls and have never had the attention nor the personal care as we did here at the Andrews.Enjoy", "Date": "Jun 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR362650320", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "xm"}, {"Content": "An excellent budget hotel of rare character. I just came back from San Francisco and feel compelled to write a review of this wonderful hotel. Taking price into the equation, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Just a few points here: 1) The location is fantastic. 2) The rooms are both characterful - something very rare in hotels in this price range these days - and well provisioned. 3) The staff know the city backwards, are very professional, and even at busy times, were always ready to help. 4) Breakfast is included - again something that is rare in American hotels in this price range - and a basket of fruit is available on each floor throughout the day.

Our room (two twin beds) was charming, small, but more than adequate with a small sitting area and interesting view looking north toward Nob Hill. The bathroom was clean and convenient, not renovated but fully serviceable and quaint. Breakfast was sumptious, with real dairy for the coffee, fresh fruit and pastries and real butter. The staff, especially Oscar, were helpful, friendly and very knowledgeable about transportation and locations. We had a car (+$25 for parking in a 24-hour attended lot), and Oscar and staff were able to give us easy, accurate driving instructions. The charm of the hotel, the grace of the staff, and the superb location near theatres, cable car, and Muni bus across the street make this MY hotel in San Francisco.

I spent 2 weeks there while taking a class.Everything everyone has said in the other reviews is true. It's a pleasant little hotel. The location is close to everything. The staff is nice. The morning buffet was very good and on each floor. The rooms are small but are comfortable.I prefer to be out and about in SF, so the room was fine.The other guests seem to like the place too.The price is a great deal for what you get.It's not a Holiday Inn, so if you have kids and need a pool for them, this is not your hotel.If you're a couple of grownups it's a hotel for you.", "Date": "Apr 5, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR315538168", "Ratings":

I have stayed here a few times (not through choice as the company put us here) and it is without a doubt the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in and I have been all over the world and stayed in some pretty bad places.The staff are incompetent and do not care at all about the customers, the rooms are disgusting, old and not cleaned well. A friend had a remote control made into his bed and mine had damp sheets with cigarette burns in it.There is a train that passes through the night and blares it's horn, very annoying. I could go on and on but I just want to warn you that this place is disgusting and should be avoided at all costs.

When we went to the room there was a whole row of similar rooms all ready with open windows, no cleaning cart in sight, and inside no sign of recent cleaning such as a wet tub or sink. (Yes, no interior corridors, makes one wonder about security). In addition we asked for a quiet room and were given a room right behind the restaurant with its groaning a/c system.

My mother and I stayed here for one night before we moved on to another hotel in New Orleans. Our plane arrived at 12:30am. The personnel were pleasant and had no problems with our late check-in. But when we arrived at the airport and called them to pick us up, the lady answering the phone mumbled so much I couldn't understand her. We waited and waited and finally were told by a taxi driver to catch the hotel's shuttle in the transportation area (different than where the cabs pick up). The shuttle driver was pleasant though. The concierge was also pleasant on check-in but for two women travelling alone - they could have put us in a safer room! We were put all the way around the back side of the hotel up on the 4th floor. We had to walk through two dark alley ways and wait in a dark elevator shaft area. Once settled in, we got to listen to a drug deal on the balcony outside our room - we barracaded the door with the table and chair! We also got to listen to a horn-happy train several times that night - it was like something out of that movie My Cousin Vinny! The rooms were okay, but they were old and dirty looking. They have a sign in the lobby that says Please excuse our dust, we are still recovering from Hurricane Katrina - 19 months later at the airport? Sounds like an excuse to lighten the housekeeping chores. If you stay here - ask for a room close to the lobby. Also, the cab they called to take us to New Orleans took Airport Hwy instead of Hwy 10 - taking longer and costing more! Be sure to tell them to take Hwy 10.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR139316050", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lovethatcity"}, {"Content": "Worst hotel of my vacation This is the worst Best Western I've ever stayed. The bathroom door would not close all the way. It may have been swollen due to humidity. I don't know. I just know it would not fit into the door frame to close. Both bedspreads were stained on the white underside. I couldn't tell if the colored outside was stained. But the whole room seemed very dirty. The writing table was sticky. The writing chairs were rickety and will probably soon collapse. We were on the third floor, and the ice machine was on the first floor. It did not work. I had to go to another wing's ice machine.

However, because the room faces the airport parking lot, you can really hear the airplanes that fly overhead, esp in the still of the night. Also, road traffic didn't die down till about 1 a.m. The night of my stay, I turned on the heater because it was in the mid-40s. It was hard to regulate the heat, and the room warmed up too quickly and gave out a sharp odor which lasted a long time. This probably wouldn't be a problem if your stay takes place when the weather is much warmer. Quality of bathroom: average Quality of staff: average Security: average for both hotel and room Meals: Denny's is right next door. Service at Denny's was horrible because of 2 new staff in training -- I had to wait about 2 hrs before my dinner arrived.

My family and I stayed at the Best Western New Orleans Inn At the Airport from Nov 17-20 as it was close to the venue for a conference we were attending in Destrehan. The hotel is located just across the MSY airport and the hotel provided complimentary transport to and from the airport. Being a budget hotel, it was nothing fancy but well-appointed with all the necessary amenities including a gym and a swimming pool. Too bad it wasn't a heated one but the hotel never claimed on its website that it was heated so we could accept that. The room we stayed in was really nice and clean and the bathroom was brightly lit. Adjoining the hotel is Denny's and it was really convenient for our meals. The hotel serves complimentary continental breakfast in Denny's. I find that I enjoyed my stay here more than my stay at Sheraton New Orleans where we stayed in from Nov 20-24. (Refer to my review on Sheraton). After the conference was over, we thought of staying closer to the French Quarter so we moved to Sheraton for the rest of our stay in New Orleans. On hindsight, I found that I was more satisfied with my stay in BW. My family and I had a really good and enjoyable time in New Orleans. We would love to come back. And we'll definitely stay at BW N.

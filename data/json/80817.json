We were booked to stay here for four days, but ended up staying only one night. Like all Kimpton properties, they have a great pet policy and the price (under $100) was very reasonable. However, we were put in a really dingy room with horrible lighting on the ninth floor.... nothing like the sleek, modern rooms shown on the website. It had that distinct gummy-paint-won't-dry feeling that reminds one of undergraduate apartments. We were there with our dog and found that downtown San Francisco is just not a very easy place to stay with a dog, so we moved out to a suburban hotel. Valet parking was expensive and a hassle, and it's important to note that this was a hangout for GenX types. The rickety elevator and very narrow halls made me think that this would be a deathtrap in a fire.

I believe that some or all of the smoking rooms have not yet been renovated so they can be a disappointment. Once we switched I was thoroughly happy though. The bathroom was small, and the nightstands  dresser could be updated a little, but the rest of the decor in the room made up for it. The valet service was a little expensive @ $25 a night, but hey, it's San Fran. The staff was so incredibly nice  willing to make our stay as wonderful as possible. The hotel is within walking distance of many things, but you will need to either take the trolley car or a rental car unless you want to walk some very steep hills to get to your destination.

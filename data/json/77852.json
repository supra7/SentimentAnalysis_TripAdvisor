It is no a 5 star accommodation but it is comfortable and clean. I stayed on two different floors and did not have the same experience that other reviewers have reported. The second time I was fortunate to get a room on the 12th floor with a view of the Hollywood sign. The hotel location has the advantage of being opposite a Metro station (Wilshire/Normandie) which is on the purple line and with only one change you can be in the Hollywood area in a reasonable time. The front desk staff were very pleasant , two of the staff namely Cade and Brendon were very helpful and as I arrived on an early flight from Australia they made every effort to ensure that I had a check-in before the usual 3pm. I would certainly consider staying here again.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe website is very misleading.\u201d", "Author": "zyfzkO", "ReviewID": "UR126606056", "Content": "I booked the hotel under a friends recommendation, but after reading one of the reviews after our stay, I think he might have recommended The Hotel Whilshire. If you take public transport, ie train, you will need to change three lines and take about one hour to get there from LAX airport. Don't do it if your plane arrives late at night and if it is your first time in LA. We took the train and bus option, and due to a delayed flight, we arrived at LAX at night. the trip planner I have prepared instructed us to change to a local bus at Vermont train station. Well, shall I say -It was the dirties, most offputting train station I have ever been to. there is no light in the lift and you could smell urine. I didn't feel save at all. Desperate to get onto a bus, at least there will be lights and a nus driver, we boarded the local bus 206, it took us along Normandie road, there were only two female passengers boarded the bus throughout our ride, and that was the only time I felt saver. The hotel is in the middle of the korean town, if you are comfortable to explore the suburb at night, you will find some decent korean restaurants and supermarket, some restaurants open for 24 hours. Now, the hotel. When I heard the good review from a frequent traveller friend of mine, I went onto their website and checke out the rate. It is about 130 aussie a night. With the glamorous photos and intro they had on their website, I thought, I have just found a gem in LA to stay. Well, not so soon..... When I got to the hotel, I thougt the lobby on their website seems grander. I thought I went to the wrong hotel until the front desk assured me that they can find my booking. The room we stayed in is on the 11th floor, the lift took us up is quite old. We can definately smell cigarette odour in our room even though it states as a non smoking room. We can see hollywood sign from our window, that was a small excitment. The furniture are out dated, but the room is clean. Only complain is the aircon. The is very noisy when you turn it on.

The rooms are filthy and severely outdated. The carpet is coming up all over the room. The curtains are heavy, dank, musty and filthy. The housekeeping was basic at best. The towels in the bathroom are barely larger than hand towels and are wafer thin - as are the walls. A upgrade/refresh would be nice. The lobby has been refreshed, now it is time to tackle the rooms.The hotel is in a great location between downtown and West Hollywood, so why not? The staff were, for the most part, pleasant. The valet guys are a bit pushy but they probably earn most of their income on tips, wait, then maybe they could be less pushy and nicer? Oh yeah, the \"Hollywood sign\" view is not exactly that. It is a view of a high-rise apartment and if you look closely, off in the distance you can see the sign. Don't spend the extra $10-15 a night for this like I foolishly did.

However, once you get onto 3rd floors and higher, it's very apparent that the upkeep of hotel has been very poor. The first room I stayed at had the following problems: -AC unit was blowing out cigarette odor despite being a non-smoking room -Tile in bathroom was cracked and degrading -Carpet in room was stained in several areas -Free wi-fi was extremely slow -TV was an CRT unit that had very poor picture quality and limited channel selection. -Considerable street noise. After being requested to be relocated to a second room, the following problems were noticed: -AC unit was not blowing out cigarette odor BUT it was not able to cool the room either. -Tile in bathroom floor was stilling broken in several areas. -Carpet in the room was still stained in several areas with about six 6\" black stains. -Free wi-fi was again very slow...wasn't sure if Google would even load. -TV was again an old CRT unit with same issues. -Considerable street noise. In addition to this, the gym offered on the 11th floor was practically falling apart and was not opened at its posted time. The 5-7PM happy hour selection (both free food and half price menu selection) was very limited. It is right next to a metro stop but being located in LA, there are plenty of metro rail and bus stops all over the city and most only being 5-10 minutes walk away. Had they offered other incentives, such as 3 pieces of free laundry, complementary dinners and/or drinks, or other incentives...this would have made them more competitive against other hotels and motels. So the take-away from this is: Only use this hotel when you can't find any other hotels or even motels to stay at, which should be very tough situation to get into. If I had a chance to do this again, I would have chosen a hotel with loyalty programs like Hilton or Holiday Inn chains.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad!\u201d", "Author": "AlfSue", "ReviewID": "UR125691127", "Content": "Stayed here from Feb 28, 2012 to March 2, 2012 for business and found it to be ok.

If you spend a few awake hours per day in the room as I did, then I would not stay here. I observed all of the following: Carpet and ottoman was very worn and had some pretty big, dark stains in many places. There was NO CABLE TV, only a few basic channels on an old Zenith TV....No CNBC no business network, not much of anything! The bathroom faucet leaked, and in the sink and shower the water would get only warm, not hot. It was difficult to adjust the room temperature as there was no ac / heat choice. It had only on or off, and hi / low, and put out slight heat in the AM hours and cool air in the pm hours, not able to adjust. The bath towels were ridiculously small, barely bigger than hand towels, and thin material. The bathroom was tiny and very cramped. There was no telephone book for yellow page browsing, and I could not call the front desk because the phone menu paper was missing from the face of the phone which had several buttons, but did not know which one was which due to missing face. The full ceiling to floor windows afforded a nice view, but because that side was all window it was very loud with outside noise.

The person I was with who had a separate room, and upon his check-in, he found the room still occupied with others' property, and it had not been cleaned. He had to get a different room. (Note: Since the TV checkout would not work I checked out at the desk and the person next to me who just checked in had the same complaint). The desk lady was very rude to her as well. To top it all off on checkout day the buffet breakfast cost $23 dollars for one. It was an okay breakfast, but I've had much better breakfast buffets that were complimentary at Best Westerns.

From the outside, the Wilshire Hotel appeared like any typical hotel: located on a busy street, valet parking (not free), bland looking building, etc. The lobby was welcoming. It had a well sized bar area with flat screen TVs which had on different games. There was also another coffee bar that served coffee and tea and breakfast goods. Overall, when you took it all in, it felt as if this was a pretty fancy hotel. However, I was disappointed when I opened the door to room #340. The room completely threw me off! The light in the corridor didn't work. The carpet was incredibly dirty. After fidgeting around with the old fashion circular thermostat, we finally got it to work: on or off. Even though it was set to be 70 degrees, it just kept on getting hotter and hotter. (YIKES!) The restroom was compact, which was fine. But the towels weren't clean very well. In addition, the water pressure for the shower was pretty weak and the water wasn't as hot as I liked it. (I like it hot!)

So, hotel pickings were slim. My friend found this hotel on one of the travel websites and the pictures of the hotel's lobby and rooms were actually quite nice so we chose to stay there based on the price and the pictures. Well, the hotel is in Korea town, its lobby is quite photogenic and I think they probably photographed one of their remodeled rooms which we obviously didn't get to see. We were situated on the 12th floor and once we walked into our room we realized it was a little warm. We just assumed the high temperature was due to the curtains having been open all day and the ac being shut off. So, we turned it down and waited for it to cool. By the time we realized it wasn't happening we'd already unpacked and had begun getting ready for dinner. So we decided to give it the night and would ask for another room in the morning if the situation didn't improve. While we were on our way out the next morning, we asked that someone be sent to our room to check on the ac. When we returned SEVERAL hours later, we realized it was still quite warm so we called the front desk and no they hadn't come so we waited patiently for the technician to arrive. Once he did and tinkered around the unit for a bit he said \"it's better, but it's still not good\" so he put in a request for another room. They were nice enough to put us in another room just a few doors down so we didn't have to repack all of our belongings to move to another floor. Unfortunately, the AC in room number two really wasn't any better and we spent the remainder of the weekend fanning ourselves as we applied our makeup. I'm not sure if the problem is on the 12th floor or if it's in the entire hotel, but when you can't open the windows in the room the AC really needs to work. The room itself wasn't dirty, but it didn't feel clean and the comforters looked like they'd never been washed, EVER. Of course, we threw all that stuff off the beds anyway. Oh, and did I mention there's no fridge? A warm room without cold water is a bad combination. Just in case you're wondering, no I don't plan on staying here again & you probably shouldn't either.

It must be said: our previous hotels were luxuory hotels and awesome. We did expect the worst of Wilshire knowing all reviews of tripadvisor.com Our arrival was ok, a pleasant woman helped us friendly and effective. The room was outdated, but was expected. We did try to contact frontdesk to ask if a renovated room was applicable. A grumpy man told us the hotel did not have any renovated rooms and hung up! 15 mins later we had some trouble with WiFi, called the frontdesk again for some instructions \"WiFi is working ok, probably your settings\" the same grumpy man even more rude.Hardly half an hour later we discovered the toilet wasn't draining it was even flooding and called frontdesk again. Grumpy man sighed, didn't believe me and after another explanation he'd sent an engineer right away. Half hr later engineer didn't show up and called again. I don't mind waiting if I know I have to wait. 20 mins later still no engineer.. it took almost 1,5h for an 'engineer' to show up and fix the toilet. Since it was flooded a cleaninglady would be sent. Went across the street for internet cafe since WiFi still not ok, no stabile connection. Returning after an hour, the bathroom was not cleaned. so I went to look for a cleaning lady myself.. frontdesk seemed not reliable! This was just the 1st day! At night the rooms were very cold, due to a draft: lower windowglass could be moved 1/4\" first 3 nights were cold but ok. Last night was worst: we had to wake up @ 5am to return to the airport. @ midnight I was awaken by heavily dripping on my head! A huge leakage just above my bed.. a broken waterpipe or maybe a broken sewer??? Called frontdesk again: told about leakage and was put in hold! then connection was broken!!! called 'emergency' got same grumpy man explained the situation again and I was really not satisfactory with the service. We did get another room, same floor other wing: key didn't work: lock was broken :-(. We didn't care just wanted to sleep! As a gesture we did get a refund off 50% of parking fee, so finally a small sign of service. Unluckily we could sleep because of many yelling, shouting and knocking Koreamen @ 2am!! After a 3rd call to frontdesk finally security came. And @3:30am the korean next to our room decided to take a noisy bath with hard singing. As a gesture we did get a refund of the remaining valit parking fee. But that couldn't really compensate the lack of sleep and frustration. Check out was done by a young woman which was very friendly again. Summarized: + female staff is friendly and efficient - male staff is very grumpy and frustrating - appearantly renovated rooms do not exist. - toilet wasn't working properly - nights were cold - a leakage just above the headside of the bed - very noisy Korean men All of the above should not be affected by being an outdated hotel Would I recommend this hotel: definately NOT Would I ever return: hell no!", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "israel", "Title": "\u201cDecent\u201d", "Author": "mtlv", "ReviewID": "UR94961230", "Content": "Decent place, great location.

It's 2AM and Customer Service at LAX tells me that all hotels are booked. They let me call my boyfriend who said \"give me ten minutes I will find you a hotel.\" Customer Service told me shortly thereafter they didn't have ten minutes and they were closing so then I had to find a pay phone. At this point I was exhausted. Finally my boyfriend gave me the address to Wilshire Hotel. He booked the hotel for July 30-31. Check in time was at 3 PM. The staff was so friendly and understanding of my situation when I arrived at 4:30AM. They found me a room and worked out the financial situation with my boyfriend since he bought the ticket through a third party (Expedia.com). Needless to say, the Wilshire Hotel has the best and most understanding Hotel Staff and Service I have ever experienced. The rooms are in excellent condition. The only reason I gave Wilshire hotel four stars instead of five for location is because it is about 20 minutes away from LAX. It is possible to arrange a shuttle though.

I was a little concerned about this hotel after reading some of the reviews. It was clear that this was a love it or hate it kind of place based on the fact that only part of the hotel is renovated. I booked the 4 day/3 night package via Priceline which included airfare from Florida to LA for just under $600 total. So considering that airfare by itself would have been about that had I booked separately, I basically got the hotel portion of the package for next to nothing. I was still a bit nervous so I sent a message to one of the more positive reviewers and asked if they would mind telling me the room number that they stayed in, which they kindly provided. I then called the hotel and requested that specific room for my reservation. I arrived at the hotel around 1pm after traveling since 5am. The check in was quick and painless with the exception of the room I requested not being available due to the current guest occupying that particular room extending their stay. I was given an identical room on the 11th floor, the only difference being that it was a street facing room as opposed to a rear facing room. The room was great for what I needed it for. The bed, while the comforter seemed a bit outdated, was very comfortable and the sheets were soft. Some people have posted issues with street noise, but I did not have a problem with this the 3 nights I was there. Perhaps because I was on one of the upper floors. The bathroom was small, but clean and included a blow dryer. Some reviewers have mentioned a problem with the hot water running out, but I did not experience this issue. Also, some reviewers have mentioned problems with the room being too hot. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Florida and have a higher tolerance for warm temps, but I found the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temperature to be quite pleasant and only messed with the thermostat once and that was when I first got there. The internet, while free was VERY slow. I was in town to cover the Premiere of the movie Inception for an entertainment blog, so being able to upload pictures was a big deal and I had A LOT of trouble with this. The TV worked fine and had plenty of channels to choose from. I did not rent a car for this trip as the idea of driving in LA freaks me out, so the fact that the Metro was directly across the street was very convenient. It got me into the heart of Hollywood in 20 minutes. There seemed to be plenty of fast food and dining choices around the hotel, but I ended up eating a lot of room service. It was a little inconvenient that they stopped serving at 10pm. Also, the menu in the room is not current. One time I called down to room service and the phone just rang and rang and rang. When I called the front desk to ask if they were open, they said yes, but they were probably just really busy. The lady attempted to transfer me back to room service, but accidently hung up on me. I finally got through after 30 minutes of trying. There is a $30 dollar per day hold that is placed on your card, which may not be a big deal if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using a credit card but could create some issues if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using a debit card. And charges made to room service aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deducted from that hold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is charged separately, which added additional unforeseen charges. Just a heads up for those traveling on a budget. There is a small gift store downstairs that serves a limited selection of snacks and soft drinks and various sundry items, but it is quite expensive, so I would recommend making the 10 minute walk down Wilshire to the CVS and picking up any snack items you might need. Overall, it was a great stay. As long as you know what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting ahead of time and are not expecting more than what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for you should have no problems. Also, I am a female who stayed there alone and felt safe the entire time which counts for a lot in my book. I am returning next month and will definitely stay there again. A quick note about the airport shuttles. DO NOT use Shuttle Express. This is the most unprofessional outfit I have EVER dealt with and they attempted to get me to pay twice. The driver was unbelievably rude and insulting after I presented my proof of payment and refused to pay again. This was AFTER I had given him a generous tip.

First, the pros: cheap rate for a hotel within 15 minutes of Downtown and USC; impressive entrance and lobby; friendly car valet service; good front desk staff; business center with free printing of airline boarding passes; lots of Asian and other fast food restaurants just outside the hotel; across from Metro subway station; restaurant and coffee kiosk on property, the latter serving Starbucks; no problem accessing 3G from my room; and hairdryer in bathroom and iron in closet. Second, the cons: stains on carpet; window not well sound insulated; old lamp fixtures; no in-room safe; a/c difficult to regulate; and no bowed curtain rod in shower. So, here's my recommendation about the Wilshire Hotel: if you want to save money in Los Angeles, this is an okay deal. I assume that the quality of room I received was related to my using Hotwire. From other posts about this hotel, it does appear there are better, newly renovated rooms. I don't what the rate for those are, but you should probably check and you still might get a pretty good deal. If you're a business traveler on a budget, I'd recommend a Hampton Inn or a Courtyard, but because neither of those are located in Downtown Los Angeles, you'd have to do more driving than you might like. You'd also be paying a lot more than $59.00 for the standard accomodations that business travelers expect. As I checked out, I noticed a lot of international travelers in the lobby, young and old. It almost felt like a hostel. I'm sure that the low rates appeal to these travelers and that they might not worry about some of the room details that a business traveler would. Finally, I went to Hotwire needing an inexpensive property that was close to Little Tokyo and USC. Hotwire described this unnamed hotel as \"near USC.\" So, I thought for sure that I was getting a great rate at the Radisson Midtown-USC, which is right across the street from the University and is normally way overpriced. I was surprised and disapppointed when I clicked \"select\" and discovered that I was paying for a hotel that really is not \"near USC.\" You always take your chances, I guess, with sites like Hotwire and Priceline. Anyway, to sum up, I didn't mind paying only $59.00 for a room for one night at the Wilshire Hotel.

I immediately even before getting our luggage off the cart went to see the manager. I just told him the truth about the room and we were not going to stay 1 night in that room. The managers name was Keith,and very friendly and helpfull guy. He gave us the keys to another room on the 11th floor and asked my wife and I to see this room. Well what a difffence it was like night and day. The room was brand new,,new carpet, new TV set, nice furnishings.It looked like the room I saw on there website. I think they are going under a big renovation project and is going to take sometime to redo all the rooms. Once we got into our new room we found the staff very friendly all the way from the front desk to the restaraunt to the concierge. The Buffet breakfast was standard, and we did not have lunch there. It was only open for breakfast and lunch. The lobby in the bar had a supper menu. The Hotel itself was just on the edge of downtown area the koreatown district. There was a Dennys, and Macs and Subway and a big Pharmacy store within easy walking distance. The LA Metro system was right across the Street. For 5.00 all day pass made it very easy to go downtown, Hollywood, Universal, all wihtin 15 mins to all locations. Also a great busline brought you downtown very easy. The true bottom line was that this hotel was well worth the money compared to the downtown hotels. We saved over 400.00 compared to the Sheraton or downtown Marriott. The bathrooms were a bit small but who is going to hangout in there bathroom all day,lol the only other small problem was they missed 1 wakeup call and I was up anyways so no damage done. They gave us 2 free coup[ons for the Buffet breakfast. That mistake did not happen again. They also have tours you can book right at the hotel for all kinds of places. and the 55.00 Lincoln towncare ride to LAX was worth every penny compared to the 35.00 Super Shuttle from LAX we took to the hotel.

The metro was also right across the street and was easily to get around with. Just wanted to leave this review as I have seen lots of negative comments and I feel I have left an honest review and would definatly reccommend it. Yeah its a little dated, like not modern or anything, but the decor is still nice and very comfy!There is noise from the traffic as its on a mainstream road but its not really an issue. Also the area is very safe I thought, and there is a really cheap and nice chinese restaurasnt across the street called wasabi i think!I think some people are too fussy, this place is great for the price, and the location is pretty good too.

This turned out to be correct as Hollywood was only a few short Metro stops away. However, thats where the positivety of our stay here ends. The customer service provided by the staff at the front desk was average, the concierge forever seems to be on a break, the bar man in the lobby bar give the impression he'd rather be anywhere but there, which is a shame as the lobby itself was a lot cooler to sit in than the room which was hot & stuffy. Understanding that this hotel was built in the late 70s, I expected it to be old, but not run down & falling to bits. Surely in the 30 years its been there, some sort of minor renovation could've taken place apart from changing the Raddison sign over the a Wilshire Plaza sign. Upon reaching the hallway of our floor, we were greeted with the smell of rotting garbage with take away containers or room service trays outside of a few doors - some of these still sitting there 2 days later! The room itself was tiny, old, dirty , smelt like cigarettes despite the fact it was a non smoking room & needed repairs. The room was so small that we barely had enough room to lay 2 suitcases out. Despite the fact we could hear the air conditioning growling away, we couldn't feel it. The window opened but, like the hallway, the air outside also smelt of rotting garbage. The view was lovely as we could see up to the Hollywood sign but as the room was so tiny, couldn't really sit & enjoy it. When we finally could get hold of a concierge, we asked him to organise transport to the airport for us at a specific time. He called half an hour earlier than we had asked & telling us that we were taking too long & the driver was waiting.

The only dispute I would have to mention would be the night manager - a friend of ours was robbed in las vegas and needed to use the phone line, as we had booked the room through expedia there was no credit card down on the room.. which is quite stupid to be honest but we were not asked.. he needed to call various banks, insurance co etc, and ran up a $258 phone bill in 50 minutes.. the night manager then refused to let us back into our room until it had been paid.. I explained how we needed access into the room to get our keycard to take cash out..but after yelling and being extreamly rude to me personally - when it was not me who ran up the bill - a friend covered the cost. I have never felt so disgusted in the way a manager has spoken to a guest - especially when he should not have opened the phone line up ( under any circumstances) without a credit card.

This hotel is actually in Korea town and about 3 or 4 stops from downtown LA. Definitely NOT walking distance. Convenience wise, ie getting from airport or union station, it's right across the road from the metro station which is only $1.25 and quick, frequent and convenient, and also very safe, at all hours. Also, the 720 rapid transit bus to Santa Monica stops right outside (also stops near Rodeo Drive). My room was clean and spacious, but upon pulling back the bedspread, discovered that the blanket had many cigarette burn-holes in it. I asked for the most quiet room as I have trouble sleeping with traffic noise and found many hotels in America don't have good insulation. I was given a room on the 12th floor, but still had to use ear plugs as it was still noisy. I didn't think to ask for a room change, but upon reading the previous review, would definitely do it next time. I'd suggest if you want to stay here, that you ask for a room at the back of the building AWAY from Wilshire Boulevard as this is a major arterial road. Bathroom was clean and staff were polite and helpful, especially the guys at the concierge desk. Although, they didn't even know that LA has a Visotor Information Centre on Figuroa across from the metro station at 7th (which I found by accident). They weren't all that helpful in regards to some questions about getting around LA, but they tried at least. They have a business centre, but you have to pay and arm and a leg for internet access.

Upon arrival check in was extremely smooth, we were staying on the 8th floor. Got to our room and was pleasantly surprised as it was spacious, bathroom was clean with lots of fresh towels, although a little dated and a refurb wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go a miss. But for the money we had paid we were happy. Unfortunately I did notice a rather large damp patch near the window in the bedroom which I was rather puzzled about but put this to the back on my mind and we went out for the evening. On retiring for the evening, I happened to notice a strange object which appeared to be on the top cover of my sister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed, on closer inspection we discovered it was actually dried on chewing gum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eek! She removed the top cover and we went to sleep. They say these things come in 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and our room was on the front of the hotel, which I have to say didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturb my sister but I found it difficult to sleep and decided that I should speak with reception in the morning. The following day at reception we were quickly asked whether we wished to change rooms, we did, we had a new room on the rear of the property on the 4th floor. Whilst re-packing of suitcases in the 8th floor room, Pedro, one of the maintenance engineer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeared to look at the mysterious leak, this was probably no more than 10 minutes after we had reported the problem. Once settled into our new room we had no further problems, we were very happy and I had no further problems with traffic noise from outside. Try and request a room at the rear is my advice. We found the staff to be pleasant and polite at all times. Breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included within our room rate but there was plenty of choice and should you not wish to go for the buffet options there were plenty of cheaper options you could choose from. Great snack bar in the hotel lobby which we quite often bought our lunch from also gift shop which sold crisps, sweets and cold drinks. Check out the great juice bar Robek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s across the road, made solely of fruit and they last for ages, really, really good. Swimming Pool was lovely, good size, it was never full although had it have been there may have been a requirement for more sun loungers. Water always cold though even when the sun had been on it all day but actually it was quite refreshing to cool yourself down and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that the idea of swimming pools?! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hire a car but had no problem with getting about. As someone else mentions in another review, you have both a metro (Wilshire/Normandie) across the road and a bus stop on either side of the road. The 720 bus takes you all the way to Santa Monica, this takes about \u00c2\u00be of an hour, although there is a 920 which we reckon doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop and so many places along the way and would probably get you there quicker but these are few and fair between. Bus costs you $1.25 single trip. As for the metro, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run all the way to Santa Monica but is really useful for getting to Hollywood, again a single trip would cost you $1.25. As for eats, unless you head downtown I agree with other reviewers apart from fast food places didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be much around the hotel although this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother my sister and I, we generally jumped on the metro or headed off down to Santa Monica on the bus for the evening. Would highly recommend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Time Out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Los Angeles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a guide book this gave us lots of tips on places to visit and places to drink/eat etc. Places that you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily stumble across. We ate well. This was my first trip to LA although my sister had been once before, we thoroughly enjoyed our 8 day stay at the Wilshire Plaza, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to come home and will definitely be visiting LA again and would not hesitate in staying in the Wilshire Plaza again.

I read on a review in October that the sun wasnt on the pool! what do you expect in October!!!!! The breakfast is really good and very cheap. Buffet for 14 dollars and plenty of choice. Really nice waiters and great service. My negatives are that the restaurant does not open in the evening which is a shame and could do well and the gym equipment is very old and the air con doesnt work in there, but that was good for me!!!! The underground metro is accross the road so easy to get to Hollywood, Santa Monica etc etc and only 5 dollars all day travel. There arent really many restaurants close by walking distance to the hotel. Avoid HMS Bounty as they tried to add 15% to our food bill even tho it said would only add for parties of 5 or more.

You would expect that you got a big pizza for that price, but it wasnt even food for one person. But hell, Los Angeles got tons of great restaurants, so why complain ? Youre are not supposed to be in the hotel, when youre on vacation. The brakfast is awesome. Really good food, just too bad we were so hangovered, that we missed it a large ammount of times.

But the rate was great, and I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and give the hotel a try. I have to say that my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised! The hotel DID look like the pictures on expedia, and the staff was very friendly. We even thought that our air conditioner was broken, but it turned out that we did not turn the knob right, but they sent a repairman up with in 10 minutes of us telling them our problem. The room was very nice, and we had a great view. The pool area was very pretty with terraces with flowers on them, but we did not end up swimming because we went to the beach instead. The hallways were clean and smelt fresh, and not like fish and smoke as someone had remarked in a review. We requested a non-smoking room, and we received one. I did not smell ANY smoke throughout the building, not even outside. When we checked in we were even given the choice of which side of the hotel we would like to stay on, either street view, or at the back which was quiet, but not a good view. We chose the street. The area was very nice. On out first night we walked several blocks to Denny's and felt safe. It was quiet and there were only a few people walking around. There were not rats or homeless people laying around that I saw, as someone posted in their review, and yes it is in the middle of \"Korea town\", but It was still a nice area. If you want to see homeless people check out Hollywood blvd. All in all, I had a fantastic time at this hotel, No it was not 5 star, it was not brand new with plasma screen tvs or any other things like that, but it was a nice older hotel with a lot of character. The only complaint we had was the parking. The first night we did not do valet, because we found somewhere to park on the street. The receptionist even told us where we could park on the street, but your car would have to be moved by 8am. So yes it was possible to avoid the $20 a day valet parking, but we did not want to get up at 7:30am every morning to move the car, so we gave in and did valet, which was very nice and convenient. No worries of tickets or damage. If you are going to Los Angeles, you will find that parking, especially downtown is VERY sparse and hard to find, not to mention expensive.

There was also a man behind her that said his roof was also leaking and his a/c also did not work. I was given a room change and 2 comp tickets to the next morning's breakfast buffet. The second room was worse than the first. The a/c also did not work, the ceiling leaked, the phone did not work, the bathroom was infested with mold, there were BULLET HOLES in the window and BLOOD STAINS on the curtains! I again had to walk to the front desk because the phone did not work, and was infuriated when I found the elevators to be out of service! I had to take the STAIRS for SEVEN FLOORS! The manager seemed annoyed and said there's nothing he can do for me... he said it's an \"old building\" and that he had FIFTEEN room changes the night before! He offered me nothing except an attitude and ended the conversation by saying I can pack up and leave if I want and he'd refund the last night! Ontop of that they called that night to ask me to come down and pay the 20 dollar PER NIGHT fee for valet parking... which I absolutley refused to pay. I reset the trip odometer on my rental car and found my suspisions to be true... the mileage went up, gas went down, and I found reciepts for Burger King and Staples stuffed down on the side of my seat for that current day! Of course this was denied up and down and I had to walk away or I would probably be in La County Jail right now. The breakfast buffet was pathetic... free for us with out comp tickets, but it's regularly $13.50! It had average (at best) french toast, watery eggs, bacon, orange juice, and cereal with warm milk. Please do NOT stay at this hotel, I felt bad for every single person walking in the doors while I was there. Feel free to contact me through here or use my screename at yahoo dot com for more information... the videos I cannot post due to there being some profanity, but I'd be willing to email them.

It was my wife's B-day so I took her to L.A. to the Price is Right show. We arrived in L.A. at 11:30pm and were met by the Valet at our car door. After unloading our car we were escorted to our rooms by a bell hop who entered the room before us and unloaded all our things and left. When we entered the room we found out why he was in such a hurry. The bathroom had mold on the caulking all the way around the tub. The carpet was vacuumed from the door to the bed and everything outside of that had about a quarter of an inch of lint and dust on it. The bed shams were torn and the sheets and blankets were nasty. We slept in our cloths!!!! Actually we didn't sleep much because we could hear our neighbors doing the wild thing for about an hour. I asked for a wake for 5:00am and was late because they didn't call until 6:00am. When we went down to the lobby we asked for a map quest to get to CBS and the desk clerk said you don't need one just follow the the crowd and you will get there. My wife actually had to tell him \"now you be a good little boy and go over there and get me a map quest honey\" then he finally did it. Thank god because it was about 10 turns and 12 miles from the hotel we would have never found it. So we went to get our car and the valet said you need $20.00 to get your car back. I asked him why and he showed me a sign about 9\"x9\" hidden behind a podium that read if you only stay for 1 night you have to pay $20.00 to park. Then we knew why the valet had met us at our car so that we had no chance at all to read the stupid sign. When we returned from the studio we had to argue with the valet to be able to park again without having to pay again.

I came back recently (now it's the Wilshire Plaza) because my company booked me a room here for a business venture. I've stayed in 2 star hotels that were better than this place. Out of all the problems, the labor strike and the closed pool were the least of my worries. We arrived at 2pm and the concierge stated that our rooms might not even be ready by 3pm. They lost our reservation forms and we wouldn't have gotten our rooms if we didn't have a copy on hand. The call taxi service that they advertise downstairs wouldn't even bother to come pick us up on 2 occasions, and I was left stranded 3 miles away with no familiarity of the area (i was lucky to catch a bell cab). The wireless internet downstairs was always a gamble and there was absolutely no internet service in my room over the course of my 4 day stay. If you have a room beyond the 10th floor, DO NOT take the middle elevator. It always stops on the 10th floor even if you don't push the button. On top of that, it will sit there for 5 minutes even if you hold down the close door button. The workout room is small and can really only service 2 people (prepare for a long wait if you see more than 2 people in there). The complimentary fruit and muffin breakfast on the 11th floor is okay, but the fruit tasted like the buyer didn't know how to tell if it was ripe or in season. The hotel has some pros--cleaning service is on point and rooms appeared clean and fresh every time we returned to our rooms. The concierge downstairs seem to cater to guests well. It's located in Koreatown, possibly one of LA's largest drinking and nightlife grounds outside of Hollywood. It's close to a chain of convenient banks, a 24/7 internet cafe (thank God), a really great Korean restaurant next door, and the Normandie/Wilshire Metro stop right across the street.

Ours was missing the carafe and filter basket. A call to the front desk brought a fellow bearing coffee. I explained that I had coffee, but needed a carafe and basket. He returned with a carafe. I still needed the basket. He came back again with two baskets, neither of which fit, and no carafe. I told him to forget it and went to bed. He returned again with a replacement coffee makers. Which had the wrong-size carafe, meaning that unless I had modified the basket, it would not ever ever drip coffee into the carafe. At least he tried. Meanwhile, in the other room, our kids needed extra blankets. They called housekeeping twice, and blankets never arrived. They went to the front desk to request blankets. They tried to return to their rooms using the elevator, but since it was feeling petulant and didn't want to come, they tried the stairwell, but were locked out of the elite 10th floor, so had to catch the third elevator on another floor in order to get back to their rooms.

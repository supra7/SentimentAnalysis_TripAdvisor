We first reserved a \"marina-view room,\" but upon checking in discovered that while we could see the marina at an angle fro our window, the room was really on the front entranceway (there were also street-side rooms). When we complained, the receptionist quickly put is in a pricier \"harbor-view\" room at no extra cost. The room was comfortable, and the bathroom modern and large. In-room Wi-Fi was fine, though if one wanted to use the \"business center\" PC off the lobby, they would discover that the computer was out of service and had been for at least a couple of days (an error message saying a virus proteciton was out of date appeared on the screen). One staf member said they didn't know that they were going to do with the computer. Maybe call a tech? Two other small \"problems\": -the room look out on a public walkway that goes along a long stretch of the harbor, so you need to be aware that you may have people walking outside your room at almost any time. -the card entry machines use to activate the gate to the parking area (apparently no attendant on duty, but there was barbed wire on the fence where there wasn't water) were built far enough from the entryway that it was very awkward to position one's car to be close enough to use one's room key for the machine and also be able to drive through the gate without hitting a post. The machine at the entrance to the lot sometimes would not work during rain. Maintenance! The Thursday night reception had few people the night we were there, even though it featured decent snacks and wine. This was in February, not high season. A decent Continental breakfast is included. There is no restaurant for dinner, but there are several places within easy walking distance. The hotel gives coupons good for discount at some pricier eateries, such as Ruth's Chris. The free shuttle bus can take you to several places, but you need to be sure when it's on a set schedule and when it's on-call. During the set schedule periods you may have a long wait for the next run. All in all, a peaceful place to stay, and close enough to attractions to be convenient.

Our bed was unbelievably comfortable and helped make our stay even more relaxing. We enjoyed our breakfast buffet meals while sitting in the quiet courtyard. The staff members were pleasant and helpful. Fell's Point was great. The hotel is in an excellent location - close to the restaurants, pubs, and water taxi (all within walking distance) but off on it's own quiet stretch. We look forward to our return.

However, we were very disappointed in some of the things during our stay at Henderson's Wharf on April 1st, mainly with service. We arrived on April 1st, the day before our cruise vacation. We paid over $250 for an Inner Harbor room with a harbor view. I booked this room several months in advance and were promised a room on the highest floor possible, facing the water/harbor after requesting this. We were also supposed to get a bottle of wine with our reservation upon arrival. We we arrived we were checked in very hastily by a young man, then given the keys to our room. We never did receive the bottle of wine or anything else. However, we did notice other people receiving wine. We went to our room, but instead of being on the upper floor as requested and promised, it was Room 123 on the first floor. Well, in this room you could hardly see anything of the harbor, or any water. What I did see was iron fence and railings and a lot of joggers running past my window all the time. The room itself was nice, but the carpet in this room had that musty, terrible smell and was worn. Not sure how the other rooms were. The breakfast was good.

The hotel itself is gorgeous and situated right on the harbor for spectacular views and panoramas especially thru the door sized windows. The two large queen sized beds are extremely comfortable and you even get a complimentary bottle of wine to put in your ample sized fridge upon arrival. The service was professional and courteous especially our hostess/manager Lee. The parking is free and so is the succulent continental breakfast that offers only the freshest fruits, bagels and coffee. All of this at a very reasonable price for everything you get.

I waited while my wife returned to the desk and we were only then told to use our room pass key to open the gate to the parking area, something we should have been told initially. Subsequently, we made a few other routine requests but the response was uniformly rather brusque and not as helpful as it could have been. Repeated efforts during out stay to telephone the desk from the room resulted in no answer. Another's guest effort to have the E-mail printer made operative was ignored and he was left waiting at the computer (which I also wanted to use).

I've never had a reason to feel unsafe here; the lobby is always staffed and never seen any weirdo's hanging around, but if you (like me) prefer feeling a little more secure, opt for a water view room or a garden view room instead of the run-of-the-house or street-view which tend to be in the very foremost hallway of the hotel.

But don't let my paranoia turn you off--- actually this is the only first-floor hotel room I've ever been able to get a good night's sleep in! Rooms: the beds are super comfy, plenty of crisp linens and warm duvet. Everything smells and looks super clean. Even the carpet is thick and luxurious. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about the pillows though. Parking: it's in a lot next to the marina across the street. When you arrive, park in the \"Hotel Parking Only\" spots in front of the hotel, get your room key and that will let you in and out of the lot.

The speed in which he had things setup had me a little worried as I have been burnt in the past by mediocre restaurants buying customers through hotel recommendation but in this case I shouldn't have. The shuttle was on time, the restaurant perfect for a romantic dinner and the food was exceptional. All-in-all, a perfect getaway!!!

Hate to say anything negative about the place but I want the review to be complete. The one drawback was the washroom. Trendy bowl sink and fresh flowers. Nice.

Fells Point is a great town to visit and check out all the little shops and make sure to stop at John Steven, Ltd., 1800 Thames St., [--] what a great lunch, the cream crab soup was the best I have ever had.

We talked to others we met during our stay that booked other hotels and they were envious when hearing all the amenities we received included in our price. Parking was free and located in an easily accessible lot right next to the hotel. We stayed in a harbor view room which was nicely appointed and not your typical run of the mill hotel room. The wall facing outside was all brick with an overhead arch surrounding the 3 large windows looking out to the water. We never felt cramped as these are decent sized rooms. There is also a stocked snack and mini-bar if you care to purchase anything. The bathrooms are also large with good water pressure from the large showerhead. Included in the price were robes to use, a bottle of wine of your choosing and a large continental breakfast selection ranging from fruit, cereal, bagels, donuts, juices, milk and coffee. At the time of booking, no King beds were available so we booked two queens. This actually worked out nicely. We happened to book 10/5 thru 10/7 and were able to enjoy the Fell's Point festival as an added bonus. The town is quaint with an historic feel with their cobble stone roads and buildings kept with a \"revolutionary age look\". There are many bars and restaurants in Fell's point and Little Italy section is minutes away by car or 15 - 20 minute walk if its nice outside. Also, the water taxi to Inner harbor is a 5 minute walk from the hotel to take advantage of any shopping or eateries you may want to visit there. It was nice though to get back to Henderson's Wharf at the end of each day to relax in a very comfortable and cozy atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and ready to help with any information or questions you have about the area.

We had nice weather so we ate in the courtyard next to a fountain. They did not skimp on breakfast either, offering things like fresh blackberries and a tasty lemon pound cake. I only noticed two things that could be improved. There is no concierge on duty, so if you need to get tickets to an event, you are going to have to bring a laptop or use the lobby computer. We had to use the one in the lobby. Another guest was using it for an extended time when we tried to get tickets, so the staff was nice enough to let us use one in their office. The second thing I want to note can't really be improved upon, but I mention it if you are concerned with privacy.

Just over two hours away, it's a whole different world!! What a place!! Baltimore is a totally revitalized city---a city where excitement and culture abound---where life is never dull---a place you can visit alone or with your family---and never be bored!! One of the most fascinating areas of Baltimore is Fells Point--a collection of brick row houses on the waterfront, dating back to the 1700's, originally built by sea captains. The cobblestone streets, gourmet restaurants, and interesting shops are a must-see. In the heart of this ecclectic enclave, Henderson's Wharf, at the end of Fell Street, will afford you a lodging experience of unsurpassed quality and comfort. Originally an abandoned tobacco warehouse dating back almost two centuries, this brick structure was lovingly and painstakingly restored----creating magnificent condominiums on the upper floors, and a first-rate hotel located on the ground floor. Your room affords a great water view, complete with boardwalk and boats, or, if you choose, quaint cobblestone Fell Street, or perhaps, the lovely courtyard in the center of the structure. Every luxury and ammenity awaits. Each room is equipped with fine furnishings, a magnificent bath, and all the conveniences one expects in a fine hotel. You can step out of the building, and stroll down to the heart of Fells Point in a matter of minutes--walk a bit further and be at the famous Inner Harbor. Great dining and entertainment are literally steps away!! The handy water-taxi will take you almost anywhere, and is really fun!

I think everyone has done a pretty good job of talking about the great points of this Inn - beautifully renovated rooms, great continental breakfast, choice of wine on check-in, and courteous staff. I'll just throw in a few things I haven't seen talked about much. We stayed in room 139. We paid for run of the house, so that's what we got. It was the first room by the reception, and we could see a bit of the marina, but we also saw a lot of people pass by. It was not loud, but it was slightly distracting. As stated by others, we also had our shutters closed 99% of the time. The room has an Ipod dock, which was nice. It also had a nice sitting area, and was quite large in general. The TV is DISH network satellite, so there are a ton of channels, including just about every movie channel under the sun (they start at channel 300). The description online says a \"queen bed\" but we most certainly had a king. It was comfortable to lounge in, but a bit soft for us, and by morning my husband had a sore back. Just made us get up a bit earlier and enjoy more of the day! The bathroom was very pretty. Not huge, but nice fixtures on the sink and fresh flowers. I wouldn't say this is a complaint, but it struck me as odd that they had done such a nice job of updating the bathroom, but didn't put in a better shower head. Pressure was okay, but I think a better shower head would have really upped the experience. Minor quip, I know. The area surrounding the hotel is full of bars. Some restaurants, but mostly taverns. There were some incredibly drunk people by 6 pm on Saturday wobbling through the area less than two blocks away. It wasn't a problem for us, but may be of some issue to someone else. There are also NO services within a 5-6 block range, so no running out to get a beverage or a razor if you forgot one without a pretty significant hike. In fact, when I asked the front desk where the closest \"convenience store\" was, she just kind of gave me a blank stare. FYI - there is a liquor store at the Broadway Market. There is also a 7-11 on Lombard street, but that's about a mile away. Taxi ride to Inner Harbor is between $6-$7 plus tip. Water taxi is $18 per day, unlimited, but it's not particularly fast. All in all, it really is a beautiful hotel. I would definitely stay here again.

I especially enjoyed this hotel because I'm not fond of the closed-in feeling I get in highrise hotels, no matter how lovely they may be. It was so delightful to just walk out the door at the end of the corridor and be on the wharf with the breeze (rain, wind, sun- had them all) and water and boats. It was really interesting to see an enormous storm blow through one afternoon also. We had rented a car and especially appreciated the free parking in the lot that was just steps away. My son lives in Baltimore and the staff even gave him a pass so he could use the parking lot, as opposed to trying to find on-street parking, when he came over pick us up and to have dinner with us one evening.

It seemed that even the most expensive area hotels had a much higher percentage of mediocre or bad reviews, and Henderson\u2019s had basically all positive experiences. Now, having stayed there, its my experience too. They offer tremendous value. And the location on the water, cant be beat either. That being said, even a hotel with so many positive reviews can get a bad or mediocre one from time to time, but the chances of having a good experience here, I would say is as close to a sure thing as possible. Remember, customers have to accept some responsibility in making sure their stay is a pleasant one, and that includes asking for what you want, be it the type of room you want, or the view you want, or what the accommodations are like, or ease of parking etc. The more informed you are, the less likely there are that things are not to your liking. Was the parking lot the most convenient, no, but its close, and FREE!!! If it were paved, it might be better, but, it\u2019s a minor issue. Are they the fanciest rooms in the world, no\u2026but neither are they $2500 a night! (Which I\u2019ve done also). But they are terrific for the money, well furnished, nicely decorated, good attention to detail, and id say worth 50% to 75% more, and equal to rooms twice the price at the major hotel chains, ie; Hyatt, Sheraton, etc. One of the nicest things about these rooms, is, they are not standard, run of the mill, boring, cookie cutter hotel rooms. Ive stayed in lots and lots of those\u2026and never ever\u2026.need to remember them for any reason. Even the more expensive hotel chain type rooms are basically the same as the cheap rooms, only a bit larger\u2026big deal!!! The included continental breakfast is so far above what you would get at any other hotel in this area that its laughable. And, if you have a penchant for snacks or drink in the room, the well stocked mini bar and snack selection is one of the best ive seen\u2026at any hotel! Granted, its for pay, but, its worth the convenience if you get the munchies late at night! The gratis bottle of wine is a nice touch. The fact that this small hotel makes you feel less of a stranger, and more of a guest, makes you want to come back again and again, and the front desk staff is pleasant, and courteous. So, all in all, on a scale of 1 to 10, id give them a 9.975! the only markdown for the gravel parking lot\u2026.but overall\u2026\u2026..Bravo Henderson\u2019s, Bravo!!!", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cThank you trip advisor!!!! :)\u201d", "Author": "Squashblossom79", "ReviewID": "UR14184649", "Content": "I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, booked solely on pictures and others reviews on trip advisor...what a wonderful little place, located at the quieter end of the harbor.

The hotel was very clean, neat and offered some very nice amenities: Complimentary Bottle of Wine in the Room, Direct TV with Wide Screen LCD TV, free wireless in the rooms and cleaning wipes at the desk for your monitor. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that they do not have Valet Car Park, Room Service or Bell Boys.

We had a reservation at the Marriott next to Camden Yards as well and decided to stay at the Henderson. The hotel was charming, clean, had a wonderful view right on the dock, and had a great continental breakfast. We loved the big bathroom and bathrobes in our 2 queen harbor-view room. We didn't like the $392/night room rate (which was seriously inflated due to the ball games). The Marriott was even a bit higher. We opted for the Henderson Wharf Inn to be a little removed from the hustle and bustle of Inner Harbor, but in hindsight probably should have stayed at the Marriott in our case. Let me explain - for the Saturday night game we intended to take the water taxi back and forth and did so during the day. When we headed to the 7:05 game at 4:45 pm, the line was very long at the water taxi - several boats worth - so we took a regular taxi into the Inner Harbor and had to walk a ways to reach the stadium. The taxis didn't want to get too close and get caught in traffic. The water taxis normally run until 11:00 pm or 30 minutes after the last out. In the 7th inning - our 7 year old was getting tired, it was 10:00 pm - so we left, concerned that we had a long walk back to the water taxi pick-up area and didn't want to miss our ride back. I think it would have been much easier to just walk across the street to the Marriott. We also had tickets to the game the following Sunday afternoon - and could have slept in later to just walk across the street again for the next game. All that being said - we would definitely return to the Henderson Wharf Inn - but not in conjunction with a ballgame and water taxi transportation.

I love to walk and I enjoyed exploring this neighborood on foot and walking along the water. There were plenty of other people walking at all hours. The room was very large (I had room 109 -- a corner room) and the bed was comfy. Enough lamps for reading. Bathroom was very large and very clean with plenty of towels and excellent hot water and excellent water pressure. Staff were very warm and friendly although some were more knowledgeable than othrs. Coffee always available in the lobby, and a computer in an alcove off the lobby for internet access. Parking is nearby and convenient, although half the time the gate wouldn't open for me and I had to seek help. All of the rooms are on the first floor so you need to close the blinds if you want privacy! Otherwise the many people strolling by can look right into your room. Taking an evening stroll, I was easily able to see one woman sitting in bed reading in her pajamas, and a couple who were snuggling. But if you shut the blinds, you lose the wonderful harbor views. There is a free breakfast buffet in the lobby which is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. An extraordinary amount of fresh fruit -- raspberries, strawbetrries, grapes, bananas, melon, pineapple -- plus pastries, bagels, cereal, bagels, yoghurt and cheese. And coffee. All constantly replenished. You can take a tray and bring what you want back to your room or you can sit at a table in a lovely courtyard.

It's structurally beautiful, clean as a whistle & perfectly designed. Cal Ripken was being inducted that day in the Baseball Hall of Fame, so the fans were obviously supportive of their hometown hero. Now about the hotel......Loved it!!!! The building was beautiful inside & out. We had a Harbor View room, little pricey, but worth it. As other reviewers have mentioned people do walk past the windows, but we didn't find it intrusive at all. Not a big continental breakfast fan, but this was one of the best I've ever seen. We stayed 3 nights & the fruits & danish/breads/bagels varied each day. Fresh fruit, dried prunes, fresh dates, cottage cheese, apple cinnamon bread.....just a few choices. I don't drink coffee much, but it was very good. There's a great assortment of Tazo teas for you tea todler's. Ceramic mugs as well as styrofoam cups with lids are availble. Oh & coffee & teas are available 24/7. The staff was extremely helpful & pleasant. Go, trust me you'll enjoy. I didn't realize how many different sections there are in Baltimore. Between, the Harbor, Fells Point & all the other areas there are TONS of restaurants. You may want to do a little homework on the different neighborhoods & restaurants before you go. Bring comfy shoes. Cobblestone streets are not condusive to sandals or heels. We took the Duck Tour which is in the Inner Harbor. Very touristy & slightly cheesy, but fun & informative. These tours are availble in other City's like Miami for one. If you're not aware they are vehicles that were used by the US Army in WW2. They are amphibious which means they travel by land like a bus & then the Captain drives the duck right into the water. It was very informative. Take it your first day there. The Information Center was also one of the best I've ever seen. If staying at Henderson's (which is in Fells Point), you can walk or so I was told, my feet wouldn't allow it, take the Water Taxi which is $8 per day per adult or take a cab. Cabs are seven bucks & economically the better choice to get to the Inner Harbor. Unfortunately while we were in the City the Harbor was experiencing something called \"Red Tide\" which as I understand it is a bacterial organism which depletes the water of oxygen & the fish die in great numbers. There were alot of dead fish floating in the Harbor. In Fells Point we ate at Koopers,Red Star, Shuckers & Brick Oven Pizza. I would skip Schuckers, but take it from an italian don't miss BOP!

Overall, I would say the Inn provides a strong value for the dollar spent ratio. Solid service, nicely decorated spaces, and comfort. If you don't mind being in this part of Fell's Point (about a mile from Inner harbor/Downtown) then the Inn is a great lodging option. The Inn encompasses the 1st floor of the old wharf building. The rest of the structure has been rehabbed into private condos. Keep that in mind when choosing courtyard or harbor view. The building is surrounded by the wharf which will have pedestrians on it...right outside your harbor view windows. The room was nicely furnished and the bed was quite comfortable, if a bit high. The bathroom was fine, quality toiletries were provided. The rooms have the infamous Sat Tv's, which can be a bit daunting for the uninitiated. Lots of channel options, though. Our room was a bit plain, it could use some art or something on the bare walls. The art ourtside in the public areas is nice, except that one scary fish eating the other not so scary fish. One is supposed to get a comp bottle of wine, but ours was not in the room. A small error, especialy given we don't much like wine. A reasonably good breakfast is served each morning, and as stated, seating is a priority during winter months. Space is at a premium, the lobby is not cavernous, so finding a place ot eat can be difficult. The solution: take a tray back to your room. The staff was attentive and helpful. This is not a full-service hotel, the manpower is smaller but we were treated well and with professionalism. They did a fine job. Fell's Point is my favorite part of Baltimore and the Inn is at a great location way out at the end of Fell. Walking to the better areas of Fell's Point is easy, a cab downtown is $7-10 and simple to catch. For leisure travelers the Inn is superb. For those most interested in the Inner Harbor or downtown it is a bit farther afield than many other Baltimore hotels, but that said, the Inn is first-rate. Henderson's Wharf Inn is number one on these pages for a reason. I do believe that ranking is well deserved. I would not hesitate to stay at the Inn on my next visit to baltimore.

It is a Kimpton property, which generally means it is in an older building that has had some cosmetic updating. The pros: nice people; wine reception, free coffee in the morning in the lobby; pretty nice fitness center; free internet if you join the Kimpton program (which is free, so just do it); pretty quiet. The cons; my room was TINY-tiny closet (clothes had to hang diagonally, had to move the iron board to make room); tiny bathroom; window facing wall; main areas and hallways rather drab.

This is a great boutique hotel and my second time at a Kimpton property. My impression of Kimpton hotels so far is stylish, great location, excellent service. The room was small but not tiny, and right in line with any other boutique hotel in the city. There are a lot of small details that make the rooms very comfy and sleek. Decor is very unique and the beds were luxurious. There were 2 very fluffy robes in our room which was a nice touch. Because it was New Year's Eve, they had a champagne hour in the lobby which was a nice surprise. In the morning, it was a hot chocolate bar. Both Kimpton hotels I've stayed at had i-pod docks in the room which is a big win for me. I love having music in the room when I'm getting ready. Wireless is free if you sign up for Kimpton loyalty program (which takes maybe 2 minutes and is free). One thing I will say which became a running joke is the tiny closet. We were only there 1 night so we just had coats to put in, but it is literally only 8 inches deep, so the coat hangers have to be hung at an angle. This would've bugged me if I stayed there multiple nights on a business trip, but in my case, it was just a funny detail.

We absolutely adore them. We have given the Allegro two chances now to win our business and both visits have been less than stellar. Looking at our most recent stay, we chose their largest room, a King Suite with 2 person Jacuzzi. I had asked the concierge if they could assist with some champagne and chocolates in the room when we arrived and was assured it would be taken care of. I even offered to pay for them and Anthony assured me it was on the house. We arrived a little after 5 in the evening and proceeded to wait about 20 minutes to check in. It was a Friday evening and the hotel was quite busy, but they only had 1 individual working the check-in desk. We finally got checked in and went upstairs to the room. We walked in and though the room was nice, it was quite worn. The tabletops were full of scratches and water marks and the carpet had some stains. It was overall very clean though. One thing missing though, was the chocolates and champagne. I was assured they would be in the room for the surprise. Well I went downstairs and the concierge was nowhere to be found. I went to the front desk and waited through the line again and explained. She looked it up and said, \"oh yes I see that amenity was added, I'm sorry they must be on their way, wait a bit and they should show up.\" I went back upstairs and we got changed for going out and still no amenity. I tried calling the concierge and finally got through. He apologized and said he would send them up right away. When they arrived we received 4 bon bons ina plastic container and a bottle of brut. OK, I get it, it was a free amenity, but I would have paid for something a little more extravagant, and if it would have been on time. Our next problem was they gave us an adjoining suite with the baseball weekend revelers from you-know-where. They were so loud and obnoxious we could hear every word of their vulgar conversations. Ultimately I decided to go say something at the front desk. They said they would send security up and that they had no other rooms, I would have to just wait and see if security could quiet them. We went out to dinner and came back to you guessed it, party central next door. I called the front desk again, and they said they woudl send a friendly reminder up to them. They quieted down for about 20 minutes then back at it again. Luckily our sleeping quarters were on the other side of the suite. The next morning we could hear every word of the housekeepers' inappropriate conversation next door. Think slurs and sexual innuendo... The next day the front desk manager sent a cheese and wine amenity up to make up for the hassle but again, I would have rather had a quiet night than cheese and bubbly. Alltogether, it would be ok for a business stay or quick overnight but I think we are done attempting the Allegro Chicago experience.

I would like to expand a bit upon that review as I have just finished my 2011-2012 Lyric Opera Season and have spent six nights at the Allegro. First, the staff is just great, so friendly, so helpful. Once this year I had to arrive early for a luncheon at noon and was sure my room would not be ready until the usual 3:00 P.M. hour, but it was ready and I did not have to schlepp around luggage. The location is just fabulous as the Hotel is located on Randolph which is really alive these days as to musicals. The Restaurant 312 located in the Hotel has turned into an outstanding Italian locale and the pastas are really great, and not expensive as Chicago prices go. I certainly can recommend dining there once while one is in Chicago. The lobby of the hotel is so pleasant and though busy, it is almost always quiet. A nice place for a conversation and at 5:00 P.M. there is complimentary wine. The rooms are small as this Hotel was built in think in the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but has been so beautifully renovated , but the rooms are impeccably clean and comfortable and though the bath is also small, the plumbing is modern and it has a great shower. Of course, if one wants larger rooms or even a suite, they are available, but I began my traveling around fifty years ago with Europe on Five Dollars a Day-now, an hour or less ,and so I seek out moderately priced places as long as I am pleased with the service, the room, etc. Chicago has some fabulously opulent Hotels, but one can always just pop in for a drink or whatever.

He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say 2 words to us and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look particularly happy to be working in general. He just started to take our things from the cab, without a word, and loaded them onto a rack to wheel off. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t polite, or welcoming, but more abrupt and grumpy. Ok, Sir, fine. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re creepy and their cookey\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) Once inside, the bellman took off, no where to be found or to be seen again. We stood inside of what looked EXACTLY like an old haunted house in this makeshift lobby area. Where do we go now? There was no reception area on the street level, and it is bit confusing. We both looked at each other unsure of where to go next. There was an eerie stairwell in the center of the room, and we were searching for the reception area so we could check in. We walked over to some bar / restaurant to the left, jiggled the door handle and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nothing. It was locked and no one inside. We just looked at each other, blankly. Suddenly, the elevator doors opened and a lurch-like, creepy elevator guy emerged. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mysterious and spookey\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello, right this way\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We hopped in with him, and once exited, THIS now looked a lot more like a Kimpton property that I am used to: trendy, swanky, and boutique-ie. We were going to be a little early for our reservation so I had called ahead early to get put down for an early check in to our suite. When we got there, a female manager, red headed with a strict-like personality retorted that the check in time is 3 PM and she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get us in until then. Again, this employee wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly welcoming or accomodating. Ugh. I would have appreciated a call saying they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet this request, but can take us at 3 PM, so we could have planned accordingly. We were just at the absolutely STUNNING Park Hyatt Chicago and could have gotten a late check out at 2:30 PM, which would have timed us perfectly for our check in at the Allegro. We sat calmly and enjoyed the lemon flavored ice water in trendy containers in the lobby. This was a nice touch, and we relaxed while we waited for our room to be ready. It occurred to us that we needed to eat, so we made our way to the dining room that is connected to the lobby. (BTW, she could have suggested a meal in the dining area while we waited as by the time it occurred to us that one existed, they were close to their closing time.) When we entered the restaurant, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a soul upstairs, and certainly not a worker to direct us. Were they open? Were they closed? Not a peep. It was just empty inside and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6eerie. We made our way downstairs where we had to negotiate with the staff for a cup of coffee. They told us that their brunch was about to end and they would be shutting down for a while. Now\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this is just a bit weird to me. Most hotels keep their restaurants open to accommodate their guests. This was sort of annoying. Looking around, half of the restaurant was abandoned and our waitress was very odd. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all together ooky\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) Obviously, based on my description, this hotel property is just a little strange. The staff is pretty mixed in demeanor and just inconsistent all around. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good: The food here is excellent and well priced. This is one quality that I have come to count on and expect from Kimpton properties. The food here was REALLY good. We got the mushroom and goat cheese crostini and coffees. They ended up serving us and this was great. Unlike the killer, shockingly high breakfast prices that you may find at other Chicago hotels (like the Conrad, etc) you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find bad prices here. Instead, they are very fair priced, nice portions and amazing food. (Points for that.) You get more than what you pay for here, and I find that at most Kimpton properties. Finally checked into our 2 person Jacuzzi suite, it was quite underwhelming. The absolutely stunning professional pictures online is what lured us in, coupled with a rock bottom price on this room, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they have there. Wow. Looking around the room, we were not blown away, I have to say. This hotel was built in the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and was renovated, but it still feels dark, dingy and cheap, no matter how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kimptonized\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it was. It still just feels like a cheap, slapped together hotel. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is old and the furnishings look like it was cobbled together from various garage sales. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the sleek, modern, cool vibe that you get with most Kimpton hotels. Fret not, you still get the amazing Kimpton amenities, like the animal printed robes (classic!) and the $10 in free minibar with your Kimpton rewards membership. Also, I did find the bathroom to be pretty cool, and well designed. This was probably the one area that felt like a true Kimpton property. We did enjoy the complementary wine hour, although we are not big wine drinkers in general. They were playing pleasant music and it had a more friendly vibe downstairs for the hour.

Each morning there is complimentary tea, coffee etc in reception and there is always a member of staff on hand to answer a query / solve any issues. The hotel has a 'Happy Hour' every evening, again in reception which was an ideal place to meet up after a hectic day and relax. Staff are on hand to present you with a glass of wine, beer or a 'hot toddy/mulled wine' and nibbles are served which was all very civilised and relaxing!

This review is more about a few items I thought hotel guests might want to be be aware of before booking here. First, if you want any kind of a view (besides the fire escape and brick wall of next building) ask not to be placed in room 419. The room itself is nice, you just wont get any light in your room even if there is a window. Secondly, the fourth floor is the same floor where pets are placed. I had no idea about this until I suddenly heard a loud howl outside my room. When I looked out I saw two more dogs in the hallway with their owners. Normally I wouldn't care about being on the same floor as dogs, but when you get an animal that barks and howls every time someone walks past the door it can be a problem. The hotel staff was very nice and tried to contact the owners but was unsuccessful. The hotel did offer to move us but since we had completely unpacked and were on our way out we didn't take them up on their offer. I realized that once the dog's owners returned to the room the problem would very likely disappear so I wasn't concerned about having my sleep disturbed.

We shopped around on TripAdvisor, looking for a neat little place to stay and I was thrilled when I saw the pictures of Hotel Allegro's rooms (blue is my favorite color!). We decided to double-check on the price we found for Friday night on Cheapostay ($169/night) so we called the hotel's reservations and they offered us the room at $113! Wow! We booked it right away :) When we arrived, we were greeted at our car by the doorman who helped us decide whether the valet parking or self-park would be better for us. We opted to use the self-park right around the corner as we decided that it was going to be a relaxing weekend and we would prefer to have someone chauffeur us around :) we took taxis the whole time during our 2 day trip (it made perfect sense too. We paid $72 for 2 days of parking and probably paid about $70 for all of our cab rides, but parking in the city is expensive, depending on where you go. We just fig'd, \"Hey, forget the stress, we're on vacation!\"). After having the door opened for us with a smile, we were meet by a Bell Hop (do people still say that? haha) who asked us if we would like help with our bags. We took the elevator to the lobby and were met by Gianna (spelling?) at the front desk, who is an absolute asset to the hotel as far as customer service is concerned. She had a smile on her face the entire time and was as polite as if we were her friends, making us feel completely at home. As a former gate agent for an airline, I know what its like to deal with customers all day long and have to say, this girl does her job and she does it well :) We then went to our room and, as two 25-year-olds, were very pleased with the decor! The prints on the walls and the floor, the funky blue picture on the wall, and the...pillow. top. mattress...I can't even really think about it, we're back home now and I honestly don't sleep that good in my own bed. HAHA :) I read the other reviews on the smallness of the bathrooms and I have to say, even though I hate to, they are a little bit small, but CMON, Its a BATHROOM and $113 a night? IN THE CITY? If you can't handle that, you've got bigger problems, my friend ;) We had only booked Friday night, but after we went out to Spy Bar and Sound Bar (great electronic clubs, if that's what you're in to, GO), got back to our room at 4am on Saturday and feel into that bed, I knew we were staying another night. Dreading hearing how much booking the room for Saturday night at such short notice was going to be, I apprehensively called the front desk and spoke to _____ (hate that I didn't get everyone's name, they were all so nice) who booked the room for us at -wait for it- $113 again!!! Beside myself with joy and craving food at 4am, I instinctively picked up the pillow menu that was waiting for us when we had arrived and began scribbling down all sorts of delicacies that I would be happy to wake up to :) Eddie arrived promptly, with great customer service in tow, at the time that we indicated on our card (how would I know really, though, I was sleeping like a baby) and wheeled a cart into our room holding an array of delicious breakfast foods: French Toast with fresh-cut bananas, Hot Chai Tea with Soy milk, an Omelet with Sausage, Hot Coffee, fresh-cut cantaloupe, oranges and strawberries and crisp toast wrapped in a napkin with jam and jelly on the side. MMMMM, my mouth is watering just thinking about it :) We checked out the next day, sad to go, but feeling refreshed after a much-needed 2-day in the Windy City. The receptionist who checked us out (again, wish I had caught her name, very nice) suggested with a smile that we check out Yolk for breakfast, but it was so packed when we got there (darned Bears game haha) that we opted to hit up TripAdvisor again for some Breakfast Wisdom and were not disappointed to drive a little further and dine at The Breakfast Club (which I need to write another review on. GREAT Breakfast & service. Do not judge a book by its cover, this place is amazing) Hotel Allegro gets a 5-Star review from me.

We visit Chicago once a year, as I am originally from the Chicago-land area, and are always tempted to try new hotels. Last year, we stayed at the Dana Spa (which was great). This year, after scoring a deal, we decided to try out the King Premiere room. The room is colorful, large, and modern. The bathroom, however, is TINY compared to the size of the room. The bed was big, comfy, and had soft pillows and luxurious sheets. I loved the wallpaper and the funky furniture (but this might not be for all). Overall, for what we were planning to do in the city (the architectural boat tour- a must and Second City) this hotel was a good location. We were able to walk to the boat tour (about 10 minutes on foot) and were just a short taxi ride away from Second City. During the day, the streets are busy and in the early evening you see many people headed to the theaters. However, once the theaters are done for the night, we found that the area was stranded and were accosted twice by strange men for money for the train, etc. Also, the proximity to the blue line was amazing! (A short 5 minute walk, which came in handy since we had a 6 AM flight to catch to NYC the next morning!) The only other disappointment I had was our view. Last year, the Dana, had floor to ceiling windows that allowed you to see breathtaking views of the city. The Kimpton, however, had views of the parking lot, and other buildings. So, if you're looking for a breathtaking view of the city, this may not cut it for you. Kimpton hotels, in general, are great. They cater to the tourist with their free coffee in the morning, and afternoon wine hours. They also are pet-friendly and even have treats and water on the street for when your dogs arrive!

Both nights we enjoyed the wine reception in the lobby and the coffee/tea in the mornings. We also used the concierge services during the wine reception one night to book an architectural boat tour.

The lobby is a kalediscope of color with lots of chairs (some quite unusual) to sit down and enjoy the ambience. Joseph at reception was professional and helpful. The hotel was built in 1926-1928 originally called the Bismark and lots of history. It underwent a large renovation approx 15 years ago. I had a room on the 8th floor that was not facing the street so just looking onto another building with no view. The room was okay size (not large by any standard but sufficient cpnsidering it is downown Chicago). The rooms I felt were a bit garish. The silver wallpaper with shapes, the cocoon shaped ceiling lamp, the large blue print of a guitar on the wall and the huge mirror across from the bed. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever been in - when you are standing at the sink the back of your leg is touching against the toilet bowl. The closet is also very small. The airconditioning unit was quiet which was great. The rooms come with a fridge and a safe. Every 20 mins or so the fan on the fridge would kick in and was quite loud. Insulation between the rooms is mediocre. I was fortunate to meet George the hotel electrician who was a wealth of knowledge and gave me lots of history on the hotel. There are some nice confernce rooms especially the Walnut room and ask about the history of the chandeliers. There is also an interesting old mail slot that runs vertically down through the building and still works. House cleaning was good and room was kept nice and clean with good lotions in the bathroom. It is worth joining the In Touch Kimpton rewards program - sign up free online before staying there and get $10 worth of items from the minfridge free during your stay. The hotel is very close to the CTA (train station) where Blue line runs to and from O Hare airport in 40 mins for $2.25.

Our specific room requests, including rooms on the same floor were honored even though the hotel was sold out for that night. The children, including the baby were given a back pack with lots of toys and goodies, and we were given coupons for free kids breakfast both days. The lobby is located on the second floor of this hotel and is very comfortably laid out with plenty of couches and comfy chairs. There is a kid's program. which includes toys, games, wii, popcorn and lemonade located in the lobby from 4:00-5:00 each day. 5:00-6:00 is an adult hour with complimentary wine and hors'devours. Complimentary iced lemon water and a tea/apple juice blend are available in the lobby throughout the day. We stayed in a King Premier room which was quite spacious, except for the bathroom. The bathroom was very very tiny, but it met our basic needs so no specific complaints (the tiny bathroom is the only reason i rated this hotel with 4 stars instead of 5). The hotel itself is a historic renovated building so there is a lot of character and new charm blended together. Overall the hotel is very clean and well maintained despite its age. Overall, the best feature of this hotel is its staff. Everyone that we encountered from the front desk, to restaurant, conceirge, housekeeping ,etc were extremely friendly and courteous. Upon returning to our room the first night, we found a lovely welcome card with an invitation to the hotel's bar for a complimentary drink and appetizer, a bottle of wine and chocolate. It was an unexpected and delightful touch. Upon checkout, the bellman was outstanding. I wish i could remember his name to give him special recognition here. He was so prompt, courteous and went above and beyond to help my family and my sister with all of our luggage, baby supplies, etc. It can be very challenging traveling with small children, especially in the cramped quarters of a large city and we appreciated the outstanding attention and care that this hotel provided to us and the kids. It really made our stay enjoyable. As an aside, we popped into a neighboring hotel for a quick cocktail in the hotel's lounge. We had all taken a few sips of our drinks when we were asked to leave because the children were not behaving appropriately (they actually weren't behaving any differently than they did at the Allegro).

First, the goods. It's in a good location, within walking distance to Millennium Park, the shops on State Street and I walked to the Mag Mile although most people may want to cab it and/or take the train there instead. It is, however, not in a great location. If you really want to be centrally located, then you should stay closer to the Mag Mile. The lobby is beautiful and hotel has a purposefully old and retro feel to it that some may like. They have free HH every night bt 5 to 6 pm and the gym is pretty nice. The bed and pillows were comfy. Now, for the bads. The rooms are small, even by big city standards. I realize that hotel rooms in places like Chicago and NY are going to be on the small side, but it was a shoebox and the bathroom is the size of a very small closet. The walls are paper thin, I could hear everything that was going on next door and in the hallway, including a laugh fest at 2 am that woke me up. Clearly, this is an old hotel and they're trying hard to hide the shabbiness of the rooms but not quite doing enough. The paint is chipped and things just looked plain used and abused. Finally, and most annoyingly, I put in a request for a rollaway right when I checked in and when I checked again, I was told there wasn't any available. And that was it. I had to stare at the lady to even get an apology or explanation (I can't figure out why they can't set one aside when I put the request in and/or get more rollaway beds). Then I asked for late checkout and the front desk told me it wasn't a problem, but when I went to confirm it, the front desk said no such request had been made. I still got my late check out, but not before a staff member knocked on my door to see if I was still there. For people who are in the hospitality business, the staff wasn't particularly hospitable (except for the cleaning staff, those folks work hard and don't get paid enough).

The staff was very accomodating with any of our requests and provided complimentary umbrellas to use on rainy days. The lobby area and overall hotel looked more worn than expected and could maybe use some new carpets. Our room was a decent size. The decor was quirky, the shower pressure acceptable, and the bed comfortable. They also supply nice Aveda bath amenities. The hotel's location is optimal if you are looking to get around anywhere in the city. Just about everything was within walking distance (Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile, Willis Tower, etc.) and the subway stop was only a 5 minute walk away. You certainly can't beat that!

The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. This is unacceptable to us. The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night.

We got a great deal on a Junior Suite. The room was very nice- typical Kimpton decor-- but I wish we had booked a room with two beds instead of the suite. The 'living room' area went virtually unused. SniqueAway only offered the king-bed options however. We arrived from the airport very late to a warm welcome. I had signed up for the Kimpton frequent stay program InTouch (finally!) and was surprised to find out that part of that program includes a $10 credit to the mini-bar. We also had a fun laugh over the leopard and tiger-print bathrobes hanging in the closet. The next morning we worked out in the fitness room that was on our floor. (The founder is a strong believer in hula hoops so those were available for use!) We spent most of the day away from the hotel, with a quick stop before dinner to shower and change. Chicago was much colder (overcast & rainy) than we expected so we couldn't pile on enough clothes. The Loop location was central, but still felt like we weren't in the middle of anything. I'm sure it's much more hustle & bustle during theater season, but the streets directly surrounding the hotel were dead. (Great for sleeping!) You had to walk a few blocks in any direction to stumble upon some life. Overall I liked the location b/c it was nice to only be a short block from everything, it was just strange to exit the hotel to such quiet streets in the middle of a major city. Like most Kimptons, this hotel has the happy hour (free wine) from 5-6PM. Unfortunately we couldn't take advantage, but from the looks of it other guests had fun competing with each other on the Wii. Kimpton uses it as a way for people to get to know each other. On our last day we checked out, they held our luggage for us for the day. When we returned, they directed us to a bathroom where we could change before our flight. And then the subway stop for the airport line was only blocks away- very easy!!

It's very close to transit which made it easy to get to the airport as it sits pretty much on the blue line. Noise wasn't an issue for us, but it definately could be if you were on a lower floor. It's pretty close to the Chicago theatre, but not close to some of the better dining in the city as it'd be better to be a bit further north. Rooms were kept clean, and the hotel in general was nice. Couldn't find an ice machine, as nothing in the hallways were clearly marked. We ate a the hotel bar below and the food was average at best. It's better to dine elsewhere. One weird thing is that the reception is on the 2nd floor, up the staircase so it's not the best. However, be aware of the slow (sometimes - super slow) elevators. All in a good hotel at the right price.

Someone should've mentioned to the \"designer\" that the darker the paint, the smaller the room appears. A blue room? Seriously? Website states, \"Design inspired by retro luxury cruise ships\". If they were going for a scene from the 70's/80's classic \"The Love Boat\", I think they nailed it. The mirror in the room was useless since it had some dirt-like looking designs on them. I'm assuming the age of the building had to do with the fact that the bathroom had no exhaust fan. God forbid I took a hot shower! Waiting about 20 minutes after to use the bathroom mirror was annoying. Sink was small, useless, and you had to have the water running slowly otherwise it'd splash everywhere.

They also did not offer slippers which I always like at hotel.The one nice thing was that all their toiletries were Aveda, which was a very nice. The towels were not great -very fibery and I would get all these little white fibers all over my face every time I wiped my faced. The one big tnegative was that they didn't offer free internet/wireless. You had to sign up to their kimpton \"keep in touch\" club to get internet and I counldn't tell if I had to pay or not to join. Needless to say, it was too much work just to figure out how to get free internet access. I would think that by now it should be standard for hotels to provide internet to their guests. However, one big plus was that they offered free cocktail hour everyday from 5-6pm. I think that's the hotel's saving grace. They offered white & red wine, strawberry sangria and beer which was really nice. And overall all the hotel staff were very very nice. But, would I stay at another kimpton hotel?

The room was a good size and had everything we needed. The bathroom was rather small, but okay for 2 people since we were only there for a couple of days.

In the morning they also provide complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby. All that being said, I was surprised to find that, though this hotel is located in the theatre area/downtown, there were not THAT many restaurant options in the direct vicinity to the hotel, only a handful. We found we had to walk north of the river to find more variety. The area was also very quiet at night which could be a positive or a negative depending on what you're looking for. It was negative for us, since nothing seemed to be open past 6pm. You couldn't even get a coffee anywhere (unless you went to McDonalds...). Perhaps our ages may have been a factor, as we are both in our mid to late 20s, so we would have preferred being closer to a bit of nightlife and having the option to walk somewhere closer to have a drink that was not in the hotel restaurant. It all depends what you are looking for. The hotel itself was lovely and very clean. The staff were always very friendly and helpful if you needed anything.

Due to flight delays I didn't check in until after 9PM and was placed in a room across from the elevators on the 12th floor. I typically don't care to stay in such centrally located rooms due to elevator noise but I figured I would try and ignore that and not make a fuss. The room was small, which is fine, the bathroom was small which is fine, the closet?? was pretty much non-existent. It was about the size of a broom closet and I am not kidding! It had one curving bar about 4 feet off the ground and another one higher probably about 8 feet off the ground, clearly out of reach. I tried hanging a few of my items only to find that my pants were dragging on the floor on the lower bar and that there just wasn't sufficient room to hang anything. I closed the door and called downstairs only to be told rather dismissively that they had no rooms available. I then went to open the \"closet\" door only to find it was stuck! it never opened again. So I ended up draping my clothes all around the room. Hey I understand quaint and cute, I live in the Northeast and am familiar with all that. This was unfit to be called a hotel room IMHO. Then again there seemed to be several young men staying in the hotel and a number of them on my floor who were under the impression they were in a dorm and yelling down the hall while keeping the elevator doors open was appropriate behavior.. when I called downstairs I was told they could move me to another room at 11pm at night... I told them I was ready to go to bed and since I was checking out the next day that was not the solution I was looking for. So of course I got to wake up when they all returned from their night of partying at 4AM. I'm guessing they were not quiet walking in the door of the hotel either so perhaps someone could've reminded them that this was a hotel??? then again since these guys needed no closet space so perhaps this was a perfect fit for them.. Anyway, clearly if you arrive late in the day regardless of the fact that you prepaid for your room you get stuck where they want to stick you. Not cool.. I did not want to make my son feel bad so although I would change hotels under other circumstances I stayed there. When checking out the Rooms Manager was very apologetic about my experience and I hope they heard me..

Let me first start by saying the staff were wonderful, Anthony, Erica, Chuck, Corey, Demond, all made me feel very welcomed every morning, afternoon, evening, and any other part of the day I saw them. Anthony is very knowledgeable about places in the area (and anywhere in Chicago really) so if you are undecided where to go on the town don't hesitate to ask. The wine hour is just so wonderful too! (Complementary wine hour from 5pm-6pm everyday.... Yes everyday!) I especailly like the art-deco theme of the hotel very posh and welcoming. If you are a walker like I am (New York City girl, so I have no problem walking tons of blocks) then you will enjoy the mile long stroll to Magnificent Mile, but if you prefer cabs then they're easily available too. You are located in the middle of the theatre district, so if you like plays, or tours of these historic places this is the place for you. The blue line \"EL\" train is close by as well (as soon as you leave the hotel make a left turn and it's at most 750 feet away, how lovely is that? You could take it straight O'Hare airport for $2.25 and arrive in no time, most major cities don't have the subway this accessible to downtown areas but this worked out great for me).

Received a free upgrade to a King Suite, which was HUGE and absolutely beautiful, decorated in geometric/retro patterns. The bed was so comfortable, you could just sink right into it. A few hours after check-in, complimentary champagne and chocolates were sent up, which was a pleasant surprise. For dinner, we had been unable to secure reservations at a restaurant within walking distance, but after asking one of the staff members during cocktail hour for a recommendation, he suggested we speak to the concierge. The concierge was busy right then with another guest, so we found an empty seat on the other side of the room and enjoyed our drinks while waiting. The next thing we knew, the concierge actually crossed the room to approach us and discuss our potential dinner options. Yes, he came to us! He gave us some great ideas, and then got reservations for us at the restaurant we decided to try, Sullivan's Steakhouse (Phenomenal food, btw!). The only aspects of our stay that were less than first class were the restaurant (Chicago 312) and bar (Encore) that are attached to the hotel. They were okay, but nothing special. The hotel though is fabulous, amazing, and we will definitely be back!", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cabsolute delight\u201d", "Author": "ElkeGelke", "ReviewID": "UR98597134", "Content": "I don't know when I have been as delighted with a hotel stay as I was with Hotel Allegro in Chicago.

I don't know why or how to explain it exactly, but the stylishness, coziness, warmth, staff friendliness and 'bonhomie' of other Kimpton Hotels is sadly lacking here. Maybe it's the cavernous, cold lobby itself or the fact that you have to take an elevator or stairs from street level to the lobby? Maybe it's the cheesy way the lobby is decorated with a mish-mash of furniture, styles, colors and ugly carpeting. Frankly, it's depressing. Its dark brown color scheme is off-putting. And, now that the tone of the hotel is set, one gets to the room floors and finds a more cheerful color scheme (green,) but once again, a somewhat dowdy hallway leading to the rooms. There's no doubt that the Allegro is an old, old hotel, that was never completely renovated and it shows. The rooms were redone, but not the walls or ceilings of the hallways. While the rooms are large for an urban hotel, once again, like the lobby, they're cold and austere. Ours had 1960s style silver wallpaper with a pattern of huge rounded squares and absolutely no art work on the walls, flimsy cotton roman type shades and oversized, unattractive black cabinets for the TV, mini-bar, bedside consoles and desk. While the bathroom had new fixtures and a nice Speakman shower head, it was tiny. In fact, the sink was one of those tiny little ones that you occasionally see in miniscule powder rooms! Only one person could fit into the bathroom at anytime... So, would I recommend the Allegro? No. Only if you got an incredible 'deal' on a room there, would I recommend it.

The lobby is really nicely decorated and they serve wine and appetizers in the evening for all guests- a great bonus. If you join the Kimpton club you can get internet access for free. The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful. One of the elevators was broken so there were only 2 operating for all of the floors. I waited over 20 minutes with my luggage to to get the elevator to catch my plane. If I was traveling with lighter luggage I would have taken the stairs. I don't suspect this is a common problem so hopefully no one else will have to wait as long as I did.

The hotel is located about a block and a half to two blocks from the Washington/Wells train station. If you are flying to Chicago this station is a straight shot from Midway airport on the orange line which makes it very convenient and also affordable at just 2.25 per person. Travel time from Midway via the L train is approximately 30-40 minutes but it doesn't feel very long at all. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel from the bell staff, front desk staff, and restaurant staff were warm, friendly, and more than willing to answer any questions we have. I've come to expect great service from Kimpton hotels and this one did not disappoint. We had a double double room that faced the train station. While the room was not all that large it did not feel cramped at all. You could hear the train going by but it was not distracting and did not effect us when we slept - in fact, I quite enjoyed knowing the train was right outside our window. The decor was modern, geometric, and a bit more sparse compared to other Kimpton's I've stayed at. The beds were incredibly comfortable and both my mom and I slept great during our 2 night stay here. The bathroom was a bit smaller than other properties I've stayed at; however, it is nicely decorated and served it's purpose. We ate at the restaurant - 312 - for breakfast. While expensive (4.00 just for a glass of orange juice) the food was good - I had the french toast with bananas and it was delicious. I would have made a few different choices if I had it to over again but considering we were on a schedule our first full day in the city this option worked well for us. The servers were attentive though not overly friendly. Encore - the liquid lounge just off the ground level near the elevators was great. We enjoyed a couple drinks and split a margherita pizza our first night in town - all of which was very good. The staff was very friendly, engaged us in conversation on more than one occasion, and were very attentive while still allowing us a chance to relax, enjoy the atmosphere, and chat. Hotel Allegro, like other Kimpton properties, hosts a complimentary evening wine hour and has coffee/tea set up in mornings in the lobby. We attended one of the wine hours and enjoyed the coffee every morning. I would definitely recommend the Hotel Allegro to anyone traveling to Chicago. The location to the train, the theater district, and other great sites (we walked from the Sears/Willis tower back to the hotel) can not be beat. Not to mention the staff was very friendly and always makes you feel welcome.

It's a few blocks from shopping (Filene's Basement, Miracle Mile), the Art Institute, and Millennium Park. It was easy to catch a cab to Lincoln Park for another play and restaurants.

Our reservations were made last-minute, and it was a good thing I brought the printed confirmation because the hotel had no records of the 3 rooms we had reserved. I was the first of our party to check in, and had less than 1/2 hour to make it to another meeting 5 blocks away. Although the two ladies at the front desk couldn't find the reservation, they did give me a room and promised to contact the travel agent to clear up the confusion. It appears that the problem was resolved because the other two travelers had no problems when they checked in a few hours later. The rooms are small, and we (I was with my husband) were given a room with one full-size bed. The bathroom was tiny and the floor had water spots - at least I hope it was water given the close proximately to the toilet (the spots were very easy to see on the black tile). Otherwise, it was clean and nicely maintained. It did have an unusual square sink that was set slighty above the countertop, which was an unexpected change from the normal \"hotel\" bathroom sink. The stopper in the sink was closed and refused to open without being pried up. There was no lever to lift it and if it was the \"pop-up\" type (where you push down and it pops up), the pop-up function had ceased to work. Luckily I figured that out before I brushed my teeth and or I would have had to pry it up through a sink full of water and spit. After my meeting, I was dying of hunger and wanted to order some food, but found that we were missing the book with the room service menu. It was quickly delivered after a call to the front desk. Room service was right on time and the food was above average. We had to make a second call to the front desk because the TV refused to work. A maintenance man appeared shortly thereafter and was able to fix the problem. The bed was uncomfortable with a hump in the middle, which caused me to roll towards the edge of the bed all night. I definitely did not have a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. However, the other travelers in our group did not have an issue with their bed, so it may have been just my bed. Overall, I have stayed in far worse hotels. It was clean and was not over-priced. It would have been nicer not to have the three issues (no record of the reservation, no room service menu, TV not working), but all of the staff members we dealt with were courteous and the problems were quickly resolved.

I joined the Kimpton Club online before flying in order to get the perks of a free newspaper delivered daily to my door, free wifi, and $10.00 minibar credit although I had my doubts about being eligible due to my discount price. I also went during Lollapalooza weekend although I was going to Lolla I was worried about late night partying at the hotel since is was being used by the Lolla promoters in the Lolla package deal and I knew ahead of time the hotel was sold out. I arrived on Thursday and was allowed to check in early. I asked for a room on an upper level away from the elevators and the ice machine. I never heard any noise in the hallway or from the surrounding rooms. I got the NY Times delivered to my door daily, free wifi and the minibar credit. The Allegro is 1 block from the blue line train station that comes directly from the airport for $2.25 or you can buy a multiday pass which can save lots of money if you plan on using public transport. The trains are clean and comfortable if you don't go on at rush hour which can be very crowded and hot. The room was a good size for two of us. It had a queen bed, a desk with a comfy chair, a minibar, a large flat screen and a couple of bedside tables. The carpets looked very clean and the bed and linens were clean and very comfortable. The ac was wonderful, with no bad odors. The bathroom was clean and well appointed. I have stayed in much smaller rooms in Europe and Manhattan so I wouldn't call the room uncomfortably small. The lobby was beautiful and had several large areas to sit and relax with complimentary lemon ice water, ice tea, lemonade, coffee and ice coffee. Alas, there is no coffee maker in the room, but I didn't find it to be a hardship to go to the lobby for some of delicious coffee that was brewed up for the guests. On my first morning I didn't realize that the coffee dissappeared at 10 am so one of the desk people went to the back and brought me a wonderful cup of coffee. The complimentary wine hour from 5 to 6 pm daily is a pleasant way to wind down the day. Wonderful little morsels are provided to snack on during the wine hour. We loved the location in the theatre district. We did go to a Billy Elliott matinee and loved it. HotTix, a discount ticket seller is at the corner of Randolph and Michigan and they said they do get discount Billy Elliott tickets on Tuesday and Wednesday. We paid full price for balcony and it was well worth the price. The little tea shop next door to the theatre, the Argo, has wonderful before theatre quiche and salad plates that are very affordable. Although we had Lolla tix we spent a lot of time away from the Grant Park site. We were able to tour around on foot from the Allegro very easily. Millenium Park is a straight walk down Randolph, Riverwalk just about the same amount of time, a little longer to Mag Mile. We did take the bus to Devon Road, the largest Indian/Pakistani settlement in the USA I was told. It was like leaving the USA. I recommend it for daytime only. One place I do not recommend is The Navy Pier. Go only if you have little children since there is a ferris wheel, but even then it is a travesty of McDonalds, a large and awful Bubba Gump restaurant, several large trinket stores and a couple of other artery clogging fast food places. While on the subject of food, we did eat one dinner at the 312 Restaurant that is conncted to the hotel and it was a wonderful meal. I had halibut baked with a very good sauce and and we had the calamari, scallop and shrimp fritte appetizer with spicy marinara sauce. The martinis and wine were also delicious and the service was excellent. We had another wonderful meal at Gage Restaurant on Michigan Ave. across from Millenium Park. It was a little pricey, but memorable food, service, ambience and location. Okay, back to the hotel. What made this hotel so great besides all of the above mentioned, was the level of service and attitudes of every employee we encountered. Everyone was more than pleasant and at the same time so professional and efficient. Thank you desk staff, I wish I knew your names. Thank you Cori and Fidel who took such good care of our bags. Thanks to the housekeepers and thanks to the concierge who provided us with lots of directions and maps. I found this friendly pleasant attitude across the board of almost everyone I encounterd in Chicago. I have never been in any large city like it.

All the staff was very friendly and unstuffy. The rooms were quirky but interesting. Sort of an op illusion theme to disguise irregularities in the old structure. The bathrooms are teeny, but very clean. The beds are comfy and there is a good sized desk. Internet was free-perhaps because I signed up for the Klimpton's on-line club? The wine hour looked nice, and the piano is a nice touch. The only thing I can find fault with is that the walls are paper thin. I could hear normal conversations in the next room. The noise from the hallways was as bad. All in all, the wonderful staff, cleanliness, and ambiance more than made up for the occasional free entertainment from my neighbors.

I had never stayed at the Allegro but was very pleasantly surprised. I had read review on Trip Advisor and many had warned about the small rooms but I decided to try the hotel anyway. Yes, the room was small. Probably the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in...and the bath was small also, however, we did not come to Chicago to spend all our time in our hotel room. If there was a drawback to our stay, the size of the rooms would be the only thing worth mentioning. But again, we didn't spend much time in the room. Pros: ALL staff was MORE than accomodating and more than friendly. The decor....which I would call funky/trendy/mod was very cool and different. I typically like to stay in a hotel which offers a breakfast, but I didn't seem to mind that the Allegro didn't. They did have coffee and tea each morning in the lobby and tea and lemonade in the afternoon. I loved the tea with fresh mint! If you are a wine drinker (I'm not), they offered complimentary wine around 5 p.m. I saw where someone complained about the expensive parking. ALL parking is expensive in Chicago.... We did not park at the hotel...we had done some research online and found a garage a couple blocks away that was cheaper. Hotel and room were CLEAN!!!! Plush linens, plush bed. I can put up with a lot of things but I cannot stand a hotel room that isn't clean....and our room was pristine! The concierge was more than helpful with dining ideas and did an amazing job of recommending outstanding restaurants. I called her multiple times when I was out and about asking questions and she never seemed to mind even when I called her 3x in a 10 minute window. I loved the Aveda products and at one point needed more shampoo and conditioner. I called the front desk and I had more than I had asked for w/n minutes. I also had a problem with my remote (I thought it needed new batteries) and maintenance was very quick to bring me another one. However, when I opened the door to get the other remote, he saw that I had a bottle of water in front of the \"eye\" on the t.v. and suggested that might be the problem. It was...I felt like an idiot and gave him the remote that he'd just brought me back to him. Hotel was very close to State street shopping and Millenium and Grant parks...as well as the lake.

Unfortunately for us the couple next door decided to \"enjoy themselves\" for quite an extensive period of time, so I would not recommend coming here with your kids. Very awkward. This hotel does not have many rooms with 2 beds so I think it is better suited for couples. The parking is extremely expensive. We had somewhat of a disappointing experience with the concierge who sent us on a wild goose chase to find a dueling piano bar, which turned out to be some retro bar full of old people and no piano in sight. We decided to then go to a sports bar also recommended by the concierge to watch the fight. The bar was quite a bit out of the way and did not have the fight on.

There were a couple of downers - on arrival, there was only one person on reception, which seems to double as concierge so despite the fact there were three of us waiting to check in, the receptionist had to deal with a guest that wanted to talk and talk about restaurant options in the area. Annoying and a bit selfish, if you ask me. At check-in they reminded me that I have a $10 mini-bar credit as a regular Kimpton client which was nice, because not all the hotels bother to tell you this. Room was very nice - in fact the decor throughout the hotel was pretty good - very fresh, not overwelmingly hip or anything. Bed comfortable, bathroom decent size. Another pleasant surprise was the restaurant - again, I don't generally have positive experiences of hotel restaurants but we were hungry and didn't want to go far. 312 was very nice - my colleague said it was probably the best bit of swordfish he'd ever had!

They gave us soap and towels when we saw them in the hall and they are very polite and professional. -Free 24 hour Fitness Center Cons- -Rooms are a little small but then again were in downtown CHicago. Bathrooms were small but they had MARBLE finishes which looked nice and the towles were very absorbent. But yea, I did wish the bathroom was bigger and that the doors to the bathroom would close completely because they were like these weird closet looking doors and even when they are close you can kinda see whats ont he inside which can be embarassing. -Parking Cost - $36 overnight but its across the street and apparrantly thats not so bad in Downtown CHicago. its $44 if you do valet.

This was our second time, our fourth at a Kimpton property. Overall, this hotel is very good value. Let's start with the upsides. The place is extremely clean and the staff is over-the-top courteous and helpful. There was free hot chocolate and hot cider and cookies from 2-4pm, served in a beautiful lobby, that just made it all seem fun. Then there's the traditional 5pm wine reception. And FREE wireless internet. And an \"L\" station is right around the corner. Location: a lot of people think they want to stay on North Michigan and pay a premium to be nearer the \"shopping\". But the big Macy's is downtown. Moreover, many of the best restaurants are in the west loop; in fact, many are on West Randolph, same as Allegro. And we went to the Cadillac Palace for a show, and it's attached to the hotel. So don't pick North Michigan without thinking. We decided better to take one cab (or train) to North Michigan one day rather than take a cab to the loop for dinner and shows. There were a few downsides. The rooms are really very small. There is no way this could be more than a 3 to 3.5 star hotel because of room size and configuration. Fancy hotels have bathrooms 2-3 times the size of the Allegro's. Our bellman had to go to the front desk TWICE with our room keys til we got one that worked. And front desk said they'd have a Tribune sent to my room in the morning, but they didn't. These are mostly trifles, but they remind you this is not a Ritz Carlton or Oberoi. We like Kimptons: like the glitz, the deco feel, the friendly staff, even the pets. And I got this hotel on Expedia for really cheap--$87 per room--during the holiday week. It was well, well worth that tariff. Might have got something even cheaper on Priceline, but I wanted this hotel and I wanted two rooms (which they gave me adjoining). I would always recommend considering Kimpton as a good value choice that is nicer and cooler than Embassy Suites or Sheraton or even Hyatt but much less expensive than Conrad or Ritz or Trump.

We loved it from the moment we arrived. We were able to check in early which was great, and we had a late check-out. Althought the room was not huge, it was more than adequate, and the decor was adorable. Everything worked as it should- great water pressure and good hot and cold. People in other reviews had complained about the size of the bathroom and the french-style doors, but we thought it was fine. The bathroom was really cute with black marble floors, and carrera marble counter and subway tile in the shower. The Aveda toiletries were lovely. Everything was spotlessly clean. There was also a great magnifiying makeup mirror. We had two closets which while a little shallow, had ample room. The evening wine reception from 5-6 in the lobby was wonderful. Several choices of wine and delicious canapes each night. You don't need to dress up, and it was fun to chat with other guests. We had the package with free cocktails in their lounge, which was very nice. Drinks and food were excellent. Quite a popular place. The entire hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and we loved the decor in the lobby and public rooms.The front desk couldn't have been more helpful. They gave us directions to every place we wanted to go, including a Google map for a place they weren't familiar with. Everyone was so nice, especially Samellia and Fidel. We were also given a $15 voucher to use anywhere in the hotel when I discovered that they no longer offer free coffee in the morning. We used it for a lovely Continental breakfast at their Cameo. The location was very close to all the theatres, and it was easy to get around by bus. It was also easy to take the blue line train to and from O'Hare for $2.25. We bought the 3-day CTA pass at the airport, and it's good for trains and busses. There is not much around the hotel for buying snacks or wine, etc. The CVS around the corner carries lots of everything, including alcoholic beverages, but it closes at 7pm on Saturdays. The hotel is in a very safe neighborhood- we walked five blocks from where a friend is staying on Michigan Ave at 2:30 am, and had no problems. We can't say enough good things about this hotel.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at other hotels in the city, but I wanted to stay at a Kimpton Hotel this time, and the complimentary wine hour surely helped with the decision. The hotel is located a block from the L that goes to O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare Airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get off at the Clark stop and walk a couple of blocks south. The entrance is a bit confusing at first because the check in desk is actually on the second floor. But if you need help with your baggage, there are always proactive bellboys that are willing to help out. Check was pretty quick, and we were lucky there was a room available for early check in. When we went into our room, I was expecting a very tiny room. The size of the room was actually decent. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is wonderful, the bed is very comfortable (I remember sinking into the bed and dozing off within five seconds), the television is pretty large, and the bathroom was a decent size. One good thing about this hotel is that you can hook up your iPod to the radio and play your music. I guess the walls are pretty thick because we had the music pretty loud while we were getting ready to go out and no one complained. In fact, we never heard people walking around the hallway at night. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, and State Street shopping, city hall (Daley Plaza), and Michigan Avenue are just a few blocks away. The location is great for the L because the Washington and Clark stops are just a few blocks away. Our favorite part of the hotel was the wine hour. The first night there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of people in the lobby, so they had flatbread pizza to go with the wine. They also had chestnuts and warm apple cider. The second night, there were a lot more people, so they only put out a variety of cheeses. The people serving the wine are very friendly and attentive, and they remembered the type of wines we were drinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if there was only one type of red and white. Check out took a while since everyone was checking out at the same time. We left our bags with the bellboy since we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready to leave Chicago yet.

The bellman and the evening concierge were TOP-NOTCH. And the complimentary wine hour.....fabulous! After reading reviews ahead of time about how small the rooms were, I was a little nervous, considering we were bringing our 65-lb. dog with us and worried we'd not have enough room. But the room was great! Plenty of room for our stuff, not to mention our dog, her pillow, food/drink and her toys! I had two great nights of sleep in that bed! The bathroom was a tad small, but the shower was heavenly. Now onto the things we didn't care for: The woman who checked us in didn't explain the amenities (the wine hour, if there was a breakfast or free coffee in the lobby, etc.) I had to ask about all of this. And I knew we were supposed to get a doggie goody bag when we checked in. On the way up to our room after check-in, I remembered this and mentioned it in front of the bellman. He offered to go back down and get it, but my husband ended up going back for it. Also, it makes sense, from a liability standpoint, to not have housekeeping clean a room when there's a dog (or other animal) in it without the owners present. However, we were not informed of this and came back from an afternoon of shopping with our room still uncleaned. I had to call and make a request for our room to be cleaned and we had to leave the room, with our dog, for another few hours. I also requested turn-down service and when we returned to our room, it had not been done. We got a call about 20 minutes later to tell us they couldn't do it with the dog in the room. So we just canceled it. Again, not a huge deal in the scheme of things, but if would've been nice to know this when I made the initial request. The hotel promotes a \"grassy knoll\" four blocks from the hotel as someplace you can take your pet to do its duty. When we arrived there, my husband and I started laughing. It was barely a grassy anything! After that we started taking her to Grant Park which was 6 blocks away and while it was December (and freezing), it was a much better place to take your dog. I'm not sure the hotel can do much about creating a place for its furry hotel guests to do their thing, but it could be something to think about!

A suite, great seating area with 60's style couches and light fixtures, an inroom bar, flat panel HD tv (didn't work great) and a table for sitting and one for office work. The bedroom was large with a Kind sized bed (very very comfy), high end pillows, sheets and mattresses, huge armoire and HD TV. Bedroom views were just of other buildings, so nothing special, but they did have great \"blackout\" blinds. The bath was awesome with a giant, two person whirlpool tub.

The hotel is right next to the Palace Theater and Chicago City Hall and has a number of services nearby and is just a short walk from State Street. It was very conveniently accessed from both the Kennedy Expressway and the L, which was two blocks away at Clark/Lake. Self-parking is about $35 a day in the ramps nearby ($49 valet), but you can save yourself a few bucks parking at Grant Park ($29) and walking the six blocks. The lobby and registration are upstairs one floor from the street, with plenty of valet and bell help at street level. Once checked in, we headed up to our room on the 8th floor, only to find out it was a double. After deciding against being Ozzie & Harriet for the weekend, we went back down and were quickly changed to a king without any fuss. As other posts have mentioned, the rooms are a bit on the small side and a little more like what you might find in Europe. We thought our room was clean and that good use was made of what space was available so that we didn't feel cramped. We had two small closets to hang clothes and a three-drawer dresser. The bed was also very comfortable. Our room was on the northwestern corner of the building, which sits at the corner of Wells and Randolph. The western leg of the Loop L runs on Wells, but we really didn't have too much trouble with noise from that or the street below. My only possible complaint with the room was with the mini-bar refrigerator, which cycled almost constantly, after which there was a audible \"pop\" of the condenser.

One of my traveling companions is a real Kimpton 'afficionado\" and insisted that during our stay in Chicago we stay at Kimpton Hotels. His favorite, the Hotel Monaco was prohibitively expensive for the first leg of our trip so we decided on the Allegro which was new to all of us. I arrived a day ahead of my traveling friends and checked into a room that was more spacious than I expected after reading these reviews. I mean it wasn't the Taj Mahal, but it was easy to move around for the most part, and the furniture was well placed. The check in clerk kindly let me know that there were two closets and the one with the hangers in it was behind a door that looked like a connecting room. With that advice, no closet problems. The bathroom is indeed pintsized, but that is mitigated by nice Aveda products, a good shower fixture with good pressure, and a cute little modern sink area. The bed was comfortable. My clock radio was an IPod dock which I really appreciate when traveling to recharge mine, and the desk provided a good and needed work space as I brought some office work to get done while waiting for my friends to arrive. The desk also had an outlet carousel which I appreciated for my laptop and phone charging. I joined the Kimpton \"In Touch\" loyalty program to gain free wireless internet access. Even the application process is kind of fun as you answer questions about your preferences and priorities when traveling. I didn't have much of a view-being surrounded on all sides by other tall office buildings, but it wasn't unpleasant. The decor was nice and modern. It was a comfortable place to sleep, work and relax between excursions. Even the minibar had a good wine to enjoy before bed. The hotel bar was very nice, the food and drinks good, reasonably priced and served by friendly professionals. Employees were courteous and helpful. Although it isn't in the center of the touristy part of the city, we found restaurants, bars, a breakfast cafe, shops and Starbucks within a few blocks' walk. They also have a wine hour in the late afternoon which is a nice touch. It is the opposite of the \"old money\" feel of the established, larger hotels such as the Intercontinental, Fairmont, etc, nor is it a cookie cutter business traveler's hotel. It seems designed for a younger clientele. I'm no spring chicken, but I felt very comfortable there. All my needs were met, and so for the price, it was a good choice for me. Although I didn't bring a pet along, I saw some pretty cute little doggie guests in the elevators.

We spent maybe 8 hrs a day in the room. I stayed in 1403, and my room was large, the bed was adequate, and the flat screen was large. I got the great rate from Travelzoo.com. 2. The parking is horrible, no really it is.. They wanted $49 for valet and $45 for self parking. The city of Chicago has privatized all the parking structures and meters so don't waste time looking for a cheaper parking garage. My relative who lives in the city told me to park at Union Station, which was $10 for 24hrs on the weekend, and $20 other times. The first night we took a cab to the hotel and it was $6, and the other nights we walked, it's really not far, maybe 5 blocks. So, either, way it's way cheaper and was worth it for me to not pay more for parking then for the room. 3. Basically, a good value for the price and the location is great.

The wine happy hour from 5 to 6pm was nice and we made sure to hit it both nights. Lots of places to sit in the various parts of the lobby. Parking is typically Chicago expensive as valet is $48 and self park was $45/night. Blame King Richard II (the current Mayor Daley) for selling out the city parking rights. Even the 2 hour limit street parking meters are now up to $3/hour. The TV is a nice, new 37\" HD capable set. (In fact, almost the exact same model LG as I have at home.)

The mattress and bedding was comfortable. Falling to sleep was very easy. The walls seemed a bit thin as we could clearly hear the couple in the next room.

One fabulous feature that I was looking forward to taking advantage of was their yoga package - they give you a yoga mat to borrow and they have a yoga channel on their tv. Unless you enjoy doing yoga on a bed, you will not have room. I had a king size room and I, a 5'11\" woman, could not have done yoga in the open space. Second, there were only 2 pillows on my king size bed. So, instead of being able to prop myself up comfortably on this nice big bed, I was stuck with a crook in my neck. Third, the staff are very quick and short with the guests. I tried asking for directions to a sushi restaurant. I ended up going 6 blocks in the wrong direction thanks to their directions. In the morning I tried to order room service for breakfast and I was told that there was a 45 minute wait so I would be better off taking advantage of the continental breakfast. This sounded great to me - a complimentary continental breakfast would be perfect! I showered (took literally 3 minutes to get warm water - never got hot) and packed and went down to the lobby. The \"continental breakfast\" was 4 pastries, 4 pieces of fruit, and a woman \"guarding'\" the coffee. I thought, okay, well, they're going to prepare my coffee for me - okay. Nope - I was charged $2.67 for a cup of coffee. I was completely baffled by this. They have a complimentary wine hour in the lobby at night and they can't provide coffee in the morning? Absolutely ridiculous. When I mentioned my disappointments to the young man who checked me out he said that I should have said something to them and they would have done something for me yet he did not even offer to do anything upon my check out.

We are generally fans of Kimpton hotels - we like the decorations and style that most of their hotels exhibit. Hotel Burnham in Chicago is a particular favorite, for example. We found Hotel Allegro to be a typical but unfortunately underwhelming Kimpton. First, if you're in Chicago to see a show, Hotel Allegro has a decent enough location - it's walking distance to the Ford Theater and the Palace is right next door. There are restaurants, pharmacies, shopping and more in the immediately neighborhood. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. Par for a Kimpton hotel, the room was just large enough for a bed and a small desk. The bathroom featured a tiny sink and a decent shower. It was clean and had a modern feel. We found it strange that there we only two tiny pillows on the giant King bed (and none to be found anywhere else in the room.) It had a large, flat-screen TV (although we never turned it on) and strangely, it had two closets - one tiny, angled one where the iron and hangers were located - and a larger empty one with a shelf and rack to which we moved the hangers in order to unpack. Also par for Kimpton, the hotel was noisy. It is my opinion that rude guests are attracted to Kimpton's frequent discounts. Hotel Allegro had it's share on Friday night - about 2AM, noisy guests returning from the bars were shouting and laughing in the hall. We heard numerous slamming doors. At 7AM the clock alarm in the vacant room next to ours started blaring (it was REALLY loud). We notified the front desk but apparently they didn't do anything because it went off on Sunday morning at the same time. Considering how obvious it was on the face of the digital clock that an alarm was set, it's disappointing that housekeeping doesn't include this in their to-do list to check when a visitor checks out. The room was very clammy the first night. Even though the air conditioning was running, we found the bed and air to have a heavy, damp feeling which was uncomfortable. The second night, however, everything was fine. Because Kimpton tends to renovate old hotels, it may be that the outside weather (which was very humid) was leaking in - but this was the first time we've experienced that in a hotel with air conditioning. Also, we were extremely disappointed with parking fees -- $44/night! This isn't necessarily Hotel Allegro's fault - we made a point to check out prices at other hotels and generally it seems everyone has raised their nightly rates. That said, one block down the street was a public ramp that offered parking for $32/night. We self-parked and ended up saving a bunch of money since we took our car out early on Sunday - we paid $12 for the second night which is a real deal. Walking one block with our luggage to save $40 was well worth it. So, our stay at Hotel Allegro was a mixed bag. We liked the location and the staff. We generally liked our room although the hotel was noisy at times and was clammy one night. We got a great deal compared to other hotels in the area - so it's easier to look past the problems. If we had the choice, we would probably stay at Hotel Burnham over Hotel Allegro but if another good deal popped-up for our frequent visits to Chicago, we'd certainly consider this hotel again.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cgood location, good room, good rate and the tiniest bathroom\u201d", "Author": "labguy", "ReviewID": "UR19279563", "Content": "Our upgrade king room was very spacious, but the bathroom sink area was so small that there didn't seem to be any room for water glasses, which were not provided.

I am sorry to report that I was disappointed by what I found. For every improvement there are several setbacks. For instance, the new bathtubs and shower surrounds are a vast improvement over the cheap plastic enclosures that were in place before, but in an attempt to make the bathrooms look bigger they installed tiny, doll-house sized sinks and removed every inch of counter space. If you need a spot to store your toothpaste, deodorant and hair brush, you have two options: on the floor of the bathroom or on the floor of the hallway right outside the bathroom. And since there is no counterspace, there are no glasses anywhere to be found. If you want a glass of tap water you'll have to order it from room service. Want to hang up your clothes? Pack light. They replaced the lateral closet hanger bar with two, feeble short ones that stick out towards you from the back of the closet wall. Two-thirds of the closet is completely unusable. This is progress? Want to plug in your laptop? Good luck. Decide whether you want to unplug a lamp, the clock radio or the TV. The wifi signal was week too, hovering predominantly on a low signal that made sending an email almost impossible. The new decor was a big disappointment too. The warm, vibrant colors have been replaced with an icy pallette of blues, grays and silvers. It's a bit like staying in a mosoleum. The chest front featuring what looks like the scrawlings of a two year old and mirrored, glass desktop with blotches of what look like battery acid are more jarring than soothing. Did an interior designer actually get paid for this job? One aspect that the Allegro did enhance is their price gouging. Want to print out a boarding pass? Cough up $5.95 plus $0.49 per page ($1.49 for color). Want a small pot of coffee delivered to your room in the morning? A $10 bill won't cover it. Need to park your car overnight? Add $44 to your tab. I've stayed at The Allegro for all of my previous stays in Chicago but will be looking elsewhere for my next trip.

I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels in DC, and I must say that the Allegro in Chicago has become my favorite Kimpton hotel since our stay a few weeks ago. The Rooms: We stayed in a King Suite and was pleased with EVERYTHING in the room. It was rather large...not sure what rooms other guests that have posted reviews stayed in but this room was great. We DID NOT hear noise from other rooms. We DID NOT hear the L. We had two large flat screen tvs (one in the living area and one in the sleeping area), plus two closets, a desk, a sofa, and plenty of seating. The iHome radios are a nice touch---you can listen to your ipod on it. I personally didn't have an issue with counter space in the bathroom. I simply moved the tissue holder, etc. to the space under the sink. My husband used the area to the left of the sink, I used the right. No problems there. The tub was a jacuzzi tub so no problems there. Lastly, the beds were nice, comfortable...you could sink into them. The Service: We enjoyed the wine reception every night and took full advantage of it! Why not, it's free! And as for the wifi, ours was free with the room. We also ordered room service for breakfast and it was on time and yummy! I can see some other guests' complaint about not having a coffee maker in the room. But that didn't bother us at all...it might if you are a business traveler. And Mark (the concierge) helped us with EVERYTHING (he also got us a good seats at Frontera Grill and the Signature Room that weekend). One day, we missed having our room cleaned---but as we left our room around 2pm, we we asked by the staff if we would like our room cleaned (of course we would) and when we came back in an hour it was spotless. We even got a follow up visit to make sure the room was cleaned and met our approval. The Hotel/Location: We thought the renovation of the hotel was fabulous. What a cool lobby. And you can't beat the location. We caught the train into Union Station so the walk was 15 minutes tops. We also saw the play Wicked while we were there and it's right down the street. Perfect! Plus we walked all the way up to The Water Tower, so IMO, it's kinda close to a lot of things. Still away from the Michigan Ave. foot traffic, but still accessible to may things.

The one day I got there in time to get it, it seemed like they were doing me a favor! I wanted to tea bags for my tea...can't have it! If I wanted a refill on my coffee...sorry...used up your free coffee already! Although I didn't have the free breakfast coupon I did see some others...the offer was you can have one pastry, one fruit, and one juice. It was controlled from behind the counter so you couldn't take a look at what you wanted...or get seconds. Heck...they even ran out of stuff so some people left hungry! The conceirge was helpful. Gym was nice! With no free breakfast, nickle and diming on computer use and other small things, and just the unsincere service I was not pleased with the 4-star hotel.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cAnother great Kimpton\u201d", "Author": "texashappygal", "ReviewID": "UR17373535", "Content": "This was our third stay at a Kimpton, and the hotel chain continues to deliver.

I am glad to see the weird pink/orange color gone, it's been replaced with a blue/brown scheme - much more restful.

There was plenty of room in the bathroom to put a larger vanity or even a shelf, not sure why it was set up this way. Bed was comfortable, great linens as usual, plenty of pillows and I loved the new plasma tvs in the room.

While we also experienced some lapses in service and inconveniences, overall we had a good experience here. First, the good: beautiful Art Deco designs everywhere; I felt like I was staying in the \"Rhapsody In Blue\" segment of the Fantasia movie. The bed was very comfortable and the lighting good; water pressure was fine. The windows are double-paned and as a result the traffic noises (and construction across the street) were much muted. For those complaining about the lack of coffeemakers in the room, the hotel does provide complimentary coffee/tea in the lobby every morning from 6:00-10:00 a.m. There is also a wine hour (sadly, no cheeses) every day at 4:00 p.m. at which time we saw plenty of guests. Take time to hang out in the lobby; it's spectacularly beautiful even if Art Deco isn't your thing. The neighborhood is much quieter at night than north of the river (ie. Magnificent Mile) being primarily a business district and is easily accessible by the El (just a short, safe walk away) and Metra to the suburbs (about 15-20 mins walk depending on which station you need to access). While this might be a turn-off to some, for us we were glad not to be fighting crowds on the sidewalks all the time. Yes, the vacant lot across the street is not exactly picturesque, but overall we appreciated the location for what it was--close to pretty much everything, and the opportunity to see a city in transition (there's construction going on all around). We chose not to rent a car and were glad we didn't; there are plenty of self-parking lots around but most don't allow overnight parking, and it seemed pretty steep (and unnecessary) to park at the hotel. I also appreciated the \"green\" aspect of the hotel with its separate trash/recycling cans in the room. The not-so-good: I would agree with the previous poster about the dearth of a good variety of restaurants open on weekend nights or late in general. Despite the fact that there is a theatre next door and several (the Chicago, the Oriental) in the immediate neighborhood, we had a very rough time finding anything open beyond McDonalds at 9:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. Fortunately for us, we found Ronny's Original Steakhouse (near the Clark/Lake CTA station) which had phenomenal barbeque, but it took awhile to find it. (Incidentally, there are a few pizza places within walking distance--Giordano's up the street and Pizanos' on Madison--but they generally don't stay open that late. Also if you like Persian food there's a great place called Reza's on Orleans a short cab ride away.) Our flight was delayed and by the time we got to the hotel it was after 3:00 a.m.; the wake-up call we requested for the next day never came (good thing we set an alarm ourselves). We also waited about 45 minutes for a bag of ice to be brought to us (as there is no ice machine). The rooms and especially the bathrooms are quite small but seeing how it is an older hotel it's to be expected. If we had been staying longer than just a few days (and had luggage rather than living out of carry-on backpacks) it would've been pretty hard to store our clothes, as there seemed to be only a pair of small drawers for storage and a tiny closet. We appreciated the Allegro for its location, its theme design and the efforts it took to make us comfortable.

Who wants to sit on the edge of a bed to have a conversation? That is what you have to do at the Allegro because there is only one desk chair in the whole room - even though there is room for another one. We thought the decor was cold and unwelcoming, there wasn't enough surface space to put 'things', leaving guests to totally live out of their opened suitcases, which had to lay on the floor because there was no other place to put them. The bathroom was very small with no counterspace. There was no coffee maker and we never found any drinking glasses. In the closet was a leopard print number that you could purchase for about $50. Never saw anything like that before. We had a horrible view of crumbled buildings and we noticed that there were hardly any guests to be seen in the common areas. On the plus side - we arrived at 7:30 a.m. and they let us have access to our room at that time. We figured that we would have to store our luggage until 1:00 pm but, luckily, that wasn't the case.

Sometimes I make requests (such as pillows or pet bowls) and they take a long time to be fulfilled. Sometimes it takes multiple reminders, and sometimes it takes me to be proactive by going downstairs to the front desk. They certainly seem to be improving everytime I stay here though. and if anything does go wrong, the staff does its best to remediate the issue, an effort which I am appreciative of. My biggest issue with the hotel is its thin walls. Of my stays here, I've heard neighbors' passionate nights to phone conversations, and I'm not even a light sleeper. My worst experience was when my neighbor decided to wake up to Josh Groban 45 minutes before I wanted to wake up.

We had a glass one night and while not very good wine, it was free. The room was nicely decorated and did not seem worn/dirty as others have complained about.

Cons: There was not too much open in the area surrounding the hotel in the way of restaurants, day or night. If you are looking for restaurants or shops nearby there did not seem to be many, at least that were open. Based on this, the first night there we were very tired after touring the city all day, and it was pretty late, so we decided to get room service. Big mistake. We weren't expecting anything great but the food was so bad. We considered complaining which we really should have because it was practically inedible. On top of that, the person who brought the food did not mention that 18% gratuity was included, even when my husband asked about writing in a tip. He just told him he could go ahead and write it in. We wound up tipping 40%. We realized it shortly after but didn't bother to complain, even though again we probably should have. We also should have read the menu more carefully but still this experience left us feeling pretty old about the place as we spent $60 for horrible bar food and felt cheated by the staff. Only other negative was the view out of our window was of an empty lot/construction site which was pretty ugly. To sum it up, I wouldn't stay here again when visiting Chicago as there are many other options, but I also don't regret staying here. They are in the process of renovating rooms so I anticipate they will be pretty nice once this is done. I think it's worth a stay here for someone new to the city if you can get a good rate. I am pretty picky about hotels and wasn't unhappy here.

We got this hotel through a Priceline bid for a decent rate for the holiday weekend About us, we are in our mid-twenties and we consider ourselves not too fussy when it comes to accommodations. Our focus when staying somewhere leans more towards location and cleanliness and less towards things like room size and decorations. Overall, The Hotel Allegro has some great things about it, but it does have several areas in which management could focus on trying to improve upon. Getting There: This hotel is real convenient if you happen to be flying into Midway Airport. We try to use public transportation as much as possible when traveling, and it is nice because this hotel is about 2 blocks from the 'El' Station (Orange Line). It costs only $2/person to take the \"El\" from the airport, a great value when compared to taking a cab. Location: Location is pretty decent. It is in the northern-loop area of Chicago and this part of town is pretty quite in terms of restaurants, bars and clubs compared to the North Michigan Avenue Area, but it is safe. it is about a 10-15 minute walk to N. Michigan where most of the shopping occurs, and about a 35-30 minute walk to Navy Pier. Being in the theatre district, It is also convenient to all the theatres. Check-In: When you first walk into the lobby, it is everything the website portrays. Nice high ceilings, contemporary decorations and furniture, and fire place. We arrived at 11 am and our room was not ready yet. The front-desk staff said to that there is a guaranteed check-in time at 3pm. They did take our bags for us until we could check-in, so we set out to get some lunch and see some of the city. When we returned to the hotel after 3pm to get our room key, this is were the first negative thing occurred. There was a line of about 40 people in the lobby, with only 2 employees checking people in. Despite the check-in time of 3pm, many guests were being turned down saying their rooms were not ready. Many of these guests had dinner plans and theatre tickets for that evening and they needed to get to a room to prepare for their night. The manager came out to make an announcement to all the guests waiting in line. He offered an excuse saying that there was some renovations going on that next day and the housekeeping staff had a hard time preparing the rooms in time. The excuse was weak to me, because what difference does it make if there was renovations going on when compared to any other time where there may be full occupancy at the hotel, the rooms still need to be cleaned for check-in. ahh nevermind. The part that was frustrating is that the manager did nothing to compensate those who could not get rooms. Fortunately, we were lucky enough to have our room ready, so we took our key and went up to the 7th floor where we had a deluxe room with a king size bed. The Room: When the elevator doors opened to our floor, the first thing that we noticed was the strong smell of cigarette smoke. I was baffled at this because their website says the hotel is non-smoking. I thought maybe the smell was the result of several years of patrons smoking, but one time when were getting off of the elevator, there were two guests smoking right by the elevator door! I went on the 8th floor (on above us) to get ice, and it seemed to smell a lot better on that floor for whatever reason. We were able to cope with this, so we didn't ask to have our room changed, but you may want to check with them to ensure your room is on a non-smoking floor. As for other details of the room. The room is worn-down some and the decorations are a bit on the tacky side; however, it was clean (Despite the scent of cigarette smoke). The appearance of the room didn't bother us so much, but for those more particular travelers, this may be an issue. The most noticeable thing is that the room is on the smaller size, again this is an old hotel built in the 1920's, and the rooms weren't designed like the chains that many Americans are use to. Next, the bathroom is VERY small, but it was clean. The shower pressure/temperature was fine and the Aveda personal care products was a bonus. As for the size of the room and bathroom, we were fine with this because we didn't spend much time in the room, but if size is an issue don't book here. Also, it is a bit louder than most hotels, so if you have noisy neighbors and/or you are a light sleeper, I can see how you could complain about this place. One more negative as that the air conditioner was leaking onto the floor on our last night. The bed, linens, and pillows are very comfortable. We had no problems sleeping here. There is a nice desk/workstation where we setup our laptop and used the FREE wireless network (nice perk). Here is where the website embellishes a bit about the room. The TV is not a flat panel TV like I thought, instead it is a normal TV, it just has a flat screen instead of a rounded one. The \"Sony Sound System,\" that the website says you get is nothing more than a small boom-box. Good things about this hotel: Our favorite part of our stay at this hotel was the free Wine/Beer hour from 5pm-6pm every night. We never missed this, it is a great time to get a few drinks in you prior to heading out on the town for dinner/drinks. Very nice perk to staying here and the wine and beer they have is not too bad. Say hello to Willie the bartender at this event if you attend. The management does make a lot of effort into making themselves visible. You see them at the Wine hour, you see them in the lobby, we even seen them at a coffee bar they set up on our floor. So if there is something wrong, it seems pretty easy to tell someone who can do something about it. Check-Out: Check-out is at 12pm. We checked out and they held our bags for us until it was time to head back to the airport. Check-out was uneventful. OVERALL: Overall the hotel was OK for the price. It is worn down, in need of some updates in the rooms, but despite of these issues minor issues, its great location and personable hotel staff balance out some of the negatives. I don't think I would stay here again, but I wouldn't be too upset if Priceline put me into this hotel.

I booked the room for 4 people and even paid a little extra - $249.00 per night thinking that I would get a larger rooms/suites. Let me tell you how small my room was - 2 double beds tight up against each wall with a 3 1/2 ' desk/nightstand in between the beds. The room also had only a 19\" TV in an armoire. Very, very small bathroom, pedestal sink - with a small shelf above with hardly any room to put makeup or toiletries. This room was described as being \"art deco\" and it really wasn't except for a couple lamps. It was just shabby and in need of some \"life\". The worst part - My room had a locked adjoining room door. This door was not sound proof at all. I constantly heard my neighbors TV or their conversations and could even heard them using the bathroom and the loud flush of their toilet. I had to leave my TV on low vaolume all night long just to drown out the noise. Somehow my room didn't get cleaned during my 2 night stay - that was OK though since my expectations were now so low. We made our own beds and just requested towels and toiletries. To be fair, the hotel is clean, in a fun area and has pleasant employees. It has a grand lobby, restaurant and wine/beer reception.

Our main priority was location as we wanted to make the most of Chicago while we were there. Kimpton has 3 hotels I think in Chicago and certainly when we were searching for a room this one was the cheapest. First of all the downside, the rooms are beginning to show their age and although our room had a decent view over the Loop our friend's room had a brick wall directly outside the window making it very gloomy and dark. I can also confirm what other reviews have said that the size of the rooms are more to a UK standard than US. The storage room and hanging facilities (for clothes - not people) seem to have been given up for a full size ironing board which is probably the most frustrating part of the room we had (1727), meant to have a word with them about this but forgot. The carpet was slightly shabby but everything was very clean and tidy and as far as we're concerned that's the main thing in any hotel. The staff are brilliant and on the couple of occasions we needed them to sort something out they did so immediately and with a smile. Our friends were moved to another room and the tap washer that went in our room was mended promptly. The restaurant attached to the hotel (312) has a good menu and the food is well cooked. Can't say the service was brilliant anywhere we went in Chicago and speedwise this was no different but the waiters are friendly and everyone is happy to oblige at this hotel. The Upside - location, location, location! Right in the theatre district next to the Cadillac Palace hotel, max 20 mins walk from the Chicago Cultural Center (get yourself a FREE Chicago Greeter and get a personalised tour of Chicago). 20 mins from Millenium Park and about 30 mins stroll to the House of Blues and the river Architecture Tour (do this!). Just a final note - if you don't like the colour orange this hotel may not be the one for you as the rooms are VERY orange.

I was told this hotel was a few blocks away, but boy what a difference those few blocks make! I was travelling on a business trip and was joined in Chicago by 79 year old mother. When we arrived there was no one to help with luggage--no one at the front door at all. Since the Lobby is one flight up--yes, there are elevators--we had to manage the luggage ourselves. We NEVER saw someone at the door during the two nights we were there. No one to help with cabs nothing. Apparently there was someone during the evening but he was busy getting cabs for the people at the Theatre next door. The staff was nice although they had trouble finding the reservation and did not know that I was a member of Kimpton's loyalty program and I had to give them my number twice. Our room was nice but had not been cleaned properly. There were many takeout containers in the fridge, garbage in the wastepaper baskets--including food. The desk hadn't been wiped down and was covered with something sticky. When I went down to let them know thay said they would take care of it and we went out to shop. When we returned, the fridge had been cleaned but the bathroom (which we hadn't seen) had empty beer cans in the sink and the tub was filthy! Fortunately we went out for dinner I stopped at the desk to let them know and they did take care of it although the desk was never wiped. Made me feel the room was rather dingy. My main concern with this hotel is the area. The hotel used to be a big tourist hotel as it is next to a Theatre. After the Theatre gets out for the evening, all the cabs are tied up for about a half and hour and then the area gets creepy--lots of homless wandering around within this block. Honestly I felt the area was unsafe. Two other business colleague--one travelling from London also stayed here at the same time for the same meeting and one, a woman travelling alone, actually checked out early and went to another hotel. The other, an older English gentleman (who travels all over the world) remarked that he felt that the neighborhood was run down as well and he was disappointed that there was no one at the hotel front door. We made it a point to share cabs back. It was also a bit noisy as the walls are a bit thin so banging doors when people get back for the night and in the early am are the norm. As I was one of the people going in and out it didn't bother me but I could see how people not travelling on business would be bothered.

I was travelling on business and had early meetings on 2 of the 3 mornings that I was at the Allegro, meaning that I was forced to eat my breakfast at the coffee bar in the lobby, from plastic plates and paper cups.

This was my first time ever in Chicago. The hotel is easily accessible by the El Train from O'Hare. When I got off the train at the stop downtown I was a little confused. However I found the hotel without too much hassle. Probably about 2 blocks from the station. You can't miss the hotel. It has big, bright lights. Once you walk in, you take the elevator or stairs to the lobby located on the second floor. The lobby is beautiful. Nice contemporary feel. However the lobby music was a bit too loud for my taste. I had to wait in line to check-in but once I got to the desk, check-in was fast and efficient. Took the elevators to my room. Nice elevator music. The hallways have a a retro touch. I got to my room and was impressed. It wasn't anything too special but it was nicer than the average hotel room. My room was a good size. The view was nice too. The decor is quirky. The bathroom is small but it did the job for me. I could see that it might be a problem if you have more than two people staying in the room. Aveda products were nice. The bed was very nice. The pillows were heavenly. I absolutely loved them. I slept very well. After settling down, I went downstairs and asked where I could get some toiletries. There is a Walgreens around the corner. Very convient. There is also a 7-11. So if you don't want to pay the high priced items in the room then just walk around to the corner. The Cadillac Theater is right next to the hotel so I imagine they get a lot of theater buisness. I didn't eat in the resturant or get room service so I can't comment on those two items. There were no noise problems outside or inside the hotel during my stay. Water temperature and pressure were fine. I didn't interact too much with the staff but they seemed nice whenever I saw them. TV was an older model but it did the job. Desk was good size. Overall I liked my stay. The only issue I have is the molds of the room. This is an older building so it does show its age in some areas, i.e. bathroom. However, the hotel should do more to fix the broken and scratched decorative moldings in the rooms and hallways. It didn't stop me from enjoying my stay. Just a little picky on my part. Getting back to O'Hare is simple.

Because it is an older hotel, there are the occasional strange noises when the toilet flushes and when turning on the water in the shower (don't turn the hot water on too fast....the pipes make a loud noise!!), but, other than that, the retro-style of the room and the brightly painted walls made for a pleasant change of pace from standard hotel rooms. Our room was not as small as I thought they would be and had no problem with the smaller bathroom. The room was clean, bed comfortable and, because our room faced the street, no noises from the train. I did enjoy the \"world\" music that was played in the elevator and hallways. It was always invigorating!! The 5:00 wine/piano reception is a fun way to meet other guests and find out about other interesting things to do in Chicago. Although I am not a big fan of wine, the hotel does not break out their vintage wine for this reception. It tasted like it was lower end, but, the experience was still enjoyable. If you will be visiting Chicago for a few days and will be utilizing the train for transportation, I recommend buying the visitors pass for, I believe, $20 for 3 days. It saves the time and hassle of having to purchase a pass each time you use the train. Because the Allegro is in the theater and financial district, this may not be the place to stay if you want to go on a mad 3 day shopping spree as it is quite a distance from the good shopping unless you want to take the train. On a positive note, the Allegro is only about 1 block from the train, so, it has a very good location in that respect.

Great oversized velvet couches, a beautiful fireplace, even the elevator is nice with its hardwood floor and piped in smooth music. Our suites were incredible. Extremely spacious with a queen pull out bed and a king in the bedroom. The pull out wasn't the most comfortable bed in the world, but pull outs never are. We were in the middle of the theater district but you'd never know it at night, it was very quiet and dark in the rooms. Bathrooms were spotless and the Aveda amenities were fantastic. The walk to Millennium park was about 5 mintues. And it's a great park, not to be missed. The walk to Michigan Avenue was longer, but it's a nice walk. It probably took about 30 minutes and a taxi was about $6. The hotel is just down the street from a Corner Bakery, perfect for breakfast.

This was the worst experience we've ever had in a non-Communist-country hotel. We are very patient people, but after many experiences of a total lack of service, and staff's continual seeming lack of desire and ability to meet the needs of guests, we were extremely disappointed with our stay. Also--don't expect it to be a \"pet-friendly\" hotel, as they advertise: We were told, but not until AFTER we arrived (we'd asked ahead of time!), that there is actually nowhere for the pets to \"do their business\"---except for the concrete alley out back! Yuk! And that's also the cast and crew entrance for the Cadillac theatre! The very closest spot of grass--and it was as narrow as a sidewalk--is actually several blocks away in front of the Holiday Inn on the river. Don't believe the free Internet access that's alluded to in their literature, either--it's actually $24 an hour! And the rooms at the Allegro are so tiny that we could barely turn around....and the bathroom was no better. Very hard to get the door closed, while in the bathroom, without some contortionism. Much of the equipment in our room was malfunctioning, also, including the boom box, the TV, and the refrigerator (with all its mold). The staff also had not provided the promised dog bed, doggie gift pack, late check-out (due to my Husband's certification exam nearby), or emptying of the mini-bar. Had to ask for those again, and....you guessed it....was a long time before most of these things happened. Accessing a restaurant guide was a major hassle, as well....we'll spare you the frustrating details, including the anger on the part of Front Desk staff when we mentioned, in the middle of their temper tantrums, that this type of information actually is standard everywhere else we've stayed. This process alone took more than an hour. The concierge was almost never available, either, which was yet another frustration. A guest we met at the Holiday Inn's grassy strip with her dog said the rooms there are much bigger and nicer. We told the Manager on duty that we have NEVER had to work this hard to get our needs met....except in a hotel in rural China where we were the only English speakers.

We loved it! We arrived on Thursday, February 9th, and left on the 11th. To begin with, it was very convenient to get from O'Hare airport to the hotel. We got off the Blue Line at Clark/Lake and were just a little walk from the hotel. When we arrived at the front door, the doorman helped us with our bags and directed us to the lobby, which was really a sight to see. It was beautiful, and everything was so BIG! The windows, the sofas, the decor, everything was grand in scale. I loved all of the bright colors. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and polite, and we were in our room in no time. The walk from the lobby to the room was interesting because of the wallpaper in the hallways. It is a beautiful brown and cream vertical stripe, but if you're extremely sensitive to motion sickness bring your blinders! We got tickled because both of us were a little dizzy from walking past all those stripes... Our room (#1505) was pretty small, but since we didn't plan to spend a lot of time in the room, we didn't care. After quickly freshening up, we headed down to ask the concierge about making plans for the night. He was very helpful, and ended up pointing us to a deli for lunch, and where to get half price tickets to see 'Menopause: The Musical'(which was, by the way, a true side-splitter!). On our way to HotTix to buy the play tickets, we saw that we were actually very close to not only the blue line, but the red line, too, which was nice. After the play that night, we approached the front desk to ask about a good place to eat pizza at 10:00pm on a Thursday. The desk clerk pointed us, coupon in hand, to Giordano's in the Prudential Plaza and we walked in a snow storm to get there. Well worth the walk, though. Friday morning we headed down for our spa appointment at Spa Space. It was a very short walk from the hotel, and we were treated like queens for the (too) short time we were there. Shawn (at Spa Space) was great. We owe part of our fun there to him! He went out of his way to get us an appointment on short notice. We ate dinner on Friday night at 312 Chicago, right there in the hotel. The food was good, the service was OK. It was not the best we had in Chicago, but certainly not the worst. After dinner, it was just a short walk to the Ford/Oriental theater for 'Wicked', which was FABULOUS! Overall, we enjoyed the Allegro. The rooms were small, the pipes were a little loud, but the service and friendliness of the staff more than made up for those little quirks.

Although we had read the reviews here BEFORE we placed our bid, we took a shot that the Allegro would be OK. And it was. Sort of. We stayed for 4 nights in mid-August, it was a dead weekend in Chicago and we knew that we had our choice of available hotels in this price range (we use betterbidding to help us bid). Through this research we knew that we were winning the Allegro. Since we wanted a romantic getaway, we thought that the idea of a boutique hotel was appealing. Our first experience with the hotel was that as our taxi pulled up, the bellmen didn't help us out with our bags. They weren't especially busy, more like inattentive. Even after we hoisted our bags out the taxi's trunk, they didn't offer to help bring them inside. When we got to the desk, we had to wait about 15 minutes to be helped (even though we were 3rd in line and it was a Saturday). We agree that they're understaffed. 1-3 desk clerks for a 400 room hotel isn't enough. Before arriving I emailed requesting a quiet room, as my wife is pregnant and sleep is an issue. Upon checkin, I nicely mentioned this to the clerk and again requested a quiet room. He put us in a streetside room, on the 6th floor, directly above the theater where Lion King is showing AND the hotel's nightclub. Needless to say, crowds and traffic make noise. Additionally, the concerns others have mentioned about the noise INSIDE the hotel are DEFINITELY valid. Our neighbors on both sides of us were gettin' busy all night long and it felt and sounded like they were 2 feet away. When any toilet flushed it felt like we were IN the toilet and the refridgerater in our room hummed all night long. No sleep, whatsoever. This room was tiny, which we didn't mind, but the noise was unbearable (even for a heavy sleeper like me). The next day I went downstairs and they switched us to a great room on the 18th floor, away from the street. It was an upgraded, larger and newly remodeled room. Great room, great location. If we had been given this room to start with, it would've been a great stay. We don't think that using Hotwire meant we automatically got a bad room, we think that many of their rooms have these problems due to the design of the building. I think that we got our room switched because we asked on a Sunday, if it was busy, we get the impression that they might not be able to satisfy a request to do so. The location is really quite good. Lots of coffee shops and drug stores within a 10 minute walk. Marshall Fields is about a 6 block walk and the lakeshore area is about a 10 block walk. Lack of restaurants wasn't a big concern for us, as many are a $5 cab drive away. The wine reception was something we weren't interested in. The decor was nice. The business center charges a $3 activation fee and $1 per minute to use their computer to get on the internet, kinda steep. I think there's free Wi-Fi but didn't use it. The gym is pretty small, but equipped. Elevators can be very slow. Maid service was good. Beds and linens were very comfortable.

I never got the towels or coffee delivered, but had to beg a maid in the hallway to give me some. The front desk said they do not have those items there. Why not? Perhaps because it would look like service. Add to that, the cold cold room with temperature controls that did not work, a toilet that would not properly flush, one elevator down with the sound of drilling all day long (adding to the ambience); and booming construction all evening from the theatre next door that affected many floors and wings of the hotel. They said they would move me, but I wondered why they couldn't plan better and put me there to begin with. I would say there's an apparent lack of caring at this hotel.

Allegro is located in the theater area and near one of the El stations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was only a block and a half to traverse before making it to the property. Friendly bellmen escorted us in, and we ascended the staircase to the second level to check in (we discovered the nearby elevator later). The lobby reminded us of a contemporary mod 60s motif with red velvet couches, oversized midnight blue chairs and modern light fixtures. Dark wood covered the walls and was paired with a large, checkerboard carpet in brown and cream. The front desk staff was welcoming, explaining the business center, fitness area that I truly thought we would use and the surrounding areas. This lobby also serves as the locale where free unlimited wine flows during the wine hour, each evening from 5-6 p.m. The concierge is also located on this floor. Visiting Hotel Allegro marked one of the few times that I have used hotel hair products. All Aveda products were available and the small bathroom had a deep bathtub and marble countertops. The hotel itself is updated from an older building, so the rooms are not large according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards. We had enough space, and the rooms were carefully decorated in chocolate and salmon with accents of gold and light green. In an armoire, the expansive mini bar was stocked with a small refrigerator and dry goods area contained anything from Red Bull to snacks and even hangover remedies. A CD player was available as well. The closet housed an iron and ironing board, but by no means was this closet large, even to the smallest of munchkinlanders. The Encore Liquid Lounge had a groovy feel with upbeat tempos. We appreciated the Wicked-themed martinis such as the Lollypop Kid, making for an even better night of theater. People from all walks (literally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was a race that weekend) stopped in for drinks before or after the theater, on the way to dinner or as a nightcap. The bartenders were extremely attentive, even on the busiest nights. Food may also be purchased. 312 Chicago is the adjacent, on-site restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Allegro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amenities stretched from leopard print robes delivered on request to a complimentary yoga basket to use while watching the yoga station on television. We saw plenty of pets during our stay. Allegro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pet friendly policy is actually a good one - there is no weight limit and furry creatures can even book their own Happy Tails hotel package. Our only complaint was not even the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. A gaggle of teenagers stayed on our floor for a bat mitzvah and did not sleep much during the night, which meant that we had the privilege of enjoying their noise. The walls are definitely thin, although our room on the sixth floor overlooking the El did not have any street noise. The convenient location did prove to be in the middle of everything, even a parade. As we were in Chicago during Memorial Day weekend, the parade was gearing up just as we were leaving our hotel and we were able to enjoy it before moving on to nearby shopping on State Street and Michigan Avenue. We walked to both areas, but Michigan Avenue might merit a cab ride home, depending on the amount of shopping completed. Also nearby is the new Millennium Park, Grant Park, the Art Institute, tons of dining and more. We would definitely go back.

It is above a theatre and so this theatre \"feel\" prevailed throughout. There are plenty of floors and only 3 lifts so you have to wait a while sometimes, and ask for a room at the back to avoid the street noise. Our only problem in the room was that we couldn't switch the aircon off, and neither could the staff, so it was a bit noisy at night. The location is great, with the park and lakefront only a few minutes walk away. You can easily walk to the Magnificent Mile for all your shopping needs in 20 minutes. You can even walk to Navy Pier to get a boat or catch an IMAX film. I felt safe walking around there even at night but it is quiet as it is on the edge of the business area so keep your eyes open. If you want to save yourself some money getting to the airport the tube stop is only one block away and is only $1.75 - quicker than a van or taxi too. The bar at street level was always busy, and served great cocktails but the hotel lacked a good restaurant.

The girl at the front desk, Margo, was wonderful and was very helpful. We got to our room and both of us were shocked at how tiny the room was. We had booked a room with two double beds and the beds were literally butted up against the walls on either side with only enough space for a small table between them. There was a single luggage stand and we couldn't both fit our clothing in the miniscule closet (we packed 3 outfits each - no bulky coats). There was NO drawer space. The bathroom was even tinier. When you walked into the bathroom you literally had to stand to one side to shut the door. I've been in more spacious Motel 6's for a lot less money. The pillows and beds were absolutely wonderful but most everything else left a lot to be desired. We had problems with the thermostat in our room. It was quite warm and we were unable to locate directions on how to operate the electronic thermostat. I phoned down to the front desk and received some instruction but the thermostat never did work. After spending one night tossing and turning while dripping with sweat we contacted the front desk staff again the next morning. We received a promise that engineering would \"look into it\". We left for our conference and upon returning at 4:30 found the room still unbearably warm. We again contacted the front desk and again was promised that the engineer would check into it. After returning from an evening out at the theatre imagine our frustration and anger to discover it still wasn't fixed. We again called the front desk at which time we were told that engineering had checked into it and the room was 68 degrees which was cool enough. The thermostat on the wall read almost 74 and we were positive it was not even that cool. We were told that engineering would turn it down to 65 \"just for us\" but that still failed to cool the room. After a 4th and final call we were offered a noisy box fan which we gratefully accepted as there were numerous large conventions in town and there were no other rooms to be found (plus we weren't thrilled at the prospect of moving at midnight).

The decor is funky and fun and the bowls of tootsie rolls in the lobby was a hit with the kids. I found the staff to be very helpful (my sister left her contact solution in the car and he walked her up the wild valet garage to retreive it with little to no complaint). While the el was muffled, you could still hear approaching trains. We were on the corner overlooking the el and I have to say, it was a hit with the kids. While the adults vegged the kids sat in the window sill , fascinated by the trains. Who says that's a detraction? when we arrived, the air was not on and the room was hot. The system appeared to be on the fritz but a worker was called in immediately to fix it. While not crisp, the room was enough to satisfy my needs and that of my family. It's close enough to walk just about everywhere (the mag mile, the museums and shopping) with the el being very close for other trips. All in all, this was a nice experience. It was clean and comfy. And when my nephew threw up 5 minutes before check out time, the hotel told us to take our time and asked if we needed any help with the clean up.

The walls were not too thin, but if you have rude loud people next door (as we did one night), you may hear it. Otherwise, very quiet. The rooms were very comfortable, everyone was friendly and helpful and it was a fun hotel all in all. Way better than those boring old basic hotels like the Hilton and Hyatt!

From the concierge who promptly e-mailed me responses to my last minute pre-arrival questions to the doorman who gave us great ideas on where to take my children for breakfast, what great employees!

You can't beat the location, it is walkable to everything so you save $$ on cabs. The express check-out is great, just leave the keys in the room, wish more hotels had that service. I wouldn't recommend if you are staying more than a couple nights since you'd probably need a bigger room, but for a night or two it is perfect. You can't beat the price for being right in the Loop.

I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Two small negatives: I didn't care so much because I had early meetings, but the area around the hotel is rather dull at night; you'll have to cab it for any serious nightlife. (The hotel bar seems to be a popular spot though). Also, the elevators were a bit on the slow side...no big deal unless you are running late.

Great location to theater district, downtown shopping and restaurants, however several problems. First arrived only one elevator working which presents a problem as lobby/reception is on 2nd floor. Not properly staffed at check in and then over 45 mins to get elevator to 5th floor room. Room was small by any standards (I love older historic hotels and am used to small spaces but this is ridiculous). Hotel was sold out so even though I made reservation online and was promised room upgrade none were available and no apology or discussion at check in. Overall staff were distant and cold. 35 mins to retrieve car from valet at check out.

We booked into the Delux Suite which sleeps 4 people comfortably. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the hotel and it's facilities and found it to be very good value for money. The hotel was easy to find and the staff were extremely polite and efficient on arrival. We were taken straight to our room on the 3rd floor. The room / suite was extremely spacious, with a seperate lounge area with sofas, a sleeping area with 2 extremely comfortable double beds and built in wardrobe and a spacious bathroom. The room was extremely clean and tidy, with a large flat screen television. My only criticism would be that the fridge did not seem to work, so it wasn't possible to keep anything cold or make ice cubes. Also, there wasn't a great deal of storage space for clothes etc and only a few coat hangers in the wardrobe, but this wasn't the end of the world. The bathroom was also very clean, with a bath and shower (combined), towels and toiletteries changed on a daily basis. Although I did not see the maid, the maid service was very good and we left a generous tip. Being on the 3rd floor, meant that we did not have to use the lift, which was quite small but perfectly adequate. The reception area was pleasant and well maintained and door staff were very helpful. The bar on the second floor was also very nice and decorated to a modern standard. It would've been nice if hotel guests had been able to eat breakfast in the bar area, but this wasn't possible. It was a nice place to go and chill out, with free WiFi, and tea and coffee during the afternoon. I didn't have a drink there in the evening, but I believe the drinks were a little bit expensive. The breakfast area was a little on the small side, but we only had to queue on our first day and the wait wasn't too long. The breakfast is a bit limited, but it was included in the price and meant that we weren't having to look for somewhere to eat every morning and to be honest it was enough to keep us going until lunch time. They serve a selection of cakes, e.g. donuts and muffins, bagels and a limited selection of fruit (usually apples). Drinks included tea, coffee, fruit juice or ice water. It is all self service but you can help yourself to as much or as little as you like. You can't take food up to your rooms (there is an extra charge for this) so you have to sit at one of the tables to eat there. The location itself is excellent as it is pretty much central to all the main attractions, with the Empire State Building literally a 2 minute walk around the corner. It's also very near to some of the main shops including Macy's 34th Street store and many of the main high street stores. There is a subway station on the corner which takes you pretty much anywhere you need to go, uptown or downtown and the 7 day subway passes are extremely reasonsable if you plan to use the subway a lot. As for places to eat, there are plenty of places near by. I would definitely recommend Hartlands Brewery underneath the Empire State Building for a traditional American Grill experience. And if you're on a real tight budget, there are a lot of places where you can buy a slice of pizza on the go, or McDonalds, KFC and Subway all within walking distance. Being in the Koreon District there are also a number of Eastern European restaurants nearby. Dwayne Read (Convenience Store) is just a round the corner and is extremely useful for any bits you might need on your stay, from cosmetics to nibbles! All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel and New York in general. Staying in a suite was probably better than staying in a standard room, which might be on the small side, but you should definitely give this hotel a go if you're looking for somewhere in a central location, reasonably priced and well maintained! It's not the Plaza, but I would certainly recommend it and would definitely go there again if I revisit New York!", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cSurprise!

Our first experience walking into the hotel, the doorman doesn't open the door or offer to help with the bags. After 45 minutes of standing at the counter (without a single person in cue to check in) we finally check in and are told by the man at the counter to go relax and enjoy a COMPLIMENTARY breakfast. We walk into the little cafe and fix our plates and sit down and within seconds we get kicked out of the little \"restaurant\" after being told that we aren't eligible for the free meal until the next morning (we were given the option to pay $10 per person). Okay, lets break down and summarize the entire stay and why you should stay here... The front desk service is substandard. The hotel staff are rude. The room smells. The bathroom smells like mold. The shower was dirty and water flow was terrible. The temperature was too warm in the room even after asking to lower it. Woken up by house keeping (with a do not disturb sign on the door). The \"breakfast\" was stale donuts and bagels. the lounge on the second floor...the coffee was nasty and Oreo cookies out were probably several days old. Needless to say... terrible experience. Do yourself a favor... pay a few more dollars and Enjoy yourselves elsewhere. Do not stay in this hotel. Okay, one positive thing to say.. the location was great.

Located in Korea Town, right between Macy's and Empire State Building, this is a good base for Manhattan exploration. Plenty of Asian restaurants and eateries around. Combine \"cheap\" hotel in good location and it is obvious this is a very busy place, and the two receptionists struggle a bit to handle the \"traffic\". The rooms are clean, but the furnishing is dated and has seen better days. The frequent use shows everywhere - from squeaky bed to door leaving a gap above the carpet, transferring any sound from the corridor directly to the room. The breakfast (\"breakfast included\" was advertised when I made the booking on the internet) was a joke - coffee in a plastic mug with plastic spoon, muffin on a plastic plate and a fruit. All in all some 5 dollars value. If they did not advertise breakfast and did not offer anything, I would actually give the hotel one more point in this review. But this way, certain expectations were simply not fulfilled.

The hotel was located near the subway entrance and we were able to easily navigate the city from it. Breakfast was included each morning downstairs and was really good.

The only negative with the breakfast was that we couldn't take anything from the dining area and one morning one of the girls wasn't able to go down with the rest of us and we wanted to take something up to her and couldn't. The only real drawback of this hotel was the elevator. There was only one and it was small and always in use.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC for comfort, location and price. It is rather old but has been remodeled recently and they have done a good job with it.

It is in the middle of Korean quarter filled with multiple Korean restaurants and stores. The hotel itself is not that great but it's good for its price. I spent most of the time outside of hotel enjoying New York City. Bed and bathroom were the only things I concerned about. Bathroom was clean. All appliances were working fine. Air conditioner was quite and cold enough to set a pleasant temperature in the room. The room itself (the queen size one) was dark and small, the TV model was old CRT but it worked fine. The very first night I arrived to the hotel my room was not available and they placed me in the King Size room instead, which was much bigger, newer and brighter. They called it \"complimentary\" thing. I thought that I will stay in that room but, unfortunately, the next morning they relocated me to my dark queen size room while I was on my business meeting. No complaints, anyway. The elevator in the building is old, small and slow. For those, who get breakfast - you will receive orange juice, hot water with some selection of teas and coffee, croissants, danishes, cookies. Not really a wide variety. The place is crowded in the morning. Final words - I will stay in this hotel again if my funds are limited. Bed and pillows were not comfortable :) Oh, there is no iron in the queen size room but there is one in the king size one.

Before leaving I read a couple of terrible reviews for this hotel and I was a little concerned. However I experienced none of the criticisms levelled by these reviewers. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room, a twin, was newly decorated and refurbished and was very clean. Towels and sheets were changed daily without problem. The rooms were well equipped with a fridge, a safe and there was plenty of storage space. It also had flat screen tv. The air conditioning was very effective and could be adjusted manually in the room. My only criticism was the room was a little dark with a view of a brick wall. However ,the room more than served its purpose. Breakfast was a little repetitive but tasty and filling. The food was never stale during our seven night stay. We did have to wait a few minutes on some days for a table but not for long. Complimentary coffee and biscuits were served in the bar until 3pm which was also helpful as the location made it possible to pop back with shopping or a break during the day. Free internet access on the 2nd floor was also great. We only occasionally had to wait for the lift but again only for a few minutes. The location was fantastic with easy access to the main sights . Overall this is an excellent 3 star hotel that is extremely good value. There are many hotels in the area but many cost significantly more than the hotel Stanford. True it is not the standard of a Marriot as one reviewer unfairly compared it with, but it doesn't pretend to be.It charges a lot less.i did consider staying at the Marriot with points I have but it still worked out about 60% more expensive.

I chose this hotel because the reviews weren't GREAT, but they weren't bad either. For the cheap price and the location we decided to go for it. We booked a suite which had 2 queen beds and a sofa. I got charged extra tax because there was a \"second\" room and its considered a living room, but it really isn't. I just think they said there was tax and were really just taking our money. First off, when you go there the check in process is ridiculously slow. I got there around 1pm and they told me GUARANTEED check in time was 3pm and they were not done cleaning all the rooms so we understood and went out to grab lunch. We got back after eating and a brisk walk around 330pm and found that the room was still not ready. They told us it would be ready in 10 minutes so we went to the bakery next door for some coffee and snacks. We came back and sat in their \"lobby\" which is tiny until about 4pm. My wife was already annoyed that the GUARENTEED check in time was 3pm and we werent even in the room at 4pm. ONE HOUR LATER! We were frustrated and then had to wait another 15 minutes for ONE ELEVATOR to get taken to the 9th floor. Terrible choice of 1 elevator. (This posed a problem for us everyday waiting about 15 minutes and stopping at every floor going up and down). When you walk into the room, the room had a rustic old smell. It had a nice flat screen tv, but the covers were old and the carpet looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned for months which seems quite disgusting. The room temperature is a problem since they have \"central air conditioning system\"?! Whenever we asked the front desk to lower the temperature.... nothing happened. After awhile we just gave up and bought a fan for the room on the 2nd night. I also asked for water and it was delivered 1 hour later after which I had already gone out and bought it from a small convenient store next door. We encountered bed bugs on the 3rd night after one of my children had bites up her leg. After mentioning this to the front desk, they told us everything is alright because they do weekly bed bug sprays by a professional. We politely asked for new sheets or a room change and they forgot. After asking a few more times around 11pm they finally brought it up, meanwhile WAKING us up. It felt like they forgot and remembered later on in the night which was really rude. The front desk staff is nice and friendly, but their service is slow. A couple days the housekeeping didn't clean our rooms and they claimed we had \"Do Not Disturb\" signs on our doors. In reality we lost that sign on the 1st night and we desired room service each day we were out, so that was strange. The bellman on the otherhand are rude men asking for tips when they bring new towels and sheets to us. The bellman named Miguel just snatched our bags when we were trying to leave and directing us to a cab when we didn't need one. He insisted and argued with me briefly while leaving my bag on the steps and storming back inside. However, there is one bellman named Edward and he was a fine gentleman. Outside the hotel he helped direct us to a nice restaurant he liked nearby. Also he helped bring up some amenities on Saturday night and asked us politely if we needed anything else or if anything was needed to be adjusted. Very polite and gentlemanlike. OVERALL, my stay was not pleasant at all. The location is perfect, but the hotel is anything from perfect. Like the title says, TERRIBLE hotel wasted on a great location. If you have no other location to go to, then go here. Other than that I would choose another hotel.

Looked at the carpet and felt dirty where i did not want to walk bear foot. I at least had my socks on the whole time. Since the room was worm i put the thermostat at 65 degrees and the temp in the room never went below 70 degrees. When i looked at the base boards they looked like something was splashed all over. As I try to settle down in the room i went to the bathroom and lets say it was not at par at all. Toilet shook as you sat on it. There was no place to put toiletry, I had to put it on the dresser in the bedroom. Looked in the tiny closet that had 4 hangers there was no Iron. So when i asked for an Iron they brought one with an ironing board. When i tried to open the ironing board it was rusted and it opened about two feet of the ground. I was better off ironing on the bed. Oh by the way in the whole room there was one plug accessible under the desk. No other plugs in the room at all. So then when i returned in the evening there i pulled the sheets back and there was long hair in the bed. Asked them to bring new sheets and it never showed up. i basically slept on top of the bed and also removed two pillows of the bed because 1 had blood stain and 1 had some kind of stain. I did not put my head on the other two pillows. I made sure the pillows were covered with the sheets and slept that way. Next morning Continental breakfast was covered so went to the little restaurant in the lobby and was greeted with an attitude. i had to wait in line to get really crappy coffee, hard donuts, and dry as heck muffins on a paper plate and plastic utensils. Lets say i did not eat the continental breakfast there again. I got way better food from the street vendor. Lucky for me i was not in the room for the whole day the next day and spent just one another night and even though i had told two house maids about the sheets and pillows they still were not changed for the second night. Third day i had a life saver friend who said I was checking out and she put me in the Midtown Marriott with her Marriott Rewards point. I checked out of this pace a day early and the front desk had nothing to say but sorry you are leaving us. I even gave them the survey left in the room. Front desk had a young kid so he did not give a rats behind. I basically paid for a day/night i did not use.

There were four of us in total, in two twin rooms. Price: Firstly as regards price, it was the best I could find for that time of the year in a central location and which met our needs. We all know how expensive hotels are in the general Manhattan area and on location alone for five nights, we got quite a good deal. Rooms: We booked two twin rooms. We got rooms on the 3rd & 8th floors. Both rooms were identical. Each room had two single beds, desk, walk in wardrobe with safe and bathroom. The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t massive, but was quite spacious for our needs and a lot bigger than I had anticipated from reading previous stories of NY hotel rooms. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom was moderate size and had a bath with shower attached. Bathroom could do with a bit of cleaning around tiles, etc, but wasnt bad. Room had a nice flat screen TV on the wall, radio alarm clock, fridge. There was no view from the room, just of an adjoining building next door, but a view is not something I had anticipated in central Manhattan. My biggest flaw with the room was the air conditioning. There was a temperature control switch on the wall, but the actual air vent seemed to not work. There was no air coming from it at all. Then on our 3rd day there, it suddenly seemed to start working fine, but only for that day, as it then ceased blowing air again! The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly warm or cold, but I would have liked the A/C to be working as meant too. Staff: Staff seemed friendly and helpful when needed. The door staff were helpful in organising taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 staff, room cleaners, all friendly. Overall no problems here. Breakfast: There is complementary breakfast from 7am-10am in the Ele cafe which is situated just off the hotel lobby. The breakfast consists of Coffee, juice, bagels, muffins, doughnuts, pastries of all sort really. It certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your conventional type breakfast, but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad to get the day started with before finding something more substantial out on the street. One thing I found most mornings was a queue. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge amount of seating in the cafe and guest have to queue up until a table comes free, so one can be waiting on average 5 - 10mins. Staff in the cafe were very friendly and we got to know the man handing out the trays each morning well during our stay. General: The hotel has a \"business centre\" on the second floor, which consists of two computers and the internet. Its free to use and is handy for checking mails, etc. There is also free WI-FI in this area, but only until 3pm, then there is a charge. Beside the business centre, there is a wine bar. It serves coffee during the day I think and wine/drink until 1 or 2am I believe. Check out time from the hotel is 12pm, but there is a baggage store in the main lobby where the door man will lock away bags for later collection, which is handy when catching a late flight. To sum up, the hotel is in a great location. It certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything fancy, but does the job well and has everything one should need. For someone who just wants a room for the night and is going to be out and about all day, then the Stanford fits the bill 100%.

After the first time we simply asked for a fan to circulate some air. Each time, instead of a fan, we had someone else knock on the door advising they would fix the AC, at which point, I felt compelled to tip them.

The desk staff did not really look up to recognise people as they came in and out but were fine if directly spoken to. The doorman was helpful and waited with us outside when waiting for a early shuttle in the dark upon our departure. As others have said, the area feels very safe and is in close proximity to a lot of shopping and the subway, and of course the magnificent Empire State Building.

We may very well be in for a rude shock when we try other places when we return to New York, but we were dissatisfied enough to take the chance and try somewhere else next time.

Nice dark decor and very friendly staff. Not a lot of people though, just a few other customers. The hotel also offers a business center, where you can use the internet. Overall we were pretty happy with it, though it was on the high end of our budget: we paid almost $1400 for 5 nights. Oh and the one thing I would offer is free wireless internet. It was $10 per day or $35 for 5 days.

I chose the Stanford because of location and because it was the only hotel I could find that offered a two room suite with two queens (to accommodate the three girls) for a price I could afford. I also reserved a king deluxe for myself. Both rooms were spacious by NY standards - furniture was a bit worn, but the linens were fresh, white and clean - the bathrooms were fine in both rooms, but the girls' bathroom was nicer than mine (black countertops and nicer fixtures - mine was more basic, but ok). When we arrived our rooms were not ready until almost 4:00PM, so were offered a 1:00 PM checkout to compensate. The front desk clerks were very nice and helpful throughout our stay. I liked the small coffee/pastry shop adjacent to the lobby, and it was open very late, even after the theater - this is the same location they used for the complimentary breakfast. A previous review was correct - the complimentary breakfast could have been better. The offerings (coffee, juice, bagels, cereal) were ok, but the problem was space. When I went down at about 9:00, every table was full and a long line at the service area - so I just purchased coffee and didn't try to wedge in. This needs improvement - but it's the only real complaint I had. Another previous review mentioned faulty air conditioning and experiencing a warm room - we had the opposite problem (but it wasn't really a problem) because both or our rooms (one on 3rd floor and one on 9th) were quite cool - even chilly - and changing the thermostat didn't seem to affect it. However I prefer a cool room, can't sleep in a warm one, so I was fine with that. The block the hotel is on is in a super-convenient location. 32nd st is called \"Korea town\" and is lined with Korean shops and restaurants - a little congested and not the most beautiful block in NYC, but again, was fine. We felt safe walking at night. I used to work in NY and have stayed in many midtown hotels over the years, and know the city well. This is not an elegant hotel, but nice enough, secure, and clean - I would not hesitate to stay again if I needed the extra space at a good price (hard to find suites with two queens and a sofa bed in NY for less than $350).

My room was $189/night and I got so much more than what I paid for. *Side note. This was my third trip to New York and the fifth hotel I've stayed in in the city. For those who have not traveled to NYC before, expectations for New York hotels should be vastly different than most other cities. What would buy you a suite in some markets will get you a dingy, cramped room in New York. I see a lot of overly critical reviews of NY hotels on TripAdvisor. I'm sorry, but unless you are spending $450-$500 a night you should not expect a spacious room with a view. That is unrealistic and in many cases a testament to the level of ignorance of the traveler's part. If you properly set your expectations before traveling, you'll be much more pleased with your stay.* Moving on :) This hotel is a GREAT deal. The location is incredible! We were there 4 days and only had to take the subway once-to get to the financial district. Times Sq and Central Park were both within walking distance. We were less than two blocks from Penn Station and the Empire State Building. The hotel lobby was cute and clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. We arrived 3 hrs before check-in and our room was ready so they let us in early which was great. We had a room with two single beds, which looked to have been recently renovated. It was clean and actually more spacious than I was expecting. The bed linens were clean and comfortable, there was a minifridge, the bathroom was clean and toiletries (Bath and Body Works) were included. The room was a perfect mix of older touches (crown moulding, tile work in the bathroom, pedestal sink, very large deep tub) and renovated design touches (tufted headboard, fluffy white linens). There was absolutely no street noise whatsoever. One big perk was complimentary breakfast in the morning (coffee, OJ, bagels, donuts) and they served it until 10 which is helpful for us west-coasters adjusting to the time change.

NEGATIVES - Bed (it may have been only our room - or perhaps our taste, but the bed was overly soft, and not put together well. Everytime you turned over the whole bed was like a ship on water!) - Radiator Noise (the loudest pipework & radiator I think I've heard in a room!

The service was ordinary, the staff helped us when we asked for booking shuttelservice to the airport etc. The only thing that not was so good was teh breakfast. Donuts, bagels and coffee/tea. Nothing more. But that was not a big thing. There was a lot of delis and coffeshops etc round the corner. And expecting most of NY-hotels don\u00c2\u00b4t have breakfast at all, we didn\u00c2\u00b4t care at all.

At roughly $331 a night US - which equates to $500 AUD a night this was NOT a cheap option in relation to what I would normally pay. You could get a 5 star in Australia for less than this - but I am told this is nowhere near expensive for this town and beggars cant be choosers. We had to wait whilst US customers checked in and in each case they were paying much lower rates than us and I suspect this hotel was slugging the foreigners much more in some cases. They also upgraded the couple checking in prior to us who were only staying for a few days. I may be making assumptions but it did stick in my mind. The location is excellent. Right in Midtown, next to a subway stop, near Macy's (though I wouldnt bother Macy's aint what it used to be and Saks is MUCH better) and within walking distance of everything. Try Speedys on the corner for excellent and more healthy takeaway options if you cant face another night out. I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful but the foyer space and the street frontage small and in need of a bit of a spruce up. There is one lift and yes it is slow but adequate. Our room had just been painted - and though I think was done with the best intentions it smelt horrible. We stayed for 9 nights and under the circumstances would have hoped for a better room - but as the hotel was literally at full occupancy there was no point complaining. It was small - and I mean small - not suck it up NYC hotel rooms are small, I mean I think I just got shut in the broom closet small - just enough for the supposed Queen bed (which was only a double) and table and chair and the tv. No amount of mirroring the wall was going to make it seem larger. My husband literally could not get out of his side of the bed as he hit the \"mirrored\" wall. The bathroom was ok not grotty or scummy but again not the greatest. No rats no bugs all ok in that area. Lumpy floor and dodgy electrical sockets - my father the electrician would have had a total OH&S fit if he had seen the state of the power points. But the door locked properly, it didnt smell after the paint subsided and we felt safe - and TV in the US always blows us away - you must watch \"Extreme Loggers\" that is just one tiny step away from reality tv insanity. I have to say though I really did love the Backstage Dressing room lights around the bathroom mirror - very glamorous. We had no control over our room temperature and as NY has been humid of late we had to keep opening the window which introduced my main gripe. Noise and Light. We faced Korea Way which means we had flashing neons and yelling, honking and screaming 24/7 - and I mean 24/7 - who the hell eats Korean BBQ at 4am I do not know but hey its NYC! For those not familiar with such things this entire strip is full of great restaurants the deal however is they literally are open 24 hours and all sorts of exuberant people frequent them at all sorts of hours. After 44 hours of flying from the other side of the world this was just too much for my senses and I spent the next 24 hours with a serious migraine. Interesting sidebar here - you cannot buy codeine over the counter in the US - I discovered this the hard way - so bring your own from home if you are a headache/migraine sufferer like me. Another interesting sidebar - if you get really sick and need help there are walkup physicians available in some of the Duane Reades the closest to Stanford is 7th and 50th. So not that close if you are sick but worth knowing as a foreigner. House Keeping went through every day - BUT - they did not actually change the bed sheets everyday - I happened to notice a mark I made was still there 2 days later. I rationalised this in my mind by reminding myself I dont change the sheets at home every day either. The breakfast is bagels, donuts, coffee and juice. My husband was in Homer heaven - but an egg was sounding really good half way into our stay. But as many people say you are not in NYC to sit in your room and if a safe, adequate hotel room is all you are looking for then this is fine but haggle on the price if you can. I do have one gripe - the day of check out our flight was not until 9pm that night. I had yet another migraine and was facing another 36 hours on a plane. My husband went down to explain our situation and ask if we could have a later checkout. Now normally most hotels are totally ok with this and under the circumstances do not charge you - well in other countries anyway...but they wanted another $150US and would only let us stay until 3pm. I was so ill we had no choice but to cough up but the lack of understanding was genuinely disappointing. I can only hope - though this may sound mean spirited - that the economic downturn in the US forces some of these hotels to pull there heads in and charge more reasonable rates to match the level of their accommodation. I sincerely believe this is sheer opportunism gone mad in a city that needs to get stuck in and regulate its hospitality industry a bit more and enforce price structures and star ratings with a bit more zeal. If this hotel were in the UK it would be a 2 star at best and I doubt it would even get a rating in Australia or New Zealand. I can only say if you can shop around on rates do so - it will be worth it in the long run. Some hotels a bit further down - three to four blocks east on 31st were much cleaner and in much quieter areas but still totally accessible to everything - remember everywhere in NYC is just a subway stop away so dont be too taken in by the \"Midtown\" location unless you are seeing broadway shows every night.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Feltham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJust what we asked for\u201d", "Author": "Nicola W", "ReviewID": "UR21841868", "Content": "I will only be reiterating the other reviews on here, but like to get my review on here to help the hotel rating.

A few doors down the hotel, there was a grocery store so you could buy water to keep in the fridge that the hotel provided you. it was 2 blocks from Macy, close to all the shops and restaurants, about 10 blocks to Theater area ( it was not as far as it sound and it was a great walk with shops and lots of things to watch) and the subway was a few steps away. I bought a $25 subway ticket for 7 days for both subways and bus so I walked and used the subway, bus to everywhere. My daughter loved the Broadway shows so we stood in line to get the discount tickets everyday. The Wicked show did not have discount tickets but it was worth the full price. We saw Phantom of the Opera, Grease and Wicked and Wicked was our favorite show. The only thing that the hotel was not very helpful was on what to see and what was the best way to see it. But they had a lot of weekly free magazines with activities so you can plan for your time.

It's a narrow building, but you enter into a very nice lobby with a lovely crystal lighting arrangement in the ceiling that sets the tone for a high-class hotel. There's just one small elevator, but there is also a narrow staircase if you don't want to wait. The staff were extremely friendly and willing to help, and the room was surprisingly large for a New York hotel. One wall was mirrored which may have made it seem larger, but we also had a dresser, a table and chairs, a small refrigerator, and a fair-sized closet with its own safe, which you program with your own code. The bathroom was larger than most of the others we had during our trip, which was unexpected and appreciated. The TV didn't get a lot of channels, but it was enough considering we spent most of our time out anyway. We were lucky to have a street view room with two windows, but many rooms appeared to be right against other buildings. The breakfast selection was limited, but nice if you just want to grab something quick before getting out to enjoy the city. The staff there were friendly and helpful as well. There's a subway station on the corner and the Empire State Building is just a block away. There are convenience stores and restaurants nearby, and a parking garage right across the street which offers preferred rates to guests of the hotel - which was the real selling point for us. (I do NOT recommend driving in Manhattan unless you really know what you're doing - it was definitely an adventure! - lol) Just make sure to get your parking validated when you check out. We walked back to the hotel from Times Square (via the Empire State Building) and it didn't take long. We did the hop-on, hop-off bus tour, which I highly recommend as well. (Note: our tour guide told us you can take the Staten Island ferry and see the Statue of Liberty closer for free - wish we'd known that before we bought advanced tickets!) The price was great for New York options, although expensive compared to other cities. We paid $189 per night plus $36 per night at the garage for our truck (it's $26 for a car).

We stayed for four nights in mid Sept 2007. It was good value for money as the room was clean and large, the bed was comfortable and the location was excellent (very near Macy's, and a 15 minute walk to Times Square). The detractions were noise (got ear plugs) and possibly some exposure to cigarette smoke (but I am very sensitive). For more info on these see below. Overall though we were happy with what we got and would stay there again or recommend it to friends who do not want to pay top dollar. Noise: I would suggest trying to get as high a floor as possible and/or a room not facing the street due to noise. We were on the third floor facing the street and after the first night we bought ear plugs as this is definitely the city that never sleeps! We were fine in terms of noise after that, and the curtains were heavy so we could sleep in if we wanted. The only other issue was that although we were told it was a non-smoking room, I am very sensitive and woke up the first couple of mornings with my sinuses bothering me and slightly puffy eyes. There was a cigaratte burn in the comforter and I detected a slight musty smell I associate with cigarettes in the corridor and possibly also in the room, so I think there may have been some residual cigarette smoke. However, I could also have been reacting to other things such as cleaning products or pollution - this has happened (and been worse) in hotels in other major cities. Check in and out was very friendly and efficient. Room was very good, everything extremely clean, good daily cleaning; furniture in pretty good condition; suprisingly good room size (king size deluxe), much bigger than we are used to for the money; very comfortable bed and pillows; excellent bathroom, lots of towels and good toiletries, although the fan was incredibly noisy. We took our laptop and paid to have broadband access in our room, very convenient. My husband tried the breakfast one day - it was in the bar area and there was not enough seating for everyone who wanted to eat. I think the food was your basic pastries, cereal and fruit, not a 'cooked' breakfast. The cafe on the ground floor was closed for renovation. We did not try the Korean food but our friends told us the hotel's restaurant is one of the best. We tried a Vietnamese place down the street that was very good.

I think the people before were just too stupid to know how to use the shower. It has three handles--very strange--but if you figure out how each one works it's not a problem. The issue is that the shower head and the spout can be on at the same time. Because of this it may seem like there is no watter pressure--however, if you just turn off the spout the shower head is fine. Perhaps the hotel was bad in the past, but I found that the people were friendly, the accomodations were clean and acceptable, and was close to everything--incluiding several subways... Final note--would I stay here by choice? Probably not--I'd probably shell out a little more and stay somewhere a little nicer, but that's just the elitist talking . . .

A double bed non-smoking room that came to about a little over $310.00 for a couple nights. The front desk agents and the doormen were very nice and friendly. They always smiled at you. Unfortunately, as soon as I entered the hotel, there was this strange and unpleasant smell in the lobby, which I later found out it was also in the elevator and the hallways. In fact, the whole building reeked of it! The odor was similar to a mixture of gas and cigarette smoke. By the way, they gave you a breakfast coupon upon check-in. I did not have breakfast at this hotel, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what kind of breakfast food they provided. The elevator was very slow. If your room is only on the fourth floor or lower, just take the stairs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faster that way. The hallways were small and narrow. There was not enough room to stretch your arms. My room was up on the 8th floor and just might be the smallest one in the hotel. Or maybe all double bed rooms were that small. The bed was OK, a little bit too firm for me. There was a small TV with basic cable and a VCR in the room. A decent size of desk and a refrigerator in the closet. If you need to use iron and ironing board, you will have to request housekeeping to provide them. There was also a small safe in the closet, which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. Window was small and the view outside was nothing spectacular and I could see a parking lot in the next building. I actually like the bathroom. It was small but very neat. Your basic toiletries were there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soap, shampoo, shower cap, and there was this small toothbrush and toothpaste sealed in plastic wrap, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend using. Now major complaints with my stay in this hotel: 1. There was this LOUD clanking noise coming from the heater. It sounded like there was actually a construction in my room! The noise was sporadic. You could hear it a few minutes in the mornings, afternoons, and evenings. 2. The room was actually too warm for me. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winter you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be needing A/C. I had to open the window because it got too hot in the room and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn off the heater. I think the control was actually broken. 3. There was not enough light in the bathroom and the bedroom. Ladies, if you need to put your make-up on in this kind of light, forget about it. 4. Did I mention about the smell in the elevator and the hallways? Plus, it was a non smoking room, but somehow I still could smell it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a budget like me, then by all means, stay at this place. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hard to please, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be fine at this hotel. Besides, the location can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in midtown, 3-4 minutes walking distance to Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Manhattan Mall, Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secret, etc. Less than 10 minutes away (walking) from Madison Square Garden. And the subway stop (N/R/W/Q) was literally a few steps away from the hotel. But if you have some extra money to spend, please find another hotel. By the way, the Lincoln \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taxi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cabs out front charged less than others. Most drivers I saw were Korean (makes sense since the hotel was in Korea town). The trip to JFK only cost $45.00 plus toll fee (about $4.00) and tip. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken these Lincoln cabs where they charged $60.00 to $80.00.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGREAT VALUE HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "tuggey", "ReviewID": "UR6551178", "Content": "Stayed at the Stanford from Dec 28th - Jan 2nd.

All handled well. But this is New York! I expect loudness, arrogance and a bit of attitude. When we arrived and walked in, I was instantly disappointed. No bustling atmosphere and the staff had VERY thick accents, sometimes hard to understand. (This hotel is in the middle of Korea town). The hotel was also heavy with international tourists and this is not a problem of itself, but I wish I'd known before. I was expecting to be in a hotel full of loud Americans. For New York atmosphere, the hotel we stayed in later compares ten times more favourably than this.

The price was also right, but those benefits weren't enough to offset the negatives. Hotel Stanford is located in Little Korea adjacent to Herald Square. It is conveniently close to stores, a subway station, and many Midtown sights. Unfortunately, you will feel like you are staying in a Third World country, not just a foreign hotel. The neighborhood is seedy, smelly, and jammed with people....most of whom are NOT middle class American tourists! The hotel staff struggled with English and there was not the even the minimum amount of customer service that one would expect from a Motel 6. Next time we will know enough to stay in an American hotel with the level of service to which we are accustomed. The hotel is not handicapped accessible and doesn't try to be and there are no handicapped rooms. We had to routinely ask for the basic amenities such as soap and towels, and felt that the staff was looking at us like we were there to steal the linens. Our suite was shabby and not very clean with mold in the shower, that sort of thing. Some lights and things did not work. There was a nice tile seat in the shower though. The room had no coffeemaker, and the continental breakfast was a joke. In a week there we couldn't even get a hot cup of coffee, and there was no cream. We also found a cockroach in our room. I never saw an ice machine, but at least we were able to keep a pitcher of cold water in the little refrigerator. The worst problem, however, was the ventilation system. The weather was hot and humid the week we were there, and the air conditioning only worked in some of the rooms.....when they bothered to turn it on. When our first room had no a/c at all, they moved us to a different one, but every day they would randomly turn it off. The thermostats in each room didn't work, and the air seemed to be controlled somewhere on each floor. When the a/c was on, we got quite a bit of cigarette smoke from somewhere seeping in our room through the vents, but when it was OFF the smoke was even worse. It poured in through the vents so heavily that we could barely see across the room. All our clothes and luggage were smoke-damaged by the time we returned home. (We were supposed to be on a non-smoking floor, but their a/c didn't work on that floor.) Two of us ended up sick before we left, and I'm sure the poor air quality didn't help.

Our check-in was smooth, however, the person at the front desk neglected to inform us that the following morning there was a Korean Festival taking place and if you parked on 32nd Street (which we did directly across the street from the hotel), that you would have to have your car out before 8:00am or you would be stuck there until 6:00pm when the festival ended and 32nd Street reopened. It wasn't until 12:30am after the concert, when we headed up to our room did we notice the plain white flyer posted on the wall stating that the street would be closed off. Not being early morning people, and had not yet unwound from the concert, we had no desire to be leaving prior to 8:00am so we ended up driving home at 1:00am that night . So we weren't real happy with the lack of information. We understand the hotel does not control street closures, however, the staff could have been more informative so we could have parked elsewhere and saved us alot of hassle. Needless to say, we paid $200 for a hotel room we basically only used to change clothes. As for the room itself, it is very small and not kept very clean. The bed was uncomfortable, the tv old and the fridge kept things luke warm at best. The towels in the bathroom were clean, however, the bathroom itsself was not and the tub was disgusting. The pictures of the room and bathroom are greatly enhanced on their website. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel with a great location and are only staying 1 night this hotel will do.

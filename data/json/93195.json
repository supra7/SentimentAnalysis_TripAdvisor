{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Park Plaza New Orleans ex Radisson: AWFUL! DON'T GO!! I stayed at this hotel as there were no rooms available at other hotels in town. It was a real nightmare!When I entered my room, I felt a bad smell: there was urine in the bathroom, both on the basin ( full of yellow stains) and on the floor. I ran to the telephone, by the bed, to complain, and opened the linens, just to check... What a surprise when I found a huge blood stain on the linens!! Would you believe me if I tell you that NOBODY at Reception apologized for this? THey just told me: would you like us to clean it? Or do you prefer a new room?. Of course, I asked for another room... WHich was not better at all... NO blood, but also urine and pubic hairs and so on... I asked for a new change and they gave me what they called the suite. Apparently, the best room at the hotel... It turned out that the suite was not clean either. Tired, I called Housekeeping and gave them some money to clean the bathroom... They intended to clean it just with water!!!!! Even when it had clear marks of urine and other staff!! I asked them to use some bleach!Having a bath was another nightmare... Towels were FULL of PUBIC HAIRS! I asked for a change... And new towels were just the same. It seems that towels come with hairs at that hotel!No room service was available except from a pizza store nearby. Smell at the corridors was terrible! COuld you believe that rest of pizzas and dirty staff would remain at the corridors for more than 24 hours? Nobody picked them up!Elevators were old, worn out and always busy. Too many people going up and down all the time. The hotel was crowded, so you could hear screams and loud voices all the time.Because all of this, I complained to the General Manager of the hotel. He did not even seem surprised. It seemed that he was used to all this. There were signs all over stating that if any part of your stay was not pleasant, you won\u9e93t pay for it. Of course, this is not true!! They even charge you extra money if you intend to shorten your stay at the hotel!I tried to write RADISSON to complain about this. It is a shame that a company like this offer this kind of service and hotel. But it seems that RADISSON IS NOT INTERESTED IN CUSTOMER\u9e93S VOICE: at their web, they ask you to fill in lots of data and information about yourself and your complain. And finally, when you try to submit your complain, the system does not work and just inform you that it could not be sent. I tried to do this at least three times, on different days. Always the same!I know Radisson has sold this hotel, as they had too much headache with it. HOwever, I find them the only responsible for what I had to go through, as they were the owners at that moment. This is why I WILL NEVER RETURN TO A RADISSON HOTEL AGAIN IN MY LIFE!", "Date": "Apr 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR718405079", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Sil2006"}, {"Content": "Hopefully something's changed in 3 years Probably the worst hotel I've ever encountered in my life.

Little did we know that we'd have more satisfaction staying home and going to work. Don't get me wrong, we had a great time together when we were NOT in the hotel. New Orleans is a great city.Please take a moment to read the below bullet points:- The Park Plaza is located on a strip that resembles 125th street in Harlem  during the 80's.- We had to check in to 3 different rooms - the first one was unmade and dirty; the second stunk of cigarette smoke and the third one, although called a suite was a dump. Paper thin walls allowing all kinds of entertainment (vomitting, coughing, drunks banter) to enter our room at high decibles. - 2 out of 5 elevators were out of service, so you had to wait 20 minutes to get downstairs.- We found pubic hairs on our clean towels, as well as a turkey sandwich ordered from the nasty bar grill in the lobby.- The pool (which is on the 6th floor, not the roof) on the first night looked like a swamp - but we swam at our own risk as the temperature was near 112 degrees. It was drained and remained empty for the next 3 days.- When we complained to Frances, the front desk supervisor, she awarded us with 2 $22.00 vouchers for dinner at their restuarant Pralines, only to be told 30 seconds later, by Frances herself, that the restuarant would not be open for dinner. But we could feel free to eat at the sports bar (which is where the hair showed up in the turkey sandwich).There's plenty more but I'm beginning to relive it and feel queasy. We were offered a free 3 night stay with them in the future to make up for our disappointing time, but I'd rather spend time in Central Park in good old NYC than go back to that DUMP again. Do NOT stay at this place, even if it's all you can afford. Save for an extra month or 2 and stay closer to the Quarter and as far away from the Park Plaza as possible.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR538167409", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "It's not that bad My stay at the Park Plaza Hotel in New Orleans in July 2005 was okay. I only paid $100 a night so I wasn't expecting the Sheraton. It was not a luxury hotel and it served its purpose. I was there with another couple for the Essence Music Festival. There was so much activity outside of the hotel, I only stayed there long enough to get a couple of z's. The location of the hotel was pretty good. It was 3-4 blocks from the Superdome and 5-6 blocks from Bourbon Street, plus the street car was directly in front of the hotel. We were able to get around pretty easily either walking or catching the street car. My biggest complaint is that the walls are paper thin. I could hear the couple next door. a little too clearly if you know what I mean. However, my friends did not have the same problem with the thin walls.

I requested a renovated room, I can't imagine that is what I got, but it wasn't that bad. It was chipped and scratched, but comfortable with nice cherry wood furnture. A healthy person with comfortable shoes on will have no problem with the walk to the quarter. We walked all over the quarter, over to Frenchmen Street, to the French Market, the riverfront, and to the casino from there all in one night with no problem. I just had to forgo those cute high heels I was planning to hang out in. The hotel is a a block or two from the Ritz Carlton and the Fairmount, some of the better hotels in town, but in between these hotels and the Park Plaza is a spot where a lot of young soul brothers hang out and drink. They are probably harmless but might appear dangerous. There are also some ghetto fabulous jewelry shops, nail salons, and wig shops right adjacent to the Park Plaza, giving the immediate neighborhood a ghetto feel. But this zone is tiny. You are out of it in minutes. Parking is a pain. Be prepared to pay. The staff is nice and will go a bit but not too far out of their way to be helpful. All in all if you are a budget traveler and get a budget rate, this place will suit your needs, if you are not there are many nicer places to stay.We heard some wonderful teenage jazz musicians playing in the street at Canal and Bourbon, where you would enter the quarter if walking from the Park Plaza.

While it wasn't the Ritz, it was a great hotel and a super value. We felt safe here, especially compared to some other parts of New Orleans. Remember to be careful wherever you go in New Orleans. The trolley was convenient and easy to use. If we didn't feel like using the trolley we walked to the French Quarter and Bourbon Street, a short safe walk. New Orleans is a great place to visit and be prepared for a pretty wide open town. Bourbon Street was way too much fun and the Swamp tours, Plantations and Aquarium were wonderful.

After reading the many, many negative reviews, we expected the worse. The negative reviews are right on target. Like others have said, the place is a dump, located near the projects, about five very long blocks from the French Quarter/ Central Business District. When we checked into the hotel, kids from the neighborhood were in the lobby begging for money right under the eye of the doorman (who I rarely saw opening the door during our stay). The deluxe room we were assigned on the 3rd floor was totally unacceptable, not only because it provided a view of a large HVAC unit just a a few feet beyond our window, but because of the smell, frayed carpet, peeling wallpaper, moldy bathroom, leaking toilet, and rattling HVAC vent. The lady at the front desk was apparently used to complainers like us because she promptly reassigned us, no questions asked, to a deluxe room on the 16th floor, which was even more unihabitable than the original room assignement due to the strong stench of urine in the hallway. Upon returning to the lobby, we complained to a very nice woman wearing a hotel badge, who turned out to be the security manager. She introduced us to the hotel manager, who was very sympathetic and reassigned us to a deluxe room on the 9th floor, which was significantly better than the two other rooms, but still one of the worst hotel rooms we have ever stayed in. Other than offering a large ballroom for the event we were attending, the hotel amenities were sparse. The breakfast buffet was edible, but that particular restaurant closes after lunch, leaving the cafeteria located in the bar as the only other on-site place to eat. The bar area, however, smelled like rotting seaweed, which pretty much killed the desire to eat the stuff they sell as food.As others have pointed out, the neighborhood is a serious concern. While we did not experience any problems the few times we walked to the French Quarter during the day, the potential for crime is certainly high, day or night, particularly for the elderly and those who are small in size or physically weak. Although the street car does stop in front of the hotel for a relatively safe form of transport up and down canal street even at night, a taxi is the only sure bet for safe travel.I suspect that many people who book at the Park Plaza shop for price and think they are getting a bargain. For as little as $15 more per night, however, there are plenty of other hotels located in or very close to the French Quarter/Central Business Distrct that are much nicer than this dump.", "Date": "Jul 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR116952509", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Laby"}, {"Content": "More work to go on this vacation I visited New Orleans and stayed at this hotel with my best friend during the last week of June. Out of the 5 days that I had booked, we only stayed for 4 days. This is my first time posting to this site and after reading some of the other reviews, I noticed that a lot of my problems were the same. I had specifically told the agent when I made the arrangements that we would be needing late check in. Upon arrival to the hotel, I even called an hour ahead to confirm and remind. When we arrived we were met with a double booked room. I had to wait 45 minutes to finally be helped and then another 10 minutes until they could tell me which room due to this problem on their part. There was not any valet/bell hop service to speak of upon arrival. We didn't even know where to park our car if there was self park. My best friend was shuttled back to the hotel from self park by someone of valet service in that person's own personal car. This made me feel completely uneasy. When we reached our room, it had peeling paint on the door, the security bolt had been pulled away from the door rendering it useless, a large sticky damp stain on the carpet in front of the bathroom and our closet had also been used as a restroom complete with a urine permeating smell. The bed was not comfortable and, it did feel like you were sleeping on box springs. Our ice bucket nor our glasses that were in the room were sanitized or changed out. Our door key also did not work on quite a few occassions and the door would not close completely due to the security bolt that would get in the way of closing the door.The pool was filthy. Out of the 4 days that we were there the jacuzzi worked only 2. The pool area was not picked up and after the towels ran out they were left littering the area for 3 days straight. There was a definate saltiness about the water in the pool.

We booked a room for $59/night (conference rate), thinking it would be on par with a Best Western or Travel Lodge (i.e. no frills but clean). 3 stars? Not in a developed country! This hotel has no standards. There is certainly a good reason that it is no longer a Radisson property. It needs several million $ in upgrades to make it fit for human habitation. We requested a quiet room away from the elevators (we read the reviews here also--yes the walls are very thin). The most disturbing part of our stay was the cockroach (dusty and dead for quite some time - presumably from the filth), renovated bathroom (complete with hairs from previous guests) and stained towels (semi-white towels with yellowish stains). Rooms are dark, with two phones (yet only one bedside light), disgustingly dingy bathrooms (with mildew), dirty windows and dirty/dusty furniture. We packed up the morning after water started dripping from our bathroom ceiling...we were told it was bathwater from the room above (the guest failed to properly use the shower curtain). Instead of packing our things and moving to another room, we packed and moved to another hotel (The Fairmont is 2 blocks away--well worth twice the price). The staff are nothing to write home about either! When we checked out, we had a mysterious $5 food and beverage charge, nothing big, but we certainly would not consume anything prepared from this hotel. This charge was charged seperately to our credit card after we had checked out - our credit card company is currently investigating. Interestingly, the clerk who checked us out (and removed the questionable charge) was dubbed the Improvement Manager.

The concierge also was very helpful with restaurant choices around town, and all were excellent! We enjoyed the hotel sports bar, the pool, the hot tub, the fitness center and excellent room service. The streetcar was very convenient and took us just about everywhere we needed to go so fortunately a rental car was not needed for our stay. We did have to take a cab a few times and all the doormen were great at hailing one for us. Three small things that I was not real happy with: 1) The laundry room was very small and hot and needed a good paint job, and the dryers were broken the evening we tried to do laundry and it took maintenance a while to take care of that, but the staff was nice enough to dry my clothing in the house laundry and bring to my room later. 2) The business center internet service charged me $10.60 to check my email (WHOA!!!) which took me less than 3 minutes. 3) Housekeeping was very prompt when we needed anything, but I did have to call the supervisor to tell them to keep the loud talking and laughter down at 8 a.m. two mornings in a row right outside our door, which was close to the elevator.Other than that, we truly enjoyed our stay, would recommend this hotel, and would likely stay again on our next visit to beautiful New Orleans.", "Date": "Jun 2, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR586970709", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nightowl800"}, {"Content": "The Worst Hotel I've ever stayed in!

I've been reading some posts on this site recently about various properties and, having stayed at the Raddison, nee Plaza, over Labor Day weekend, I am compelled to respond. First of all, I got an extremely good rate ($50s per night) a few months earlier. Thank God I didn't happen on this site before hand or I'm sure I would've cancelled. My room was on the top floor, overlooking the pool deck and Canal St and was immaculately clean, stocked with soap, shampoo, clean fresh plump towels, what you would expect. The decor and furnishing were fine and exactly as depicted on this site. When I first got to the room my key wouldn't open it, but fortunately the maid was there and let me in. I unpacked and called down to the desk and then just went down and got it replaced. That was the extent of my problems with the Hotel. Oh, I forgot that I had to go down a few floors to find a working ice machine. Tres` horrible!Two of the four morons staying in the next room managed to wake me up at 4AM every morning (finally I turned on CNN and blasted it loudly for an hour) but that's not the Hotel's fault. I could've asked to be moved probably...but didn't. Without exception all of the staff were gracious and cordial and extremely helpful, from maids (one gave me a tour of the empty Presidential Suite; it had been occupied earlier during my stay) to bellmen, doormen, wait staff, cashiers, front desk, etc. It was hot that time of year and the large pool deck is a perfect amenity...comfortable lounges and chairs and the pool was cool and a wonderful respite from sightseeing. I met some expatriate New Orleanians (attended culinary school) and they seemed perfectly content lounging beside the pool at the Raddison. The breakfast buffet was superb...fresh fruit and pastries, eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, grits, hash-browned potatoes  mouth-watering biscuits  sausage gravy. They bring you a large juice if you wish and a carafe of coffee. I feasted there every morning and never needed lunch. Oh, I forgot, one morning the scrambled eggs were cold. Maybe the sterno extinguished or, more likely, some moron didn't replace the cover on the serving dish. With all the other dishes it was hardly noticed. I think the brunch cost $13 minus tip. One night to avoid the restaurant mobs I ate in the Hotel. The Lobster bisque was rich and creamy and full of nice succulent chunks of white lobster meat. My NY steak was perfectly done medium-rare and surrounded (but not topped) with a Vin marchant sauce. Excellently prepared and served. For dessert I had coffee and 'Chocolate Decadence' -- devils food cake garnished with fresh strawberries  dripped sauce and fresh whipped cream. Do you think I'd remember its name if it weren\u9225\u6a9b as exquisite as it sounds?And lest anyone think it was a quiet Holiday weekend in town there was Southern Decadence in the FQ and a nation-wide Baptist convention occurring and the Hotel was full. I guess the elevators were a bit slow, perhaps that's to be expected of a property on the National Register of Historic Places.

Dirty! I think Motel 6 would have been better following is a letter I sent to the corporate offices the day we got home from NO. October 19, 2004To Whom it May Concern;This past weekend we spent our first weekend in New Orleans. While reservations were made, we saw the Radisson name and automatically thought it was a reputable name. We looked up the hotel online through your website and saw pictures of beautiful rooms and amenities. We could not have been more disappointed when we arrived. First of all, we reserved a non-smoking room with a King bed. There were no non-smoking rooms available when we arrived so had to spend the first night in a smoking room, before moving to a non-smoking room for the following two days. The inconvenience of that alone was enough, but when we walked into a room barely big enough to fit the bed, that was beyond filthy, we were VERY upset. We asked if there were any suites in the hotel and we were told an emphatic NO! Both of the rooms we stayed in had black fuzzy mold growing from the AC vent and in the bath tub grout. Breathing that type of moldy air, with that allergies I suffer, put a huge damper on my weekend. The smell in both rooms was over powering. I even asked for clean sheets, blankets and comforter that did not seem to help. The bathroom sink hung over the toilet making for an uncomfortable \u9225\u6e1eelief\u9225?time. The beds felt like springs covered with a cloth. Overall dusty, and dirty! We did make an effort to try to find another hotel, but seeing all the events in town, the nice hotels were all full. Our reservation was made through hotels and was also pre-paid, which would have made for a difficult recovery of our money. We feel you have inappropriately depicted your hotel on your website. You should show pictures of what people are really going to get. We spent almost 600.00 for a weekend in your hotel to have a horrible stay. To top it off, when we checked out, we were told that we couldn\u9225\u6a9b even collect our Gold Points, because our reservation was not made directly through Radisson. What a rip-off! We spent the money and should receive the points. We will NEVER stay at Radisson New Orleans again. We may even change our summer vacation in Lido Beach to another resort. That is how disappointed we are. I will also let you know that even the Taxi Cab drivers know what a dump your hotel is. He said he has heard it from EVERY person who has ever stayed there.

The elevators were not slow, there was plenty of clean water, no cockroaches or ants, no mold except the little bit mentioned above. There was one spot of water damage to a wall in the hall. The rest was fine. The pool and jacuzzi were in operation and clean with a nice rooftop view. The location was fine for us; we did not feel unsafe and we walked or took the trolly everywhere.

It was definitely a double/full, however when I called to state the room was not as expected I was informed it's a standard queen, in a rude tone. Although definitely not the case, we let it drop as the only other available rooms were behind the elevator shaft and very noisy. When we finally laid down on the bed (in a room that was approximately 12 feet by 14 feet) there were spring sticking up all over the mattress.There was a hair brush on the floor at the edge of the bed. You can hear every flush of every toilet above, below, and beside your room.The pool had dirty towels in the bottom, the hottub was out of service.When calling for a wakeup call I was placed on hold for more than five minutes.

The elevators were a liitle slow during peak hours, but I never had to wait more than three or four minutes.

Like everyone else who has posted on this website, I was very concerned with the negative comments I was reading as our trip approached. In fact, I even called a friend in N.O. to see if we could use his apartment in case the hotel was a dump. Well, I am happy to report that our stay exceeded all my expectations. The room was clean and appeared to have been renovated within the last few years. The Lobby was nice. The staff was extremely friendly. My wait time to check in was about 10 minutes. The only problems we encountered were a slow drain in the tub and slow elevator service. It seemed to me that of the 4 elevators only 2 were working most of the time. The hotel's location isn't the greatest, but I never felt unsafe. There were a few panhandlers, but that was about it. If you don't want to walk, you can take the new Canal Street street car that stops right in front of the hotel, or you can take a cab. The doormen were always happy to flag down a cab for us. The walls are paper thin, but noise was never a problem. I did talk to a group that a had a problem with mold in their room, but the hotel was able to move them to another room.In conclusion, I feel like we got an amazing bargain for a hotel so close to the quarter during Jazzfest.

Yes, the rooms are smaller than those in newer buildings, but this is a landmark hotel... accomodations just weren't as spacious back in the 1920s. The furnishings do need an update (especially the well-worn carpeting), but everything was clean when I arrived and my room was attended to every day while I was out. The rooftop pool had just opened for the season when I arrived . The pool was clean (but cold) and towels were available for guests at poolside. The staff was friendly.

I stayed here for 4 nights (4/16 through 4/20) through Priceline. It was listed as a 3* and I paid $40 per night. I would rate it more like a 2* and would never pay full price for it (Expedia was charging an average of $135 per night.Although check-in is officially 4pm, they let us check in at 12:30pm. However, only a full size bed was available. We stayed on the 4th floor. The room was pretty small and old looking, but it was generally clean and the maids were friendly. We hung the SHH sign on the door all 3 days and weren't bothered by housekeeping. However, on the last night there the neighbors were pretty loud (the walls are indeed paper thin). You have to drown out the rude people who talk on the phone at 4am by using the air conditioning (which works well).The location is about a 10 minute walk to the French Quarter. Upon first review it seems you have to walk through bad neighborhoods to get to the French Quarter, but we never had any problems, even at night. They do run a free shuttle once an hour which we took several times. It was convenient and the driver was very friendly (as like most people down there). It makes a stop at Harrah's and in the French Quarter. However, if you miss it, it's not a bad walk back. They just started running the street car up Canal Street so you can take that for $1.25. And, if you want to walk back instead, I would suggest walking up along the tracks of the street car (which runs up in the middle of the street and provides plenty of space to walk). No one bothers you there and plenty of people use the tracks to walk up.I tried to check out by using the tv, but it was too slow, so I went downstairs to check out. They do charge you a $2 tourist fee per night which each hotel charges. It's not included in your Priceline Taxes. However, for $40 per night, an extra $2 tax is not a big deal.The pool was a bit small and I didn't end up using it. We just lounged by the pool. Most of the time the elevators were fine, but one day a huge group was checking in and the lobby was wall to wall people. We had to use the stairs because the lines were crazy. Others higher up were using the service elevator. We didn't use the hotel restaurant or room service because the French Quarter has so many good restaurants.Finally, this hotel is about 3 blocks from the city bus line which runs to and from the airport. Because we didn't have a lot of luggage we opted to use that, which was $1.60 each way. At the airport, it comes about every 25 minutes and is the E-2 Airport Express. You pick it up outside door 7. Going to the airport, you pick it up on Tulane Ave. across from the library.

While waiting in line to check in, I overhead people talking about the hotel not having water for the past 2 days. Upon my check-in, nothing was mentioned about a water problem. When I entered my room, I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet full of someone else's waste. The room had no running water at all. When I called to complain, I was told we're sorry, they are working on it. I called back about 3 hours later to complain again. I was told it should be working. No one even offered me bottled water. Finally, 6 hours after I had checked in, I went down to the desk to complain again, and they offered to move me to the airport hotel. This was completely unacceptable, as I was in town for a convention. She then offered to move me to one of the only rooms they had left, which was a smoking room (I do not smoke and do not like to be in a room that smells like smoke). At this point I was willing to accept any room that had running water. When I got to this room, the room number on the door had fallen off and the room number was written on the door with magic marker. Upon entering the room, I found the toilet running constantly like a geyser, making a very loud noise. I had to close the bathroom door and stuff a towel around the bottom of the door to drown out the noise. This went on until about 3:00 AM, at which time it finally stopped. The elevators were very slow, and sometimes the wait for an elevator was 10-15 minutes. I overheard many people complaining about the hotel. In fact, one man in the elevator told me that he travels all over the world, and the Radisson New Orleans was absolutely the worst hotel he had ever stayed in. I have to agree that without a doubt this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in either. The second day I was there, I was trying to rest in my room in the afternoon when the clock radio in the next room went off. It was so loud that it sounded like it was right by my bed. After about 30 minutes of this, I finally figured out that no one was in that room and I had the maid go in there and turn it off. Then, the next afternoon, the same thing happened again! I again had to find a maid to turn it off. On two different occasions my room key would not work. Twice I had to return to the lobby at the end of a very long, tiring day to get a key that would open the door. The blanket on the bed was dirty and discolored. The bathroom sink did not have a drain trap in it. I dropped an earring and of course it went right down the sink drain. There was mildew around the tub. The whole experience was so bad as to be almost laughable. I have stayed in Radisson Hotels before and have always found them to be pleasant. However, this experience has made me extremely hesitant to ever stay in a Radisson Hotel again. They really should be ashamed to have the Radisson name associated with this place.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR314039575", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Worst Hotel Ever!

A friend and I stayed at the Radisson in New Orleans during the Halloween weekend, from 10/30-11/04/03. The moment we arrived at the hotel we knew something was wrong but just couldn't put our fingers on it. The hotel is apparently currently under EXTENSIVE renovations, which is not mentioned on Radissons home site, where we booked our reservations. The indoor pool is closed and apparently will be for some time to come. But all that is small potatos to the hundreds of small black ants that awaited us when we entered our room on the 18th floor. They were everywhere and we discovered how numerous they were when we made the mistake of leaving a some food out on a desk. When we returned that evening they had completely covered the desk and were all over the chair next to it. We called room service to change rooms, but they were booked solid and since it was a pretty busy weekend most others hotels were the same way. Needless to say we had the hotel staff do what they could to remedy our problems, but nothing really came of their solutions, which were to lay down pellets and spray to kill the thriving insect population living under the carpet and who knows were else. As I have stayed in many hotels I would habe to say that this is single handedly the worst experience I've had and the reason I will never stay at another Radisson.

I did not notice the musty mildew smell other reviewers have mentioned. It's a lovely old National Register building. Our room was large, clean and well furnished (2 double plus sofabed) but did have a few maintenance issues. Staff is friendly and eager to please but could be better trained. Maid service especially erratic - every day there was something they failed to provide (towels, coffee supplies, glasses, toiletries, etc.). Restaurant very good and reasonable prices; same menu for room service just a bit higher. Neighborhood is a bit dodgy but after all, it's New Orleans. Should improve when Canal St. streetcar begins running in early 2004. It's about a six block walk to the Quarter (okay in daytime). I did not try the shuttle but it seemed to run frequently. Biggest problems are understaffed front desk, rooms not ready at check-in time, and too few working elevators. This got worse when busloads of Falcons fans arrived from Georgia for the Saints game that weekend. If they would fix these problems it could be a good tourist-class hotel.

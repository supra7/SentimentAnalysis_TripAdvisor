The hotel is in a great location right on the edge of the bay within easy reach of the cruise ships and day trip boats, a short walk from the USS Midway aircraft carrier/museum and about 10 - 15 minutes walk from the Gas Lamp district. The hotel itself contains an English style pub/restaurant which serves food until 11 pm and is reasonably priced and does breakfast.

Not a problem if you are coming or going on a cruise ship, except for the occasional times that the ships blow their horns! Finally I was there during an unseasonable cold spell with strong winds. The sliding glass door in the room was so decrepit that the wind blew right in all around the opening. Kept the room so cool I had to put the heat in the room up to 76! The property has CLEARLY seen better days. The neighborhood (if you can call it that) is not inviting and it is a bit of a hike to the trolley around parking lots, etc that are not very friendly at night. Plus side???? the restaurant/bar (Elephant and Castle Pub) has a nice selection of beers and a good happy hour special (imported draft beer for $4.25).

On my first day, the toilet overflowed the very first time I used it. It was room 1052. If that room gets assigned to you, goodluck! We called the operator and maintenance promptly fixed the problem but ofcourse there was toilet water all over the floor. Disgusting. We called back to ask for housekeeping but the operator said she already sent someone to fix the problem, she could not understand that we needed someone to clean up the mess. Did she think it was ok for us to have toilet water on our bathroom floor? We asked for the manager and she was so embarassed with what happened and transferred us to a room facing the bay. Overall, the room felt dated, there was no minibar, not too much places to eat around the area. the view of the bay was the only redeeming factor. The airport shuttle was convenient though, the staff was nice enough to answer our questions but they were always so busy. Understaffed?

Directly in front of the hotel is the Star of India (Maritime Museum). PLUSES: 1. The hotel is conveniently located to the cruise terminal. It would be an easy walk provided you do not have too much luggage. There is a cruise parking area located very close to the hotel. 2. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the airport, seaport village, Horton Plaza, and Balboa Park (leaves at 9 or 11 AM and returns at 4:20 PM). 3. The rooms are large. The room we had was remodeled and included a large walk-in shower (no tub), king size bed, chair with ottoman, desk area, dresser and large flat screen TV. Our room was clean and odor-free. 4. The H.I. restaurant (Elephant & Castle) has a good happy hour ($ 4.50 beer/wine/mixed well drinks) from 4 - 7 PM. There is a wide selection of beers available. MINUSES 1. Parking (self or valet) is expensive. Neither parking area is fenced or secure. 2. Rooms facing the bay have a lot of road noise. North Harbor Drive is a busy road and the traffic can be heard all night. Rooms that face to city have the train tracks close by so you hear the train whistles and the railroad crossings. 3. The hotel is actually three buildings. The front building faces the harbor, the back building is a multi-story (lower floors face the front building, upper floors face the harbor or the city.) 4.

The front of house staff were great - friendly, knowledgeable and efficient and the hotel location is perfect. Arriving in the room was the first disappointment. Although the room was clean and the bed comfortable, the decor was dated and after an 11 hour flight from London, we just wanted a hot shower before sleeping. The water pressure in the shower was poor and it seemed as if there were only two temperature settings - scalding hot or freezing cold. There was no safe in the room, nor was there an in-room bar - things that we have come to take for granted in IHG hotels in Europe. At $22 per night, we found that the car parking was extortionate, but at least we were prepared for that. The biggest shock was at breakfast next morning. We had booked a room on the IHG website at a rate which was supposed to have included breakfast. Imagine our shock to discover that the breakfast included was only up to the value of $20 per room (per room - not per person)! It is served in a separately operated restaurant/bar off the main lobby and the buffet, to which we have become accustomed, was non-existent. The restaurant charged for absolutely everything on an a la carte basis and we soon exceeded the $20 and had to pay the difference. Having paid for a room with breakfast included, we were disgusted by this. The food was good and we ate on the terrace outside but even that experience was spoiled by two pigeons on a nearby table devouring the remains of another couple's food. In conclusion, if you're looking for a good hotel, go elsewhere. We chose this one because our previous Holiday Inn experiences have been good, but don't waste your money on it.

This is the best location for cruisers as it is right across the street from the cruise ship terminal. It is also well located, if you do not mind walking a few blocks, to Horton Plaza, Gas Lamp, Seaport Village and Little Italy. A special mention to the concierge desk. They were flooded by dozens of people wanting to drop off or pick up luggage, obtain visitor info or answers to questions. We waited at least 10 minutes to drop off our bags. I was very impressed by how pleasant, respectful and patient they all were. Not everyone in line was very nice yet they treated everyone well. Kudos to them all! Here are the pro's and cons: PROS Great staff - every staff person we encountered was friendly, helpful and very patient: front desk, concierge, gift shop, housekeeping you name it. Nice property amenities - pretty pool, self laundry, better than usual gift shop, three restaurants on site and others close by. Location - as mentioned above good location View from room - we splurged on a bay side room. It is really cool to sit on our balcony and watch the cruise ships come in and leave. You can also see airplanes do the same thing. We saw dolphins following a boat out of the harbor in the morning! CONS Price - we booked through the hotel website as there were no deals on the usual hotel sites. Paid $160 for our bay view room. Room - we were on the third floor of tower three. It was bit noisy especially from the construction next door. While the room was large it seemed a bit dated. No microwave or fridge though there is s safe. Crowds - this is a place popular with cruisers. Cruise ships hold lots of people and it seemed that everyone on both our ship and the other ship that was in port were at the hotel. There were lineups to check in and to the concierge. There seemed to be people everywhere all of the time. I recommend this hotel if you are leaving or coming back from a cruise or plan to visit the USS MIdway or like watching the ships and planes or like a retro-vibe. There are better locations if you want to spend your time at the Gas Lamp area or if you want a \"cool\" hotel. This hotel feels like a little resort in the middle of a City.

This Holiday Inn is actually a complex, where you do your check-in in what I think was an original building with rooms, and they also have 2 other towers with rooms as well. One of the towers is attached to the old building, which was separated by conference room facilities, the other is not. Check In-I arrived around 2pm thursday afternoon, and while there was a line to check in, there were 5 people checking people in, so the line moved very rapidly. They gave me my room key, a code for the wireless internet, and a 10% discount coupon for a deli that is on the complex. They also give you shuttle pick-up times for the airport, the zoo, sea world, and a couple other locations. Shuttles are free. The room-I have read other reviews about the rooms here at the Holiday Inn, and I have to say, they are pretty spot on. I got the king sized bed, which I found firm, but not overly hard. They give you 4 square pillows, 2 firm, 2 soft. The chair, tables, and dresser are straight from the late 70's or early 80's. Yes, they are dated, but they serve their function. It's a Holiday Inn, what do people expect, Pottery Barn furniture. There was a 32\" LCD TV with about 30 channels along with the standard pay per view movies, which ran around $17 a pop. The room has its own thermostat, which ran smoothly and quietly. People have said about the thin walls. While I didn't hear any noise from my next door neighbors, I definitely heard the Amtrak train blowing it's horn every 30-45 minutes. Yes folks, I had a city view room with the Amtrak station only 1 block away, and its a very busy station. In addition to Amtrak, there was the local commuter train, and the red trolley line. And I have to admit, it got a little irritating. Hint, keep your balcony room locked, as all balconies are attached to each other, and it would be easy for a not so nice person to come from a different room from the outside to get into your room, if your balcony door was left unlocked. The Bathroom-I was up on the 12th floor of the tower that was attached to the first building, I didn't find problems getting hot water, but I found the water pressure being a little lacking. Same for the toilet, when you flushed, it took forever to complete the cycle. The bathroom was equipped with a shower only, which is not a problem for me. My opinion is, unless its a whirlpool tub, why bother. Standard sink, and hairdryer hanging on the wall. There was also a ironing board located in the bathroom closet. Hotel Overall-I don't know if it was color scheme, but the hotel just looked old. The hotel has a swimming pool and also a workout gym. The hotel also has a Elephant and Castle attached to the hotel, but is not a part of Holiday Inn. I ate there, and had fantastic meals. The Hotel also has room service, which I was told, comes out of a different kitchen. There is also a Ruth's Chris' steakhouse restaurant on the complex. As a stated earlier, I got a code at checkin for wireless internet, which was free for my entire stay, which was a pleasant surprise. I had no problems connecting, and had good coverage. The hotel is directly across for the cruise terminal, the maritime museum, and the Midway museum. The Carnival Spirit and Holland America's Statendam were leaving on my first night. The hotel is also within walking distance to the Gas Lamp Quarter section of San Diego.

When I first arrived, there was only one out of three elevators working. At one point during my stay, none was working and they were directing people to the service elevator. Another time two were working which was a HUGE improvement. Being on the 10th floor, I didn't mind walking down, but wasn't as keen on walking up. The room I was given was literally next to the ice machine. It was not as much of a big deal as I thought it might be, but I definitely could hear when people were getting ice. It was interesting though because my room did NOT have an ice bucket. I wondered what other guests were using to get ice or if my room was the only one lacking. It is a noisy hotel with lots of guests of all ages including children. I didn't mind that much as I'd read the reviews and seen that this was an issue so I was prepared. There was also some street type noise, but I didn't mind that either as it is downtown and only the most brand new hotels with the best insulation and windows are noise proof. You can hear airplanes taking off at Lindbergh Field. You can hear the ships whistle on the cruise ship. You can even hear the announcements on the cruise ship if you have your window open. It is a typical old style downtown hotel. I was not expecting tranquility. The restaurant left a lot to be desired. The morning breakfast was expensive and also the waiter I had was less than personable. He didn't understand - or chose NOT to understand - my order. I simply wanted two eggs and toast, but received hashbrowns and bacon which I did not want. In this day of increasing obesity, many people, myself included, are trying to eat less. So if I don't want hashbrowns and bacon, DON'T give it to me. It is a waste of food and probably money. This hotel has a good location if you enjoy the waterfront and being close to activities such as the Maritime Museum and the USS Midway Museum. These are within walking distance.

Also the sink stopper didn't work and the sink itself had rust coming through the porcelain. It was hard to sleep because the trains going by sounded like they were just outside my window. I thought maybe the sliding glass door was open, but when I checked the door seal was missing so there was an open half-inch gap which didn't block any noise.

The 1st was a bit better because I was in the north tower which had been recently remodeled and was just nicer than the south tower. Customer comfort, like comfortable seating, was definetly taken into account when remodelling the north tower. Still, I had few complaints. When I mentioned to the young man checking me in that I was celebrating my 65 birthday with them and would appreciate a bay view, I felt he did his best to accommodate me with a nice room on the 5th floor facing the bay even though I was there on a pretty good Expedia rate. The views of the bay, cruise ships across the street, sunsets and people were truly a plus that I constantly enjoyed from my little balcony with two chairs and a little table. This a 100% non-smoking hotel and I would suggest that if you choose to smoke on your balcony, and some do, be very discreet and considerate about it. You don't want neighbors complaining about your smoking. I have no doubt that they would charge you the fees that you initial for upon checking in if caught. One morning I woke up to 3 cruise ships docked at the terminal right across the street. What a sight that was. All wasn't perfect though. Flights start leaving the closeby airport right at 06:30 every morning which can be a bit of an unpleasant wakeup. A lot of the airport noise seems to depend on wind direction but I always noticed those early morning flight departures and the jet noise. I found all of the staff that I had dealings with to be efficient and friendly. I very much liked the deli at the base of our building. I had breakfast there a couple times which was made even better sitting outside on their patio on a warm San Diego morning. Their sandwiches are excellent. Never failed to satisfy. My only real dissatisfaction with this hotel relates to their $1.50 charge for local phone calls and $22.00 per day for parking. My rental car didn't even cost that much per day. Parking can be a real hassle if you try to use the city meters which are everywhere outside the hotel and charge 25 cents for 12 minutes which adds up. If you get a ticket for an expired meter I've been told it's over $40.00. There is a pay lot south of the hotel with an entrance off Broadway Street which charges $10.00 for up to 10 hours with no in and out privilages and served my needs a few times when I had parked overnight at the meters which kick in at 08:00 everyday expect Sunday. The rooms are adequate and very clean. Mine had a nice, new flat screen TV which my room in the north tower didn't have when I stayed there 2 years ago. The maid was most sweet and accommodating.

Well, first of all we were blown away by the location - all we could say was 'wow'! This hotel is spread over 2 adjacent buildings facing the bay and we were in the taller of the two with an external glass elevator, which from our point of view was an added bonus. Our room was perfect - on an upper floor with fantastic views right across the bay. If the decor was tired I certainly didn't notice. The room was also perfectly clean as far as I can recall and we weren't disturbed at all during our stay. Yes, there are aircraft coming in to land and we frequently heard the trains behind the hotel but it was all part of the experience to us. The staff were great - very friendly and helpful without exception. As we are Brits and were staying while 'that' wedding was happening in the UK (!) everyone wanted to talk to us, which was lovely. The fitness rooms beside the pool were very well equipped and the pool looked nice although I didn't quite find the time to try it out. We had such a lovely time in San Diego that we rearranged our travel plans and stayed for a third night which for us is unprecedented. It's well worth doing both harbour tours - the commentary was incredibly informative and enthusiastic and we saw Navy Seals and dolphins being trained amongst many other things.

The location of this hotel cannot be faulted, close to the airport and within easy reach of Downtown. On our second stay we paid extra for a room with a view over the Bay (12th floor), which was wonderful, although we hadn't allowed for the loud noise from the air conditioning units on the low roof opposite us which made sleep almost impossible. The hotel also provides a really useful free shuttle bus service between the airport and a few other key tourist locations, like the zoo, which runs regularly. There were a few silly ommissions such as milk to go with the coffee in the room, another really useful facility by the way. And long waits for the elevators which are under repair. Unfortunately, our dissatisfaction lay with the surly and curt staff that we encountered on both stays. On the first occasion when we asked if the concierge had a local map, without a word he slapped one on the counter and turned his back on us before we could speak, and started a conversation with another guest. Any thoughts of asking for help were put to bed and we moved on. We pointed out that our bill included 2 days of the valet service instead of 1 (an expensive service at $28 per day), the emotionless Receptionist fumbled with her keyboard for a good five minutes in complete silence before printing of a new bill and leaving it on the counter - an apology was clearly out of the question. When we asked if we could keep our room for one extra hour beyond check out. The same Receptionist didn't consult with anyone or check her screen even, the answer was simply \"no, that's not possible\". After spending 4 reasonably expensive nights at the hotel and entertaining friends and family within the hotel restaurants, I didn't feel that one extra hour was a lot to ask for, and it would have made our transfer to the airport that much more comfortable as we could have used the time available in a more relaxed fashion. There was also an occasion when I stood infront of 2 chatting receptionists for about 2 minutes, waiting to ask a question, not once did they acknowledge me, look at me or of course stop talking. I moved to another counter to be served. What makes me laugh about all of this is that on check in they insist on thanking you for being a member of their Preferred Client scheme, but then after this you're on your own and nothing backs this up.

Location is excellent as it is not more than a 10 minute drive from the airport and the hotel is directly across the street from B Street Cruise Ship Terminal, allowing us to roll our luggage across the street and line up for embarking. Our arrival at the hotel was a couple of hours earlier than check-in but our room was ready which was nice. The room we had was a bay-view room with a large sliding glass door that lead onto a good sized balcony over looking the embarkado or bay area of San Diego, with views of the airport, and beautiful sunsets in the evenings. The room was very spacious and clean, not what I would consider high end, but a comfortable bed and adequate for the 2 days that we were there. The elevators in our building - the South Tower (there are 3 separate buildings that comprise this hotel) were slow and sometimes stopped at a floor that we had not chosen, which was odd! The hotel has a great gift shop, quite large, and we were pleased to see that they also had a nice selection of wines to choose from. We noticed that there are not a lot of convenience stores in the area of the hotel, so it was nice having the convenience of the shop that has a large range of goods from clothing, food /snack items to souveniers. We really enjoyed having meals at the Elephant & Castle Restaurant which is part of the hotel. Service was very good, excellent waiter who even remembered which wine we had ordered the night before! The food was high quality, loved the quesidillas and the house salad dressing. The restaurant also has an outdoor patio in front. Another plus for the location of the hotel is that the marine museum is also right there across the street, and a Hop on Hop off bus stop if you want to see the sights. Having said that, the hotel is on a main street and one of the nights we were there, a party event was going on across the street in one of the buildings on the water and we could hear the bass, if we had the sliding door open. The staff at the hotel were helpful in providing maps and information regarding transit and locations available for touring on our own.

It has several very nice amenities that I have taken advantage of: the lobby is excellent for meeting and visiting; the handsome and comfortable bar offers premium drinks and beers from around the world as well as billiards and electronic darts for entertainment; and the in-house restaurant is just OK but quite frankly I give it higher marks for the variety of its menu and convenience. The rooms, too are adequate but nothing to write home about. Poor lighting over the vanity and low water pressure in the sink were disappointing; while water pressure in the shower was simply excellent. On the negative side is the exterior noise: rooms which face downtown must endure the noise of the train as it passes close by throughout the night, and rooms which face the bay are surprisingly blasted by noise as one car after another crosses over the \"temporary\" steel plates covering the street, which have been there for years. While the bay view might be enticing, the city view is equally attractive and may be preferable especially when considering it is sheltered from the afternoon heat and cost less than the bay view rooms. The location of this hotel is great for cruises and bayfront activities, but if you plan to spend most of your time in the lively Gas Lamp entertainment district or in the wonderful mecca of shops, restaurants and cultural attractions in Old Town, then the Holiday Inn on the Bay is not the location you are looking for, as it is not within comfortable walking distance for most people. I have had only had one negative experience during the 8 or 10 times I have stayed here - a major housekeeping blunder which included leaving my room unlocked - and when I reported it to the management, they quickly and surely compensated me to my complete satisfaction.

Staying at the hotel was myself, my husband and his service dog. We are both in wheelchairs and found the hotel to be VERY wheelchair accessible for our needs. Our room had a bathtub, large turnaround area in the bathroom area and plenty of well-placed grab bars. The sink/vanity and mirror were just outside the bathroom door. This was very handy for us both getting ready at the same time. The height of the bed was perfect for transferring in and out of our wheelchairs. The hotel also offers a courtesy shuttle which is equipped with a lift. There were plenty of grassy areas just outside the door for the service dog. Coming into the room we were pleasantly surprised to be placed on the bayside where we had a beatiful view. I also was not expecting the wonderful balcony which was large enough for my wheelchair to roll completely outside. The hotel itself has a bright sunny exterior color which fit perfectly on the bay environment. Interiror, its public areas and hallways do need a bit of sprucing up and cleaning. Nothing major and certainly nothing that would keep me from recommending it to anyone. Mainly I just remember ceiling tiles and vents being dirty and the hallways having a slight musty smell. Nothing a good cleaning and air freshener system would not cure. The rest of the hotel was spotless. Every employee we encountered was nothing but top notch and went out of their way to help. The first person we encountered was a very nice gentlemen who, after bringing our luggage, went as far as to offer my husband's service dog a fresh bowl of water and kept asking if anyting at all was needed. Shuttle drivers-nothing but helpful and very pleasant. Front desk employees were friendly and attended to the few requests we had with promptness. We used the shuttle to go to and from the airport and the zoo. Both easy and pleasant experiences. We ate our first night at Anthony's, a fish place just across the street. There is an outdoor area as well as a sitdown indoor area. We ate outdoors. Very reasonably priced. Good fresh seafood. We ate breakfast on the last morning at a deli just down the sidewalk. It was a full service breakfast with inside as well as outdoor seating. Again good food and very reasonably priced. Although it is the only meal we ate there, we noticed they did have a large menu offering all sort of deli sandwiches. Would definitely eat there again for a quick bite. The purpose of our trip was a cruise. This hotel is directly across from the pier where the ship was docked. Upon waking, the cruise ship was the first thing we saw when we opened the curtains. We spent both evenings leisurely strolling the bay. There are a couple ship museums to tour and several local vendors set up along the bay area.

I thought to myself \"How bad could it be?\" It was \"Holiday Inn\" after all. You know, I'm not one to complain very often and this is also my first review of any hotel. I thought I owed it to everyone out there trying to decide what to do because I'd actually feel guilty if I didn't. With that said, here goes. I'm from Alberta, Canada and we were taken a Cruise out from San Diego and flew in a few days prior and we needed to stay somewhere for a day after the cruise was over. It seemed like a logical choice being right across the street from where the ship ports. We got into our room on the 8th floor in the South Tower. The room was clean but seemed to have gone through much wear and tear. No big Deal. Just not really nice in my opinion. (i.e. scratches and chips on the furniture, carpets in so-so shape, old t.v.'s, poorly conditioned sitting chairs etc. etc.) The Next thing, which everyone check's out is the bed. The bed was very uncomfortable, lumpy, and the pillows weren't that great and seemed somewhat small for a King. If you are someone who needs a comfortable sleep, I would think twice. Onward. It was rather hot the first day in and the next thing we did was turn on the Air Conditioner. It turned on and hot air came out. We gave it about 15 minutes and still only hot air blowing out. We called the front desk and the guy came out and said it needed to be turned on. He turned it on and the Air Conditioner started to work. \"Great\" we thought.. Until later that night we heard a \"drip, drip, drip\" in a pool on the floor. We called up the Front Desk a second time. They sent the maintenance guy again. He said, \"Oh, this one has had issues and it's actually been draining in a \"temporary bucket\" and the bucket is now over flowing\". I'm going \"peachy\". So, he goes an empties the bucket of water and on we go with the night. Well, we start to get to sleep around 11pm on our not so comfortable bed and all of a sudden we hear a \"drip, drip drip\" again in double time drips. I'm a patient guy but this time I'm just a little bit cranky and they gave us a choice to move rooms. We did of course. We moved to the North Tower and the air conditioner worked but the bed still sucked. We went on the cruise. Came Back and got our room again. This time on the 7th floor in the South Tower again. Bed was STILL was not very comfortable for the third time.. The air conditioner worked, which we didn't need because it was a cooler night but we just need to make the night. I REALLY wanted to sleep in because of all the days were doing excursions on our cruise we stayed really busy and were up early for one reason or another. Well, we got into bed, turned off the t.v. and then realized you could hear water running through the walls from somewhere. It wasn't just a little bit and it wasn't someone just turning on the tap or something. This was constant from the time we went to bed to the time we got up in the morning. I stayed in the room because I thought it would go off soon enough and it kept on waking me up all night. I was so bitter the next morning. I didn't complain because I just wanted to get out of there. Let's Recap: Uncomfortable, Water Leaks, Running Water in the Walls, Much Wear and Tear, and Generally not that nice. The Pro: Right Next to Ship Port Tip: Don't be afraid to use the Shuttle at a Different Hotel to make it to the port if you're taking a cruise for instance. The extra 15 - 30 minutes it'll take you to get ready in the morning and get there will be worth it if you get a good sleep somewhere else. P.S. - Did I mentioned the elevators seemed a little off? Seemed old and not very smooth running. (i.e. loud and/or bumpy) When you reached the floor on one of them the door took forever to open and it left you thinking you might be stuck for a split second. I'm sure they're fine by certain standards but it's one of those things you'd have to ride in and judge for yourself. Just my opinion. Again, this review isn't exaggerated. It's just my view of the experience and hope it helps you in making your decision.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cCan't beat the location and service for pre/post cruise lodging\u201d", "Author": "MissouriGoJoeGo", "ReviewID": "UR102470870", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights before and 2 nights after our cruise.

The check in went relatively smoothly and we were assured the room and harbor cruise were paid in advance and that the only other expenses would be incidentals and $22 a day for parking. On the first night Saturday the concierge a middle aged woman with an indiscernible accent and odor snapped at us when we asked if a particular restaurant would be crowded? Her response was \"it's Saturday night everywhere is crowded.\" We laughed it off to the amusement of another a guest who thought better of making any of her own inquiries. As it turned out the conceirge was half right it was Saturday but we didn't have to wait for a table. The rooms are dated with circa 1980s tvs and furnishings. The shower was fine and the view from the balcony very nice. The pocket sized fitness rooms appear to be a salute to the late Jack LaLanne's first health club. All that was missing was the vibrating waist belt. The Pub downstairs is the highlight of the place but I concede I didn't try the food. The true charm of this hotel came upon check out. The prepaid vacation was charged two times on separate cards after the staff member erroneously claimed the original card was declined. Mistakes happen but the demeanor and attitude of the front desk employee was accusatory, unprofessional and discourteous. It will be days before we can unwind her efforts.

You're also about a 10-15 minute walk from the Westfield Shopping Center, Gaslamp Quarter and a Ralph's/Kroger supermarket. You could almost walk to airport, it's that close. Front desk staff and housekeeping staff were all exceptionally pleasant. Parking is expensive, at $22 day, but if you're lucky, there's half a block of unrestricted free street parking on the north side of the hotel. Of course, the downside to being close to the Amtrak station is that you will hear the train horns. The first night we stayed, our room faced the back of the hotel (overlooking Pacific Highway) and we heard trains all night; we switched rooms for the remaining 3 nights of our stay. If you request a room that faces Harbor Drive, or overlooks the pool, then you should be fine. Pool is big enough to do laps; we never saw anyone in it the whole time we were there, but I imagine it is well-used by kids in the summer. The exercise room is well-equipped. Complimentary PC to quickly check email or print a boarding pass in the lobby. Rooms are OK - clean, reasonably sized with 2 full/double (not queen) beds, nice balcony with chairs, but starting to look a little scuffed and tired in places. Mattress was comfortable and there was an adequate array of soft and firm pillows on each bed. Thermostat was easy to use and worked fine. As other reviewers have noted, there's a sliding, frosted glass panel to the bathroom that doesn't lock. If you're travelling with someone, such as a work colleague, who you don't know well (or who you don't want to know well), you will probably find this room uncomfortable.

We recently stayed here two days before a cruise and one day upon returning from the cruise. The hotel is located directly across the street from the cruise ship terminal. If you get a \"bay view\" room (and I highly recommend that you pay the extra money for the bay view room), you will see the cruise ships docking and departing. While staying there we saw Holland American's Oosterdam (currently doing the Mexican Riviera cruises) and Holland American's Zaandam (currently doing rountrip Hawaii cruises) dock, discharge passengers, take on supplies and embark the new passengers. When we left the hotel to embark the Zaandam, we walked across the street with our suitcases, went through passport control, walked into the cruise terminal and entered our cruise cabin, all within 15 minutes of walking out of the Holiday Inn. In addition to being close to the cruise terminal, there are several Harbor Tour companies directly across the street from the hotel along with a stop for the \"tourist trolley\" that travels throughout the San Diego area. If you like to take public transportation, we saw several bus lines running directly in front of the hotel. In addition, the hotel runs a free shuttle to the Airport, the San Diego Zoo and the major shopping areas. The location truly cannot be beat. We were somewhat concerned about staying at a Holiday Inn since our previous experience with the chain has been very hit and miss. This hotel did not disappoint. While you are paying more for the location and the view (around $175 per night with taxes), the rooms are very comfortable and clean. Check-in was painless with our room being ready in the mid-afternoon when we arrived. The room had a king size bed, a desk with a desk chair, one comfortable chair and footstool, large TV (not a flatscreen), coffee maker and large closet. In the first room that we had, the closet was in the bedroom. In the second room that we had, the closet was in the bathroom. We had two different types of bathrooms. The first room had an outside sink with a toilet and tub/shower in a separate room with a regular door. The bathroom in the second room had the sink, toilet and walk-in shower in one room with a sliding door. The glass on the sliding door is opaque. I do prefer a regular door on a bathroom but for one night, it was fine. The balcony has two chairs and a small table. While the balcony is not large, there is plenty of room for two adults to sit and watch the harbor activity. The beds are comfortable and the linens actually fit the bed (you won't be remaking the bed in the middle of the night). Unfortunately we did have to listen to our neighbors returning from a late night (at 2:30 a.m. in the morning) so if you are bothered by hall and/or adjacent room noise, bring your earplugs. Generally speaking, the hotel is very quiet. Check-out is also painless. You will get a copy of your bill under your door the morning that you leave. To check out you call a number from your room phone, leave a message that you are checking out, close the door and go. There is no need to go to the front desk. Each and every staff member that we encountered including the front desk staff, the concierge, the room maids, the restaurant staff and the deli staff were very professional and accommodating. We were frequently asked if there was anything that we needed to make our stay more pleasant. There are multiple food choices at the hotel including a wonderful and hospitable restaurant just off the lobby, a deli located a few steps away outside with both indoor and outdoor dining, and a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse just next door. For those of you that are turned away from Ruth's Chris by the prices, eat at the bar. The bar menu is very reasonable and the bartenders will keep you entertained while you eat. The shrimp on the Shrimp Caesar Salad are the same shrimp used in the Shrimp Cocktail at about the same price for a full salad. You don't need a reservation to go in and eat at the bar. While the Holiday Inn On-The-Bay is not the Ritz, it is a very nice hotel given its location and views. It is obvious to me that Holiday Inn is trying to upgrade its image and get more consistency location to location. Before you stay here, join the Holiday Inn Priority Club (can be done on-line) and you will get some \"extras\" when you stay at the hotel (e.g., later check-out).", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "missouri", "Title": "\u201cGREAT LOCATION!

There's a bus stop right outside (Route 992) that will take you to the airport (although this HI has a shuttle that takes you for free). The hotel itself, well, it's a little dated. I've stayed there twice and was placed in the smaller 5 story North Tower both times. To be fair, I did use Priceline, so maybe I was given the \"Value Room\" (I joked that I was in the Priceline wing, since I was given the room adjacent to my last stay- same floor and everything!). The King size bed was comfy and so was the chair & ottoman. I like the little patio that I could see the bay from. Carpet in room was dated and had a few small stains- no big deal. Amenities were lacking- did have a little coffeemaker (worthless imo since you had to use their coffee which was bland and powdered creamer- yikes!). Bathroom- towels were soft and plentiful- but the shower was a problem. Really good pressure but tub didn't drain. It filled over my feet while I showered and didn't drain until 10 minutes after the water was turned off. I considered this not a big deal since my last stay the faucets didn't work (nothing like a late night call to maintenance). Friendly staff and concierge- I love the fact they will store your baggage for awhile even after your stay is over. How great is that! Big pool and fitness center ON SITE. Nice lobby.

This year we're back for a few extra days, and opted to try out a different hotel for the first leg. We were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel has two or three towers, with some great amenities. The outdoor pool is nice and long, and has a real 8 1/2' deep end, nice for swimmers (as opposed to too-shallow pools at some/most hotels). Right on-property is a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for some upscale dining (we went one night - very nice, our waiter was Ralph, he was great). There's a couple restaurants within walking distance, including a fish place on the pier, across the street. Our king bed room was very sizable, and it had a patio. We did not get a bay-view room, but the price for one isn't much more - so I say go for it. Still, the city-view room was still good (and we weren't in the room until night, anyhow). The bed was comfortable, and everything was clean. Very conveniently-located for tourists for sure, it's a quick walk to the ferry pier to Coronado, and the bay tour boats (which are overpriced, but it's expected). Sidebar: speaking of Coronado, if you go, get off the ferry and walk up to First St. when you get out of the little shopping area/tourist trap. Take a right on First, and walk a couple blocks to Tartine. Awesome little cafe/lunch place. It's a quick ride from the airport, and they have a free shuttle that comes to the airport every half hour. The staff was very polite, as well. Price was very, very reasonable, much less than we expected. A nice find, for people who want something nice, clean, roomy, comfortable, but not excessive. One minor complaint, for me at least, was spotty WiFi. But they have a couple of different networks and on the last day, I found one that stayed connected.

Everyone we dealt with from that first morning on was friendly and helpful. Our room had a nice view of the city with a comfortable little balcony. Yes, there was some train/trolley/city noise, but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't bother me. Also we enjoyed seeing the city lights from the balcony at night. (Note that the hotel is made up of three buildings and though it seemed all rooms had balconies, some would have \"views\" of the adjacent building or rooftop of another building. Only some had harbor views and some overlooked the downtown area. We didn't request and pay for the upgraded harbor view.) The room itself was clean, neat, and very comfortable. We could request feather pillows, which we did. The restaurant/bar was overpriced, and we soon discovered that we were within an easy walk to Little Italy and the Downtown area with many wonderful restaurants with better food and better prices. I did enjoy the little coffee stand in the lobby. The pool was clean and the lounge chairs were kept tidy and sporting a fresh towel. The shadows from the surrounding buildings kept it too chilly for my taste. We managed quite easily to do without renting a car for our 5-day stay. The hotel shuttle took us to and from the airport and to and from Balboa Park, and the trolley station was an easy walk from the hotel.

First impressions aren't great - the color of the buildings makes it look a bit cheap and cheerful. I felt more encouraged when we checked in - the lobby area is good and the staff friendly. Check in process was quick. Car parking was at the rear - and at over $20 a day it's not cheap, but it is pretty plentiful. The car park attendant was very friendly. Up to the room and, other than the view over the Bay, it was disappointing. Here's why: * billed as a double queen room but the beds were definitely not queen sized. * The bathroom. Oh boy, we hated that bathroom. First, it had a sliding door to save space. What this meant though was that there was NO privacy. The sliding door didn't stay put and so we had to put a shoe up against it to stop it from sliding back. The door also stood away from the frame about an inch. Every single noise from the bathroom was audible. If you're happy listening to bathroom noises, fine, but if you like a modicum of privacy, you, too, will hate it. * Despite them knowing there were three of us, we had a very small tablet of soap and a tiny bottle of shampoo and body lotion. No shower gel. We asked reception for more and they sent some additional supplies up, but only that first day. At the price the room was, I expected to have enough toiletries without having to take my own or buy them. * the only hair dryer was one of those nailed to the wall with the puff power of an asthmatic. With three of us queuing for the bathroom, it was frustrating that the only hair dryer was in there, along with the wardrobe (with the world's smallest supply of coathangers for three people). * The walls were thin. The very annoying guy in the room next door also had a very loud voice. At 7am, we could hear every word of his phone conversation. * The room did not have a safe. We used one for free in reception but what a pain to have to keep popping downstairs to pick things up or drop things off. As a result, we did risk security more than we would by leaving stuff in the room that we would have usually locked in a room safe. The room did have a good sized balcony, overlooking the Bay and the pool. The TV worked ok, though seemed to have limited stations.

It is not a bad hotel, but a couple of us had allergies hit us like a ton of bricks! We suspect it is either dust or a reaction to something they use to clean the rooms. Never once did I see the housekeeping staff with a vacuum so I'm betting it's dust. The hotel room was comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful whenever we needed to ask them anything. Our room was on the 6th floor and had 2 double beds, each bed had 2 firm and 2 soft pillows (with a little ribbon to identify them). There was a coffee/tea maker, TV, no fridge in the room, but a nice balcony (with a city street view). The closet is inside the bathroom - weird and a bit inconvenient. The bathroom door is a sliding door of frosted glass. Not only could you not lock it, the door left a gap on one side (awkward!) and you could see the silhouette of the person inside (even more awkward!). Bathroom amenities are Bath & Body Works Coconut & Verbena scented. The blow-dryer was one of the wall mounted gizmo's that no matter how long you use it your hair never gets dry. As someone else mentioned, if you sit on the toilet seat cover, it buckles and bows from y our weight. The bathroom lighting was a bit dim - I ended up doing my makeup sitting on the bed with natural light from the balcony window. The shower stall is spacious, but had weird drainage issues. Inevitably I'd be standing in a soapy puddle 3\" deep after taking a 10 minute shower and I always felt bad for whoever had to use it next. Even after the maid cleaned the room there would still be some water in the shower. Other than the mysterious allergies likely brought on by dust, the room was clean. Not to be stereotypical or rude - but the maid only spoke and understood Spanish. Um... really? I thought that was a sitcom joke, but I guess not. There is a nice outdoor pool in the atrium of the hotel but the weather was too cool for us to use it. The elevators don't require you to swipe a key, which makes me nervous because anyone could just waltz right in off the street. Our room's door never closed very well on it's own - we either had to push it shut or pull it closed when we were leaving. The free Wi-Fi was atrociously slow!

To head to the convention center & Gaslamp district the America Place stop is just across the street from the Santa Fe depot. Would I stay here again? Hopefully not (hear that Travel Planners?!!).

Another plus is that the hotel is also very close to a lot of attractions (Seaport Village, USS Midway, historic ships, Coronado Ferry, Gaslamp district) that we were able to walk to. I also liked being able to run along the bay in the morning. We liked the hotel's shuttle service to/from airport and the zoo, but wished they would add another drop off and pick up time for attractions in mid-afternoon. We took the 9 a.m. shuttle to the zoo. Next shuttle pick up was 11:20 which would have been too soon. The shuttle pick up after that one was 4:20. We were done before that and ended up taking a taxi back to the hotel which cost us $13. Breakfast is not provided and I think for the price, they could offer something complimentary to guests. I don't understand how similar hotels in that price range (Residence Inn by Marriott and Holiday Inn Express) offer free breakfasts but the Holiday Inn doesn't. We ate one morning at the Elephant and Castle. Breakfast for 2 was $30. Other mornings I ended up walking to Ralph's Grocery Store on G Street and bought yogurts, milk and fruit. They also had some hot breakfast sandwiches. At a $1.99 my son really enjoyed the croissant egg and cheese sandwich. It ended up being a lot cheaper than eating out every morning. The room itself was decent size. I agree with the others who said it seemed a little odd to have the closet in the bathroom. The frosted sliding glass was also a little different.

We stayed in the South Tower, and had a city view which could be a little loud at times because it is near the train station, but hey it was San Diego you shouldnt be sleeping all day anyways! The restaurant and deli at the hotel were very good and had reasonable prices. You are right across the street from the bay where it is just a short walk to many restaurants and shops. Also across the street is a Ferry that will take you to Coronado Island (but it is really not an island) where you can walk to coronado beach or enjoy the shops and restaurants they have there. The free shuttle was on time from the airport and too as well as the zoo. You are in short walking distance about 1 mile to the Gaslamp Quarters, Baseball Stadium, Hortan Plaza and a little shorter walk to Seaport Village. If you are not a walker there are plenty of ways to get around if you dont rent a car. There are pedi cabs that will take you most places and you just tip them. My stay here was excellent and I did not want to leave. I would stay at this hotel again 100%. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel there are plenty in San Diego go to one. If you are looking for a clean and friendly hotel that is reasonably priced then this is the place to stay! I wish I could go back right now!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel...nothing special\u201d", "Author": "jahlygirl", "ReviewID": "UR67072195", "Content": "I stayed here for about a week while on a business trip.

Inititally, they had me staying in the north tower, but when I got to the room and realized by balcony was right next to a parking garage, I asked to be moved becuase I didn't feel safe. They moved me to a room in the South Tower. It seems as though the South Tower (the tower were the front desk is located) is more updated than the north tower. The bathroom looked like it had been redone recently. It was modern and clean...but the room was just average. The gym leaves MUCH to be desired. The only equipment were a few nautilus machines and 1 bike, all of which looked like they were bought at a yard sale in the early 1980s. But, I guess most people just go running along the marina. The pool is small. There are also weird smells that come out of the elevator bank (I'm guesing the kitchen was right below). The hotel is about a 25-30 minute walk to the Gaslamp district/ Convention Center, or a $7-8 cab ride. The onsite restaurent isn't that great, but at least there's a Ruth's Chris right next door.

Arriving two days early, you might say that this was every bit as much a leisure trip as much as business. We highly recommend this hotel. The Hotel In spite of being of an older vintage, we found the hotel to be stylish and comfortable. The public and guest rooms have been recently updated. The hotel is of an earlier vintage, but in some ways this is good. Most of the rooms have a full sized balconies with plenty of room for two chairs and a table. The View The view of the bay is worth the extra charge. The view here may even be better than those further down the bay like the Marriot, Hilton, or Hyatt. Being located further north along the bay, you get a really clear view of the large open expanse that is north San Diego Bay. The bay view rooms have a clear view of the cruise ships, the Maritime Museum, the Midway Museum, the airport, Presido Park and Point Loma in the distance. Did I mention the entire north end of the embarcadero? We had considered the Best Western Bayside, but it is simply not bayside. Only the Holiday Inn on the Bay is - in this neighborhood. The Noise Many travelers have noted the noise level in this hotel. We found that the plane take-offs taper dramatically during the night hours. This noise is greatly diminished by simply closing the glass sliding door. We had two cruise ship departures which were during the day hours, and a source of excitement being a frequent cruiser. Having a Bay view room, I did not find the noise to be a real problem. Being in a lovely corner smoking room on the 10th floor, we could here the bells and clangs of approaching trains on the outside deck, but not at all with the door closed. The Service and Facilities We found the service to be very good overall. All the employees we encountered were actually very friendly and helpful. The housekeeping was excellent, and the bed was very comfortable. If you are going to take advantage of the room service, I recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best 4 Value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast which includes a full breakfast for $9.95. More often, we used the coffee stand at the elevators in the north tower which had excellent coffee, pastries and the ability to charge to your room. Hazelwoods in the south tower will also charge any meal to your room. Breakfast and lunch are there stronger suits. The Elephant and Castle Pub in the main lobby is a lovely place with an immaculately groomed patio area and decent food. The pool was nice and warm and big enough for my taste. They have not one, but two fitness centers. The convenient on-site parking is what it is at $22 per day, but they will include it as a room charge if so desired. The Location I loved the location, but it will not be to everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste. Easy walk to Little Italy, Maritime Museum, Harbor Cruise and Coronado Ferry. Great dinner locations within walking distance at Indigo Grill, Fish Market, Burger Lounge, Buon Appetito, or Fillipi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It about one mile north of the Convention Center, but the walk is lovely along the embarcadero. The trolleys at American Plaza will get you to the Convention Center more quickly, but still involve about a half mile walk.

The main building rooms are clearly some of the last to be updated as mine had noticeably dated and scratched fixtures, ancient TV, carpet & furniture.

As many other people mentioned it has a great location and you can walk to everything including the trolly/metro which is great if you want to avoid the pricey cabs. We had an easy walk to seaport village and a nice mall downtown, as well as many different places to eat.

The beds were pretty comfortable. The free wireless was great. Other than that it is very very no frills. My biggest complaints are the customer service and the noise. At about 9:00 every night we could hear a lot of banging and dragging of furniture from somewhere near us. It was definately not guest noise...it sounded like renovations or something the hotel was doing. It started promply at 9 every night and ended around 10:30 or 11. It was very loud and annoying, so I called one night. They played dumb and said they had no knowledge of anything going on that would cause such loud noises. Basically they had a very we-don't-care attitude. Also you will hear lots of beeping and honking and car alarms, as well as typical port noises, so just be aware that this hotel is in NOT in a quiet area. I know many of these noises cannot be helped, but slamming furniture around? I asked other people at my conference and they heard it too. Very strange. Another thing that sealed the deal for me and made me decide I would not come back is when I came down to the front desk to ask a quick question. I noticed one of the concierge workers was being very short and rude to the people in front of me. I waited patiently in line, and when it came my turn, they guy stared down at his computer and ignored me for at least 10 minutes. Finally someone else came over to ask if I had been helped.

The hotel did a pick up on graduation day, but the driver didn't know what time to show, was late, and would not let everyone on the bus even though it was half empty. Another service they offered was laundry. Well, the washers were broken, so no laundry. Our toilet backed up twice, once prompting a 12:15 AM maintenance call.

This made the floor very slippery, so we spent a lot of time mopping. Also, there was a fan in the bathroom, but it did not work at all. Customer service? Forget about it. The did not care at all. Any time we brought up any of these issues, they thought we were trying to get a free upgrade so they did not care. On a positive note, the rooms were clean with fresh towels and beds made every day.

It may not be a 4 star but it was clean, comfortable and the staff was very friendly. I will note that others reviewed the opaque bathroom sliding door and yes they are that way and very not \"private\" but we thought it was funny. There's a small balcony at least if you need some \"fresh air\" ;-) The Elephant & Castle Pub has amazing food and awesome bloody mary's ;-) They are a bit pricey but we never did try the cafe a few doors down because we liked the food at the pub so much. It was reasonable I think for a typical meal in San Diego anyway! The hotel shuttle is right at the airport waiting for you and is only about 5-10 minutes away if not. They shuttle you to the San Diego zoo, Horton Plaza, SeaPort Village, etc. They even shuttled us to SeaWorld one day for less than a cab would have charged so that was very convenient. Like I said most stuff is w/in walking distance anyway. San Diego in general is great we go frequently and always have fun. I recommend staying in downtown just because it's so convenient. **TIP: One downfall of the Holiday Inn is they charge $22 a night per parking which is insane. But we had a rental car and never paid the parking fee because even in July there was always a meter available right out front which was free from I think midnight to 8am so factor in simply the cost for the meter after 8am and we got a good deal. Save your money and either park at a meter or go to the 5 star lot right around the block. We didn't use the pool or the gym (didn't need to with all the walking) but they looked really nice and clean. Some reviewers mentioned noise from the trains. It is (a ways) behind the hotel but never bothered us at all. We stayed in the front hotel so maybe that makes a difference. The only noise that bothered me was the horn from the cruise ships but that's only because it seemed to always go off right as I walked by and scare the he!! out of me! SeaPort was awesome. The gardens down there are perfect for a wedding and there are even horse-drawn carriage rides through the park. There are lots of waterfront restaurants, good wines and food, and about 50 some specialty shops with lots of neat things.

The room: They try for little touches like 2 firm and 2 soft pillows but those details are lost on a room thaty needs updating. I felt very priceline in that I could put over another building in a room that looked like it was part of a multi-room suite ( doors on both sides?) The bathroom on the other had is remodeled BUT it only has a SHOWER...which sorta sucks if you are a hairy girl who needs to save (not to management other hotels with only showers I have been too have little wood benches which make shaving/relaxing EASY)....The chair in the room is probably older then me!!! The room was a bit smoky but I didn't understand why until I realized that this 1960's hotel has balconies which I thought would be nice..Once again if I had had a view it would of been nicer..Each balcony has two chairs and it was fun to check out the nearby new lofts. If you are a exhibitionist or voyeur...you will enjoy, I was actually pleased for a second UNTIL I saw the sign that you should close your window for \"safety reasons'....and I realized that all the balconies were attached (ie if you are a crazy robber/rapist you could walk ONTO my balcony and INTO ROOM if I kept my window door open..This sorta ruined my plan to sleep with the window open and let the sea air wake me up...as I had a vision of possible previous crimes... Would i go back...umm I think I would pass for another option. IMPORTANT NOTE: I sleep like a log but for lite sleeps this hotel is next to a tram/rail station. At 3am there were red lights and lonts of dinging...didn't phase me but should be noted.. For kids the balcony would be a huge safety issue...", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnpeg, MB", "Title": "\u201cSo- so.....high 2 star, low 3 if at all.\u201d", "Author": "bartondarr", "ReviewID": "UR34689615", "Content": "What can one expect from an older Holiday Inn, but an older one and it shows.

We got an Ocean View King room, so by mid afternoon room temp was hot, needed the drapes closed all the way, with AC on otherwise it was stifling hot by supper time. And the road noise is terrible, since the cruise ship dock is right across the street pretty much. Also, lots of regular road traffic including heavy trucks. You want quiet, best to take the cityscape view instead. Room is okay, bed was squeaky springs on one side, but somewhat comfortable. If you want a basic hotel its fine, but if you want a more luxury, go elsewhere. Location is great though, walking distance to lots of attractions, shopping, waterfront, restaurants, etc. One can even take a ride on a bike cart taxi service, cute at first but they become a real pain after a while approaching you for business. They use a right in your face approach, and after 50 times being asked it got very annoying. Room service expensive, add on an 18% service fee, plus delivery charge. Make sure you go see the USS Midway floating museum, the Maritime Museum, and take the 2 hour tour around the harbor, well worth the money!

Moreover, the hotel is within walking distance to some great things to do. The Midway aircraft carrier, Seaport Village, the old sailing ships, not too far from the Gaslamp Quarter. And, you're only a few miles from Old Town. Now for the bad. I'm no snob, but this hotel needs some serious updating. We rec'd a room on the second floor, right next to the elevator and ice machine. Needless to say, some in our family didn't get a very good night's sleep. There was a bunch of young kids across the hall partying it up into the wee hours, yelling and carrying on. Did the hotel staff just not care? The two beds in our room were small. I thought it would be two queens but it was more like two fulls or doubles. The room itself was very small. I also have little doubt that we rec'd such a poor location due to the fact that we booked on priceline. I've heard that this is common. Finally, be prepared to pay $22 to park your car. That's right! $22!! Amazing. This is somewhat common in this part of San Diego as you're basically in the city. But, given that I only paid $64 for the room, what can you expect?

Great suggestion and I'd go one further by recommending 15th floor so no noise above you. We only noticed it a couple of times and our room air/heat/fan ran all the time and never heard planes, trains, or whistles at night. Just marvelous! All rooms have a balcony. What fun watching the cruise ships ( no more than 2 at a time) come and go. We could walk across the street and on the boardwalk down to the U.S.S. Midway, ate at The Fish Market next door to Midway ship. Food just ok, nice ambience. Walking the other direction, we were directly across the street from Anthony's, which offered outside eating, main dining room dinner fare, or lunch fare in another section. Our food was good and fairly inexpensive. Great martinis and the cheapest on our trip. Walking this direction took us past the Maritime Museum and we stopped at the marina as hubby ran out of steam. We took the Gray Line Tour and wished we'd taken the San Diego Trolley Tour, as we would have spent more time at the Conronado Hotel and seen more of the area but was advised if walking an issue, take the Gray Line tour. More stops on the Trolley and you don't have to get on and off each time so it is the better bargain. It goes the same places as Gray Line but for less and you get to pick your stops if you want off and wait for next one. Our tour was 1/2 day but doing the trolley, I'm sure would take one entire day. Our room was on the smaller size, but very well equipped, clean and comfortable. Do wish they'd offered free internet use at their one business station, but we did have a five minute use for printing out flight boarding passes. Also, do think our trip would have started smoother if the desk clerk had of been more helpful. We arrived at 1:30PM from the airport and were told check-in was not till 3:00. It was hot and I asked if there was any place we could change into swim suits and I got a blank look and was told where we could leave our suitcases. Most everyone else was so helpful.

We tried the Italian restaurant on Ash that was recommended by another Trip Advisor for breakfast, an excellent menu but Canadian bacon was too thin and too overdone and hubby not overly fond of his baked pancake but I loved my french toast with fruit compote, It was also pricey. Hazelwood Cafe is part of the Holiday Inn and breakfast there was fine and the cheapest place around to eat.

We schlepped with our bags to our car and the attendent of that lot said our daily parking fee to the hotel wouldn't work for his lot. Eventually he let us leave without paying, but it was a bit of a hassle. He seemed like a nice guy, actually, and I don't think was trying to scam us.

Holiday Inn's pillow menu is definitely a huge plus - no more flat pillows!! Housekeeping took about 15 minutes to bring us our pillows, pretty fair timing if you ask me.

It wasn't much and easily rinsed away, so we overlooked it, considering the rest of our room was immaculate. The mint amenities were refreshing and of decent quality Our balcony was rather small (we were in the north tower) - you could barely fit two people standing on it - but it was definitely better than not having one! The restaurant has good food, but seems to be poorly managed and understaffed. The poor hostess was so overwhelmed I thought she was going to cry! We ordered the food to go and enjoyed a sunset dinner from our hotel room - it added a very nice touch to our experience! Just outside and to the right of the hotel entrance (when you're looking at the hotel), there's a little deli on the property - you can get excellent salads, among other deli items and they have the best cobb salad I've ever had.

I had read the previous reviews so had an idea that certain sides/towers were to be avoided, and thought I had paid extra for a bay view. We ended up with a room directly over the entrance canopy, next to the lifts, and the bay was indeed visible through the flags and buses pulling up - just. When I asked if there was a room higher up, I was met with the indifference mentioned so often in these reviews - in short, no way. We then went across the road for dinner in a fish restaurant which was hugely popular (although we couldn't for the life of us see why). However, somewhat jet lagged after our 11 hour flight, we left and headed for bed. Now, I would have thought we could have slept through most things that night, but this place IS REALLY NOISY. There was some horrendous and regular booming noise which at first sounded like a ship's fog horn, but after repeated opportunities to guess the source, sounded more like some kind of electric pump coming from inside the hotel. Add to this the lift noise, the outside noise from people arriving, airplanes, women screaming in delight at meeting each other in the coridor at 1.00pm and general air conditioning, toilet flushing, ... OK, you get the picture. Breakfast was a very strange affair in a mock British pub. For those of you familiar with the real thing, you will know they are not conducive to 'in the cold light of day' breakfasting. In fact, most British pubs should be avoided until well after mid-day, and preferebaly visited only in subdued lighting. The ambiance and decor was matched by the food. We became very British indeed (after all, it purported to be a British establishment) and exclaimed loudly when told they had no ordinary tea. Thistle, raspberry, dahlia cuttings, but no real tea. Fortunately, I recalled we had been left 2 tea bags by the coffee pot in the room (??) so I retrieved those and eeked them out in war-time fashion. The only good thing I have to say about this hotel is after breakfast, we were able to wheel our cases across the road and walk straight on to the ship, which we had seen arriving earlier. That part at least was very convenient. Though why on earth anyone would stay here who wasn't going on a cruise is beyond me. On our way home, we were delayed due to the late arrival of the ship. We missed our flights and had to stay a further night in San Diego. Needless to say we avoided the Holiday Inn like the plague. We ended up staying at the Sheraton ,closer to the airport. Other people in the same situation stayed at the Embassy Suites, Days Inn, etc - all equally convenient although perhaps a little more money in some cases, but worth the short taxi ride to the cruise pier and ten times nicer than this hotel.

It's especially great if you're a boat-watcher and like to see all kinds of ships (military and civilian). 4. The staff was VERY friendly. 5. The room service breakfast was excellent. Now the negatives: 1. At about 3 AM, a train comes by the hotel and blows its horn and it sounds like it's right outside your window. We were on the opposite side of the tower away from the train and it still woke me up. 2. The building is NOISY. It's old, so the walls must not have been built with the latest soundproofing, so you can hear EVERY noise that's going on around you, especially at 3 AM when the train wakes you up and you're having a hard time falling back asleep. 3. The bed was HARD AS A ROCK. My back actually hurt after sleeping on it. The price, location, staff and view made this hotel nice, but the hard bed and bad soundproofing really detracted from the experience.

The bed was very comfortable. We reserved a room with a bay view and this is what we received. It was clean, comfortable, the staff was pleasant, and the location is great. Both the cafe and restaurant offer casual dining with patio seating. Kids of guests eat free. If you're planning to simply visit the downtown area, it's a twenty minute walk along the boardwalk to Seaport Village. The Coronado Ferry departs every twenty minutes or so right across from the hotel (nominal fee). You can also catch the trolley ($5/day kids under 6 free) or bus (sdcommute.com) within 3 blocks and make your way to the zoo or Seaworld, Mission Beach, as an example. We rented a deuce coupe(2 seater low rider where two small children can sit off the back side) from Wheels of Fun located within the same property. Don't bother renting a car unless you plan to venture beyond Mission Beach. You'll only end up paying for gas and parking. Check in with any housekeeping needs before 6pm. Airport shuttle included.

It is in the same general area as downtown/the convention center, but separated from it by an ocean of cruise-ship parking and so a bit less expensive. I found that the trolley wasn't convenient for the distance I had to go, and ended up just walking the mile to the convention center each day. This hotel charges business-class prices, but it doesn't have some features that I would expect from a business-class hotel, such as HBO, a refrigerator/microwave/coffeemaker, or included breakfast. There is also a very unreasonable charge for parking ($18/day for guests, just $2 less than the rate for the general public). The trains didn't bother me (I actually found the noise comforting) but I was disapointed that I paid so much for a room with a view of the parking lot. What did bother me was the noise from other rooms. The walls must be quite thin. The \"English\" pub downstairs is overpriced and mediocre, and I found the housekeeping service indifferent. I am all in favor of the effort to save water by not changing towels every day, but when I left the sign on the bed asking to have the sheets changed (because they had gotten sandy from a trip to the beach the day before), housekeeping must have ignored my request because the next night they were still sandy. It's not the worst accommodation in the world--it's a fine basic room, with no holes in the walls or obvious dirt--but I think there are better options for the price. The only situation in which I might recommend this hotel is an overnight stay before or after leaving on a cruise.", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontlliw, Wales", "Title": "\u201cLocation good, everything else bad!\u201d", "Author": "Brillo51", "ReviewID": "UR5593957", "Content": "I am normally very satisfied with Holiday Inns but this is an exception!

We arrived on a Friday night and the Hotel was completely booked for the weekend. We had requested a bayview room in the north tower when we made the reservation. Having stayed there 3 years ago we knew that the higher you are on the north tower the better the view. However, since they were booked for the weekend they told us to check again on Sunday morning. In the meantime, we had a south tower room on the 5th floor. It wasn't bad but the bayview was not as great. The hotel has complimentary wireless internet connection which worked great for us. On Sunday we were able to move to room 1463 in the north tower which had spectacular views of the bay. It was a corner room and more updated than the first one we had but it was smaller. We experienced great service from the front desk and our housekeeping maid. Our only complaint was the room service. We had to call twice to get softer pillows and twice to get more hangers never received the hangers. The noise from the airport did not bother us but we are used to living near the airport so I can see how this might bother some people. You must reserve a bayview if you want to avoid the train noise since the cityview rooms all face the train station. We recommend the following places for meals: Elephant & Castle if you want waiter service but the best bet for breakfast in my opinion is Hazelwoods Deli right underneath the south tower and next to Ruth Chris'. They serve breakfast from 6 to 11 a.m. and it's very affordable especially for large families. We had dinner several times at Anthony's Fishette and once at Anthony's Fish Grotto right across the street. We also recommend Old Town Mexican Cafe. They have the best Margaritas and good food.

The bathroom was tiny, one of the lights in the bathroom did not work so it was dark and the toilet was blocked.The room smelled of cigarettes and was in deperate need of re-decoration. However the best bit was still to come -- the back of the hotel backs onto the Railway, and a crossing, so every night and during the night you get woken up with the warning bells of the crossing and then the blaring warning horns of the Amtrack train -- what a joke expecting people to sleep through this. The front of the hotel may have beautiful views but the people allocated to the back are treated like second class citizens. The 'British' style pub at the entrance is tacky and over done.

As some of the reviews indicate, the hotel rooms are pretty basic and could do with a bit of an update -- but overall, the stay was great. We checked in on Thursday night before the Memorial Day Weekend -- and it didn't start out great -- they couldn't find our reservation. I'm a Priority Club Member (Holiday Inn rewards program) -- so thankfully, they were able to pull my reservation from their cancelled reservations (somehow, when I called to confirm, their new reservation department thought I was cancelling). No problem -- they checked us in and actually gave us an upgrade (sign up for the reward program -- I received a bayview room on the 10th Floor of the tower [connected to the lobby] for $145 night.) Every single person that worked at the hotel from the front desk folks to the valet parking attendants to the cleaning crew at the pool were friendly and helpful. The parking cost is $18/day for self-park or $22/day for valet parking. All with in/out service. We did have an issue with our drain in the shower (didn't work properly) -- fixed promptly, and an issue with our front door -- you had to pull really hard to make it shut. I met others at the hotel who were complaining about their room locks as well -- so just be careful and double check that it's locked when you leave. There is a restaurant in the hotel lobby -- the Elephant and Castle -- very good food, reasonable prices and fast. The kids loved that they could play pool in the bar area until 9:00pm. There is also a well-stocked gift shop that is open from 6:00am until 11:00pm each day. The location of the hotel is ideal. You are right on the harbor -- with easy access to I-5 and downtown via city streets. The view is spectacular and although you can notice the noise if you're sitting on the balcony (yes, the planes and trains do make noise pretty regularly) I didn't notice too much interruption during the night (plus the hotel provides ear plugs, if you're inclined.) Also, one strange thing was that the balconies of the hotel are interrconnected -- hard to explain, except that there is no real divider between them and what does divide them could be easily climbed over, so you need to be conscious of this and not leave your balcony door unlocked and also make sure you are dressed appropriately if you go out on the balcony and don't want to be surprised by your neighbor sitting two feet away with a very small fence separating you. The pool was heated, although not enough for me! The kids loved it. It was clean and plenty of towels. Mainly populated with business folks. Also, there is free internet service throughout the hotel, and a computer with a printer in the lobby for $5.95/15 minutes. Although we had a rental car, there was numerous shuttles to the airport, zoo, Horton Plaza and the Seaport Village -- we didn't use them, but the shuttles were always around and others seemed to be using them. Also an exercise room that was open the same hours as the gift shop. We would definitely return to the Holiday Inn on the Bay -- I had no complaints and you couldn't ask for a better location.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, MN", "Title": "\u201cToo many trains - Need to soundproof\u201d", "Author": "GurlieGirl", "ReviewID": "UR5029251", "Content": "The front desk person was very helpful suggesting places to eat in the area and giving information on the shuttle service provided by the hotel.

You get everything from the slight ringing of the light rail all way to the very long, very loud blast from the freight train at 3:30 AM. They need to do something in this hotel about soundproofing.

I also had the opportunity to take the ferry over to Coronado, then the shuttle bus to the hotel.

South Tower, 5th. floor bay view with balcony afforded a magnificent view, day and night. Breakfast in the hotel Elephant & Castle Pub is outstanding...omlets and potatoes, french toast...best I'm ever eaten. Easy walking to tour posts, the ship Midway, and sailer Star of India. Near airport and easy access to all major attactions. Parking was $18 per day but for the convenience of location, location, I'd pay it again.

Yes, it is true that light rail and Amtrak both run about a block away from the hotel and during the day will hear them, but that was part of what was great about this location. San Diego has a very nice, vibrant downtown area. Gaslamp, Horton Plaza and Seaport Village are all within a mile of the hotel. The cruise ship terminal, the Midway Aircraft Carrier, historic ships port museum, cruise ship terminal and San Diego Bay Tour ships are all within walking distance. Let's talk about the service. I was treated great by everyone from the valets, front desk, housekeeping, ectt.. I arrived having car troubles. The concierge desk went over and beyond to try to solve my problem. The restaurant offered free meals to my young children and never treated me differently even though I was the only paying adult with three kids gettting free meals. The front desk treated me no differently even though I booked a discounted room on the internet. They even gave me a nicer room than I asked for with a great city view. If I have a negative about the hotel, it would probably be the plain and undersized pool and no hot tub. The parking charge of $18/day is obscene, although there is a large parking lot directly north of the hotel that only charges $5 a day on the weekend. This is a very nice hotel and is worth the $150 the hotel's website wants for it, but is a steal if you can get it for less than $100 a night on Priceline or Hotwire.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poway (San Diego) CA", "Title": "\u201cSan Diego Local review\u201d", "Author": "cm1000", "ReviewID": "UR3628757", "Content": "My husband and I were able to get away from the kids for one night to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary (thanks gma and gpa!). Being a busy holiday weekend, we decided to visit our own San Diego backyard. I am a native. I have always seen this hotel, but never stayed here. We checked in on Thursday, and were given a room on the 7th floor. I mentioned our anniversary, and next thing I knew, we were given a room on the TOP floor (14th) in the main tower over looking the bay - we had the corner room. Big thanks to the Hotel Regisrar! About 10 minutes after check in, the hotel sent us a complimentary bottle of sparkeling wine (Cal version of champagne). The view was AMAZING - we sat on the balcony, sipping our wine and watched the boats and ships sail across the bay, the planes land and take off at Lindburgh Field (San Diego Int'l Airport), and people walking along the boardwalk. The Star of India is right across the street, next to one of our favorite restaurants, Anthony's, where we ate dinner later that night. We did not use the pool, the parking is $18 per night, which may seem steep, but you have in and out priveledges. You can walk to 7-11, many restaurants (Jack in the Box, Anthony's, Little Italy) -there are numerous pedicabs to take you anywhere in Downtown - most of the pedicabbers work just on tips and will give you a great tour. We had a great time. The street traffic and airport add some \"noise\" but it is a white noise that didn't bother us at all. The view was worth the bayside price increase. Try to get above the 9th floor. Our room was CLEAN and had very new furnishings, carpet, curtains. We are already talking about our next visit. There was no noise coming from the other guest rooms (just the normal comings and goings). If you want peace and quiet, go camping. If you like walking and running along the boardwalk of the bay, eating seafood, visiting San Diego's great Maritime museums, and being close to many San Diego activities, this was a great place to stay.", "Date": "July 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your time!\u201d", "Author": "surfmama3", "ReviewID": "UR3429081", "Content": "The Holiday Inn on the Bay, was very disappointing.

The front desk could have been friendlier but the customer service women was nice. The room was small and simple. I will say that making guests pay $18 for parking is ridiculous, especially when all the parking lots around the city that we saw were less than that.

This is one of my two favorite hotels in San Diego, because of the great location. And if you get an odd-numbered room in the Tower, the view is SIMPLY SPECTACULAR. Other than that it's just a normal, ho-hum hotel; nice, clean, nothing too fancy but truly nice enough. The room service has odd hours but because there are so many great restauarants in walking distance, it's no big deal. Especially try the restaurant \"The Fish Market\", about a 3-block stroll south on Harbor Dr. Also, in Little Italy, try both Filippi's (great food cheap) and Indigo Grill (great food with modern twists, not real cheap, but an appetizer is a meal). The other great hotel is the Radisson in La Jolla, which has beautiful grounds. It's far away from the main part of San Diego but near UCSD, La Jolla, La Jolla Beaches, etc. Be sure to try the La Valencia hotel's Sunday brunch but most important, get reservations (and directions) to the well-hidden (and a bit hard to find) but amazing Marine Room. Great ambiance and food (if a trifle pricey), it has a small jazz band for dancing but it is RIGHT ON THE OCEAN. The waves literally lap at it. Just go for a sunset drink and appetizer instead of splurging on a full dinner: you will be SO GLAD YOU DID. It's adjacent to the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. Anyway, depending on what you're looking for (spectacular view and good location are top in my book), I disagree that there are nicer hotels to be had for the money, if you get any kind of break at all on the room rate.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cottage Grove, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "JosieCat-MN", "ReviewID": "UR3274316", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay at the Holiday Inn on the Bay.

I have traveled a lot and have stayed in Super 8's, Motel 6's and other hole in the wall motels. I was on vacation with a friend and took the airport shuttle to Super 8 (fyi, the shuttle is GREAT). I had paid and reserved the room online, so I ran to the front desk, checked in and got my key(s). Our room was on the 2nd floor, basically in the middle. Upon arrival to the room, I placed my bag down and unpacked my things into the drawers and hung up pants, etc. I then ran to the bathroom. The tub was filthy with hair and soap scum, and the toilet had not been cleaned. There was used and nasty toilet paper stuck in the seat. I then left the bathroom and looked at my sheets which were stained with blood or something. I called the front desk and asked if they could have someone come up and clean the room. They said they would, and offered a different room. I declined because I had already unpacked and told them I'd rather just have the room cleaned and be confident that it had been done. I waited over 45 min for someone. I called the front desk again and asked if I could just clean my own room and use their supplies. The woman told me that they couldn't let me do that and that someone would be up shortly. 25 minutes later a woman did show up and asked me what the problem was. I walked her through the room and showed her the filth all over the place. I asked for new sheets. She then handed me the cleaning products. I told her that the woman downstairs told me I could not use them. She said it was fine, so I set forth cleaning the entire room and changing my sheets. From then on, the staff treated my friend and I poorly and when I attempted to speak to the manager about all of this, he shrugged it off like it was nothing. I gave him a speech on customer service and that if someone is paying for certain services, they should be done. And that it was pathetic that I ended up having to clean my own room because of the lack of customer service there was. We stayed for seven days. Our third night in, the guests in the room next to ours were making all kinds of noise ALL NIGHT. I called front desk and told them. Nothing happened. The next night the same guests ended up having the police come to their room and two people got arrested. The remainder of the nights, we had many guests go through that room next to ours, all of them loud and obnoxious. Not surprising as this hotel is in the GHETTO. The K-Mart in the adjoining parking lot had a shooting two nights before we arrived in AZ which I had seen on the news while there. The staff was not even knowledgeable about things to do in the area. I have been to Phoenix many times and was looking to try something new. They just pointed me to the brochure stand. My car rental woman was more helpful than the hotel staff, and she didn't even live in the area! Their claim to have great WIFI was a scam. My friend who was with me is a computer tech nerd and experienced issues on a regular basis even finding a connection. One good thing was the pool. It was kept clean and everything. The chairs were broken and old, but other than that, there was a clean pool and hot tub. Overall, while it was a place to sleep, there are much better options than putting yourself in this type of situation. I usually just keep my mouth shut and go with the flow, as I understand all of us have our bad days and sometimes things just aren't the way we'd like them, but the staff, service, and services at this motel were atrocious.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Super-8!\u201d", "Author": "sapphire_tyger", "ReviewID": "UR58331695", "Content": "I would like to preface this by saying, whenever I travel, if there is a Super-8 conveniently located, I stay there. I so far have not had a bad Super-8 experience. This one is no exception. Located right off I-17, easy to find and get to. The front desk staff was friendly, helpful, and very cool. Even when I inadvertently ended up thinking the Motel 6 next door was also their building and went to the wrong room, they laughed it off and were very nice about it when I came back and complained, and they had to explain my mistake. The room smelled wonderful and was spotless! A huge plus with me! Plenty of clean towels, soap, shampoo, coffee for the coffeemaker supplied. Easy access to the WiFi connection. When I returned to my room the following day, the room had been cleaned but none of my things were out of order. The Kmart within walking distance is a bonus, for those \"oops\" things that travelers tend to forget, as well. My only complaint would be the continental breakfast - some coffee, a pitcher of apple juice, a toaster and loaf of bread, two kinds of cereal and a jug of milk. Lucky for me I was not counting on the breakfast, as the conference I was attending down the street had a wonderful spread. Check-out was a breeze and again, the front desk staff was very friendly.

They weren't running around and dancing, simply walking around the room like normal and we would hear every single step and creakiness. It was loud enough to disturb us whilst watching tv and easily woke us up in the middle of the night due to someone up there walking late night to the bathroom. The room itself was basically your average Super8 except the bathroom and sink had very nasty mold build-up in the corners. The hot tub and pool were awesome and heated I believe. The downside though is that the continental breakfast is cramped into the corner of the lobby and the 2 tables they had pretty much added to the crampedness so we had to wait in line for about 5 minutes while all of 3 people in front of us got food. When we got to the food (at 8:15 am, their breakfast bar ended at 9 am) they were out of juice and bread and at one point milk (but luckily they brought out a new one eventually) and the high-point was the individual packages of 'HoneyBuns' they had (instead of muffins). All I have to say is it really looks bad when you advertise a breakfast and then run out of food/juice. I mean seriously, us 'Super8er's' mostly go to Super8's because they're low-cost and promise breakfasts and if you can't provide a decent breakfast then I have to go to the next alternative (ie fast food) which will 'eat up' any cost savings I get from staying at Super8 and so if you force me to spend on breakfast I might as well have stayed at the next rung up of hotels which offers a free breakfast. I might stay here again however there's no way I'd stay on the first floor again (because I like sleep) and I would probably have to get up much earlier than normal (at like 6 am) just so I could actually have juice and more of a breakfast because some manager doesn't know how to forecast how much juice/bread/milk to buy. Overall though, the hotel supply in Phoenix is so elastic and the prices so similar that I will probably try out a Super8 competitor with the same offering and same price just so I don't have to take a chance with this Super8.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cFine, but DON'T reserve online\u201d", "Author": "deelightfull", "ReviewID": "UR51859748", "Content": "I stayed at this room using reward points, so it was free to me.

The food at the outside bar is basic and decent. Nothing gourmet just pizza, burgers, wings and other stuff. The prices were also reasonable. There are alot of places to eat in the area also. If you want a cheap place to stay where you can have fun with the kids then I recommend this hotel. I like the fact that the pool and water park are both gated so when your 2 year old takes off running you don't have to worrry about him escaping the area....LOL. Disney is 14 miles away so this is a great place to stay if you want to visit the parks too. We stayed at the Animal kingdom one night and the pool was soooo far from our room.

She put us on the first floor which has tile floors, perfect for our family. It is NOT the Hilton but I am not paying Hilton prices either.

We have two rooms which have worked out wondefully for us to have the kids in one room(adjoining) and our own private room since we are staying for 8 nights. The rooms are serviced very nice every day with everything we need, everything works well. I called to extend our stay 2 nights and Angela was very kind to give us the same rate we paid on an \"advance purchase special\" for the next 2 nights. I have to say I was hesitant to stay here when I saw the reviews regarding bugs and dirty sheets, since I am a VERY particular person, but there have been no site of any bugs at all in our room the entire week and the sheets have been clean. The other OCD items people posted seem really lame to me. The resort fee is $15/day, thats posted on the site, we knew about that, at the rate we got for the room the $15 is no big deal. As far as people complaining about the beds and no kleenex, they need to REALLY get a life! This was our first vacation in a very long time and it was great for our family. The kids love the waterpark although I have to say I laugh every day when I see the life guards at the waterpark with their safety floats since the water never gets over 2 ft deep and there are no lifeguards at the pool which is over 8 ft deep. Of course, at a hotel I don't expect a life guard at all so it serves as a point of humor rather then bothersome. This hotel is a little older and some of the rooms were renovated 3 or 4 years ago so be sure and ask for one of those.

Adjacent hotels are abandoned with temporary chain link fence surrounding buildings that are missing doors, windows and air conditioners. The homeless people do not seem to mind, however. Homeless people were seen bathing and doing laundry in the ponds on this Clarion property. Vacant buildings and closed businesses abound. Both pizza restaurants listed in the hotel's information binder are out of business. The overall appearance of Clarion was bad. Walls are dirty with lots of marks; concrete walkways badly pitted; vending machines dirty and out of product all week. The room was worse - carpet and furniture stained and not just a little bit but a lot stained. Neither of the AC units in our two room suite worked properly and were so dirty the front grills appeared brown, not the off white a simple wipe revealed. Maid service - towels here today, gone tomorrow. Seems like it is to much trouble to carry new towels in after removing the ones we hung to dry. Every evening was a towel surprise. Then there was the day of NO maid service at all. Code violations, I saw several. The three that stand out most were the missing strikers to gain access to enclosed fire extinguishers, chained and padlocked emergency exits and the best of all was the ice maker (which ran but did not make ice) where a 15 amp machine was attached to a 5 amp computer power strip with 2 burned out plugs dangling in an outdoor breezeway. I guess as each plug burns out they move to the next. It was on the third of five; I wonder how much the fire marshal would fine them for this fire hazard. Internet access is not dependable. Many lights in parking lot and in walkways were not working. Bad neighborhood for a poorly lit parking lot. The waterpark itself was old, faded and rusted. Skip the $8 breakfast and go to the Rodeo Dinner where the food is fresh, hot and tastes good. Overall this place is a dump. Two redeeming qualities: it is close to the Silver Spur Arena and has easy access to the Florida Turnpike. I feel given the condition of the neighborhood and this Clarion property, Choice Hotels must be planning to close this location and unwilling to do minimum maintenance much less take proper care of the place. I\u2019m sure sometime during the last century this was a nice hotel with its own waterpark, however those days have long passed. We contacted Choice Hotels about changing hotels; we were ignored.

I was happy though to have a room to fit my wife and five children (double queen suite w/ bunkbeds and pull out sofa).

The carpets were clean, the beds were comfortable, and there didn't seem to be any bug problems for the 4 nights we stayed. We stayed during the week after Christmas so I imagine there was a high occupancy. I say that before stating that the towel situation was horrible. Daily our towels were taken as expected, but daily we had to call the front desk for towels to be replaced. Three of the four days we had to wait 30 to 90 minutes to have towels brought up which normally I wouldn't care about, but after having spent the day at a theme park and it being after 10pm... The last day we were able to get towels within 10 minutes of calling, but it would have been best if the towels were just replaced as soon as the old ones were taken. The location wasn't great for the attractions, and as much as I hate to contribute to a toll road, it was a necessity.

First off, they claimed to have a gym when I called and when I walked in to pay the front desk I even asked again if they had a gym and they said yes. Well they didn't say that the gym was out of order. Everything in the fitness room had an out of order sign on it. And as we were walking by everything we came across had out of order signs on it as we passed by. Plus there was no tv in the gym and it was really not good equipment to begin with. It wasn't even close to being state of the art. The room was terribly disgusting, with big stains on the floor. The lamp post was bent like someone had punched it in. The bathroom was small and dirty. The shower was simply terrible. Only was little stream of water came out of the shower faucet. They looked like they tried to decorate pretty, but it was still a throwback from the 70's. There was cobwebs in the corner of the room. The mattress was the only good thing about the whole place. It was soft and comfy. The room was also quiet, and the maids never banged on the door until we left. My husband didn't like the lighting in the parking lot. It was very creepy and there were sketchy people walking around. I asked for a first floor, and they gave us a top floor all the way on the end, and there was nobody there hardly other then the bums walking around. I also was charged a $15 resort fee on top of the room which we booked online. We weren't even using the park. They didn't have a bar open, and we still were charged a resort fee. Online they don't mention this fee. I was disappointed with this clarion. If I would have known this hotel was going to be so bad and didn't have a gym I would have stayed at the red roof two miles from where I needed to be for $20.00 or less.

An hour later the room still hadn't cooled off. So we went downstairs to talk to the desk and saw the AC repair man sprayed the nasty moldy water into the walkway.Gross. The gentleman said we could move b/c of the AC but made no apology about the cleanliness. So, I asked if all the rooms were like that is said just shouldn't be.

Irlo Bronson Highway Kissimmee, Florida 34744-4905 Dear Mr. Patrick: I am very disappointed in my last visit to your facility, April 29, 2011 \u2013 May 2, 2011. We have stayed there numerous time over the last six years and have watched the water-park develop. Your facility has continued to go down hill at a rapid rate. This last weekend we had three rooms that we covered the bills for; a king suite 3308, a twin room 3005, and a king 2106. All three were not just dirty but filthy. Secondly, the 3305 room had two dirty towels in the shower area when they took possession, the suite had sticky tables, and trash in one of the cans. On Saturday morning, as we headed to a family funeral, we called the operator from the suite to asked the cleaning folks to refold the couch in the living area after remaking it because we were not going to need it Saturday. They did not refold it. This was important as we had a family roundtable scheduled in the suite ofter the funeral. We were really set back after calling for room service after using it during our last visit to your hotel. I called to order a couple of pizzas Saturday evening. I was told by in house operator the phone did not work in the restaurant. She instructed me to walk down and place the order. I stated that was not a good plan. She then said she would place the order. I stated fine but she could not tell me what types of pizza they had. Very poor service as well as her very rude approach. We then received a call from the gentleman who made the pizzas but said we would have to come to pick them up. Very poor room service. Finally, none of the bills for the rooms were placed outside the rooms as in the past. I had to stop at the front desk for all three to be printed out. I then had my car boxed in. It was very frustrating. Also, you managed to bill both my son Robert Shelbrick and me for his room 2106. Please credit his card and send me a copy of the credit. Overall the service, cleanliness, and quality of your hotel has gone rapidly down hill. I would appreciate your comments and thoughts before I write \u201cTrip Advisor\u201d as I have done in the past. Please see the attached. I am not sure how many other ways you could have messed up but it was a very disappointing trip all around. We have, as stated before, have stayed at your facility numerous times in the past and have recommended to others. This will not happen again without major adjustments. Best to you.

We had 4 kids ages 1.5-12 and 4 adults. We found the room to be clean but somewhat worn and the exterior of the hotel to be in need of some major TLC. Overall, the hotel was adequate and is a decent deal for the money, but when you factor in the location, it\u2019s hard to recommend staying here. The waterpark was a different story, it is in need of a complete overhaul. There is paint and rust issues in a lot of the features of the waterpark , and most concerning even in the toddler section. The lazy river was by far the best feature, but due to overcrowding and a lack of lifeguard control over some unruly kids, it was a little beyond relaxing. In comparison, we stayed at CoCo Key hotel at the end of last year, and were blown away. They had a huge staff of lifeguards and it had much more of an waterpark feel vs the hotel with slides feeling at clarion. There was also very little if any condition issues at CoCo Key, it felt safe and was well maintained. In addition, the arcade completely blows clarion\u2019s out of the water.

Searching through various travel sites, we came across what loked like an exceptional opportunity. Instead all we discovered was disappointment. First, the location. Possibly the absolute worst location imaginable. Most businesses in the area have long been out of business, as such, there is nothing but abandoned storefront after abandoned storefront in the area. We actually passed the hotel more than once trying to find it, as it is set back from the lonely road, accesible only through a field of overgrown grass, dotted by old, paint-peeling statues guarding a pothole-strewn driveway. The waterpark may be entertaining, but really only for those under the age of 7. There isn't enough water flow on the slides, as such most over 50 lbs will have to \"scooch\" down. The lazy river is very shallow and has no real current. In stark contrast, the swimming pool is 4 ft - 8 ft, and as such is really only for those who truly have good swimming skills. The rooms are average Clarion/ Comfort Inn style rooms. As such, they were relatively clean, with no bugs. Though, the furniture, outside of the bedding did show signs of age and stains. There was no carpet in our room, likely because of the expectations of it getting wet from \"waterpark\"/pool use. The BIGGEST downside to this property is that there is no security for the parking lot. Eventually, we ended up talking with some of the pool patrons who lived nearby and were using the pool facilities as their own. Apparently, this pool is considered the community pool. The property truly underwhelms, in spite of the overpromising found online. It lies smack-dab in the middle of what can only be called a ghost town. The rooms are average , while the waterpark is suitable only for little ones. Older children will quickly grow bored of the facility.

I was looking for a nice waterpark-style hotel to take my three boys for a quick weekend getaway without spending a fortune (see: Nick Jr. hotel). I found this hotel online, read the reviews, and got a great rate for the family suite, so we took the plunge. Getting to the hotel was no bargain. We took the exit off of I-4 and thought we were maybe 10 minutes away. Low and behold, we had to take the \"road from hell\" all the way down to the turnpike, and it was bumper to bumper and red-lights every 500 feet. Of course, after I asked on arrival about a different route, i was told that there was a much easier way to get there (which worked great when we left, by the way). I was nervous upon arrival because the description of my room on my confirmation differed from what I was told on the phone when I booked, but to my pleasant surprise, the room was everything we needed and more. I am a loud snorer, so it's imperative for me and my kids to sleep in separate rooms, and the description on my confirmation said \"partition\", not separate BR. However, the living area was indeed separated from the back bedroom, which was a huge relief. There was a 42\" flat screen in the living area, along with a sofabed, a set of bunk beds, and a small kitchen (no stove). The bedroom was two queen beds, a 32\" flat screen, and a balcony over the pool, which was outstanding. The only negatives were that there were no pots, pans, plates, cups, or anything in the cabinets to support the kitchen, and there was no stove for cooking. But, we made do with the microwave and eating out, and bought some plastic plates and cutlery at the dollar store. Immediately upon arrival, the kids headed for the waterpark, and we were greeted by a very friendly young lady, who checked our name off of the list and let us in the gate. The kids were occupied, so I hit the outdoor Tiki bar for a cocktail, and was taken care of very nicely by the bartender (Jessica I believe). She turned on the NCAA games for me on the TV, and I was very relaxed and enjoying myself while the kids played (my kids are 10, 11, and 14, so more than capable of playing without constant supervision; they checked in every 30 minutes with me). My only complaints about the bar were: 1)Between taking care of drink orders, serving food, and having to deal with kids wanting \"virgin\" frozen drinks, the bartender was a bit overwhelmed at times, and could've used a barback or another bartender, especially during the busiest time of day; and 2) The food selection was very limited, and not what I would call \"bar food\", save for a couple of selections (hot dogs, wings). Would've loved to have seen a more \"bar-friendly\" menu. And $13.95 for a cheese pizza? I know it's a resort, but come on...! Overall, we had a great stay. The bed slept very well, the A/C cooled perfectly (this is a big issue in many hotels), and the staff was very friendly. We did have a few housekeeping miscues: 1) There were no sheets between the spread and bottom sheet on the bunkbeds, so we had to call for those; 2) the spreads were \"fitted\", in that the corners were elastic as to fit around the mattress. This was awkward for sleeping purposes; and 3) our room was serviced on our 2nd day, but no towels were left, and we did not discover this until we were getting ready to go out for dinner, at which time I had to call twice to request towels, and finally received them about 45 minutes later, which put us behind on our dinner plans. And, on the 2nd day of housekeeping service, the young lady made up the bunk beds, but took the middle sheets that we had just requested the day before, so we had to request them again, this time at night as the kids were getting ready for bed, another delay. I finally took the sheets off of the 2nd bed in my room and used them so that the boys could go to bed. Highs and lows? The pool area was definitely great, the staff was super-friendly, and the room layout was absolutely perfect for our needs. As for lows, besides what was listed above, the wireless connection was very weak. There appeared to be three different wireless connections, but all three read \"poor\" when I checked their status. As a result, the computer was running very slow during the majority of our stay. Also, only one elevator (that we knew of) made it difficult to get up to the 3rd floor at times. And the arcade was a disappointment to my kids, because it was mainly games of chance as opposed to arcade-style games. We will definitely make a return visit in the future. I do want to check on one other similar-style property, but for value, comfort, and location, this hotel will be hard to beat.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWhat is a resort fee?\u201d", "Author": "DonkeyHoove69", "ReviewID": "UR100564175", "Content": "Located right off the tollway, shares a driveway with a used RV lot/mechanic, right around the corner from a jail - just in case you misbehave in the waterpark.

Not exactly sure what the resort fee is applied to? The not hot-hot tub is located within the maximum security locked gate of the water park and closes at 5 PM. There is no hot tub right next to the pool, which is open later. I had no problem with my bed but the other traveler in my group woke up with small red bites all over his legs and back, glad I chose the bed I did.

Also, when we requested a rollaway bed for an extra guest we were only given a blanket. I basically walked down the waterslide/scooted down, very low water pressure. The lazy river is more like a stagnant pond. There is no current and you have to pull yourself along or walk. After viewing the stairs to the waterslide from underneath I was cautious walking up them after seeing how thin and rusty the metal is. Only good thing I can say about the waterpark is that the girl that worked in the booth was hot.

Our adult children slept in them and complained. One son even moved the top bunk mattress down on top of the bottom bunk mattress to give it some comfort. We did like the setup of the suites which is like a small apartment. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. However, housekeeping left much to be desired. We always seemed to have a large amount of toiletries left for us but very few bath towels, no hand towels and an occasional face cloth. Our kleenex ran out on the second day and was never replaced. Our coffee and tea supplies ran out and were never replaced, even when we left housekeeping a note. And one night we came home to find that housekeeping had left our door unlocked and just stacked a bunch of bath towels on the open sofa sleeper.

The carpet is stained. You can barely turn around in the bathroom. The ac took about 6 hours to cool the room down. The waterpark is little more than a fancy pool area. Yes there are 3 flumes, but the lazy river around them is narrow and feels like bath water. It is also open to the public. Nice huh? I didn't realize that. It also costs $15 a day to use it. On top of that, they claim to be a smoke free resort. Well, that is a lie because there are \"smokers poles\" every 10 feet or so, many of them located right outside the doors to the rooms. One was on fire and nobody seemed to care. My husband went over and poured water on it so we wouldn't have to sit out there and smell it. Oh yeah, the best part was the breakfast buffet. I have never stayed at a Clarion where I have had to pay for breakfast! It has always been provided free. Well, we go down to the buffet and end up spending $26 for 4 people. The coffee was cold as was everything else on the hot bar. Then when I looked at the receipt, I saw I was charged 18% gratuity (almost $5) for a freakin buffet!! The waitress did absolutely nothing but bring me another cup of cold coffee when I complained about the first. Hindsight is 20/20. I wish we had never unpacked the car. I can tell you this.

I new right away, but it was to late to do anything about it and my kids were to excited. The elevator to our room smelled like urine and the room doors are all on the outside of the building, very route 66.

The lazy river is only two feet deep and very narrow and filled with double rafts that can't fit past each other.

Did I mention you did not have to be a guest of the hotel to use the facilities? They also have a general admission price for locals. Scary. After a long day of lounging in the soupy water with my new friends, at least I wouldn't have to go far for a good night rest right? Wrong! Our air conditioner didn't work properly and the room was about 80 and set to 70. There was a crack in our ceiling and in the middle of the night it started to leak water on my daughter and we had to move the bed over to the wall.

The only reason I did not bash the staff was because when I complained about all of this to the lady at the front desk, who frankly I feel sorry for she has to work at such a hole... she sent us a free pizza for lunch.

This hotel is not in a good area and I would not be caught by myself in the parking lot or far from my room after dark. The water in the water park reminded me of the commercial on tv, where the guys jump into the pool filled with caramel, it is warm and feels very thick not to mention the hair and used bandaids.

Now the handyman has come up and is going to fix are ac but wait a minute he has a phone call now we must wait for his phone call to be done before he continues and tells us the last person to clean the ac must have left the vents open for the hot air from outside to come in and that is should start working right away. Ok now we shall leave for a little while and then check on it when we come back the room is just as hot and we call the manager she says she can not change are room to the available suite she was holding for us just in case because there is a plumbing issue in that room and that she would send a fan up (SERIOUSLY). At this point I am almost in tears it is getting late and I am ready to pack up and leave when my mother and sister went down to talk to the manager personally we finally got her to switch us now into 2 separate rooms and that she would send someone with a cart to help us move that never happened it was ridiculous. Oh and the two roaches that we saw in are room to but ya know it is florida but rooms should be sprayed once a month at least if you are having those kind of problems and call yourself a resort. When my sister stepped outside for a moment she went downstairs and the manager happened to be walking by with a smile on her face my sister was beside herself and told her \"don't smile at me\", the girl I am sure did not know what to do but at this point is 9:30 at nite and we still do not have the baby to sleep because of everything are family has now been separated and she has the gull to smile about it. With a but chewing from my sister they dropped the price of the room to 73.00 and we did not have to check out until 6pm rather then 11am, free breakfast that really was not great and I am shocked that they actually charge 10.99 for this. They comped some drinks which I ordered a long Island Ice tea after everything we went through and of coarse they did not have sour mix to put in it. The waterpark is wonderful but could probably use a little more help but we did have a great time with the kids and it is the perfect size when you have a 6 year old, five year old and a baby they wore themselves out with the park and I would love to go back to that but shall never use there rooms again.

I could not believe I had payed my hard-earned money to stay in a dump. I tried to remain positive. There is a large clearing in front of the property that needs to be landscaped or sat on fire. For some reason, they only cut around the perimeter of this opening and leave the grass within the area to grow up and look awful. The property is lined with the hotel's mascot, Mindy-O the green octopus. There are several of these around the property. The money spent on these statues and the other statues would have been better spent on clean/soft towels and bath cloths, bug spray, and new bed linens to say the least. When we checked in, Shirley at the Front Desk was very nice. At this point, it was too late to try to find better accommodations and I knew from the looks of the place a refund was out of the question. My toddler and I stayed in the car and sent my hubby to scout the room. I was sickened just waiting in the parking lot. I had been told by front desk that she placed me by the water park as if that was a plus. I guess it was but we had to park in the rear of the building, walk through a dark corridor, and around the corner to get to our room. Not to mention we had to park near the commercial dumpsters about 8 of them that looked like they had not been dumped since New Year's. My husband and I tried to figure out if maybe they just had not paid the trash bill or if the city of Kissimmee was just slacking on their sanitation duties. The dumpsters were overflowing and the spaces in front, behind, and beside were littered with large bags of trash. My husband came back to say the room looked decent and to come inside. We did not want to make several trips so we grabbed all we could and went to the room. We did not want to risk being out and about as the neighborhood this \"resort\" is in is not the best. When I stepped in the room, I have to say that I was surprised to see it looked as nice as it did. We got a room with 2 standard beds, fridge, and microwave. We soon found out that our room did not have a remote for the tv or wash cloths. I did not mind the wash cloths at first because I had packed some of my own. I called the front desk and asked for both anyway. They sent the wash cloths but it took a while for them to bring the remote. When they did it was raggedy and falling apart. I was thankful that I heard the manager mutter the code because for the 4 days I stayed there my husband and I had to repeatedly reprogram the code in the remote for it to work. Which was a waste of time because, the volume of the tv came and went at will. We could turn it all the way up and it would still be silent for about 15-20 minutes before it re-gained sound only to go right back out with in a minute or so. The hotel never replenished shampoo, conditioner, or soap (again I brought my own soap so I saved myself a headache there). They brought towels everyday but no wash cloths and after that I did not even bother to ask them for any. This place has a serious roach problem. I only saw baby roaches but I still did not appreciate it and worried that I may bring them home with me. Also, the sheets felt gritty and had holes in them, I am guessing they are either from wear and tear or cigarette burns. The towels were dingy, hard, and still had spots, stains, and other foreign matter in the fibers. My son loved the water park. I thought it was nice but the kiddie area of it had poor (and on some equipment no) water flow so my son had to play in the adult section which was packed at times. The doorknob to the bathroom was barely connected and the toilet tissue roll and mount fell out the wall whenever we attempted to get toilet tissue. After this kept happening, my husband just took the roll off and placed it on the tub wall. I guess the housekeeper tired of it too because he/she just left additional rolls on the tub wall as well. Housekeeping did not \"refresh\" the room properly. The staff seemed to be stingy with toiletries and linens. I kept feeling things in the bed but at times was too afraid to look. The chairs in the rooms had stains and need to be replaced. It seems as if this place is in the process of re-vamping. It may be in their best interest to close until they can operate in a clean and orderly manner. The Wi-Fi is a joke. It took me about an hour to get a connection. I was kicked off several times. I finally gave up. Please don't depend on it. Please do not be fooled by the pictures this place has posted on the website. They are an utter LIE. The locks on the rooms do not work. On our last day there, we never had to use the key card. We could simply just walk in. The key card went from not working at all to the lock not working at all.

We received free Disney park tickets for viewing an off-site resort (Vacation Village at the Parkway, which was very nice). Prior to checking in, request building 1 (where we stayed) or building 2 (most up-to-date). Also, know that they charge a daily resort fee of $15/day. The room included a microwave & refridgerator (nice option when you have children) This is an average hotel, looks like they're attempting to re-build and re-brand the hotel. We checked in on Thursday, May 20th and decided to hang-out at the pool. We have a 7 year old son that had a blast! They have 3 water slides (fun & life guards on duty), a lazy river that goes around the slides (relaxing), a hot tub, a separate pool and a kiddie area. The waterslides close fairly early (10a-6p), however, the big pool remains open later. The also had an arcade with separate staffed kiddie rooms for arts/crafts (thought that was neat). Also, we hung out at the pool the morning of our check-out. The lobby and the grounds were well maintained. They have an on-site restaurant with excellent priced options, however, we never ate there. Coffee was great and they offer buy 1, get 1 free margaritas during happy hour with a live DJ (that was fun)! Housekeeping was somewhat annoying. Although they \"refreshed\" the rooms everyday, we had to remind them every night to bring us new towels. The location of the hotel was yucky! LOL! It was very close to the toll road (which could be a plus based on where you're going). But there was alot of abandoned buildings and looked like they were attempting to revitalize the area. However, if you drive to 1 street over (parallel), the view is much more up-dated and nice. Overall, if you have children, want to save $$, and you're focus mainly going to the Theme Parks, I'd recommend this hotel. The staff were friendly towards us. After hanging out at the parks, we really just wanted to return for a shower and crash anyway, then get up and do it all over again (smile).

The hotel is in a declining neighborhood, is not visually appealing, and is way overpriced for what you get.

If there weren't any cars or people there you would think it was abandoned, like a lot of other properties in the immediate area. It was not a \"resort\" scene, that's for sure. The second bad sign was when I walked in the lobby to check in there was someone there complaining to the manager. As I was checking in I could hear about all the things that were wrong with her room.. The girl who checked me in was nice, and we got our keys without a problem. The problem came when we got to our room, opened the door and there was someone's stuff all over the room. It was not vacant. No one was home, but all of their belongings were. So we loaded the car back up, drove back around to the office to get a new room. The kid behind the counter this time looked confused. He handed me another key and said \"try this room\". Try?? Is it vacant or not. Guess what.. it wasnt! He gave me a key to another persons room that was not vacant. The software they use at this \"resort\" needs an upgrade. I returned and was told \"it's an honest mistake\". At this point I did not feel safe checking in to another room. How many times would they issue someone else a key to my room by mistake.?? I wasn't going to let that happen. During my short time there I did notice the place looks beat. Not just the property, but the slides and the pool. And the hours wouldn't allow any time for the slides because we had planned to hit the parks. They close the slides at 5. Lame. Stay away. The place is gross and mis managed.

The idea of a waterpark hotel is great. The hotel itself needs a better sign so that you can find it, because you cannot see the waterpark as you approach and the sign just says \"Clarion Resort\". The address is on Irlo Bronson but the entrance isn't so there was some confusion. We could see it, but we couldn't get to it!! That has nothing to do with the hotel itself though, just a comment. The hotel was very neat and clean inside. We were given the wrong room (we had booked double queen suite but got a single queen suite) but there was no issue with getting it all fixed up. Our room seemed to have been updated with modern furniture and lcd tvs. The bed was very comfortable with nice bedding. The kitchenette was great with the full sized fridge and microwave. The waterpark was very nice too, but the operating hours were out to lunch. It was open from I believe 10:30 am or 11 am to 5 p.m. Those are the hours that most people with families are at the local Theme Parks. So we arrived at 5:05 pm only to find out we couldn't use the facilities. When we hadn't used the waterpark at all and had been there for 2 days, we decided to stay back one day and just use them. It was a bit of a rainy day (we didn't have great weather) but the 8 year old that we were with loved it. So just so you are aware, you pay to use that waterpark everyday, but if you are doing day trips, you won't be able to use it. My personal opinion is that it needs to open by 9 a.m. and stay open until 7 pm so that you can get an hour on either side of a theme park day. It would make for happy kids and happy parents. We ate at the pool snack bar and the food was good. The bartender I think was Jimmy and he was very nice. The main pool was open much later and it was very nice. The hot tub is in the waterpark area so it wasn't available outside of the waterpark hours. that too would have been nice if it was in the main pool area so that it would have extended hours. Overall we liked our room, but we really wanted to use the waterpark and had we not opted to miss a theme park day, we wouldn't have even been able to use it because of the limited operating hours. oh and the free wi-fi isn't very good.

I called the front desk and it was fixed before we got back from swimming. The waterpark was great. No, it's not a full on waterpark, but you shouldn't go expecting that. Is is more fun than just a pool? Absolutely. The lazy river was comfortable and relaxing, the slides were fun. The regular pool was just the right size and refreshing. The rooms looked exactly like the pictures. We loved every minute of it. My constructive comments aren't even that bad. The only things that we thought were odd were that the hot tub was located in the waterpark and the waterpark closed at 7pm. So it's not accessible. Not many people are going to use a hot tube in the middle of 90 degree weather during the day. Also, the game room said that it was open from 7am to 1pm. Now in a theme park town, kids aren't even going to be at the motel during those hours. And we wanted to play games when we got back. Oh well...I had never stayed on that end of 192 before, so I did get turned around a few times, because it was a little out of the way. But honestly, if you were to go through all the stoplights of Kissimmee to get to Orlando instead of just getting back on the turnpike beside the motel, it would take you longer. So, once we figured that out, everything was great. Those are minor things. It in no way would keep us from staying there again. We commend everyone that works for the motel.

Needless to say, no one got out, and my children did not get to swim. Shortly afterwards, my kids came back to the pool only to be told that the pool was closing because the handle that is on the steps needed to be fixed. SO, my children did not get to swim as we were told they would be able too. The buffet was less than desired. It consisted of Fried Chicken that was in the warmer and looked soggy, their carrots and peas looked soggy, there was no soup, the one salad that they had was not desirable. The pizza looked as though it had been sitting out for a while and did not look appetizing. The buffet cost $9.95 and I'm glad we looked to see their buffet before purchasing as we ended up leaving there and going elsewhere. The toilet was very noisy. Every time the toilet was flushed it made a terrible sound, the air conditioner that ran woke my entire family up during the night due to the noise of it turning on. The waterpark was less than desired. There were not enough rafts for the lazy river which posed a problem as there were several children that did not get to use the rafts.

The servers in the AM were not on time (we had to eat at Denny's once morning b/c we had to get to our destination by 730am - servers were late so restaurant couldnt open), not well trained and showed very little interest in being of assistance.

The location is convenient just off the turnpike. I thought the cost was very reasonable (suite deal birthday package). As for the waterpark: I had quite a time getting anyone to answer the phone when I was trying to book everything. One young lady rushed me off a call because she was \"trying to get out of there\". The waterpark staff were friendly and courteous, I would attribute their lack of professionalism to youth. I don't think any of them were over 21. The young lady who coordinated the birthday events seemed seriously overworked. The \"waterpark\" is basically three pretty large waterslides, a shallow pool shaped like a giant \"O\" that you can float around on tubes, and several smaller versions of these things for very young kids. There is also a regular pool separate from the waterpark area. The waterpark area also includes a bar/cafe where my service was excellent. Part of my deal included the use of a \"cabana\", which was about a 10'x10' aluminum frame covered with canvas. You could close it completely or open it completely or adjust it anywhere in between. It came with a ceiling fan, table, chairs, a lounge, and a special float for the \"O\" (lazy river) pool. The cabana was very welcome relief from the burning sun and sweltering heat and they are arranged around the periphery of the waterpark area providing nice views. The waterpark was packed to capacity the day I was there, and all the kids were having a blast, especially the younger ones! There were several lifeguards on duty (teenage boys) at all times.

The only issues we had with the room was the tv remote was broken, and the shower curtain did not meet with the bottom of the shower stall. The shower had one of the new curved bars, so the water went right down the curtain and onto the floor. Just a minor inconvenience. The waterpark was amazing. Our trip was for our daughter's 5th birthday. She wasnt tall enough to ride the big slides, but she would've been too scared to ride them anyway. My husband used them though and loved them. The lazy river was fun, although it gets kind of crowded at times. The kids' play area was fun. We stayed in the swimming pool most of the time though because it was less crowded than the water park. There are a few cabanas there, and I recommend calling in advance to reserve one. I called a week ahead of time and reserved the last one for that day. The cabana came with a table, 4 chairs, a lounge chair, ceiling fan, and flat screened tv. It also came with a 2-person float for the lazy river. They cost $5 to rent them for the day otherwise. The tv was a wonderful surprise. When our 6-month old was ready to nap, we took turns watching her and the tv. If you are going to the Disney parks, I probably would not stay here. It is really far from everything. I would estimate it as at least 10 miles or more from I-4. There really isnt much around the hotel either. You have to drive back into Kissimmee a ways to get to decent restaurants. But, if the waterpark is your destination, I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando,fl", "Title": "\u201cvery clean\u201d", "Author": "ladybugOrlando_fl", "ReviewID": "UR31105024", "Content": "I recently booked a room on memorial day weekend and I was amazed with the cleanliness of the hotel room.

If he were writing the review, he would say sell your house and move into the hotel. We took a small family vacation over Spring Break. My wife and I enjoyed the jacuzzi in the room and my boy just LOVED the waterpark and the game room. The trip was a lot of fun and the hotel was a great \"home\" to return to each night, but let me mention both the good and the bad about this place. I will start with the bad. There were four main things that were negative. 1) When we arrived there was a long, long line of people waiting to check in (8 plus the 3 being helped by staff). My first 17 minutes in the hotel were not pleasant as I stood in line. This led me to notice how there were 3 lights burned out in the lobby and a dirty maintenance cart parked right beside the main entrance. Nit picky stuff, I know, but I had already spent the day walking around an amusement park and did not want to stand in yet another long, slow-moving line. 2) When we first got to the room, my boy turned on the TV and it came on to the hotel channel. The channel had no sound on its own and had a radio station as its sound. Within 2 minutes of our arrival, while I was still looking at the different ammenities of the hotel, the TV (or rather the radio station that was the sound) said \"Hell yeah! bust a cap in dose mother-effers\" I would think that a family waterpark hotel might choose a different radios station as their background music. 3) The ice machine for our building was broken. This made the closest ice machine a full building length and 1 flight of stairs away from our room. 4) The room had no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. So the morning after the first night, we were awakened by the maid coming into our room. On the positive side of things was more stuff than can be listed. The waterpark was a lot of fun! The jacuzzi in the room was a blessing after long days spent on our feet. The free internet connection was good. The TV had a nice quality picture for the little bit of TV watching that we did. Room service pizza was excellent. The staff was friendly, polite and helpful. The shuttle service was timely and very good. The arcade was fun. The rooms were well-stocked with appliances (coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, iron, ironing board) plus you could get a dvd player from the lobby if you wanted one.

Some enterprising individual took an old motel in a not fantastic location, made some renovations and decided to build a \"waterpark\" to draw extra traffic. Voila! The Clarion Resort & Waterpark. The first thing you need to know is that \"waterpark\" is a bit of a stretch. They have 2 nice looking slides, but my preteens panned them. \"Too slow\" and \"you get stuck\" where the complaints. There's also a 2 foot \"lazy river\" that circles the slides -- it's OK, but it's not really deep enough or long enough for any adult or older kid to enjoy. There is also a conventional pool and hot tub, as well as some other water features that young kids (say, under 8) would enjoy. Indeed, the water features make this property a good choice for those with younger kids. Older kids might be a bit disappointed. The other \"problem\" with their set-up is that most of the water features (except the conventional swimming pool) are closed from 5 pm to 10 am, so you can't use them for a little entertainment on an overnight stop. Frankly, that's what the facilities are best for -- an hour or two's diversion. The park isn't nice enough to be a \"destination resort,\" so keeping the waterpark only open during daytime hours is a bit odd. Otherwise, the property is typical of a Choice Hotels motel (quality inn, comfort inn, etc), which it is. By calling it a \"Clarion,\" they get out of having to give you a free continental breakfast (although I understand they are considering providing one in the future). The rooms are up-to-date and are comfortable, but have the old-style outside entrances and big picture window. The refrigerator and microwave are obviously handy. The staff were all pleasant to deal with. If you have any use for the waterpark, the rates are quite reasonable here, although they \"get you\" with that $12 resort fee -- which certainly can be a bit unreasonable for overnight travellers who don't get to use the facility. The other thing you should know about is the location. If you're headed to Disney, it's a long drive on a very congested Route 192. You'll want to pay the massively overpriced toll (currently almost $3) to take the Osceola Pkwy to the Turnpike. Trust me, it's worth it. I think the property is a bit far afield to use to go back and forth to Disney. It would make a reasonable one-night stay if you're arriving early enough to use the waterpark.

I picked this resort because of the Water Park feature. We have a 3 year old daughter who was being treated to Disney & wanted something fun for her to do on the 1st day of arrival. The hotel allows you to access the Water Park on the day of your arrival & even allowed us to check-in early. We were fearful as a cold front had travelled through Florida the day before, but the pools and lazy lagoon were all heated so it was a very enjoyable afternoon. Now, I work for a big 4 star Preferred Resort in the Florida Keys, so I wasn't expecting luxurious accomodations, but I will tell you that this resort exceeded our expectations! The rooms were very nice and clean and the bedding was very fluffy with 4 pillows on each bed. The mini kitchen area was very helpful with a sink, microwave, mini fridge and coffee pot. I even discovered the ingenious \"hidden\" clothesline in the bathtub! The rooms are all equipped with flat screen tvs, desks and a chair in a seating area. The hotel also offers a business center as well as a game room \"arcade\" which kept my little one entertained and amused. We were also very impressed with how attentive the lifeguards were. At one point the female lifeguard called to another mother and told her not to worry because she was able to spot their little one floating in the lazy lagoon and the little girl was fine. She watched everyone in the pool area - at all times - very attentive! We will definitely recommend this resort to other travelers we know. After reading the past reviews - I wasn't too worried, even our gorgeous 4-star Resort in the Keys gets some nasty comments every now and then. Most negative reviews are derived from travelers that find one thing wrong and can't seem to find any \"roses in the flower pot without thorns\". Also - if you book through a 3rd Party, they will never tell you about the Resort Fee, but you WILL pay it at any hotel (we run into the same situation at our Hotel with guests booking through expedia & travelocity, etc.). If you ever saw the Resort I work for in the Keys - you would be amazed that we ever got anything less than wonderful praise.

When checking out, the resort fee had inflated to $13.56,per nite, including taxes. The Resort is about 16 miles in stop and go traffic on 192 from Disney. The linens and towels were great. The bed was somewhat on the hard side, and the pillows too thin. The shower head was good, but the shower curtain didn't make it down to the shower edge and extended over the bathroom floor. To keep from flooding the room I had to hug the wall, and aim the shower to the wall. Wasn't impressed with the \"French Milled\" soap, but there were Neutragena (sp?) lotion, shampoo, and conditioner. The heat worked great! Housekeeping was not very adept at making the bed, my grand kids do a better job! The same little particles of stuff were on the floor for the duration, indicating the floor wasn't cleaned. The floor is ceramic tile...good, and bad points. My main critique was that you could join in your adjoining room conversation, if so desired. There was no threshold on the ceramic floor between the room allowing light and conversation to enter your privacy. I really thought someone was in my room when I was awoken by my neighbors. You could actually understand very well what was being said. The noise from housekeeping, and laundry carts was loud too. I thought it was close jet planes overhead. The safe was locked upon my arrival necessitating 2 trips from maintenance. There were 2 bulbs out over the sink, and the towel rack was balanced on the wall, but would fall off when you touched the towel. There were no Kleenexes, and when I asked for some was told there weren't any, and was offered a roll of Toilet Paper, which was not of \"facial\" softness. In my 3 night stay, no kleenex. The refrigerator froze the soft drinks I placed in the door compartment. It had been turned up to max...guess I should have checked it when I checked in, or maybe housekeeping should add this to their routine! When I checked out I gave the clerk a written list that they may want to address for room 4101. She just said \"OK, thanks\". Not a 2 1/2 star...more a 1 1/2, in my opinion. This place would be great for families in good weather,the room was nice, but the $12, er $13,56, fee is too much for the amenities.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piscataway, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGood For Families\u201d", "Author": "Luvtravel", "ReviewID": "UR23518729", "Content": "Stayed at the Clarion 12/26/08- 1/2/09 to ring in the new Year with Disney.

I booked this hotel through Priceline, but I did not get notified of this \"resort fee\" when my offer price was accepted by this hotel.

The door between the living area and bedroom was a regular hotel room connector with a door on each side. The bedroom had it's own entrance. At one point they were two seperate rooms.

We chose the Clarion due to the mostly positive feedback coupled with the cost. We stayed four nights (Dec 9 - 12) in a Queen Suite on the top (3rd) floor. Driving in, I was a little leery because of the location to the highway and the somewhat under-construction-semi-rundown look of the property around the hotel. But once we entered our room, we were very encouraged by the look and layout of our room. It was very spacious in the living room area which had a huge (50 inch?) plasma and bunk bed for the kids. The furniture was clean and looked very new, along with new tile & cupboards in the kitchenette and hallway area. The carpet was nice and clean along with the bathroom. It was obvious the hotel was remodeled within the last few years - they did a great job in the rooms. The queen beds were comfortable. And there was another plasma in the bedroom. I think a 42 inch. The view was very nice - the suites include a private balcony which overlooks the waterpark. Now for the waterpark...I liked it a lot. We've got a 6 yr old, 4 yr old and 18 mo old. The slides were great because they ended in something like 6 inches of water so no fear of a younger kid having trouble by getting dumped into a huge pool or anything. My 6 year old loved the slides. My 4 year old was quite a bit too short so she hung out in the lazy river and with her 18 month old sibling in the kiddy waterpark area. Location...The hotel sits right on one of the main drags in Kissimmee/Orlando. Hwy 192 (3 lane divided road with moderate traffic) which is less a highway and more a county road type street. I think the speed limit is 45 or something. Anyway, you get on 192 right out of the parking lot and 30 minutes later you will be at the Magic Kingdom/Epcot/etc gate. It's a nice, easy drive that even I couldn't screw up. Food...Go left or right (east or west) on 192. Within 5 to 10 minutes in either direction you have every fast food restaurant known to man. Sonic, McDonalds, BK, DQ, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, etc. You also have Target, Wal Mart, Sams Club, BJs, Winn Dixie, etc. Seriously...you'll find everything. All in all, I feel great that we saved probably $500 to $700 on our hotel stay versus a comparable Disney hotel room.

Even when I showed the Clarion manager my Expedia receipt that showed an extra $23/day fee ($10 taxes, $13 other), they still argued with me for a long time. Then they finally agreed with my receipt, said they would't charge us, and then charged my credit card anyway after we went home! I left 2 messages for them to call me back on this matter, which of course they just ignored. Learn from my lesson and don't trust what they tell you. Not to dwell on this topic, but if there is a Clarion CEO out there somewhere, you need to pay attention to this. In the several times I was at the front desk arguing my case, I watched many guests check-in and check-out and be told of this extra 'manditory' $13.56/day 'Resort Fee'. I saw the shocked look on their faces and how mad they were when they left. Is that any way to run a motel? Make all your guests mad? Do you think they're going to come back? If this fee is maniditory, it should be in the price of the motel. This is deceptive advertising. As for what the other guests commented about, I can verify most. This motel is a lot farther from the theme parks than most others. The waterpark hours aren't that long - if you go to a theme park, then forget it. Their shuttle only goes once a day and it's not free to SeaWorld or Universal. There were indeed bus loads of local kids coming to the waterpark causing long lines at the slides, using up all the inner tubes for the lazy river and basically being unruly with little adult supervision. This place also has no right to call itself a 'Resort'. It is a remodeled motel of the kind where you park in front of your room. The rooms are your basic 2-3 star quality where the furniture takes up about 80% of the room. The bathroom is tiny and the water pressure in the shower is very low. The walls are paper thin and you can hear every word from the rooms around you. There was no information guide in the room and the rooms were cleaned late in the day. Another weird thing is they make you sign an agreement that you'll pay them $300 if you smoke in their room. What Clarion manager came up with that gem? I can't imagine how they'd enforce it. But I guess they are going for the scare factor (another great way to treat your guests!). This of course, led to all the smokers smoking in the corridors which cheapened the place in a different way! There were a few good things. The place is kid-friendly but mostly for the smaller kids. The rooms were clean and they had frigs and microwaves. They have another pool for after the waterpark closes. They have lots of different amenities like a gift shop, game room, computer room, kid activities, coffee in the lobby and breakfast - but be warned, they charge for all of them!", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Region of Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay .......\u201d", "Author": "Garcia745", "ReviewID": "UR18759561", "Content": "We stayed here from July 27 to August 3, 2008.

Once I got to my room, it was newly decorated, but the shower was horrible. I would not even want to think of taking a shower in it. It looked dirty and unsanitary. The kitchenette they discribed, well, its a counter with a microwave that doubles as a vanity counter. Needless to say my 4 year was excited to be there so I decided to give it a chance. As we sat in the room, my husband had bugs crawling on him. We tried to go to the \"waterpark\", which was the reason we stayed at this hotel. The person passing out the arm bands...rude. She yelled at my son not to stand on his tippy toes while she measured him and then said he was just shy of being able to go on the slides. I asked to speak to someone else, They took him to be measured by the \"accurate\" measuring device. He just went to the doctor and measured 46\", they said he was 43 1/2\" and needed to be 44\" to ride the slide. Since this was the reason we came to this \"resort\" we decided to check out. I asked to speak to a manager after advising we were checking out after only being there an hour. I was told they were in a metting. I said I didn't care. I finally got to speak to the waterpark manager. I completely understand child safety, I deal with it as a career. He said he got the \"measuring\" device from a national home improvement store. He said he would give my son an armband that may work and let him on the slide. We did not want to base our vacation on may could possibly work. The manager stated it was listed on the website, you must be 44\" to ride the slides. Well after searching for this when I returned home, because it is hidden in the description, I missed it. Even if I had seen it, since he measured taller than that at his pediatrician, wouldn't think I have to worry. Not to mention we didn't feel safe at the hotel. It is in the middle of no where and nothing close by to eat or do anything else. I was able to finally check out. We went to the other water park hotel in Orlando and the water park was larger and much better. The rooms were much cleaner and the staff much more attentive.

We were looking for an average hotel (based on price, distance to attractions, and services offerred) and use Trip Advisor extensively when planning any vacations. We also took into consideration that the hotel carried the Clarion name and we have stayed at many of the Clarion family of hoteles (Clarion, Cambria). That's the background- now here is my review....... We were disappointed overall by the distance from almost anything we tried to find (restaurants, shopping, theme parks). Despite this hotel indicating that there is a complimentary shuttle to Disney, we discovered that the shuttle to Magic Kingdom leaves at 10:30 (told to be prepared for delays due to weather) and when you add the at least 40 minute drive to that, you can bet on at least 11:20 before you hit the entrance to Magic Kingdom. That is absolutley silly because you may as well not even bother going as that is peak times and you won't get anywhere at Disney by then! We opted to use our rental car instead, which added gasoline and parking to our expenses. We were disappointed by the poor communication of most staff (I am speaking not of accent or language, but of their overall interaction with customers.) We confirmed prior to booking the hotel that a continental breakfast was included but this was not to be found when we looked each morning. Finally, near the end of our stay, when I was becoming upset about our general experience, I asked another staff, who told me that I must provide documentation to prove that it was part of our booking, and only then would she be prepared to give me the necessary voucher to have breakfast at the restaurant. Once I dug out the required documents she presented me with a coupon, which we used on our last few days there. I felt like we had to beg for virtually everything that should have just come naturally. My husband even had to go to the front dest to get a listing of TV channels, map of the hotel, and schedule of shuttles, as no general orientation manual (as is found in every other hotel room I've stayed in, even in other countries) is available. The restaurant staff were friendly and helpful. The cleanliness of our room was questionable. We noted many marks on the walls from dead insects or handprints left my other guests. Our room didn't appear to be getting any cleaning so my husband requested that it be vacuumed. It was done on the day he asked but nothing else was (ie. no towels, no cleaning in the bathroom). One day I left a few things in certain spots to see if they would be moved (eg. toilet paper roll near the toilet, loose thread on the floor near the fridge) to indicate if things were being swept, and we discovered they were still there, untouched that evening. When we asked for something we got it, but otherwise it didn't happen. We had to go to the front desk for shampoo (which we then received, but not after) and clothes (received two on our last day, the only time!), and eventually just bought our own at Target so that it was there when we needed it. We discovered tags and crumbs from previous guests purchases and food under our beds. We did not find any roaches as was noted on another review, but I can say that I kept a look out for the possibility because we found small bugs in any food that was on the counter (cookie bags, chips). If we opened anything, we either ate it all or threw it out! The hallways were dirty and sometimes covered in water (inside stairs, not from rain) which my son slipped on several times. The washer and dryer (out in the open, basically anyone could access it and take your things) were not working. The walls are paper thin and we heard every sound that came from the room next to us, (talking, television). Likewise, our neighbors heard every sound from our room as when our daughter had a nightmare one night and was crying out loudly, the neighbouring room let us know about it the next morning. I had a problem with the \"resort fee\" as we emailed ahead to ask if the use of the pool was included in our hotel charge, which we had paid already. We were informed that it was so the $12.00 a day that we had to pay once we got there was unexpected. When asked for further clarification about the fee I was told that it also covered the use of the in-room safe, the fridge, the microwave, shuttles to Disney, and a coupon for a discount on a cabana at the waterpark. This seems a little silly to me because when informed that I was not using the shuttles (because of the aformentioned inconvenient schedule), did not intend to use the waterpark because our days were planned for the theme parks (of which we had passes to Disney's waterparks) and therefore would also not require a cabana, and asked what they intended to do if I chose not to pay the fee, they told me it was not optional, that I had to pay it! I must mention that I did not cause any fuss but inquired quietly, what I feel is respectfully and usually not in front of a group of people. I did observe other guests in quite heated disputes with reception staff and I must say that in most cases it would appear as though guests opinions and feelings were not respected. On the morning of my check out I saw one gentleman disputing the \"resort fee\" charges and he was basically told to go away and shut up. He demanded to speak with a manager and was told, by another staff than the one standing there when I came upon the scene, that he could not. He told them he was prepared to wait and was once again told to go away as it would be of no benefit to speak with the manager, that the fee would be charged either way. I should mention that was the worst example I saw, but there were several other examples of staff being quite disrespectful to guests. I would never stay here again, even if it were free.

We were in the area to visit disney world. I am a regular Tripadvisor reviewer and customer and I always use trip advisor to help me in selecting my hotels. We booked this trip through expedia and we paid appox $65 per night (an estimate, as it was a packaged deal.) this was one of the few times that I somewhat ignored some of the reviews given by fellow trip advisors, part of the reson for this is that I was impressed that the hotel management had responded to most of the negative reviews on this website. I realize now that this seems to be the speciality of the hotel management team, as I seen it performed live with multiple hotel guests and again with my family. one of the concerns that I had before checking into the resort was that several trip advisor members stated that they were charged additional \"resort fees\" once they arrived at the hotel. so I emailed the hotel before my arrival to check it out. the reply I got from izzy fintz the hotels vp of hospitality was: \"The price of all our amenities is included with your stay for the price for the room plus resort fee plus tax.We look forward to your stay you will have a great time.\"(cut and pasted from the email) I thougt this was a little vauge but I assumed that the fees I had already paid to expedia would have covered this just like all the other items I booked (airline tickets, car) however when I arrived at the hotel, I was told no, that this was an additional charge that I would have to pay ($12 per night plus taxes) this cost would cover our use of the waterpark, plus kids craft area, entertainment and in room amenities such as a small refrigirator and microwave. In the end i had to pay this, as I had already paid for my room via expedia and if I went to another hotel I would have lost the money already paid. to me this is like paying for a airline flight in full and then showing up ready to board and having to pay a airport tax or something, on both check in and check out I witnessed several people arguing this with hotel staff and management, which is a good indication that something is un-just here. Moving on here's the rest of my review: Location : the resort is not in a great area I am a runner and I prefer to run outdoors but I was limited as I would not run in this area in anything less than full daylight. ( and I'm a 6'4\" fairly large man),also it is a minumum 30 minute (on average more like 45 min) drive to any part of disney world. my gps system shows the distance being 16 miles but it is through allot of traffic to get to disney, this just seemed to add fustration to the beginning and end of our days. The hotel appearance: it is motel style with exterior hallways, which raises concerns of safety, security, and also easy access for bugs ect... it is obviously a older hotel with a fresh coat of paint, I found the exterior hallways very dirty, with debris from wind and rain, but also some cigarrete butts (not the hotels fault as there is alot of well placed recepticles for the butts, just people don't seem to use them. The Room was well furnished and the furniture was in good shape. The carpet in our room was completely gross, very dirty with lots of stains. the sink area and bathroom tiles were nice, and modern. a huge problem with this room was that the walls are very \"thin\" you can here every thing (including people snoring in adjecent rooms) I had to have the bathroom fan on and the air conditioner fan on high to drown out the noise so I could get the kids to sleep. also, the bathroom always smelled like smoke, no matter what, and neither me nor my wife smoke so it was hard to shower as the smell was very strong. also the television signal was very por and often blurry. However the wi-Fi internet worked really well. The water park: Very nice, although we only used it once for about an hour (we had passes for disneys waterparks) the water park was well staffed and seemed to be a big hit with many other guests. Housekeeping: terrible, Our room was vacuumed once in 11 days and that was only after I asked Nina at the front desk to have the room fully serviced. the only time the tiled area around the bathroom and sink area was cleaned was by myself or my wife, as the maid never did it. whenever we ran out of shampoo I had to go to the front desk or find housekeeping staff in the hallway to get some as the maid never left any. when I was doing my final check of the room when we were getting ready to leave, I found lots of garbage behind the beds and under furniture that was not from us. during our stay we also spent time cleaning the walls in our room where previous guests had killed bugs against the wall and neither they nor the housekeepers had cleaned the wall after.Also we never got face cloths, ever, which we ended up just going to target and buying some. Hotel Management: When talking to the the front desk staff, I found them to be for the most part very nice. However thay have obviously had alot of experience at taking complaints as they were very well rehearsed in their reponses to my or my wifes complaints. However we are not very aggressive people by nature so we were not as adamant as some guests as to getting resolve to our complaints, I witnessed some of the front desk staff/ management be very rude and extermly un-professional towards at least 2 diffrent customers who were asking to speak to upper management to get there problems resolved. When I made complaint about our room not being properly cleaned the lady at the front desk (Nina) called housekeeping right away to have it done (however they still did a very poor job). When my wife asked about the \"continental breakfast\" the front desk staff demanded we produce our booking info that stated it was included in our package. (we found it, and we ate the continental buffet for the last 4 days, only after paying for our first 7 days not realizing that it was included) The Resturant staff indicated to us that this is common and that it is something that the front desk often does. The Resturant: Was good, the staff very nice and the food was average for a hotel resturant. the hotel advertises a seattle's best coffee service, but don't get your hopes up for a great latte, most of the items were \"unavailable\" during our entire stay. In conclusion, I would not stay here again for several reasons including: the attitude of the management ,the distance from the theme parks, the overall condition of the hotel, and the house keeping. The \"resort fee\" is an issue I intend to bring up with the clarion group and also expedia, as I feel it is very mis-leading and fraudulant. it's tough when you spend a large amont of money to take your kids to \"the happiest place on earth\" and you find yourself driving by other hotels that are closer to disney and much nicer in apperance and in much nicer areas and wishing you were staying there.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cFun,Relaxing & Enjoyable!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Caregivers", "ReviewID": "UR18264234", "Content": "We visited for just one night to be closer to the airport, thought they had free transportation to airport but did not.

I came acrossed Clarion Resort and Waterpark by doing a search for \"Orlando family friendly weekend trips\". The pictures were great, our 8 year old son was excited, we could have a nice relaxing 4 day weekend and not even have to leave the hotel (unless we wanted). I read all of the reviews and did my research. We were prepared for all of the pitfalls other guests had encountered (poor customer service, drive was far, hotel room not ready at check-in). Right off the bat, the 1st person I talked to at the hotel was an unfriendly girl with an extremely thick English accent. I opted to make my reservation online when I just couldn't understand her. Check-in time STARTS at 4pm - seriously, the housekeeping staff was cleaning rooms at ALL hours of the day and night. I think they are highly understaffed in this department. Although our room was fairly clean, it could have been cleaner. We paid for a waterpark view and the only view we had was the back of a blue tent structure. No other rooms (with a jacuzzi) were available when I attempted to change to a true waterpark view. The beds was very comfortable. The ceiling fan was nice. Although the hotel was recently \"completely\" renovated, it still screams 1970's. Now, the waterpark - the only reason we chose this hotel - we did have a good time. It wasn't the BLAST that I expected. We actually enjoyed the lazy river the most. But, all of the pictures were rather deceiving. This waterpark appeared much bigger online. It's pretty much 2 twisting slides, 1 normal slide and a lazy river (plus the normal pool and the toddler section). Our son didn't care for the slides because he said they hurt his back and they wouldn't let you keep a shirt on. The slides didn't open until 10am or later and closed at 7pm. We forgot to factor in the weather for this trip. They had to close down the waterpark at least 10 times while we were there because of lightning and thunder or \"bad weather\". It would be closed until the weather got better and then they'd announce it was re-opened. Most of the time we'd order a pizza (which was very good, sort of expensive and they add on 18% gratuity automatically) and go to the room, shower and go check out places we wanted to go. Probably our biggest issue was that the hotel was very far away from the major stuff. I believe they claim the hotel is 15 minutes from Disney (maybe at 3am in a race car going 100mph with no traffic or stoplights). We use to live in Orlando so we were familiar with the area and traffic problems, but this hotel is on the Kissimmee/St Cloud line, so it's a good drive to anything. Overall, for the price, I'd say it was a successful trip. Although the $12 per day resort fee is a laugh if you ask me. I want to know the criteria for being classified a \"resort\". We probably won't stay there again because we could have accomplished the same idea in a normal swimming pool. So overall, Pros: nice bed, good pizza, relax by the waterpark. Cons: very busy, too far out. Two things before I leave - we got a HUGE kick out of the fact that the washers and dryers are in a breezeway - open to the world and there are signs posted - \"Wash at your own risk\". Comic relief. Basically, if you walked away, say goodbye to your clothes. This isn't an upscale place folks. And lastly, if you get anywhere near this hotel or in the area, you MUST eat at Garibaldi's Mexican Restaurant. We had eaten at the \"sister\" restaurant in Orlando, but the one in Kissimmee is UNBELIEVABLY GREAT! The food was fantastic and the mariachi band was out of this world. We ate there Friday and Saturday night, yep, it was THAT good!

As we got in on July 1st after 8:00 PM , we really did not use the Waterpark that night. We got up Weds. morning, had breakfast, and proceeded to enjoy a wonderful day at the Water Park. Went to bed that night, got up Thursday morning, and thats when this vacation started to take a big turn for the worse. As this was the 4th of July weekend, it was a big travel weekend and the Hotel was full. As I came to find out there was a family reunion booked at the Hotel for this weekend. I would estimate this family to be 75 to 100 strong including children. This family completely took over the Water Park and the other activity centers. The vast majority of the adults spent the weekend in a falling down drunk state. The kids were left unchecked to run rampant through the water park, throwing water tubes, goggles, and anything else they could get there hands on at anyone and everyone. At the pools there were anywhere from 4 to 5 life guards about college age who did absolutely nothing to put a stop to this. By Saturday morning, my son no longer even wanted to leave the Hotel room. I told him that by the end of Sunday, this would get better as these people would be leaving, but we could move to another Hotel if he would like. He decided he wanted to stick it out. But we lost 3 days of our vacation due to this unruly behavior, that was allowed to go on unchecked. As for the Hotel itself, it is as has been mentioned in other reviews a very noisy place to stay, and you can hear footsteps, banging noise's etc.... all through the night. So I would considor bringing something to create some white noise. I would also avoid the hotel giftshop- store. None of the items have price tags on them, so when you go to purchase something, you get a big suprise! And if you ask them how much it is before buying something, they will give you a inflated price, if you tell them it is to much, they then will dicker with you on the price. Just not what you would expect from a store in this Chains high end Hotel. Also beware that on any purchase you make from the Hotel restaurants bar, there is a automatic 18% gratuity added to the bill. Also beware that the Waterpark is not just for hotel guests only. They sell day passes to the public to also use this, so it could become quite crowded. As for the food the hotel restaurants serve, I found it to be okay, and the staff friendly and competent.

However, when I arrived at the hotel, I was disappointed to see that the hotel was not in the nicest area. I was concerned for the safety of myself and my family. We got to the room and just decided to stay in for the evening instead of checking out the ammenities. In the room, there was about an inch gap from the door jamb to the bottom of the door, which let in light, heat and God only knows what kind of critters. We had to roll up towels and stick the in front of the door to cover the huge gap. The room took forever to cool down after that, due to all the heat entering and cold air escaping. My youngest used the restroom and the toliet backed up. My husband called the front desk and they said they would send maintenance right up however, they didn't show up at all. We were getting impatient, as I wanted to take a shower after walking the theme parks all day and my other child needed to use the restroom. In fact, while we were waiting, we ordered a pizza, got the pizza, ate the pizza and made a pillow fort for our kids. So my husband called the front desk again and asked if someone would just bring him a plunger and he'd do it himself. Finally, about 30 minutes after that the maintenance person showed up and the guy wiggled the handle a little, and said, \"Yeah, uh, I can't get the water to go down\" and left, wearing his gloves on the way out, touching our surfaces and door handles. So we had a stopped up toliet for our entire stay. Also, when we pulled out the sofa bed, there were wrist-bands, toys and crumbs ON the sheets, as if the sheets had not been changed in between stays. The exterior of the hotel looked run-down, but the inside was very nice. I enjoyed the room itself, aside from unchanged sheets and plumbing issues. They upgraded us to a suite when we got there for some reason, it had bunk beds which was great for the kids, a full-size refrigerator, microwave, and best of all, a private second bedroom with a private balcony. We started to let the kids sleep in the bunk beds, but shortly after we put them to bed I got so worried due to the fact that I didn't feel they were safe that close to the front door and windows, that I went and got them and put them in the bed next to ours in the back bedroom. In the morning we took the kids to the waterpark and they had a blast. They were both too small for the big slides (they are both 3), but they had fun in the children's area. They didn't want to leave to go to Sea World.

I like that they had a refrigerator to store water bottles and snacks. The boys just wanted to go to the big slides so we went down to the water park to let them play. You have to wear a wrist bands to get in there, I guess it\u2019s good because it is secure and not just anyone can get in. My husband and I sat around the out door bar & grill under an umbrella table while they played all day. The next mourning we ate the breakfast buffet in the restaurant and went to Disney\u2019s Magic kingdom. After about 3 pm the kids were tired and very hot so we went back to the hotel. When we got there the kid ran and got in to their swim suit and went right back to the water slides. All in all this is a great place to stay if you\u2019re on a budget because it\u2019s not just a pool it is a water park with lots of things to do for the kids.

I said I specifically called to check on this as I was going on line to get another room. Finally after about 45 minutes we got a suite that I had to pay extra for. The staff did try to accomodate us but I felt since I called it should have been more. Also they gave us the keys to the wrong room and so for the second time we were moved. Then they took us to another room and in this room the furniture was still in plastic and they wanted to move us to the frist toom we had this would have been the third move. After finally getting all settled in we still had trouble. The hotel staff not once but twice walked into our rooom without knocking. I did inform the front desk about this. Also when it was time for the bill it took about another 45 minutes because they had different prices for us. Also when we went to breakfeast it was supposed to be half price and children free. We were charged full price and also for the 4 year old. Our waitress did not even come back to see if we needed anything else to drink, she was not the best and to top it off they added an 18% tip to our biill. I felt if she was a better waitress i would not mind giving her the tip she deserved, and I expect better service than what I recieved. there were things on the menu that the whole week we were there that they did not have.

One of the nice things about the hotel location was that it is right off the main highway in the residential part of Orlando. It only took us about 23 minutes to get to Disney- so what we are on vacation, it was less time from the Clarion than if we would have stayed on Disney property and waited for the Disney bus that goes around to 3 or 4 stops. Upon arrival, our room was very clean and brightly decorated. We had a kid\u2019s suite with a bunk bed on the 3rd floor. The room also had a refrigerator and microwave, which we liked. Real Nice LCD TV with lots of channels. The beds are better than what we have at home lots of pillows. Right outside our room was a pool with a nicely size water park, big slides and lazy river all with in a courtyard. our room was always cleaned each day. YOU DON'T EVER HAVE TO LEAVE THE RESORT- THIS SAVED ALL US FROM GOING TO WET N' WILD. The slides were wild and the kids were having fun in the water park the whole day. We just laid in the lazy river on a tube. If you have kids and want somebody to entertain them all day they have an activity director, which included games, crafts and even bingo. All of the Lifeguards were friendly. The frozen margaritas at the pool bar were only $5.00 and they had a BBQ going by the pool so it was like a big party. The sad part was the ice cream shop was closed it looks like they are remodeling it but they sold ice cream and snacks in the gift shop.

The property is right on a busy roadway so you can expect road noise but this place was beyond noisy! They need to put up trees or some other barrier to tone it down! Finally there was a guest staying there that was allowed to walk around the grounds shouting, talk to himself loudly, throw drinks around the hallway etc. The police had to be called.

The Cleanliness of the room in general, carpet, smell, and A/C were great. The beds were made up with military precision, crisp, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was hospital-clean, and the shower was awesome. I was greeted by the Houskeeping Supervisor as I was preparing to check out, and she was also very professional and asked me if everything was okay.

While the other hotels jacked up prices to even *start* in the 300s, I appreciated this cost. You might think that it was because this was a much inferior hotel, but all considered it was simply a basic, but clean, no-frills place to spend a night. Some minuses include no control over thermostat (but it was comfortable enough given outside was pretty chilly!), older bathroom fixtures, a manual elevator/lift ( but someone was there at 11:00 to bring me up, so it was not an issue.) And as far as courtesy hoes, I interacted with probably 3 or 4 front desk staff, and I think they were perfectly fine... and a few quite friendly. My overall impression was that they are probably trying hard to build up their reputation. The lobby was quite nice and welcoming. I got there at noon and the room wasn't ready yet, but they happily offered to tag and store my bags with no problem at all. There wasn't an opportunity to give 1/2 stars, otherwise for the price I may have given it an overall 3.5. Bit again, don't expect luxury!

Staff were more than helpful in every way, made me feel very safe and at home, gave great directions, loaned me a umbrella from my night out on broadway, helped organize me a ride to the airport when mine didn't turn up. Excellent location, so close to everything, great restaurants, subway, did I mention just great. The only problem I had was when I purchased a ticked on the double decker tour bus, it didn't have a stop within quite a distance to the motel, but I just grabbed a taxi and it only cost around $12 (obviously nothing to do with the motel). I was on the 2nd floor which was also on the street, I thought I may have had a problem sleeping with the road noise, but not at all, the price of my room was unbelievable considering the location and quality of the room.

I was glad to have found the Hotel Deauville (they charged regular rates) through TripAdvisor although a bit nervous about our stay given the mixed reviews. Excellent location with the subway around the corner and Grand Central a few blocks away. We had breakfast every morning at Bread and Butter across the street which offers plenty of variety from a buffet to made to order omelettes, pancakes etc. Great, lively neighbourhood with plenty of reasonably priced restaurants along Lexington and 2 Avenue. We stayed in a double room on the second floor with a private bathroom. We requested a second floor room so that we didn't have to use the elevator. Our room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. As the hotel was once a dumbbell tenement, both the bedroom and bathroom windows faced a wall which was fine with us as it was quiet and were only there to sleep and shower. Rooms don't have alarm clocks. Free wifi is available throughout the hotel. Our bathroom was small with the shower located in the centre of the tub rather than one end. The hot water dial gets extremely hot and my friend burned herself on the tap. Although towels were replaced daily, the bathroom was not cleaned during our 4 day stay. Staff was extremely friendly but customer service is average. For example, if you want to make reservations (dinner, shows, airport pickup etc.), you will need to make them yourself. This was not an issue for us as we are independent travellers and I'm very familiar with the city but may be frustrating for other guests. Management may want to reconsider its current policy of not allowing guests to split the bill between two credit cards as its rather inconvenient.

The window faced the building next door since it was an interior room however that was great for us because we slept soundly not hearing any of the street noise (although the AC unit was a little loud but we got used to it). The bed was also comfortable and the AC worked well which was a relief because it was very hot the weekend we were there. There was even a new flatscreen TV on the wall.

The lobby area is nice with comfortable furniture for sitting around and planning your day. A small upright piano adds character and charm.

I am very puzzled that this hotel got overall positive feedback. I just stayed here for four nights while in New York. I paid $219 for a suite, which is a great deal for this city. They can keep the rates low because it doesn't have amenities such as a restaurant, fitness center or business center. The location on Park and 29th is a few blocks from the train; there are lots of restaurants in the area and a Starbucks across the street. The place is very old and has not been renovated or updated in a long time. This in itself would not have bothered me. I inspected the living room first. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that the sofa was absolutely filthy. There was dirt and stains all over it, and I had to put a blanket on it in order to feel OK sitting on it. Then I checked out the bedroom. The bed had no headboard, which I thought was odd and very cheesy (plus that makes it almost impossible to read in bed), and there was no alarm clock. I pulled back the bedspread/quilt, and that too was filthy, with a huge stain on the underside. It was also very torn. I immediately removed it from the bed. If something that dirty is on the bed, you wonder what else is dirty and what is being ignored. The sheets looked clean, which was a relief. The mattress was firm. The lighting was on the dim side. The towels were small and thin, what you'd expect to find in a Motel 6. The suites have a kitchen area along one wall with a microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge and sink. The bedroom had a window AC, which was very loud; I had to sleep with it off in order to get any sleep. Luckily I am not a big fan of air conditioning anyway. The living room didn't have an AC, but it did have a ceiling fan. Also, because of the building's age, it has the type of radiator where the management has to send up the heat, and there didn't seem to be any way for you to control it yourself. I imagine this would be a problem in the winter, because whenever I have stayed at a place with that type of heat, it is never enough and I am always cold. The hotel doesn't have a public computer. I had to go to the library to check my e-mail. The front desk did print out my airline boarding passes though. On the plus side, the staff is very nice and accommodating. The bathroom sink was leaking and they sent someone up to fix it. There was a bulb missing from the bathroom and they sent one up right away.

The shower took a while to heat up, but we just left it running before we got in and there was plenty of hot water when it finally kicked in.

This was the first time that I stayed at the Hotel Deauville, and I found the previous reviews that I had read to be pleasantly true--the hotel really is clean and charming, and the staff is adorable, and very helpful. The room was basic, but who goes to NY to sit in a hotel room? The room had two double beds, of perfectly adequate comfort, a sparklingly clean bath with lots of hot water, and a flat-screen TV. It was quiet, and the location is excellent! I highly recommend the Hotel Deauville for people who would like to visit the city more often, if only they could find reasonable accommodations. The Hotel Deauville fits the bill. I will be going back in a few months, and I'll bring my friends with me. It's almost like having a little pied-a-terre without the maintenance.

There was an attendant, one 6 yr old child and six adults total on the elevator. The maximum weight load stated on the wall was 1800 lbs. We did not reach the maximum nor did we come close. To make a long story short. Our elevator got stuck, then crashed two floors and wedged between the bottom two floors trapping us inside. The air was getting thick before we managed to wedge something into a hole in the top and were dragged out by our arms. We were hot, filthy, scared hurt and exposed. In the drop my foot turned and was stepped on giving me a sprain. For 7 days I hobbled around NYC in pain. Not only did Hotel Deauville not comp or refund our rooms they treated us badly. I was told their insurance company does not compensate for pain. All they did was cover my out of pocket expense after my own insurance company forked out the money. ( actually this happened in July 2008 and I have yet to receive that check, still waiting) I was told that in no way was Hotel Deauville responsible for what happened! In addition we were told by that elevator attendant, that this is not the first time an accident has happened in that elevator.

While the street facing rooms a a bit louder they have a bit of a view. The rooms facing the back are a bit darker but more quite. I truly recommend that you ask for a room facing the street if noise does not bother you. The room got cleaned on a daily basis and towels also got changed daily. There was a fridge (very quiet), hairdryer, soap and shampoo (everything you would also get in a 5* Hotel). The bed was soft and comfortable.

The five flights of stairs are easy to handle, even after 12 hours walking in the city. The Hotel is in a great location and we went on foot most times. The subway is just a minute away and even a cab to most places in downtown and/or uptown is only about 10-15 US$.

Room rather small, but considering it didn't have a bathroom, we had enough space for a bags etc 3. Room was serviced each day with fresh towels 4. Shared bathroom was cleaned daily 5. Friendly staff, willing to answer our questions 6. Convenient location - we were able to walk to many places. subway etc. Con's 1. Whilst the hotel is rather old and I did admire the charm of an 'staff operator' working the lift, but, after 5 days, I felt as though they were getting a tad annoyed with us, especially as we did not offer tips for every single ride! 2. Location is good, however, late on a few evenings we saw a few rather suspicious looking people hanging around the area. Needless to say, we did not encounter any problems. 3. The lock on our room door did not seem to be all that secure, so we took our passports and valuables with us each day. 4. Our non bathroom room on level 3 offered no view (not that we cared) however, the air con was rather noisy. Overall, would recommend the shared bathroom option for anyone looking to save $$ in NYC.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "merseyside uk", "Title": "\u201creally nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "oddsocksMerseysideUk", "ReviewID": "UR16917909", "Content": "My sister-in-law and i just stayed at the hotel deauville for 4 nights.

After hours of searching a travel agent proposed this hotel to us. We booked directly with the hotel as it is cheaper. Our flight arrived into JFK early and we arrived to the hotel shy of 1pm. Check in time is 3pm but we were in our room for 1:15pm. The lady on front desk gave us a subway map and explained us how it worked and told us how we could get to Yankee stadium the next day. They provide you with a safety deposit box which we took advantage of -- this is free of charge. They have wireless available for all floors -- again, free of charge and reliable. I requested a kettle for our stay -- this was sorted as soon as arrived - but no tea/coffee/milk packets.... to be honest I think this is pretty standard over here. They [Yanks in general] don't know what a 'white coffee' is so I didn't mind this at all. The fact that they fulfilled my 'special request' was great. Rooms are clean and are fairly well maintained - i.e. the bed and cushions feel like new and are very nice. After reading other reviews just in general about NYC hotels I was worried about space issues within the room.... this was not a problem as there was enough space for our 3 suitcases and then more as we had a 'storage room'. We also twin double beds..... bonus. Hotel is staffed at all hours and all the staff are very friendly and will bend over backwards to help you out. I.e. I asked reception at 10pm at night if they knew where might sell a travel adaptor and he handed me one right then. Quality service! The lift is very old fashioned (but looks cool)..... in the sense that a member of staff has to operate it. Every time we come into the hotel we use the lift as we were on the 6th floor (you feel near dead after using stairs....) and it's always manned with somebody. House keeping staff are great -- whilst I haven't actually met them, we are 2 21yr old guys and our room hasn't been the tidiest for the trip (no its not a dump, just a bit disorganized at times). We went on a shopping spree one day and between the both of us we had around 4-5 large boxes (from electronics goods), a few beer bottles and loads of other waste.... the bin was pretty much over flowing too. We came back into the room and it was all gone, and the teddy my friend bought was at the top of the bed near the pillow....I thought it was a nice touch. As a tourist I would say this hotel is in a GREAT location. Fair enough, it's not in smack middle of Times Square, but who the heck wants to be there anyway? Imagine the the number of subway transfers alone! It's on 29th street and there are subway stops for the GREEN SIX line about 1-2 blocks away. For you folks that don't know, the green line is a 'key' subway line and will take you to popular places such as Grand Central (great for transfers), Union Square, Canal St (China town), Brooklyn Bridge.... and so on, you get the idea. Empire state is about 10-15mins walk if that; you can easily walk to the local sights. There is a subway/ MC D's (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into that sort of stuff) but various other 24 hr establishments near the hotel. You will never go hungry over here. The neighborhood is safe - I've walked around at midnight with a $500 camera around my neck with no issues. I think most of Manhattan is safe..... we walked 15+ blocks after 11pm and there is always loads of people around, shops open, and a cop car every few blocks. People who say NYC isn't safe need to take their blind fold off and wake up and smell the coffee. We stayed towards the side/back of the hotel so the street noise was very minimum. With the windows open you can hear the sirens though as there is a fire station near by...... solution? Close the windows and you'll get a great night sleep like we have done. If you are looking for five star service from a hotel then do not come here. They will help you out as much as possible but there is no room service etc.... However if you are looking for a cheap safe stay in NYC, come here, it's great - sure, you don't get a view from the window in the room, but honestly, do you really care? You're in NYC, who spends time in their room other than for sleeping in. I will certainly be coming back to NYC in the near future and staying here again. Check my pics for the rooms/bathroom. If you need anymore info please do contact me - I don't mind answering any queries... Couple of tips for NYC: -Subway is a great way of getting around the city but watch out for downtime and uptown sides. Some stations will have them on the same platform, others you have to walk to the other side of the street. It normally says on the subway sign, if not, presume it serves both within the same location. Watch out for 'express' and 'local' trains. Express trains skip certain stops and local stop on all stops. -Never pay the asking price in China town, always barter with them! -Have breakfast & coffee at Guy& something (sorry can't remember the last bit) -- it's a nice coffee shop 2 blocks to the right of the hotel. Great coffee! -Do empire of state at night as less queues and top of the rock during the day so you can see central park. -Don't be afraid to ask locals for help and advice if you're lost - if they can, they will help. I found the local people to be very friendly ; I had various people ask me while standing at the road waiting to cross if I was having a good time in NYC (I was going through my guide book so I must of stood out as a tourist) Loads of other stuff too but way too many to list here...... just enjoy your trip.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon, England", "Title": "\u201cThey sold our room!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Iandevon", "ReviewID": "UR13376758", "Content": "After traveling over 20 hours and then arriving to be told in an albeit friendly way that our room had been sold deserves only one star I'm afraid.

If you are on a romantic trip, I would say no to this one, but I was with a girlfriend and we managed fine... and got over it and I probably would return to the Deauville as it was clean enough...and gave me more money in my pocket to go shopping!

There was a very large cupboard in which to store all our luggage and purchases. The Kitchenette was brill we were able to have tea/coffee in the mornings and used the fridge to store our alcohol ( had a drink before we went out in the evenings - whilst we all queued for the Bathroom !!). The staff at this hotel were fab - very helpful, gave great tips and were interested in your day. They stored our luggage for us on the day of departure - silly us we left one bag behind - after a short panick on the flight I called when we arrived back in the UK and was told that the bag was save and sound ( lucky for me My sister was still there on her NY break so she was able to collect the bag a bring it home for me) but they were prepared to mail or fed-ex it to me if it was needed. I am going back to NY in March ( doing the east and west coast this time) and will stay at this hotel again this time with my Husband and 11yr old son. The location is great and nice places to eat nearby one block from the metro..... what more can i say.

I was a little nervous about what it would be like, having read unfavourable reviews of others hotels in New York. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised to find it clean and comfortable. Our room had one double bed, hanging space with hangers, tv, bedside tables, chest of drawers and towels provided. As budget travellers, we opted for a shared bathroom, and were pleased to find a sink in our room. The bathroom was next door and also spotlessly clean. We had a daily housekeeping service and heard vacuuming every day. The Deauville is also in an excellent location (walking distance to Empire State Building and Times Square) and I felt safe in the area at night. The only small thing that was wrong was that our room got quite warm and the air-con very loud so we couldn't have it on at night; and the window faced a brick wall, about 2-3 feet away. Being on the third floor this meant practically no natural light reached the room. However, for some people this may be a plus! It also made the room quieter than I expected for New York. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Deauville: it is fairly basic but good value for money and most importantly, clean. The staff were pleasant and I would definitely stay there again. It is not the kind of hotel you'd spend a lot of time in, but who's going to stay indoors when on holiday in New York anyway!", "Date": "October 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGood value, basic accomodation\u201d", "Author": "T0ffee_Girl", "ReviewID": "UR5899409", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights from 25th September 2006. We chose the hotel from an online booking site because we wanted something fairly central but inexpensive. This hotel delivered that. If you are wanting something, modern, slick with lots of facilities, then don't book the Deauville - you will be better suited by one of the many pricier hotels in Manhattan. However, if you want a hotel that is handily located, inexpensive but clean and friendly, then this fits the bill. Our trip to the USA included a visit to a friend in PA, so we arrived at the Deauville in the afternoon of 25th having driven our hire car back to JFK. We got a yellow cab to the hotel for a fixed fee of $45 and that was a good and effortless way to get to the hotel. They checked us in immediately and efficiently with our internet booking voucher. Our room was on the 6th floor (a quaint lift is available for those not too keen on stairs). The room had 2 queen beds and was clean and tidy. It had ample hanging and storage space and a decent sized bathroom. My only slight complaint would be that the room smelled smokey but this didn't bother me too much and i didn't mention it to the staff so i can't comment on how they might have dealt with it if i had. The staff were very friendly and helpful and i generally felt very safe in the area (common sense must be used of course). The lady on reception was happy to offer advice on how to find places - we had booked an open top bus tour and wanted to find the departure point and the lady offered to write down bus routes and/or subway instructions for us if needed (though we actually decided to walk to it on the end as walking is very easy in Manhattan). She also booked a car for us for our return to JFK. The hotel is situated between Lexington and Park Avenues on East 29th Street. The walk to the ticket office for the the bus tour was about 45 minutes but very pleasant as you crossed all the main avenues and a selection of the central streets (seeing many of the famous sites on the way). Getting around is very easy in Manhattan (especially if you have a good map of the blocks) - its almost impossible to get lost. For those travelling for a short sightseeing trip, i would certainly recommend the 48 hour 4 loops bus tour. I know its a bit cheesy but it gets you about the island and the guides are very informative. We had a great time in NY and found that the Deauville met our needs which, as i said, were for a low cost basic, but clean friendly and comfortable hotel. We literally only slept there - if you intend to spend more time in your hotel, perhaps its not for you. If anyone would like further info, i am happy to answer emails if/when i can. toffeegirl@tiscali.co.uk", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel ruined my trip to NY\u201d", "Author": "kthacher", "ReviewID": "UR5829739", "Content": "I arrived at this hotel at 4:00 in the afternoon after booking at least a month prior to the arrival time. They had sold our rooms to someone else. They offered some feeble explanation that went something like \"we don't overbook like other hotels, but we overbooked in this case\". Their offer of compensation was for some kind of deal the next time we were in NY. Real generous to offer something you know you will never need to deliver on. The city was very busy that day with a large UN meeting. My belief is that they simply sold our rooms to people who paid a higher rate. They had booked us into another nearby hotel that we walked over to with all of our luggage. Prior to the walk, I asked about the quality of the new hotel. They assured me it was fine, which was completely false. It was a total dump - you had to pay in advance through a plexiglass window, it was rundown, had one TV channel, carpet that covered up holes in the floor, etc. After we checked into the other hotel, I went back and confronted the sales manager about poor quality of the other hotel. She then admitted to me that she had never been inside, so she had lied when she assured me that it was a quality hotel. I travel extensively and have ran into overbooked situations many times before, but never this early in the day. Also, in other cases the offending hotel goes to great lengths to make sure that the alternate accomodation was acceptable. The fact that we were sent off to such a dump is an outrage in my opinion.

On the whole the rooms were clean and fresh sheets put on the beds each day. The decor was very drab and quite depressing, but managed to get a purple bath tub so was satisfied. Had a room facing a wall so found it quite weird not having any natural light for the week. Plenty of hot water each morning for 3 of us to all shower -we were worried about this after reading previous reviews. The hotel is well located - just off Park Avenue! The worst bit about our stay was buliders drilling and banging right above our room at 8.30 in the morning for 2 of the days we were there (and these were the days I was allowed a lay in) and there were some American teenagers staying at the end of the corridor who were very noisey slamming doors and shouting to each other in the early hours. On the whole it was a good stay - but perhaps not one to be repeated. If I went again I would like to pay extra and have some luxuries that a more expensive hotel has to offer.

Some of the rooms have a B&B style \"bath down the hall.\" The neighborhood is non-glamourous with a Central Asian feel, lots of curry and falafel nearby. Having said all this, the Deauville's about as good as it can be. The elevator is a time trip, although the operators weren't always glad to see you if you interrupted their nap time late at night. I was in rooms both with and without a bath and they were both fine, larger than expected with worn rugs and old furniture. The A/C was adequate on some very hot summer days.

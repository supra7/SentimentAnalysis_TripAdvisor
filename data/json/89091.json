I left my computer in the room (I know how could I do that?) and they had it for me when I called. I was thrilled and very greatful.

They have a fairly expensive breakfast buffet that is mediocre, and they also charge you extra for drinks including coffee. 3) Rooms are small, old and mine had an unpleasant odour to it. 4) I found 2 plug points in the whole room. I lived in darkness as I had to unplug their lamps to plug in my phone charger and laptop charger. In this day and age, not really acceptable for a hotel in this price range. 5) Bathroom was small, old and had plaster flaking all over the place. All in all, it wasn't a bad stay. However, at $180-$350 dollars per night, it just didn't make the mark. I have had equivalent if not better stays in budget and mid range hotels for a fraction of the cost.

The location is fairly good and I did enjoy the PB&J sandwiches. When I arrived at the hotel, I was impressed with the ornate lobby and courteous staff. The first room we were in was nice but as I was reading some brochures on the bed, a roach ran across the bedspread. At this point, I am thinking that this may be an isolated incident so I just dispose of the roach and continue reading. Later that night, as I pull the covers I notice a lot of \"stuff\" on the linens. Okay, this really bothers me. I can deal with some dirt and grime on the walls and even in the bathroom, but I have to have clean linens. Its really late and I don't feel like changing rooms. Fortunately, we got double beds. (My gf has the tendency of taking the entire bed. Even in a King, I always end up on the edge of the bed nearly falling off) I checked my gf's bed and it appears to be clean; since it is very late and we didn't feel like packing everything up, we decide to sleep in the clean bed (closest to the window). Although we didn't sleep well with the both of us in there, I think the beds would have been comfortable. So in the morning, I let the front desk know and that there was a roach in the room and the linens weren't clean. They were very understanding, apologized, and let me change rooms. Unfortunately, the second room we were in, had the same problem. It was odd that the bed closest to the door was always unclean while the one near the window was cleaner. I think our room was booked as non-refundable. I might have been able to talk to them and go to another hotel, but I'd rather spend my time exploring New Orleans than changing hotels. I would have given this hotel a 2.5 but I rounded up since the staff was excellent and even sent up wine, fruit, and other snacks as an apology for the inconvenience.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Gatos, CA", "Title": "\u201cOlder Elegant Hotel w/ Great Location right outside French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "Livewild", "ReviewID": "UR127954394", "Content": "We arrived very early in the morning at around 2am and we were promptly checked in. Our room was 721. The room was very elegant with dim lighting which set a very nice mood in the room. Our room had no real view. You looked across the street at the building next to the hotel. This was not an issue for us. The hotel had a very nice ambiance. We really enjoyed staying there. Room size: Adequate Bathroom: Small but updated nicely. Not much counter space. Bed: Very comfy. Pillows were extra high loft, non-allergenic, polyester fiberfill. I asked for soft feather pillows and they brought them to us within minutes of our request. Hotel restaurant: Did not eat there Hotel bar: Very nice. Has at least one nice chess set, if you, like to play Hotel terrace: Small dipping pool, hot tub and about six lounge chairs around the pool. Very small area. There is also a couple of cabanas with lounge chairs off to side away from pool and a few two top tables. It is a very relaxing area. We went up on a Friday night at 11pm and the terrace was all ours! Amazing! Noise level: Our room was across from ice maker closet and the guest in the adjoining room were very load (shouting, etc.) the first night. We turned down the air conditioner temp and turned up the fan and it seemed to drown out most of the noise. I would recommend bringing ear plugs. Location: We were there for the final four games and I think this hotel had one of the best locations! It was an easy walk to the Superdome and, trust me, traffic was hell even if you were trying to drive 4 blocks to the game. Being able to walk was a huge plus. The hotel is also only about a 5 minute walk to the edge of the French Quarter. Night time snack: PB&J sandwiches and hot cocoa severed at 10 pm in the lobby are a nice touch. Service: Staff was not overly friendly. This may bother some people but it did not bother us. If you are in New Orleans to party in the French Quarter this may not be the hotel for you but for our purpose it was great! We paid an average of $477.17 a night which is crazy however this was during the final four games and we booked last minute through Orbitz. This was a steal as other rooms where going well over $1k per night a few weeks earlier and on the day I booked there were no other hotels with rooms available in NOLA! I had been checking daily for hotels to open up so to get one for this price so late was awesome!

It is a beautiful old building, exquisitely decorated and full of class, character and charm. We found the location perfect for our purposes. It was within easy walking distance of the French Quarter and yet far enough away to ensure some peace and quiet in the wee hours of the morning. The service was friendly and our room was clean and comfortable. The free high speed internet was a bonus. Having said all that we would probably stay somewhere else if we visited New Orleans again. For one thing, the hotel offered more amenities than we really needed. Although the weather was very warm during the day (+78 F) we were too busy sight-seeing to spend much time in the roof top pool and hot tub. We were there one afternoon and frankly found the pool area a little messy and unclean. The water quality was poor in both the hot tub and pool. Another \"claim to fame\" is the evening hot chocolate and peanut butter sandwiches. Only once in the whole week did we make it back to the hotel in time for this nightly event and we were so stuffed from our evening meal that we couldn't eat a thing. One another minor complaint was the price of the morning breakfast in the hotel restaurant. We don't eat much for breakfast so we immediately ruled out the extremely expensive morning buffet. Instead we chose toast and coffee and still paid around $20 for two people. Needless to say, other mornings we found our way to some of the many nearby coffee shops and restaurants where you could have a decent breakfast for under $10. We didn't eat another meal in the hotel restaurant all week since there are so many high-quality, reasonably priced restaurants everywhere we went. We celebrated my birthday in a fabulous upscale restaurant called GW Fins that had excellent food and service. Anyway, Le Pavillon is a great hotel with all the charm and comfort you could want. I definitely recommend it.

We stayed for two nights mid-week with two kids in March. It would get a higher rating from me if the service was better, but my opinion overall of the hotel is that it used to be four stars, has lost much of its glory, but still has most of the trappings. The lobby is very formal, with grand chandeliers and beautiful antique furnishings. The rooms are decorated in what used to be beautiful window treatments and bedspreads, but now are just old looking, but with beautiful antique desk and chairs. The room and bathroom were clean. One of our beds had fabulous high thread count sheets, but the other had thread-bare sheets that barely covered the mattress. There were only two pillows (one per person) on each queen sized bed. Not a huge deal, but its the little extra touches (like lots of plump pillows) that make a hotel four star to me. That pretty much describes our stay- it was not bad, was not great, but had moments of both. We arrived at 9:30 pm to no doorman and a driveway full of parked cars. After walking in to the front desk to ask about a bellman to help with our bags, one apathetic staff member said \"he should be out there\". We waited in the street for about 20 minutes, then unloaded and self-parked. Finally making it into our room, we tried to order room service, which was open until midnight, but no one would answer the phone. Repeated calls to the front desk and housekeeping to bring more pillows (only two per queen size bed) went unanswered as well. We finally walked down to the lobby to ask for room service and housekeeping, and they called us back in our room shortly. Room service food was hot and delicious, though, and arrived quickly after we ordered. The very popular PPJ sandwiches and cocoa from 10-11 pm in the lobby was a really great touch, and a welcome fun treat. More service issues at the pool the next day, however. The pool itself is awesome. It is a small little jewel tucked up in a corner on a roof deck/garden with loungers surrounding. It offers a rooftop view of New Orleans and is high enough off the street to be a quiet retreat frim the noisy city. The deck is open until 1am, so the night view was pretty incredible!

Both of us slept exceptionally well. Unlike the hotels in the quarter, the halls here weren't busy with rowdy guests or randomly loud and noisy when elevators opened. I was disappointed about the small bathrooms; little counter space beside the sink and only a tub/shower. I had hoped for a bigger tub to take a bath in. There is a drawn bath menu, but I wouldn't even consider having a bath drawn in such a small tub that doesn't allow enough room for relaxing. This hotel is old and the bathroom reflects that. Oddly enough, our room included a large closet size.

My only negative comment is over the breakfast buffet. The dining room is magnificent, but my advice is to skip their breakfast and walk down the street to any of the wonderful New Orleans cafes. The buffet costs $20, yet it was just a mediocre quality breakfast (rubbery fruit, cheap bread, low quality cheese, dry pasteries, basic cereal, etc). To add insult to injury, one is charged five dollars extra for the coffee and orange juice. The waiter innocently asks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would you like coffee and juice?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the surprise comes when you sign for the bill.

Truly enthusiastic and engaged with us when we had any questions or concerns. The woman who checked us in and out was amused that we'd heard some of the ghost stories already and gave us a little packet of papers that gave some more detail of paranormal investigations of the hotel and its history. It was an interesting historical landmark. PB&J bar at night was cute as all get out. Encouraged some sense of traveller's community and the whipped cream for the hot cocoa was a nice touch. Doubtful: a four star rating on this hotel- the amenities were \"eh\" and the mini bar was a drag because although wwe did not use anything in it, we could also not use the refrigerator to store our goods without disturbing the $8 bottled water inside and momentarily incurring a bill- this was of course sorted out immediately by the truly charming and kind staff, however. Just worth noting that the mini-fridge is fully stocked and any disturbance to it is sensed and recorded, so if you even open it and breathe hard, you'd better go down to the front desk and let them know. The bathroom was well, kinda mildewy, rusty and musty. The humidity just stuck. Now, I do realize that we were in New Orleans, but truly, I was glad we chose December and not July because I can only imagine how humid the room would've been then...there were obviously past complaints regarding the cooling system as there were handprints and smudges all around the vent in the ceiling. Just looked sloppy. The carpet was fairly threadbare in high traffic areas, and no lie- there was crumbled up granola under the desk when we checked in, so it didn't seem like the room had really been cleaned well between us and whoever had been there before us. There were weird stains on one of the lampshades next to the bed...conjecture ensued...and then was disregarded, because really, we were there to enjoy ourselves and not nit-pick the place to death. So, we decided to enjoy ourselves. With some effort, but hey, you don't come to New Orleans to moan and complain- you come to have a good time, so while we did initially debate about asking for another room, we decided to just overlook some of the jankier parts of our room...our reasoning was that the rest of the rooms were probably in similar repair- weird wiring that had rolled out in stages, super dated and peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, marble flooring that was raised like an inch to step up into the bathroom from the bedroom...the hotel is over 100 years old, and we realized what that meant and just decided to not be distracted by it that much. It could use an organized renovation for sure, but that would easily take millions and millions of dollars. So, yeah, just know that and you won't be disappointed, you'll be realistically positioned in a pretty good hotel with an above average staff. The rest of the hotel was lovely. Really engaged my imagination and I could see how it must've been quite the grand hotel in its day. And as I said, the staff was great. No ghosties, but plently of fun making noises and playing around about it. 5 to 10 minute walk to the French Quarter and beyond. Close to the trolleys, though we never used one.

Also, buy a trolley pass for $3 (lets you ride all 3 lines, all day and nite, unlimited on/off stops). We also did the daytime Haunted City/Graveyard walking tour. It starts at Rev. Zombie's Voodoo Shop and takes you on a nice walk through the French Quarter.

Memorial Day weekend -- about 6 weeks later -- I started getting bitten and discovered bedbugs beginning to take root in my mattress. I had exterminators come in with a bedbug sniffing dog and the dog barked at the bed, my couch, dressers, and my luggage. Luggage I had not used since New Orleans and Le Pavillon. And luggage I had not used in ages prior. I can't say at all for certain that Le Pavillon was the source of the bedbugs, I won't make that claim at all. But the room we stayed in was dingy, dark and old. It smelled musty and felt dirty. And the time-line fits that this is where it happened. As a now savvy bedbug traveller, I would only suggest that anyone staying at Le Pavillon take precaution. One other thing to note: I called Le Pavillon to tell them what happened. The next day they asked me to send them the receipts for all of my expenses - I wound up spending about $2000 on esterminators, laundry, cleaning supplies, throwing away clothing, etc. I asked them if they'd found bed bugs, but they would neither confirm nor deny. Several days later, I got a call from their insurance agent who GRILLED me; I felt like I was being deposed. I guess it's a liability thing, but I never asked them for money, I only called to tell them what happened and ask them to check the room. If they had found bedbugs, then I would have asked them to pay my out of pocket costs. They sent their insurance agent after me and I wan't very happy about it. When I pressed them about bedbugs in the room, I was told that they did a \"visual inspection\" of my room - room 431 - and the adjoining rooms. Personally, I don't think a visual inspection is sufficient. And while the staff of Le Pavillon was fantastic, this experience has soured me on the hotel. Again, I have no direct proof that I got bedbugs from Le Pavillon, but travelers should take precautions.

I called the hotel to keep the staff updated on my progress, and was constantly assured that I could check in whenever I arrived, and that my resservation would not be cancelled, even though I was not checking in on the first night. When I arrived 22 hours late (again, USAir, I just can't say enough about YOU), the front desk had notes from my calls & made me welcome from \"hello\".

I was whisked through check-in, and taken to my beautiful room for a much-needed bit of rest. This is definitely a 4-star hotel. The room was gorgeous, the hallways and lobby were beautifully decorated, and the service was excellent. I had drinks in the bar one night, and they were not overpriced - the prices were comparable to any bar in New Orleans, and the polite and friendly service was more welcoming. The bartender even sent me back to my room with a bowlful of cajun snack mix - a nice touch. The view from my window was nothing to write home about - just the pizza parlor on the next block. The toilet paper was chintzy - one-ply in spots, two-ply in others (how is that even possible?). The hotel got much busier over the weekend, with the holiday & Essence, so the room price went sky-high for those two days. Those are the only negative things I can say about Le Pavillon.

For 15.00 one nite its all you can eat Lasagne with a side of string beans and salad. Comes with the dinner rolls and topped off with bread pudding. All very delicious. With food this good and at the special price we didnt have to go out to eat dinner. Food staff even went above and beyond by making a banana foster right there pan, flame and all and it was not on menu. I asked the concerige prior to dinner time where we could get a good banana foster close by. There was no place close . she picked up the phone and called food dept. She said they will do it for us . What service!! The hotel was very well airconditioned >>>too well, had to wear lightjackets even at din ner time as well as in the business center.

No regrets.\u201d", "Author": "LBoyer57", "ReviewID": "UR114660983", "Content": "I agonized over my booking at this hotel. It was my first experience using Hotwire, and I thought, \"How could I go wrong with 4.5 stars for $99\"? After finding out what hotel I got, I read the Trip Advisor reviews and got really scared. Hotwire is non-refundable, and I was reading about dirt and mold, possible bedbugs, and horrible threadbare linens. I wanted out! But I went. People, let me put your minds at ease. Le Pavillon is a charming, even (dare I say it) beautiful hotel. The service staff was wonderful. It was clean and comfortable. No, it is not a 4.5 star hotel. But it is hard to put this hotel into star categories. It is far beyond 3 stars. There is something unique about it that's very likable; perhaps it's the \"old world\" feeling people talk about, or the regal, over-the-top decor. For many reviewers the decor is a turn-off, and I acknowledge that it's not tasteful in any sleek, modern way. But if you have a little sense of humor and can handle a wee bit of kitsch, Le Pavillon is lovely. I took two 18-year-olds with me to New Orleans for Spring break, who have not travelled extensively (but both have at least been to Europe and New York City). When we walked into Le Pavillon's lobby they were wide-eyed and breathless. \"I've never seen anyplace so beautiful,\" said one of them. For me, that was worth it all. The downside is, as you will see in many of these reviews, that this hotel could really use new beds and new bedding. (The bed was comfortable and clean, but not luxurious.) For me, bedding is one of the most important things in a hotel room, and if Le Pavillon wants to keep and increase its business, it will have to make this investment in the near future. The baths could use a sprucing up as well. One thing we appreciated was that the hotel dining room offered a 3-course nightly dinner special for just $15 (approximately). Of course, in New Orleans you want to sample the city's many dining experiences, but on our first night we were tired from a long day of travel, and eating in the hotel was all we had energy for. It turned out to be one of our favorite meals. We got salad, main course, and dessert for the price; our waiter was very personable, and there was a fire in the fireplace (which was good in March). All in all, we enjoyed our stay at Le Pavillon very much. I did not find it to be dirty or moldy, and the bedding did not suck. We did not get any bedbug bites! It just may be a bit over-rated by Hotwire. After all my worries, by the way, Hotwire turned out to be a great deal. I wouldn't have enjoyed the hotel so much if I had paid much more for my room. (Just don't book this way if you want a refundable fee!)", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA very friendly place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "lthale", "ReviewID": "UR114608118", "Content": "My husband and I spent our 10th anniversary trip at Le Pavillon and were very pleased.

First, Hotwire lists this as a 4.5 star hotel, which is not accurate. No other website seems to list the hotel as 4.5 stars, and the hotel itself is nowhere near a 5 star hotel. However, I am not sure this is really the hotels fault. On arrival the front desk was very friendly. The lobby is beautiful and has old world charm. We were given a room on the 2nd floor - which I would advise against since all of the banquet rooms are also on this floor. The room itself was not really representative of the pictures we saw online. I would presume the deluxe guest rooms are better appointed - but this room really just felt a bit cheap. The furniture was not what I would call 4 star quality and while the hotel goes for an old world vibe - you don't actually want a room that looks like it hasn't been updated in the modern era either. The bathroom was the best part of the room however. The large walk in shower was really nice and had great water pressure. The bathroom had a marble sink and floor and was well appointed. The bathroom did have an elegant look to it. However, like other areas of the hotel - a few details seem to have been forgotten. There were paint chips on the door missing and some soap scum around the glass wall for the showers. Neither of these things are a huge problem - but once again, if the hotel was billing itself as 4 or 4.5 stars - are details that should not be missed. The pool area on the rooftop was also nice. It is contrary to other reviews, not the best rooftop pool in New Orleans. The W, the Westin and the Roosevelt all have better deck pools and there may be others too. However, when we tried to call for room service to bring a pitcher of beer to the rooftop, they seemed confused someone would order a pitcher of beer. Room service said they weren't sure they had pitchers but would figure something out. They eventually brought beer in a metal milk or juice pitcher and some Styrofoam cups. For this pitcher of beer they charged $36.00. Do NOT order a pitcher of beer! I've ordered pitchers of beer from rooftop pools in Miami and paid half of that with all of the delivery charges and tip included! I would recommend bringing your own drinks or waiting to drink later! Overall, the stay was good. The bed was soft and comfortable and the staff very friendly. While we're happy with the stay because of the price we got on Hotwire, I would have likely been a little upset had we paid the rack rate. The hotel does have charm and I believe some of the rooms are probably quite nice. I would recommend springing for the deluxe room if you do stay because if our room was typical of the standard room - you could do better in New Orleans. I've also noticed comments on the outrageous parking fees. There is a parking garage on the other side of Poydras & O'Keefe St. in a funky modern steel building that is $10.00 for 24/hrs. I strongly recommend just parking there and walking the 2 blocks to the hotel if you can.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cOld and out of date, but it does have chandeliers\u201d", "Author": "DoubleOJosh", "ReviewID": "UR114014910", "Content": "This hotel is very old, and apparently this means they can charge you enormous amounts for everything.

The only thing is the TV was a large tube rather than a flat panel. That could use some updating. When I was looking for hotels I initially chose one in the french quarter. Let me say that the location of this hotel is much much better. The french quarter/bourbon street is pretty rowdy at night and the location of Le Pavillon allows you to be away from that but within walking distance of the french quarter and its attractions.

This was our first time at the Le Pavillon, which we booked and got a great deal on through hotwire.com. When making our reservation we requested a king bed instead of a double and the hotel was very accommodating (other hotels will typically not make promises on requests, particularly if you book with a third party) My first impression of the hotel was that the outside is beautiful. The inside is equally as nice with its traditional decor. If you don't appreciate antique/traditional style they don't stay here! The pictures on the hotel webpage are true to life so if you are curious- look at the pictures. If you want modern and trendy stay at a chain hotel. We stayed on the 9th floor and I know that other reviewers have complained about that floor being in need of updating but we found the room to be clean, comfortable and spacious. The 9th floor was also in close proximity to the pool, which was really convenient. The staff at the hotel were exceptional. Our room was nicely cleaned each day. Anything you requested (we had forgotten a toothbrush) was promptly brought to the room. I also thought that I had lost my wallet while out and after calling the hotel, staff went to my room, checked for and found my wallet all while I was still on the phone. The late night pb and j's were a great snack. The bread was always fresh and everything was presented nicely. The location of the hotel is also convenient. It is a very short walk to the french quarter but removed from the noise. It is also a short walk to the St. Charles Street car so there is easy access to the Garden District as well. Harrah's casino is also within walking distance. After staying at the Le Pavillon I don't see the need to stay any where else in New Orleans. We will be returning soon!

The lobby is truly spectacular and the check in staff are professional and very helpful. We were quickly shown to our junior suite (large studio room), and settled in. The room was smallish but being an older hotel we were expecting this. The room was clean, as was the bathroom. However the bed was not great and the bed spread was very old and needed updating. The major problem with this room type is that it is directly behind the elevator and unfortunately the room is not insulated well and the noise was very loud. Most noise seemed to be coming in through the room's door which had a large gap at the bottom and around the edges. If proper seals were installed I'm sure the noise would be reduced. We were staying 4 nights so we asked if we could move to another room. Unfortunately all their junior suites are located behind the elevator shaft (the trade off for the slightly larger room). We also had difficulty with the hot water in the bathroom, it was either cold or scalding hot. As we required the extra room space due to work requirements, we decided to give the room a go for another night, rather than accepting a discounted upgrade to a full suite. We found putting pillows against the bottom of the door helped to reduce the noise! However the next morning there was no hot water. So we accepted the discounted upgrade for the remaining two nights of our stay. I must say the staff member I spoke to about our room issues was very understanding and professional and arranged for our luggage to be moved during the day whilst we were on a tour. This standard of service is what we loved about our stay at Le Pavillion. All staff we dealt with during our stay were first class and made you feel like you were very welcome and at home. The restaurant and bar areas were also brilliant. The Sunday jazz brunch is an absolute must, with high quality food and fabulous music. We were similarly impressed with dinner at the restaurant, with our server being well informed and very attentive. I cannot stress how wonderful the staff are at Le Pavillion and the restaurant, bar and lobby areas are first class luxury - you pay the extra to stay at a luxury hotel and these areas all deliver to the standard expected. However the rooms need improvement. Even the last two nights of our stay in the full suite were not without problems. The drapes on the bedroom window were broken and would not close, a light switch wouldn't work and the bathroom had no room for your toiletry bag even though it was a bigger room. Ultimately, the maintenance of the guest rooms is not good enough for a hotel that markets itself as a luxurious place to stay. The rest of the hotel is at a luxury standard, which is what was so frustrating about our stay. We loved the charm of the building, the spectacular common areas, the restaurant and the staff, but the rooms do not meet the same standard. I would recommend Le Pavillion to friends for a short 1 night stay so they could experience the restaurant and wonderful attentive staff, but until the rooms are improved I would not recommend a longer stay.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and outdated\u201d", "Author": "Clackman", "ReviewID": "UR104287931", "Content": "We stayed in a two-bedroom suite, with a sitting room between the bedrooms.

Our room was very nice, the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was nicely appointed, but small(old hotel). Problem with the bathroom also is the WATER. The water went from scalding hot to freezing cold about 10 times in a 10 minute shower, this is NOT luxury...we were on the 6th floor(not certain if that makes a difference). We enjoyed the rooftop pool/jacuzzi. There's no bar on top though, so your only option is to order from a phone and pay dearly for any drinks/food(gratuity+fee+food/drink)...for me, it would be more reasonable to outfit the top with a working bar. The rooftop must be walked up one flight, no elevator after the 9th. The gym is small but nice, it only had one elliptical, which someone hogged the entire 45mins. I did floor work...only after I was leaving did she ask \"oh, were you waiting on this?\", nope!

This was a splurge, to stay at such a highly regarded hotel, and I personally was disappointed. The historical value of being in a hotel you know some of the rich and famous have passed through was the best part of the experience. Looking at the chandeleurs, paintings, decor and realizing what actual art you were viewing was stepping back in time. I tried to consider that in feeling that in some ways I had to take into account the age of the hotel. It was definitely clean and the staff was amazingly friendly. No matter where we were, if staff was present they always spoke and made it very clear that they were there for us, if needed. I imagine some of the larger rooms and suites are probably exquisite. We stayed in a queen deluxe. We were told we were \"upgraded\" from a standard because they were out of standard queens when we checked in. If we were in a deluxe, I would hate to have stayed in the standard. The room was comfortable in size and the decor was true to the period of the hotel. The bed was so uncomfortable and hard. My hip hurt most of the night and neither of us had a good nights sleep. The bathroom was a comfortable size...and that's it. The shower head gave a horrible spray of water, from a ceramic head. I can't believe an adjustable spray head wouldn't be more prudent, not to mention it meant we had to shower that way - nothing to adjust to fix the spray. They have a nice rack for you to read a book, if you choose, in the tub. It was so rusty, I would think for a $300-plus room, they could afford a new one. The brass in the bathroom need polishing...bad. Walking the halls and going up to the rooftop pool was nice. Again, I tried to envision this hotel in it's heyday, and loved seeing everything decorated period. The rooftop pool give an exceptional view of the city, all the way to the Mississippi River. Very nice. The hotel has some of the better parking, valet only in a lot right next to the hotel. Leaving the car behind is not a problem, because there is so much to do within walking distance.

Don't worry, it's very mild and I'm sure most people don't even notice anything, but my keen Northern nose picks up on the different scent that we don't experience at home. An early check in was accommodated with no issues (arrived at 11:00 AM), we were given a very nice room, had a fruit basket delivered later due to the fact that we were repeat guests, enjoyed the PB&J at night, room service for coffee was very quick, location to the FQ/river/Canal/shopping was perfect, etc. All was great!

I called the front desk and they said they would look into it and call me back in a few minutes. They never called back. So, I called again about 45 minutes later, and they said that the hot water was out on our floor. I asked if they knew when it would be on again, and the women said she didn't ask the engineer when it would come on, but she would call me back to let us know. She never called back. We called again, and this time they said we could shower on another floor, but then called back almost immediately after the arrangements were made and said that the water was out in the entire building. The estimated time for it to return was \"30 minutes\" so we made the decision (the wrong one) to wait for the water. Now, I understand that things happen and everything is not always perfect. That's the way it goes. Ultimately, all totaled, we ended up being in our room for an additional 2.5 hours longer than we wanted to with all of the back & forth with the staff (who weren't extremely helpful) regarding the water and when it would be on. By the time we left at noon, there still was no hot water in the entire hotel. We decided to just take ice cold showers and get on with our day. In the end, lesson learned. The next time I'm at a hotel and there is no hot water, I will alert the staff, but I will just take a cold shower no matter what they say as to when the problem will be fixed.

I feel I understand the core values you are charged with instilling and cultivating in your organization. To begin with, Ms. Paula Purvis orchestrated all of the details perfectly. She coordinated with the Concierge staff (Mark), and the bar staff (A black lady that called everyone Baby). Mark, and his group set up 4 sets of reservations at Pascal Manalli's, Court of the Two Sisters, Arnaud's, and Brennen's. They worked from a list I gave them with times and restaurant preferences. They worked over three days working the times and alternatives. Ultimately, everything was perfect and executed without a hitch. The lady in the bar started at 1:30 on Sunday getting the tables arranged for optimum game viewing. Her recommendations for appetizers was spot on. She had everything arranged perfectly when my guests arrived at 5PM. Throughout the weekend (and in truth the week prior), your staff demonstrated tremendous attention to detail, clear and concise communications, follow through, and the highest standard of customer service. The glue that held all of this together was Ms. Purvis. I know the secret to growing and building a business is to gain one or more new customers each day.

The representative I spoke to said, I see you booked this through Hotwire, you should call them to see if they will refund your trip due to the extreme weather circumstances that prohibited travel out of ATL. I told her that an attempt to do so had failed. She basically said I should not take no for an answer, agreed to approve the cancellation, and noted it on my reservation. Next call to Hotwire was successful based on that information. The rep put me on hold while she called the hotel to confirm what I had told them. Refund was approved immediately.

The location of Le Pavillon is ideal for attending events at the Superdome, as it is an easy stroll up Poydras.

It is likewise a short walk to the river (where the Aquarium, Harrah's and Riverwalk mall can be accessed) and to the WWII Museum downtown (MUST VISIT!!). All in all, an excellent location for what we had in mind. The Suite itself was very spacious and well appointed, though the bedrooms and bathrooms themselves were no larger or nicer than those in the rest of the hotel (I imagine). Since the sitting area and dining room were so spacious, we were able to host a pre-Sugar Bowl cocktail party for some of our friends attending the event. I found the staff to be very accomodating, though in arranging for a selection of simple hors d'ouevres for our cocktail party, I felt I got gouged by Food and Beverage (partially my fault for not hammering down the details in advance).

Back then, the hotel had a reputation for being clean, cheap, convenient, and elegant. These days, Le Pavillon is trying to pass itself off as an elegant, old world, \"four and a half star\" hotel full of New Orleans charm. As a New Orleans native staying in the hotel for an anniversary night away from the kids, I chose Le Pavillon because of its good location & decent prices. I wasn't interested in the nostalgia (drawn \"voodoo\" baths, old style service). I just hoped to find a nice, clean room where my husband and I could spend a comfortable quiet night together after an evening of walking around the city & eating good food. What we experienced, instead, was one of the worst nights of sleep we'd ever had. The whole hotel is musty--from the front lobby to the elevator to the wide hallways to the rooms. But the mustiest part of Le Pavillon is their beds. Ours was covered with an outdated and grimy flowery bedspread. I removed it immediately upon entering the room. The throw pillows were equally grimy, which was really too bad because they were the only firm looking pillows in the room. The two bed pillows were so lumpy and mushy that even when squished into a ball they provided no head support. The bed was covered with a flat, not fitted, sheet, which was the only thing between us and the old blue uncomfortable mattress. Since the sheet was flat, it kept coming up throughout the night as we tossed and turned, leaving us to wake up and find ourselves drowsing on the old mattress itself, where hundreds if not thousands of other bodies had similarly lain. The only clean bed covering was an old polyester blanket between two worn sheets. I hardly slept all night, being waken continually by general discomfort and noises in the hallway. The bathroom was better than the bedroom--it was clean and the fixtures, while not at all modern, were nice and worked fine. The hotel provided shampoo but no conditioner (however, they did provide shoe polish...???). The carpets in the room and hallway were old and worn down. We weren't impressed with the PB&J bar at 10pm. It's a nice gesture--but it didn't make up for our general discomfort in the hotel. Overall, I am not a picky hotel goer. We stay at a range of two to four star hotels, mostly basing our decisions on prices. We got a good deal on Le Pavillon--$113 per night from hotwire. But even at that price, I would not recommend it.

We were in New Orleans for a conference/convention, but wanted to stay a little closer to the French Quarter rather than the Convention Center. The hotel is about 4-5 blocks (10 min walk) from Bourbon Street and 1 mile from the Convention Center (20 min walk). The location was great for the purpose of our trip. There is not much in the immediate vicinity, but as mentioned, the French Quarter is just a short walk away. The outside of the hotel is quite grand as is the lobby. It was decorated for Christmas/Holidays and was truly lovely. The old, Victorian style may not be for everyone, but regardless of your personal taste, the hotel is undoubtedly pretty. We arrived at around 11am and were able to check in right away. Paula, at the front desk was very warm and welcoming and very efficient in getting us squared away. We were all given double rooms on the 5th floor. While the floral bedspread and window treatments are a bit dated, they seem to fit the character of the hotel. The bathroom, while small, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in terms of d\u00c3\u00a9cor/marble/mirror, etc. My co-workers had similar rooms, though I noticed one had a coffee maker and microwave. I am a big coffee drinker, so called the front desk and asked whether I could also get a coffee pot/set up. In no time, a nice Keurig \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one cupper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was delivered. The free wireless & high speed internet was a plus, too. The bed was reasonably comfortable, but I did find the pillows to be a bit lumpy. I did appreciate the little touches like an umbrella in the room for use, robes and plush towels. The staff in both the dining room and bar was extremely friendly and efficient. (NOTE: the evening bartender makes a mean dirty martini!)

The rooms were a bit old-fashioned, but clean and comfortable. The staff was incredibly helpful. They sat us down at the beginning of the stay and asked what we were interested in, and then helped us plan dinner and our sight-seeing agenda-- it was like having a free travel agent. They also had one of my fav hotel perks-- a bath menu. I ordered the $30 relaxation bath, and omg, they absolutely transformed the room. They laid out robes and slippers, fruit, tea, a little booklet on the ghost stories of the hotel, covered the whole room in fresh rose petals, and drew a deliciously warm bath for me. This was great to come back to after the free PB&Js in the lobby. By the way, the hotel is absolutely gorgeous. All in all, this hotel had so much charm and character that it really stood out from all the other hotels we've stayed in.

We were happy to get rooms next door to each other. I like more modern hotels, but the decor here was still very beautiful. Our problems began on the first evening when my friend pulled the comforter back as she was getting into her bed to take a nap. There was a HUGE round blood stain on the inside of the comforter. We called the front desk to tell them about the situation and asked that they send housekeeping up to our room to change both bed sheets and comforters. A VERY nice housekeeper came to replace the sheets and requested new comforters for both beds. We were supposed to get them the next morning. Of course, we didn't. While the housekeeeper was in the room, I noticed that the entire shower head (which was one of the larger ones) was completely covered in mildew. I asked her to look at it to confirm and she did. At this point I was completely annoyed. I called the front desk again and asked that a manager call our room. Someone named Justin, who I'm not sure is even a manager called to speak with us. He was so nonchalant about the bloody sheets that I was convinced this had happened before. The mold didn't seem much of a suprise at all. He offered to send the engineer up to change the showerhead. Ya think? I told him how disgusted we were with finding blood and mold on our first night in the hotel and he didn't seem to care much. A few minutes later he called back and offered us a bottle of alcohol. I don't know about anyone else, but drink didn't seem like much compensation for mold and bloody sheets in our hotel room. When I told him that we didn't drink, he offered us cheese and crackers. Really? I told him we weren't interested in that either. When the engineer came in to change the shower head with the smallest showerhead I'd ever seen in my life, he screamed upon entering the bathroom and seeing the mold. That's how bad it was. He couldn't believe it. The next evening, the lovely housekeeper from the evening before came back to check on us. When we told her that no one followed up with us or brought comforters, not only did she bring comforters to our room, but re-made our beds, which weren't made properly. Then brought us a few free bottle of water. When we received our bill on the last night, there were charges for liquor that we hadn't purchased in the minibar. Another annoyance. When we checked out, they gave us absolutely no problem with fixing the bill. I'm pretty sure they usually sneak these extra charges on their bills because there were two other guests in the lobby complaing of the same thing. When we asked to speak with a mgr about our ordeal, the woman that was checking us out said she was a mgr. When we explained to her all that happened, she responded, \"oh I heard about that.\" I told her that it was unacceptable that no one even thought to call and check in with us throughout the rest of our 3 day stay. She stated, \"you know, that's my fault. I was supposed to. I'm sorry, I didn't.\" This was one of the most expensive hotels I've ever stayed in and by far, the nastiest. The rooms and most of the staff just STUNK. Let me be specific... the concierage had a HORRIBLE attitude along with the front desk staff and manager. Please don't stay here. I don't care what it was rated, you can have a better stay elsewhere and spend less money. It was the ONLY unpleasant part of my first New Orleans experience.

The common areas have a luxurious french country feel and are resplendent with art, chandeliers and antique furniture. The rooms have vaulted ceilings and comfy beds. The best feature, however, is the people. When I called the reservations department prior to our trip to tell them it was our anniversary, the woman I spoke to was gracious and thanked me for letting them know. When we got to New Orleans and checked in, everyone from the doorman to the bellhop to the woman at the front desk were friendly and sincerely interested in welcoming us to the city and the hotel. My wife went down one morning to get coffee and saw the staff setting up in the Crystal Room for a wedding that night. Noticing that she was interested, one of the banquet servers invited her to return once they had finished setting up to take some pictures. He told her jokingly that she was a \"platinum\" guest. The doorman (Cedric) always asked if we needed directions when we left and offered enthusiastic recommendations for the best restaurants. Check out the hotel's website. It has a section titled \"Treasures\" and before describing the priceless art and antiques it describes the hotel's longtime employees. Exactly right. The location was perfect for us but some might find it too far from the action. If was a five to ten minute walk to the French Quarter, so getting to some of the restaurants, Cafe du Monde, the riverfront, etc., was a bit of a hike. The upside, however, is that we had total peace at night. It was a respite from the delicious madness that is New Orleans. The roof pool and hot tub are mind-blowing. You can see the Mississippi River, the SuperDome and the New Orleans skyline. It's open until 1:00 a.m., so you can return from a full night of partying to the solitude of clear water and the night sky. One morning we started our day at the pool and ordered coffee and Bloody Marys poolside. Not bad. The late night peanut butter and jelly snack is a classy touch, but we missed it every night thanks to the action on Bourbon Street, Frenchmen Street and at the Howlin' Wolf.

They do have a very good wireless connection for the Internet. The doors are fairly thin so if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room that is away from the elevator. Also, I usually left the hotel with several other people so it was not a problem but if you are going to the French Quarter at night, I would definitely come back in a group. It is not that bad but there are some empty buildings that make it a little scary. The Quarter is MAYBE a 5-10 minute walk so it is easy to get to and it is great because you do not hear the noise from the quarter from inside the hotel. One last thing, if you are coming to this hotel for a conference, BRING A SWEATER or sport coat. They keep all the conference rooms at unusually cool temperatures.

Our junior-suite room contained several dusty fake flower arrangements (think 1980's). In addition, we expected that a hotel of this caliber would have a down duvet and high-thread count sheets. Instead, it had a ratty polyester bedspread with the same ugly, outdated, dusty floral theme as the rest of the hotel and dining area.

We called the front desk for a few items, and they were promptly delivered, and, when our bathtub drain was clogged, the hotel fixed it later that day. However, we were concerned about the cleanliness of the room. The room contained a bar sink, which was also clogged. Instead of cleaning out the drain, the housekeeper simply left it and all of the crud it contained laying on the side of the sink. Another day, the housekeeper left her wet cleaning rags behind - yuck! The hotel is located in the quiet Central Business District, which unfortunately doesn't seem to be thriving.

Have visited New Orleans a couple of times before and stayed at the Sheraton and the Marriott on Canal but wanted something more luxurious--even though I was traveling for work, it was my birthday too so I thought it'd be fun to step it up a notch. Unfortunately, what I got wasn't quite what I expected. This hotel has a lovely staff but the accommodations are seriously DATED. My room looked dingy and was overall, lackluster. One lamp didn't work, the carpet was old, bed linens ancient too, and the bed was crooked--the base of the bed was up higher than the top. Also, chips on the wall from where furniture hit it. I was disappointed. I tried to get another room but because of the NCAA tournament, they were booked. I asked about the penalties for switching to another hotel and the manager would charge me one night's fee (even though I literally, opened the door took a look at the room and turned around and left). Still, I was willing to accept the penalty because the room was that unsatisfactory but I couldn't find another room anywhere else. Also, at first the manager was a little rude and unsympathetic, but once I was reduced to tears out of shear frustration, exhaustion (had been on the road since 5AM and have a new baby at home), and general disappointment, she tried to be nice. The staff flipped the mattress and re-made the bed and they left me a complimentary bottle of champagne. It was a decent gesture. Also, the restaurant has good food and service but in all honesty, I would not recommend this hotel, not for the price--you can stay at nicer places for the same money.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious and friendly\u201d", "Author": "summerbum", "ReviewID": "UR57892624", "Content": "This hotel is full-on baroque gorgeous--marble and crystal and velvet draperies everywhere.

The trip was a birthday celebration for my spouse who as a New Orleans native wanted to celebrate her 40th Birthday with family and friends in her Home town. Also we were married in NOLA 16 years ago. We had the eight floor executive suite, when I opened the door of the suite, my wife who was conducting last minute telephone work details said, \"oh my God\". First the suite was a two bedroom suite with 2 1/2 bathrooms, with a 60 inch flat screen HD TV, full surround sound,baby grand player piano, full dining room with a fully loaded lighted china cabinet and a 10 chair dining room, marble foyer, full bar, ice maker,microwave, ice maker, refrig,etc. Heck I did'nt feel like I left home. The suite was probably 2500 sq ft. marble foyer area, fireplace 3 additional TV's. It exceeded all of my expectations. The decor of the hotel is Old World, like a hotel in Europe, oil paintings, heavy drapery, marble, opulent trim and gold leaf every where just like I like it, New Orleans style . As a benefit of my Leaders club status, we we welcomed with vouchers for the buffet breakfast every day of our stay and a bottle of french red wine with a fruit tray and truffles all of which were delicious. The breakfast buffet included grits, fruit and an omelet station which all were delicious. I have to send a shout out to the hotel staff, Paula (16years) and Mrs. Georges(35 years) who made our visit feel like home instead of a Hotel Stay. Yes the hotel is old but not in a bad way, but very unique and charming. The Christmas decorations were still up upon our arrival and they were outstanding, so much we had several of the same ornaments on our two trees at home.

This was my third trip to New Orleans and I decided to avoid the corporate hotels and go somewhere classic, somewhere that would really live up to the historical atmosphere that pervades New Orleans. After seeing the high reviews here, and seeing the modest prices at hotels.com, I decided to book Le Pavillon. This is not a huge opulent hotel. The lobby is modestly but comfortably sized, with furniture like you'd expect in a French home and large chandeliers. When I arrived, the hotel computers were down, so they signed me in manually, based on my printed email of the reservation. There was no bellhop to be seen, and no one offered to get me one. It was about 730pm. I ordered room service and because the computers were down, I had to pay with cash or credit card, rather than charging to the room. This puzzled me, since I had just checked in by giving my credit card number, but I was tired and hungry so I didn't argue. The hotel food/room service was pretty consistently good. I tried club sandwich, burger, gumbo, beef burgendy, fried oysters, and the stir fry during my lengthy stay and all were quite adequate. The deserts were bad: a very dry brownie and a waxy piece of cheesecake. I got a standard 2 queen bed room and will say it is smaller than it appears in the pictures at the hotel website. The bedspread and curtains are just as dated as they appear in pictures and I suspect they aren't cleaned very often. Each day I came back to the room after my conference, I promptly stripped the bed of the bedspread and numerous decorative pillows, just so I felt like I was sitting on something clean. There was a ceiling fan which was nice on days I came back after lots of walking in the humidity. The AC worked better than the heating. Beds were comfortable but the pillows were extremely \"mushy\" and I had to stack up two just to get good support. The bathrooms are small....pretty close to unacceptably small. Not near enough counterspace for 2 people to put out all their toiletries. The shower was fine in terms of water pressure and height for the shower head. The half glass door shielding the room from the water spray was a bit dodgy but adequate from leaving the room soaked. For the most part, the room was quiet. I did check out the pool on the roof which is smaller than it appears on the hotel's website, but a nice touch. The fitness room seemed well stocked with equipment. The staff at the hotel seems to regularly get high praise here and it seemed mostly deserved. The girl who served room service a couple of times was very sweet, though not terribly competent, forgetting numerous items and failing to bring everything on her return trip. The front desk was friendly, and kind enough to loan me an ethernet cable to take advantage of the free in room internet service. I heard towards the end of my stay they will even loan you a MICROWAVE, in case you have leftovers from dining out! Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad hotel. I certainly do not think it is worthy of being in the top 10 or even top 20 hotels in New Orleans though.

The service was good and the food was OK for hotel restaurant food. The hot chocolate was good and a nice touch. The only problem I had was the water draining from the bath tub. It was slow to drain so it was a little gross to stand in yucky water and wait for it to drain before someone else can shower. The parking for the valet is very secure so after reading some other reviews about security I was really happy that Le Pavillion takes car security serious.

We didn't have any problems with the room or our stay that needed addressing. In fact, the only service we needed was a wake up call, which was on time. Overall Le Pavillon was a great experience, and the price was fantastic considering the opulent feel of the hotel. The Central Business District location is great - the side street leads right to Bourbon Street, if you're interested. The farther reaches of the French Quarter were an easy walk away. We felt safe walking in the area at all times. The hotel is also only a block or so away from both the Canal and St. Charles street car lines, and cabs were easy to get for farther trips.

The hotel is small enough that we did not have to walk very far to our rooms, and we got instant service whenever we asked for anything. Nightly turndown service was very complete, with ice replenished, bottles of water, little peanut butter shortbread cookies, and the weather forecast. As an example of how customer oriented they are, we lost 2 of their umbrellas, but Le Pavillon waived any charge. The last day we took a quick look at the pool and exercise area, and they offer an impressive rooftop view. If we had more time we would have worked off a few more beignets.

We were there for four nights. The hotel was recommended by a friend from New Orleans, but the reviews in Tripadvisor convinced us to book. (Since I live in a major tourist location myself, I think that locals may not be the best source of information since they don't usually stay at the local hotels.) Checked in about 8:00PM after a 30 hour Amtrak trip from New York. The room was ready and check in was a breeze. I love the fact that the hotel gives guests at least double the number of towels etc. usually left in a guest room. That way, if the hotel does not offer turn-down service, there are enough fresh towels for two showers per day. That in itself endeared Le Pavillon to me, since I was able to shower before exploring the French Quarter that night. The hotel is beautiful. Decor is a combo of 17th, 18th, and Belle Epoche styles all very French. The room was big with an armoire, a desk , three chairs, a table plus a large closet. The bathroom was resplendent with its black marble and loads and loads of goodies -- over the top. The room was also made up very quickly and always ready when we returned before or after lunch. We had dinner in the beautiful bar the evening before we left. The food was good although we had simple pub fare. Didn't eat in the dining room but it looked beautiful. I was surprised that the prices for food are so reasonable. This is often not the case for hotel food. At first I did not like the location which is a few blocks from the French Quarter (perhaps 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street). The Pavillion is on the other side of Canal Street from the Quarter. However, after my first day in the French Quarter, a continual party, I began to appreciate the more subdued location. It is also close to the St. Charles Avenue line which goes to the Garden District. There is really nothing to complain about regarding this hotel. There is a very nice and large rooftop pool. The place is classy, but the prices to me at least, seemed very very reasonable, even low. If I could make one suggestion, it would be to offer coffee in the lobby so I would not need room service to get me started for the day. However, they do have a wonderful evening tradition -- hot chocolate or milk and you make your own peanut butter and jelly sandwich each night in the lobby between ten and eleven PM.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookhaven,MS", "Title": "\u201cTrue French New Orleans Perfection\u201d", "Author": "bagspacked205", "ReviewID": "UR35748919", "Content": "My stay at the Le Pavillon Hotel was the wonderful!

I wanted him to remember it for the rest of his life! Im sure that I accomplished THAT, even though it was a Nightmare! It started the day of the party. The caterer (At a local restaurant) called to tell us that a fire had damaged all the underground electrical lines in the quarter and they had no electricity. It was expected to return that evening but they could not garantee it. I called the hotel where we had our reservations for the weekend (We live about an hour from the city) Lights were out there as well. Thats where it all fell apart. To make a long story short. No hotels were available since the people in the affected area had been moved to the outlying hotels with elect. I finally found the last room... At Le Pavillion. I was told by the operator that it was the last room and the price was 1,000.00 take it or leave it. (It was a suite so I thought OK it should be worth it) I took it since I had 30 people arriving for a candlelight dinner in less than an hour. They \"made me pay for the room upfront. Like some common hour rental motel. Then after finally being checked in by the less than friendly front desk personnel. We (My Mother and myself) RAN to the room to get dressed. (We now had 45 min. till my husband arrived to his surprise party.) The room was full of antiques which had seen better days. But was hot as all getup. We adjusted the Air (MInd you we are in Louisiana, it was HOT) As I was blow drying my hair, POP the electricity went out! In the whole room. I called downstairs and someone showed up eventually. I now have 15 min. till the party. Guest have arrived. They got the electricity on and we bolted out the door! We grabbed a drink (And Lord knows we needed one) at the bar on the way out While in the cab we noticed the cost of 2 mimosas. $45.00 plus tax and tip!!!! Yikes What type of Champange did they use? Dom? Anyway we made it to the party, which was salvaged, barely! When my husband and I returned to the room that night. The Air Conditioning had gone out again. It felt like a sauna. We called down again and someone came up and put some kind of laser thing at the vent and said \"Its reading 65 degrees\" as beeds of sweat dripped off his nose. To hell it was we said. He shrugged his shoulders and said it was all he could do since it was 3:00 am. We then attempted to go to sleep. Not easy while your sweating profusely. My husband got up to turn off the TV (Which must have been an antique too, since it did not have a remote) and the door to the armoire fell off and hit him in the forehead! All I kept thinking was $1000.00 a night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Somewhere around 5:00am we were awakened by the sound of the window shade falling off the window. $1000.00 a night! Im the morning, and there was no sleeping in, we ran down to the front desk to complain to the Manager and we were told they didnt know who that was at the time. They said they would have him call. (Never did get that call!) We complained to our credit card company and when they called LePavillion to investigate they were told \"The manager had gone up to hear our complaint about the electricity and the air and had found 25 peop[le in the room.

If you are looking especially for a quiet, historic, friendly atmophere, that may be found mid-week (Monday-> Thursday). But on week-ends the atmosphere changes, and if this is not what you are looking for, it would be better to limit the stay to mid-week.

The hotel is a five block walk from Bourbon Street and the French Quarter, which is just far enough that you can escape the madness and noise, but not too far to walk in comfortable shoes. I made the walk nightly, either to eat out or enjoy a drink or two, and found it generally pleasant.

My six yaer old orddered chicken tenders with broccoli they treated her like royalty . The hotel was not very busy it was just after Mardi Gras I had requested a sitter before arriving so me and my older children could go to bourbon st but due to the drive I was not in the mood to go out the rates were 12$ hour for min 4 hours. so they cancelled for me and we were givin no charge. We checked into our rooms we asked to be in the most haunted part we had room # 630 a standerd double the rooms were very pretty and comfortable not a modern 4 star but what it lacked in modern it made up for in everything else. so after checking into our rooms we decided to explore the hotel you can recieve upon request the history of the hotel ask Lou she will give you this lovely little history .We asked if we could see any of the haunted rooms and due to the fact the hotell was slow the conceirge Lou let the bellman take us on a tour of every suit which was very cool we saw napoleones bath tub the antiques are amazing. after our tour it was time for the hot cocoa and peunut butter finger sandwiches in the lobby do not miss it is so yummy . so we went back to our rooms and took a nice bath do bring conditioner if you have hard to comb hair they do not have but the soap is french milled and lotion very pleasant all in black and gold do look in your closet they have robes and umbrellas. the beds were comfy and we had no ghosts.

Friday and Saturday evening there were weddings going on and we were told we couldn't eat in The Crystal Room.

The weddings also made it almost unbearably crowded. When the children and I came down for the PB&J sandwiches, it was set up amidst an extremely loud carousing wedding reception. According to a staff member we spoke to, this pretty much goes on every weekend all weekend long so if you're going during the week, you shouldn't have this problem.

Great staff and service - in fact all of New Orleans was great for that - from the cab drivers to the hotel staff, everyone was wonderful. However in relation to the hotel and the room itself I did have some issues. I realize it is an old hotel but you could hear people through the walls very easily. Perhaps it was the people themselves next door but, having stayed at other 4 star \"older\" hotels, noise was definitely more of an issue here. More problematic was the cleanliness of the room. I am a bit neurotic about it admittedly however one has to wonder when the last time the carpets were cleaned (and not just vacuumed). I would have a shower, run to get something from my suitcase while my feet were still damp and then look down and see dark footprints on the white tile of the bathroom! I'm going to chalk this up to the fact that the hotel room must have been a smoker's room back when you could smoke in the hotel but it was sorta disgusting regardless. We eventually asked the hotel staff if we could change rooms and they were more than accommodating about it. Paula in particular was of great assistance. Our new room was much cleaner and came with a newly renovated bathroom. Again however, one has to wonder when the mattress covers are changed because one could see through the (very thin) bed sheets an assortment of hairs from previous guests I guess that were still clinging to the mattress cover. This is really unacceptable for a 4 star place. Again however, a quick chat with the cleaning staff and all was well - it's just too bad that we had to have the chat in the first place. Ah well...In the end, everything that people have said about this place re: character, charm and elegance is true. Just remember that this is an old hotel with thin walls and is not as clean as it can be. It's a true testament to the quality of the people there and the other facilities within the hotel that I am still giving this 3 1/2 stars (the Tripadvisor review site won't let me put in 3 1/2 so I'll just leave it at 4 I guess)...Also free wireless in the hotel was a nice plus (didn't know if they would have it given that it was an older hotel)... New Orleans is fantastic by the way. I highly recommend Magazine Street and the Garden District as well as a few restaurants: Acme Oyster, Jacque-Mo's and Elizabeth's...Frenchmen Street down river from the French Quarter is also not to be missed if you like jazz (Bourbon Street bars play nothing but bad live rock music so don't go there if you want jazz).", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cOld time charm & Southern hospitality\u201d", "Author": "measical", "ReviewID": "UR26536857", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed over St. Pat's and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay.

The LePavillon Hotel was exactly what we needed. If you have seen the movie \"Gone w/the Wind\" then the lobby will be a replica. Of course this is just my opinion. The lobby and the dining room was exquisite. Now I must confess that the room (King size) how ever breathtaking it was, is a little small but still very beautiful. The decor of the bathroom was chic. But you won't be in the room that much because there is so much to do. We were there for five days. Most of the time we rode the street car which is a 1.25 one way. I would also recommend that if you are going to be out pretty late take the taxi from LePavillion to the casino or to the French Quarter. It will run you around $8 or $9 dollars one way. I probably gained 10lbs because food is everywhere. The hotel offers a buffet for $18 have Pat make you an omelet!!!!. Often we would return to the hotel late and would still be hungry. The food from room service was great. It will probably run you around $50 and up. Also, please, please take the Katina tour. What you see in the tourist area is not what you will see during this tour. If while you are on the tour and they don't mention about the bridge that goes to Ward 9, please inquire.

A beautiful lobby that looks like it came out of a movie set. Gaudy and over the top, just like something in New Orleans should be. The service was warm without being pushy. Particularly the staff in the Crystal Room Dining Room was particularly pleasant. I had booked on Orbitz and there was a free breakfast buffet included. This was without a doubt the most beautiful breakfast room I have ever eaten in (and I have stayed in a few nice hotels around the world). If I had not had included for free, I am not sure I would have shelled out 17.99 for the breakfast as I don't eat that much. However, the spread was impressive and a great brunch deal for those with an appetite. And unlike the other Orbitz customer who felt they had received a worse room due to this breakfast deal, I was actually given an upgrade for my room. The room itself was well appointed and quiet. The style is Victorian with tall and spacious rooms. Admittedly, this is a 100 year old hotel and not everything is brand spanking new. The bathtub and shower could use a wee bit of an upgrade. But certainly nothing was wrong enough that should put off anyone. The 37 or so pillows on the bed were probably more than I need, but that is the kind of over the top decoration choices that give the hotel its particular charm. I admit I also like a hotel that still gives you personalized terry cloth robes to use, has their own stationery in the rooms, and leaves you a welcome note in an engraved card. The hotel is in walking distance to the French Quarter. There are also some interesting neighborhoods just across the street around the courthouse and other legal buildings and alleys. Sadly, like most of New Orleans in the area you can find many buildings and businesses still waiting to recover from Katrina. Not everything in the hotel was perfect, and any hundred year old hotel has a few frayed edges. At the same time, there are wonderful ornate hallways and public spaces that you rarely find outside of hotels costing many times more. If you want austere, sterile, perfection, you probably are better going with some chic uber modern chain (and probably the New Orleans Big Easy attitude isn't going to be for you anyway).

We had a few small glitches with the plumbing in the bathroom...the water wouldn't turn off every time...we did not report this tho as we usually were able to turn it off.

Recommendation - Doorman should be extra courteous and understanding to make up for a very small driveway. He ultimately amended himself. Parking fee seemed high at over $30 for one night as compared to a recent trip to Northern California staying at the Renaissance. The registration area also seems small as compared to other hotels and is further obscured by a huge plant separating the two work stations. I almost missed it walking into the hotel. Somehow their registration system had me down for two nights, when I had booked only one night. Desk person was beginning to argue how many nights I had checked in until I showed her the printed receipt clearly pointing out one night. This was the second bad impression, but she too also regulated herself and we concluded the business at hand. The young bellman who helped us to the room with our bags made a very positive impression. He was well-spoken, courteous, not overly intrusive with questions. Even when he offered to \"orient\" us to our room (something I never accept), I said ok. Main difficulty was that the room we stayed in (609) is very dusty, dark and smells of mold and mildew. Positively cavelike. Bath had visible signs of mold. In fact the entire 6th floor smells musty. This gives the impression of lack of care and led me to wonder whether there might be health risks in ordering food or using the hotel's other amenities like the pool. Concierge gave us some good ideas for a family friendly dinner. PBJ reception is the first I ever attended and it is a nice idea, unfortunately executed poorly. Hot chocolate was finished by the time daughter and I got there. Lack of more than one serving station meant everyone had to line up which made this nice idea a chore. Recommendation - Multiple serving stations that are staggered throughout the lobby so that only minimal lines are formed.

In my experience there are both advantages and compromises in staying at such a property. I like my history but I also like my latest and greatest features and technology and I'm generally not a B&B guy. Le Pavillon is definitely worth some of the compromises. The location is good if you want to be near the Superdome, Central Business District and French Quarter. The good news if you want it a bit quieter at night is that you are very near but not in the French Quarter. We booked on Hotwire and as other reviewers have suggested upgraded to a Deluxe King room. Room service was excellent and prompt. In general the service was tremendous from every staff member that we encountered. Very attentive.

Then go on to say that this may not be the hotel for everyone. This is not a national chain hotel; it is a place that is so rich in tradition and elegance that some may feel uncomfortable in a place that it is not decorated by Cort Furniture, with gas station art on the walls, lumpy beds and stiff scratchy linens. Le Pavillon is unique. It is beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and very gracious. The room in which we stayed was very comfortable though could have used a bit more flat surface space. Having read many of the reviews before our stay we were a bit worried about the bedding. We had no reason to. The king sized bed was almost as comfortable as our 5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pillow top. The room was beautiful, the chairs comfortable & the rest of the furniture was quite elegant. The bathroom was incredible. It was entirely modernized with very sexy black tiles and the wall above the countertop was mirrored from backsplash to ceiling. The shower head was a beautiful ceramic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153squash flower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with plenty of pressure and hot water. Nice bathrobes were provided and there were large towels aplenty. One of the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in my travels. We arrived fairly early in the day and were given an early check in. When we came back in from an hour stroll around the area we found a basket of fruit and a bottle of their own bottled local spring water in the room. While reading the hotel directory I noticed that coffee makers were available by calling guest services. I called and within an hour they delivered a coffee maker, oversized cups and Community Coffee. This was kept stocked for entire stay. After returning from dinner we found our bed turned down, two more bottles of water and two peanut butter and jelly cookies with the recipe on our night table. This was repeated each night. The hotel staff was fantastic. Every request that we made was granted. One of the nights was my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday and she wanted a Muffelatta from Napoleon House but they stop serving food at 5:30 and that was too early for us so I asked the concierge if we could bring one in and have it heated up in their kitchen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes sir just ask the hostess and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take care of it for you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the answer. When the time came I spoke with the hostess and gave directions on the proper heating of the sandwich which meant wrapped in tinfoil in the oven for twenty to thirty minutes not the microwave. It was done to perfection. On the way back to the room we were the envy of all of the guest that we ran into. The Concierge staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We wanted to visit a cemetery and they recommended a tour with a non profit that is involved with the cemetery rather that a crowded tour operated by one of the big companies. The same kind of recommendation was made for a bayou tour. Our only complaint was there was that the room refrigerator was filled with mini bar items. We prefer our own favorite beverages and foods whilst traveling but when we requested and extra ice bucket one was delivered immediately. All in all a very satisfying stay and we will stay again next year when we return for Jazz Fest.

And why no tea and coffee making facilities in the room? The note goes on, \"May every call you make, every message you receive and every person you meet add to your joy.\" Great.

I visit New Orleans several times a year and have stayed in many different hotels there, this was my second stay at Le Pavillion. I am also a frequent business traveler. While the hotel is in a great location, and doesn't compare to other 4 stars I've stayed in bedding or amenity-wise, the stellar service is what made my experience memorable. Here is why: 1. My luggage did not arrive on my flight, and was delivered to the hotel several hours later. While I was in the check-in line, the bellman, Nabil, asked if he could help me. I told him with a smile, \"No thanks, just checking in, with no luggage\". He asked right away if I needed a toothbrush or anything. I said that would be great. He came back a few seconds later with a toothbrush, paste and deoderant. I did not ask for this, he was just attentive and it was very appreciated. 2. My luggage came very late that night (230am) and it was wet. The desk attendant asked if there was anything I needed as my bag was wet - again, attention to detail that was not asked for. 3. The next morning was a bit chilly, but I visited the pool anyway. I was the only one there, reading my paper on a chaise. A housekeeper came out to blow leaves off the patio with a blower. I didn't care, she was just doing her job. About 2 minutes into this, someone came out and called her away. She came back and said, \"I'm so sorry to have disturbed you\" and began to sweep the leaves up instead of blow them. I told her she did not disturb me, it was fine. But what?? Someone was aware that one guest was out there, so she changed her routine to accomodate. Again, I didn't care or complain about this. 4. When I was leaving my room to check out, a housekeeper had just stepped off the elevator and was going down the hall in the opposite direction. She saw me come out of my room, from quite far away, and went back to the elevator to hold the door for me. 5. When I checked out, there was a mistake on my bill from the service bar that I did not even know about. The desk agent, who was training asked if I had anything from the service bar. I told her what I had, she said, \"well this is an error then, I will adjust your bill\" and she credited me $56. Once again, unsolicited. I was truly amazed by the level of service exhibited by every single person I encountered during this stay. While the rooms are not the newest, or the beds the best, and there was no coffee maker in the room - that is not what will stand out in my mind. The excellent service and attitude of the employees is what made this stay most enjoyable. I would have no hesitation to return or recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Average Room at Le Pavillon\u201d", "Author": "Nash_Andrew", "ReviewID": "UR15029143", "Content": "Le Pavillon offers top notch service, average rooms, and a heavy dose of New Orleans charm. Overall, depending on how much you pay, Le Pavillon is a solid choice in New Orleans. Girlfriend and I booked Le Pavillon for 3 nights, April 11-14, through Priceline. Winning bid was $79 per night, plus tax. A few days before check in, I called the hotel asking what kinds of upgrades might be available. The reservations desk informed me that Priceline books into queen rooms, and that I could upgrade to a king room for $10 more per night. Done. We arrived around 8pm Friday. Service at the door, bellstand, and check in counter was beyond friendly and very smooth. We were checked in within a couple of minutes. Our bellhop introduced himself, asked our names, and every time we saw him throughout our entire stay he spoke to us by name. We were whisked to the room and given a thorough and friendly introduction to the room and the hotel. All in all, a very nice welcome to the property. Now, the room. The hotel is 100 years old and there's no doubt that it is showing some age. The room is the kind that looks great on first glance but upon closer inspection shows some wear. Things like: door stoppers that are broken, small amounts of peeling paint on the bathroom ceiling, a greasy remote control, way old school tube tv, etc. These are all small items and they didn't really affect our stay. The bed - as also indicated by other reviewers - was not as good as it should have been. I typically stay in Marriotts and their Revive bedding blows Le Pavillon out of the water, as does Westin's Heavenly Bed. The mattress and pillows felt about 25 years old - not uncomfortable, but not what is standard in the hotel industry these days. Overall, the room gave the feeling that when it was originally decorated 15 years ago, it was absolutely top of the line. Now, it's just average, maybe slightly below average depending on how much you paid for your room. Other notes on the hotel: the rooftop deck and spa looked fine, again showing some age, but a very nice amenity to have. Didn't work out in the gym but it appeared perfectly suitable if not a little small. The common areas of the hotel, like the lobby and the Crystal Room restaurant, are exquisitely appointed. When you walk into the hotel you really feel like you are stepping back in time to the grander days of travel and the truly historic New Orleans experience. I have to say that my girlfriend and I really liked that. A couple words also about the location - it's on Poydras, in the middle of the CBD. The walk to Canal St. (edge of French Quarter) is about 7 minutes. I was worried that the walk would feel less than safe after dark, but that was not the case at all. As others have said, this is the kind of location where you can walk to dinner or the bars in the Quarter, but you probably want to take a cab home at 2am. Not the location for you if you want to stumble directly out of the bar into your bed. I should note that the St. Charles streetcar is a block away, and Mother's (great po' boys) about three blocks. Overall, Le Pavillon offers you a taste of the historic grandeur of New Orleans, with all the service you would expect. With that comes facilities that are a little worn around the edges. The room was a great deal at $89 per night, but if I were paying full price I'd probably prefer the Marriott. At the end of the day, it's the service that really makes this place shine, and I probably would have rated it 3 stars were it not for the standout performances of a number of the staff members.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill, NC", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel but not great\u201d", "Author": "Tarheel21", "ReviewID": "UR15015101", "Content": "I booked this hotel based on the reviews on this website at the time I was looking to make a reservation.

She didn't seem to care that someone on her staff told us they were holding our room. She also told us good luck at getting our money back from Hotwire, she could do nothing for us.

First, the bad: 1. Ok, it's me. I'll admit it. I'm very picky about pillows. I can't stand skinny hotel pillows and even though there were a lot of them -- and some of them were quite LONG, they were all really flat. I tried stacking them or folding them in half but they wouldn't stay put and I thought all was lost until I decided to take one out of its pillow case, fold it in half width-wise and put it back in the case. Problem solved! Since it was such a LONG pillow to begin with, it ended up half as long but still long enough. 2. This hotel is in the central business district, 4 blocks from the edge of the French Quarter. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the center of the French Quarter or a few minutes by taxi or by street car. This did not bother us at all but if you want to be able to stumble out of a bar and into your hotel, this isn't the place for you. If you do walk, go south on Poydras (in front of the hotel) and then turn left to get to the French Quarter. If you do the opposite (go east, along the side of the hotel and then turn south to enter the Quarter), it takes longer since the streets are not in a perfect grid, there. It's also a prettier walk down Poydras than the other way, Now, the good... 1. The hotel is beautiful. The front of the building is much nicer than it looks on the website and the lobby is gorgeous as is the dining room (including its large fireplace) and bar area. 2, The room was large and beautifully furnished. (A previous poster said the room was small?!). There was room for 2 queen beds plus a desk on one side and a round table with 2 large arm chairs on the other. That's big enough, isn't it? The bath had been remodeled and the shower was taller than me at 6'3\" (1.9 m). 3. The night-time peanut butter and jelly buffet with hot cocoa was great fun. 4. There was free, 24-hour internet access via a PC on the second floor (for those of us who don't like dragging our lap tops with us). Ask for the password at the front desk. 5. EVERYONE who worked there was incredibly kind and thoughtful. We were given great recommendations for a jazz club as well as a place for pecan pie. 6. The rooftop pool is on the small size but New Orleans is not really a \"resort city\" so we weren't put off by it. We did relax and talk on 2 chaise lounges, that are away from the pool in a little cabana, one late afternoon for about 2 hours and watched the sky get dark. 7.

We booked from Expedia for $99/night (paid $10 for an upgraded room). Check in was fine, the front desk was cordial but not exceptionally nice. The front lobby is very beautiful and was decorated for very nicely for Christmas time. During our three day stay we encountered the following problems: 1.) Room wasvsmall and not very attractively decorated. It was decorated in a faux 1800s style, but it looked like it was done with a $100 budget. From the gaudy table cloth that hung all over the floor, to the large and noticeably plastic plant on the armoire the room was just generally ugly. In addition it was extremely small, like NYC small. I have stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms in my life and this is one of the smallest. My girlfriend and I stumbled all over each other during the stay in the small room. It would help if instead of a table and 2 chairs they just left room to walk around, or put something more suitable, like a desk. I couldn't find a working outlet in the room without unplugging the lamps, and the heat was difficult to operate (some of that 17th century charm?), the toilet screeched for 30 seconds each time it was flushed, and finally a portion of the window in our room was cracked and covered with duct tape. Not what I expect from a 4-star hotel. 2.) The staff does speak english as many have noted in previous posts, however they are not the friendliest or most outgoing people I have witnessed. We consulted the concierge as we left on Xmas Eve about what dinner options we might have without a reservation. Her exact response was \"good luck\" and pointed us at a couple of restaurants that might have available tables. We didn't expect a miracle (and realize that we were asking for one) but she just seemed to put forth no effort at all to help us. We ended up having a wonderful dinner at Gallatoire's which we ended up at due to our own research. The people who work the bar and breakfast were not much better, certainly all of them could have been nicer (and at times I considered borderline rude). I won't go on much as no one did anything particularly rude, but I wanted to counter the previous posts that said the staff were so exceptionally nice. In their defense, all of the people who worked the front door were really nice and helpful. 3.) Breakfast, I will just say avoid it, at $18 there are tons of better options.

The lobby, restaurant, bar and hallways are among the most impressive in New Orleans, with huge crystal chandeliers, high ceilings, elaborate statuary, and quarries of marble, as well as noteworthy paintings, and rich fabrics. Employees are delightful and welcoming. While name usage wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, every employee with whom I interacted was enthusiastic, friendly, and helpful. As well, it is clear that the staff takes great pride in their workplace. Hotel d\u00c3\u00a9cor will either delight or disappoint. While the over the top decoration works in the public areas, in the guestrooms, these flourishes may be too much. Tasseled valences over the shower curtain, for example, can be offputting to the point of being irritating. That said, the guestrooms are disappointing, in size and d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Unlike modern guestrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe building is over 100 years old\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere is no entry alcove once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come into the room. So the room seems like a bit of a box, and a smallish one at that. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgrand in large spaces\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseems dated and stilted in a guestroom. The armoire eats up much of the room too\u00e2\u20ac\u201da flat screen TV would increase the perception of space a great deal. Bathroom, though nicely finished in marble, is small by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards, and looks as if decorated by a drag queen. There was some wear issues\u00e2\u20ac\u201da badly maintained bathtub, for example\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut overall, housekeeping and engineering staff work to the place looking good. Air conditioning works well. On the rooftop, there is a small though nicely furnished fitness center, as well as a great swimming pool, whirlpool, and sundeck. Great place to spend a sunny day\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut tanners, note: There are only eight chaise lounges around the rather small pool. Overall, service is good, though one day, housekeeping overlooked cleaning our room, and for a luxury hotel, you might expect better name usage. Room service was prompt, but our name wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t used by the order taker or server, and the tray wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picked up for hours. Breakfast was tasty, and room service for three ran about $63, with all of us feeling full. Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is about 6 blocks from the beginning of Bourbon Street, in the area of downtown New Orleans convenient to some office buildings, about halfway between the Mississippi River and the Superdome. While nearby to many attractions, the blocks surrounding the hotel can be a bit desolate on nights and weekends, and based upon local recommendations, caution is advised walking back from the French Quarter after dark. Le Pavillon has many nice added value features. Fitness center usage, wireless internet, and nightly peanut butter sandwiches in the lobby are all complimentary to guests. This is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World, and by comparison, travelers used to the standards of other LHW hotels may find these rooms disappointing. In my opinion, the rooms are in need of renovation and updating, for certain. At full price, this hotel may disappoint given the rooms. I reserved the hotel for $53 a night on Priceline, so all of these amenities were a great value at this price\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough the rather noteworthy low Priceline rate was more likely an indication of the New Orleans hotel market and the slow Labor Day weekend than the state of the room product. Finally, New Orleans looks great, at least in the areas tourists are most likely to visit. The only evidence of Katrina damage in the downtown and French Quarter areas are a few boarded up hotels (neither the Hyatt nor the Fairmont have reopened) and a lack of tourism at times, included a once thriving riverfront mall\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRiverwalk--that is now 50% vacant and ill-visited. In some ways, the city is more appealing than ever for travelers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand hotel values abound. If you have any doubt about a visit to New Orleans, look beyond them and by all means, make the trip. Not only will you have a wonderful time here, but nothing would hasten the recovery of this unique city than a return to previous tourism levels. . .", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Iberia", "Title": "\u201cBest Ever\u201d", "Author": "lsu-since-60", "ReviewID": "UR8537747", "Content": "Simply put, best hotel we've ever stayed at in New Orleans.

It is full of Antiques, Antique Art, Chandeliers, Marble and Beautiful Rugs. I have a lifelong interest in Antiques, and I decided to stay in The Victorian Suite, because the pictues of it were so Lovely. It was Fabulous. The Antiques were Beautiful, and the two handcarved Rosewood beds are fit for a King and a Queen. The Food is Yummy. The Lounge is Lovely and furnishes Entertainment. The rooftop Pool is truly---off the hook----. There are a couple of Private cabanas available for those who get lucky. I was able to get one. The Pool is very, very clean, as is the entire Pool and sundeck area. I also stayed in The Mallard Suite. It has an Antique Canopy Bed and a Jacuzzi. It is smallish, but very well-appointed. The Jacuzzi was clean and in perfect working order. The Marble in the bathrooms at Le Pavillon is Gorgeous. The Wallpaper, Bedding, Drapes, and Rugs are all very nice looking. I appreciate Beauty, and I also like Beautiful Behavior. The staff at Le Pavillon is Incredibly Nice, and they know what they are doing. The place runs like a well-oiled machine. I always got my Food done correctly and served at the right temperature. The cleanliness was Very Good, and this is coming from a Nurse folks, so it isn't easy to pass my inspection. You cannot expect to stay in a 100 year old place that it full of Antiques and not find some dust here or there. I will take a spot of dust in return for what Massive Luxury Le Pavillon offers. This is a five star Hotel and it is a One Of A Kind On This Earth. I give them my official \"A\" in all categories.

Hands-down a Best Buy. The superb concierges have outstanding knowlege, recommendations, and character: when my girlfriend left thousands of dollars of jewelry on the nightstand while we rushed to a swamp tour, the Chief Concierge offered personally to retrieve it and lock it in the hotel safe, genuinely-happy to have saved us hours of worry. Our four days zipped by as we explored tours and trips, the best of which were the ones recommended by the Concierges: our guide on the Cajun Honey Island swamp tour was outstanding, as was the small boat he used; our walking-tour guide in the Garden District and cemetary was the best I have ever experienced, the jazz club the concierge recommended on Frenchman's Street was first-rate. These were truly the most knowledgeable and thoughtful concierges I have had the pleasure of dealing with at any hotel anywhere, ever. They weren't trip-sellers; they were educated, articulate people who knew and loved their city and knew exactly how to help you experience it. Only a hotel that has been there for one hundred years could so consistently do everything right, including doing all sorts of little things to let you know how much they appreciate your business. When a bulb burned out in the bathroom, maintenance was there literally in five minutes. Room service was quick and delicious, a cut above what you'd find at a chain hotel. Every staff member we encountered was warm, willing, and acted like it was his or her privilege to help us, offering zillions of little kindnesses during our trip. Maid service was quick and flawless, and the extensive, quality selection of toiletries and such harkened back to when hotels really wanted you to have and use this stuff, and bring it home to spread their name. The PB&J tradition is inspired, and is a nice opportunity to share raves about this gem with other guests. Cabs are readily-available, but the location makes walking to the Riverwalk, the Aquarium, the Quarter and the CBD all very easy. I should say that the hotel does not offer stuffy, oh-so-refined-but-just-a-little-condescending service like some high-end chains.

Drinks served in the hotel lounge were well mixed and comparable to the pricing. The much-advertised peanut butter and jelly sandwich with hot chocolate and milk offering at 10:00PM was interesting. We walked into the lobby at 10:10PM to find 80% of the sandwiches gone, only skim milk served in pint cartons available, and barely enough hot chocolate in the container to pour one drink.

I visited in March of 2005, on my first visit to New Orleans. To be fair, it should be stated that I checked in at the Pavillon after more than a week at the Maison Orleans, arguably one of the finest hotels in the south, owned and operated by the adjacent Ritz-Carlton. Nonetheless, I had been seduced by the gorgeous website and with a few more days in the city, I was hopeful that the Pavillon would offer a change of scenery. It certainly did. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exterior is nothing less than breathtaking, especially at night, standing in sharp contrast to the relatively modern buildings of the business district. Unfortunately, the exterior is where my happy memories of this hotel end. The lobby might be described as grand if one has little experience with grandeur. Yes, there was plenty of marble and several chandeliers, yet these things alone do not define luxury. Close inspection of nearly any area reveals the use of inexpensive materials and a lack of attention to detail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tell-tale signs of a renovation budget spread painfully thin. It may have been thought charming and no doubt economical to retain the ancient and disarming check-in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the installation of a more modern and welcoming reception area would have proven a much wiser investment. The check-in process itself was a decidedly dull affair, not unlike a visit to the DMV, with the agent exhibiting only the barest modicum of hospitality. Carrying my own bags to my room, the elevator opened onto a poorly-lit and dingy hallway which had apparently been overlooked during the recent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multi-million dollar renovations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd touted in the brochures. Gaudy murals could not hide the obvious neglect. Not surprisingly, the room itself perfectly met each of my already low expectations. Red and green jewel tones dominated the d\u00c3\u00a9cor revealing an even more futile attempt at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old-world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd opulence. The Pavillon has obviously yet to learn the lesson that true luxury cannot be mass-produced. Try to imagine a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Treasures from Old New Orleans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hour on the Home Shopping Network, and you will begin to understand my disappointment. The staff was as attentive and professional as one might expect them to be without proper training. Most seemed to go about their duties with an air of awkward confusion; inoffensive, but not terribly helpful. I recall some bewilderment regarding my ability to take breakfast in the main dining room. Some misguided young couple had apparently decided to celebrate the happiest day of their lives in that room, and paying guests were being re-routed to the bar area for breakfast in preparation for the event. I and several other guests naturally refused, and remained in limbo for about fifteen minutes before finally being allowed inside. The staff in the dining room were friendly, though subject to a rather unorthodox ranking system which provided some servers with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153assistants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; a situation I have yet to encounter again. I would note however, that the breakfast itself was quite good. My only consolation for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pavillon Affair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (as I now refer to it) is that my overall experience in the beautiful Crescent City was enjoyable due to the warm, welcoming and wonderful people who live there. In terms of accommodations, the city is filled with any number of delightful hotels and B&B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

We booked our package with Expedia and we were concerned that we might not be treated as well as someone who booked with the hotel directly. I called two weeks in advance to order flowers for my sweetie. Ms. Lou, the Concierge, said that we should order them the day before arrival to ensure that everything went smoothly. She took down my number and called me by 9 a.m. just as promised. When we arrived, after a \"thrilling\" cab ride from the airport (If you get an ex professional soccer player from Guatamala buckle up FAST), we were greeted by the valet and escorted into the hotel to the reception desk. We were upgraded from a room with a queen bed to a king bed! Our bell hop, Naheed, always greeted us and asked us how our stay was going. He was a wealth of information for things to do off the beaten path and for great local restaurants to eat at. The room was beautifully decorated and had adequate space for our needs. Yes the bathroom counter was small but I easily was able to put my belongings there without worry. Besides exactly how much time do you really spend in the bathroom? The safe was locked so we couldn't use it right away so we called down to the front desk and within a minute someone was at our door to fix it for us. We then went to have a cocktail before our balmy walk to dinner. Definitely request turndown service. Not only will you get a bedtime snack and a bottle of Abita Springs water (great for after an evening of a few too many cocktails)j but the maid will replace any used towels and replenish your shampoo, body lotion, and soap. Also make sure to have the late evening snack of PB & J's from 10 - 11. There were plenty of fixings to make your own sandwich plus fruit, superb hot chocolate, and ice cold milk. The Concierge, Ms. Lou was always helpful and can get you a reservation anywhere in town even on short notice! Also speak with any of the valets or bell hops they also have a good pulse on the city and can steer you in the right direction for a funky little place to eat or listen to wonderful music. My husband is a triatha-geek. So he found the workout facilities adequate for his needs. The pantry in the workout room is always stocked with sports drinks, bottled water and fresh fruit. Even if you don't use the facility you can go in for a snack in the m iddle of the afternoon to hold you over until dinner. The pool was small still refreshing after a hot day. YES, the elevators are slow but try to remember that the hotel was built in 1907. I'm sure part of what attracted to you to the property is the fact it is a historic property. If you want a faster elevator go to one of the newer chain hotels in the city. YES, it is a short walk to the Quarter but I would much rather take a walk to the Quarter or $5 cab ride so I could get a good nights sleep and not hear drunk people pounding up and down the halls all night long. Or to hear police sirens on Canal. It is a beautifully restored hotel whos charm is not only in the decor but the people who work there. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. p.s. The suite near room 728 has one of Napoleon Bonaparte's marble bathtubs.

The concierge gave us the name of a clinic, along with the name and number of the hotel's house doctor. Their house doctor came to our room and checked out our son. What a luxury it was to have a doctor come to us, especially in an unfamiliar city! The room service staff was always friendly and prompt. Our son likes warm milk, and when we called to order it, the staff took extra steps to ensure that the milk arrived at our room at the right temperature! The restaurant staff went out of their way to make our meals there comfortable, as did all the staff. One day, our son was crying in the restaurant, so we strolled him around the lobby. We returned to the restaurant when, all of a sudden, a staff member who saw us in the lobby appeared with a big, blue balloon! We immediately had a happy, smiling child! Every night around 10 p.m., the hotel has a tradition of serving peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. It's beautifully done on silver platters, with various kinds of bread, jellies, peanut butter, hot chocolate, milk, coffee, etc. It's a fun thing to look forward to in the evening!

Upon check-in we were informed our standard room was being upgraded at no extra charge to a suite. Again my wife was WOWed by the generousity of the Hotel. As the Bellman took our luggage and escorted us up to the 7th floor he gave us a nice overview of the history and layout of the Hotel. During the elevator ride up he asked us if we were on our honeymoon which we answered no but maybe you could count it as a second honeymoon because of the cruise. He said our suite is usually referred to as the Honeymoon Suite. As we came to the end of the hallway with my wife continually scanning the doors to find our room she realized the large set of french doors at the end were actually the entry into our suite, the Napoleon Suite. The word suite does not do justice to majesty and expansive this mini-apartment has to offer. The suite has its own foyer, sitting area w/fireplace, huge king size canopy bed w/curtains, magnificent bath area. I highly suggest and encourage everyone to stay at this beautiful hotel. The people enhance the feel and quality of your stay even as much as the hotel itself. We'll stay here everytime we come to New Orleans.

I was told that I would be unable to obtain a key since the machine was not working and that the bellman would have to let me into my room. I found the room dark and musty, in fact an aerosol can sat next to the bed, along with miscellaneous cleaning supplies. There was a partially consumed bottle of soda in the fridge and the lock on the bathroom door was broken. After having an in-room spa treatment, I attempted to log onto the internet to find that the wireless signal was too weak to log onto, and the LAN connection was not working properly.

Upon our arrival, there was no doorman to greet us, open the door and assist with our luggage. We were greeted in a tepid manner by the front desk. We were made to wear annoying, lime green bracelets that we had to keep on for four days (it reminded me of some wild college spring break when bracelets are handed out at bars for unlimited drinks). Our room was rather small; the space provided did not create the feeling of luxury that the hotel boasted. Our toiletries were crammed onto the sink. We wanted to have a small meal at the Gallery Lounge, and the waiter was very delayed in his service. We were seated, and we waited to place our order while the waiter ran around serving others. He completely forgot about us, especially when a busload of tourists arrived to order drinks at the bar. It was obvious that he was not going to get around to taking our orders anytime soon, so we left our table completely disturbed by the experience, and we could not help but let it negatively affect our perception of the hotel--where was the hospitality that Le Pavillon boasted of?????? AND, he had the nerve to look annoyed when he finally noticed us leaving our table. Also, I was inquiring about the times when luncheon was being served at the front desk, and the woman was very brusque about her response, and once again I felt completely put off by the lack of hospitality. Housekeeping was not very thorough in cleaning the rooms--I found an apple core underneath the bed that housekeeping had failed to clean up! Two factors do stand out with regards to a more positive experience at this hotel--the late night snack hour and the turn down service.

This hotel is really nice, it is an Historic Hotel. Once you enter this Hotel you know you are going to be pampered there. The service was great, from minute one everybody was very helpful. The decor was really nice (painted ceilling in the bedroom, Grand Chandelier in the loby, mirror and gold everywhere, Marble in the bathrooms). One little thing is: we had a room with a king bed and the room was just a bit small for this size bed, but we still had room to move around. The room was very quiet, we never heard anything from the surrounding rooms (even if they were occupied) or the street (we were on the 3rd floor). We ate at the Crystal room (the hotel restaurant) for breakfast and had their special buffet. The food was very tasty and I wiil advise you to try their Bananas Foster Waffles. We enjoyed their roof top Heated pool and Hot tub everyday. Even the decor around these area was great (statues, gas lamp at nigth). We did not use their gym, but we checked it ou, it look very well equiped and with good quality cardio machines and lot of free weigths. They offer water, Gatorade, towel at the gym it was surrounded with windows on the roof of the hotel, there were a good ligth in it. We also loved the free HIGH SPEED INTERNET and the snack of hot chocolate, peanut butter and jelly snadwiches, fruits, milk, orange juice, cookies they have available at 10:00 pm. The location of the hotel is great, in between the French Quarter (5-10 minutes walk) and the garden district, only one block from St Charles trolley line and two blocks from Canal street trolley line. It is a great location to discover what New Orleans has to offer. We also felt secure walking in the area even at nigth. There is also all around the hotel plenty of nice restaurants, like Herbsaint (my Favorite). We'll go back there on my next trip to New Orleans.

The room service was quick and I recommend the gumbo which was delicious...but don't make the mistake of coming in around 3:30 a.m. and ordering the pepperoni pizza. I was very disappointed with the pizza, but I guess at that time of the night who's up rolling fresh dough and slicing fresh meat and veggies? The pool area was beautiful, nice and breezy, the jacuzzi was awesome and the cabana area was very relaxing.

Check-in was painless and courteous, which was great since I hadn't slept a wink the night before and had a migraine to boot from the tension. As soon as I checked into the room I was rewarded by cleanliness and old world charm. I even took pictures of the ceilings, which sported crown moldings and hand-painted flowers! Within minutes of checking in I relaxed to the point of having my migraine vanish. I had made reservations for x-mas dinner that evening at the restaurant inside the hotel. The only glitch was when I showed up at the restaurant and they didn't have my name down for the reservation, even though I had confirmed it upon arrival. Despite this, Christmas Dinner was spectacular. Also, the hotel didn't have a shuttle (free or otherwise) to the French Quarter. However, that was fine with me since I didn't enjoy the drinking scene so much. Even though I left generous tips daily for the maid service, they got chintzy with the bath products after my second day. Also, my room was right up against the stairwell, not a good idea if you don't want to hear the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early morning hall traffic. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT for complaints. I don't stay at a hotel anymore without checking out reviews at www.tripadvisor.com. Only Le Pavillon was one of the few with so many (well-deserved) positive reviews. That's the main reason I stayed there. I felt perfectly safe there and in the surrounding neighborhood, which I often walked around, as far as The French Quarter. The walk is great because you get to experience the little artsy shops along the way. Right around the corner of hotel I found a little convenience store and a Subway. There is also a lovely casino about 10 blocks away. Two charming points of the hotel were: the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with hot cocoa in the lobby every evening. However, somewhere on the internet site it said it was at midnight. It was more like at 10:00 p.m. (can't remember now). One late night I came in from the cold to the welcoming, warm, and beautifully decorated x-mas lobby with this little feast laid out so beautifully. Charming!!! To boot, this little soir\u00c3\u00a9e was free and it also provided an opportunity to meet fellow guests (met some cool people there). Another charming, albeit strange claim to fame of this hotel (for you \"sensitives\" out there) is that the hotel is one of the most haunted in New Orleans. Trust me, it was, but nothing scary, just another aspect of its charm! The bonus of my trip (thanks to the shuttle driver from the airport) was the Egyptian traveling antiquities exhibition at the New Orleans Museum of Art (www.noma.org) called \"The Quest for Immortality\". It ended Feb. 2004, but this museum is well worth exploring, they have a rich and diversified collection from all over the world. This was the highlight of my trip. Don't worry, I did manage to get a drink in at the oldest bar, LaFitte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (sp?) Blacksmith's Shop the day of departure. I was happily surprised with the turndown service. The room was cleaned, bed turned down with two generous, delectable cookies, soft music, and a dimmed spotlight bathing the painting above the bed, a relaxing prelude to a good night's sleep.

Le Pavillion was gorgous! Doormen, Bellman, conceirge, outstanding decor..... Our room was one with bay windows. There was a raised, decorated ceiling with a ceiling fan. The beds were covered with beautiful decorative pillows. The furnishings, linens and room decor were quite fancy. The bathroom was unbelievable! Wonderful shower, beautiful sink, and black tile floors. They even provide comfortable bath robes to use in the room. My children were extremely impressed! We all went for a midnight swim in the rooftop pool. It was an experience I think my kids will always remember fondly. We walked to the French Quarter. It is not far and we never felt threatened, but it may be safer to take a taxi. Our children are 3, 10 and 13. Valet parking is required and I believe it cost $25 per night. It is billed directly to the room. Most, if not all hotels in the French quarter area charge for parking. The cheapest hotel parking we saw was $10. We got the beautiful room at Le Pavillion for such a great price that we could afford to park too. Note: I recommend you have your own sodas, etc. They are quite pricey at the hotel. **We found that there is complementary bottled water, sport drinks, and fruit in the workout room.

If you pay full price for their tower rooms, I think this hotel needs to improve. The location is perfect, on the beach. The hotel is renovated and our room was nice. The bathroom has some rust on the ceiling, but still was in pretty good shape. The service was one of the poorest I have seen. The from desk people are quite apathetic. All we got at check in was a photocopy (on a .5 page) of the map of the property. There was no acknowledgment of this being our honeymoon. It is important to realize that while the towers are nonsmoking, this is NOT a not smoking property. You would smell the cigarette smoke if you walk around, on the beach or around the cottages. When we checked in we only had a bath towel. Next day we got other towels but in general there seems to be no rule about what kind and how many. One day we came back to out room to find it OPEN. The housekeeping did not close it after cleaning. The next day, they cleaned the room next door from 9 pm till 10 pm. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is a Luau on site. That means that you will hear it, from 6 pm till about 8:30 pm. Every day, except Saturday. But even on the off day, the hotel had a movie on the lawn so basically you cannot hear your thoughts if you are in the room. They also seem to be stingy with the beach towels. They only give you 2 and they close early, so you'll have to carry them around till next day, because you have to recover your \"tower card\". I suggest bringing in your own towels.

We liked the place a lot. Nice decor, free upgrade. We loved the pool and the beach. And even though there's no spa, we could walk to the one in the strip mall nearby. I actually, we liked the local coffee shop there, too. So, based on last year's visit, this place earned four stars. But that was then, and this is now. This is a story of a screwed up reservation. Now, I won't blame that completely on the Royal Lahaina. In fact, my guess is they deserve only a fraction of the blame. Here's the deal. I used my accumulated points from my credit card to book three nights. I called the night before my flight and the morning of my flight. Both time the person at the hotel front desk said, \"the agent hasn't sent the reservation yet. But if you have a piece of paper that says you have a room, we will find you one.\" Should I worry, \"absolutely not. We'll find you a room.\" I did have the printed reservation receipt, and I had several assurances from the credit card travel advisor that the booking would be sent over. Well, it wasn't. Now, that's bad, but that's not what upset me. When I got to the hotel, the lady at the gate had called to someone from the front desk. She met me outside the lobby with a guard at her side. Really? Your message is, \"Don't even step foot in the lobby?\" She said se had been looked into the situation since I called in the morning. A third party (hotel beds.com) had booked me at a resort in Makena, nearly an hour away. There's nothing she would do. What about, \"I'll find you a room?\" Nope. Don't even come in. Where's the aloha. So maybe it was the fault of hotel beds.com. Frankly, I suspect the hotel bumped me because there was a HUGE conference in town. But, again, it's not about that. It's about how I was treated. I asked about the resort where I was rebooked. She said disparagingly, \"The beach is nothing like this. It's way over by the Aquarium. I don't know anything about that area. I don't think it's nearly as nice as this.\" Well, Makena isn't by the aquarium. It's far from there. If she spent any time on the island, she would know that. So she was being dishonest. And, it turned out, the Makena Beach Resort was fantastic . . . great beach and pool . . . wonderful brunch daily, great views, super friendly staff a great fitness room, and a fantastic spa service. So why bad mouth it? Couldn't she have said, \"I know you must be disappointed. But I called ahead to the Makena Resort. Here's what I found out. I think you'll really like it.\" Would that have been so hard? Or . . . \"I know I promised you a room. I spoke out of turn. I sincerely apologize, Here's a coupon for a drink or coffee or a coconut (or something). Next time you come here, we'll give you a fantastic upgrade. We value your business.

Nothing pretty, nothing fun. Just a rectangle. But the view beyond the rectangle pool, the lush green grounds and the location far outweigh the un-imaginative pool. I would definitely recommend this resort to a friend/family member. Keep in mind that despite Lahaina being in the name of the resort, it is not in \"downtown\" Lahaina (where many of the tourist attractions/shops/restaurants are).

I have no idea what they are talking about, because the Royal Lahaina Resort is just amazing! Everyone I encountered at the hotel as well, enjoyed their stay. As soon as you drive into the resort you are greeted by extremely friendly staff and welcomed to the hotel warmly. Bell hops were readily available to help you with your luggage and watch over it as you checked in. The front desk staff were attentive, friendly and very helpful. The only issue we ran into was when we booked with the hotel, we had requested two double beds but received one king sized bed. They did quickly apologize and did the best they could to fix the issue. We would have had to wait a day to change rooms, so we decided to just stay with the room we had. When we arrived to our room, I was very happy with what we got. The room was stunning and had amazing Hawaiin detail put into it. One thing I must comment on is how comfortable the bed was!! I instantly fell asleep! We had an ocean front view room and was so happy we decided to go with it. View was incredible! We not only had a spectacular view of the ocean but got to see a lot of the cottages and pools. Bathroom is simple but very nice, and the rooms are very very clean! I will though warn some of you about the ocean front rooms in the main tower. If you like your peace in the evening, or like to sleep early, do request an ocean front room higher up. We were located on the third floor and every evening heard the music from the live singer in the restaurant. Personally, I loved it but some may not. The resort was spotless, you always saw staff cleaning daily and all day! Maid service was 10/10! Our maids were timely and even came to prepare our bed in the evening for us and gave us fresh clean towels for the night. One thing that amazed me as well, was how honest the maids were. My aunt wanted to tip our maids (not necessary, optional). By accident she pulled out a higher bill amount then she wanted and the maid was quick to say that it was too much and she couldn't take that amount of money. It really impressed me! Both pools were great, not huge but not tiny either. One pool is located infront of the restaurant in the main tower and the other just steps away infront of the beach. My aunt and myself prefered the pool by the beach because it had the best sunlight, as the other pool had sun blocked for a portion of the day by the main tower. The staff at the beach activity center are great and always friendly. You can either use the free lounge chairs or for $30 a day you can rent a cabana. We rented a cabana because they were higher (my aunt has a bad knee and can not sit too low) and it also provided great shade for when it got too hot. Beach. What can I say?! It was gorgeous! Kanapali beach is one of the top beaches and now I know why. I didn't get to swim too often because the waters were rough, but it was just stunning. Standing from the beach and even the pool area you could spot the whales as well. Whale watching was just amazing and is a must do if you are there during the time they migrate to the area. The restaurant in the main tower exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed it very much! Never got a bad meal there and the prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes. There is also a decent selection of food to choose from for breakfast and dinner. We didn't do it every day, but the breakfast buffet is very well worth the price! Lots of selection to chose from. For lunch/dinner my recommendation is either the Kahuna salad or steak sandwich. Both delicious!! We never ate the Basil Tomatoes restaurant as we never heard great things about it from others on the resort. We heard that either the food was luke warm or not worth the price. Personally I can't review it as we never ate there, so if you want to try it, they have half price on food between 5 and 6 pm! The Royal Scoop is great if you want just a small simple breakfast or a light sandwich for lunch, and of course sweet treats! Really enjoyed the ice cream from there and amazing bagels! As far as activities go, my aunt and I did the tour of Maui which included going up to Hana, the Luau and seeing a theatrical show in Lahaina called Ulalena. All were well worth the price!! We didn't book with the acitivity place in the front lobby. I found them to be very rude and not helpful. We booked with the Expedia Activity place located near the Royal Scoop just outside the lobby. They were so helpful and found great activities for your comfort level. Go see Julie, she's awesome! A must see is the Luau! Even if you have been to one before, this one was just spectacular! Food was great, drinks was open bar and show was entertaining! Maui trip was so fun and we went to see beauitful areas of the island! Ulalena, a must see! It shows you the history of the Hawaiin people in a beautiful mannor. But definitely check out the Expedia center for things to do and great prices. Over all, I loved the resort! From amazing staff, great vendors in the lobby and just the details in decor, you can not go wrong! I probably could keep writing but then this would be a very long review! No, it's not a hilton or sheraton, but it has the spirit of Hawaii and just a beautiful atmosphere!

Based on the reviews, I was somewhat skeptical. Happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. Our requirements were fairly simple: clean, two beds, air conditioned, ocean outside our room. Royal Lahaina was a great fit. First, the room. We stayed in the Tower in an Ocean Front room. It was very clean. This was my fifth trip to Maui so I know that bugs are part of island life, but I didn't see any in our room, which was good. The beds were very comfy and also clean (no printed bed spreads here.) Storage space in the room was adequate. The mini-fridge was convenient. The bathrooms are small but I wasn't hosting a party in there, so that didn't bother me. The shower was fine. The water pressure wasn't as strong as I have at home, but I have experienced far worse at other hotels. All in all, I'd happily stay here again. Next, the hotel amenities. The lobby/restaurant/pool area is dated. Everything is well maintained but you don't get that \"ahhhhh\" feeling when you walk in. The staff was always friendly - from check in to valet to activities - everyone was pleasant. The restaurant is very convenient. We had breakfast there 4 times and dinner/drinks once. Breakfast buffet for two was $40 but we left full. Dinner (with drinks) was $65 - cheapest dinner we had on this vacation. Service is leisurely. If you're in a hurry, I wouldn't eat here but we weren't in a hurry so it was great. Dinner took forever but the live music and hula dancer filled the time nicely. It was a very relaxing meal. They do have a coffee shop, which is convenient if you're heading out. The pastry/food offerings were limited to banana nut bread, a couple of bagels and a couple of muffins. You may want to keep options in your room. There is also a small convenient store on the grounds, which is handy. There are two pools on the property. They are well maintained but COLD (if they update these, I'd love for them to add a heater.) Both pools have bars in near proximity with complimentary ice water and a variety of yummy beverages. Last but not least - parking. Dear Lord, the parking. I made one attempt to park in those itty bitty parking spots and quickly decided the extra $5/day to valet park is totally worth it. Finally - location. The hotel is on Kaanapali Beach, which is notoriously pretty. It's close to Whaler's Village and a quick drive over to Lahaina. The Kaanapali trolley service is convenient (but I wouldn't rely on it as my sole means of transportation.) The views from our room were stunning. All in all, the hotel was affordable, clean and conveniently located. We certainly got what we paid for and I'd be happy to stay here again. However, when planning your vacation, I think it's about really knowing what your expectations and priorities are. This is not the Westin or Sheraton. It is not grandiose or lavish. If you want marble floors and waterfalls, this is not the place for you and chances are, you'll end up being disappointed. Our top priority was clean with an amazing view.

It is so unfortunate that such a beautiful resort get negatively tarnished by the front reception staff.

Just up the beach to the north is a reef than begins almost at water's edge which offers nearly as good snorkeling for free as you will get on your $60 trip to Molokani. Also, there is good snorkeling just south of the Ryal Lahaina's beach, around the point, where you can also see an occasional giant sea turtle. We stayed in one of the cabins which was very convenient; you literally step out onto the lawn and then the beach; it avoids having to into the hotel and bother with elevators. The room was adequate for 2, a bit tight with two children, but manageable for a week; there is a small but useful deck on the seaward side. Staff was friendly and helpful; the Guest Services people were able to book us an inexpensive rental van that gave us great flexibility for a couple of days; the car rental office is a mile up the road with a free shuttle. NOTE: I wouldnt recommend renting a car for more than a couple of days -- one to go to Hana, one to go to to the top of Haleakala volcano; week rental are long and you don;t really need the car; you can always bus or cab in Lahaina for a fraction of the cost. One reason to visit Lahaina is for meals; we found the hotel restaurant barely passable. We avoided the overpriced buffet breakfast and bought bagels or pastries and fruit at the coffee shop. Basil Tomatoes -- a restaurant about 200 feet from the resort -- is very good; from 5-6pm, their prices are 50% off, an incredible bargain. There are some good restaurants in town that offer reasonable alternatives to the Royal Lahaina.

Our check in story is similar to a review that I read about the resort just prior to our vacation. Upon check in, we were told that the hotel had overbooked and our room in the tower would not be available to the following day. Instead, we would be given a room in one of the cottages. The attendant took us and our luggage to Cottage J, he was very informative about the resort along the way. Upon arriving at Cottage J, I completely understood the negative review written by another writer about the cottages. The cottage was clean, but very dated. I would say late 1970's paint, tiles, decor, etc. the bathrooms looked very old, with broken tiles, sink and toilet stains. In the main area, the two beds were very small, maybe a double or smaller. Being a family of 4, this wasn't going to work for us, plus it wasn't what we booked. Following a discussion with the resort manager, we were immediately moved to a room on the 7th floor of the tower. The renovations that they have done to all rooms in the tower are very nice. A drastic, but very much improved, difference from the cottages. In fact, we so liked them, we upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite on the 10th floor on day two. The suite was gorgeous with amazing ocean views, floor to ceiling, in each room. We absolutely loved it and we're very happy that we upgraded. The master bathroom was very, very large and beautifully appointed. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pillows too. My one suggestion would be to add a hook or two to the bathrooms to hang the robes that are provided. The living area was also quite large with foyer, a wet bar, lots of seating, a pull out couch and a second bathroom with a shower. Our experience at the resort was very good. One big plus about the resort is that it is located about half way on Kaanapali beach and the beach walk is accessible from the hotel in both directions. The beach in front of the Royal Lahina is beautiful. It is wide and very clean. We didn't use the two pools at the hotel, in fact we only saw people in them on two occasions during our stay. I believe that this was because the pools were quite small and cold. The Resort should consider redoing the pools to a more modern resort style pool area during a future renovation. However, with the beach, and other nearby hotel pools, we were able to have a great experience. We did have the opportunity to eat at both restaurants on the resorts grounds and attend the luau too. The lobby restaurant has good food and not too expensive, albeit the service is a little slow. We also had dinner at Basil Tomato Restaurant and absolutely loved it. Great and lively atmosphere, wonderful service and really good Italian food. We would go back there in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, we would not say the same about the luau. It was very crowded and unlike the good luau experiences that I have had in the past. It seemed to be more of a pack them in, sit everyone down immediately, then line everyone up for a mediocre buffet experience. Luckily, the luau performance and dancers were very good and made up for other part of the luau experience. Our only other concern at the hotel was the Internet connection. It was not very good at all. The wireless connection only worked sometimes in the rooms, lobby and guest relations areas. It was not strong and very spotty at best. If this had been a free internet service, I may be more tolerant, however it is $10/day/user. I expect a reliable and strong internet connection at those prices. Overall, our experience at the Royal Lahina was very good. I do think that they should continue to improve the other areas (cottages, pool area, internet) of the resort as they did recently with the tower renovations.

The view was really breath taking and we loved the local decor it had, especially the wooden lanai doors which would let us hear the lull of the ocean waves at night in peace while sleeping.

We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel, after doing lots of research and after reading mixed reviews we were not sure what to expect. We had a fabulous time at this hotel and in Maui. We stayed in room 1206 and it was perfect we had excellent views of the ocean south to black rock, we were on the highest floor so it was nice and quiet, the room was large with plenty of room to spreadout luggage, it was spotlessly clean, and had a super comfortable bed. Our check in was quick, the staff werent rude but werent overly friendly either. We werent offered an upgrade but we didnt expect one either. we booked a partial ocean view room and that is exactly what we got. We got to check in straight away which we appreciated after not having slept for 2 days. Kaanapali Beach is beautiful and at this hotel its nice and quite compared to the other hotels further south. The day we arrived it was Halloween so once we were all checked in we went to Front Street in Lahaina town centre to watch the parade and see all the costumes. We dont celebrate halloween in Australia like it so it was a novelty to see everyone dressed up and having a fun time. The hotel had a shuttle to Lahaina for $6 per person which was excellent. I can highly reccommend hiring a car. The activities desk organised this for us, as we didnt book prior to arriving, the hire car company came and picked us up from the hotel which was great. We got Valet parking which I would also get again because it saved us having to worry about parking. The activities desk staff were really helpful and answered any questions we had, they organised a couple of things for us like deep sea fishing charter etc but most other things we organised ourselves either before we left home from Australia or when we got there. We can also highly recommend the blue hawaiian helicopters we had a flight and it was absolutely breathtaking what you get to see that you wouldnt normally is unbelievable, worth the $500 australian dollars.we also did a day trip to Paia and had lunch at mamas fish house we can also reccommend here for lunch or dinner the food was fabulous and location was beautiful. We drove part of the hana highway but ran out of time to do it all. We went to Whalers village quite a bit for dinner it was an easy 10 minute walk or if you were feeling lazy you could get the free shuttle/trolley ($1 tip) We especially loved the hula grill at Whalers for afternoon cocktails and we had dinner here 2 nights out of our 5, we ate at the barefoot bar and also in the restaurant, the have amazing fish tacos and mai Tais good relaxing entertainment. The Royal Lahaina had a bare foot bar also and happy hour was great it was wonderful to sit and relax while the sunset and just chillout after a day exploring. We ate breakfast at the hotel once and that was enough it was ok nothing to rave about we just had bacon & eggs. We had dinner at the resort aswell and that was really good. Lahaina town centre (we drove) had heaps to do eat and drink and was only 5-10 minutes south, mmmm Ululanis shaved ice was delicious. The highlight for us from the hotel was the snokeling we hired equipment from bobs which is a bit further north at Napili and was heaps cheaper than the resort we were able to swim right off the beach and snokel at black rock which was amazing we saw sea turtles and a couple of manta rays and lots of different fish. we did a day trip to Molikini and the snokeling was better off the beach at the hotel than at the crater. Unfortunately we found Dukes restaurant on our very last day it is a short 10 minute walk north of the Royal Lahaina and had excellent breakfast, it would have been great to try for sunset drinks and dinner. The Royal Lahaina isnt 5 star but it is so relaxing and not one of the big chain hotels, it doesnt have a big resort pool but its on one of the most beautiful beachs and that to me beats a pool anyday (we didnt use the pool once).

The parking is a little tough because they often have luau's going on, so sometimes if you get back later, you could have some difficulty finding a spot.

I wanted to stay in a \"hawaiian\" hotel instead of a big chain and let my travel agent convince me to stay at the Royal Lahaina before I did all my research. I read review after review for a month, most of them terrible and finally made myself stop reading. I have good news - there was no reason to be terrified. But that doesn't mean I would stay there again. I am fairly low maintenance with hotels on vacation since I rarely stay in the room. If you get a good deal here, it's probably worth it but do not pay top dollar for this resort when there are so many good ones in the area. Pros: - The grounds are very pretty. Great location, great beach, great sunset views. - The valets and bell hops are very nice and helpful. - I enjoyed the pineapple flavored water and cooling down towels they keep in the lobby. - The tower rooms were very nice, I enjoyed the balcony and the minimalist look. - We didn't mind the parking and the price. There are bigger spots in the back of the lot that requires you to walk about 100 feet more, which I guess is why people were complaining. We're also from NYC where you have to walk alot. - The champagne for our anniversary was a very nice gesture. Cons: - The receptionists were nice enough, but sleazy. I don't know if they do it on their own or if they are trained that way. We had booked the anniversary special when we booked our room and I called the week before we left to confirm (spoke to their corporate office, which was great). Their office confirmed that I had a room on a top floor in the tower with a garden view. They told me if available, they would upgrade me upon arrival to a partial ocean view. When we checked in the receptionist told us that she had no more partial ocean views and for $100 a night she could upgrade me to an ocean view room. I declined. She then said that she would give me the great deal of $50 a night. I declined. And then, magically, a partial ocean view room happened to open up. How convenient is that? - Trying to charge you for a late check out and missing key and towel cards? Come on. - Maid service was AWFUL. I always tip the maid a lot in hotels but ours was super lazy. We had the same lipstick stained wine glasses in our room night after night, no matter how many times I left them in the sink to be replaced. She didn't clean anything or replace the cosmetic products. I found stained sheets on our 2nd night and had to get someone to change them. You're a resort, step it up. - It's impossible to shower without the water leaking everywhere. When they built the new fancy showers, they left 2 cracks in the door that water shoots from all over the floor and bathroom. - Last - I was very suprised to learn that there was no gym. I didn't even think to ask about it in this day and age. Every hotel has at least a couple of barbells and a treadmill for their guests. Nothing doing here. When I asked about it, they told us we could join the neighborhood gym for the low rate of $55 per week. Ha. I know some people don't like to work out in Hawaii but some of us do and this was the first place I've encountered without gym access.

There are certain expenses to be aware of, but if it's not a surprise to you, it shouldn't put a damper on things. Parking is expensive; it's a few dollars more to go for the valet, and I think it's worth the cost to leave it up to them to squeeze into the tiny spaces. The breakfast buffet is also quite pricey, but the views from the restaurant are amazing if you get a seat outside. Go early or there will be a line. Or why not order room service; it is actually less expensive in most cases. Get a room in the tower and eat on your lanai; it is very nice. If you want to save money in the morning, the Royal Scoop cafe on site offers bagels and things, or their gift shop/store sells fruit, sandwiches, and beverages. We absolutely love the stretch of beach it's on, and it's less crowded than further down Ka'anapali. To me, it makes it worth every penny. Be sure to buy or bring your own towels while you're there, as the Beach Activities Center only let's you have two at a time and closes at five. Grab a seat at the bar there to watch the sunset and listen to some free entertainment from a guitarist and hula dancer. The bartenders that were there on our most recent visit were superb, and you get faster refills if your sitting at the bar rather than other parts of the restaurant (and beware, those Mai Tai's are strong!). The Whalers Village is five minutes away, and you can hop on a free trolley to get there, and Lahaina is just a bit further down, which is full of cool shops and great restaurants. We don't leave West Maui much while we're there but it's nice having a rental car to explore the other parts of the island and get to activities. There is also an Expedia Local Expert there to book activities, as well as two guest relations counters (one in the lobby and one just outside of it) so you won't be short of things to do while you there. They were offering yoga and pilates in the mornings during our stay (which I meant to check out, but never did...). Also you can print your boarding passes and get on the Internet for free in the guest relations office, so don't pay the hefty Internet fee while you're there each day because you're supposed to be getting away from it all!

Our vacation to Maui was a dream come true. Checking in was quick and the staff was always friendly and helpful. Because we were honeymooners we received an upgrade of an ocean view room (we booked a partial view) and a complimentary bottle of champagne (which was much needed after a long day of traveling). We were on the 11th floor facing the cottages and golf course. The views were incredible at all hours of day. Our room was spacious, very clean and we had plenty of towels and pillows. The bed and bedding were very luxurious and super comfortable. The fridge in the room was nice for drinks and snacks. The grounds and beach are fantastic with amazing views of the sunset. We added the breakfast buffet and are glad we did. We filled up on that each morning, ate a snack for lunch and went out for dinner. The luau at RLR was very nice. The food was delicious, the show was great and the mai tais and blue hawaiians kept on coming. We also ate at the hotel restaurant a few times. Our meals were excellent (I espeically liked the fish tacos and onion rings) and the service great. The ice cream at the Royal Scoop was almost as good as the ice cream we get in Wisconsin :) The pineapple water in the lobby was very refreshing after a day on the beach. We rented a car for two of our seven day stay. We booked a Dollar Rent A Car through RLR. A shuttle from the rental company took us to and from the resort when we picked up and dropped off the car. It worked great for us! An awesome thing about RLR is there is no resort fee (that is unless you rent a car in which it is $10/day to park). We talked with some people that stayed at the Sheraton who were suprised with over $400 in resort fees when checking out. No thanks. Royal Lahaina Resort is on the quiet side of Kaanapali Beach which made it very relaxing and enjoyable.We were so comfortable here that it truly felt like our home for the week.

I was thrilled to be bringing friends that were new to Maui to share our experience and I did nothing but rave about how fantastic the Royal Lahaina Hotel had been for us year after year. In terms of culture, Cleanliness and location you can't beat it. It's a great bang for your buck for a hotel right on Kaanapali beach. The restaurant is great, the Royal scoop coffee shop was a life saver and serves amazing fresh brewed Kona Coffee, snacks and a light breakfast and the beach?....unbelievable. I am very saddened for the first time to be writing a negative review of this hotel because somewhere on Trip Advisor there is 2 more written by me for the same hotel for past visits. Here are the negatives that we experienced this time around which will definately change my selection of future accomodations on Maui. Booking- We got a fairly good rate and the reservations agent was happy to match any rate that was found on other travel sites which was a great thing. Please note when booking through the hotel that they take a minimum payment of three nights as a deposit. Check in- So disappointing! We unfortunately had late check in due to our flight, and let me tell you the night shift staff are probably curled up under the front desk until you ring the bell for service. We attempted to check into the room and gave the agent our credit card. Where she pre-authorized the entire 10 night stay. To our embarassment and shock, neither my or my husbands credit card was able to be processed. Being a little odd that both cards didn't work especially because we had cleared it for the trip, we were immediately panicked that our trip was about to begin with no credit cards working. The agent didn't seem to sympathize, she didn't even attempt to re-swipe or tell us what the machine was saying. For the sake of being exhausted, our friends lent us their card for the pre-authorization so we could finally just check into our rooms. When we contacted both of our banks the next day to see what the issue was. They immediately asked where we were because there had been a $3000 charge (not pre-authorization)attempted to be processed on both of our Visa's. (Our room total for 10 nights was $1400) 10 night experience: the first couple of days our room cleanliness was quite good, ample amount of towels, soaps etc. so we started to leave gratuity on our bed before heading to the beach....for some reason, this worked the opposite way, as soon as we started to leave cash tips the service plumeted substantially. We were less a towel every day, no shampoo was replaced and empty bottles were left and our bed looked thrown together. I complained the next day and they promptly came to our room with extra towels, shampoo etc. but I had never had this type of experience before. Check out: We checked out after our 10 night stay and the front desk agent asked if we would like to leave our charges on the card provided at check in. We immediately said \"NO!\" and for them to please use our credit card instead so our friend wouldn't be charged. The agent graciously smiled, took our card asked for our ID as we overlooked our invoice which seemed good (although our friends had extra charges on their's, so please double check if you stay here) all was well and we departed. After our return: our friend just called to tell us that our entire bill was charged to HIS credit card. So what the front desk did with our card and id is beyond me. So in addition to this review which again I am sad to be writing I am about to contact them directly and discuss our experience. I am very disappointed, and I'm not sure why this hotel has changed so dramatically in just over a year.

It was beautiful. The staff was very helpful giving us places to go see and things to do. We went to several beaches around Maui and I thought the Kaanapali Beach at our resort was the best. The water is so clear and blue, great for swimming and snorkeling (go over to the Sheraton on the other side of black rock. It is just a short walk from the hotel- the snorkeling is great there) It is cheap to rent snorkel gear at the Royal Lahaina too, it only cost us $30pp for the whole week. The beach was never crowded either which is a huge plus. When we got there, they upgraded our room to a Deluxe Ocean View which was beautiful. They have live music every night and usually they have a hula dancer too at the restaurant there. It is very relaxed in the restaurant, a lot of the time we sat there and had drinks in our swimsuits. We had a package that included the Royal Lahaina Luau and a Sunset dinner cruise. My husband and I weren't impressed with the Luau, I would try a different one. Food was NOT good at all. The Sunset dinner cruise is a MUST. You can book it right there at the resort and the crew is amazing. Very funny staff, made our drinks strong (its an open bar) and the dinner was really good too. I would rent a car so you can go exploring around the island. Big Beach and Fleming Beach are both worth going to. Fleming is just 5-10 min up the road. Big Beach is about 20-30 minutes the opposite way in Makenna. You can boogie board at either of those beaches. Honolua Bay was also a great place to snorkel and its only about 10 minutes away from the hotel too. If your looking for souvenirs go to the little store right down from Subway in a stripmall in Lahaina on the main road (I cant remember the name of it, I think something Liquidation??) Or there is a K-Mart by the airport that is a lot cheaper too. I would suggest stopping there for sunblock, bottled water, etc because the closer you get to the hotel areas the most $ it is.

We were in the new \"Towers\" where I think about 95% of the rooms have their own decks with ocean views! The friendly valets unloaded our jeep and took care of all our luggage. Check in was seamless and we were taken right to our beautifully decorated room with marble bath (separate shower and toilet which I love!) and gorgeous ocean view! Our king bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in and we had plenty of fluffy soft pillows. A huge flat screen TV (not that we watched it much) kept us abreast of football (those Hawaiians are crazy about their college football teams--almost every other channel was a sports channel!). Enough of the room! The staff at this place are really the best. I travel frequently and the folks at this place really seem to genuinely care about making you keep a smile on your face! They are so friendly! There is a bar on the ground floor that is open to the outside and you can sit and sip a Pai Lai (an absolutely amazing type of pina colada they serve inside a real pineapple!) and gaze out to the ocean right in front of you! We ate lunch in the restaurant by the pool every day and honestly, we never had a bad dish. The roasted red pepper soup was to die for and so were the fish tacos! There is a luau nightly on property so you don't need to travel to be treated to that and the show was great! The special wild pig they serve was soooooo good! But the truly best thing about this place was the location. It is on the ABSOLUTE BEST stretch of beach you can find in all of Maui called the Kanapali beach (and we also stayed in Hana, Waikiki, and Wailea during this trip and visited other beaches around Maui via our jeep so we know what we're talking about here!). The ocean is so crystal clear you can see your toes even when you are up to your neck! The clarity and aqua blue color amazing! And there are no crowds like Wailea can get at times. We love to snorkel and only about a 100 foot walk north from this hotel is great snorkeling! We bought our own gear rather than rent it at the beach shack so we snorkeled in every day. I swam alongside a sea turtle daily at this spot and tons of beautiful fish including my new fav the Bird Wrasse! Lots of humuhumu fish too which are sweet! The sand is soft and everything is so clean and clear. We also walked the beach path to get to Black Rock, another great snorkeling site where, at high tide, we saw the largest sea turtle ever! That site is on the Sheraton side of the rock but is only a 5 minute walk. At night we drove a mile south to Whalers Village or 3 miles south to Lahaina to eat at numerous different restaurants, Lahaina Grill being the best memory for food and service! But you don't need a car because the hotel provides a trolley service for free that takes you to down to Whaler's Village where there is lots of shopping and two fun restaurants with nightly live music! The other great thing about this hotel is that there is a separate \"family pool\" where the kids were, so it was nice to lounge around the bigger pool without getting splashed, hearing yelling, etc. The poolside bar service was awesome too. The only reason I gave the lesser rating for cleanliness was the doors that front the hotel by the beach restaurant. The wood along the bottoms was corroded and they really should be replaced so it looks nicer. Otherwise I would highly recommend this hotel. We think it's the best deal going on Maui. Oh, and if you like golf, it is literally right next door. For $85 you get a cart and get to play on a beautifully maintained course with stunning ocean views. What a trip!

We then came to the Royal Lahaina in Maui for 6 nights. We were on a budget and chose the resort based on our financial restrictions. During our research, our travel agent told us about the \"Maui Dream Package\" offered by Costco. We aren't members of Costco so I don't know how we got the package but we did. It included free breakfast (brunch), 2 mai tai's a day (one for each of us), free valet parking, a free luau at their show, free sunset dinner cruise, and $250 foot and beverage credit (including booze......well liquor, but still how can you complain?). The room was nicely appointed and was in what I believed was a Hawaiian style. The furniture was dark, walls light, and linens were white in color. It was reasonable size and the bed was comfortable. The resort had a pool next to the ocean. It was an older pool and not as nice as others, but it's placement made up for it. There was a row of shrubs that lined the beach blocking the view from the pool when you were in the pool, but standing outside the pool you were graced with a view of Lanai and Molokai that were unparalleled. The beach was pretty good for Hawaii as beaches there aren't deep, but this beach was appreciably deep and offered plenty of room to lay out a towel. The main floor of the resort was very clean and offered a coffee shop, restaurant, and other resort offices. There are a ton of tennis courts and a tennis stadium. There is also a golf course adjacent to the course. Good restaurants and shopping is within walking distance to the Whaler's Village. Our FIRST room was on the 9th floor, opposite the elevator. This wouldn't be an issue if there was better sound proofing on the room door and in the hallways. The roar of other guests was so loud that we couldn't sleep past 5 AM. The cleaning staff started vacuuming the hallway before 8AM. We immediately had a bad taste in our mouths. We asked for a room change and in two days time they put us on the 7th floor, closer to the ocean. This was quieter and we did get better sleep. The buffet in the morning was the quality of a lesser hotel. The food choices never changed, were very limited, and there were no fresh made omelets. This got old real quick. The service was prompt and friendly to help in balancing off the less than average food. The resort was on a local trolley circuit which was free. It also was a 5 minute drive from Lahaina, a nice shopping area as well.

Upon arrival, we went to the reception to see if we were able to move into a room in the tower, however, an upgrade was very pricey and the women on reception were not very helpful, so they weren't particularly bothered when we were querying this. A little later we decided to go back and politely asked for the upgrade, but the last room had been gone and another wouldn't have been available for four days, and we were leaving then, so just had to put up with it. Being British, we do not like to complain, but on reflection, we really should have, as this was meant to be a very good hotel. All the communication made with reception staff was conducted politely on our behalf, and yet they were still very unhelpful and blase. The problem with the garden rooms were that they were VERY outdated, and generally quite dull. The bathroom was very basic, and again, outdated, in dire need of a makeover! Also, I wouldn't feel very safe staying in these rooms if I were travelling alone, as they were completely separate from the main building and involved walking through gardens (as the room name suggests) in the night. Also, the safe in the room failed to work on a number of occassions, and we had to call someone out to keep fixing it (he was very nice though!).

If Hotel Management is reading this review then i want to make a statement here that \" I did not ask it for my pleasue but i needed it for my 1 year old baby\" My Tips - Always book tower rooms and try to get rooms on higher floors. Also never spend extra mony on Oceanfron Room as they become really Dark during night and you cannot see anything. Overall stay was good but will think twice before returning just because of the Microwave issue i had", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAfter Reading TA Reviews, Thought Royal Lahaina was right for us.\u201d", "Author": "tennis105", "ReviewID": "UR118131675", "Content": "After reading about many of the Ka'anapali/Lahaina resorts, we decided that Royal Lahaina actually had the most activities and conveniences for a family with 2 teens. When we were checking in, we asked for a room with the least possibility of mold. My teen is allergic to mold (and a host of other things). We were given a 2 queen on the 11th floor of the tower, looking over the golf course toward the ocean. Really lovely. We were able to let the kids eat where they wanted (sign charges to the room) from the bar, restaurant, ice cream shop or convenience store. The prices and selection were good. Not Costco prices but considering the time and hassle it saved us, priced just right. Sandwiches were just under $6.00 and a small bottle of water, $1.00. Though the pools are small, they were not crowded. The beach was easy to walk onto and walk off of (foot and body showers located in all the convenient locations). The beach there is really good for snorkeling, swimming and jumping waves. Early morning and late afternoon strolls are pleasant. The sand is clean and fine. The jet ski rental is down at the Sheraton, a little walk away and the dinner cruises leave from this beach. Room was actually very well designed for space (for 4 people). We did not feel cramped and there was a place for everything. Loved the Hawaiian boat decorating theme and the quality of the sliding slat-shade doors and cabinetry. The only part of our stay that was a negative was that the shower glass doors did not seal completely, allowing water to accumulate on the floor. We used up a lot of our towels keeping the floor dry at the shower door.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Spring Island", "Title": "\u201cNice Property, Great location\u201d", "Author": "ebeamish", "ReviewID": "UR118093677", "Content": "We honeymooned on Maui and stayed at the Royal Lahaina.

The lenghty cab ride between properties was actually a great way to see the Shoreline..... and upon driving up to the Royal Lahaina; I definitely had a good feeling about the place. It had a very appealing RETRO look to it; a Resort right out of a Brat Pack movie; or Brady Bunch in Hawaii episode. (I really mean this in a positive way) The resort recently had an expensive remodel and the rooms as a result are quite nicely done. The lobby maintains more of a 1970's feel, but this isnt a bad thing....a simple but beautiful pool, surrounded by nicely manicured grounds boast the most spectacular view I saw anywhere on the island...... So heres the BAD.... check in; quite a hassle. I booked a Partial Ocean View Room, with the expectation of an upgrade to an ocean view. Little did I know when I arrived that the upgraded room to Ocean view, meant that I saw a gimpse of the ocean if I could just try to avoid looking directly at the roof that the room faced. Asked to be moved to a better view; I was actually put into a worse room. Apparently; there are 5 levels of Ocean view; a clever bit of marketing that gets you to have to drop quite a bit more cash in order to get the view you might expect. I travel a lot on business; and generally find that most hotels will do their best to accomondate you if youre polite and friendly..... The polite and friendly approach didnt work on either of the very surly front desk personell I encountered; and finally I had to resort to demanding to see the manager when suddenly a nicer room became unavailable. (they were sold out 5 minutes before that) Annoying; but after 90minutes, the check in fiasco was resolved; and I found myself appreciating this beautiful hotel for its simple yet authentic hawaiian feel.

We liked the tower room, although we learned the difference between \"ocean view\" and \"ocean FRONT\" when we arrived & didn't feel like paying $120 extra per night for what we thought we were getting in the first place. You can see the ocean from our room if you go out on the lanai and lean over the railing. I guess that counts as a view. The view we do have is of the cottages and golf course, which is still nice. At least we're not on the side that has a view of the parking lot. We enjoyed our stay here for the most part. The tower rooms are nice. I've heard the cottages are in need of updating.

It is the same exact thing every day, the eggs are disgusting & watery, pre-cooked heat-n-serve sausages, French toast and waffles that sit out all morning, corned beef hash from a can. There are flies everywhere- all over the food. You wait in a line to be seated and the hostess who seats you seems lost half the time.

We took a snorkelling/sailing trip to Molokini with Paragon - the only company who actually sail - others tell you \"some sailing\" which means they put up a small sail whilst still using engine power. Paragon has a smaller catamaran and on the way back they actually put up both sails and turn off the power - which was a wonderful way to get back to the harbor. They had a great location at Molokini and it was much nicer to snorkel with only 30 people vs the big circus you see off the larger boats - and they don't make you wear a flotation device or stay near the boat - much better for experienced snorkellers.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, great beach...shame about the pool!\u201d", "Author": "NWLondonHoneymooners", "ReviewID": "UR117276314", "Content": "Stayed at the Royal Lahaina in August.

I had a top of the line oceanfront suite with wrap around terrace and still paid 375 less then the actual room rate. Now as to the review which addresses upgrades for free for some and not for others. This was solved by simply asking when offered the upgrade why its not a free offer as some are. The answer made perfect sense. The lower end rooms of the hotel are sold out whith just some suites remaining. So put a guest in there from the lower end room for a small fee because you wont sell it for the full price and now u have a lower end room to re sell. At slower times if available the hotel is happy to upgrade. The property was right on the beach and the hotel will work out a deal on a weekly chair rental but you have to ask can you do better then that. The staff was attentive and friendly.

We were treated like royalties during our stay. Here is a review of all the aspects that made us fall in love with this hotel. Location and view: The resort is directly located on the Kaanapali beach.The beach is literally 10 feet away from the Ocean Terrace Restaurant and the pool. We had a beautiful view of the ocean from our room as well as a view of Lanai and Molokai islands. Size: The Royal Lahaina is the smallest of the resorts located on the Kanaapali strip. It is surrounded by names like the Hyatt and the Sheraton. We chose to stay at the Royal Lahaina because we wanted a local Hawaiian hotel and were not disappointed with our decision. Being smaller than the other resorts, guests do not have to walk 10-15 minutes in order to get to the restaurant, the pool or the beach. Everything is a few steps away. But one must not be fooled by its size, the Royal Lahaina still offered us the luxury and comfort guests expect to get from 4/5-star hotels in Maui but also gave us the feeling of a true hawaiian hotel. Rooms: Our room was very clean and comfortable. We had booked an Ocean View room and were upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View upon arrival because we were honeymooners. We were on the 12th floor and had an amazing view. Each room has its own private balcony with a few chairs and a table. Food: The resort offers many options for food. Our favorite was the Ocean Terrace Restaurant which was located right off the beach. The service we got at the restaurant was outstanding and the food was delicious. We had purchased the Royal Experience Package which included daily buffet breakfast and a daily 18$ credit per person for dinner at the Ocean Terrace. I highly suggest this package since only a few meals on the menu are valued at more than 18$. There is nightly live music at the restaurant. During our stay, we looked forward to hearing Josh Sumibcay each night on his guitar. He made us fall in love with his music. The buffet breakfast offered a variety of choices to pick from included fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, pancakes, french toast, danishes, cereal and exotic juices. The manager was always there overlooking everything. Price: Having done a lot of hotel shopping in order to find the best place to spend our honeymoon, we found that the Royal Lahaina offered the best price-quality value. We paid much less than we would have if we had stayed at the neighboring resorts. I highly suggest the Royal Experience Package and the Paradise Value Package (which includes daily parking and free Mai Tai's). Service: Everyone working at this hotel was very friendly and helpful. - We had decided to go up the Haleakala volcano to watch the sunrise, and the lady at the reception warned us it will be very cold and lent us blankets which came in very handy! - Also, on our last morning, we had to leave very early to catch the plane. The restaurant manager prepared breakfast boxes to take with us and to eat on our way to the airport. - A stand with fresh and cold pineapple water is always set up at the main entrance of the hotel and is so greatly appreciated on those hot days! If you are looking to stay at a major American chain resort like the Hyatt or the Sheraton, you should avoid the Royal Lahaina.

This hotel is sufficient....it just depends on what you are looking for out of your vacation and your hotel. To us, this definitely wasn't a place we would want to stay at all day and relax. However, we didn't go to Maui to just sit by the beach so it was fine for us as a place to sleep at night. We did read the reviews prior to selecting this hotel. I would agree with some of the more recent reviews (that weren't posted when we booked) and if I had seen those reviews we would NOT have stayed here. Based on reviews, we called the day before we left to \"secure\" a room in the tower as we were arriving late in the evening and didn't want a problem. The room was ocean view on the 7th floor. Room was adequate and clean. The beds were comfortable (which is always a plus). We stayed 7 nights. It seemed that although bed linens were changed the room wasn't very clean by the end of our stay. The staff definitely does NOT clean the deck or the furniture out there so beware of putting any food you want to eat on the little table. I agree with another reviewer and would not list this hotel as a \"resort\". The two pools are very small and cold and as many other reviewers mentioned, there is not enough seating and what they have is broken and uncomfortable. There is not any poolside food service. There is a restaurant and small bar area not far away from the pool where you can go and get food and bring it back to your seat. Not that this is a problem but people should be aware in case they want that level of service. Wasn't an issue for us as we were out everyday at the beautiful beaches on the island but would be a problem for someone that wanted to hang out poolside. We had a $250.00 credit for food. We were so excited thinking we would have some great meals with seafood, but unfortunately for us, the food was just \"O.K\". True that we have great restaurants near our home so maybe our taste buds are spoiled?? Things like the burger, sliders, fries etc are a safe bet but anything outside of the \"bar\" food just wasn't very good. Same with drinks....not great quality. Out on the island there are much better choices (in Pa'ia- The Fish Market is great...so is the gelato place there). So, if you are out and about, don't rush back!! Finally, the staff. As a few others have mentioned be prepared for many rude people that will not go out of their way to help you or if they do, the look on their face says it all!! We had no idea the staff was like this and we were totally unprepared. After talking with a few other guests at the hotel and a server in the bar area, it seems many people are having the same experience. We primarily encountered this with the front desk staff. That being said, the valet guys were great! We would not visit this hotel again. This was our fist time on the island. It was fine for the vacation we had planned this time around however, if we had known, there are many other beautiful and amazing places to stay. The Kapalua area is beautiful and South Maui seemed to have several great resorts with great pools etc.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cSo friendly!\u201d", "Author": "ion-horia", "ReviewID": "UR116589141", "Content": "Great hotel, great service, beautiful grounds.

We also noticed it was much more quiet and less populated than the other resorts on Kaanapali Beach and we enjoyed several romantic strolls along the shore. Our package included daily breakfast and a $250 food credit in the hotel restaurant. I was a little nervous about the food given other reviews, but we found the breakfast buffet to be quite adequate and we also enjoyed several dinners. The food was very good and the wait staff were quite attentive and polite. There are a few areas that could be improved upon. First of all, although the rooms were quite clean, the daily housekeeping was spotty. We had to call the front desk for washcloths and towels 3 times because they left us either none or only one or two. On one occasion, we had to wait well over an hour for some washcloths. I suspect they ran out and had to wash some! There were a few times when hotel staff did not seem as attentive or responsive as they could have been but they were quite busy and perhaps a bit frazzled. Finally, I have read other reviews which mention the fire alarm going off in the middle of the night. This happened to us on our first night and I have to say it scared the heck out of me! Especially when we were making our way down a hot, crowded staircase and stopped moving around the 7th floor.

For my birthday last month I decided to splure a little and do a \"staycation\" and spend the weekend at the Royal Lahaina. I had a lovely weekend enjoying the ocean front room at the Royal Lahaina, the luau, and breakfast buffet, plus walking the hiking trails in Kapalua. What I have found is when people have bad things to say on websites like this is because their expectations were not met. In many cases when they book their vacation they go solely on the price of a property. In the case of the Royal Lahaina it is NOT a 5 star hotel or even a 4 star hotel and it doesn't market itself as such. It is a moderate property with likewise services and qualities. To expect a moderate property to have a deluxe pool like the Hyatt or a luxury property like the Fairmont Kealani or Grand Wailea is not fair to yourself or the property. The pros of the Royal Lahaina would be the ocean front rooms! If you are looking for an ocean front room you can't get much closer to the water than this property. One of the reason for this is the zoning laws have changed here in Maui since this property was built. Nowadays the hotels have to be set back much further from the water. Okay, I know I probably lost a few of my readers by actually explaining why this is the way it is, but that is the reason why. The parking spots are small and there is no bathtub (shower only with the exception of the suites), but the price is good, the location is wonderful and the staff are friendly. For the money you can't beat the Royal Lahaina if you are looking for a moderate priced hotel in Maui.

Stayed on the upper level of cottage C, which was oceanfront. Read a lot of mixed reviews about the cottages so I was a bit concerned. The room was nicer than I expected. We had four people (two adults and two teen age children) and it was very roomy, with two full baths, which was very convenient. This is not the Four Seasons, but it was comfortable and clean and had a full kitchen as well. I loved the ambiance of a casual beach cottage that is literally just steps from the lightly populated beach. The hotel is next to a golf course that is basically right on the ocean, so there seem to be fewer beach going guests per square foot than at other beachfront hotels in the area. This is a real plus in my view. Plus there is good snorkelling at the Black Rock just next to the hotel. The beach sand is nice and the surf was very calm the week we spent there. The hotel restaurant is kind of average. Had the Ahi Tuna sandwich for lunch a couple of times and it was perfectly done and flavorful. The restaurant really seemed more like a lunch place, not a dinner place. The wedding reception for my daughter was in the backyard of Cottage F (which has a small pool, hot tub and waterfall pool) and was very nicely done and the food was much better than the food at the Hotel restaurant in my opinion. The hotel wedding planner did an excellent job and everything ran smoothly. 36 people attended the reception. My daughter and her husband had a beautiful one bedroom oceanfront suite on the ninth floor of the hotel. The furnishings here were excellent top quality furnishings worthy of the Wynn in Las Vegas or a Four Seasons. My twenty something sons stayed in a room that was a garden view regular hotel home. Furnishings were very nice here as well and totally up to date. So my advice is, if you are looking for a modern well furnished hotel room, stay in the Tower.

At one time we even took our laptop down to the reception to get them to connect but this wasnt successful either, then finally we gave up. The Barefoot Bar was a gem, ordering a drink and waiting for the sunset to happen was blissful. The place, although next to the adult pool, was quiet and tranquil.

My first morning here, I woke up to the sound of the ocean, and the wind going through the palm trees, and tropical birds singing outside my balcony. The private beach was awesome. It was so quiet and spacious, not like the public ones. When I told the person at the gear rental shack that I was active duty military, he gave me free snorkel gear for the whole week, and told me all the best places to go to see tropical fish.

The continental breakfast was a bit of a rip off. $20 per person. It's all you can eat, but since the area is integrated with the outdoors, there's nothing to keep the fruit flies from swarming over the buffet or birds from swooping down and eating your food the moment your back is turned. I had birds eat my food every time I got up for more juice. Also, $10/day for parking. Also, $10/day for wireless internet, which is run through a third party, and receives an extremely weak signal throughout most of the hotel.

After a very smooth flight we took the shuttle to the rental car offices where we picked up our car that was included in our \"Royal Experience\" package. With neither of us being in Maui before we took our time and took in a few sights before heading to the resort. We called the front desk to make sure that a later check in woud be okay. We were greeted with a friendy voice who reassured us that it would not be a problem. Finally arriving at the resort we were again greeted by very welcoming and friendly staff. (After reading several reviews we were a bit curious about this experience and were grateful for the nice woman who checked us in. Even offering us pineapple water). She then told us congratulations and offered us an upgrade without us prompting. We left to go take a look at our \"upgrade\" and was pleasantly surprised at the view the room offered. An ocean view that we knew we would be very happy with! Sunsets from here were amazing as well as a few sunrises that we watched from the balcony. It was a lot of fun that first night to take a stroll on the sandy beach that is just steps away! Before we left the room a \"Welcome\" bottle of champagne was there waiting and we took that down to the beach with us and consumed it while walking under the stars planning our vacation. We are somewhat adventurous in our travels not staying at the resorts/hotels for much of the day. Using them more as a base and a place to sleep. However on this trip we found ourselves more at ease and taking full advantage of the amenities offered at this resort. Our package also included breakfast every morning and we found ourselves enjoying this quite a bit as it served as a great base to last until dinner. Our package also included their luau and a sunset dinner cruise! Both were what we expected and feel that it was of good value. We met a lot of good people at both and it was nice to run into them at times the rest of the week. The pools were very nice looking however when we're this close to the beach we find ourselves not staying pool side. Snorkeling on this side of the island was very good to us! In fact probably the best snorkeling either of us has ever done! Just a short walk north on the beach is some of the best corral and fish! No need to waste time driving all over the island. It's right out the front door. Another thing that we were curious about was the parking. Again after reading several reviews we were expecting the worst and again it feels good to report that yes at times the parking is full but NEVER did we find a time where we couldn't park. And if there was any walking done it was welcomed after spending a few hours in the car driving particularily after \"The Road to Hana\". Our package also included a \"drink\" of the day at the bar and they make them right at this place. It was nice to walk up to the bar and have a nice, cold drink waiting. The bartenders are great and treat you like you are best friends. All in all we ended up being very comfortable and happy with picking the Royal Lahaina.

Would have been nice to have beach chairs or rentals. The grounds of the hotel were well-kept. The Luau at the hotel was well worth the $150 for 2 people. We drove to Wailea (45 minutes away) and the Road to Hana (few hours away) - both trips are well worth it! We also walked to the Sheraton hotel to snorkel at Black Rock - this hotel was amazing and we would definitely stay there next time if we stayed in Lahaina again. When I spend so much money on a flight to Hawaii (from where we live flights are $1,000) I want to stay in a nice hotel when I get there. Royal Lahaina was inexpensive - but very basic and plain. Location is good but that's pretty much it. All Hawaiin beaches are public so you can walk to ANY beach you want!

So, you can actually sit on the balcony and not get blown away. When we checked in I mentioned that it was our 50th anniversary and was hoping that they might upgrade us to an oceanfront room. No such luck. However, she did offer us a complimentary bottle of champaign. Since we don't care for champaign, I asked for a bottle of wine, and that was not available. So, she offered a bottle of mineral water which I said would be o.k. Later that day they brought us a bottle of champaign which we left in the room for the housekeeper. Hope she enjoyed it. Our only room complaints were with the bathroom which lacked of a tub/shower and also the dim lighting in the sink & dressing area. You could \"almost\" see what you were doing while shaving. The only meals we ate at the hotel was at the $20 breakfast buffet. The food selection was great. Their dinner selections are very limited and pricey, so lunch and dinner was in the town of Lahaina. The parking facilities at this hotel are ridiculous. The spaces are so small that it can be very difficult to get your car parked and then you may not be able to open the doors far enough to get in or out. The parking situation is made even worse in the evenings when people from other hotels show up for their luau and show. So, my advice is to get a small rental car that will have a better chance of fitting the parking stall. In spite of the above issues, it is still a great place to stay in Maui.

It has a small kitchen area with stove top, oven and fridge, an eating area, sitting area, bedroom plus a large outdoor lounge area.

I'll start with the positives: Staff is friendly and very knowledgable: a young woman at the front desk gave us some really good tips for shopping and she was pretty funny too! The resort is big: I like being able to go around a property and not have to run into the same people over and over again. Lu'au on site: I think it's the Royal Lahaina Lu'au. We didnt go to this one but it seemed pretty popular. Recently renovated rooms: the room was lovely with a big bed, flat screen, sliding wood doors (gorgeous!) leading to the balcony; just lovely woodwork throughout the room. Lemonade/Flavored water in the lobby (gratis!): I found this to be welcoming considering how hot it can be on any given day in Hawai'i. Conveniently located: Right off of the main road, shops located on property, additional shops within walking distance and the Lahaina Cannery Mall within a short 5 min drive. Room was spacious: self explanatory - I like a lot of space in my room. Comfy Bed - Large and plush, just like I like it! Bath products - I absolutely LOVE coconut and its hard to find coconut scented products that arent mixed with other fragrances but Royal Lahaina has it! Negatives: Check-in: even with the front desk fully staffed it took about 15 mins. Maybe I'm overly spoiled by the Marriott but I thought this was a bit excessive. Parking: NIGHTMARE, especially if there's an event going on at the hotel and even worse if the Lu'au is happening too. Valet parking is right in the front and guest self parking is in the back (3 lots - one of which is FAR back). To me it makes more sense for employees to have to go further than guests. Bathroom: I thoroughly confused by how small the shower/toilet area is. I mean it's TINY. 2 people couldnt fit in the shower, there was no tub and maybe about 2-3 feet between the closed shower door and the toilet; VERY odd. Elevators: There were 2 or 3 elevator banks with about 4 elevators in each but they were pretty small so if you factor in people with their luggage, you might end up waiting quite a bit. Thankfully there was a staff member who showed us how close we were to the stairs and since we were only on the 3rd floor, we walked most of the time. I cannot speak to the restaurant, pool or beach since we were only there for one night.

When I got in line to \"check in,\" there were maybe 10 people in front of us. And yet my wife and I waited in line for close to an hour in a stuffy, crowded lobby with no AC. I began to sweat profusely while my wife sat in a chair with our bags. When it was our turn, the staff were incredibly rude, indifferent, and clearly hated their lives (which is too bad, but it's not my problem). I asked the woman helping me a couple questions and she ignored me both times; her body language was also apathetic. She eventually told us our room wasn't quite ready yet (even though it was almost check-in time) and she suggested we \"stand to the side\" so she can remember to give us our room keys(!). We did, and when I realized she'd never see us again, I asked another woman for our room keys and she acted very annoyed. After some time, i asked her again, and again she shut me down, so I asked another clerk walking by, and she immediately got the keys for me. Again: It's clear they hate their jobs/lives. Just not a welcoming atmosphere. Our room had a \"balcony\" that (literally) overlooked satellite dishes. Why they put a balcony on that room is beyond me. The room itself was ok--just a little small. Parking is $10/night in a first/come-first/serve parking lot that REALLY fills up at night. Again, why/how am I being charged to park HERE? Thankfully, we only stayed two nights (we stayed somewhere else earlier that week). When we checked out, the woman at the front desk printed off a sheet of paper and told me to sign on the bottom. No formal \"x\" with a line. I just awkwardly signed in a big empty white space. Now, do I need an \"x\" line to make my Hawaii trip memorable? No--but it's a little thing that speaks much to the cheapness of the place. A receipt from Walmart will have an \"x\" and a formal area for you to sign. So, really. As long as you've already been saving up money to fly to Hawaii, look around to see what else you can get if you splurge a bit. The one redeeming quality to this place is its close proximity to downtown Lahaina.

And they had everything you needed to where if you just wanted to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery or go snorkeling or do whatever you want, they had it.

We couldn't have asked for a better weather or ocean conditions. There was hardly any humidity, the sun felt nice and the ocean waves were quite calm, unlike the winter months. One amazing thing about the location of this resort during the month of April, is that the sun sets right in between the Moloka'i and Lana'i islands. This resort is located right at the center of these two islands in the distance. This combination makes up for beautiful Hawai'ian sunsets. The hotel beach itself is not very crowded, because its located on the right side of the black rock (which is more crowded because of its fame). So you have a very beautiful, secluded part of the famous Kaanapali beach to yourself. All the big brand hotels, namely Sheraton, Westin, Hyatt are on the left side of the black rock. The ocean walk there is very crowded, mainly because of these huge hotels and also because of the numerous restaurants and the whaler's village. But the Royal Lahaina side of the Kaanapali beach is much more secluded and less commercialized. So, full marks to the location. As for the hotel, It's definitely not a high end hotel, i.e. it doesnt have the extra frills like the luxury hotels do. I visited all the luxury hotels in Maui and this resort does not compare with the rest as far as the swimming pools, the resort ambiance and the amenities are concerned. But hey, a normal garden view room of those hotels would cost you the same as the ocean view room in Royal Lahaina, and the view from this resort is second to none. Royal lahaina has two small swimming pools, no waterfalls or bars in the pool like other hotels.....so families with small kids should definitely consider other hotels. The pool at Wailea resort is the best. Also, Sheraton, Westin, Mariott, Hyatt...all have huge pools with waterfalls and slides. I think kids would enjoy those more. But for people like me, who'd rather be in the ocean than the pool, who love to watch the Hawaiian sunsets, who love beautiful beaches with not much crowd...then this resort is just right for you. Also, the mai tais at the resort bar are only $4 during the happy hours (which last until 6 in the evening). As for the room, I stayed in the partial ocean view room in the tower. I'd rather stay in the ocean view, but it was a bit expensive for me. Maybe next time:) The rooms were clean and well maintained. A little small for liking, but you get what you pay for (and in Maui, you have to pay a lot to get luxury) . I stayed away from the cottage rooms, as I read a lot of negative reviews about them. The parking space was cramped. I rented an Impala and that really made it worse. Rent a small car if you can. It will save you on the gas and the parking hassles. P.S.: I did not like the $10 charge for parking, but I've heard that all Maui hotels do that. The shops in the hotel compound were nice. Do make a visit. So, all and all... a good experience at this hotel. No bad memories at all.

We booked a great Expedia package that included an Aloha Garden Saver Room. Ricardo checked us in upon arrival, and upgraded us to a partial ocean view! He was wonderful - ended up checking us out too, and was friendly and efficient. The room was great - decorated in Hawaiian decor. Very comfortable bed and I loved the bathroom! The balcony or lanai was wonderful - we enjoyed breakfast out there almost every morning while enjoying the bright sun and peaceful breeze, overlooking the ocean. We had a good view of the garden cottages too, and I'll definitely consider them for the next time. They looked very well kept, and were scattered about the tropical lawns. Much better than what I had pictured based on what I read on here. The hotel is located right on the beach. I'm so happy I picked this particular hotel because it is just slightly north of black rock, and seems to be on the \"quieter\" and less kiddy side of black rock. The other side of Kaanapali Beach is definitely the more family oriented side. So this was perfect for our honeymoon. The beach is beautiful. Sandy and clear waters. We enjoyed the Luau at the hotel one night, and it was a lot of fun! The drinks were plentiful, as was the food. The entertainment was great, and we got a good last minute rate through the Expedia Travel Office located on property. We ate at the restaurant twice - once for the breakfast buffet and once for dinner. Everything was very tasty, and not too badly priced (for Maui). It was wonderful being able to see whales playing off shore. The location was amazing - just a quick 5 minute drive to Whaler's Village (or take the free Kaanapali Trolley), and a 10 minute drive to Lahaina. It always felt so nice to come \"home\" to the Royal Lahaina and have the person at the guard shack wave and welcome us home. All of the staff was very friendly. They even went out of their way to retrieve my bikini top the day of checkout since it had blown off of the balcony overnight. The snorkeling off of Black Rock was great - we snorkeled one side one day and the other side the other day. Both times, we saw an abundance of fish and some sea turtles. The only slight negative I can find with this hotel is the parking. The spaces are pretty small. And it does get parked up due to the luau, so you sometimes have to park much further away. This hotel was perfect - a wonderful Hawaiian feel with the hospitality. It was beautiful too. Everything we hoped for for our honeymoon. I have to admit - I work in the hotel industry in Arizona, and so badly wanted to stay at the Royal Lahaina that I checked out the job openings one day, lol. Just dreaming I suppose.

It's only a short drive from the Royal Lahaina to Front Street in Lahainatown, where we spent most of our evenings. We never ate at the hotel, but the food looked good. There is also a great reasonably-priced cafe at the Fairway Shops right down the street that is good for breakfast and box lunches (CJ's). We also went to the the luau at the Royal Lahaina.

The property is clean, small, but nice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not nearly as fancy or luxurious as the Westin or Sheraton. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously one of the older hotels along the strip, it's very basic, no spa or fitness center, boring pool, go to the beach instead. The beach is great, soft golden sand, just steps from the hotel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a paved beachfront walk that winds around the hotels and stretches probably about 4-5 miles, very popular in the morning with walkers and runners. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 20 minute walk to the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village, a decent-sized shopping mall, or there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a free shuttle from the hotel. The food in the Royal Ocean lounge/restaurant is excellent. The breakfast buffet has your standard fare: eggs, bacon, pastries, fruit, cereal, oatmeal, etc. The buffet doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open until 7am, so if you have an early tour, you can either get something from the Royal Scoop or ask guest services the night before to notify the restaurant about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcto-go\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 buffet (we did that once and they were a little disorganized, but it worked out in the end). The restaurant service at breakfast/lunch is a bit indifferent. Maritas, whom we had several times did not seem happy to be there and had to be asked repeatedly to fill up our waters. Bar service and dinner was better. Enjoy some drinks at the Barefoot Bar with Raffi, try his version of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPut the Lime in Don Coconut\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and enjoy the beautiful view. The Royal Scoop is an ice cream/coffee shop that opens at 6am, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the shave ice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not real shave ice, go to the town of Lahaina to Annie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Ululani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the good stuff. Front desk and valet parking service was always friendly. There is a small fridge in your room, so you might want to stop at a store on your way from the airport and pick up some bottled water. Room was clean, bathroom area a bit small, but functional. The room could definitely use more places to hang wet stuff up, though. Included in the Costco package was the luau. If you read the awesome Maui Revealed guidebook (the blue one), it rates the luau as really bad. We thought it was ok, with the exception of half the seats face the setting sun, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty uncomfortable until the sun goes down. Bring a hat, just in case. The meats and purple sweet potatoes were good, the salads were just ok, desserts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. The drinks are watery, but you can go up to the bar and ask for additional rum to pour in your mai tai. Frozen drinks are not included in the price though, I think those were $15 with free refills. The show is good, lots of energy and some humor. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been to a luau before and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at the hotel, it might be worth the $70 for a ticket. One thing I was disappointed in was when I reserved the package, I noted that we were staying there for our 10th anniversary. There was no acknowledgement of that from the hotel, I was expecting/hoping for a little something, bottle of cheap champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, or at least a congratulatory card. One would think that Hawaiian hotels would be very used to people celebrating and would have a standard practice to acknowledge. This may validate other posters' comments about lack of aloha or poor front desk service.

So, I booked a snorkel trip to Maui for a couple of days through Expedia. I researched hotels and the Royal Lahaina seemed like a good choice. I was wrong. I drove on to the property about 3pm and checked with the gate guard. He confirmed that I did have a reservation and then asked if I was traveling alone. I said that I was and he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I thought that was rather unprofessional. I pulled into the tiny and crowed parking lot and pulled out my backpack. Since I was only staying for one night and leaving in the morning for an early snorkel trip, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to haul in all of my luggage. I checked into the hotel about 3pm. The front desk was chaotic and several guests seemed to be having problems with their keys or reservations. When it was my turn the front desk clerk told me that they had two reservations in my name and in order to make sure I was checked into the correct one, I needed my confirmation number. My name isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t common so I asked if he could check the address and he said no that I needed the confirmation number. So I had to walk back to the car and find my Expedia print out and go back to the lobby and wait again. I told the front desk clerk that I was only visiting Maui for one day and would really like a nice room. I was then checked into cottage R, which is about as far away from the beach, pool and main building as possible and still be on the property. After a hike, I keyed into (using metal keys on the first floor, as a single woman traveling alone, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like being on the ground floor and only a certain type of hotel still uses metal keys.) I walked into a dilapidated, stuffy room that smelled like mildew. It looked nothing like the photos on their website. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even set my backpack down; I walked to the phone and called the front desk. The front desk clerk told me that for an upgrade fee, I could be put in a deluxe ocean view room. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in that horrible room, so I agree to pay the extortion fee and I hiked back to the front desk. I waited in line again, signed the upgrade agreement and was given keys to the new room. I went upstairs and tried to key in to my room. The key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. So I went back to the front desk, waited in line again and was given new keys. I went upstairs, again and tried to key in to my room. The key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, again. So I went back to the front desk, waited in line, again, and was given new keys made with a different key machine and this time a bellman escorted me up to my room (he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask me if I needed help with my back pack, just walked up with me) and then condescendingly show me how to use the key. I travel a lot and believe in tipping for good service, he could have earned a tip if he had been just a little bit helpful. I was finally in my room and it took only an hour. This room was lovely, clean and comfortable. I love Asian themed decoration and the shuttered lanai. The bath amenities are generous with a fresh coconut scent. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the coffee maker because they left powdered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whitener\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than liquid dairy cream. Ick. I left the property for dinner, when I returned the guest parking lot was full because of the luau guests, so I had to park in the back parking lot and then once again, hike to the hotel. The parking spaces are very small. After sunset, I went to sleep because it had been a long day and I had to be up at 5am for my snorkel trip. I had been asleep for about 30 minutes when the front desk called to tell me that I had an envelope waiting for me. It was advertising from the Expedia concierge and really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a reason to call after 9pm. Not once during this experience did I raise my voice or be rude to the staff, as I witnessed other guests doing. It would be nice if the hotel staff would reward well behaved and polite guests rather than treat them like crap. By rewarding the screamers you are teaching them that bad behavior is a good way to get results. You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing your industry or the world a favor.

So when I go on vacation and stay at a property where I'm not known by the hotel management or sales staff, it can sometimes be a let down. I have stayed at at least a dozen resorts on the Hawaiian Islands, including several of the top properties in the state. Having said that, I worried that the Royal Lahaina would not live up to my standards. I'm pleased to report that I was thrilled by the value and comfort of this property. I booked an excellent package through Costco Travel and would recommend it to anyone. No, the property is not the Four Seasons, but it is well maintained, the Tower rooms very clean and comfortable, and convenient. The beds were comfortable, the flat screen TV large, and the \"partial ocean view\" was terrific. The bathroom was roomy with a large walk-in shower. There was a small refrigerator and a decent sized safe (with no extra charge to use the safe). The hotel staff was friendly and kind. Our primary housekeeper, I believe her name was Ann, was sweet and friendly. When we would see her, she would ask how our day was, if we needed anything and when we asked for additional towels, was quick to offer more than we needed. (We actually missed her on her days off -- I've never missed a particular housekeeper before!). On our first full day there, I bought some sandwiches and chips at the ice cream/coffee shop for our lunch by the pool. Both times when we returned later in the week, the friendly young lady who worked there remembered me by name! I was impressed. The hotel valets were quick and efficient. I've seen many people complain about paying for parking here, but that is common at most hotels on the islands and in any big city. $10 a day is cheap and it is only $15 a day for the valet (our package came with valet parking). Reading the reviews on this site, I knew that self-parking was difficult, so $5 more per day is worth it for the valet. The main restaurant served a very respectable breakfast buffet (again, included in our package). It had a decent variety of items, but does not include an omlette or waffle station, or carvery, like many buffets. But even when there were lines to get in, the staff moved people in quickly and efficiently. I don't think we ever waited more than 5-10 minutes, even when there were dozens of parties in front of us. The restaurant could use a wider variety on its lunch/dinner menu (only one menu for both). But the portions were big and the food pretty good. The lounge chairs near both pools should be updated, as they were a little uncomfortable and look rather dated. My main suggestion to the hotel is to have servers to bring food and drink to those sitting at the pools. I'm sure they could make a lot of money by doing so. Even without, it is quick and easy to go to one of the bars to get served. Another great thing about the Royal Lahaina -- no resort fee. So many resorts try to charge you an extra $25-35 per day on top of your rate as a resort fee. They use lame excuses to justify it to cover the costs of things that should be included in your rate: room safes, local calls, towel service at the pool, lounge chairs, etc... You have to pay it even if you don't use those items. So no resort fee is a huge plus. All in all, it depends upon your expectations.

At booking, a staff member confirmed that I'd \"definitely, 100%\" be in the tower room. When I called back later to request email confirmation, they went back on their word and said that they didn't guarantee tower rooms at my rate. However, three different people, including the Director of Reservations and the Front Desk Manager, said that getting a tower room would not be an issue, and it all looked good to go. But upon arrival, I was told by a snappy, unfriendly front desk staff that I had to pay $75 to upgrade into the tower. Like previous reviews have stated, the Garden Cottage was dumpy, equatable to a '60s/'70s motel room. There were NO windows, just open holes with bug screens and wooden window blinds. Given this, everything was insanely damp, and the small window AC was entirely inefficient at cooling the room and keeping it dry. The maintenance/cleaning staff also evidently pays zero attention to detail: missing light bulbs, very obviously broken hair dryer, and the shower drain did not work properly. When we asked the front desk staff to send maintenance, the employee there actually gave us a hard time for requesting maintenance twice (\"I already had sent someone for your light bulb and now you're telling me you need a hair dryer?\") and had to be called three times before someone came. The staff proved themselves unhelpful and unknowledgeable: they couldn't tell us where to snorkel and gave laughably bad advice about when to set out for the Road to Hana (\"any time is fine, even 2 or 3PM\"). They also provided us with a broken Road to Hana audio CD, which made us lose two hours of our day because we thought our CD player was broken and tried to swap out our rental car only to realize that it was just the un-useable disk that the Royal Lahaina gave us. The ONLY thing going for this hotel is their location on the beautiful Kaanapali Beach. The staff knows it, so there's no incentive to provide better (or any) service. Even if we had gotten a tower room, the staff's unapologetic and ungracious behavior about everything would still have resulted in a bad review.

It was very nice, but the bathroom had old faucets that you practically needed a wrench to turn on and off. The room had a window air conditioner that didn't really make the room cool and drowned out the sound of the ocean. The only thing this resort going for it was the beach.

This is our sixth vacation in Maui, but the first time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve felt an obligation to write a formal review. The tone of our stay was set from the outset when the gentleman at the entrance gate stepped out not to check the purpose of our visit, but to greet us with a warm and sincere \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome Home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We had stayed at the Royal Lahaina before and we were delighted to find the downstairs facilities and ambiance unchanged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c true examples of the Aloha Spirit. Warm woods and island d\u00c3\u00a9cor with a most competent staff dedicated to making your stay memorable. We knew the Tower had undergone a major renovation and were most impressed with the new rooms. Much larger, the bath facilities well separated from the sleeping area, granite countertops and dark woods, an extremely comfortable bed, native art, and a balcony ocean view that was spectacular. As impressive as the new accommodations are, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the people that make the Royal Lahaina experience so enjoyable. Ford Ushijima, the food and beverage manager, has assembled a top notch staff to make sure each guest receives the ultimate in service and attention. From Ernie in the dining room who always brought a smile along with our morning coffee, to Eric and Raffi at the bar who helped us enjoy our afternoons and evenings, Ford has made sure each of his staff brings the same joy and enthusiasm to the workplace that he brings himself. Although there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153formal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dining in the evening, food is served until 9 p.m. and the selection is excellent and unique. If you want a great burger, they have it, but my advice is to mix and match. One evening we ordered one of the flat bread pizzas, a bowl of the roasted pepper soup, and a bowl of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bust da mouth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lobster macaroni and cheese \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than enough for two people andeasily the most enjoyable meal we had on our trip. There is entertainment poolside each evening, singer/guitarists George and Josh take turns at the mike on alternate evenings and are accompanied by the most lovely and talented hula dancers you likely to see anywhere on the island. The entertainment ends around 9 p.m and the bar closes at 10. While we were there they had a great special going on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Monday, Wednesday, and Friday wines and champagne were 50% off, so if the bar happened to close before you surrendered the evening, you could pick a nice bottle from their excellent wine list to take to your room and enjoy on your balcony. Any honest review has to include at least one con, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mine. On our previous visit the breakfast buffet included made to order omelets and they were outstanding. The buffet is still good, especially if included in your package, but the omelet chef is definitely missed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, complaint department closed. So there you have it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one glowing, unqualified, double thumbs up review.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom ocean-front cottage (2nd floor of the cottage buildings). It worked well for us as we had two teenage boys with us and there were folding doors between the rooms so we could have privacy. It's a spacious suite that needs some TLC. Our bed was super comfortable, but on the boys side, the pull-out sofa-bed was in such bad shape it couldn't be slept on, so the boys shared the day bed which they said was okay. Our suite had a kitchenette so we went to Safeway in Lahaina and stocked up on essentials (water, and beer and wine of course!) and breakfast items. The best part of our suite was the location. On arrival, I was a bit disappointed that our two lanais faced the garden area and not the ocean, but it was fine. Many nights we ended up making the very short walk to the beach, to sit on the sand and listen to the waves and look up at the stars. I'm very surprised more people didn't do this as the resort (even the tower) is so close to the beach. It was one of the highlights of the trip for me. We had two rainy days, so we spent part of the afternoon sitting on our covered lanai, reading and drinking wine. Heaven! We deliberately chose not to stay in the tower even though the rooms there have been renovated because we wanted the ability to walk outside or door and just be outside. It was perfect. They aren't fancy accommodations, but they are spacious and the location couldn't be better. Many mornings we saw whales from the beach (I loved Kaanapali Beach, it was never crowded, and just felt relaxed and you could spread out as much as you needed to.) The restaurant is good, service is generally slow, and it seemed like there was quality entertainment most nights (the entertainers we saw were very good). We didn't enjoy the coffee in our suite, so went to the Royal Scoop (on site) for Americano's which were very good (and had excellent sandwiches to take along on road trips around the island). We had two excellent meals at Basil Tomato's. Whaler's Village (excellent shops and restaurants) is a short walk away, and Lahaina is a very short drive away. I wouldn't recommend the luau. The one in Lahaina is apparently better. If you are traveling with teenagers be aware that there likely won't be many other teenagers there. At the time we were there, our two boys were the only teenagers we saw. They said they had a good time (I mean, sun and surf, as opposed to snow and cold where we're from!), but they would've enjoyed meeting other kids their age.

The room was so clean, the stuffs was so friendly, the atmosphere was relaxing, the view was fantastic, everything was just perfect. The food was amazing, the dinner with self-seating was so convenient.The guy who played guitar with the lady who danced just another additional for another romantic night. One thing though, the breakfast serve at 7-11 a.m.---if you're late, they will be a big line. So, try to be there around 7 or 8 a.m. You can charge everything to your room, and pay when you check out. The breakfast buffet is the best price at $19.50/person. We recommended trying Papaya, it was so juicy. We're also recommended trying to see the Expedia Local Expert, which located just right outside the door. They'll be able to give you some coupon which you'll be able to use it at the hotel & somewhere else. The Expedia Local Expert Concierge was fantastic, especially Derrick. The ice-cream was rejuvenating. The beach was so close enough to just be able to pop-in & pop-out. With two swimming pools & a lot of seating giving us a lot of choices. We've a blast on this trip. Like we all know \"Non of Hawaii trip is cheap\", but we believe Royal Lahaina Resort was well worth it.

We've been to Maui before and stayed at The Hyatt at our last visit, this time around we didn't want to spend a lot of money on the hotel as we don't spend all that much time at the hotel itself. So, we booked the Royal Experience package on Hawaiian Airlines which included an Ocean View room for 5 nights, a welcome bottle of champagne, a sunset dinner cruise, a luau, and free breakfast buffet each morning. Prior to booking the hotel, I did a lot of research online and read the reviews regarding the Royal Lahaina and their rooms and cottages. I knew that we definitely wanted to be in the remodeled tower and not the cottage. I also read a lot about people who showed up and their rooms were not available and so they were offered alternatives for their first night. During our check in, we were advised that our Ocean View room was not available, they were overbooked. The hotel clerk offered to put us in the Kaanapali Inn for the first night and upgrade us to the Deluxe Ocean View for the remaining four nights. So, we would be downgraded the first night and then upgraded the remaining four nights. He also threw in free self-parking for the trip, a $50 value. I didn't put up a fight as I don't think it's the clerks fault for overbooking. So, I was prepared for the downgraded room...this room was VERY much in need of remodeling. The room smelt of mildew and the room was very dingy, luckily it was only for a night. We ran into another couple who checked in earlier that day and recieved the same sad news, they were overbooked and their Ocean View room was not available and they were offered the downgraded room as well. However, they refused and asked that the hotel figure it out. They ended up getting placed in the Deluxe Oceavn View room on their first night and were allowed to stay in the room throughout their entire stay. A part of me wishes I would have put up a fight to get the same deal. But it was vacation and I wasn't in the mood to argue. They made the move easy, we just packed our things and they moved our belongings the next morning by 11 AM. We were already out and about on the town. The new room was fabulous, we were placed on the 11th of 12 floors and the Deluxe Ocean View was very much like an Ocean Front view. The difference between Deleuxe Ocean and Ocean View is that the Deluxe Ocean views are the rooms closer to the ocean, whereas the Ocean View rooms are towards the back of the building. The room itself was very clean, modern, and fresh. When we stayed at The Hyatt in the past, the room was very dated and somewhat dark. These rooms were bright and open. The buffet breakfast was good. I love papaya and had that just about every morning. The selection was quite large. You could pick from fresh fruits, pastries, breads, bagels, granola, cereals, oatmeals, pancakes, waffles, french toast, eggs, sausage, potatoes, etc. I think this was a great value as everyone who's been to Hawaii knows...food is expensive here! The luau was not bad. I read all these horrific reviews and was prepared for the worst, It wasn't bad. We went to the Old Lahaina Luau at our last visit and had low expectations for this luau. In fact, the experience was good and the food was as good as any luau buffet food...decent. The pools at the hotel were basic and small. The pool at The Hyatt was a lot nicer. You're not going to want to hang out at the pool at this hotel, there just aren't any amenitites (swim up bar, water slides, ambiance, etc.). This hotel doesn't have a spa or a fitness facility either. However, for a great room in a good location, I would recommend this hotel hands down.

First, there are the \"TOWER rooms.\" They are the ones you will see in all their advertising on various websites: they are very nice, modern, clean etc- NO QUESTION a 4 star category (somewhat made me think of a Crowne Plaza with a nice Hawaiian touch). THEN, there are also the so-called COTTAGES. Here is my most honest assessment of the Royal Lahaina Cottages: If you have ever taken a long road trip and got to the point where you were so tired that ANY hotel/motel will do, because it is better than falling asleep at the wheel and causing injuries/death to yourself and others, and you see a \"Bates Motel: rooms rented by the hour\" and you think, \"what the heck- it's only for a night... BELIEVE ME, ANY SHADY HOTEL OFF AN AMERICAN INTERSTATE IS N-I-C-E-R THAN THE ROYAL LAHAINA COTTAGES!!! They are old, foul-smelling and downright disgusting!!!!!!!!! Of course their only availability for OUR stay was a cottage room. After I basically told the reception guy that I'd rather get a rectal exam from an unskilled West Texan oil rig worker than stay 7 nights at the cottages, he offered me an \"upgrade\" to a Tower room for about $280 for the 7 nights (there was a fee because we had booked a \"garden view room which, according to them, could be either a Tower room OR a cottage room. The 'upgraded\" room would be a partial ocean view...). Well, I was left with no choice than paying an unplanned $280 which made me less-than-happy. The reason we initially booked the Royal Lahaina was because it seemed like a better value than its neighboring properties (Sheraton, Westin, Marriott, Hyatt etc). Now, with the \"upgrade costs we could have stayed at one of the other properties for more-or-less the same price... The reason why I am upset (even though ultimately the Tower Room was \"great\") is because of the hotel's dishonesty. YOU CANNOT ADVERTISE YOURSELF AS A 4 STAR PROPERTY WHEN A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ROOMS ARE ABOUT 1/2 STAR QUALITY!!! If I go to a Mercedes dealership and order a luxury sedan, no sane car dealer would expect me to accept a small economy car for the same price and then expect me to pay an \"upgrade charge\" to get the luxury model I was under the impression of getting in the first place!!!

Royal Lahaina is a reasonably priced option on North Kaanapali beach. Because we decided pretty late in the game to go to Maui for Christmas, all of the other hotels were in the high-season-extortion mode. Normally, we like to stay at the Sheraton for its great beach and convenient location, but we just planned too late to get a decent rate there. Royal Lahaina was by far the most reasonably priced hotel on Kaanapali for this trip, although it is north of black rock and just slightly off the beaten track. We had 3 rooms in the tower, and all had a nice modern yet Hawaiian decor. I think another review mentioned this, but one thing odd was that in the ocean front rooms, the vanity area is open and looks like it should be a wet bar. I think it was left open so that you can see the view from that part of the room, but it's a little strange. My relatives were in partial ocean view rooms, and the vanities in their rooms were enclosed, which seemed a little more normal. One other oddity is the mini-fridge. We were informed that it is actually a \"chiller\" not a fridge. The difference is that it does not get very cold. Not a big deal, but don't try to keep perishables in the chiller. After reading all of the TA reviews, I still wasn't sure what to expect. The tower rooms have been renovated, but I'd guess that the rest of the hotel has not been. It is a bit funky, in a retro kind of way. The hotel does grow on you. On advice of the TA reviews, we got the \"value package\" that included 2 mai tais per day, valet parking, and the newspaper. After being w/family every day, the mai tais, were great. There is a nice casual bar area near the pool where there are Hawaiian singers in the evening. (As a side note, the lower floor ocean front rooms can be a little loud during the entertainment b/c they are directly above the restaurant/bar area.) The pool was better than expected, but it is not on the scale of a mega-resort. It is a good size, and pretty relaxing. The lounge chairs were comfy, although they could use more of them. The room service menu was extremely limited, so we did not try it. We had high hopes for the Don the Beachcomer bar, as it looked kitchy and retro from the outside. But, it seemed more like a holding pen for the luau crowd, so we bailed. It could have just been bad timing on our part. The little store on property is convenient and well-stocked. We also found a good little breakfast spot called the Castaway Cafe, which is located on the property just north of Royal Lahaina (I think it's condos).

The rooms in the tower are nice, very comfortable and clean, the view was ok too considering it was only supposed to be partial ocean, we enjoyed it. The part that was absolutely ridiculous though was upon check out, we reviewed the bill and they had charged us the full rate for the room the 1st night in the crappy motel next door, when we complained they said they had given us 1 free breakfast (a whopping $20 value). When we complained further they said that we had \"chosen\" to stay there instead of staying at the royal lahaina in exchange for free breakfast. Now they were just lying! Why on earth would we have chosen to stay at a crappy hotel in exchange for a free breakfast. After finally talking to management they gave us free parking which amounted to around $50. Still I beleive we should not have payed for the first night since it was not what we booked and obviously the hotels fault for overbooking. I heard from other guests that the same thing had been done to them. This is obviously a very hotel poor policy and terrible customer service.

The hotel is located on the north Kaanapali beach, about 15 minute walk from the main resort area. There is a trail along the beach, although it was not well illuminated at night and sometimes goes through the parking lots at the back of the hotels. The beach next to the hotel was very nice, with only a few people; the water was very calm and clear. The ocean floor was sandy - to snorkle you would need to walk a little to the north or to the south. Food options on Kaanapali were a bit limited and expensive. Few resturants and bars are open after 9PM. To have a real choice you should drive to Lahaina (5-10 min), but that means having a designated driver for the drive back. Parking was additional $10/day. When checking in, I asked for a room with internet access (another $10/day). Initially I was given a room in one of the cottages, but the WiFi signal did not reach there. After I complained (nicely), I was upgraded into a tower room for the same rate. From what I saw, the cottages were quite nice, compared to what I read in the reviews. The tower rooms, however, were much more stylish. They had mini-refridgerator, coffee maker, safe, flat-screen tv, clock radio with iPod dock and you could see the ocean from the balcony of almost every room. That said, I think the main hotel and the cottages should be marketed separately, since the customers may expect the rooms shown on the website, but get a bit more basic accomodations. The lobby of the hotel was very lively, with vendors selling souvenirs and consierge helping book activities (I cannot comment on the prices, since I did not buy anything). The restaurant had a nice open-air terrace. I've only been there for breakfast and it was very good. Just be sure not to miss the breakfast special of eggs, bacon/sausage and potatoes/rice for $7 istead of the $20 breakfast buffet. $3 for a cup of tea, though, felt like a rip-off. The swimming pools were kind of pointless, since there was the ocean a few steps away - I only seen people in them a couple of times. There was a booth renting snorkles, fins, etc. and lending beach towels for free. In summary, I really enjoyed stying there, although if I were to go again, I would probably stay in Lahaina, exchanging the gorgeous beach for being closer to civilization.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glendora, California", "Title": "\u201cUNBELIABLE!\u201d", "Author": "glendoraflorist", "ReviewID": "UR89519649", "Content": "We were there celebrating our anniversary, which we will never forget.

The AC is a wall unit that's crudely cut out with boards holding it up.

All that goes away when you realize you are at the ground floor of a resort in Maui. Open the back door and the garden is your back yard. There are no elevators to wait for, nor people asking your for anything. Wake up, open the doors, and take a minute walk to the beach.

Although on other days we noticed people getting the full treatment (flower, warm cloths, water ect). The staff at the front desk offers no information about the resort or its facilities and when we inquired, they were less than forthcoming.

The room itself is beautiful! Very clean, nice understated island decor. Gorgeous view of the ocean and the islands in the distance. The location is fabulous. The beach is perfect with calm water, perfect for swimming. It was never too crowded, lots of space. Several people snorkeled right off the beach. The two pools are just average. The chairs are good, although there's no good view of the ocean from the pool area. We didn't mind though since we spent our time on the beach. Snorkel gear, body boards, beach chairs and umbrellas are available to rent but very expensive. You're much better off renting from Snorkel Bob's for a fraction of the price (which we did). Beware that parking is very limited and you'll pay $10/day. We didn't realize this until we checked in. There's a luau at the nearby hotel every night, so parking in the evening if you return from dinner is very annoying. The luau guests never seem to park in their section of the lot, so it can be a hike back to your room. The spots are also VERY SMALL, like smartcar small. So take heed if you're driving something bigger than a compact. Overall, the best part of the resort is the beach/location, and the cleanliness of the room.

It all depends on the timing and person at the front desk. We were given a north facing balcony, partial ocean view room with a king bed that was spacious and clean. The view from the room was magnificent but if you are on a lower floor, your view will be blocked by the group of buildings that house the luau and other hotel facilities, something to keep in mind when booking the location of your room. Throughout our stay, the cleaning staff was very diligent in refilling toiletries, restocking towels, and arranging the room in a neat manner. They do clean during the mornings but I only had to tell them to come back again once during the week around 8AM. The location of the hotel is very close to downtown Lahaina so nighttime activites can be filled with trips to downtown for dining/shopping/ or a leisurely stroll. Coming from New York, the distances to various towns in Maui seemed to be a little farther than what I would have preferred.

The breakfast buffet is average, nothing to definitely experience. The beach is steps away from the hotel and stretches north. Snorkeling was very good at the Blackrock, saw multiple turtles up close. Whalers Village is next door with a shuttle bus from the resort providing some variety from the limited selection of shops and restaurants at the hotel. The worst aspect of the hotel was the parking. They charge you $10 a day and the spots are legitimately small.

(Depending on the time you go you may need to book a table at these though) The main bar seems to shut at 10pm and Don The Beachcomber bar hardly ever seemed to open at all except when there was a Luai on. The advertised fitness centre is not on site but at the local Fairway shops on the golf course. Onto the plus points, all the bar staff were very friendly especially Bill in the Tiki Bar. We especially enjoyed the 2pm to 6pm Happy Hour. Our room was kept clean by a couple of (We think) Phillipino ladies who we had a good laugh with every morning, not sure if they really understood us or not but a good game! The free internet in the Guest Relations office was a nice touch (You get great complimentary cookies in there as well) but only had 1 station so you invariably have to wait. A trip into Lahaina town is a must. It's like it's been stuck in a time warp or something. A $1 bus ride from Whalers Village into Lahaina is money well spent. I would recommend this hotel as there are good points and there are a lot of activities you can indulge in if you desire or you can just chill out around the pool but a course in customer relations for the check in staff would be a great idea.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation - perfect beach location\u201d", "Author": "JHS19", "ReviewID": "UR84947973", "Content": "Pefect beach location, gardens with pool ideal for families, we loved every minute of it not stuffy very easy going, Royal Scoop great for snacks staff accomodating", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anderson, IN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Beautiful Sunsets\u201d", "Author": "Travelguru24", "ReviewID": "UR84817940", "Content": "The Renevated part of hotel was Very nice.

We booked garden view cottage and were told that we would receive complimentary room upgrade based upon availability and complimentary bottle of champagne because we were on our honeymoon. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a rude staff and told that we rooms are not available for upgrade but for $35/night rooms are available for an upgrade. We weren't expecting an upgrade until we were told that we will be getting upgrade based on availability. So why is it that the rooms are not available for complimentary upgrade that they told we would get but is available when you pay $35/night? We kept on telling them that we were told that we will offered upgrade and they kept on telling us rudely that rooms are not available for upgrade and they are fully booked but we can get upgrade for $35 by one staff and when we talked to another, it was $50 by another rude staff. We didn't want to ruin our honeymoon by arguing with the staff so we decided to check out the cottage room. When the the staff opened the door to our cottage room, the room smelled really bad.... I agree with a previous review using sewer to describe the smell. smelled really bad. Room was dirty, old, falling apart, dingy.... just disgusting. Insects crawling around. I couldn't bare the smell for 1 minute never mind the whole vacation. We decided to pay for an upgrade for $35 a night. We feel cheated as we were told that we would get an upgrade based on availability but they keep on telling us the rooms are not available for upgrade but for $35 they were plenty of rooms available for upgrade. We mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to marriott in oahu just a week before heading to maui and they gave us complimentary upgrade without asking and we were really happy because we weren't expecting one because they never told us that they would give us one but with Royal Lahaina, they told us we would get complimentary upgrade so that is why we expected one. However, they did honor the complimentary bottle of champagne. The room they gave us in the tower had a big black stain on the bed so we called front desk and they told us to call housekeeping. We tried calling housekeeping for a long time but there was no reply. We finally gave up because we were really tired and had to sleep on a dirty bed that night. Didn't want to deal with the rude people at front desk anymore so we just went to bed on a dirty bed that night. The next morning, we got up early and decided try the breakfast at the hotel. We were greeted by another rude staff. she took us to a table, my husband and I spotted a big, bright pink lipstick stain on the coffee mug where she seated us. I don't know how anyone could have missed that lipstick stain. we saw from a far distance and we told her there was a stain on the mug and she rolled her eyes and made a sound and walked off with the mug and returned with another mug which she threw on the table and walked off. We were very unhappy with this kind of attitude and decided not to eat there anymore. So from day 2, we had to drive out every morning for breakfast and did not eat at the restaurant so can't comment on the food. After a long day out on day 2, we noticed there wasn't any kleenex and they didn't refill our shampoo and shower gel so we had to call housekeeping to get them but we kept calling for over 15 minutes and no one replied. An answering machine went on and we left a message but a long time no one brought the items. we tried callling again and still no reply. So we used the almost empty bottles of shampoo and shower gel from the previous day and we didn't have enough shampoo and shower gel for our showers. After a long day 3, we noticed they forgot to give us bath towels so we had to order them and same thing happened... no reply and we left a messages and still no one replied and no one brought towels so we both had to use a small towel as a bath towel. The next morning we tried calling for a towel and miraculously, someone answered the phone so we asked for 2 towels but we waited for a long time and no one brought towels so we tried calling again and no one answers again and when we left about 1 and half hour after calling and still no one brought the towel yet. my husband had to shower in the morning with the small towels again. but when we came back in the evening, there were 2 extra towels on the bed. I don't know when they brought up the towels but it must have been after the maid service since the towels were on top of already made bed. so that day we had 4 towels. After 3 days bad experience with this hotel and housekeeping, we gave up calling housekeeping and decided that we would wait around in the morning to see if we could find any cleaning lady and ask for anything we needed or anything they forget to give us. What a waste of time for us. Day 4, we wanted to go to the beach so my husband goes down to get some beach towels early in the morning. Guess what, the staff tells my husband they ran out and towels will be there in 5 minutes. My husband comes up to get me and we go down together. It must be at least 15 minutes after he initially asked for towels and we go together. There were still no beach towels yet. the staff tells us to come back in 10 minutes so we decide to grab breakfast at the hotel. We went to the store across the street and couldn't find anything so we bought a pastry and fruit salad at the ice cream place. Worst pastry I ever had and not freshly baked. Fruist salad wasn't fresh neither. we took a bite and couldn't eat it anymore and had to throw it out. We walk around a bit looking for something to eat but couldn't find anything at the resort so we went back to get beach towels and it was at least 1 hour after we initally went and still no beach towel. There was a group of people standing near the pool waiting for towels. They told us to come back in 10 minutes again. We didn't know how long it was going to take and decided not to swim at the beach anymore and had to think of something else to do. There beach towels when we came back in the afternoon so we grabbed 4 just in case they run out again and we went swimming next day. Oh and the activities lady was rude and unhelpful too. Just one bad experience after another at this hotel. But near the end of this trip. We went to guest services to ask them for recommendations for a special occasion dinner and we met a very helpful and kind staff by the name of Gilbert who helped us call restaurants and he also helped us make a reservation. We also met a very nice lady at guest services by the name of Chiba who also gave us directions and recommended a few restaurants to us. Overall experience was very bad besides the 2 very kind people we met at guest services. Room at the cottage was disgusting but room in the tower looked ok but were not very clean. dust everywhere and stain on bed the first day. never been to a hotel where housekeeping doesn't answer calls. items are always there within 15 minutes to 30 minutes after requesting them. also forgot to mention that it was noisy also. WOuld never return to Royal Lahaina resort. I would have went to Sheraton instead if I known I would have to pay $35 more a night for half decent room. The pools and facilities are much nicer at the Sheraton. Didn't know that cottage would be that bad and feel cheated that they wouldn't give us upgrade when they told us we would get one. Didn't make our honeymoon special at all. Regret booking this hotel and would never come back.

Our family visited Maui recently and chose to stay at the Royal Lahaina Resort after sorting over several places with our travel agent. We were extremely pleased with every aspect of the resort. I have to say that this place is top notch. I have no complaints and I can't even find a tiny reason to rate it less than excellent. The staff at the resort was extremely friendly and always met us with a smile and an Aloha. We became fast friends with several employees there and even the shop oweners at the resort became like family, speaking as we walked past daily. The maids, when they would hear us walk past a room they were cleaning, would shout \"Aloha\", even if they couldn't see us. I have never experienced a place like this. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we had the most memorable vacation possible. One evening I had walked down to take some sunset photos and as I walked back up the steps into the resort a fire dancer and a friend of his commented on my camera. After learning I was passionate about photography, he pointed to a spot and said, \"If you go stand over there, we are about to do our torch lighting ceremony and you'll be able to get some really great pictures\". It was that way with everyone at Royal Lahaina. The resort was immaculate. We stayed in the tower and the rooms were awesome. Their grounds were perfectly pedicured and the cleanest I have ever seen. I have to say, don't change a thing, you are the best!! Our week went by too fast but I am so happy to say that we will be returning to Maui in February 2011 to see the whales and we will be staying at the Royal Lahiana again.

We initially booked a Terrace View room and at check-in upgraded for a few extra bucks to an OCEANVIEW room and it was soooo worth it! READ ALL MY EXTRA TIPS BELOW: 1) Go purchase the book MAUI REVEALED by Andrew Doughty. If you get nothing else from this review take this piece of advice. Write it down now and go purchase it ASAP! You'll thank me later....it will be your bible while on vacation and you will be soooo happy you have it. 2) There are a lot of amenities on the resort however, you HAVE TO HAVE A CAR to go and do anything - public transportation on Maui is bad and slow and expensive. We found the restaurants on the resort to be ok and way overpriced (as well as the shops). So jump in the car and drive to LULU's each morning for breakfast...FANTASTIC and CHEAP for Maui (it's right by the Safeway at the Cannery Mall on Highway 30 - less than a 10 minute drive from the resort. You can find great shopping all over the island (WAL-Mart on Dairy Road by far has the cheapest prices for great souvenirs). 3) The Whaler's Village is within walking distance however, it's better to drive so you don't have to carry all your purchases back to you room. Also, the parking is $5 at the W.V. however, if you spend over $20 at any place (including the restaurants) they will validate your parking (remember to take your ticket with you...don't leave it in the car). Every restaurant there is awesome but pricey. Again, LuLu's has fantastic dishes for each meal and big portions - consider splitting meals and you can be eating for under $20 a meal (for two). 4) The snorkeling is amazing! We rented snorkeling equipment from the activities desk at the pool for $30 each for the entire week (you can rent it by the day too). We went to about 12 locations to snorkel and the 2 best beaches we found are right by the resort - on the Sheraton side of Black Rock (10 minute walk south of the resort) and a 5 minute walk north is Kahekili Beach was hands down THE BEST SNORKELING we did the entire trip. So many kinds of fish, stingrays, octopus and sea turtles galore! We paid a couple hundred dollars and did a boat trip through TRILOGY and didn't see near the kinds of fish we did right there at the beach. TRILOGY was fun and great in a lot of ways but I wouldn't do it again. 5) The Luau - so not worth it. We did the Feast at LeLe which on all the internet searches said it was the \"best\". Setting got an A+, first impressions got an A+, first Mai Tai got an A+, first round of food got a B+, all drinks after that got a C, all the food following that got a D+, the entertainment....C at best. The highlight was the fire guy at the end and his 3 minute show. It cost us $250 and 12 cocktails later we walked out SOBER! The first Mai Tai's were strong but all other drinks after that we not strong at all, maybe they forgot the alcohol. I'll never do a Luau again. I would have rather spent that $$ on a helicopter ride. 6) The Road to Hana - definitely put it on your agenda but keep in mind you need to leave the hotel by 5:30 a.m. because this is an ALL DAY event. By the time you get to the 7 Sacred Pools you'll be tired and cranky and hopefully you took some motion sickness medication as soon as you left the hotel. There is a ton to see and a lot of twists and turns on that road but it is GORGEOUS! A must do! We did take the Kaupo Trail around the rest of the island but I don't recommend this way for the faint of heart. It's really bad for about 10 miles and not near as pretty. On the way to Hana, there are plenty of little food stands all along the way that we didn't pack any food. Stopping at these little stands was half the fun. We had fresh coconut, banana bread, ice cream (awesome) and BBQ at all different stands. It was ALL GOOD but these places only take cash. 7) Do you like art? You'll LOVE Front Street in Lahaina! 8) Do you like Sushi? My recommendations are Sansei (in Kapalua 15-20 minutes from the resort) and Kobe (right off front street). 9) If you have time and want one high end meal definitely make MaMa's Fish House a must stop. About 10 miles from the airport and the setting can't be beat! We did a cocktail each, split the Mama's House Special, coffee and dessert and our bill was $130...and worth every penny! 10) FREE INTERNET ACCESS - if you go to LuLu's they are right next to StarBucks and you can pick up their free WiFi signal. I had to check-in with work each morning so I took my lap top to breakfast. So I never logged onto the resort WiFi, saving there $10/day fee. The Safeway grocery store is right there as well if you want to get water and alcohol. We saved a lot by mixing cocktails in our room before heading to the pool.

Unfortunately we were served by a particular female staffer at the front desk who received us with indifference and then annoyance after we made our request. Following 10 or more minutes of fiddling on the computer without either acknowledging or explaining what she was doing and talking in undertones with her colleague in another language, she advised us she would organise for our room to be readied as early as possible and told us to check in with her a bit later (hello, where's the service?). We did, about 45mins later, and were told to wait. So we waited, and waited, and at 3pm- official check in time- again went up to the front desk. The room wasnt ready. Another 15mins passed with this staffer again ignoring me, consulting and giggling with hotel colleagues, presumably in filipino, and talking on the phone without a word of explanation. Then I was asked to step aside while someone arranged a key. This took more than 5mins and was expedited by another staffer. My experiences of customer service in Hawaii up to that point had been positive and this encounter tarnished my view of the hotel and my willingness to spend any more hours there than were utterly necessary. Such were my feelings about the rudeness of the staffer that the problem of a blocked shower drain in an old and unscrubbed bathtub- the shower I had looked forward to after a pretty long stressful day ended with my wallowing in ankle deep filthy water- was secondary. Our 'garden view' room located in the furthest corner of the resort, reeked of a badly maintained public restroom- 'smelled musty' is a polite description. There was no hotel service directory- how is one to navigate oneself?- and I only found out by observing other patrons that a map of the grounds was available- another oversight of the front desk. Had our experience of the hotel been better I might forgive it its poor location- on a beachfront, yes, but for those without a car, this equates to 1 bus and 1 trolley trip to/from Lahaina, plus a further 2 bus trips if travelling to the airport or approx $60 one way cab fare, which is more than we were charged in New York.

My husband had called from our layover in CA, and we were told that we had been booked in a cottage and no tower garden rooms were available, but for $40 more a night we could upgrade to an ocean view tower room. When we got to the hotel, we were told the same thing about the upgrade. We had booked on Priceline ($100/night), so I expected they would put us in the cottages. My husband asked if we could see the cottage and then decide what we wanted to do. Then the front desk girl told us, that well, we could see the cottage they would put us in the 1st night, which was a suite, b/c all garden cottages were booked and we'd have to move the next day to a garden view cottage (she said the rooms were all practically the same though). My husband then asked about the upgrade, and we were told that well (oops), that wouldn't be available until the next night, so we had to stay in the cottage suite that 1st night. My husband was being very nice and patient, as was the front desk girl. He told her, he hated to move around, so then she said - how about we stay in the cottage suite night 1 and then the next day, we'd be moved to a tower ocean view room, no extra charge! I was thrilled with the ocean view tower room, and my husband was thrilled with the $40 savings per night! The cottage was not as bad as I expected. It was clean and updated in the bedroom and living areas - the suite had a sitting area with a TV, a kitchen area, and a 2nd bed, and then another area with a king bed and TV - it also had 2 bathrooms (I'm pretty sure it was 2 rooms they tore down 1/2 wall and made into a suite). The bathrooms in the cottages are not updated, but they are still clean. It is most noticeable in the shower/tub because the tile shows it's age. It was a bit musty at first, but my husband cranked the a/c and turned on the ceiling fan and the smell went away. They have several cottages right on the lawn - ocean front - steps to the ocean, that I would have stayed in for the whole time (if it was 1st floor). Strange, but only the 1st floor of the cottages seem to have lanais with chairs and a table. The next morning we were upgraded to our ocean view - and what a view! It was about 75-80% ocean view, then trees and gardens and a roof from another RL building (floor 5 for us - there are 12 floors) - so beautiful to look out each morning and see the ocean and palm trees and boats already out. The room was updated and very clean and nice. They even had a flat screen HD TV. The room was a little small, but we were mostly out and about, so it was fine for showering and sleeping (nice comfy bed!). You do get a mini-fridge, nice for soda and water. Everything they say about the parking spots being small is so true!! But, after a day, my husband became quite adept at pulling into small spots. The small spots are all over Maui - not just at the RL. The pools are not spectacular, but are clean. They even come around with fruit on a stick -- we hit that a couple of days before lunch time. They have a huge bin of towels, so you can take as many as you want - which was very nice. The beach is beautiful and very uncrowded. Even on the day we hit it \"crowded\" it wasn't really crowded. There is some awesome snorkeling around Black Rock - we walked down a bit from the hotel, and jumped in at the far end of the RL beach and went around Black Rock to the Sheraton side (saw 2 turtles and a manta ray! and TONS of fish). Whaler's Village is a short walk away (or you can take the free trolley) - they have shops and restaurants, lots of high end places. The pizza place (food court) was very qood, and we loved YogurtLand! Lahaina is about 10 minutes away, and we got lucky and found parking in the free lots every time (try Cool Cat Cafe - the hula chicken - hands down the BEST chicken ever!). Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was very nice. We had a few small requests (another suitcase stand, and extra towels) and each time, someone came up to our room very quickly. The housekeeping staff doesn't seem to always restock all the towels, or the shampoo/soap (they even have body wash!), so a few times we had to get extra supplies - there was always a cart on the floor, so it wasn't hard. All in all, this was a great deal for a hotel (the Sheraton and Hyatt I read were going for $175 on Priceline, vs $100 for the RL). We walked thru the Sheraton on the way to Whaler's Village, and it was HUGE. The pool looked really nice, it was huge and they seemed to have a lazy river (but it was dark, so I never saw if they had tubes to ride). The RL has a great, uncrowded beach and the 2 pools are clean, just small and regular (the most I ever saw in the pool at once were 3 people!). They have a nice grass area that you can move the lounge chairs to, and find some shade in the afternoon (while we always found chairs, there usually weren't more than a few unoccupied ones). There wasn't a lot of shade on the beach - a little from the trees in the morning, but none in the afternoon. The pool had a little shade in the morning, none by 11am or so. The lawn did offer some shade in the afternoon. All in all, this is a very nice hotel, and we didn't have to pinch pennies to stay here! Maui is beautiful, and the ocean is so perfectly clear it is amazing! We had a late 11pm flight out, so we asked about a late checkout and you can get a 1pm checkout no charge (normal checkout is 12pm) or you can pay $100 and get a checkout at 6:30pm. Also, you could checkout and sign up to use their hospitality suite. We opted to check out at 1pm and toured south Maui before heading to the airport. The hotel did seem pretty booked, probably because they are the most affordable hotel in the area. I think this hotel received 3 and 1/2 and not 4 stars because of the following - the cottages (they are 2.5 stars I would say), the pools (the other 4 star hotels show elaborate pools) and no fitness center on-site (there is a fitness center you can use within walking distance - for I think $10 a day). If you want to exercise, there are great sidewalks that wind around all the hotels, great for walking or jogging. Also, Maui has some good hiking trails.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Red Deer, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Maui\u201d", "Author": "JandN1234", "ReviewID": "UR81709765", "Content": "We split our vacation between Kihei and Lahaina - couldn't decide which one as first timers. They have different qualities as towns, and we enjoyed both for different reasons. Lahaina is much more touristy and busy - with Kihei being \"laid back\" - having a hippy vibe to its local restaurants and beaches. Royal Lahaina is not within walking distance to Lahaina, you should rent a car. Smaller the better - the parking lot stalls are extremely compact. You have to pay for parking, might as well get valet service. They market the hotel as a resort, but it's more of a hotel with a few resort qualities. When we arrived - we were told that they had overbooked the cottages and would receive an upgrade to one of the tower rooms. Fine with us - we had read the reviews about the cottages and were going to ask for an upgrade anyways. Our room was very clean, renovated, very comfy bed. Lanai overlooked the golf course. Pool was fine, nothing special. The hotel is on a nice swimming beach, fun snorkeling at the far end towards the Sheraton. If you put on your snorkel gear on the Royal Lahaina beach, hop in, you can snorkel all the way around Black Rock, the Sheraton is on the other side. Lots of fish , a few massive resident turtles and a few pieces of coral that are not dead. As soon as you get to the Sheraton side - you will appreciate Royal Lahaina more - it was very busy with all sorts of touristy types. You can either swim back, or take a quick walk through the Sheraton parking lot to hop back on the beach walk path to RL. The restaurant was okay - nothing special - happy hour is worth it. Whalers Village has a few restaurants that are within walking distance that are quite nice and decently priced. We would not recommend the luau at the hotel. Okay food, okay entertainment, drinks left us thirsty. MIght as well sit in the hotel restaurant/bar and watch the torch lighting at sunset for free with a nice fresh beer or glass of wine. Overall - great value when you are staying on the same stretch of gorgeous beach and amazing ocean as people paying ridiculous amounts of money on big name resorts. I would enjoy staying here again. I would not recommend for families - not enough for kids to do and the shore drops off pretty deep. You also have to rent a car to get the Maui experience, more great beaches further up the highway. We walked through some of the resorts on the beach walk - most looked great, fancy pools, lots of restaurants and bars - but for the price you pay - you have to decide what you are going to Maui for.

The views from the room, or from the balconies were like something out of a postcard. The sound of the waves on the beach were heavenly to fall asleep to, and surreal to wake up to. The resort has a small convenience store right on site that was perfect for any little purchases (including everything from ice cream to liquor). The staff was outstanding, with the exception of one bartender named Richard (but everyone has a bad day sometimes), and they even went way out of their way to accommodate us during an emergency trip to the hospital (completely unrelated to anything associated with the resort). The breakfast buffet offered plenty of variety...and while I wouldn't say it was the best food on the island it was still better than anything I could have whipped up myself. The hotel sits on what is arguably the nicest stretch of beach on the entire island, and while the pools can't compete with some of the bigger resorts for style...a couple of Mai Tai's at the Tiki Bar and you won't know the difference! The Royal Lahaina Luau was a pretty good show too, and it was the highlight of the entire trip for my wife. A couple of notes worth pointing out: 1) If you booked events/activities as part of a package with your stay make sure you make arrangements to take care of them as soon as possible. We didn't run in to any problems ourselves, but I know quite a few people simply couldn't fit in the Luau or Dinner Cruise on the days they wanted to do them because they were already booked up. 2) There is a daily parking fee, and the while we never had a problem parking at the resort, we did have to park a pretty good distance away at times.

Great things about this hotel: The beach is wonderful, in fact the best we'd been to in Hawaii. The water is blue and calm and you can snorkle right there. I ran two mornings. There is a 'beach walk' that is paved and goes through the cottages and around the gof course. From there, you can safely run on the road that goes up to the hotels on Black Rock. The bell hops and valet drivers were friendly and a great help. The room was modern and attractive and the bedding was comfortable. Whalers Village is within walking distance.

The people at the Royal Lahaina were incredibly hospitable and friendly. We were upgraded upon check-in to a deluxe ocean-view room on the 11th floor (of 12). The first night there we ate at the restaurant in the hotel, and the food was excellent, and very reasonably priced especially for Maui! I think the total including appetizer, a drink each, dinner, dessert, and tax and tip was around $70. Not bad given the beautiful beachfront atmosphere, and the romantic live music and dancer. The breakfast buffet (included in some packages) was quite sufficient, and the restaurant service was great! Did I mention you have the terrific option of adding 2 Mai Thais ($18 value) to your parking package everyday for only $6?! VERY worth it! =) We noticed the Royal Lahaina seemed to have far fewer children than other hotels, providing an even more romantic environment. The pool isn't as nice as some of the other hotels, and we never actually climbed in, but another couple told us it was a very comfortable temperature. The ocean water for us was as good as it gets. The snorkeling is awesome from this hotel ---10 minutes walk in either direction gave us better snorkeling rewards than our excursion snorkeling trip to Molokini and Lanai. We only had a couple complaints which were eventually taken care of by the hotel staff. --- We had booked a package that included a sunset-dinner cruise. Two days into our trip, we went to guest relations to pick the evening we would take the cruise, and we were told that the more desirable boat with the better dinner/drink option was completely booked. After complaining for a few minutes, the lady at guest relations called a manager (Corey) over. Corey listened attentively to my complaint, and he explained that when we booked the package it never specified which boat we would be on or what the menu would be (which is all true) but he promised to call the company we wanted to cruise with, and see if they could do anything. Eventually he told us if the cruise was completely booked, there was nothing he could do about that. Our options were that we could cruise on a different boat with a less desirable menu, or he could credit us some money back. Neither option sounded good to me, so I told him I would think about it. The next day he called and told us we could do a Cocktail cruise on the original boat of choice, and he would credit us with dinner. We agreed to this option, and were satisfied that he continued to show concern. A few hours later, Corey called me again, and said someone had canceled their sunset dinner cruise on the boat we had originally wanted, and if we wanted it, the open spots were ours, (which we happily accepted)! When we went to the desk to pick up our confirmation number for the sunset cruise, Corey handed us 2 of the most gorgeous leis (that we KEPT getting complimented on) that were hand made by the lady we had originally complained to in guest relations!!! What a great show of concern for their guests! =) The only other complaint, which really isn't their fault, was that the air conditioning went out, and could not be fixed for about 3 days because the part had to be ordered from the main land. This really only affected us at night because we were gone for most of the day anyway. And if you have enough drinks... you never notice the temperature anyway! =) What an amazing place!

True, they're not remodeled to look like the Marriott. They are very comfortable, clean, and the benefit of walking out the door onto the beach without tromping through a lobby or down an elevator was well worth the slightly \"older\" vibe. We would choose the same spot over the remodeled tower every time, but that's more our vibe anyway. At least in September this year, we didn't need the A/C on. We were in one of the end units and had windows on the front and side, so it was easy to get a little breeze blowing through the unit. And the little in-wall units were pretty loud as hotel A/C often is. I wished that our immediate neighbors would've left theirs off too, as it almost blocked out the sound of the waves and wind in the trees. We did run a little the first day, and then realized that it wasn't needed at all. We just kept anything of value in the safe and left the slider open all day, whether we were there or not and it was always nice when we got back. The beach right in front of our door ended up being one of our favorite on the island, and we visited a lot while we were there. The short walk to snorkeling (south, by Black Rock or north, in front of the Westin), the beach path for a run in the mornings, the great coffee and baked goods in the Royal Scoop, and the location near Whaler's Village and other restaurants we could walk to were just a few of the high points for us. It's a short drive up to Kapalua, and even closer to Lahaina's funky old town. One thing I'd recommend: while you can rent snorkel gear (and other beach stuff) by the day or hour at the hotel, it's MUCH cheaper to run to Lahaina and get a set at Snorkel Bob's (on your right before you get to Lahaina on Front St.). We also rented a set of fold up beach chairs, umbrella and cooler, but probably won't bother with those next time. But, the snorkel gear was great (we upgraded the masks to the middle level) and we used it everyday we were there. We didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff, but everyone we did talk with was very friendly and helpful. Check-in and out was fast and easy. Oh, a word on the parking... yes the luau happens most nights, but there was always room further back in the lot if the \"front\" lot was full. At least in the cottages, you're never parked outside your door anyway, so the extra 100 yards is not a big deal. You can always valet if it really matters that much to you. Also, the spots are very narrow, so the econo car we had was a plus. Even still there were always spots that were wasted because a few people can't seem to park inside the lines. Again, not a biggie, but slightly annoying. Also, we got the \"Parking package\" that included use of the safe, a newspaper, 2 mai-tais each day and parking for $16. We probably won't bother with that next time as we didn't get the drinks everyday or read the newspaper. We did use the safe all the time, and parking is $10 a day, so all in all, we probably still came out ahead with the drinks we did end up having on the days we were around the grounds. We saw signs that look like they're trying to get rid of the cottages for a more upscale set of condos or something. From our perspective, that would be a shame. We loved our cottage room, and are hoping it's still there for another trip next year. We loved the old-school Hawaii vibe without the big resort Disneyland trappings.

Usually \"paritial beach view\" is a tiny slice of water or sand that you have to lean off the balcony to see, but our view was incredible and you could actually see whales spouting in the distance from on our balcony. There was also a great view of the lush green mountians. Our room seemed newly rennovated with a Polynesian theme and a great bed. The cottages looked interesting and nice and close to the water. The only one we saw into though was the room they let us use to shower on our last day when we had to check out at noon, but didn't have a flight until 9pm. So it was nice that they give you the option to use a shower, but the cottage itself was run down and a little grody. Not sure if this is the standard, if so, I would not recommend the cottages. The resort had nice features and was very comfortable with a smaller intimate vibe. I preffered it much more to the mega-resorts that have hundreds of chairs on the pool deck, excessive activities and thousands of tourists. My only other advice that I wish I would have known earlier in our stay....if you're looking for a cheaper meal or just a sandwhich or snack during the day, the Royal Scoop downstairs in the resort is very convenient and affordable. I thought it was just an ice cream shop, but they have light breakfast items and sandwhiches that are much much cheaper than the resort restuarant, and easy if you just want something for the beach.

Our cottage had a door that connected to the room next door, which was loud when housekeeping started vacuuming, or people talked loud. It was like they were in the room. We also had been expecting a full kitchen and were surprised to only have a minifridge. I think the website was not exactly clear on this point, at least when we booked. We talked to a lady at the front desk (she seemed to be in her own little world), and we able to change rooms the next day. Our experience after that was much better. This room was on the corner and had a lot more windows with plantation shutter blinds (unlike curtains in the other room).

We put the do not disturb sign out every night just to be sure we were not woken up at 8:30 again. The cottages have been updated some, but the bathrooms are a little odd, clean, but odd. The glass part of the windows are plantation shutter style, so they don't keep out the heat really well. The first ac worked well, but the second one had trouble during the heat of the afternoon. Keep the ac on during the day while you're gone, and it'll be better. Parking was $10/day. We would stay there again, but we would make sure in advance our room is not in the 1st building we were in. We called and they came and picked us and our luggage up in a cart and took us to our car at check out. Great service because the parking lot was pretty far from our cottage, and it was a hot day. Only one computer for all the hotel, so if you need to print boarding passes, go EARLY in the morning when they open.

Even though there were other hotels in the same area I choose Royal Lahaina because of the price. This Resort is far from a resort. I would consider this a hotel. I state this because this location has a tower and cottages you can choose from staying in. I choose the cottages because it was more affordable. Bad choice. The cottages are outdated and remind me of some motel from the 1970's. I felt semi betrayed because they only show rooms from the tower on their website. I had a friend who stood in the towers and she said they were really nice. I assume the towers were remolded but the cottages are the ones that need to be molded. The staff is nice and ready to help but the service of the hotel is NOT VERY GOOD. Like everything on the island food stops serving at 9 (including room service). In the morning it was a journey just to order coffee and OJ from the breakfast lounge and we were told it would be a while not sure why since the lounge was empty but yet had a long line to go in.

You have the option to self park for $10 or valet for $15 since there's never self parking you are forced to pay $15 valet and defects the whole purpose if you are staying the cottages because you still have to walk (outside) around the hotel just to get to your room.

I requested to see the cottage before deciding and man am I glad I did! One of the bellboys gave us a ride to the cottage in the golf cart, even though it wasn't that far. The cottage's decor wasn't completely up to date but it room was clean, roomy, in good repair, and as close to the water as we could possibly get!

Having seen it myself, I can't believe the negative reviews I've read on here because our experience was completely the opposite. I read up a lot on here before our trip, so I want to return the favor to anyone considering the hotel. First: The location is awesome. Beautiful sandy beach, virtually empty every day, with clear blue water and some decent snorkling. Also within walking distance of Whaler's Village with restaurants/shops/other hotels. 15 minutes up or down the coast and we were at wonderful beaches or cute Lahaina for dinners/wandering around. If you don't have a car there are also trolleys that can take you some places, although I don't know why you wouldn't rent a car; Maui is great to explore. Second: Our room in the tower was beautiful. Comfy bed, beautfiully decorated. Partial ocean view was amazing from the 8th floor. We were on the south side of the building, which I think gave us a better view than the north side. We had breakfast on the balcony every morning and it was beautiful. I had mentioned it was a special anniversary and we were also treated to a suprise bottle of champagne. The cottages looked cute, but not nearly as nice. Third: The staff was incredible. Every single one of them that we dealt with was friendly, welcoming and excellent. The few requests we had (our bar fridge wasn't as cold as it should have been, we requested more mugs brought up, etc) were fullfilled within minutes. Fourth: The pools. I've read complaints here. I don't get it. You're in Maui. With a beach literally 10 feet away. With warm water. You don't need a pool. We couldn't have cared less that they weren't as fancy as the Sheraton next door as we didn't spend any time there. Poolside they have a giant bin of towels and you can grab all you need for the day and take them with you. We trekked all over Maui and tried out every beach we could. There was a cute bar/restaurant with live music every night and dancers. The music was always great and the bartenders really did make the best Mai Tais we had. The lobby had lots of character and pretty wood scrollwork and murals. Yes, you have to pay for parking. That's not uncommon at hotels and $10 isn't outrageous. I've seen up to $40 a night. Get the upgrade PV pkg and you get Mai Tais, a paper every day and use of the safe for $16 a day. It was worth it for us.

WOW. I am world traveled and this is the worst \"resort\" I have ever stayed in. The Royal Lahaina Resort completely ruined our trip. I would like to point out that we were in the TOWER that was suppposed to be fabulous. Our first room had a broken A/C and they knew it so we were forced to upgrade. Our second room was just over the bar and if you like to hear loud drunk men all night it would be great for you. Oh, and the night cap is the servers in the restaurant scraping the metal chairs against the slate to organize and close the bar. Our third room (which we were assured we'd love) had a beatiful view. HOWEVER, the room was not cooling off and we discovered there was no air flow coming through the vents. We picked up the phone to call maintenance and the phone didn't work! We used our cell phones to call the hotel and at midnight we had a man in our room changing the filthy air filter so we could actually get the room air conditioned. He was rude and left dirt all over the floor so we had to were our shoes in the room. Thinking all was well, we settled in to watch a little TV and guess what didn't work? The remote! It was so annoying. In addition you have to pay for parking every night and most nights there are very few spots if any because they have a cheesy luau for all people, not just guests. Which by the way you get to listen to every night. The beds were comfy, but were full size and the frames were for queens. Hence you would often bang your feet or knees on them. WHY on earth would they buy queen frames and use full size mattresses? Budget? Strange. The restaurant was horrible, so we either left the hotel or got sandwiches at the little store there. The ladies at the front desk were rude an not accomodating. Guest services was a man at a desk who handed you a form. REALLY!! The gentlemens desk crew was much better. Check your bill before you leave, we were double charged for parking and the couple next to us was also overcharged. They were clearly agitated as we were. So to sum this all up. This place is a scam. Do not listed to the manager and his pre-typed form replies to the negative comments. He has everything to gain by lying to you. WE DO NOT have anything to gain by being honest. While in the hotel, we tried to get ahold of him and he ignores you. All you will get from him is voicemail and you are lucky you will reach his secretary. They put you in a filthy room and force you into upgrading if you want to sleep or have A/C. Nothing is maintained which leads me to believe that perhaps they are going under and are resorting to unscrupulous practices to limp through their last days. Why else would they do a multi-million dollar renovation and skip the lobby ect? I would NEVER stay at this \"resort\" ever again.

We arrived late at night after a drive from the Kahalui airport, only to find that the room type we had booked was not available. We needed a room with two beds, but only a king was available. Disappointing, but we agreed to take it, with a roll away bed. We were told the roll away would be brought up right away - it was, and that the view from our room would be spectactular in the morning - it was! The manager said that a room would be ready in the morning (after the occupying party checked out) and that room was in fact an upgrade. We were excited as it was! The view overlooked the mountains and the villas and had a great view of the ocean - really something to wake up to every morning. Both rooms had a fridge and coffee maker, which was really helpful. The beds were comfy and it also included a radio/stereo that had those soothing sounds plus you could plug in your ipod. Also, nice HD TV. The staff overall was helpful, the bellmen, the conceirge, the maids, etc. Everyone greeted you when you passed by, and requested were tended too very promptly. The resort itself is large with lots of beach space. The beach never really gets crowded - and crowded on this beach is maybe 20 people!! (Much better than Waikiki!!) Water is crystal clear and the beach is litter free. There are a few pools around as well as rentals for water toys (rafts, etc.) Didn't use either, but they looked good. The luau is on premises - we didn't do it this trip, but have in the past and it's a good one to attend. We didn't try the restaurant this time, but walking through (you can walk through to access the pool/beach) the meals looked good and the customers happy. Also handy was the convenience store, the gift shop, the laundry facility, florist, conceirge, coffee/ice cream shop and jewellery store. The business centre lacked - just one computer to share for the whole resort. It was free, but there was a 15 minute limit when there were others waiting...the upside to this, the woman who maintains the shop gives you warm chocolate chip cookies while you surf the net!! The only downside was the parking. Given the size of the resort and the fact that people not staying at the resort can drive/park to attend the luau, sometimes parking was a good 5-10 min. walk away. No biggie given it's a nice walk through the little commerce area. Other things at the resort included tennis courts, italian restaurant, golf course and banquet hall. While we were playing on the beach, we saw a wedding taking place on the grounds just beside the luau area. It seemed like it would be private enough for the couple, but we got some glimpses of the ceremony. It looked beautiful and well organized. Definitely nice place to get married. The location is great - Kaanapali beaches are some of the best in Maui, so you can't go wrong here. I would suggest renting a car to get around - head to Whaler's Village in Lahaina. This is where most of the shopping is plus restaurants. The package we got actually included the car rental; however, we had to pay the taxes and upgraded insurance upon arrival. Parking was also $10 per day, but when you do the math, the package worked out better than renting the car separately. It was all pre-arranged and there was no trouble with the transaction. Overall, I highly recommend the Royal Lahaina Resort.

It was my parents and one of my brothers. I was the youngest at age of 21. I had a GREAT time there. The rooms are amazing. The decor is beautiful. The room had a nice balcony with an amazing view. Of course, the higher the balcony the better the view, but there was no bad view there. The beds are very comfortable, some of the best nights of sleep I ever got. The staff there is super friendly and very good at their job. My parents had been there at the same resort two years ago, and during our stay, one of the workers (appeared to be a manager of some sort) in the bar/restaurant came up to my father, shook his hand and called him by name...He remember who my father was from two years ago! The restaurant/bar is a great place, it is all open and looks out to the ocean. It also has a pool right there. Also, there is a little pathway to another pool with a smaller Tiki Bar next to it. Everynight they had a hula dancer and singer in the restaurant to entertain the guests. The first night we arrived at the hotel, we took our stuff to our rooms and then went down for a quick bit to eat and a few drinks. It was busy when we got down there. We were looking for a place to sit down, and a manager came up to us to see if he could help us. He quickly cleaned off a table for us and got our drink orders in. Every worker at the hotel is very helpful. Right by the front desk there is also a booth set up where you can go and book different events all over the island (parasailing, luau, snorkeling, diving, sunset cruise, etc.) The hotel also has a luau right on site. It is a great luau. In the summer months they have one every night as well. What I really love about this hotel is the location. It is not very hard to get to, and close to a couple good shopping places. But it isn't crowded. The beach isn't full of people. It is nice and quiet and relaxing! Also, it is just one building of rooms. It just has one tower so if a big group goes, they won't get spread way out all over, everyone will be in the same building. Also, there are little cottages you can rent as well. I know the hotel gets some bad rap for it being a little expensive. But everything down there is expensive. They are consistant to everything else around them. Going to Hawaii you have to expect to pay a little more. But it's really not that bad. I can't even begin to say how much I loved this place. It was my first time to Hawaii and I will not stay anywhere esle! I won't even give any other place a try. The only thing I would do is take a day or two to go to Honolulu and do the whole Pearl Harbor thing. But in my opinion. the Royal Lahaina resort is amazing!

The wedding was beautiful and the hotel wedding staff did a nice job with the details - location, flowers, music, cake, etc. The hotel is in a nice location for beach access and the beach walk. The beach is about 15 steps from the hotel pool. The view from the outside tables at the restaurant is exceptional. The bar/restaurant staff was quick and attentive and everything we ordered was pretty good - if expensive. Our room was decent and had the normal amenities. The hotel is located in a string of resorts on the beach. Warning - everything looks closer than it really is! We would make a decision to walk to another resort or Whalers Village for dinner and it was a lot farther away than most people in our group were prepared for (we were traveling with extended family including our older parents). Take advantage of the free Trolley that makes the rounds every 30 mins. Our complaints about the hotel are few. Everything was way more expensive than we are used to, but we read about it before we left so that we did not have sticker shock when we saw the bill. Our check in process was not helpful. We think the receptionist was new because she didn't do anything but look up our name and hand us a key - didn't tell us where to park, or give us a permit, or a hotel map, or explain the parking cost, or really let us know any helpful information. We learned more from other guests on our ride up to our room in the elevator than we did from the hotel staff. We tried to ask the front desk staff simple questions a few times about when the trolleys come or how far away something was and they always just said they didn't know. Our room location was horrible - we were on the 4th floor south side. Our view was a large AC unit. It obstructed any decent view and was noisy all the time. This would have been fine if we had paid less than the others in our group. However, all families in our party paid the same price (and it wasn't discounted) and we were the only ones with such a horrible location. Everyone else was on higher floors or on the North side of the hotel. The hotel was booked solid so we couldn't change rooms. My husband did not mind this but I wouldn't stay at this hotel again for this reason alone. We kept our blinds closed and didn't use the balcony except to dry clothes. Housekeeping came really early every morning - btw 8-8:30am. Each room gets 3 towels. We made the mistake one day of taking 2 of our room towels to the beach and so when our room got made up housekeeping only changed out 1 towel. Be sure to go grab beach towels out by the pool early so that you don't need to use your room towels. We highly recommend renting a car. There are several great snorkeling beaches w/i 20 miles. My husband saw tons of sea turtles and 1 shark! We had so many people in our group that at least 1 person tried every activity available on the island. We did not personally use the activities planner at the hotel but other people in our group gave her good reviews. We would recommend this hotel to travelers who maybe have been here before and don't need a lot of assistance or directions. We would probably not recommend this hotel to first time Maui visitors.

But the rooms in the tower! The teak furnishings and the graphic photos and the little touches of floral fabric give a real sense of place without being over the top. The platform bed was comfortable -- it had a down mattress pad -- and there was a feather pillow in the closet for people like me who HATE foam pillows. The room felt spacious. I loved the sliding louvered doors instead of curtains at the lanai, along with the louvered panel in the sink/vanity area of the bathroom -- I could enjoy my view as I brushed my teeth! The room had a big closet and plenty of storage space so all the luggage, clothes and toiletries could be tucked away with no clutter to mar the beauty of the room. My one criticism is that the safe was locked and when I called security to come open it they never showed up. Oh, and they charge $10 a day to park. That being said, the front desk staff, the bellmen, the housekeeping staff, the pool attendant and the bartender were all pleasant, efficient, and professional.

Get the mai-tai package, it is worth it. This is Maui, so try to relax and don't spend too much time running around and avoid time share presentations like the plague (unless you want to buy one).

We stayed on the 5th floor in the newly renovated rooms. We had booked our trip off travelocity and had a \"partial ocean view\" room reserved. When we arrived at the Royal Lahaina, we inquired about upgrading our rooms. We were offered excellent discounted rates and shown the available cottages and beach front rooms. As it was, our partial ocean view was excellent and we stayed with our original reservation. The room was comfortable, a nice view and I really liked the way the room was designed and remodeled. Services: The hotel's services were very good. The housekeeping staff was always very friendly and prompt on requests for extra pillows, blankets and any other items requested. The Bell hops and valet parking attendants were always courteous and friendly. The front desk attendants were friendly as well. I reviewed the restaurant separately, as most of its service was appalling. The restaurant's service was not a reflection of the rest of the hotel's staff who were friendly, courteous and a pleasure to be around. Complaints about the hotel: The few complaints I have about my stay here revolve around no free internet, it was $10 a day. The Hotel does give a guest services down stairs next to the coffee shop which provides free internet (15 minutes) and printing services for boarding passes etc. This was more than adequate for our internet usage, since we were on vacation, but it would have been nice to be able to check email from our room. The other complaint, which wasn't a big deal either, was that we were on the south side of the hotel. We had a spectacular view of Black Rock, however, the air conditioning unit was kind of loud when the door was open. The sliding door for the balcony filters out all of the noise when closed, but when open, the noise was evident. Other than these two minor complaints, I loved my room. I would recommend this hotel.

(they didn't skimp on anything just because they were cheaper.) oh and the musician (singer/guitarist) and dancer they got to perform each night at the hotel restaurant/bar were great! i normally find that stuff cheesy but it was just soooo good. the singer had the most beautiful voice i've heard. since then we've been to many places with singers but none can compare. you can even just sit there by the pool and listen without buying anything. also, they had a snorkel shack and even though we brought our own gear (so much cheaper than renting) the guy there taught us how to use it and also sprayed them to de-fog the masks. and when my mom's flipper got messed up he tried to help fix it! all just to be nice, which was great. he told us about the tours he sold but definitely didn't push us to go on them (which we didn't since the free snorkeling was so great!) definitely stay in the royal lahaina next time you're in maui!", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreate location, loved our stay.\u201d", "Author": "famtrav4_10", "ReviewID": "UR67844960", "Content": "We stayed here for 6 nights and loved every minute.

The resort is older, but as recommended we requested our room to be in the tower a partial ocean view. We utilized the hospitiality suite on our day of departure to shower before our flight and as suggested the cabins are not worth the price. We had booked our stay with AARP/Expedia as we found this to be the biggest savings for the room/car rental package. When we arrived for a late check-in we were given the option to upgrade for a upgraded fee, but select to stay with the room we had selected. We were on the 7th floor with a partial ocean view, the room was small, the beds are comfortable, carpet was stained, air conditioning is on some type of programmed timer and the nights became warm when trying to sleep. The lighting in the sink area made it almost impossible to make-up or to shave, very dim. This is a non-smoking resort as it appears that most properties in Maui are. If you are a smoker, there is a small area outside the lobby with ashtrays and we actually met some really nice people here, smoking is also allowed on the beach. The pool area is older, but comfortable never had to wait for a lounge chair poolside. Very nice beach, no chairs on the beach. The resort dining is over priced for the quality of food and appeared to be understaffed. We only ate one dinner and one breakfast there. Our favorite dining was at Whaler's Village at Leilani's their wait staff was excellant. My recommendations for the resort are the following, park in the valet parking for the extra fee - self parking problems are the spaces are very small and it is a distance from the hotel - also, our rental car was hit by someone and when we spoke to hotel security their response was if you would have parked in valet we would take responsibility, but not in self park. If you are a coffee drinker, in room coffee is terrible and the coffee shop/ice cream shop does not open until 6 AM if you are an early riser and on a different time zone you will wish you had purchase your own coffee maker.

Yes the bathrooms are in desperate need of being updated but I don't know about you but I was not planning on staying much of my time there in the bathroom. It was fabulous to be able to come back from sightseeing and get to hang out on our back porch enjoing some \"beverages\" , sunning then be able to go run into the water without having to go through the main building. All the staff were so friendly. It was great to come back and be greeted with \"Welcome Home\". It was also nice that they cleaned our rooms twice a day which was convenient when going to the beach and coming back to shower and have them replaced by the time you are back from dinner. We also splurged on room service one night and for the price, which at first was frightening, you get really good portions. Another deal was the paradise parking package. For the $16 you get a daily paper,use of the safe and 2 mai tais daily(and they are not watered down if you were wondering, was tipsy after one. ) The mai tais alone cost $15.50 for 2. A sacrifice of being in the cottage is that the parking lot is a good walk away but it was totally worth it. The spots in the lot are also extrmely tight so beware of dings.

I first had a supprise package delivered to the hotel and called ahead and warned them that it was our anniversary and wanted this package available upon arrival. They pulled it off fantastic and upgraded my room because of my anniversary and they had rooms available. This is a beautiful resort and upon driving in, the gate person welcomed us as to \"home\" and each time we left and came back in, the same man would tell us, \"welcome back home\". He made you feel special. The hotel was super nicely laid out with lost of nice things in it. It has a laundry mat nearby in the resort grounds to do laundry and machines were nice. The resteraunt was nice and mildly expensive but not as bad as many and they have a nightly hula lady and hawaiian singer with guitar and was very good. The beach is so-so since it has no cabanas or lounge chairs on it to sit by the beach but still nice beach and view. You can see the whales when in season from hotel room or on beach and while swimming in beach, you can even hear the whales calling each other. The rooms were nicely laid out and not huge, but had plenty of room. Bathrooms were small with shower stall but no tub. Had only small sink in area just outside bathroom and has a nice balcony to overlook ocean and watch whales. Rooms were pretty modern and was told they just had major renovations and everything was nice. This place was recommended from a friend and I will also recommend it to others. The Luau at the hotel is a little cheesey and put on and believe the others would be better from what I am told, but with hotel discount, it was decently priced. The staff was super nice here and has a coffee shop and ice cream shop on the grounds also. Needs better parking as it competes with the Luau and gets crowded but always found a place but not as close as without competing with Luau. This is definately a keeper and nicely located close to Lahaina to see or do activities. Shopping is expensive near Lahaina compared to prices by airport but it is too far away for short trips there for better prices. Still, this is the west end of the island and the whales are abundant on this end of island. We found a very secluded dark sand beach a few miles away and we were by ourselves for a great getaway. The sunsets are not as good as on Oahu due to the other islands get in the way of the sunset going down over the ocean. Still nice views and we saw rainbows every day in the area and we stayed 7 days here. Well worth it and we will return again to this hotel. It is a keeper and thanks again to the staff and handling my special requests. I was warned to stay away from the cabins and stay in the main tower that has recently remodeled and the cabins were not. Didn't look at them myself, but talked to a couple that said they would have rather got the main tower rooms instead of cabins. The swimming pool was located right next to the restaraunt and to me is poorly located and saw very few visit it. Had numerous tennis courts and nice looking ones also. Parking is $10 per day and had wireless internet and although it is is supposed to charge after a period, I never got charged but may have not used it long enough. House keeping was good, but had to ask for wash cloths twice and also soap and shampoo once. Room has nice sized safe in it and small refridgerator but didn't get very cold and could not find adjustment. Overall, a super nice hotel/resort and will come back.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNice if you are in the tower\u201d", "Author": "love_beach_holiday", "ReviewID": "UR58902949", "Content": "I booked this resort through Expedia.

On arrival into the beautiful lawns you are greated by a lovely Man welcoming to your new home, which was a great thing to hear after a long day out exploring. We decided on the valet option at $16 per day, the sbell staff were fantastic and never once hinted for a tip. Our room on the 10th floor looked over the ocean and golf course, an amazing view. Since also being our honeymoon were received a bottle of champagne, which was delicious. The rooms were very spacious and well looked after. The bathroom was a little small, but the lovely shower made up for this. Housekeeping was amazing, and even thanked us for saving them extra work on one day when my husband wasn't feeling well and spent most of the day in bed. Even referring to us by name. The restaurant within the resort was pretty good. We only ate their once, but decent food and wonderful cocktails. I recommend the cocktail in the pineapple. Amazing!! We purchased our own breakfast materials, as we weren't all that keen on paying $20 each for breakfast every morning. The pool, although the area not so inviting, the view of the beach was just amazing, with happy hour at the Pool Side bar well worth it! $5 Mai Tais, which were the best I had while on vacation. With the beach on our door step, we rarely used the pool and swam in the ocean, which was usually warmer than the pool anyway. Which was never crowded and felt as though you had most of it to yourself. The Luau within the resort is also a must! Although being from Australia, we didn't think too highly of the buffet (mainly the side dishes) although the Pig was to die for. We also ate at the Italian restaurant at the entrance of the resort, which for the price, wasn't really worth the prices they charge. Although the Banana dessert certainly made up for that. One restaurant we were recommended by the wonderful lady at the Activities Centre (nearest to the lobby) in Whaler's Village. Leilani's on the beach was amazing.

We were booked into a cottage which I was absolutely dreading having read some horrific reviews on TripAdvisor about cockroaches and all sorts! However, I found the cottage more than adequate. It was clean, comfortable and really peaceful. We actually enjoyed the feeling of being detached from the hotel. Being on our honeymoon we liked the peace and quiet by our cottage and ate breakfast on our own personal patio table and chairs in the sunshine almost every morning. We had a large fridge which we found really useful for storing drinks and food, there was also a large cupboard which we kept crisps and breakfast cereal in; there is a safeway a 2minute driveaway so you can really save some money on food and drink if you make a quick trip. We also tried some more local foods at the Safeway such as Poke which I think was raw spicy squid, it was good! The Safeway is attached to a small shopping mall where we bought flippers and snorkel masks which we put in the boot of our car and explored the beaches of Maui. Our favourite was 'Turtle Beach' in Molokai, lots of turtles everytime we visited even in the shallows! We ordered room service the first night as we were too tired to go out exploring, it was average food for an OK price. We didn't even bother eating at the hotel as the prices were quite high. Hotel staff were OK but to be honest we had absolutely minimal contact with them. We had a complimentary bottle of champagne when we arrived along with complimentary local newspapers delivered to our door each day which were nice extras. The beachfront was absolutely lovely and never too busy; great for sunbathing and evening walks. We also found the bath in the cottage although wasn't the most attractive was very large and big enough for two easily. The car park was often busy and sometimes had to park quite far away; not too much of a problem just was a little bit annoying after long days out. We spent a lot of time out of the hotel exploring the Hana Highway, Oheo Gulch, Iao Needle, Molokai and Lahaina all of which I would recommend.

The help is very rude too. If you do decide to stay at the resort anyway don't stay in the cabins, only the hotel part is nice the cabins are the \"original\" resort. The cabins have disgusting showers not only does brown water come out when you first turn it on they look like no one ever cleans them too.

The resort is very close to lahania and all the shops on front street. Use the valet parking on front street in Lahaina to save yourself from walking so far. The buffet breakfast in the lobby is very high and probably not worth the money. The sites of Maui are great and the beach at the resort is seriously like having a private beach. You have a perfect view of the Black Rock and within walking distance for snorkeling. The resort is about 25-30 minutes from the airport & very easy to find. The front staff was always kind and helped us place reservations for local restaurants in town. My wife also enjoyed the pineapple water each time we came back through the lobby.

Although the location is great, the beach is on the quieter side of black rock by far, and the rest of Maui is paradise, we were quite disappointed with our stay at this hotel. We have travelled extensively for years and are not ones to complain but I do want to let people know that although you may be getting a better deal at this hotel, it is for good reason. We unfortunately were put in a room overlooking the golf course and had a partial oceanview right above the exhaust from the restaurant below which kept us up all night and the fumes never subsided. There was absolutely no room for either of us to unpack our things as there was one tiny closet with only three hangers, no drawers or chest of any kind to put our things. We did not have a table on our deck, only two chairs which turned out okay since we couldn't relax with the nonstop fumes and noise from the exhaust. The bathroom was very poorly lit and housekeeping would not come in everyday. The area around the hotel is gorgeous but if you take a short walk and see the other accomodations in the area you will be sad that you are returning to this hotel. The two pools are merely three sizes larger than your bathtub and were kept very cool. The expensive breakfast is very average food but nice to have there if you don't want to venture out too far. They don't allow you take any chairs or loungers down to the beach and the \"bar\" is a tiny shack by one of these tubs. They are no shady spots on this beach and you will have to fight over the few palm trees on the grassy area. I don't agree with being charged parking while you are their \"guest\". Add that to your rate and call it a day, why nickle and dime? The staff at the hotel were cold and we found them to be unapproachable. The housekeeping started vaccuuming the outside halls as early as 8 or 9 am. The poor ones that would check in very late from a long flight and wake up to that. The newspaper at your door in the morning was a hit and miss.

I do not need hot tubs and bars in pools, etc. The decor was dark plantation and the sheets were white and crisp adding a contrast to the wooded shutters. The large sliding glass doors opened to our own little patio with 2 chairs and a table. We saw whales from the balcony, as well as a double rainbow. Air conditioner worked well as did eveything, I phoned about our phine and it was fixed as I asked. The shampoos, conditioner, lotions and soap were high quality and after useage we were delighted to smell like coconut and lime. Always plentiful as the maids made sure you did not run out. Maid service was prompt and efficient and room service great. We had stopped at the local safeway grocery store and filled our mini-fridge with water and snack foods The beach is white and the ocean is torquoise blue, beckoning you to enter. It is very swimmable and almost vacant or tourists. We spent every day taking a dip in the ocean...and if you walk up north by a few hotels you can find one of Lahaina's public beach which offers a great snorkelling reef - eels, humuhumus, angelfish, etc. are abundant. We snorkeled Black Rock twice and were lucky to see another sea turtle. We also snorkled in front of the Sherton Hotel ( most people were in their pools, which are beautiful but could have been in any large city) but the wind was blowing and we found it very rocky and no fish of any amount. We had a rental car, but used the free shuttle that goes from hotel to hotel when we were staying close to home due to the high cost of parking in the parkades. Whaled watched with the Pacific Whale group and it was good not too many whales as it was early Dec and I hear Jan and Feb are better.

Rooms in the tower were indeed nice, I'm sure comprable with the nicer 4 star resorts. Please make SURE you stay in the towers if you want guaranteed 3.5 star rooms! Do not gamble on the cottages. We walked by and into a few of the rooms (during housekeeping), some are well-updated, some just so so.

We were busy exploring the island, so we'd take a morning swim few laps, so not a big deal for us. Luau - very average. The kahlua pig is dry. Bud lite is delicious tho :) One final comment: If you work at the front desk, you should be friendly, not surly. The lady who checked us in intially was just not very nice.

We enjoyed everything about the hotel, from the outstanding treatment we received to the luxury and comfort of our hotel room. Based on the reviews we read, we booked an ocean view room in the newly renovated tower. But because we were on our honeymoon, the hotel upgraded us to the top floor. We got a gorgeous, full ocean view off the balcony and a lovely bottle of champagne in the fridge waiting for us. This warm welcome is the perfect example of how well we were treated during our stay. The room looked just like the pictures. Brand new, tastefully furnished, with luxury linens and high end bath soaps/lotions/etc. I believe the room itself was on par with any of the Sheratons or Hiltons I've stayed at. Coupling that with a balcony and a breathtaking view of the ocean, well, we couldn't have been happier. Even though we didn't have a microwave, we were sort of prepared for that. We wanted to stay in a resort hotel, as opposed to a condo with a fully equipped kitchen. We planned on enjoying the great food on the island instead of cooking for ourselves. The Royal Lahaina had everything we wanted. We were right on the beach. There were two beautiful running paths, one by the beach and the other through the golf courses. BTW, those same running paths bring you to the Sheraton and Kaanapali Beach Hotel, so we got to see the other side of Black Rock and have drinks at their hotel bars. We also liked the free shuttle to Whaler's Village and the Lahaina Shuttle stop. We were glad we took the advice of other reviewers and valet parked our rental car. It was quick and easy, and we got to know the hotel staff a little better. And I just can't say enough about how good the customer service was. Everyone was really pleasant and friendly. There were so many other things the hotel offers - a nice pool, a bar & restaurant, a luau, even tennis and golf. But we had so much to do elsewhere on the island, we just ran out of time! One thing I'd warn others about is Kaanapali Beach itself (and this is all of it, not just in front of Royal Lahaina). This is no reflection on the hotel - this is just in case someone reading this isn't a strong swimmer. The water was rough while we were there. We heard about two horrible beach accidents happening within days of each other. We visited other beaches within driving distance, and many seemed safer (one had no waves at all). I don't swim too well, and was glad we had a car to find calmer beaches. That being said, the bottom line is this. If you want to stay in a Kaanapali resort hotel with an ocean view, Royal Lahaina is a great place. Besides being more affordable, I think you're getting about the same amenities as the larger chains (whose rooms may be older and worse for wear). I'd even be willing to bet very few of them have the same views (unless you're willing to pay triple the price). To me, that's just throwing away your money.

Since I had already been rejected for Wailea alone, I added Lahaina and decided to \"pull the handle\" on a 3.5 star hotel for $130 a night (hoping and praying that it would be Wailea and NOT Lahaina). Well, my gamble was a bust...OR SO I THOUGHT!!! When I saw that it was the Royal Lahaina I started getting sick to my stomach. How in the world could I have gambled $7000 on a hotel I had never stayed at in a location I didn't even know? All I could recollect of Lahaina was the long shopping promenade filled with exorbitant art galleries and that Forest Gump restaurant. Made me want to \"Run, Forest, Run!\" just at the thought of it. I even unsuccessfully begged a haggard priceline.com employee to let me out of this obligation (since not 24 hours later a tree had fallen on our car, also ripping out the power, cable and phone to our home). Evenutally my fiance had patted my head long enough to calm me down and suggested I just 'play it where it lies'...which is a better golf analogy than a gambling analogy. We took the kids (5 between us) and the parents (4 between us) and headed out to Maui on June 22, 2009. Aside from a layover in the city we left from (yes, we flew an hour and half only to have to turn around back to Seattle for a medical emergency (P.S. - hearing a flight attendant as he walks briskly down the aisle ask, \"is there a doctor on the plane\" is NOT something one who hates flying should ever hear?) So, 10 hours later (of a 6 hour flight) we had made our destination to our favorite island of Maui. We were \"welcomed home\" in the aloha fashion by the guards at the resort. As we checked in we were charmed by the chilled wet lavender-infused wash clothes and the ice cold water with large slices of fresh pineapple. The staff were welcoming and professional and when they found out we were getting \"maui'ed\" they upgraded 2 of our rooms to water views. Our parents received the garden rooms and they were able to watch the golfers try to avoid the walkers pushing their baby carriages along the beach path and the hotel's beautiful garden areas. The decor was dark plantation and the sheets were white and crisp adding a succulent contrast to the wooded shutters. The large sliding glass doors opened to our own little patio with 2 chairs and a table: a perfect setting to sit back with a cup of complimentary coffee while watching the surf hit the shore. The shampoos, conditioner, lotions and soap were high quality and after useage we were delighted to smell like coconut and lime. My mother-in-law swore by a good coconut lotion dousing after a day spent too long in the sun. Maid service was prompt and efficient and room service was a bit pricey but necessary after our long trip. We stopped at the local grocery store and filled our mini-fridge with yogurts, and snack foods and our cupboards with cereal and papayas (the PERFECT Maui breakfast - 1/2 papaya, yogurt and granola - and the papaya acts as it's own bowl) and purchased a brita water filter to avoid having to buy bottle after bottle of water. The pool was always a perfect temperature and the lounge chairs were always available. The wind, so strong in June, took a heavy wood chaise lounge and drug it right into the pool...so beware of what you let free when you're laying there. The beach is white and the ocean is torquoise blue, beckoning you to enter. It is very swimmable and almost vacant or tourists. We spent every day taking a dip in the ocean...and if you walk up north by a few hotels you can find one of Lahaina's public beach which offers a great snorkelling reef - eels, humuhumus, angelfish, etc. are abundant. When we got hungry we took the whole family to the buffet, which was a bit pricey for what was offered but everybody walked away satiated. At night the restaurant offers live music and hula dancing and we were among the lucky to go up and dance with the beautiful hula lady. And, God forbid, pictures were taken. Needless to say, we were very satisfied with our experience. One drawback is the elevators - which you'll see mentioned in other reviews. There is usually one that is broken (of the three) and it does take a while to get down to the lobby. There were many times that we decided to grab a little exercise and just take the stairs. It was both fun and good for us. In December of 2009 we came back to the Royal Lahaina - this time getting the room for $110/night through priceline.com. We were offered an upgrade if we didn't like the cottage room but once we went inside and got the feel of it, we were hooked. This is, without question, \"Old School\". The cottages have not been updated, the showers are a bit square and large and strange and the pillows were a bit lumpy but we loved this room even more than the tower rooms.

The room was incredibly small, had terrible privacy from the nighbours (5 other units in the \"cottage\",the air con had no remote, the TV was old school on its last legs, the room had not been refurbished for at least 15 years. Worst of all the \"beachfront\" outside our room had the resorts swimming pool in between us and the beach - so instead of a romantic little place where we could sit outside our room and watch the waves break we could sit outside our room and share the experience with dozens of people lounging around the pool. We had to keep all our curtains closed otherwise people walking past could see us lying in bed. You could not even see the beach unless you stood up and peered over the bushes! One day we recieved a note saying that there would be no water or air-con in the resort from 9-5pm next day - what a joke - we had to leave the resort to go to the toilet. Twice in the middle of the night there were false fire alarms forcing the evacuation of our rooms. The in house entertainemt was terrible with the same singer singing the same mournul songs every night for 9 nights. The swimming pools and bars were not much better than what you would see in a decent back yard.

I think some new deck furniture would enhance the second pool. The grounds were clean and well maintained. The restaurant was really good.

That is in fact what they tried to put us in. Most all of the partial ocean view rooms look out over the ugly brown roof with bird crap all over it and duct work. The balcony of our room had dried bird poop on the rails and dried coffee stains all over the little cheap table. I honestly never saw one staff person smile. They were down right rude at best. The restaurant was way over priced and the waitress ridiculed us for only ordering 1 breakfast to share. I have had gastric surgery and only eat a few bites and her behavior embarrassed me.

After waiting a few minutes I was advised that we could further upgraded to the one bedroom suite for a small extra nightly fee. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen this room on the website and was delighted and agreed to the extra fee, it was our wedding week after all! The room was on the 11th floor and was gorgeous. 2 lanai with table and chairs and one on the other side too. It had spectacular views out the mountains and the oceanfront. There were 2 bathrooms, the main one being huge with a beautiful free standing bath and 2 sinks, with a dressing area too. I did wonder why there were no bathrobes, and it took 2 days for me to discover that there should have been, it then took 2 calls to get them brought to the room. That's probably the only downside though! We took the valet parking deal and the valet guys were great, very helpful with local suggestions too. We splurged on valet, but I don't think its really necessary, its not that far to walk to the self parking lot at all. Also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with the mai tai deal with parking unless you plan on being around the pool al lot and drinking during the day. We found the bar in the hotel was closed by 9.30 most nights and we couldn't get our free drinks. They wouldn't roll them over to the next day either. The two pools are on the small side but have plenty of beds around them for laying out. And you are step away from the beautiful beach and pacific ocean too. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to snorkel, but my friends say they saw lots of fish right off the beach. The hotel provides beach towels which was handy. We had the buffet breakfast one morning which was nice, but not sure if it was worth $20 per person. We walked to Whaler's Village a few times for dinner which was great, and went to the Luau the night before our wedding which was also very good. We hired a car for the duration of our stay, and I'd say that if you are going to be there for more than 2 or 3 days this is a must. We did some really fun things during our stay in addition to getting married, I'd recommend the zipline tour at Kanaapali - the guides there are amazing fun, we also biked down the volcano but unfortunately got a cloudy day, and we had a private surf lesson, so much fun! The lobby was lovely, seemed really Hawaiian. Having read some reviews I was expecting the hotel to be a bit shabby, but it wasn't at all. I did have friends who stayed in a cottage room.

I scoured the internet for months looking for the best hotel/condo to stay in on Maui. I have NO regrets staying at Royal Lahaina. The hotel itself is as magical as Maui itself. When I walked into our room Sunday evening after a LONG flight, I was immediately at ease. There was an absolutely breathtaking view of the ocean and sunset. I just melted. Not to mention the rooms are nicely decorated. I loved all the wood decor. The tile shower was great and relaxing. Also their toiletries were really nice. It was a lime coconut scent that was really good. The next morning we ate breakfast at the hotel. It was REALLY good buffet. I thought it was pricey ($20 per person), but actually after eating at other restaurants, this is actually a good deal. If you want something quick and light, they have a little cafe on the premises that sell bagels, donuts, fruit, juice etc. We ate there a couple times. The pool area is cozy and is right in front of the ocean. If I could go back I would do a few less activities and spend more time just enjoying the hotel. I just smiled the whole time I walked around the hotel. There is light hawaiian music playing everywhere. It just oozes Aloha. It wasn't a crowded hotel either which was great. Lots of people we met on various activities bragged they were staying at more expensive Sheraton or Westin, but we walked around those places, and it wasn't really worth the money from what we saw. The location of this hotel is also perfect. It is right near Black rock which has AWESOME snorkeling just a few feet from the beach. It was like swimming in a fish aquarium. I didn't see any sea turtles though =( RL is also close to Whalers Village which is REALLY nice! I wish we had've check it out sooner than our last night. Plus the hotel is right off the 30 highway which easily gets you anywhere on the island quick. ABout 10 minutes from Lahaina and 30 minutes to airport. I PRAY that we can go back soon. I truly left my heart in Maui. I plan on staying at Royal Lahaina. It is the best deal with an amazingly cozy hotel. (PS-I read reviews about slow elevators, but we were staying on the top 12th floor and had no waiting at all. They were pretty fast to me) (PSS- Check out CJ's deli. The food is GOOOOOD and fairly reasonable. It is right near the hotel at the Kaanapali Fairway Shops) (PSSS- Check out Hula Grill in Whaler's Village.

We spent 9 days theere for our second anniversary in June 2009. We had a non-ocean view room in the tower, but we could still see the ocean off of our balcony. Since the hotel is on the opposite side of black rock as most of the Kaanapali hotels, we basically had a private beach during our stay. There was pretty good snorkeling near the Sheraton on the other side of black rock. It is just a short walk through the Sheraton to that part of the public beach. It is also a quick walk to Whalers village from the Royal Lahaina. We used the expedia travel services on site at the hotel to book our excursions. It was very convenient and the prices were about average. It is defnitely important to book your excursions either before you go or on your first day, because tours fill up fast. The pools are average and it can be hard to find beach chairs at times, but we don't like to sit around a whole lot on vacation so that was fine. I can sit around at home, so there is no need to do it on vacation. Some people complained that there were no parking spaces, but what they really meant was that there were no close parking spaces. We NEVER had trouble finding parking, but did have to walk from the end of the farthest lot a few times. It certainly was not something I would say was negative about the resort. The one thing I would rate negatively was the elevator. It sometimes took 10 minutes or more for an elevator to come. This is even more of a problem, because there are really no stairs that you can use. They really need to do something about their elevators.

May be complaining about the cottages is getting tiring, but I have to put in my two cents here. We booked our honeymoon as a package, and were told the cottages were nice and less expensive, so we gave them a shot ( as a package, I honestly don't know the price we paid ). When we arrived at the hotel, it was friendly enough and after check in we were given a small tour of the facility on our way to our cottage on a golf cart ( nice touch I thought but may be common place nowadays ). The cottage appeared nice initally until a closer inspection. The whole place seemed way outdated, and the sliding doors on the closets couldn't even stay on the rails. The AC worked, but struggled. The bathroom, in all honesty, was an embarrassment. The bathtub was stained, there was chipped paint all over the place, and the shower was extremely hard to regulate ( we never once had a shower with a setting we were comfortable with ). And the toilet....I can't even begin to describe. It was so bad at flushing that I once had to flush it FIVE times to clear everything. And two times we found small lizards crawling around ( a small cockroach too ). I guess being in the tropics this might be somewhat common, but in what is supposed to be a luxury resort, I found it unacceptable. We thought about complaining and going to the tower ( and trust me, we NEVER complain, it just isn't our nature ) but we decided to stick with it and it ended up being ok. The maid service could have been better, as we got some dirt on our sheets and they were never changed. One time the maid didn't come until almost 4 oclock. The privacy was nice though, even though the locks are very cheap. One thing too that I didn't care for is the room keys themselves. They are about the size of a padlock key. Even though we never lost them, they easily could be. The biggest problem I had though, is that we got locked out of our cottage TWICE. Once is a mistake, twice is a habit. The first time the maid was still in the area, and we were able to get in. The second time, however, we had to walk to the front desk and tell the girl we were locked out and it wasn't our fault. She said ok but never apologized. They sent maintenance, he couldn't get in ( and seemed annoyed at us ) and he called housekeeping who finally got in. NOBODY apologized ( though the housekeeper was pleasant). This was annoying this time because we had a long day of driving and we were looking forward to relaxing in our room. I still can't understand why the maid locked the door from the inside. The fact that nobody apologized ddin't help any. The rest of the resort is pretty good I guess. The restaurant at the beach was very pricey I thought, and the beach was nice and quiet. Most of the workers were pleasant, and the ladies at the activities desk were very helpful. But pretty good for a luxury resort isn't good enough. The whole place just seems outdated and in need of an overhaul. The parking is very crowded, and the spots themselves are very narrow, barely allowing room to open the car door. The luau I thought was real good, but I thought it was going to be on the beach and a bit longer. Looking back I wish we had asked to be upgraded to the tower, but I am the type ( my wife too ) that understand that people make mistakes and not everything is perfect.

We were upgraded to this as we just pricelined the room. Our family (an infant, a three year old and a nine year old) all were in the room. The bathrooms were large. The tub was quite deep. There was a mini fridge in between the double sinks, very large closets. The room was average sized and had two double beds. There was a tv, a chair and two small tables. The back was was entirely glass doors and sliding shutters. The patio area was concrete, had a full sized table and chairs, over looked a grassy area then a pool, then the ocean. This is an ocean property and like all Maui property it isn't new. However, it was clean and sweet. It isn't shiny. It isn't the Ritz, but the room size is the same :) We did the breakfast buffet in the morning, it was wonderful. The prices weren't bad for Maui. The made on demand omelets were fantastic, there was tons of stuff for everyone. We sat outside and overlooked the ocean and pool. It was heavenly. We did a bit of time in the ocean before our flight and it was our favorite beach. It was so clear that you could read a book through the water. The waves and sand on this stretch of the beach were the best were saw on our 14 day trek. It was beyond amazing. Check out was super easy.

From the moment we arrived (after 12 hours of flying from the US East Coast), we experienced truly genuine friendly hospitality from everyone at the resort.

The pools seemed perfectly fine to us but we came to Maui for the beaches. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are more lavishly landscaped pools on the island but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pay a lot more for them. We thought the towels (available poolside or at the front desk) to take to the beach or out & about was a super perk (that much less to pack in your suitcase). Just bring them back and the next day there was a huge bin with fresh ones to grab! On the subject of the beach, the stretch outside the Royal Lahaina was beautiful, clean, and free of sharp rocks. Our room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. We had plenty of drawer/shelf/closet space; we actually brought too many clothes as we lived in our bathing suits most of the time. The lobby and main restaurant areas were also very nicely decorated and not at all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outdated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as some other travelers commented. The lobby & room decorations suited the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location; did these people that had negative comments on the decor think they were going to Paris/LA/etc? We did notice a little water dripping down the door casing divider from the shower/toilet area to the sink area. However we went down to the front desk & reported it, went to breakfast and upon our return to the room, it was all fixed and didn't occur again. We were very pleased at the speed & efficiency of the repair! The valet parking was well worth the $5 extra a day and we gave the guys a few extra dollars each time they ran to retrieve our car (and they really hustled\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6never had to wait more than a minute or 2 for our car). We enjoyed talking to the valets and they gave us great suggestions on places to go (including a great non-tourist sushi place where we ate wonderful sushi for next to nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Genki\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just down the street from the hotel). They even asked us how our day was & what we did when we returned to handover the keys for them to park our car upon our return. On the subject of tips, people need to keep in mind that all the locals working in the hotels, restaurants, etc., usually work multiple jobs to keep up with the cost of living and they appreciate an extra bit here & there. We are by no means wealthy but this was our 25th anniversary trip and something we've been saving up for (even though we've had our share of expenses with 3 kids). I guess we identify with the locals. There are so many things to do both on-property and around the island. We took advantage of the free yoga classes and there were also sign-ups for other activities in the lobby. We also spent time talking to the locals (at restaurants, shops, and just out & about all over the island). They were all so nice and we enjoyed our conversations with them. Give them some respect; Maui is their home and they graciously allow us tourists to experience their beautiful island!

It was by far the worst resort/hotel experience ever. We booked one of the cottages for three nights. When we checked in we were impressed with what we thought was a guard stand at the entrance of the resort. Having heard several stories about tourists having their belongings stolen in Maui, we wanted to be sure we were staying in a place that had some functional security measures. We approached a jovial gentleman manning the station; he greeted us and sent us onward to register at the front desk after verifying our reservation. Upon entering the lobby there is ice cold pineapple water and fresh damp towels to cool off with. Having just left a different resort on Oahu that offered fresh pineapple juice upon your arrival, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as refreshing but it was appreciated none the less. As I checked in my husband waited with the Jeep in front of the hotel. Even though the lobby was empty, the front desk staff was noticeably distracted and seemed somewhat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by my presence but I was eventually greeted. I made it a point to let them know that it was our honeymoon. They proceeded to prepare our room keys and were educated on the $10 per night parking fee. Having noticed that the parking lot was near-full on the way in I was a bit concerned with having to compete for parking so I asked what happens if someone steals your paper parking tag from your convertible vehicle. The answer I received was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you a new one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At this point, I began to wonder what the point of the parking tag was anyway! Room keys in hand, I approached the Jeep and found my husband parked further down the hill than I had left him. He informed me that the bellman had told him that he needed to move the car while he was waiting for me. The problem was that the hill was really steep and we were then going to have a problem removing our heavy bags on that downward slope. After driving around in a circle back to the original level spot, the bellman then offered to help unloading our bags into a golf cart. My husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backpack carried all of our electronics in it (laptop, nav unit etc..), and he let the bellman know that we would like to take that bag. The bellman then grabbed it anyway and tossed it in the back of the cart. Ugh. We proceeded to the cottage room and entered only to find a small, dark, damp, 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style studio apartment minus a kitchen and eating area with an atrocious bathroom and two full (not queen) size beds. We immediately announced to the bellman that it was our honeymoon. The bellman returned to the lobby to get a cottage with one large bed for us and returned in five minutes or so. While he was gone we observed the room a little better; it was not comfortable feeling (old, stinky damp). The air conditioning unit was struggling, the temperature inside was only slightly cooler than outside and it was very loud. The windows were old louver style windows that did not completely shut, hence why the temperature wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comfortable and why we could hear the girl next door talking on her cell phone so clearly. Additionally, the window did not offer any view of the beach, nor did the sliding glass door as it was facing the same boring lawn. I am unsure what anyone would find pleasing about staying there. We were escorted to the new cottage (same style and nasty feel) and within five minutes of discussion let the front desk know we needed a room in the hotel. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen pictures of cottages and were really impressed with the seclusion, updated style and the amazing views. This was not the case with the cottages at the Royal Lahaina. They offered us an ocean view room on the 11th floor of the hotel for an extra $100 per night and after reminding them again that it was our honeymoon, settled for the offer at $50 extra per night. We had already incurred $180 in unexpected charges and we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been there an hour. The bellman seemed annoyed that we asked for him to bring our jeep windows up with our bags (?), very strange. We proceeded to the hotel, completed the paperwork and proceeded to our room to await the arrival of our bags. The hotel room was much better. The bathroom was clean and so was the shower, the room was generally clean and put together. However, there were at least 4 large towels, two hand towels and only one washcloth. Who gives an odd number of matching towels? How frustrating to have to call for something so basic. It was definitely only a partial ocean view as it required you to be on the balcony and facing to the far right to see the ocean. The toilet was slow to flush and we thought that was just the way the toilet worked. Wrong. We found out later the first night that the toilet was actually clogged when we arrived when we had to call for maintenance after a flush that nearly caused on overflow. When the maintenance guy showed up he looked especially upset with the job that was ahead of him as if we had done something to make the toilet clog. Ugh. Our room key hardly ever worked and took at least 3-4 tries to read the key. We had to trade it in twice to have it reprogrammed, up and down from the 11th floor with all our stuff. We were sure to keep it away from cell phones and credit cards too. There was a safe that we called to verify we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay to use. As it turns out, in the tower the safe is free, but if you were in the cottage you would have to pay by credit card to use it (?). Gougers. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow housekeeping in our room at all, keeping the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign up for our entire stay. We are glad we did, we have since read several reviews indicating that folks had their bags torn apart while they were not in their rooms and some have reported personal items missing. Housekeeping called our room every day we had our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb sign up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and left a message with something like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is already 2:30 and we cannot clean your room because your sign is up. If you need towels call us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This was annoying because we obviously knew our sign was up. We put it there. The final day at 8:45 AM (check out is at noon) housekeeping stuck their card in the door to open it. I had just gotten out of the shower and freaked out, they verified that we were checking out today and said they would clean later. Give me a break; it was over three hours until we had to check out! The final night we were there we received a call at 12:15 AM (4:15 AM Colorado Time) from security waking us up to tell us to come down and move our Jeep as it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blocking traffic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We were not parked in a no parking zone, but were parked on the curb in their parking lot, just the same as several other vehicles parked there. There was plenty of room for cars to get by or we would have known better than to park there. My husband had to get dressed, go down with the keys, and was instructed by the front desk to go out and find another spot to park in. After getting the manager that had no idea what was going on, he told them that security told us to come down and move our car instead of at least offering to move it for us. That manager then offered to valet our vehicle free of charge and wave the nightly parking fee for our entire stay, (thank you for that one nice manager). The next morning I spoke with the Manager on Duty (MOD) and went over our entire experience with him. He was surprised that we had experienced such bad service by explaining that they get such great reviews but offered nothing to make up for it. Not even an hour later the same MOD approached my husband and I and asked us if we were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that couple that had to go to the hospital last night.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We were dumbfounded and replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and walked away. Hello?! We just talked to him about how terrible our experience was and apparently he cared so deeply that he already forgot? This interaction pretty much sums up the entire experience. At this point all we could do was laugh about what might happen next. Our final interaction was with the staff when checking out. The guy who assisted me with check out says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where are you going home to?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Denver,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not happy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty lame thing to say to someone who just paid a portion of your salary and is here on their HONEYMOON. That is how they ended our wonderful stay at the Royal Lahaina. The service is terrible and they do not care about you as a person. Spend the extra money and stay at the Sheraton.

The room was great, big lanai with a fantastic view of the ocean, the beach and the islands Moloka\u00ca\u00bbi and L\u00c4\ufffdna\u00ca\u00bbi. Room: When we first arrived, we were given a corner Ocean Front room on the fourth floor. When we got to the room, it was very nice, but located right above the Ocean Front Bar, and felt more like the 2nd floor than the 4th. We felt a bit disappointed and went down to the lobby to ask if any other rooms were available. The guy in the lobby was very nice and instead offered us an Ocean front room on the 10th floor. And when we walked in our new room, it was perfect. The view was wonderful and the room was quiet. The room was very nice, with a comfortable bed and a great balcony. The bathroom only had a sliding door and the sink is outside of the bathroom, which we felt was a bit weird. Since this was our honeymoon, we were given a bottle of champagne and flowers on the bed. Nice touch, even though we are not too fond of alcohol and did not drink it. (We hope the cleaning staff enjoyed it though!) Location: We did not have a car during our stay, we used an airport shuttle as well as tours to get around the island. Would have wanted a car if we had stayed longer though. The Royal Lahaina is about 5 minutes walk from Kaanapali Beach and Black Rock where most of the big Resorts in Lahaina are situated. This is NOT a downside. The beach right outside the hotel is beautiful, quiet and there is a lot of space. You can easily find your own little sunbathing spot. If you want to be close to restaurants during your \"day on the beach\" just take the beach walk or the free hotel shuttle bus and stay on Kaanapali Beach. Lahaina is a cute town (quite exploited though) close by. Take the shuttle bus (or walk 15min) to Whalers Village and then take the Maui bus (cost 1$) to Lahaina. Piece of cake. Try taking a 8 minute walk to CJ's Deli and Diner for breakfast/lunch or a \"Hana/Haleakala picnic basket\". Yummie! Black Rock is the BEST SNORKELING spot ever! We saw our first sea-turtle after 3 minutes in the water and then went on to spot pretty much the entire cast of \"Finding Nemo\", including three Spotted Eagle Rays, swimming in formation. Awesome! We rented really good snorkeling gear from the hotel (unlike what some other hotels offer, from what we heard), and walking to Black Rock and back is easy as pie. Luau: One night we went to the Royal Lahaina Luau, that was right next to the hotel. The food was so-so and the show was ok. However, the grand finale fire show made it all worth it. Spectacular! To wrap it up, the Royal Lahaina is great value for money. Everything 'extra' is pricey of course, such as internet, parking, breakfast, room service etc. But that seems to be true for most anything on Hawaii. The (tower) rooms are really nice, the view is great, but the location and the beach is the best of all. Probably the best in the Lahaina resort area. We LOVED Maui and our Balcony. We wish we could have stayed longer! Tip! Go up to Haleakala for the sunrise! WOW! Expedia has an office in the hotel and gives the best price for the tour. Ekani Tours - best ever.

The beach in front of the hotel is pleasant and the water is calm enough for swimming. Sunset views are beautiful. The resort has two smallish pools. They could use more lounge chairs. Ka'anapali is a bit far from many of the popular destinations on Maui. Lahaina is nearby but be prepared to drive an extra 20 minutes if you are heading to Hana, the Haleakala crater, or the marina for snorkeling/diving trips.

Most of the comments, negative and positive, I read prior to going were true. The hotel lobby just seemed like a traditional Hawaiian style lobby, may need some paint here or there, but really wasn't bad at all. The pineapple water they provide everyday in the lobby was great, especially after coming from a long walk, it was quite refreshing. 1 elevator wasn't running, but we never waited long. We were offered an upgrade from a partial ocean view room to an ocean view, I looked at the ocean view room before deciding and declined the upgrade. The ocean view room was on the exact same side of the building as the partial ocean view, just a higher floor but still a side view of the ocean, so why pay for that. The partial was perfectly fine for us. So, if you are offered the upgrade for a low price, my suggestion is to ask to see it before you pay. If I'm paying for an ocean view room I don't want to have to walk out on the patio to see the ocean, it should be apparent from the room. Now to the room. King size bed slept great, the room was clean when we arrived and there was a flat screen TV and a small fridge. The bathroom is small because it only includes the shower and toilet, the sink is on the outside of the bathroom, but separated from the room by wooden shutters, it was different, but not bad. My biggest problem at this hotel was housekeeping. They sucked!!!! When we arrived at the hotel, the bathroom had 3 bath towels and 1 washcloth, I thought that was strange. The another day they did the same thing, how do you have more bath towels and not an equal amount of wash cloths? Housekeeping took or threw away my travel can of Lysol air freshener, it was on the floor, but it was a full can, so if picked up you knew it wasn't trash. I complained about it and no one ever got back to me. Now, the reason this bothered me sooooooooo bad was, 1 day I took all the plastic cups (about 5) from having pineapple water and threw them on the floor with the dirty towels. When housekeeping cleaned the room, I swear, those same used plastic cups with leftover pineapple water drops, were stacked up on the dresser sitting in the tray with the glasses. NOw, how in the world, can you throw away a can of air freshener, and yet pick up some dirty cups stacked with dirty towels and place them to be used on a tray. Like I said, Housekeeping SUCKED!!! Oh, and the bed is never made as neat as the day you checked in, its like they don't care, they just straighten it up and that's it. Because the bed looked like a kid made it 1 day, I knew they didnt change the sheets, so we had to call and request fresh ones. The only meal we ate at the hotel was the breakfast buffet. For us, not worth the money, it was average and not very satisfying. We had a cheaper more fulfilling breakfast at the Gazebo in Napili, a must try, they have the best pineapple pancakes. When we ate breakfast at the hotel, my husband just picked up bagels for us from the store. The best part of the hotel is the location, the beach is great, not too crowded because it is north of black rock. On the south side of black rock is the westin and sheraton, so more crowded. We enjoyed being able to walk the beach without having tons of beach chairs in the way. You can walk about 15 mins from the hotel to Whaler's Village to go shop or get a quick bite to eat. There's also an Italian restaurant on the property it was good. Also, about a 5 min drive is the town of Lahaina where there's restaurants and shopping, you can park and walk for blocks. So, like I said the location of the hotel was great. We will not return here, because we like more options and better service, but if you are the type of people, who are only in a room to sleep, then it isn't a bad place to stay.

The chambermaid came into our room without knocking to bring in the clean robes and she didn't even apologised...that was very weird. The bellboy Ike was extremely weird as he took our bags up to our room and showed us where the switches are for each light and what the coffee maker was....come on!!! And then as we had no cash on us...he was staring at our hands for tips....so we had to tell him we will take care of his tip later once we get money withdrawn. By the way, all the staff is just \"hanging\" for tips, and they expecting it as it was a must, however the local staff are so rude especially at breakfast. They don't listen to you when they ask you if you want more coffee in your cup, I said no thanks, they still poured me some, or talking to us rudely. And they still bring out the bill for sign and \"tips\" after each breakfast however we had it included in our package....it was really annoying! I was not used to this at all! I mean, if there is a really good service, nice staff, great food etc, I don't mind giving them tips, but just because they are so underpayed and plus rude, don't expect 15-20% of tips every single time they serve us anything!!! And they never said hello or good bye or good night after breakfasts or dinners! How rude! The staff from the US they are nice, but the locals are really bad, made me feel very uncomfortable at this hotel. But as I mentioned the location of the hotel, the beautiful beach, the sunsets every night...that we were watching from our balcony or from the beach make up for any little inconvenience! The hotel has got two pools, one pool has a new bar called Tiki bar, it was great. The ocean is beautiful, warm water you can even snorkel around the Black rock. We were bitten by sealice when we went snorkelling to Monokini island, and I think I got bitten while swimming at Kaanapali beach as well. We went to the Royal Lahaina's Luau night just right next door the hotel, which was great! It was raining so hard but they gave us little ponchos so we didn't care, the dancers were absolutely great and the food was amazing, featuring the pork roast! Not sure if we would stay at the Royal Lahaina again, I think staying closer to the Wailer's village would be better in terms of more vibe and maybe a bigger hotel with much better service and nice staff!", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Nicer Beach\u201d", "Author": "BRIAN-IN-SD", "ReviewID": "UR41659250", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here last August (booked through Pleasant Holidays).

There is quite an age spread between all of them. Along with our family, we vacationed with my husband's sister and her family, and they have two kids as well. The oldest kid in the group is 12, youngest is 15 months (both being mine!). We knew when we booked the hotel that it was a decent value, and that we weren't going to be getting the amazing pools, but for the price we felt we were doing the right thing for our trip. We arrived very late (it was after midnight I believe), since we had taken a 6pm flight out of Los Angeles. The front desk was extremely courteous, even at that late hour. They got a service person (not a bellman - I think they had all gone home for the night!) to help us with our luggage, which I sincerely appreciated, and I tipped him well. Our room was in the tower, and it was gorgeous. It wasn't a huge room, and the next time we decide to go (and there will definitely be a next time!) we'll have to get two rooms since our two older kids are getting to the age where they definitely need their own space. That said, it was still fantastic. I loved having the balcony so that when the kids finally went to sleep at night, my husband and I could sit out there and enjoy the peace. I thoroughly appreciated having the refrigerator in the room as well, although for some reason it didn't seem to get very cold - even so, it really helped with keeping food on hand for the baby. After such a long flight, and long days every day, I can honestly say it was a joy to climb into bed - the sheets were soft, and the mattress was heavenly. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast one time and had the buffet. We thought it was fine, pricey for what they had, but honestly - that's the way it is when you are at a hotel, and that's why we didn't eat there more often. The service was fine though, and we would have eaten there again if our daily schedule had permitted it - we were just very busy and on the go every day! We also did the luau at this hotel. We had a great time! No, the food wasn't gourmet, but perhaps it's all about the expectations, because we knew we were going to a luau, not a fancy restaurant. We also knew we were going to get shell leis, and you know - we didn't really care. The only small issue I had was that we had to wait in a ridiculously long line, and mainly it was due to their photographers taking pictures, but even that, I can't complain too much because we bought the photo in the end. The kids also knew this, and we all expected the food to be FAR worse than it was...which it wasn't bad at all! I loved the kalua pig, and to be honest, I'm glad we didn't spend more to attend a different luau. It was perfect for what we wanted, and we all had a great time being there. Parking is kind of a pain in that no, you're probably not going to get a place near the door of the hotel unless you valet - but whatever. We're on vacation, and if we have to walk a bit, we have to walk. We always found a spot without a problem, and yes, the spots are tight. The pools were fine while we were there - my kids played in the pool two of the days, and I enjoyed that the area by the pool was grassy. It provided a nice place to escape from the sand of the beach (when you have a baby, sand is not a friend - so we split our time up and that was really nice). We really wanted to try out the activities that the hotel had to offer. (lei making, hula...etc....but we were never at the hotel long enough to try anything. Next time!) I absolutely ADORED the iced pineapple water that the hotel always had available inside the lobby. I filled up a cup every time I went in, and I also filled our water bottles with it when I had them available. Now that we're back home, I crave it so much that I'm going to go and buy my own glass jug to keep in the refrigerator with pineapple water in it - my kids loved it so much they drank more water than I've ever seen them drink that week. It was just a really nice touch. As for the elevators - I don't know what people are complaining about. No, there isn't a bank of 10 elevators available. Big deal. We were there for a week, and we never, EVER waited longer than 2 or 3 minutes for the elevator - and there were only 3 working while we were there as well. I think people are being a little bit ridiculous about this complaint, to be honest. Our room faced the garden, but we also had a partial oceanview. In looking at my paperwork when we flew home, I noticed I had reserved a full oceanview room - honestly it's the only real complaint I have about the hotel, and obviously it didn't bother me that much otherwise I would have noticed it sooner and said something. The next time we go, I'm going to request an oceanfront room - my sister-in-law's family had one, and it was fabulous. We loved our trip, and we loved how quaint and Hawaiian this hotel was. It was beautiful, and well-worth every penny.

No deadbolt, no electronic lock. In room safe, but they change $3.75 per day for its use. Outrageous for a room costing over $200 per night! Wireless internet is a joke -- it is pay as you go, but the signal is too low and unreliable to be useful (I am a computer pro and know what I'm doing). The setting is extremely nice, as you would expect in Lahaina area, and maybe the newer tower is OK, but the cottages are just not worth $200 per night. Oh, and there is no complimentary breakfast either. The breakfast buffet was substandard. Average menu, most food lukewarm or worse, cost $20 per person. For other meals, menu service is expensive for the quality and the wait service is VERY slow. If you have a car and don't want to use the valet parking then you are charged $10 per day, but you share the lot with their evening Luau which means you probably can't park between 6PM and 9:30PM if you aren't already parked. Valet costs more, of course, but then it is their problem to find a spot - the best spots reserved for the valets, naturally. Overall, the resort is very overpriced for the quality.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave you with just the few nitpicky things that in no way lowered our overall enjoyment: elevators slow(currently being replaced), nowhere to hang wet bathing suits, no free wireless internet(1st time, 1st hour is free), and the fridge is in a cupboard and does not stay cold unless you leave the door open. If you happen to be stuck in the room some of the channels have no signal and the feeds are all east coast so after midafternoon everything is infomercials. These are all minor things and if we ever go back to Maui we WILL stay at the Royal Lahaina again!

The hotel was nice, they cleaned it everyday, inside and out. It was our honeymoon so they upgraded us to an oceanfront, but we took the partial and was totally fine with the view. We did'nt stay in our room much at all, why would you?? (ROOM) But lets say you get tired from all the activities. Theres a flat screen, probably 32 inches with HD. Keep bottled water in your room, the tap is a little salty. The lighting in the bathroom was to dim for my wife, so I took a bedside table lamp and put it in there. Toilet and shower are in same room. Sink is behind wall in bedroom. There is a safe and fridge. Downstairs is a resturant, lil pricey, foods ok. Two pools, really great beach. Want to snorkel or anything, hotel rents that stuff. Snorkel set $15, down the street its $1.50. We went snorkeling right outside the hotel, so I paid the higher price. Just walk outside to the beach, look left and see the big black rock. Its like the movie Finding Nemo. Sea turtles and thousands of fish, a five to ten minute walk away. The beach is clean, nothing but great sand and waves that crash right into eachother on the shore. Get about ten feet out and its smooth swimming. (CAR) Location is great, but we rented a car. If we did'nt have that, we would be stuck near a bunch of resorts on one of the most gorgouse beaches. The car allowed us to go three miles or so to Front Street in Lahaina. I went with Budget, four days was $160. Gas is 3.48 a gallon, fill it up before you return it. Budget will charge $5 a gallon and for the whole tank, no matter if its half full or not! (FOOD) If you are an early riser like me and want some breakfast, dont go to Starbucks or McDonalds. I drove around for two hours, trying to find eggs and bacon. Where do the locals eat?? I had to settle for a coffee shop breakfast, bagel and coffee... But if you go to Front Street in Lahaina, the street near the ocean. If your coming from the hotel, stay to your right, exit at Canoes resturant, onto Front St. There is shops, then a neighborhood, then all the other shops. Look for the ice cream shop on your right, pull in and a little nook called the Sunrise Cafe is there. For under six dollars you can get the best eggs benedict, potatoes and fruit. I had coffee, her juice, $20. The hotel breakfast buffett is $20 per person alone and I don't stuff myself early with a buffett. Lunch, backup down the street to the Mixed Plate, sit next to the ocean and eat great food for the same price. Dinner is up to you, we tried several places, non that really rocked my world. She liked Cheeseburger in Paradise and no its not a Jimmy Buffet place. (ACTIVITIES) Hit the shops on Front st. buy some Hawaii stuff, museums, the weirdest tree, Banyon tree is on that street. Kids will love that tree, like a piece of playground equipment. We took surfing lessons, hurt my foot and limped around for awhile. Paid $100, it was...starts with an O, Olehu...look it up. Good guys, Hoto was our instructor...\"1, 2, 3 Baseball\" Old japanese gym teacher, very nice and good instructor. We surfed. Did the hotel Luau. She really had a good time. The open bar means, cheap mixed Mai Tais and Budweiser. But the hula girls and their hips were worth it to me and there are hula guys for her. I think it was 130 total for the good seats. All you can eat and drink, lasts about two hours. if your on the way back to the airport, and are early...kill time at the aquarium in Malaeah bay, spellings off. 23 per person, its worth it if you have never been to one. So to sum it up, it was a blast. We are going to take the kid next year. DONT FLY DELTA, so much bs. Coming from KC or east, United flys to Denver then to Maui. Delta, Minn, Wa, Maui.

More importantly was the service we received at this resort. It was nothing short of first class. The resort offers many activities from early morning yoga to lei making classes throughout the course of the day. The valet service is top notch. Every time we need our car we were never kept waiting. Upon returning to the resort after a day of touring or exploring you were always greeted by a man or women at the gate welcoming you \"home.\" Once you pulled up to the valet or self parked and walked into the lobby you would be greeted with ice cold pineapple water and cool face cloths to refresh yourself. There are other reviews that make mention to the problems with the elevators in the reosrt but I can honestly say we did not have the same experience even with one of the three elevators down for maintanance. Another plus about this resort is the fact that they have a Pleasure Adventures and Expedia kiosk right in the resort. Both are great for securing reservations for such things as tours, to luas, to dinner reservations for restaurants around the Island. The Terrace room restaurant is great for breakfast and dinner. The Price is right and the food is excellent. The view from the Terrace restaurant is breathtaking, especially around sunset when the nightly torch lighting ceremony takes place. We stayed on the 11th floor of the Tower. The room was fantastic. We had two lanais: One off our bedroom and one off the sitting area/living area. Both faced the ocean and the views were just spectacular! The decor was modern with an island feel that kept it true to its roots. The room was so nice it was hard to leave it. With that being said, you are not in Hawaii especially Maui for the room. The reort sits on arguably the best stretch of beach in Maui. It is also adjacent to a golf coursethat stretches all the way to black rock so in a sense it is basically a private beach. Black rock separates this stretch of beach from the other stretch of the beach that is much more crowded due to the number of hotels on that particular stretch. If you are into snorkeling, Black Rock is great and you do not need to head out on a tour. The coral reefs is beautiful with lots of fish and coral life. There were also plenty of sea turtles that would be swimming around this part of the beach. I have nothing negative to say about this resort. Of course if you are into those resorts that have a great pool scene wher there are bridges and hottubs then this is not the reort for you. The resort does have two pools but are just simple pools with a tiki bar where you can get drinks. These pools are more than adequate and in my opinion you are there for the beach anyway. The staff at the Royal Lahaina were great in every way and would go above and beyond in any way they could to make your stay a pleasurable and memorable one. I do not hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone. I can't wait to go back!! One more thing. There are cottages located on the premises that you can stay in. I agree with some of the other reviewers that they are not in the best of shape. However, they are not nearly as bad as some have suggested. We actually became friendly with a couple that was staying in one of the cottages and found the cottages to be quite intimateand nice. The cottages are going to be torn down and villas are being built in there stead. So thisattributes to the fact that more is not being down to perfect those cottages.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Great Service\u201d", "Author": "Bixbyjeans", "ReviewID": "UR34639244", "Content": "1.

When we arrived, the lobby was impressive and grand, but then the front desk area was completely outdated with peeling Hawaiian wall paper and worn out carpeting. Our impression of our room was very different, however. We had an ocean-view room in the newly renovated tower. It was BEAUTIFUL! We absolutely loved the calming, pale blue color on the walls with the contrasting dark wood furniture. The room had a contemporary feel with granite countertops, neutral carpeting and ceramic tile and a large flat-screen LCD TV. Everything in our room was luxurious. But then we were catapulted in to the 1970's again when we went to the Terrace restaurant. The cushions on the dining furniture were falling apart and there was bird poop on many of the chairs. The decor was very outdated. The food was delicious, though, and very inexpensive for the island. We ventured on the pools. The first pool was definitely newer and really nice with cobalt blue tile. The second pool was in serious need of repair, however. There were many missing tiles and it needed a good cleaning. There is a serious shortage of lounge chairs around the pools. We noticed that hotel guests would claim their chairs early in the morning by putting a towel on them. It was quite amusing and annoying at the same time. Why wouldn't a beach resort have more lounge chairs?? The tiki bar near the second pool also appeared to need some major work. The beach was great! We love swimming in the ocean, so we opted for not staking out a lounge chair and just went straight to the beach. The current and undertoe were strong, but the waves were great and it was absolutely beautiful. I prefer the Kaanapali beaches over the Wailea beaches. We loved the tennis ranch at the Royal Lahaina. There were at least 9 courts that I counted and it was very easy to schedule court time. The courts were in great condition and I felt like I was back at a high-end resort. My husband asked where the fitness facility was and he was told they didn't have one. I found that very disappointing that this \"resort\" had a tennis ranch, but no fitness facility. Overall, the condition of this resort is very inconsisent and lacks that \"aloha spirit\" we were really seeking.

What I loved about the place is the balcony + the big fridge. that means you can stuck up in a closeby safeway and premake sandwitches for you trips, and keep them cold! + if you want you can even get a bottle of wine, cool it down and drink it on the balcony while watching a Maui sunset. priceless! - hotel amenities - pretty week. the pool was pretty much non existent for me. but on the other hand I was comming straight out of Vegas where I was hanging out by the greates pool in town. so anyway. its there, its small - but no fun. the beach is great though! restaurant is ok. unfortunately there is not much going on... - hotel park: nice, condos, lots of flowers but nothing special. just average I think, but really nice. - location: SPECTACULAR. if you dont mind the walk - Kanaapali is right there. whalers village is right there, 3 minute drive to safeway and lahaina. 2 great snorkling places in walking distance. just spectacular! it is priceless to walk out of the hotel, straight to the beach and right there - you are swimming with sea turtles... - other: the elevators. they are really old and prettyy much scary. during the 5 days of my vacation there I think I have spent at least an hour on vaiting for the elevator. but thats a minor flaw Overall I would recommend royal lahaina to anybody. I would certainly go back. Yes - if you dont mind the money you can spend a couple hundred more and stay at the sheraton which is hard to beat (amenities, views etc.) but on the other hand - why not save the couple hundreds and use them for shopping or a couple of nice nights out in a good restaurant? anyway - if you have answers - will be glad to answer.

We stayed in the tower with a partial ocean view. The photographs on their website are accurate and do reflect how the rooms look like. Our room included a king size bed with a down mattress pad on top of the normal mattress and a light down comforter and down pillows. The room also included a shower (no tub), mini frig, in-room safe, blow dryer, iron, daily coffee and tea replenished and daily hawaiian local paper. The soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were a lovely coconut-lime scent which I made sure to take home with me. The room had plush towels and included spa robes. For the most part, my husband and I were out and about seeing Maui but the time we did spend at our hotel included a nice size pool with free beach towel service when you tell them your room number. They had some vendors in the lobby in the morning selling hawaiian goods. There is a kiosk in the building where you can set up your tours, activities if you so choose. The hotel also offers a luaa although we opted to do the Old Lahaina because our friends recommended it. When we first checked in our king wasn't available and we were in a double bed room on the third floor. We packed our stuff ready the next morning and the hotel staff moved our stuff for us while we were out sight-seeing to a king bed the following day. One day the hotel staff must have gotten interrupted while cleaning our room as we had a shammy left on the counter and our bath supplies were not replenished but the hotel staff downstairs accommodated us very easily. It has probably the best location for the beach at Kaanapali as you can easily walk to Black Rock to snorkel from the beach and the snorkeling is excellent at Black Rock with turtles and schools of fish. It is cheaper than actually staying at the Sheraton at Black Rock and still easily accessible. Cons: We did not use the internet during our trip but the rooms are not wireless unless you subscribe to a service that the hotel does not run so if you have problems you have to call the company direct. Also the hotel does offer ethernet but the bellhop was not very knowledgeable as to the details. Apparently there are lots of activities but there is no way of knowing the hotel activity schedule because it is not included in any documentation in the room or on a board in the lobby. I think the hotel should look into posting it...it is on their website but if you don't have internet access on your trip it's a moot point. We were out and about and didn't want to bother with paying for the internet and didn't do that many activities at the hotel so in the end it wasn't a big deal. You can rent snorkel stuff but it's cheaper to rent in Lahaina as the hotel charges much more. We didn't try any of the restaurants or shops at the resort. Initially when you check in the reception desk person hands your hotel keys to the bellhop thus forcing you to allow the bellhop to take your bags as you can't get a hold of your hotel keys without using him. Your then obligated to tip him for taking your bags from the lobby 15 feet to the elevator and then to your room. That was a bit annoying as I had little luggage that I couldn't handle myself. I chalked it up to assisting tourism during the recession.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cSo happy we booked here!!\u201d", "Author": "travelgrl00", "ReviewID": "UR32208622", "Content": "pardon my spelling, in a bit of a hurry! My husband and I booked through expedia.com and booked a terrace view since it was significantly cheaper. But when we arrived we upgraded for 25$/night for a partial ocean view and are glad we did, what a view!! Check in was a breeze, and check out was even breezyer! We payed the 16$/day for parking and the 2 mai tais a day deal. You could get your mai tais at either the bar in the restaruant or the poolside bar but had to get them before 9pm, so remember that if you are leaving and won't come back till late. also, parking spots are tight! and everytime i opened my door, i hit the other car accidently, so might want to get renters insurance.... We stayed on the 7th floor and had a lovely view of Molokai, the ocean and the west maui hills. The lanai was nice with 2 chairs and table, perfect for morning coffee, or letting your swimsuits dry off. The rooms are upgraded, flat screen TV, comfy bed, only downfall is the lighting in the vanity, but there is another mirror in the hall with more lighting. oh, and you could hear into the hall easliy, which means people can hear you while your in your room... Shower was nice and so were the soaps and shampoos (cococut scented!) the lobby is kind of old school, with murals and rock walls, but i though that was cool. and the pinapple water in the lobby is very refreshing! good to refill your waterbottle with! Staff friendly, bartenders pretty friendly too. We ate at the restaurant a few times, and i really enjoyed it. It is open to the outdoors and has a lovely view of the beach, ocean and pool area. Food was ok, nothing spectacular. we had nachos(huge!), fish tacos-sm. portion, and the garlic fries were great. The breakfast buffet is 20$, and quite a variety of things to choose from. The bisquits were cold and hard, but then they put out new ones that were fresha and d-lish. We ended up going to whalers village, or out to sushi for our other meals. We rented a car, which is a must if you want to explore. there is a shuttle to take you to the whalers village (shopping, restaurants), and from there you can take teh maui bus, every hour for a dollar to get to the cannery mall in lahiana. The hula grill-bar in whalers village is excellent for dinner, and live music playing and your feet are in the sand, looking out to the sunset.. but make reservations and be prepared to wait 45 minutes (you could 0just shop around though). We mostly walked to the whalers village on the nice path they have (about 15 minute walk). the beach is great, not too crowded on the end near black rock, and the snorkeling at black rock is awesome! We saw 2 sea turtles one day, but the other days, the current was too strong to snorkel there. Snorkeling is also good on the other end of the hotel (about a 5 minute walk to the right) lots of coral and pretty fish! Overall, great place to stay for the price, and we will definately stay here again!

My impressions of the place are both good and bad. We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff and were upgraded to a better accomodation than we had paid for (cottage with ocean view instead of garden view) free of charge because it was our honeymoon, which was nice. However, if you go, do not, I repeat do NOT, stay in one of the cottages! The ocean view was lovely but the cottage was a damp, smelly and not very clean place. After the first night I wanted to pay for a hotel room instead (haven't actually been in one but from pictures and from what I heard from other guests, the rooms seem lovely) but since this was the last week of our trip and we didn't have that much money left, we decided to \"tough it out\"... As mentioned before, we were well met by all staff with a few exceptions (such as the hula teacher not-too-interested in having classes...) For excursions I would recommend turning to Expedia instead of Pleasant Holidays (both have offices at the resort); nicer, cheaper AND with better tickets! And I'm afraid I can't recommend the wedding/vow renewal planning service either. Other than that, everyone treated us well. All in all, we had a good stay, partly because we didn't spend much time in our cottage. Location is very good, with the snorkeling spot Black Rock within walking distance and a free trolley passing by other hotels and restaurants on Ka'anapali Beach.

I am writing this after just returning today from the island. It has truly been the longest travel day/night of my life. Being that this was a trip to Hawaii, I have to start out by saying Aloha and what a wonderful experience. Since this is only a review of the hotel, I will leave out the details of our 7 day tour and focus on the highlights of the hotel. After experiencing Maui first hand, I highly recommend it to any couple who would like to just truly get away from the hustle and bustle of the mainland USA. Now, for the resort. For those that just want a quick yes or no (to book or not to book) my gut instinct is a yes. (for married folks, couples, singles, and the romantically involved.) If you are a surfer, hiker, or you are adventure/nightlife seeking, there are probably better options. Skip down to the end if you just want the quick summary. This hotel is situated up the west coast of the island of Maui. It is just about as secluded as you can get for the price. The drive is roughly 30-40 minutes from the Kahului airport in central Maui. If you are coming in during the day and this is your first time, take a moment as you drive to truly take in the drive on Hwy 30 heading toward Lahaina. If the sun is shining bright, it is truly a treat for those that appreciate nature and the elements. After you pass through Lahaina, look for Kaanapali Parkway and make a left. Take the winding road (Keeka, I think) up to the Royal Lahaina Resort (another fantastic view of the water, greens and beach). After you pass the guard shack (more on that later) go all the way through the stop sign and come back around up to the main entrance. (I made the mistake of driving up the wrong way....great laugh.) The valets are ready and waiting to check you in and get you on your way. At this point, your hotel experience begins; If you would like to have the valet take your car, it is $15 daily. (first of few negatives for me) Some may say that's cheap (compared to Chicago/New York..etc.) so if you are up for it, I recommend doing so. Although we did not take advantage of this, it will truly come in handy later. We found out the parking lot is small and does not accommodate anything larger than a Chevy Areo without being on top of the next car...and even that's a stretch. By the grace of God we didn't get a scratch on our rental...So let this be my first official negative about the resort. *Beware of the parking lot* The spaces are very small and if you self-park, you do so at your own risk. Additionally, because they have their own luau on sight, parking is extremely difficult between 5pm and 8:30pm. So my advice is to pay the $15 and let the valet handle it; from what I saw, they were very timely and it seemed hassle free. To self park is $10. Check-in was flawless. In fact, call ahead to confirm your reservation and ask for a room upgrade to save a few $$$ when you book. Our package deal was flight/hotel for $1598 6 days and 5 nights. This included a terrace view. If you are vacationing in Maui, then you have to go the extra mile and get the ocean view...I cannot tell you how relaxing it was to have the patio door open listening to the ocean all night long. Upgrading the room cost us an additional $50 per night compared to $235 on the booking site. They told me for that week, the normal price for the room we got was $400. Okay; to address the complaints about the elevator. It is totally true what folks have been saying; although, I have to be a bit more grown up about it. True, the elevator is outdated and slow as molasses; and yes, that can be frustrating for those up on floors 6 and above. My advice would be, simple ask them to change your room to a lower floor and don't take the elevators. My wife and I heard a couple complaining they had waited 10 minutes for it and were all pissed off. My thought is, after 2 or 3 minutes, look for the stairs. And that's exactly what we did. Unless were carrying something heavy or needed to go through the main lobby, we took the stairs. Inconvenient? Of course; but there are worse things than slow elevators. So I will let this be my second negative because it is true. *Avoid the elevators, the are slow at times* Our room was on the 5th floor and the view was just spectacular. I couldn't ask for anything more. (as you can see from the pics). The room itself was simple; the decor was nice and the bed was very comfortable. But it was truly all about the view. Another plus was being on the west side of the building, we got to see every sunset. If you are looking for that romantic setting, this is truly it. The Royal Ocean Terrace is the hotel's in-house restaurant. I have a mixed review about it. Breakfast was not the greatest. Good concept, overpriced, and not the greatest quality. We did the buffet our first morning (I think it was $20 or $30 per person...I can't remember.) There was a good spread, but most of the food was cold. I cannot stand cold food, so this is a little personal for me. I asked the waiter to warm it up, and he did; however, that doesn't fare well when you have to do that multiple times during a meal. Plus, the plates were cold, which probably contributed to the food issue. My wife didn't like the buffet at all, so I can't really give good marks for breakfast. Also, my third negative. *Beware of the birds*. I have never seen birds that are so bold....and not just the big ones...small ones too...(see pic) I'm not one to want to contend with fowl when I'm eating. It was cute the first time; but annoying after awhile. Dinner at the Terrace was better for me; the menu was deep for a hotel...and the prices were reasonable for the portions..($15-$30 per plate) My wife again wasn't too impressed; but a lot of this had to do with her just not feeling well either..so it wouldn't be fair to totally include her misfortune. The highlight was the dinner music. Each night, they have a local musician play soft dinner music (a few covers mixed with some Hawaiian music). I thought it added a nice touch with the ocean backdrop. A plus for us was that after we ate, we could go upstairs and still hear him perform. It was great! To wrap up, the hotel staff was VERY friendly. And I truly mean this....I did not see one person that mistreated us or gave us an unfriendly response. It was always, yes sir/ma'am...right away...or what can we do for you? I was totally blown away. We don't see that too much back here in the Midwest. The shops in front of the resort were also very convenient...a nice way to kill an hour if you just want to get out a bit. Also, they have two activity centers (for tours and adventure stuff). One is inside the hotel, and one is just to the right before you walk in. I recommend price matching before you make a commitment. We got sucked into one and could've saved about $75 on a show. We also added 2 additional days and an extended checkout. Ask about their policy before you commit. They will allow extended until 1pm; however, they have an extension for an additional $100 for whatever time you wish..(convenient for us because our flight left at 9pm) Personally, I would ask if they could hold your bags for a few hours because $100 is kinda steep for a few hours; but I felt it was worth it not to have to worry about running around too much before leaving. Summary: Pros: Not as expensive as other resorts in the area Secluded Friendly staff Romantic Food on premises Beach is about 75 yards away No real crowds to speak of..even on Memorial Day weekend Housekeeping was Great! Cons: Parking Slow Elevator Birds in the restaurant Breakfast was not very great 20 minutes from the great restaurants As I stated earlier; the guard shack experience was one of the most humbling moments I've had in my life. There is a man that works their (usually nights) named Tupou (sp). He greeted us our first day and our last. It started with a simple line: \"Welcome, this is your home.\" Not very moving to the average person; but when I saw him day after day, I was convinced he was truly sincere. He greeted everyone with a smile both coming and going. It was so moving to see such spirit in a human being these days. My wife and I could not wait to get back to the resort from our daily activities just to be greeted by him. We were very sad when we left and wanted so badly to take him with us. How great would it be to have someone truly welcome you home each and everyday no matter what the circumstance? He was truly a blessing to us; and if he or the staff have an opportunity to read this, I would like to personally say, mahalo for your service and a hui hou...you are truly ohana to us.

After a 14 hour flight from Atlanta, the last thing you want is a rude front desk person and especially one that takes forever to hand over the keys.

Bathrooms- Beautiful stone tile, and let me say- the coconut lime soaps smell very tropical and delicious. I wish I could buy a huge bottle of the body wash! Grounds/ Parking- The flowers are great on the grounds, kept so clean and the golf course is beautiful. The parking is a little tight, so be sure to get a compact car, but also be sure to get the package which includes parking and the Mai Tais, Parking is $10 per day, and the Mai Tai's on their menu are $9, but for $15 a day you get 2 free Mai Tai's, access to the safe in your room, and parking- it's worth it! And they do not get cheap on the alchohol in those drinks, lemme tell you! The pool to some may seem dated, but there's two and I thought they were both great- and besides, the beach at the RL is so nice you won't want to be in the pool but to lay in the sun. Restaurants- Basil Tomatoes is \"okay\" it reminded me of Olive Garden, which if you like Olive Garden, you will love Basil Tomatoes. We went for lunch on the fly and I had the pesto ravioli's (which were actually very good) and my husband had the burger. The burger was hugeeee, My husband the human garbage disposal couldn't finish it. The burger is $7 (great deal) but to have topay $2+ for fries. Ocean Terrace Rest. was our favorite. Great food. We've had the nachos, ribs, Kalua pork quesadillas, and we were never disappointed! AND, they give you LOTS of food! the nachos are worth $14. AND, they had nightly entertainment while you ate. (the restaurant is also infront of the pool and ocean so there's never a bad view and great sunsets) Over all, our stay at RL was wonderful. The staff was great, the cleaning crew were great (There were always 2 maids per room), the front desk was great to suggest restaurants to us, and over all really helpful. And know that when I left, the new elevators were already installed and someone was working on them. I will definetly come back to the Royal Lahaina when visiting Maui again, I just hope they don't wise up to what a great value they offer and charge more for the excellent service and rooms.

Six of us travelled altogether, three couples, all in our 20's. There were some other younger couples on this resort, but mostly people come in families with children, or for weddings as well as anniversaries. We saw other beaches during our trip, but I must say, our resort was on a beautiful clean beach, the best beach we saw. The location was excellent, not a far drive to front street and local dine-ins and parking was about $10/day. There are also small shops directly outside the hotel. The staff were exceptional during our stay, so polite, friendly, happy. They were open to upgrading the room from a terrace view to a partial ocean view for us, what a nice way to start our vacation. The rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable. They are just as they look in the pics. I was surpised to read the handful of bad reviews. This resort is quiet, comfortable and affordable. It's no 5-star, but it's a great 4-star. My advice: Stay in the tower, not in the cottages. The rooms are not renovated there, we heard from others, and saw for ourselves. Ew. The beds are the best part, oh so comfortable. The resort is quiet by 10, most people are asleep.. so take a nice walk around the resort, the bar, the pool, the beach and enjoy the quiet enviroment. Make sure you go to the Luau that is offered right on the resort! It was a great experience. And order the pina colada in a pineapple from the bar on the resort :) Hope this helps.

I adored the lovely Hawaiian kitsch feeling of the lobby, and the pineapple water really made my vacation! The pool isn't as astounding as the others on the resort stretch, but get a little creative and just go there anyway for some drinks and swimming. There's a great and easy path in between all the Kaanapali resorts (it gets a little hedgy through the parking lot at the Sheraton, but it's there!). If I were to go to Kaanapali again, I'd stay at the Royal Lahaina for sure. (It's also really easy to get into Lahaina on the Maui Transit Bus.)

We stayed for 6days 5nights at the Royal Lahaina Resort. I had my doubts with this place before booking, but that went away when we got there. i'll break up my review for those of you who want to skip to what you want to read: Parking: The parking cost $10 a day for self park or $15 for valet. I can understand Oahu/Waikiki area charging for parking because real estate is scarce, but on Maui? The Parking stalls are small...If you do get a rental just buy the bumper to bumper coverage..you will get dents if you park at this hotel..that's a guarantee. Also there is a nightly luau so you have to ether get in early before 5pm or get there right after they leave 915pm. Check in: Check in was painless and they upgraded my room to a Partial ocean view or a ocean front cottage. i opted for the upgraded partial ocean view because i wanted to see the Newly renovated rooms. The staff at the front desk were helpful and not rude at all ( i remember seeing a posting that the staff was rude...maybe those people got fired) Room: we stayed on the 3rd floor which was not bad but i wish i had a few more floors up. The rooms were great! they were standard size but they really spent some money on the renovation. i must say the bed was super super soft...I really miss that bed. All the wood in the room is some type of dark wood( sorry i dont know what type of wood) that smelled great. all the bath room fixtures were from kholer. all the metal fixtures were bamboo design. The Interior design of the room was very pleasant with framed pictures of waves and Hawaiians in canoes. There was a paddle mounted to the recessed wall as you enter the room. the TV was a Flat screen LCD (32') which sat on the Office desk / Dresser. The lanai was some what small..only good for 2 people at a time. There are no blinds, but there were these wooden dividers which tied into the Wood theme of the room. 1 thing i did not like was the lack of Closet/ dresser space and the small...really small fridge. THEY CHARGE FOR INTERNET ACCESS! you get 60 min's free every 48 hours. so after you use up your 60 min's it's $9.95 . All in all its a good room for 2 people..more than that and that would be pushing it. Restaurant: We had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs on our last day there and we should have spent more time at the restaurant...but where's the fun in that. The food was really good. My wife had the Mac nut pancakes and i had the buffet. All the food was great, the spread had a lot of variety and all the food was fresh. Of course all the fruits were sweet and delicious. The staff at the restaurant was very attentive and you didnt have to go looking for help because there was someone always close by waiting. Watch out if you eat outside...these birds are not afraid to eat off your plate WHILE YOUR STILL EATING! it was cool to watch though. Hotel Grounds: The hotel is Located off hwy 30 at Kekaa Dr. If you play golf then you picked the right hotel. There is a golf course adjacent to the property which is convenient. there are also 9 full size tennis courts . There are two pool, but who would use the pool when the pacific ocean is located 5 feet from the pool!?! The beach is calm and often empty. No problem finding a spot to tan or just fall asleep..that's what i did. There are some independently owned shops on the property which are not worth mentioning. The Hotel lobby is furnished with a Hawaiian/ Canoe theme which was pleasant to the eyes...since i'm the subject of pleasant , there is a Pleasant Holiday information desk in the lobby....there is also a competing Expedia information office right outside the front lobby. Luau: I read the Reviews and the Luau go some bad reviews. I personally have been to too many Luau's , I've been to Luau's on the big Island which looked like they were put on by a Circ de sole to i can't even count how many on Oahu. The luau at the Royal Lahaina was pretty good. They had the all the plots to the luau..the unearthing of the Pig from the emu, the luau demonstration , the Joke telling...which was pretty good... the food and the show. i actually liked this Luau. It got to the Point...The show was great! the music was good, the Food was Actually good, the mistress of ceremonies was the Best! and the Performers were not bad to looks at...not at all. It was an open bar ...nuff said and if you order a specialty drink it's $15 free refills....just buy one and share it with your friends...thats what the girl next to me did. Hey it's free! Good Luau if your staying at this hotel...you dont have to find parking and you can just stumble back to your room! Staff: The entire staff at the Royal Lahaina Resort was fantastic! I do want to give a shot out to the guy working the shack when you first drive in...made you feel like you live there...as you drive out he would make sure he gave you a Aloha and a Shaka as you drove by and as you drove back in he Greeted you with \" ALOHA and welcome home\" ....very nice touch...i know how boring working the guard shack must be on the swing/night shift and dealing with tourist everyday and to have that smile and pleasant and welcoming attitude is just ...well the ALOHA spirit. i would definitely recommend this hotel in the future.

A balcony view of the garden in the main tower amazing (Garden view room). The water is clear on the beach line. Two well sized pools not crowded in May,we swam with the baby it was great.

Hostess hilarious. The Four Winds II ($78/each) for snorkeling with a one year old amazing lunch (chicken breast delicious) good breakfast staff amazing, FREE fishing, glass bottom boat area for kids/adults, fun water slide into the ocean, you view turtle town in the middle of the ocean and see sea turtles swimming. Maui Escape helicopter tour awesome, great staff, good price ($220/each) same helicopter that filmed Jurasic Park. Experienced pilot. Maui princess for dinner cruise awful. We were polluted by diesel fuel while we were eating, it's old no high chairs for babies. Road to Hana wonderful an ALL day trip. FREE just pay the gas on your rental and you are good. You see and can swim in hidden waterfalls (please bring watershoes, slippery rocks), the famous black beach, 7 pools, explore caves, etc. WARNING the road is windy during the 2 hour drive to Hana those that suffer from severe nausea ( Scobalamine patches goes behing your ears MD must prescribe or Dramaine over the counter; These drugs good for cruise/boat rides too).

On Front street in Old Lahaina you will find great reasonable breakfast prices at Sunset Cafe (looks dingy at first but food great 5.99 complete breakfast meal) and another restaurant $6-8 great food sorry forgot the name looks like a sailboat curtains.

Kind of a drag to pay $40 a day to utilize chairs on the beach, but they are covered and it's the going rate at other hotels too. We went to safeway, bought a cooler & our own beer and wella! Saved tons of money. They were cool about our own cooler and never said a word., We did ask if it was ok before we bought it and they said yes. Good snorkeling right next door at black rock. Make the long trip to Mammas fish house, expensive but what a view! There is a bus by Whalers village that will take you into Lahaina for $1. Worth it if you want to avoid driving.

We had a wonderful time at this resort. I have traveled a bit for my vacations, I've even been to Maui before, but I have to say, there is no place like Maui.... It's God's gift to us, people on this earth.... About Royal Lahaina... I was a bit confused when one day I would read positive review, the next day, negative review... I did not know what to make out of it, that is why I wanted to take a few minutes and write about my experience at Royal Lahaina Resort. I traveled with my sister and my 18 y/o and 10 y/o nieces, we arrived late at night about 1030pm on Monday night, the minute we pulled the car in front of the resort, this young man came to open the door for us and lead me to the front desk, while I was checking in with the most friendly lady there, my car was being unloaded and the lugage was being taken care of, I upgraded to an ocean front room, I figured I don't come to Maui everyday, therefore I want the best there is for me and my nieces. I was on the 4th floor, right in the middle with full ocean view, breath taking.... the bell boy brought my stuff upstairs and I had asked him for a vending machine to get some cold water, instead he showed up a few minutes later with 4 botles of water, complimentary from the hotel staff, since everything else was closed, I guess... That little gesture meant so much to me, when I was so tired, travelling since 6 am and being on 2 planes for more than 9 hours and also loosing one plane, than having to drive from the airport to the hotel in the dark on a rainy night.... I was exhosted, all I wanted was cold water to drink, a good shower and a bed... I got them all... the shower had so much water pressure, was just great, the room was outstanding, the decor, the cleanliness, and NO SMELL !!!! The bed sheets, were white as snow and so crisp, than the bed....oh my Lord... the best matresses ever..I spend $3,000.00 on my mattresses at home and they are not as good as the ones from Royal Lahaina Resort.... I, actually all 4 of us slept like babies that night and all nights :) In the morning we got to actually see where we were at, WOW, the view, the landscaping, all kinds of flowers and plants... so well maintained and manicured, the beach.... my it was beautiful, just gorgeous... and to top all that, the staff was unbelievable, they were so friendly and always with a smile on their face at anytime of the day... There were some classes on Hula Dancing, LEI making, and Puka shell necklace making, which my 10 y/o old had to attend them all, she had such a great time... she got to bring home the Lei and of course her Puka necklace and she constantly does the Hula for us... The people teaching the classes made us feel so special by being so friendly and telling us places to go eat with the locals and places to visit.... They were the best !!!!!!!! I don't know what to say but that I miss Maui and the people from the resort, on the day we left the staff stopped us to say good bye and to ask us to return soon, which of course I will, I would not want to dissapoint my new friends....

The grounds are beautifully kept, and the location is excellent. Infamous \"Black Rock\" is a 2 minute walk down the beach. On the other side of Black Rock hotel prices seem to be double the price of the Royal Lahaina. In my opinion, the beach is just as nice at the Royal Lahaina, but Black Rock certainly is great for snorkeling. There is a complimentary shuttle bus that takes you to the other side of Kaanapali if you don't feel like walking, but the pathway along the beach is hardly a chore to stroll along. The lobby of the hotel is dated, but the architectural details are beautiful. We had a partial ocean view tower room, and it was excellent. The rooms have been completely updated, but the Interior Designers did a great job of making it a modern Hawaiian style. The room features beautiful wood built-in furniture and details. The bathroom is well appointed, and each room has a nice deck with floor to ceiling windows. When in Maui, one generally has to accept dated styling in hotels / condos, but this is not so at the Royal Lahaina. I would go as far as to say the rooms are finished better than the majority of the high-end hotels on the strip (Hyatt, Sheraton, Marriott etc.). The restaurant / bar in the hotel is good, and there is nightly live music. The pool area is nice, and it's only steps to the beach. There is a cafe and ice cream shop if you don't want to sit down and have a meal, and if you walk 5 minutes up the road there are a few restaurants. We walked through most of the Kaanapali, Walea, and Kiheh resorts, and our conclusion was that the Royal Lahaina was hands down the best value per dollar.

We spent 5 days at the Westin just the other side of Black Rock and then moved to the RL. Best move ever. We have stayed in the Ritz, Westins, Beach Club and Wyndhams and more modest chains. I think the RL has put investment where it counts.The Royal Lahaina does not have massive river rides, impressive fountains or water slides, but really, is that why you go to Maui? Not us. The staff is superb, and the beach amazing. The entertainment in the dining room was a very unexpected surprise and a highlight of our stay. The singer (Kapulenui) and hula dancer (Wainani Kealoha) offer an elegant and graceful performance that the busy venue does little justice to. Hula is so much more than most people know. Wainani spoke with us about some of the history of the area and the significance of hula in the islands. Our flight home was late evening and with an 11 o'clock check-out, but the hotel offers luggage lock up and a courtesy suite you can use for shower and change prior to your heading out. Just a great touch. The hotel does demean themselves with an unfair portrayal of available internet. They offer a free hour of internet connection every 48 hours. What they provide is 'the first hour' of a 48 hour period at no charge. That is a subtle, but very important difference. If you think you can keep up with email and do a little web research at your leisure. Think again. I hope the commissions the hotel gains from the internet provider will very soon cause them to reconsider this arrangement.

It is located on a beautiful, private and calm beach with soft sand and our room had a nice ocean view. The pools were very basic and you had to walk across the parking lot to the small hot tub which was very hot. The lobby and elevators could use some renovating as it appears dated but the hallways and rooms are beautiful. The parking lot has the smallest stalls I've ever encountered. We got the parking package for $16/day that included free local calls, 2 free mai tais or non-alcoholic drinks/day and in room safe (without the package it is $4/day). However, it was a headache to get our drinks. At check out they wanted to charge us for our pineapple juice, which we had to argue was non-alcoholic and we had always verified with the bartender that we had the package before ordering. They ended up taking it off our bill but we thought that was unnecessary as they were non-alcoholic and we had only ordered drinks 2 of our 5 days there. Check in was ok - i would avoid the towels at the front desk as the towels smelled bad. They tried to get us in early but ended up giving us a room that had no safe even though we had just arranged to have the package. It was a bit of a hassle to change rooms - when I first called to tell them about the mistake, they told me there would not be any rooms with a safe available all day, even though it was only 12 pm and check out had just started and we were willing to wait. So we went to the front desk and they were able to find us a new room right away. I don't know if they were being unaccommodating or just confused on the phone. Besides the front desk, it was a pleasant experience at the Royal Lahaina. All in all, the hotel was great and we would definitely recommend it! Warren & Annabelle's is a must-see! We laughed all night and when it was over we were left wanting more. Good, clean humor with amazing magic. Warren was very engaging, extremely witty and connects with the whole audience. If you don't want to eat there, you can just show up before the show starts. They validate your parking for 4 hours but it was a bit longer so we were charged $2.

We had partial ocean view on the 10th floor, our room was right in the middle & had a spectacular view of the mountains to the left & the ocean, Black Rock & Molokai to the right. You could hear the waves & see the very visible stars. I slept with our patio door open most nights. We saw whales breaching the 1st morning & every morning we were there. I had asked for a (2) bed room but a king was only available that night, my sister had a 2-full room...I agreed to keep it for the night with a roll away (my 8yr old slept in it fine)...after seeing the difference in floor space even with a roll-away, I kept the King room for the entire time, if fact it was the hang-out room. It was beautiful, spa like & also had a canoe-theme...simple but elegant.. the king bed was so cushy & comfy, I slept very well & I usually don't away from home. The mini-fridge held alot more than 1st glance (gallon of milk, 1/2 g of juice, yogurts, fruit, lunchmeat, mayo & then some).

I had read most of the reviews prior to going, but expected that most of the negative reviews were people who were just being \"picky\". Unfortunately, that was not the case, and both my sister and I wished we had heeded what we had read here and made reservations to stay somewhere else. Due to using American Express plan, we were locked in to staying here. Upon arrival, the staff was friendly. Our first room was located on the ninth floor. When we walked in, the strong musty odor hit us very hard. We wanted to be able to be satisfied, so decided maybe it just needed to be aired out. We were unable to open one of the sliding doors to a balcony and had to call for help. Even after the door was fixed, airing out the room did no help. By then, my throat burned. We then went down and asked for a different room. The second room was as musty and bad as the first room. It too was on the ninth floor. We did request a third room, which was not nearly as musty and it did work for us. However, every once in a while we got strong odors of raw sewage. We also smelled the raw sewage smell in the lobby on two different occassions. Our room was NOT refurbished--it was very old and very worn. There were cracks in the ceilings and walls. The windows were filthy, looked like they are never washed. The doornob on the master bathroom kept falling off and had to be put back on in order to leave that room. The floor was not clean and we wondererd if it was ever mopped. The fridge did not work properly---we ended up getting ice from the machine, put it in plastic bags, and kept food cool that way. The air conditioning was blowing constantly and we froze. Finally we did find out from the front desk how to turn it down, and then it was much more comfortable. We were very dismayed that we had been told that we were in a refurbished room---FALSE ADVERTISING. Part of the place has apparently been renovated, but certainly not where we were!!!!! Housekeeping---Oh My! When we first arrived, the hide-a-bed was not made up. We called for linen so that we could make it up---we waited for 45 minutes, then called again. Fresh linen did arrive finally and we made up the bed ourselves. For the first few days of our stay, the housekeeping was adequate. Then, by day 6, the service dropped off almost completely. The housekeeping did not empty our garbage even though it was heeping. We ended up taking it down to the garbage can in the ladies bathroom in the lobby and emptying it ourself after it remained there for two days in a row after the housekeeping had supposedly been there, as the smell of garbage can get quite strong in the tropical weather. Housekeeping also did not leave clean drinking glasses or clean coffee mugs by around day 6 either. We opted not to have housekeeping even bother on two days at the end of our just because we felt with such extremely poor service we did not want to leave a gratuity that was not earned. We think the only thing they did was pull up the bed linens to make the bed, leave clean towels, and nothing else. The two things that were excellent there---The Valet service was the best we have ever had anywhere. They were prompt and courteous at all times. The second thing that was wonderful was the view. We had full ocean front view that made the atrocious rooms livable. Had it not been for the view of the ocean, I do feel our entire trip to Maui would have been ruined.

My first impressions of this hotel was not bad, the lobby was simple however a little dark and it appeared like an old hotel that had been refurbished. Our experience checking in was prompt and friendly with no issues, did I mention the friendly staff...good. Upon arriving to our room which was a partial ocean view on the 4th floor we found it to be very nice, clean and welcoming. There was the sound of waves hitting the shore line playing on the radio in the room which was a nice touch to set the mood. The room was definately refurbished and seemed to have a canoe theme going on which was nice. My only issue with the room was the washroom area which was a little dark, sorry to nit pick but it is hard to put on makeup when there isn't enough light, other than that we where very happy with the room. The daily maid service was nothing short of great and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. Now to describe the restaurant in this hotel it you could call it that, what an utter disappointment. The Royal Ocean Terrace is dated and dirty and has a very shabby menu. We didn't mind having the breakfast buffet there however the decor and cleaniness of the place had me on edge. From visible stains on most of the seat cushions to mounds of ants having there own meal beside you on the ledges, well you get the point. The dinner seating side seemed to be much cleaner however still very dated decor. Ocean views are the highlight here however is ruined by the dinner menu which seems to limited to appetizer style entrees if that makes any sense, or get a burger. I didn't come all the way to Maui to have a burger I tell you that. And lastly the service at the dinner seating is atrocious, it appears that they have 2 servers working the entire restaurant and than 2 bartenders and one greeter, which this is a seat yourself restaurant. This was not a one of because we came twice to see if it would improve and both nights where exactly the same. Everyone was very friendly however it just didn't make up for the lack of quality in food. The beach area is fantastic and less busy than on the other side of Black Rock which we enjoyed.

When we first arrived at the hotel the front desk gave us three choices of rooms to stay in. Before taking a decision I asked her if we could see the rooms, she allowed us to take a look at the oceanfront room she was offering. The rooms were on the right side of the building right where the Luau was held everynight. When we walked in the room, it was really really spacious but really really old. Not dirty, just very old looking, and nothing matched in the room. The room was ocenfront but they had made the balconies in a way where no sun could be reflected in your face during the day if sitting out on that balcony. What was the point? Also being next to a Luau for 3-4 nights would get to be too much after awhile. I didn't need to see the other cottages that she was offering because I knew they had not been renovated and must look the same as the oceanfront room. I decided to go with the tower rooms since they had been renovated with 44 million dollars of refurbishment. The room was georgous. Not a five star room but a big improvement from the other rooms. It seemed as if I was staying in a completely different hotel. We didn't see any cockroaches and the cleaning ladies came in everyday to clean, change the towels and make the bed. I'm glad I was in a brand new room because my partner and I were getting over severe bronchitis and were happy to know we would be in excellent comfort with great tv choice and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Key things when you're sick in bed with a fever. We did have a partial oceanview which is a little under-estimated because we had a clear view of the ocean and Molokai. The staff were wonderful. Some of the downfalls of this hotel are that the hotel is far from the city and buses are not reliable. They come once every hour and if you want to explore the city, you spend half your time waiting around for a bus to come. The restuarant at the hotel is very weak. The food is at best mediocre and extremely overpriced. Also the menu in the room for room service is outdated and doesn't even match the menu in the restaurant. I would only reccommend this hotel to elderly people. Not many young people there and feel this is a hotel for people over the age of 40. The beach is not very wide and most people spend their time by the pool for this reason. You can't lie your towel down without it getting wet at the beach.

Check-in was quick but we were reminded that we had booked thru a vendor (which I didn't remember). The bellboy drove us via the golf cart to our cottage which was Cottage R way in the back. He had barely left, the door wasn't even shut and the first big 2 inch cockroach greeted us! Welcome to Hawaii! I stepped on it and left it there for proof. I needed to use the bathroom and found another cockroach. The room was very musty smelling. I called the front desk requesting to be moved to another room. No apology at all but were told all rooms were filled. Now do you really believe that? I don't and were quite surprised they didn't offer us an upgrade to the towers or somewhere else! We were exhausted so stayed (without choice) but the AC kept disturbing our sleep going on and off all night. Early the next morning the waterpipes in the upstairs unit began to howl. This happened all the time when they were used and were so loud, especially at 11 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. We had no idea what the layout was and wandered onto an adjoining property the next morning....only to run into friends from our hometown who were staying at Royal Lahaina. They advised us to really make a big deal about the bugs. We went back to our cottage and the maid was just arriving. I showed her the bugs and she said it was very common due to the gardens. She offered to spray - we didn't want spray at this point. The gardens are minimal - it is a golf course and a few plants. I told her about calling the front desk the night before and she, too, said they were full. I still don't believe it at all! She was very nice but I asked her if this was just the way it was going to be? She assured me \"Yes, it would be and did apologize.\". Hmmmm. We found another cockroach in the shower that morning as well. The musty smell never left. The linens were very clean and the maid good but the bed was hard. We did like the location, however, as we only used this place to sleep and left for the day. The room is dark unless you have the drapes open to the lanai. Unfortunately, no one told us about the restaurants at the resort, etc. or we would have tried eating there instead of waiting forever at the nearby Basil Tomato place. In fact, we did not use any of their facilities which is unfortunate. We saw a trolley once, but again, no information was given to us in regards to times, etc. so we skipped that as well. After reading other reviews, I don't think the cottages are at the top of their list at all. It is too bad as they are unique and private and easy location to the rental car. We didn't care about the view so much but do think for the price it should be in working order with the doors fully able to open as well as the drawers not falling apart and hopefully no bugs. We do not like to deal with a lot of people and they are rather private (except for the noise from upstairs) and therefore bypass the hotel hassle, elevators, etc. We did not complain again since the only other bug was one on the bathroom light and then it disappeared. Upon checkout, the gal asked about our stay. I told her about the musty smell and the cockroaches. She shook her head yes and looked down, but no apology. I thought she must not care either! To my surprise, she waived the $10 per night parking fee due to the condition of the room which was appreciated, but the hotel rate should have been amended as well. Maybe I should have asked? Anyways, we will not stay there again. Instead of spending millions on the tower, they need to apply some $$ for maintenance of the cottages. Like I said, they are unique and private.

The Royal Lahaina is a much nicer hotel but the service is not as good. The Royal Lahaina has been recently renovated, make sure you request a renovated room; they are pretty nice, nothing too special but comfortable and clean. We usually travel to the Caribbean instead of Hawaii because of the price of everything. I had almost forgotten how expensive it is in Maui! We were happy to see there was a refrigerator in our room because we like to go to the Safeway in Lahaina and get cereal and milk so we do not have to pay $20 each for the hotel breakfast buffet. After we did our shopping we realized it is a mini-bar and does not keep everything very cool, we ended up having to get a cooler but it was not a big deal. The only real complaint I have about the room was that there is not enough light in the bathroom to put make up on. We had considered staying at the Westin or Sheraton, we did visit those locations, they were nice but I am not sure it would have been worth more money to be there. I would NOT recommend eating at the restaurants on the hotel property, very expensive for what you get. If you are going to go out go to the Plantation for breakfast AWESOME (worth the price!). If you want a nice supper find a place in Lahaina, we like KOBE. We attended the Luau as we had our three year old daughter with us and knew she would want to see it. The show is okay, no better than any other luau I have ever seen, the food is AWEFUL! Also, they say drinks are included, that is only four options, not any drink you want, all of the other drinks are $12 each.

We spent a lot of time at the barefoot bar watching whales breach and spout all day, enjoying some local beverages. The bartenders were awesome, Richard & Bill - thanks guys! They told us everything we needed to know about the area and what was fun to do and where to go. We spent a lot of time by the pools and on the beach. They have 3 pools, 2 by the resort and one up by the tennis court. Who needs a hot tub when it is 80 degrees outside? The pools aren't the greatest, but they serve their purpose. Brian from the activites center told us about the two great snorkle spots that were a 5 min walk up or down the beach. We rented gear from him and saw all kinds of sea turtles, tropical fish, and great coral. Renting a cabana for a day is a great idea, facing the ocean, and working on that tan. The Ka'anapali trolley is a great free way to get to whaler's village, and from there you can take the maui bus for $1 to get to Lahaina. We didn't rent a car and this was the best thing because the trolley runs all day and night and you can get to an from some fun spots with out having to worry about paying $10 a day for parking at the resort. Harold is the day driver and a real nice guy. We were there at the end of the holiday rush so we got to see the place empty out after the first weekend of the year. The whole first week of January we practically had the whole place to ourselves. The beach is great and the water was warmer than the pools. We went to the luau on a Wednesday, they perform this luau everyday of the week, so the dancers really knew the routine. They roasted a pig in the old Hawaiian fashion which was neat. The buffet and open bar were good, plenty of tasty dishes to try, and the bartenders have perfected the Mai Tai. A good suggestion is to pay the extra $15 per person to go to Don the Beachcomber at 4pm, you get VIP seating right up front and an extra 90 min of open bar. This bar is only open for the couple of hours before the luau. It is like a time warp because you can tell that place was built in the late 60's and hasn't been updated since. It has real character, and i wish that they would keep it open all the time, or do some updating to it. I loved that place, even though i only got to hang out there once. Our overall opinion about the place was great, going to Hawaii in general is really expensive, so why not save a bit of $$ and stay at a place that has a great location, even though it might not be as new as the other places.

We arrived at the Royal Lahaina after travelling about 16 hours, and the guy at the guardhouse gate greeted us with a very welcoming 'you are home now, Aloha' greeting which was a very nice touch. This guy in fact always welcomed you 'home' when returning to the hotel. All of the other staff was very welcoming and hospitable as well! We spent 6 nights here, but only a day or 2 at the resort itself, as we spent a day driving to Hana, a day up Haleakala, one day surfing etc. The resort is sooo lovely that I would almost like to return and just stay there for a few days without leaving the grounds. Great beach with wonderful snorkling about 5 minutes walk north from the hotel's beachfront. Brian, the super friendly guy at the pool activities kiosk told me that more fish and turtles can be seen at Black Rock (about 15 minutes walk from the Royal Lahaina - somewhat of a circuitous walk as you have to go through the grounds of the Sheraton Maui to get to that side of Kaanapali beach), but I'd say there's just about as many fish on the north side of the beach if you dont want to meander over to Black Rock. Which brings me to my only small tiny misgiving about the hotel. At the time I booked, I called the hotel to ask if internet access was included in the room rate, to which I was told 'Yes, it was'. When I arrived, I learnt that just a couple days prior to my arrival, the hotel started using a service provided by Skywave, which gives you something like free 60 mins every 48 hours, after which there is a 9.95 per day charge. The hotel manager on duty very kindly and expediently resolved this issue for me by giving me promo codes to use during my stay, so that I didnt have to charge my credit card. He explained they were doing this for guests who were told there was no charge for internet access when they booked, since they had only just started charging. It was very good indeed that the hotel manager did this for me, but it is one small thing that would make me think twice about booking there again now knowing I'd be charged for internet access in the future. (Admittedly this may not affect a lot of people, but only tech geeks like me who travel with VoiP phones and need internet access for just about any and everything they do - it is handy to consult websites whilst youre on holiday on where the nearest drugstore is or to get directions from mapquest etc:) All in all though, this is a stupendous hotel, and I'd stay there again if they waive the internet charges for me, or compensate my internet charges through a reduction in room rates:)", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cRelaxed week on Maui at a good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kathrin_73", "ReviewID": "UR23013632", "Content": "After 5 nights Waikiki Beach we arrived for a relaxing week on Maui, December 7-14.

Less than 5 miles driving distance you are in Lahaina. Kaanapali Resort has a free shuttle from all hotels to Whalers Village, a shopping area with restaurants, where I highly recommend Hula Grill - good lunch and dinner ocean front. The room was nice and clean. We have been on the 10th floor and have had a good view to the ocean and the island of Lanai. We have had every day breakfast a la carte at the restaurant and I highly recommend waffle with strawberry, whipped cream, macadamia nut and delicious coconut syrup - THE BEST you can imagine. Staff was okay, but nothing outstanding. The \"Irish\" waitress at the restaurant and our bellman were the best we have got in touch with. At the front desk I felt always like disturbing their talk. I always have got the answers to my question, but no much more - I definitely missed the Aloha spirit here. When we arrived we checked in with two rooms, which were assigned right next to each other, what was nice. I asked the lady to put my name with the king bed and my parents room with the double bed, but she just said: you just choose as you wish when you get to the rooms. And so it was exactly the opposite way and I always had to sign my bill with the room number of my parents... I do not know if it would have been so difficult to make it right from the beginning... They also did not make a note of my mothers name and when she got a message on her birthday, they did not know if we have somebody with her name in our party. Since the reservation of our rooms they have had all 3 names... Well, she received her message at the end. They definitely do not tell you anything about the package you can purchase for $16 a day, which includes 2 Mai Tai's, parking and local calls. Thanks to the reviews of Tripadvisor I knew about it and asked directly for. We have had dinner several times at the restaurant and it is good food they serve. Also here a small negative touch: at 8:30 pm latest they start taking table clothes away at the tables next to you, which are not occupied and to equip them for breakfast. You start to feel a little bit pushed, but well... The bar is open until 10 pm, not longer... For breakfast we have had often the same and had to realize even if you order the same, you do not always get the same. A pastry basket came one day with butter and jelly, another day without... Our waffle came twice with coconut syrup, one day without... You get everything after you ask for, but some thinks could just be a little bit less complicate. I am not a picky person, but at a 4 star hotel I expect a certain level of service, but they still have a lot of opportunity here and after being Assistant Manager at a hotel with 810 rooms in the Caribbean I know what I am talking about.

The lobby area, to the lounge, to the hallways to the rooms are all renovated. The only area left under construction to be renovated were the lobby restrooms.

SO pretty, beautiful wood, HUGE king size bed, the headboard took up the entire wall, HUGE wood desk, flat screen HDTV, nice bathroom and vanity, safe, mini fridge and the view! Very nice!!! Well worth the $$. They have a trolley that comes by about once an hour to take you to Whaler's Village, or wherever you want. We had just missed it, so the bellman took us in the golfcart on the golf path to the Sheraton and we walked to Whaler's Village from there to have dinner at Hula Grill. The next day after beach time and pool time, we cleaned up and went down to the lounge and chatted with Ricky who became our favorite bartender. He's a lot of fun and we tipped him well. The manager we spoke to quite a few times and he is very nice, the service at this resort is outstanding! We stayed in that night and had appetizers and dinner there. Very good food! The last day our flight out wasn't until 10:20PM. We called the front desk and they let us have the room until 6PM for 100.00. Worth it! That gave us almost another full day.

Except they don't show the lobby because it is HORRIBLE! Not 4 star lobby. The rooms in the tower are exactly what they look like in the internet photos (I will attach photos). Be careful when booking \"ocean front\" and \"ocean view\" because \"ocean view\" means you can see the ocean (even if you have to lean WAY out your balcony to see it). We booked ocean view and they took us to a room that was mostly parking lot below or mostly golf course. So we asked for a better view, they said something like there was a \"manager special\" to upgrade for another $40 a night....we said okay and were taken to a spectacular room on the 12th floor (the top floor). After my husband tipped the bell hop $20 he came back and said \"Oh there is no charge for the upgrade.\" I think that is a gimmick they do as I have read that on other reviews of this resort. They tell you they are \"upgrading\" you when in fact this is the room we asked for to begin with. So, I am not sure it is worth it to book ocean view or just get here and then wait for then to offer you and upgrade. Kind of odd. Now for the location....awesome. When you look at the photos online you see nobody on the beach and at first I thought that meant it was a lousy beach. Actually the beach is so close to my balcony I could throw a baseball into the ocean. The beach is deserted because it is a private beach pretty much. The sand is great, the water warm...really nice location. No waves if you are looking for surfing, though. Parking: we got a rental car at the airport because I don't think there is any other way to get to the hotel (it is about 20 mins drive to the resort from Kahaului (sp?) so you kinda need a car). Self park is $10 and valet is $15 so we went with valet since it would only be another $25 and we didn't want to hassle with it. Food: there is only one restaurant and it is expensive (everything is expensive on Maui...$20 per person per meal, expect). The breakfast buffet is $20 pp and so so. Just a regular breakfast buffet. My husband said the hamburger at lunch was one of the best burgers he has ever eaten and he is a hamburger expert. Whalers Village....not really a \"10 minute\" walk....more like 20 or 30 (I guess we walk slow) so we did that only one time and drove there the rest of the time. There is a trolley that is free that comes every 30 mins to take you from Royal Lahaina to Whalers and that is great if you don't have a car. They rarely follow the schedule though, as we saw our driver stop and pick up pedestrians and take all sorts of detours, so don't count on the trolley being on time. We ate at the Rusty Harpoon because they would put on the Dodgers for us and that was great! We also ate at the Hula Grill and that was good too. Now, after spending a ton of money on food, I asked the valet if there was somewhere good to eat that was cheap and he told us to go to Front Street. GO TO FRONT STREET!!!!!! There is a Burger King there and other cheap places to eat. It is about a 10 minute drive. Oh yeah, Whalers Village has a food court that we didn't realize, and they have fast food there...pizza hut and mcdonalds I think. So that is a cheap alternative too. Look for ABC stores. They are the best (cheapest) way to stock up on snacks and they are everywhere. They are like a mini mart so not that great of a selection. Make sure to stop at KMart or Costco when you arrive and buy cheap snorkel stuff and sodas or whatever you want for your room. The snorkel stuff and boogie boards are like $25 for the day at the activity center so it is better just to buy one. We got one at the ABC store for $5.99. It was cheap, but it worked. We drove to Hana the first day we got here. It was exactly as we expected. Make sure to get a book so you know where the secret waterfalls are. It took us 6 hours total to go there and back. Stop at \"Halfway to Hana\" and get a shaved ice. Big and yummy! Also they have really good banana bread and my husband said we should have bought more to bring back. We came for our 20th anniversary and got what we expected...total relaxation....no hurries....we could walk out of the elevator and be in the ocean in 2 mins and that is what we wanted. No bells and whistle at the Royal Lahaina, but we couldn't afford the other hotels for what we could get. We have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels and this is probably about a 3.5. The room is definitely 4 star, but the lobby and the lack of amenities (2 small pools, no pool side bars for snacks or chairs for the beach). We stayed 5 days and 6 nights and that was enough. We got the best deal on Hawaiian Airlines after searching Pleasant Holidays and Expedia.

The property has 2 pools, but we never did use them because we were too busy exploring the island. The beach is OK...but a little narrow. I was disappointed that there was no boardwalk to walk along the length of the beach, there was also zero lighting on the beach so it felt unsafe at night. There is great snorkeling to the west of the property-about a 5 minute walk. The breakfast buffet is good, but pretty expensive. The biggest complaint of the whole experience was the parking. You had a pay $10 a day to park and they squeeze as many parking spots as they can into the lot. Bigger people probably wouldn't even be able to get out of the vehicle the spots were so tight. Everyone got door dings. If you came back to the hotel late at night you would have to park a long ways away because of all the luau guests. Overall this hotel gets a big thumbs up!

My wife and I stayed there the first week of March this year. Try to get an even-numbered room on a higher floor (we had 1108) and you'll have a great view of the whales in the channel between Maui and Molokai. We spent a couple hours just watching them from the room balcony. The Royal Lahaina grounds are looking pretty dated, but the staff was helpful. Parking can be a pain, and the actual parking stalls are very narrow (though that seems to be the norm all over Maui). I had to crawl across from the passenger side to get in our car a couple of times. Rent a compact! We only had drinks at the hotel lounge. The food looked ok, but our drinks were tasty. The Pele Mai Tai is a good one! Service was slow unless you were sitting at the bar itself. The resort location is pretty good. It is about a 10 minute walk along the beach walk to the Whaler shopping center, which has (of course!) an ABC store where you can get any food you might want to have in your room or anything you forgot to bring from home. The cottages appear to be quite worn and tired. There is a sales office on site for some new timeshare condos which will replace them. If you are looking for a resort where you will spend much of your time, you might look elsewhere. We were looking for a nice room and not many other on site amenities, so the Royal Lahaina worked well for us. Almost forgot one thing-there is a somewhat cheesy looking Italian restaurant right at the edge of the grounds as you drive in called Basil Tomatoes.

Room had 2 double beds, which was not a problem since my wife and I like to sleep close anyway, but the bed was slanted to one side. My wife woke up with her back hurting. Our phone was not working (mouthpiece was broken) so I went downstairs to the front desk, and they proceeded to argue with me about the bed being slanted: \"The beds are new\", \"no one else has complained\", \"those are the only beds we have so there is nothing to be done\", etc. I was not willing to have my wife further strain her back, and I would not let them get rid of me, so after a while they agreed to send someone up to look at it. A maintenance man arrived later that evening, and i pointed out the visible slanting of the bed. He saw what i was talking about right away, and said he would be back to try to fix it. Later, 3 staff came up to mess with the mattress. Interestingly, they rotated the mattress, but the bed was still slanted the same way, which they acknowledged. Finally a manager came up and made a big deal of changing us to an upgraded room. I thanked him a bunch, and we all packed up our bags and went to the new room. It was EXACTLY identical to the previous room, down to the slanted bed. We couldn't believe it! I even picked up the phone and found it had a lot of distortion (but this one did work).

The grounds are very basic, comprised of a large lawn area, with several concrete pathways that are filled with cracks, potholes and finger/stick engravings in areas that were patched. There are two small rectangular pools on the ocean side of the grounds. The main drives and parking lots are unkempt, filled with pot holes and crumbling curbing. When we checked in, we were unknowingly checked into one of the \"cottages.\" When walking up to our cottage, we noticed the roof was covered in black plastic tarps. Upon entering the room, we realized immediately that the room was not in rentable condition. The mirrored closet door was off its tracks, there were holes in the walls, a broken towel bar, a wall air-conditioner unit that had an extension cord with electrical tape, and the bed had a lumpy mattress. Also, we discovered mold spores growing in the bathroom (see pictures we've uploaded from this cottage room.) Finally, the room was extremely dated (circa 1970s), dirty and smelly. Needless to say, we returned to the front desk to explain the condition of the room and get a new one. It became obvious that the hotel staff were quite accustomed to guests complaining about these cottages. Instead of expressing shock or concern when we described the abominable conditions, the front desk clerk simply said \"Uh huh, OK, ... let me see if I can find you another room in the tower instead.\" After waiting about an hour for another room to open up, we were given a room in the \"Tower\". However, the only room available was an ocean view, so we were told it would be an additional $200 a night (to stay in a clean room). We were so exasperated at this point that we took the upgrade after negotiating them down to $100 extra. What's completely interesting about this hotel is that the Tower rooms have been completely renovated. We were surprised that the rooms in the Tower are new, clean, modern and very pleasant to stay in. While the rooms are Tower are new, the rest of the entire complex is extremely dated and run down. In fact, the only renovations are the rooms themselves and hallways. The elevators are ancient, and the hotel lobby is dark, dreary, and outdated. Overall, this hotel and grounds looks and feels more like a giant apartment complex instead of a resort. In fact, after reading the prior reviews on here, it is absolutely bewildering how many guests have rated this hotel above average or excellent. Perhaps these guests are comparing this \"resort\" to motel chains. Thankfully we only stayed at this hotel for two nights. If you do end up staying at this hotel, considering visting the more upscale area of Kaanapali beach and resort. This area is on the south side of black rock. You can take a short boardwalk path from the hotel. Follow the path across to black rock. From there, you'll arrive at the back side of the Sheraton resort. Walk towards the tennis courts. Just past them you'll find a guest walkway that takes you to the hotel grounds, pool and public beach areas. Just down from the Sheraton is the Westin, Marriott and Hyatt hotels.

We found out later that they are scheduled to be torn down in March of '08 to make room for 3 story condos. There is some obvious termite damage and tarps cover most of the cottage roofs. The staff that we dealt with directly were very nice and helpful. We were advised to visit Costco at the airport before heading to Lahaina, so we didn't visit the restaurants on the premises. The two pools seemed nice, but we spent most of our time in the ocean. Our only complaint would be in trying to secure bedding for the hide-a-bed. When we pulled it out it was covered with ants and obviously hadn't been changed in quite some time. It took an hour for the sheets to arrive. We had asked for new bedding, which included blankets for padding. The young man who delivered the sheets said he would return with the rest of the bedding, but after another hour we gave up and went to bed.

Disgusting. Well we lost our appetite and went back to our room. We both looked at each other and said we have to get out of here.

Ate at the restaurant down stairs, nice food and good service. The guys at the Beach Hire Place were really helpful and gave us a free Cabana on quiet days. Snorkling outside the hotel was fantastic, good to do for an hour a day. Saw dolphins jumping close to the shore, that was great. The Good > Good value for $ > Quiet Location > Excellent Beach > Friendly Staff > Modern Room & Modern Furniture > Clean > Free access to the Ice Machine on every floor > Snorkling very close by (2-3 minute walk up the beach) The Bad > Getting to the Whalers village in Kaanapali was a bit painful. There is a free trolley that we felt runs when it wants (never really stuck to the time table it felt like). Best off getting a taxi and finding another couple. Although i think the taxi ride is about $5US one way. Alternatively if you plan to rent a car for part of the holiday, this is the place to rent it.

So i had to learn all about plumbing, because i wasn't going to call maintenance when I had the previous nights dinner on show.

I had no clue what to expect of Maui at all - I am happy to say it was a wonderful place to go to relax. I found the resort excellent in almost all regards. We got there before xmas so it was a little quieter.. towards the 24th lots of people started coming in but it still felt like it was a relaxing place to be. My family and I (mother and sister, 60ish and 30ish) spent almost every day lazing by the pool and then at the beach. The pool was wonderful - comfy chairs, a great place to read a book and listen to the Ipod, although the restaurant had outdoor speakers playing Hawaiian music which was really nice too... totally puts you in the tropical mood. The beach was excellent also - as someone who has been to Cuba and experienced the beaches there I can honestly say that this beach is a very close 2nd. Warm water, soft beach, clean, not busy at all. Only bad thing - no beach chairs - but it is a public beach after all, next time I'll bring my own. Our hotel room was a gardenview - meaning view of the golf course and cabins and ocean to the right. It was a great view from the 9th floor but unfortunately the highway was there and a little noisy. Oh well, the morning sun was excellent and we drank our coffee and read the paper every morning on our patio. Recent renos had been done and it was very modernized. Love the big HDTV! Only complaint was no microwave, and housekeeping was not always diligent about cleaning the coffee maker or giving us enough towels. We heard that in the future the resort is ripping down all the cabins and building low rise condos units - too bad - I think the ambiance of the garden view will be ruined that way. My only problem with this resort was the restaurant. Slow slow slow. And that's for the breakfast. We did supper there a couple of times and weren't impressed. First meal my mom sent her burger back twice because it wasn't cooked, and second meal was for xmas dinner, the MANAGER spilled a glass of water on our table soaking my mom, and the best he would do is move us to another table??? I think that at least warranted removing her meal from our bill. Also, the only other major problem at this resort (including bars and stores) is that they totally gouge you. Meals and drinks are very expensive... no big deal if you are out at a nice restaurant but these were at the pool bar and hotel restaurants. Up the road is a place called Basil Tomatos, I don't know if they're part of the resort but it was an excellent restaurant. The hotel offered many many different tours and things like that but we didn't do any of that stuff because they were whole day tours and we prefer to spend the day in the sun. I heard from another guest that the whale watching tours were really good though. The hotel has a free shuttle to Whaler's Village. So in summary - would I go back? Definitely. Very relaxing, but for those of you into nightlife.... this place is not your scene.... but bus and cab rides are easily available to take you to Front Street in Lahaina Town where there's tons of bars, restaurants, stores, art galleries to keep you entertained in the evenings... except for the 10 pm last call everywhere!", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cExcellent trip all round...\u201d", "Author": "WahineSurfer", "ReviewID": "UR11904108", "Content": "A friend and I stayed at the Royal Lahaina Resort last week for 6 days.

The restaurant was below our room, but you could not hear anything except the Slack guitar player in the evening which only added to the ambience of the killer views. We slept with the door open to hear the ocean. The rooms are beautiful, the beds and bedding are top notch in my book. Because it is slightly off the beaten path of Whaler's Village, it is more quiet and only a few families with children, most everyone was older. Very few people used the pools, which although they are not huge they are adequate since the beach is steps away. Did you really go to Hawaii wanting to swim in a pool? Some tips, most of the restaurants in town have early bird specials for breakfast and dinner, so check around. Maui is expensive, so the specials come in handy. Fuel was $3.82 per gallon the last week of November. For reference, the we got more TV channels at this resort versus the Sheraton Waikiki, plus the Sheraton charges $13.99 for a movie versus $9.99 here. All the hotels charge for parking, so get used to it. $10 isn't much when you are already spending hundreds on the room for a week. Costco is a good stop to stock up on staples, including alcohol. We stayed the week after Thanksgiving, which we were told is the slow time of year. Yes, it was probably more rainy than usual, but the sun was usually out for a few hours each day, enough to get a tan in a week. I would definitely recommend and stay this resort again.

Also, not the friendliest bunch that I have met:-). maybe they are underpaid.....who knows...... paid full price for ocean view, got to view the ocean by leaning precariously over the balcony :-). oh well...... 5 min walk to the parking lot, else you can pay $5 per day for valet....PLUS $10 for self parking hmmmm internet is pathetic. the wireless access points are few and they DO NOT work! if you talk to the our expert receptionist, u will again encounter the blank look coz they are thinking 'access what'????finally managed to get an ethernet cable by walking all the way to the front desk(might I add, it requires a deposit of $10 which will be not be refunded if you do not physically bring it back to the front desk ). Plugged the cable and still no internet. Arrrgggh.....At that point I gave up, took it as 'sign' and did not boot up my laptop for the rest of my stay. There goes the $ 20 per day resort fee :-(( Please do not spoil your morning by tasting the yucky complimentary coffee.The coffee shop downstairs has decent coffee. The resort is in a prime location, so really they are not very concerned about anybody's opinion.

If you are looking for a hotel to relax with family then this is a solid choice. If you're looking for something more exciting then you might want to consider a different hotel As you can probably tell from the other reviews the hotel recently was renovated. It is essentially completely done now (late Nov 2007). The decor they chose is not very beachy. The hallways are tan and dark brown with light fixtures that look like straw. Likewise the rooms are filled with dark wood and tan walls and carpeting. The decor is more 'mountain retreat' than beach resort. Currently, the rooms are immaculate, but I wonder how well they will hold up with people dragging sand and sea water in. We had friends staying at the Marriott which was down the beach, our rooms were much, much nicer than theirs. The pool is non-existent, especially when you compare it to the hotels down the beach. The beach is great, so it didn't matter to me, it's just that if a great pool scene is important to you then you might want to consider a different place. There also isn't much of a bar scene. The bartenders were great, but there are only about 20 or so chairs at the bar. On a rainy evening they were completely filled. The only thing that really irked me was the restaurant. We went for breakfast and were told that we must eat the buffet, the waitress literally refused to take our order. We never went back. Ask the staff how to get to CJ's for breakfast.

Maui was the last of 3 islands on our 2 week trip to Hawaii. We certainly saved the best for last! When we pulled into the valet area, my door was opened for me and I was directed to check-in. By the time I checked in, the bellhop had our car unloaded and my family (hubby and 2 kids, ages 6 and 8) waiting for me at the elevators. We were escorted to our room. When the door opened, I caught my first glimpse of the huge wall of windows looking directly out to the ocean. We had an oceanfront room, top floor. I loved the sound of ocean waves coming from the clock radio on the night stand. Nice touch. We were given a tour of the room and were told to call if we needed anything. Wow, the room was incredible! It was classy and comfortable. The beds were comfy. I liked the little sink/bar area, although the hinged mirror on the wall was a little awkward. It had a huge lanai with a table and chairs that faced the ocean. We had two double beds, a plasma TV, desk area, a nice bar area with two stools, a fridge, safe, and robes. The two pools are small, but never were crowded. Besides, you have the entire ocean right in front of the hotel to indulge in. There were always plenty of lounge chairs and towels for the taking at the activities desk. The activity desk guys will try to sell you everything from sunglasses to sunscreen to boat tours. They mean will, and were quite helpful when we were teaching our kids to snorkel. One day I asked for a good place to snorkel with kids. I was given a map with special instructions written on it, directing us on where to park and enter the beach area, etc. I think the activities desk guy (Kirk???) went out of his way to help us. Snorkel gear rental is pretty steep here. I think we paid $120 for 4 full sets of gear for 4 days. But, I guess it is all about convenience. We ate at the breakfast buffet once, and it was good enough. Adults were about $18 each, kids ate free. We would have never eaten here if the kids had to pay, too. Watch out for the pesky birds if you dine out on the patio. They'll steal scraps of food from your plate if left unattended for even 20 seconds. The kids had fun watching the mischief. We had breakfast at Cheeseburger In Paradise on another morning. That bill came to $60. Ouch. We had reservations for the Royal Lahaina Luau and paid extra for the premium seats. I'd definitely recommend paying the additional $15 for the premium seats. We didn't wait in line for food or drinks and had front row seats for the show. We found the show to be entertaining. It was our first and only luau, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I'd do it again. Being at the hotel was very convenient. Bring cash for the sunset family photos, though. I missed out because I didn't have cash and couldn't charge the photo to our room. I was sad to leave the Royal Lahaina. It was a great property for us.

So, we upgraded to an oceanfront room (i attached a picture of the view from our balcony) - for only $50 more a night. Definitely worth it. The staff was very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. Our room was serviced twice a day - cleaning in the morning and a turn down service at night. My one complaint would have to be with the room cleaning. We left the hotel to snorkel one morning at 6:30 and didn't return until 2:00 that afternoon and they still hadn't cleaned our room. This happened a couple of times and was kind of annoying, but we just went with the flow and stayed out by the pool and beach a bit longer. The hotel was lovely. The rooms were a good size, clean, and well decorated. The pools were nice and clean. Didn't have a problem finding a lounge chair at either pool. The beach was only a few steps away and just beautiful. I agree with the other reviewer, this hotel was very quiet.

From what we've read on here, normally honeymooners are upgraded one level in their type of room; in our case we had booked an ocean view room and were expecting to be upgraded to the deluxe ocean view. However they had no king beds available in deluxe ocean view but offered to upgrade us to ocean front at just $20/night, but would only get 2 double beds. The upgrade was well worth it as the view was just stunning, and the double bed was not all that different from the queen we normally sleep on. The food at the hotel's restaurant was very good although it was pricey which is to be expected for hotel food. The beach was excellent and not very crowded at all. The location was great as well. Just a few minutes away from Lahaina and all the activities there. The hotel itself is nested in with several other nice hotels and a golf course as well as the Whalers Village shops and several restaurants. A couple of issues: 1) Housekeeping. They did a good job don't get me wrong it just seemed they came around at odd times. There were several days where we'd go out in the morning and come back to the room mid-afternoon only to find our room still not cleaned. We'd put up the do not disturb sign while we were in the room for the rest of the afternoon and usually around 3 or 4 we'd get a call from housekeeping asking when it would be okay to come clean the room. It would've been nice if they came and cleaned in the morning since it gets rather warm in the afternoon and many people may want to retreat to their room before going out for the evening. 2) Thermostat. Now we're both pretty good with electronics but we could not get the thermostats there to work like we wanted to at all. Some nights we'd think we had the thermostat off or even switched over to heat and still the A/C would run all night making the room freezing cold. Finally we got the heat to run for a whole day then we couldn't get the A/C turned back on to cool it off even though the thermostat was set to cool. Since the weather was so nice, we opened the balcony doors during the times we were there most of the time, so it wasn't a huge deal. Just at night when we were sleeping it became annoying. 3) Water pressure. I assume the water pressure is probably low all over the island but it seemed very low in our shower. It would've been nice to have a little pressure to help wash the sand off of you after a day at the beach. Final Thoughts: Royal Lahaina was a great hotel in a great location.

(The following 4 nights were spent in Hana... review to come shortly.) When we checked in, we were sent up to our room with a bellhop to help with luggage. When we got to the room, it was right next to the elevator so we told the bellhop we'd need to go back and get a different room. He had us hang out in the rejected room, went downstairs and got 2 new room keys for us to check out. On his recommendation, we checked the one on floor 3 first, as it had better ocean views, and it was fine. (As other reviewers have noted, only the most expensive rooms face the ocean -- the others are on the side of the hotel and vary in how much ocean view you get. Our first room was on the parking lot side of the hotel, so there wasn't much view. The new room was closer to the front of the hotel, so we had a much nicer view. So, we appreciated the help of the bellhop, but were unimpressed that the front desk gave us the worst room on the floor initially. The rooms are quite nice with the renovation. The bed was far too soft for us (there's a featherbed on top of the mattress), but otherwise nice. There was only a shower (no tub). Nice amenities -- the soap is the scratchy oatmeal kind which we like. The small refrigerator in the room didn't feel very cold when we first opened it but did an ok job at chilling the water we'd bought at Target when we arrived. Some of the towels were obviously brand new and super fluffy, while others were more used and more typical. Apart from the rooms, the hotel doesn't feel very special. The pool is small and you have to walk through the restaurant to get to it (which is weird for both restaurant-goers and pool-goers). Luckily, we were spending time in Lahaina on this part of the trip, so we weren't planning to hang out at the hotel very much. Note that the hotel is not actually in Lahaina -- it's just north in Ka'anapali. Takes about 5-10 minutes to drive into Lahaina depending on the time of day. We never ate at the hotel as there are such good restaurant options elsewhere in West Maui. We opted to self-park instead of valet park to avoid the wait for the car to be brought around. The parking spots are tiny, and with all the American rental cars, it can be challenging to fit your car into a spot or get out of the car in the spot you've found. And as many people have mentioned, the luau does fill up the parking lot. (We found that if we returned from dinner after 8:30, it usually wasn't a problem.) The grounds of the hotel are quite limited. As I mentioned, there is the small pool (actually two small pools), and there are paths wandering around all of the cottages.

Both times we were assured that we'd get a king size bed and champagne (which turned out to be half the size of a regular champagne bottle) since it is our honeymoon. Well, upon checking in at around 9 p.m. after a long flight, we were told that we got a room with two queen beds instead. I was slightly upset but figured it was no big deal since we were used to sleeping in a queen size bed. However, when we actually got to our room, we discovered that they were two *double* beds. I was *very* upset at this point. Even my husband was upset. He called down to the front desk to ask for a room with a king size bed, even if it would be a downgrade (we were staying in an oceanfront room). They told him they had no extra king beds at all and that they were accommodating us by giving us a king bed the next day. Okay, yeah, well what about *tonight*? I thought I'd give them a call next. I got a hold of a manager and she explained how she was sorry and that they were worried about us the most since we had called a couple times before. She then went on about how they run out of king beds in the fall due to honeymooners and run out of double beds in the summer due to families. If this has happened before, why in the world could they not buy any extra king and double beds?! I told her that it was our first night of our *honeymoon* and now we have to spend it in a *double* bed. For a while she said there wasn't anything she could do, and I told her she better give us *something* for this huge mistake on their part. She finally agreed to pay for our parking. At least we got something out of it, but I still would have rather had a king bed our first night and pay the extra 10 bucks a day for parking. This incident really irked us. They should have a better policy in place to where priority of king beds go to honeymooners (and anniversary couples), especially if they are paying for one of the most expensive rooms (ocean front). I also must add that all of the workers we dealt with were very nice and remained calm, so I better give them props for that. I just wish they were more accommodating. Just a side note: the TV was NOT working and they shut off the water for the rest of the night while we were taking a shower. What a lovely first night, ha! The room: The room itself was amazing! The decor was modern and had a Hawaiian feel. Since the rooms were recently remodeled, the room was very clean. The king bed we got the next day was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Pillows were great too. The alarm clock was neat since it had the radio, the ipod thing and nature and spa sounds. You also have a phone but it costs a dollar to make a local call, which is ridiculous. Just use your cellphone if you have one. The mini fridge was nice to put the expensive drinks and snacks in. The in-room coffee maker was convenient to have in the morning while getting ready for breakfast. The bathroom stuff that you get includes hand soap, bath soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in a coconut lime scent. I wish the bathroom was a little bigger and had a tub in it, but we were fine with how it was. The view: The oceanfront view was gorgeous, but it would've been better if we weren't on the floor right above the lobby/restaurant (3rd). We were right there above the blue tarp thing and were able to hear loud people at night. Whenever I went on our balcony I felt as if though everyone could see me since we were so close to the ground. The housekeeping: They were all very nice and courteous. They checked on our room twice a day, which we thought was cool since people like to take showers after swimming in the salty ocean in the afternoon. The room service: We ordered room service dinner one night. They need more choices on the room service menu. The prices for the food is much too high for the quality you get. However, they were very quick. The maintenance guy was pretty quick too (about 10 minutes) when we reported a clogged toilet. The breakfast buffet: We were impressed. The food wasn't the best quality, but it was still pretty good! There were lots of choices, including pastries, sausage, fruit, french toast, made-to-order omelettes, etc. We actually met Flavor Flav our first morning here (celebrity; most known by his \"Flavor of Love\" show on Vh1). The parking: Yes, parking was a little tight but we were always able to find a spot so we never had to use the valet service. The worst times to find parking seemed to be at night (of course). The beach: Great access to the beach, and it never once felt crowded. Lots of great snorkeling opportunities just minutes up or down the beach. We saw an octupus one morning (but no turtles). We rented the gear at the resort even though we knew it'd be much cheaper elsewhere. They were very nice and helpful. I wish they didn't charge for the cabanas and that they would allow people to take the chairs to the sandy beach. The pools: Very simple, but nice for a freshwater dip. I didn't really care for the pools since we came to Maui for the ocean. Maybe in a few years they will upgrade them. The check out: Went pretty smoothly. As promised, we weren't charged for parking. We were sad to have to go back to the \"real world\". Other stuff: The elevators need to be updated. They were actually the freakiest elevators I've ever been in (not as bad as it sounds--but they were kinda shakey). I couldn't even figure out where the stairs were (if they have any). Plus sometimes in the late morning it took a long time to wait for an elevator. So, would we stay here again? If it wasn't for the first night, then yes. But it bothered us so much that we will only return after we've tried out different resorts and if those resorts weren't to our liking. I hope they realize they need to buy more beds to accommodate everyone, especially honeymooners. As long as our first night experience doesn't worry you, then the Royal Lahaina is a good place to stay.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "las vegas, nv", "Title": "\u201cAwesome uncrowded beach!!!!\u201d", "Author": "anywherewithwater", "ReviewID": "UR8740041", "Content": "Arrived at the hotel at 9 p.m..

We had just come from Oahu where we were spoiled in our condo there. Upon check-in--we had a horrible experience w/ a very slow employee. She had trouble finding two rooms together on the same floor. We had paid and booked for ocean views with 2 rooms together. She had to get someone else to help her..ppl around us were checking in left and right w/ ease. Once we got to our rooms on the 11th floor we found out that one of the rooms had 'partial ocean view' meaning you could see the ocean if you craned outside on the balcony. I called down to request the ocean view we paid for but they said since I could see the ocean it was ocean view. They had nothing else available. Be sure to request the even numbered rooms to get a better ocean view. The odd numbers were off the golf course area. I also had trouble with my AC unit. It would not cool my room for the life of me. I even put in a maintenance ticket and no one ever came. The beds are set up so that in order to sleep comfortably without falling out of them you had to sleep in the middle of them. Yes I did fall out and stumble out of them one sleepless night. The rooms also do not have curtains they have giant wooden doors that close over the sliding glass doors. I would have preferred to have light curtains or something so that you can have a little light in if you want. The hotel is pretty quiet and peaceful. They have 2 pools that we saw and used that were never crowded. The access to the beach is very nice. We ate in the hotel restaurant for one of their sunset dinners. It was nice enough. The food and drinks were adequate but not for the price. We also attended their luau. We were told by the front desk and on our tickets that the luau started at 6:30 and we were to be there by then. We could see the luau from our room and saw that ppl were already down there..come to find out it started at 5:30. So be sure to double and triple check the start time of any of your activities. If you haven't been to a luau yet it's worth checking out but it's a little trashy and might be too sexy for youngsters. The hotel is close to the Whaler's Village and Lahaina for shopping/food.

In addition to spending 8 nights at the Resort, we held our wedding and reception as well as attended their Luau (40+ guests). Upon check-in not only was our room \"not\" what was expected two of our guest that evening had to change rooms three times before we found one that was even suitable. The front desk was absolutely rude and unwilling to work with us. I immediately worked with the sales office who guarnateed the remainder of my guest checking into the resort would have the pre-assigned rooms as agreed. Of course, the front desk again, refused to honor the pre-assigned rooms and I spent the week of my wedding ensuring my guests had the rooms the were guaranteed and paid two nights deposit months in advance. The resturant bartender was very insulting and disorganized... they have a wonderful drink served in a pineapple that we encouraged and purchased for our guests as they checked-in. Unfortunately, one evening I purchased six of these drinks, four out of the six had ants crawling all over them... while I understand that given the juices of tropical fruit, when bringing it to the attention of the bartender, he refused to remake the drinks, nor compensate us for the cost. After my mother had an ant in her mouth, I insisted on speaking with the resturant manager and requesting that all drinks be compensated, which he kindly did for us (Thank You). It was insulting that I had to escalate this to management to begin with. I will admit that the upgraded Tower rooms are beautiful and the beach access is amazing. However, it is in your best interest to ensure you have a pre-assigned room with \"full ocean view\" and not believe that your confirmation with ocean view is correct, unless of course you are okay with a sliver view of the ocean while you overlook the roof of the carport and restuarnts.

The Sheraton could not put us up the last night (a Saturday) so my husband called all over West Maui trying to find a room. We finally found one at the Royal Lahaina. We had a little trouble finding it (poor signage - drive through the golf course), but the gentleman at the gate was delightful and parking was easy in the early afternoon when we arrived. The hotel is comprised of a 12 story tower and numerous free standing buildings. The free-standing buildings look like they have not yet been updated, and the lobby of the tower is looking a little tired, but the rest of the tower has been very recently updated and is very nice. Our check-in was painless though we were told we could not yet go to our room (only 12:30pm). When they found out we were only there for the one night, they told us we would get an upgrade if one was available. We left our luggage and went into Lahaina for the day/evening. We came back at 10pm and had a little trouble finding parking because the luau was still going on, but not a big deal. We got our key and went up to a gorgeous full-ocean-view suite (for which we'd paid the going rate for a partial ocean view regular room) with huge den, bath with huge walk-in shower, and a lovely bedroom with an extremely comfortable bed. The furniture and design were Polynesian flavored and very tasteful (though the bath is what I'd call \"very upscale US with EU influence\"), each of the main rooms had their own lanai - one with a spectacular full ocean view and one witha very lovely partial ocean/mountain. They even have the louvered doors like you see frequently in the Carribean so you can leave the doors open to catch the breezes and the morning sunshine, but stil have privacy (I prefer the breeze to air conditioning). The next morning we enquired and found out the rack rate for that room is $800/night. We had a very tasty (and potent) Mai-tai at the bar and walked out onto the beach for an hour in the late evening. It's very nice and dark (unlikethe other side of Black Rock), so you can actually enjoy the stars and a kiss or three if you desire. :-) The living room has a huge plasma TV, coffee maker, refrigerator, and lots of storage, art and books, though we didn't really have an opportunity to utilize it (the bedroom also has its own huge plasma TV). We slept very well in the bed and awoke to morning sun streaming in lazily through the louvered doors of our lanai. Breakfast, though not terribly speedy and yes, our waitress had a bit of attitude as is reported in others' reviews, was very tasty, and eating outside was lovely. My husband had the buffet, which had a huge range of foods, and I ordered from the menu (I recommend the blueberry pancakes - get the short stack). On the downside, the pool is rather small and the beach is not as good for swimming and such because the current is a little stronger on that side of Black Rock. It's not bad, it just isn't as good as the beach on the other side where the Sheraton is located. The Sheraton is only a 2 minute walk away though, with a very lovely beach perfect for a family day outing and kids playing in the surf for hours on end. The Royal Lahaina's beach would probably be best for adults who want to get in the water, paddle around a bit, perhaps do a little snorkeling (there are nearly always sea turles on this side of Black Rock near the rock itself), then head to other pursuits. There's a shuttle that takes you around to all the hotels in this area and to Whaler's Village for more restaurants and some shopping, you are right on a lovely golf course, the views are tremendous, and we felt the service (except for the waitress at breakfast) ranged from very good to excellent. This will be a particularly lovely place to stay once all their upgrades are completed, but even now, if the pool is not a particular downside for you, and you don't mind walking a couple of minutes if you have to park a bit further away from the tower (ie, during the luau), it's a bargain for what you're getting.

The Room: We originally booked an Ocean View room (in the tower), and got upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View room upon arrival (it was a complimentary upgrade for Honeymoons and Anniversaries). I was a little disappointed because the Ocean View and Deluxe Ocean View rooms are what I would call Partial Ocean View. You still get to see the Ocean, but you also have a view of the parking lot, and of the rest of the resort. I was expecting to stay in one of the *front* rooms, that have nothing but beach/ocean to see, but that was not the case. I called the front desk to ask, \"If this is an ocean view room, what is a partial ocean view room?\" They lady at the front desk told me that the rooms with a total ocean view were in a different price category. Again, the room was not bad, but I was disappointed because of my expectations (If you stay here, don't assume that an Ocean View room is a view of *only* the ocean) -- I'll post pictures to show you what we saw from our \"Deluxe Ocean View room). Other than that, the room was nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. (Extremely comfortable is an understatement.; the bed was heavenly). The Beach: This beach is located on the north-side of \"Black Rock\". The Sheraton and The Whaler are on the south-side. This part is really a comparison of the 2 sides (north & south). The north-side (Royal Lahaina side) was less crowded, but had more pebbles and small rocks on the beach. There was also alot of rocks where the waves came in; You had to go out further to get away from rocks at your feet. The south-side is more crowded, but the sand is much nicer. There weren't any pebbles or rocks on the south-side, which made it much more pleasant to walk from the top of the beach to the water. It also made wading around in the water much more pleasant. Activities/Dining: The Royal Lahaina side of \"Black Rock\" had very little to do. We spent most of our time on the other side of \"Black Rock\" (the Sheraton and Whaler side). That place had much more nightlife activity. Many restaurants, and shopping; I usually don't like crowds, but the atmosphere was just better on the south-side (near Whaler Villiage). My Recommendation: This is not a bad hotel. But, next time I go, I would try to stay a little further south on Ka'anapali (perhaps the Whaler). I haven't compared prices between the 2; if this resort is considerably cheaper than some place like \"The Whaler\", then I would stay again.

Our room views were very nice though I had been told when I called that we would probably be upgraded which didn't occur. The lobby and other parts of the hotel need to be updated. The hotel has two fairly small older styled pools and a nice quiet beach, although a lack of shade on the beach makes it tough to stay for long. Also, no chaise lounges on the beach, nor are any allowed. This is not the case at the Sheraton Maui. The Royal Lahaina beach is north of Black Rock. This means if you wish to be on the main side of Kaanapali beach you need to walk to the Sheraton and cut through their property. My reason for not giving an excellent rating is the very poor service in the dining area and conseige. We had the rudest waitress the first afternoon we arrived wait on us if you can call it that. She complained about being busy (3 tables), gave us the wrong dishes, dropped them off and never asked who ordered what, then when my husband went to check said well they're both tuna so what's the difference. The table next to us was never cleared off so the birds were having a field day. First and last time we ate at the hotel. My husband went to check on when we needed to check in for the luaa which we signed up for the luau at the hotel. My husband was met with check-in is at 5:45 pm. with no willingness to help answer his question. When we arrived at 5:30 pm there was already a huge line who had checked in. So, we ended up way in the back not being able to see the entertainment. Also, there are only 3 small elevators so plan to wait 5 to 10 minutes to get an elevator. As long as you don't plan to spend much time or eat at the resort then this should be a good place to stay. However, if you are looking for an all inclusive resort consider someplace else.

We booked a garden view room through a travel agent. We were on the 4th floor S. side. The view was better than expected and the remodeled rooms are great. We heard absolutely no noise from the rooms above, below or next to us. The TV was nice not that we saw much of it. Shower is fairly new but water pressure and temps were good. We paid for the Valet and resort fee 21/day which includes the safe and Mai Tais. We loved the safe and it was easily accessed by location and codes. There was no microwave but did have small fridge that met our needs. There are very nice quest robes in the closet and plenty of hangers. The sink and vanity are a bit awkward as the sink sits kind of far back on the counter harder for shaving and the lighting my wife tells me is not the best for makeup although she looked great to me! She did also note that for being so new there were a few stains on the carpet that should have been removed. The beds and pillows were very welcome at the end of the days. The balconies on the sides of the building are not very private by way of design (had to wear clothes) but the views were great especially after living in AZ. Ocean front balconies are more private. We could still see some ocean and the other island from the balcony along with the trees and mountain to the East. The staff was great, especially the valet guys. Very quick every time and we did come and go a lot. Jordan was a very big help with all our questions. We both smoke so we had to do so away from the building. There is an area not too far from the front doors and it is fairly nice with a place to sit. At the pool area we just made sure we were not too close to others which is easy to do since it was never really crowded. If you take the road to Hana be sure to get the CD offered at the Shell station on the way. The CD is invaluable if you have never been and includes map. It was $20. We stopped at all the stops and detours mentioned on it and our round trip to the 7 pools and back including dinner was about 11/12 hours. We left at 7 and back before dark. We only ate at the hotel once and had the sunset special which was ok but nothing great. For breakfast we recommend Moose Magilicuty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (I know I butchered the name spelling it). It is in Lahaina and the portions are big and inexpensive. They have a very wide variety. Wonderful place for breakfast! I still think about it. The one thing I would like to see is a nicer pool area. The pools are clean but very plain. I could see people not choosing this hotel because of it but I feel at this time the hotel and beach views and location make up for it. As far as activities if you are good at managing your time it is well worth it to book ahead of time. Prices can be found for much less when booking on line before you go. We chose to get swimsuits after we got there and glad we did. So much to choose from at Whaler's Village and in Lahaina at the same or less price than back home.

We had a beautiful view, the room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. Originally, we had booked a cottage and ended up staying in there for two nights. I immediately requested a room in the Tower when we arrived at the cottage room because I was so dissappointed with how old everything was. When I unplugged my blowdryer from the socket, the whole electrical box behind it came out with it. The room was clean but everything was so worn out and musty smelling. It reminded me of the smell an abandoned house has. We spent the night of arrival and the next night in the cottage as there was nothing available in the Tower until the third night. I was so relieved when we finally moved to the Tower. What a difference! Of course we gave up the space of a cottage, but it was just my husband and myself so we certainly didn't need it. The difference between the cottage and the room in the Tower was night and day. Needless to say, we had a wonderful time after we were moved. The staff is really friendly and helpful and were very patient regarding our request to change rooms. The moved all our things to the new room for us while we were out sightseeing (and I don't pack lightly). The food in the restaurant was very tasty, but a little pricey. We ate on Front Street a lot anyway. There is a 24 hour Safeway not far away from the resort so we stocked the little fridge in our room with fruit and yogurt, etc, from there for our breakfasts. The resort beach is just wonderful and the 2 pools are nice, too. Parking can be a bit of a pain, so we paid the 16 dollars a day for valet, which was totally worth not having to try to find parking on our own. I would not recommend the \"upgrade\" on this parking package, though. It costs about another 5 or 6 dollars and you get the use of a safe (which we didn't need) and 2 free drinks in the Beachcomber lounge (we are not big drinkers). The other restaurant on the property is Basil Tomatoes. It has very delicious food..but again, was very pricey.

Only this I have to complain about was the shower. Granted, the bathrooms need a makeover, but every time we took a shower, the water would not drain properly. While the room service lady was very nice in trying to get maintenance to come over and fix the problem, but we didnt want to be bothered. It was not the end of the world. Keep in mind: Hawaii is EXPENSIVE. What you concider to be 5 star on the mainland, does not compare to what you find on the islands. Do I think we payed a lot for what we got? Yeah, probably. But was it a good price in comparison to the other resorts within the same area? Definately. If you would rather spend upwards of 400-500 dollars a night for a little better this and that...then go for it. Kaanapali Alii is down the street. Like I said...I can vouch that cottage M is great. The others...I dont know...some of them looked a little skanky. As for the beach...beautiful. It was a tie for us between this beach and another (on north Maui) for best on the island. You get all the beauty of Kaanapali Beach, but without ALL of the people. Every single day we were out there, it was perfect. Our room was litterally STEPS from the beach, eventhough we got a garden view room (Ask for cottage M!).

Also, I really loved the fact that there were very few screaming kids. I feel for parents, I do, but when one wants a quiet getaway, nothing is more upsetting than loud kids. I can only turn my iPod up so high. The small pools and few activities clearly lure new parents to the pricier resorts. The rooms in the tower are small but newly refurbished. Brand new linens, flat screen TV, and tons of towels. I heard the cottages will be gradually razed over the next few years to build bigger cottages. The luau wasn't spectacular, but hey, it is right there - how convenient is that? And if you valet your car (highly recommended), you never have to compete with the luau visitors for parking.

We were quite excited to lounge on the beach and enjoy the warm weather of the islands. We were both on edge to book for a hotel as this would be both our first time in Maui, and, of course, we wanted it to be a perfect honeymoon experience. I really did luck-out when we discovered Royal Lahaina Resort on our web search. We knew we wanted to be right on the beach, but also close to the town of Lahaina where all the activity is--shops, reataurants, etc. And, RLR was the perfect place for all the things we were looking for in a honeymoon vacation. The RLR Tower is newly renovated as mentioned in their website. We picked out a very reasonable package deal which included a room with a waterfront view, full breakfast every morning, and a rental car. It was a great value--not to mention our trip planning was made convenient for us. RLR is a perfect place for couples for a romantic retreat because the hotel has this traditional Hawaiian feel to it, but with all the modern room amenities. There was not a lot of traffic and kids screaming and roaming about (they're all at the bigger hotels). Thus, this contributed so much to the calm and serenity of the place. The grounds was lovely with lush garden landscaping. Breakfast-dining can be done al-fresco overlooking the beach. Breakfast was abundant and yummy served in buffet fashion. The waitstaff at breakfast were so accommodating and friendly. They made sure that they attended to the guests needs besides breakfast. They offer reliable tips on dining, driving directions and local hot spots in the area. I didn't have to go to the concierge for this; although, every service staff was very helpful and eager to attend to the guests' needs. The views from our hotel room was just fantastic--panoramic view of the beach, the ocean. It was absolutely breathtaking. There were two pools, but you won't need it as the beach is so much better to bathe in. I love the fact that the hotel is so close to the beach and has easy access to it. Also, there is something noteworthy about the location of the hotel itself on the strip of Ka'anapali Beach. A lot of resort hotels are bunched up on this beach, making the beach very crowded. RLR, however, has the best beach on Ka'anapali. You don't see the neighboring hotels as they are quite a distance from the property. RLR's beach also has the best slope while other hotels have beaches that abruptly slope into the water. The only downside to our stay was that there were still some ongoing renovations. One of the elevators was in a really bad shape. Worse, the suite next to us was being worked on. One morning when we were planning for sleeping in, we were woken up at around 7 or 8 am by some loud banging. When this did not cease and after we were fully awake, my husband got frustrated and called up the manager to complain. He told me that the manager was gracious enough to have himself available immediately and was respectful to hear and sympathize with his complaints. Not only did the manager apologize, he also took off a good amount of discount from our total hotel charges. Aside from that (and, oh, I wouldn't recommend the luau at the hotel), we had a lovely stay at RLR. We scouted the other hotels on the beach, and I really think we picked out the best one on Ka'anapali.

There was very minor construction noises and you could tell that the lobby and elevators hadn't been updated yet... but non of the minor problems could out way the rooms and view. That said, the beach was incredible. Rated #1 in Maui. Sandy beaches out front of the hotel and great snorkeling can be found 1000 ft in either direction. The staff was great. Say \"How's it\" to Wayne (the bellman) for me. He was super friendly and has a great knowledge of the best places on the island. A couple of suggestions: There is a SafeWay and Long's Drugs in Whalers Village. You can go there and get a case of water and some beer and snacks and keep them in the in room refrigerator. They also have a single serve coffee maker in the room that you can get pods for. We packed a bunch of snacks in some tupperware and brought it along as one of our checked bags. Then when we left we had an empty bag to put our souvenirs in. The best suggestion we can give you is Moose McGillycutty's. It's a restaurant in Downtown Lahaina. They offer a $1.99 breakfast from 7:30-8:30 and even if you don't wake up early enough, it's only $4.95 after that. Say hello to Michelle for me too. Check out the surfing at Honolua Bay. Awesome. Not for beginners. Check out the winery on the way to the volcano. And don't forget about Big Beach. (and little beach if you like it topless) All-in-all, it was great. Maui was great.

We were upgraded to a Delux Ocean View room on the 9th floor. Although the hotel is still pouring millions of dollars into renovation, we were never disturbed with dirt or noise. Our room was immaculate with fine linens, beautiful wood cabinetry, and a view of the ocean, mountains and sunset views to die for. The only thing we would have expected in a hotel in this price range would be an in-room safe. It seems as if there is a perfect location in the alcove above the coffee maker for installing a safe so maybe one is planned for the future. The parking lot was a bit hectic in the evening around the time of the very popular luau. They are trying to establish a special parking area for luau guests, but it seems they still need to work on this. The robes, toiletries, plasma screen TV, super hi-tech radio/alarm/ipod features were great. We didn't go to the pool, but it looked clean and inviting, not enough time. The convenience store on-site was expensive, but had all the necessities if you needed a quick snack, sunscreen, etc. The location is wonderful for getting around the island. The beach is beautiful and I could see that a wedding on-site would be gorgeous. I forgot an important business manual when I checked out. All it took was a quick phone call to confirm that housekeeping had found my binder and it was no problem to return to pick it up.

We were on the 11th floor of the newly renovated tower and our room was just what I was looking for. The decor was what I thought of a typical Hawaii hotel room to be with the dark wood and shutters, a paddle on the wall and and a great bathroom. The bed was unbelievably comfortable as once my husband and I lied down we couldn't keep our eyes open. We had a great view of the ocean, the golf course, and the mountains. The buffet breakfast each morning was great and pretty reasonably priced considering we had just come from a very expensive hotel on the Big Island. We walked to Whaler's Village everyday along a path that took about 10-15 min. where there are shops, restaurants, more of the big hotels and met our snorkel boat cruise here. The parking at the hotel was a little annoying as it was hard to find a spot but there is always the option of doing valet for only a couple of bucks more. The pools were nothing spectacular but we didn't mind them as they weren't too crowded, it was easy to get a lounge chair compared to the other hotels where you have to get up early and hold your spot in a sea of chairs. There's also the option of the beach which is right by the pool and it's beautiful. You can see whales just from sitting at the pool. The sunsets are great as well. It is only a short drive into Lahaina where there are an abundance of restaurants and shops.

Beautiful clean sand, sheltered from the stinging wind that was sandblasting the hotels further north on this same beach, and snorkeling in coral is just a few hundred yards up the beach.

They are currently working hard to renovate the hotel which was really needed and should really improve the property when completed. We were not aware of the renovations at the time of booking, unfortunately, and were not made aware until we received our final travel documents. But, the renovating noise or potential mess did not cause us any problems. Yes, half the parking lot was taken up with construction equipment, but the parking spaces have always been very small and plans are in the works for a future parking ramp. We stayed in newly remodeled rooms that are very nice. (Check out the Royal Lahaina website to see what the new rooms look like with soothing color schemes and dark woodwork.) Our children had an especially nice room with a bar area with bar stools. Because renovations are still in progress some of the amenities they list on the Royal Lahaina website are not yet available. There were no in-room safes and no wi fi -- yet. That was frustrating as we have always used the safe in the past. Although you can always use the front desk safe, I had no desire to stop there several times a day to drop off valuables. One of the things I like about the Royal Lahaina is the size of the hotel's tower. It is not very large so it is easy to run back up to the room if you have forgotten something. And, one of the things I love is the beach. It is just a beautiful stretch of beach that is not very busy. It is getting busier at the far end where Westin is building. Also, the location is wonderful! It is about a 50 minute drive from the airport. Once at the hotel, you are close to Whalers Village and Lahaina for shopping and restaurants. We have never stayed in the cottages and I wasn't really aware of the Royal Hale area. If you go, make sure you stay in the main tower. The biggest downside of the Royal Lahaina -- and this is huge for people like us that are traveling as a larger family -- is that as part of the renovations all the connecting room doors were covered over. There are no adjoining rooms! This was unbelievable to me. Yes, the soundproofing was better, but what are they thinking for families?? And, they assured us before we came that we would have no problems with our reservations yet neglected to tell us that there was no way we could have adjoining rooms. This is enough of a problem for us, even though our four children are a lot older now, that I don't know if we'll go back to this hotel. We may have to investigate condos instead.

We were able to sit poolside or on the beach or in the lounge most afternoons and have a front row seat to whalewatching. Yes...it is currently under construction, but the construction noise was very tolerable. Yes...there are parts of the hotel that are a bit outdated and will be replaced as the renovation is completed. My biggest complaint would probably have to be that parking spots were too small and too close together. I suspect that is due to the fact that part of the parking has been taken over by construction equipment. Hopefully, once the renovation is complete they will make the spaces a wee bit bigger. I would strongly recommend the Royal Lahaina to most any family traveling.

Upon our arrival, I asked for a cottage which they gave us, but the cottage was in bad shape. We encountered roaches in the room which was unnerving. We also found out while checking in that the hotel charges $10.00 per day for parking and/or an optional package for $16.00 per day that includes the daily parking fee, 2 drinks at only one bar, coffee in your room and usage of the safe in your room. You can only order a Mai Tai, so if you like beer, you are out of luck. We paid the $16.00 because they will charge you separately for each thing anyway. We couldn't lay out by either pool because the construction noise was so loud you couldn't stand it. Also, this resort has a Luau every day and we had a difficult time trying to find a place to park; even though they designate hotel guest parking, people park anywhere they can. And, to top that off, the construction crew have huge trucks they park in our guest spots. Go figure! The staff was very accomodating even though they are down to the minimum. They are renovating the tower, plan to tear down all the cottages and are putting up condos and time shares in their place. The grounds are very beautiful and the beach is great. I believe when they get finished it will be a great hotel to stay at, but most likely very, very expensive. I also would suggest not to go on the dinner cruises. The boats are very, very old. We took the boat cruise over to Molokai and that boat needs to be taken out of commission. It is horrible. We saw a tremendous amount of construction while we were in Maui and I assume once they finish all the new hotels, condos and time shares ( alot of time shares), the price of a hotel room will be out of reach for some.

We had the honeymoon package which included buffet breakfast each day, complementary champagne on arrival, a sunset dinner sail, and the luau on premise. We arrived after a LONG flight and check in was a breeze. We opted for the 16 dollar fee that included coffee, parking, phone calls, safe, and your 2 mai tais at Don the Beachcomber each day. Well worth it. We stayed in a beach cottage, it was decent sized, clean, and gave you a sense of privacy. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RESORT VIBE! The decor is in need of updating, but they are in the process of a multi-million dollar renovation, and from the looks of the plans, it should be pretty amazing when complete. The overall location is great too, as you don't have to deal with a lot of the West Maui traffic from the Kapalua resorts and it is more central to popular tourist destinations (Haleakala, road to Hana, Waleia), you are also walking distance from Whalers Village, a cute shopping area with some good restaurants (we ate at Hula Grill). We ate dinner there the first night and it was well above average. The fish was very fresh and the waitstaff was attentive. In fact, I cannot say enough about the staff. They went out of their way to make sure our needs were met. An upside to the renovations taking place was that the resort was booked at only about 20% occupancy, you felt like you had it to yourself, never had to worry about seats at the pool or bars, and got to know most of the staff. The breakfast buffet was far superior to many of the buffets I have had at carribean all inclusives- the Hawaiian \"POG\" juice is really really good (try with vodka later in the day for a great cocktail that is a refreshing break from the super sweet mai tais). There were alot of birds flying around if you ate breakfast outside, didn't bother us, but may bother some, so felt it was worth mentioning. Throughout our stay we ate our dinners elsewhere, but had many snacks/lunches on premise, we were never disappointed. Don the Beachcomber is a little dark and musty, but the drinks are good, and the staff friendly, they don't have a food menu though, just pretzels and wasabi peas at the bar. There are two pools, both were kept neat and clean, with no problem getting a seat. The only thing was that there wasn't much shade and the sun is HOT! There is a small bar next to the pool closer to the beach. One thing that was disappointing to me (a true beach bum), is that you couldn't bring the chaise lounges to the beach. If you wanted to lay on the beach directly you either were on a towel or blanket, or brought your own chair. The beach was very secluded though, something that seems to be harder and harder to find on Maui nowadays, so that was nice. The luau was a lot of fun, only one I've been to so I can't compare. Staying at the hotel does mean you get to jump the line. The staff was fabulous, funny, and went out of their way to put on a good show. The buffet food was great as well. The sunset dinner sail was a good time, virtually everyone was a honeymooner, food was tasty as well. The honeymoon package was definitely the way to go. My husband and I also had the pleasure of being on Maui for the earthquake...the Royal Lahaina went out of their way to make guests feel comfortable and reassured. The entire island was out of power till around lunch time, and the staff kept replenishing complimentary juices, coffee, breads, and pastries. The hotel staff barely skipped a beat.

We did not expect much as we were staying for 3 nights before heading to The Four Seasons and this was going to be our \"cheap\" stay. But despite that, we were shocked at how disgusting this place was. Upon entering the lobby, it is like being transformed to 1965 - picture an old episode of Hawaii 5-0. Nothing has been changed since then, the decor is still trapped in this decade. Okay, hopefully the rooms would be better, but upon receiving a key! A real key - I knew we were in trouble. I cant remember the last time I stayed at a hotel where they still used keys and not swipe cards. It didnt even come with a key chain, just a key in an envelope. The room was disgusting! Tiny, and we were upgraded to an ocean view. Small terrace overlooking the ocean on one side and the noisy remodeling construction on the other side. Umm, a little late to remodel no? I mean this was long over due since the Carter administration. Our bed was hard as a rock, the blanket was disgusting and cheap quality, the pillows - all 2 of them, were flat and dirty~! The lovely green carpeting had stains on it. The AC barely worked, but we did have a ceiling fan that was about to fly off its hinges and out the window. The safe, which was an extra $4 a day, looked like an World War II era industrial Nazi piece of machinery that barely worked. Ive seen nicer bathrooms in the YMCA. The shower was disgusting and made for midgets. The towels were like cleaning your self in sand paper. After seeing the room we felt it time to leave the room and explore the grounds. The pools were just boring. One pool was filthy, with garbage floating in it. Lovely. Lucky for me they stop giving towels out at the pool at 5 pm so I couldnt go in anyway. They have the nerve to call thier covered lounge chairs cabanas and make you pay extra for that!! The beach on the property has enough sand to maybe fit a 3 people laying out on it, hardly a beach. We decided to use a free drink coupon and head to the Beachcomber bar. Again, the atmosphere reminded me of something out of a 1960's Hawaii television show and was mobbed with 2 other people. I could not even get my free drink becuase I had left my hotel ID card in the room. That's right, they give everyone an ID card, like being at work or in school. Sounds fun huh? The positives are we were able to book the rest of our stay at the Whalers Village down the road.

I couldn't imagine anyone writing a bad review of this beautiful place until I went to get a replacement key for our cottage and an unhappy guest was at the front desk, waiting on the manager. She told me that the Hale wing was right next to where the luau is held every night and that it is impossible to hear anything but banging drums and people shouting. She and her family hadn't slept for two nights and was UPSET. A few nights later, we attended the luau and sure enough, the Hale wing is overlooking the dining area of the luau. And it was loud! I can't imagine having a room right next to this event! What poor planning! Luckily, our cottage was on the far end of the property, where it was VERY dark and VERY quiet.

The grounds around the cottages are very well kept, the service is friendly, and the breakfast buffet every morning was outstanding!! Our room was cleaned everyday with fresh flowers left on the pillows. The bathroom was spacious with a big closet for luggage and a nice deep tub perfect for soaking. Probably our favorite part of the whole trip was being so close to the beach. The southern part of Kaanapali is packed compared to the north part. We actually got married on the beach about 50 feet from our cottage, at sunset and there was maybe 10 people on the entire beach besides us!!

Like most of you, I read all of the recent reviews and took a lot of time in deciding on the Royal Lahaina. We figured that the reality was somewhere in the middle of \"fantastic\" and \"awful\", plus the location can't be beat. We booked a 1 bedroom garden view cottage, so we were able to avoid the noisy remodeling in the tower rooms. Yes, the property is older (built in the 60's), but the rooms provided everything we needed for our week at the beach. The kitchen was stocked with dishes, glassware, coffee pot, microwave, etc. We picked up a few groceries and were set. Our cottage had 2 bathrooms which needed a bit of updating, but were fully functional and clean considering their age. The maid service was great, we left a lot of sand everywhere and not a grain to be found once we returned in the evenings. There were a few little bugs here and there, but I think that the climate is more to blame than the cleanliness of the rooms. All of the windows can be opened with or with out screens, which makes it easy for critters to fly in and out. Our cottage was located on the outskirts of the property right next to the golf course, which are in the process of being fixed up and landscaped. The first morning we woke to the sounds of a tractor at 7am, but that was the only morning we were disturbed. The property is going through major remodeling, and we were told that eventually all of the cottages would be bulldozered and rebuilt from the ground up. That means that the prices will probably double! So, if you're planning a trip with your family, do it in the next year for the better rates. We thought that $350 per night for the extra space and amenities was a great deal. The kids had half the cottage (full size bed, pull-out sofa bed, separate bathroom , TV and kitchen area) and we had our own room with king size bed , tv, bathroom and sitting area (with folding doors to separate the two rooms). You can't beat the location of this resort, just seconds away from one of Maui's most beautiful beaches. The guys at the activities desk at the main pool were very helpful, only pushy selling us stuff on the first day. Once we said no, they basically left us alone. We did book a 4 hour snorkel boat trip, which was one of the best days we spent on our trip. The kids loved the ride over to Honolua Bay for an afternoon of snorkeling and a light lunch. We sailed the entire way back on the sea winds, which was awesome. They picked us up and dropped us off right on the beach, a few mintues walk from the hotel. We only had the breakfast buffet a few times, but enjoyed the spread of hot food, fruits and sweets. There are so many restaurants in the immediate area that other than the luau, we didn't dine at the hotel restaurants at all.

We also had used its luau in the past. Following is our impressions from this hotel: 1- It is quite aging and the value you get is based on how much you manage to pay. The less per room, the better the value! We believe a fair room rate could be around $100/ night. 2- It has been under maintenance that is still ongoing. It is noisy. They even fumigated our room, to kill the bugs, with a short notice. No apologies. You want to ensure your room is not going to be fumigated while there. 3- We decided to get a room in the main tower, as the Royal Hale, a 3-story annex to the hotel, seemed to be noisy each night with the luau activities. It was a good decision, but we had to pay an extra $65/ night to upgrade! We still could hear the drum beats from our main tower room between 8:30 to 9:30 each night. 4-The reception people are generally friendly, but you need to be firm with them, as they provide erroneous information or quote wrong prices unless you notify them. 5-Pools are just pools, nothing fancy. The pool towel attendants are very pushy and aggressive promoting their own scuba diving programs. They dominate the second pool for this purpose. We found this quite annoying & intrusive. Some guests even leave when the pool attendants start their peddling. Their approach is not professional at all. 6- The location is quite convenient to the Whalers' Village- restaurants & shops. 7- Ocean side rooms have fantastic views. 8- Restaurant foods and services are average. You'd find better value elsewhere in Laheina or the Whalers' Village. 9- The luau, claimed to be the best in the islands, is relatively OK, however, expensive. Guests are also annoyed when they see some preferential treatments given to certain groups. Very poor management of the luau event. 10- The room we were in was quite SMALL compared with other hotels in Maui in the same price range.

Stay at the Royal Lahaina so that you can make your trip last longer because, believe these two newlyweds, you'll never want to leave!

We were originally placed in the Royal Hale on the 2nd floor. The room was a disaster. It had mold growing in the bathroom and smelled like it had not been opened in years. We tried to get the hotel to move us but as it happened to be Memorial Day weekend, they were sold out on Friday night. The young manager intern worked with us to move us the following morning. After a miserable night on a mattress with springs poking you in the back and a smell that would rival any men's room at a stadium, Saturday finally rolled around and we were moved into the tower (rm 4014). It was better but certainly not as nice as most Best Western or Holiday Inns. The mattresses were vintage 1982 with springs poking you in the back and low spots that you would get into and have to roll out of. We found roaches in the bathroom late Saturday afternoon after returning from the beach and phoned the front desk. They did not come or return the call. We went down to the desk and left a message for the manager on duty to call us. Again, no call. Finally, on Sunday afternoon, I found the manager on duty and he actually told me that we were in the tropics and there would be roaches. He said that he had roaches in his home and it was unavoidable. He said that he would send someone up to investigate. Needless to say, I was not really happy with the explanation so I sought out the GM and without telling him what had happened, asked him if there were roaches in his home and then when he said \"no, of course not\", told him what had happened. He sent housekeeping up to completely scrub the room from stem to stern, spray and disinfect and to put feather pillow tops on the mattress. He also comped the $16 per day parking/safe/etc \"resort fee\" that was charged for the entire stay as well as breakfast for the last two days. In all fairness, with the pillow tops on the beds, they were comfortable and we did not see anymore bugs during the stay. The ocean view room had a nice view and was high enough to avoid the previously mentioned (by other posters) roof top obstructions that bother the 3rd floor. The hotel is old...very old. It is, however, in the midst of a complete renovation. The plans and the demo rooms are first class. It should be complete by early 2007. The food was very good and prices were certainly fair, especially for Maui. Parking, as has been previously written by many, is very tight and would be suitable for a Mini-Cooper or moped. But the best part, in my opinion, is the beach. It is second to none. Ka'annapali Beach is about as nice a beach as you could find. Even on a holiday weekend, it was uncrowded. Snorkeling was great at Black Rock...saw some turtles and loads of bright tropical fish. The sunsets were as expected. They were breathtaking. For the most part, the hotel staff was polite with the main exception being the front desk folks who were just plain rude. The GM and manager intern were friendly and we had nice visits with them after the problems were worked out. Food and beverage staff were pleasant and professional. The hotel, in it's current form, is a little iffy for me to stay again. However, with the renovations, I would go back in a heartbeat especially with the beach. My advice is to completely avoid the Royal Hale as it is way too much of a crap shoot for a decent room as it is the original hotel built in 1962 and probably not renovated since. The tower is in the process of renovation and construction is going on from 8 am till 4:30 pm. A few days we heard construction as early as 7:00 but such is the price of progress. For the price, it was ok and in all fairness, the management worked, on island time, to remedy the problems that were presented to them. If you stay between now and the end of the year, roll the dice and hopefully you will get lucky.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Clarita, California", "Title": "\u201cWhy the bad rap? I just don't get it.\u201d", "Author": "Skamusic1975", "ReviewID": "UR5288606", "Content": "Like others on tripadvisor.com, I had read some not-so good reviews of the Royal Lahaina Resort prior to actually booking my trip, however; I decided I liked the location of the property and the amenities offered, and the rooms were reasonably priced, so I decided to book my Maui vacation here. We stayed at the Royal Lahaina Resort from May 25 through 28, 2006 and I can honestly say that I cannot understand what the bad reviews are about. Sure, the Royal Lahaina is not the Ritz Carlton (this is not what I was looking for when booking a hotel), nor is it anywhere near the basic accomodation of the Motel 6. On a scale of 1 - 10, I give the Royal Lahaina Resort a solid 8. I am in no way affiliated with the Royal Lahaina Resort. I am simply an insurance field worker who happened to have a wonderful time at this resort. We arrived at the hotel at 9pm after taking the latest flight to OGG that left Los Angeles. The hotel is about a 40 - 45 minute ride from the Airport. When we arrived on the grounds, we found a good amount of parking quite near the luau grounds, which is in walking distance of the lobby/reception area. You need to understand that everything at this resort is within walking distance so even if we had parked in the farthest space away from the hotel, we still would have only been a leisurely 5 minute walk from the main hotel. There are several different accomodations offered at the Royal Lahaina Resort - some of which are in the main high-rise hotel, and others (such as what we had booked) were in the Hale Kanaapali 3-story buildings. Check in at 9pm was a breeze. We checked in, and were offered 2 parking fee options (yes, there is a fee for parking). The choices were either $10 per day for parking only and ala carte pay-per-use in-room coffee, and in-room safe, and no free drinks OR (what we chose) $16.00 per day for parking, 2 Mai Tai's each day in the bar (check out the statute of the monkey climbing the banana), and inclusive in-room coffee and use of the safe. Since 2 Mai-Tai's are $15.50 at the bar, the $16.00 per day sounded like a deal to us, so we took it. I suggest you take this option if you enjoy having a nice evening cocktail and if you (like me) are a caffeine fiend. We received our two keys, the front desk clerk called the bellman, and our luggage was promptly whisked up to our room (literally a 2 minute walk away from receiption.) The reception are is nicely decorated with fresh flowers and has an island theme. Some prior reviews have said that this hotel is \"old\" and \"warn\" however; I had not found that to be the case. The hotel is older, yes, but certainly not \"warn\" by any means. The front desk staff was very nice and not pushy about the $10 or $16 parking fee. As mentioned before, we were in the Hale Kanaapali rooms which are located in the 3-story tower. There are no elevators here, so you really need to be physically mobile in order to reach the 2nd and 3rd floors, however, the stairs are a very easy climb. The rooms are all reached by an indoor corridor and the balconies/verandas face the outside. Our room was 1604 and was classified as a garden view. At 9:30pm at night, we could see nothing outside of our room except some lights and foliage, but when I opened the sliding glass door, I did hear the sound of the ocean. So nice! The rooms are older, yes, but still they are quite comfortable. No bugs, no leaks, everything worked and was very clean. Coffee maker, safe, small fridge, a wetbar, and a couch was in the room along with 1 king bed and your usual TV. The photos that others have posted are a pretty accurate depiction of the Hale rooms. The bed was comfortable, though some might not enjoy the flatter pillows (I happen to sleep with a flat pillow at home, so this was no problem for me.) This room is in a quiet location. When I awoke the next morning, I brewed some coffee (typical standard 2 cup mini-coffee maker with sort of weakish coffee), and opened the door of the balcony. I could hear lots of birds and the rustling of the foliage. I then looked to my left and saw that we actually had a partial view of the ocean. Though this is a garden room, it should actually be classified as a partial-ocean view because that is what it really is. We went down to the buffet for breakfast and had a pretty good meal. Lots of choices from regular bread and jam to an omelette bar. Fresh juices and milk, nice seats inside and outside with views of the pool and the ocean. Good classic buffet breakfast including stronger coffee!! Waitstaff was pleasant and the omelette bar chef was happy to take omelette orders. After breakfast, we decided to check out the beach. We walked by the pool (which in all fairness we never used) and went to the beach which is literally steps away from the pool. The beach is really clean with soft sand, warm water, and great views up and down Kaanapali. 5 minutes walk to the right is a sweet reef where there is some great snorkleing (we saw lots of surgoenfish and unicornfish as well as colorful triggerfish), and 10 minutes walk to your left is the black rock where there is another sweet snorkeling spot. You can rent snorkeling gear at the hotel poolside or you can rent it in town in Lahaina - your choice. The earlier is more convenient, but the latter is much cheaper. The grounds of the Royal Lahaina Resort was well kept, lots of foliage, easy walks, and really close to everything in Kanaapali. There is a free shuttle which will take you from the hotel to most other hotels and Whalers Village - we used it twice. The shuttle is not run by the hotel, but appears to be run by another entity. In any case, it's free and comes about once every 30 - 60 minutes or so. We went to the Luau at the Royal Lahaina as well and had a great time. You should definately spring for an extra $15.00 to reserve premium seating. We were in the first row, center, thanks to Ford who is the Luau Director, and a generally nice guy. You get free drinks in the bar prior to the luau, and all you can drink during the luau. The kalua pig was fantastic - moist & yummy and the grounds were nicely kept. The band was amazing, and the dancers really \"worked it out!\" We actually heard one of the dancers go \"work it out, work it out, work it out\" I thought that was hiilarious! The point is, we were close enough to hear that! The show is well done and goes through Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan and other south pacific dance styles. The fire throwing at the end is amazing and I'm glad we got some video of it. :) To sum it up, we had a great time. We wanted to spend around $150 per night on a hotel, and I feel we got out money's worth. Great location, comfortable room, VERY friendly staff (Lisa at the Front Desk and the other Lisa in Reservations, along with Ford at the Luau). We could have spent $400 per night at the Sheraton Maui, but that is not what we wanted to do. The Royal Lahaina Resort was perfect for us and we will definately go back.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoughton, WI", "Title": "\u201cFinally, a realistic point of view!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5223690", "Content": "For everyone that has read the horrible reviews of this resort, here is an opinion from a 25 year old couple who enjoys having the things money can buy, but also has been camping and knows what it's like to really rough it. We arrived at the Royal Lahaina Resort on May 19th and stayed through May 26th. We were greeted with warm smiles and Aloha's, and had our room upgraded to the Tower (we were booked in the Royal Hale). The room was fine. Nothing bad, nothing great, it was a room. Never did I feel yucky showering or sleeping, and our maid cleaned each day and a couple times we came to the room while she was there so I saw firsthand that she was scrubbing the floor and vacuuming. The food was very good for breakfast and lunch (always had dinners elsewhere). We also very much enjoyed the beach; their pool is a simple rectangle and rather chilly, but we still swam there as well. We did encounter an issue as the renovations are taking place in the tower and our last 3 mornings we definitely heard them. They say the hours are 8:30-4:30, which is no issue but one morning they started at 7AM and we wanted to sleep in. We spoke with a manager about the situation and he offered to move us or do something else to compensate for this issue. It was wonderful! He made the problem seem like a nonissue by making sure we were happy with the solution to the problem. We were very pleased and impressed with the service. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is clean, friendly, and pleasant. The construction may cause a problem for people who like to sleep in late, but if you are in the higher digit rooms, you may be okay (at least from what was happening right now). I don't see where people would feel that they received poor service at this resort, but as the manager brought up when I mentioned Tripadvisor to him, those that don't enjoy their stay are more apt to complain, and often those that are pleased don't say anything. So, we are saying that we enjoyed our stay at the Royal Lahaina Resort and hope that people do not fear the reviews which share the nightmares that only the smallest percentage of people have. Keep in mind, this isn't the Ritz, it is a moderate hotel, worth the value, and utterly enjoyable.", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tracy, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for first-timers\u201d", "Author": "joy126", "ReviewID": "UR5205568", "Content": "My friend and I stayed in Royal Lahaina during the second leg of our Hawaiian Spring Break the last week of March. We found the hotel from Pleasant Holidays which offered us a great package deal from SFO to Oahu and Maui. We are both 22 and 23 year-old female college students. This was my 4th time in Hawaii, but first time in the island of Maui. Airport to Hotel: We purchased transfers through Pleasant Holiday because we didnt wanna risk riding a cab for almost 1 hour drive. We arrived in Maui at 6am Sunday morning and the airport was very empty. The drive from the airport was long and boring. We reached Kaanapali Beach Resorts after about an hour. It looked like a subdivision of beachside hotels. We saw Royal Lahaina not too long after. Check-in: We waited in line for about 5 minutes. We felt very relaxed because the lobby was beautiful and relaxing. The bell-boys immidieately took our luggages from the shuttle and watched them as we proceeded to registration. Check-in wasnt till 4pm but we were at the hotel by 8am. They allowed us to go in our room without hesitation. A golf-cart picked us up in the front of the lobby and drove us to our rooms because walking with luggages to teh room would have been a trek. The driver carried our luggaes in our room and placed them where we wanted them. Hotel: The hotel is beautiful. It is old and it shows its age. There were cottages and a main building. The beach is easily accessed. You could be tanning in less than 2 minutes from the lobby. There were stairs that leads you to the beach. The pool was ok. It wasn't as pretty as other resorts, but who needs a pool when there's the beach 30 feet away? The lobby is beautiful. It's open air so you could smell teh fresh breeze any time of the day. It was also decorated with native arts and the most beautiful arrangement of tropica flowers. The lobby also has Expedia, Pleasant Holidays, etc offices so one could book activities or inquire about their reservations on-site. Room: Our room was located in teh Royal Hale which is the 3 story building away from the main building. Our room door was a sliding glass door, similar to a patio door. It required an actual metal key which gave it an ancient feel. The room was bigger than expected. Plenty of space for 2 women. I think it could accomdate 4+ persons. The beds were big and comfy. The bathroom had PLENTY of space. The closet was big and the counters were very sufficient. The toilet adn shower were separate from the sink and closet. The TV channel selection was good and the furniture was average. There was an additional counter with a sink and a refrigerator. The sofa was dirty so we used it to put our luggage rack. Outside our room was a cute little garden which put us in an \"island\" mood. The access to the beach was 20 feet from our doorstep. very convenient for 2 young women that want to laze in the beach all day. =) Staff: Service was very nice. We got everything we wanted and never complained. They were willing to help and always showered us with compliments. We ate at teh hotel restaurant for one dinner and the manager chatted with us several times. He even offered to let us borrow his car so we could do to the bars outside of teh resort. They were very eager to help us. They were not pushy adn didnt make u feel like you are REQUIRED or OBLIGATED to give them tips. We forgot to tip one time and they didnt get mad/upset. Location: This hotel is good if you want to stay very close to the beach. It was 20 seconds outside of our hotel room. =) If you want a nightlife, this hotel is a bit far from it. It is not walking distance from anything. You would need a car if you want to go outside of the hotel. If you dont plan on doing anything outside and just wants to stay in the hotel, then Royal Lahaina will be perfect for you. It is very quiet and peaceful. You get a sense of privacy and true relaxation without feeling so touristy. This resort also has restaurants and a shopping center, so you could do souveneir shopping here. The beach is beautiful and the best in Maui. You could be tanning and see Molokai in your right and Lanai on the left. The sand is golden and teh water is clear. There's a luau in this hotel so you could attend a luau 5 minutes from your room. Why did I choose this hotel?: My friend and I wanted to relax in Maui since we did our partying in Oahu. We wanted a hotel that was a bit secluded becuase we wanted tranquility. We weren't worried about the proximity to shops becuase we didnt want to be in \"downtown\" area. We just wanted to lay in the sand all day and do nothing. We wanted to enjoy teh resort as opposed to spending our money on activities. I didn't care that the hotel is old because it made us feel like we were home. The fact that it wasnt modern gave it that welcoming feeling becuase it felt more personal. It was as if you were visiting a grandparent. Would I return to this hotel? Most likely, but not anytime soon. This is becuase I want to stay at other areas of Maui as well. I would stay here again when i finish touring the other regions. I would recommend this hotel though because it's a great hotel that would save you money. Pros: value, access to the beach, room size, cleanliness, view, \"hang-loose\" environment, on-site luau. Cons: location far from airport and downtown, too quiet sometimes, too couple-y, pricey restaurant. This hotel is NOT for: - luxury seekers - singles who want to party and mingle in the hotel bars - teenagers who want hotel activities - penny-savers (there are cheaper hotels in less expensive region of Maui) - honeymooners (better more romantic hotels nearby) This hotel is good for: - first time visitors - elderly people - families with young kids - big group - couples (anniversaries, vacation) - the aveage joe and jane - people willing to pay extra to have tranquility. - people who want the convenience of attending a luau without driving. Final words: I loved my stay in this hotel. My friend and I were satisfied and have no complaints. It would have been nice to have an electronic key since I hated carrying and worrying about the key. The hotel is old, but it doesnt really affect your stay. It has an old Hawaii feel becuase it's not very modern. If you like big-city style hotels, stay at the Hyatt or the Westin. We felt very comfortable here. We had an \"upscale\" experience without the snootiness. The hotel felt like home and I would love to visit again in the future. This was my first visit in Maui and I would also recommend this hotel to new Maui visitors since It gives you that true Hawaiian spirit without feeling like a tourist.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cDon't risk staying here.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5147009", "Content": "This hotel is undergoing a very slow renovation.

Once he opened the panel, a huge puddle of water splashed throughout the tiny bathroom leaving the floor wet.

Our travel agent highly recommended this hotel for us, we were somewhat unsure of Maui when we were told it was for the newlywed- or nearly dead, as my husband and I really enjoy nightlife and staying up late drinking and dancing. We took her word for it and requested 1 week in Maui and 1 week in Waikiki to suit our night-owl needs, thinking by the time we left Maui we would be so bored we would hit every nightclub there. To our extreme suprise....we arrived in Waikiki almost in tears that we had to leave the beautiful Island of Maui and have since dreamed of the oppertunity of returning...even possibly owning property there. The Royal Lahaina resort was perfect for us, and it actually made us learn more about each other, we were asleep every night at 11pm and feel asleep in our oceanfront room listening to the crashing waves and the muffled music from the fantastic Luau. After 2 days of being at the Royal Lahaina and realizing that it had captured our heart, we decided to renew our vows (after 4 days of marriage) and get married on the Royal lahaina beach at sunset. Not only was the food, ambiance and Island amazing, but the wedding coordinating services and the friendly staff were unquestionably one of the most impressionable aspects of our trip, we will not hesitate to stay at this hotel during our next visit. It remains to be in our heart.....and we didn't go to any nightclub, we would wake up at 8:30am, have a romantic amazing breakfast poolside, buy a magazine at the corner store in the resort and lay on the beach until dinner time, Lahaina's Front street is a 5 minute drive away from the resort, and we would explore it every second night, a new restaurant, a new collectibles store, a new Mai-Tai.

We then went to Wailea(it has a calmer vibe)to sit by the pool and get massages. The R. Lahaina is located on the Best Beach in Maui, Kaanapali. The beach and grounds are just Amazing. The hotel is on the older quieter side of the beach, but has some of the best beach property in Lahaina. To be right on this beach for less than $200 a night is a steal. Having said that, there is a reason that all of the other hotels on the same beach are double to triple the cost. If you are someone who likes to spend a lot of time in your hotel room, this hotel is not for you. It is not a SPA hotel. Our room was cleaned every day but the rooms are very old and no amount of cleaning will fix that. The showers reminded me of my old dorm. You can't have it all. A Superlow price, be on the best beach in Maui AND have a super modern room! It is a trade off. What is most important to you? With the money we saved we were able to do and see so much, we were busy every day. The hotel rooms were what I kind of expected for the budget price.

The next day we hired a car (USD$65) and drove back to the volcano to do the ATV rides (none of the ATV companies pick up from Lahaina, which is a shame) , also a great 1/2 day.", "Date": "February 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cJust the facts\u201d", "Author": "laza999", "ReviewID": "UR4418451", "Content": "I am writing this piece based on fact and not on emotion so that readers get a good idea of this resort.

Avoid the in town stores as they advertise $1.50/day but once you get there you realise they have tricked you into getting the same thing as the resorts for $8.5/day.

This hotel is what you make of it. If you are expecting perfection and will complain about every chip in the paint or spot on the rug, and want to be waited on like royalty, then this place is not for you. But if you came to Hawaii to enjoy the surrounding beauty and want a place to stay that is close to everything and on the doorstep of one of the nicest beaches in Maui, then this is your place. I travel a lot for business and stay in 4 and 5 star hotels all the time. And the Royal Lahaina is definitely not a 4 or 5 star hotel. This hotel was probably built 25-30 years ago and has not been updated much since then. But it does have the old Hawaii feel that so many of the new resorts lack. And it is clean and functional. Staff is friendly and helpful when we needed it (which wasn't much). The hotel is a bit run-down in some areas of the interior as you would expect from a hotel of this age. But you get what you pay for and the Royal Lahaina is one of the least expensive hotels in Kaanapali. The cheapest rooms with no view at the Hyatt, Sheraton or Westin were twice the price of what I paid here for a beautiful ocean view. We stayed on the 12th floor of the main tower (Kai) and our room was fine. It was dated, and I would guess was at least 20 years old but it was clean and functional and the view was incredible. Its one of the best views you'll get anywhere in Kaanapali and what little time we spent in our room was spent gazing out at the blue ocean, Kaanapali beach and Lanai and Molokai in the distance. It was whale season and we saw whales swimming a few hundred yards off-shore every single day. I can't comment on the rooms in the Hale building or the cottages other than to say that the grounds around the cottages are absolutely beautiful. I have been to Hawaii over a dozen times including Maui, Kauai, Oahu and the Big Island, and I think Kaanapali beach is probably the best beach in Hawaii to stay at if you are looking for perfect weather, a long sandy beach with waves that kids can swim in, and an interesting town nearby (Lahaina). And the Royal Lahaina is positioned right on the best part of this beach away from the crowds you'll find near the Sheraton or Hyatt. The Royal Lahaina has two good-sized pools. Both are right next to the beach as well making for easy access there. Again, these are basic pools, not the huge 2 acre pools with slides and winding pathways that you'll find at the big resorts. But the way I look at it, if you are going to just sit by the pool, go to Vegas or Phoenix instead. Hawaii offers so much more but many people never want to leave their resort. We didn't eat at the hotel and in general I avoid hotel restaurants at all costs because they are universally bad, even at the big resorts. For the money, this is a great place to stay and is in a fantastic location. We had a great time there.

We received no information about check-in or check-out times. Granted, we could have looked it up on the internet, but the advance information was nil. We arrived at the hotel at 1 p.m. to check in, and were asked if we would like a single king-sized bed or two queen beds. We opted for the two queen beds, and were told we would have an ocean-view room with two queen beds. Check-in time was 3 p.m.. We were told we could leave our luggage and return *any time* after 3 to pick up the room keys, which were then set aside for us. We were also informed that parking was $10.00 per day, but the \"package\" included a couple of free drinks at the bar on the property. We went to the hotel restaurant for lunch, and paid almost $60 for the one meal - and it was nothing more than simple salads and iced tea. We then went driving around the island and returned shortly before 5. We were taken to a separate building which was a 3-storey walkup, to a room with one king bed and a view of the back yard and some trees. The room was not clean and actually looked extremely run down. When we asked why the room had been changed, there was no response. We were given, in the end, a partial ocean view room with two double beds, but still on the grungy side, and mould growing in the bathroom. It was quite evident that the room we had been given originally (in the anniversary 'package') had been given to someone else. This is, unfortunately, dishonest. Breakfast was by lineup, and was $12.50 per person. By comparison, we were able to get a breakfast in the town of Lahaina for $9 apiece. That same evening we had dinner in Kahului for $32 altogether. We also had an excellent dinner in the town of Lahaina, with a view of the ocean and exceptional service. In the end, we only ate one meal in three days at the hotel. The day we left, we went into Lahaina and bought our own food at the Safeway store. We came away feeling as if the resort was simply out to make money any way possible, and that they really did not care about the guests. Not only that, but in the three days we only once found a parking spot in the hotel guests lot. The rest of the time we had to go to the overflow lot. Ordinarily I wouldn't mind that if it were simply free for all - but when they charge for parking, there should be space available. The only plus to this resort is the wonderful beach, the beautiful sand and incredible water. There is some undertow, and the drop-off is fairly sudden, so it's not always safe at all points of the beach for small children or those who are not strong swimmers. One of the staff told us this hotel is going to be renovated within the next year. It needs it. On its own, the hotel does have a certain old charm, and had we been treated with more respect and honesty, we probably would have overlooked the age and wear. I cannot help but compare with the Beachcomber Hotel where we stay in Waikiki - also one of the oldest resort hotels in Hawaii. We've been there three times now, always get good deals in Canadian dollars, and free parking. They remember us and take care to ensure we enjoy our stay. The food is good and not wildly expensive. I don't intend to go back to this hotel again. We booked through FunSun Vacations in Canada.

After a shaky start in which the safe didn't work, the lamp needed a new bulb, and the air conditioning unit didn't seem to be working, I initially thought that I would never be able to recommend this hotel. However, a lady in the elevator told me that things would get better as our holiday progressed, and she was, indeed, correct. The problems were addressed in a timely manner, the front desk was very courteous, and by the second day, all my concerns seemed to melt away. First of all, this hotel is an older property, as others have said. But \"older\" doesn't always mean \"bad.\" It does lack the decor/service/ ammenities of the high-end resorts, but it's also not $500+ a night. It is definately not the Ritz or the Four Seasons, but it does have its own kind of charm: lots of old wood, a small, intimate atmosphere, a very close, convenient walk to the gorgeous, spacious beach, a great location in West Maui. I have stayed at four-star resorts and I have stayed at Holiday Inns. If you love the mammoth, cookie-cutter hotel chains (which have their own advantages, of course, but not always a lot of character) this is probably not the place for you. If you are only used to Holiday Inn-like accomodations, this will be an upgrade and you will be happy.

At first sight, the property and hotel entrance looked like a really nice place to stay. However, that image quickly changes once you are taken into your actual hotel room. My first clue that this \"resort\" was not what I bargained for was when the front desk handed me two gold keys to grant access to our rooms. Yes, that's right - two KEYS - not a slim electronic card, but actual keys, along with a note that you will be charged $20 if you misplace a key. The room we were given on the 9th floor (deluxe oceanview), was very outdated. We were given two full size beds since they were all out of king beds, which were very uncomfortable. The size of the bathroom was adequate, but the shower was in need of some repair - not to mention a longer shower curtain. The airconditioning unit allows you three settings, low, medium or high - none of them work really well. However, you do get a great breeze from the Lanai. Also, this resort offers a luau that we did not atttened. One of the hotel employees encouraged us to go to the Old Lahaina Luau, which we did and it was wonderful, and several other employees mocked the resort property. As the old saying goes, \"you know it's bad when.........\" Pros: Right on Kaanapali beach and a short drive to Lahaina. The grounds of this resort are beautiful and make up for the unattractive and outdated rooms. Cons: The quality of the rooms and parking. You are charged $10/day for parking in spaces so small that even a compact car has dificulty squeezing into. You are also charged for using the safe and the coffee maker unless your buy their \"value package\" that is $16/day (includes parking, coffee, use of the safe and 2 mai tai's a day). Bottom line: Stay here if you can get this place for a bargain of a price (we paid $105/night through Priceline).

We went back to the front desk and told them we were disappointed with the room. The guy at the front desk was not very helpful so we asked for a manager and he was very cooperative. He wasn't able to move us that night but he moved us to the main tower first thing the next morning. The rooms in the main tower are alot nicer than the Hale building. I was trying to be optimistic about the Hale building but the reviews are right, just pay the extra to stay in the main tower, you'll be much happier. The view from our new room was what we expected, beautful! The rooms were nothing spectacular but they were nice for the price. The beach here was nice too. It was a lot more crowded down the way. I have never been to a Luau before so I don't really have anything to compare it to but for the price, I thought it was good. The food was really good. As far as the parking spaces, yes they are small but all of the parking spaces were small (here, Front Street parking lots, other restaurants, etc.). Most of the complaints seem to be with the Hale building and the cottages. For the price, the main tower was nice. They do charge for parking, coffee and use of the safe but when we arrived they had three signs sitting on the front desk showing you the prices and they also showed it as a value package -- 2 free Mai Tais daily, parking, safe and coffee.

Upon our arrival, the grounds appeared quite beautiful, but contained scattered \"cottages\" in addition to the main hotel. We quickly learned the hotel did not offer valet service and that we would be forced to self-park in a lot with the smallest parking stalls I have ever seen (I almost had to climb out the window to exit, I'm only 165 lbs). Our rental car was hit in the lot on the second night of our stay, obviously by a Luau reveler who was leaving and could not navigate the small spaces. Our room was in one of the scattered cottages (5-plex), far from the beach. Due to a lack of privacy, we kept our slider door curtains closed the entire time and were unable to open the wooden tongue and groove shutters because they served as both a window and a shade (opening them let in the hot air). Since the fluorescent type lighting in the room did not work intermittently, the lack of outside light was annoying. The shutters also did not block outside noises (see below). The room was very outdated and contained the following amenities: stained carpet, broken tiles in bathroom, black mold in grout, chipped ceiling paint hanging down, dryrot in baseboard in bathroom, portable wall unit A/C (e.g. Motel 6) that was very noisy and did not adequately cool the room, glass closet door sliders that fell off the tracks on first try, etc. Sleeping past 5 am was made impossible, first by sprinklers, then by birds, then by mowers and trimming (all before 7 am). There was only one ice machine for all the cottages, about 400 feet away near the main hotel. The hotel tacked on various petty charges that are not inherent in a quality resort (i.e. $3.50 for use of in-room coffee, $3.75 for use of safe, etc.). We were unable to order pool side food to watch the 6:30 p.m. sunset without going inside and ordering \"to go\", luckily we asked because the pool waitress advised we couldn't get any food by the pool at that time, and certainly did not offer to obtain it for us. The food was adequate, but nothing more. On our last morning, a very large cockroach ran from under the bed and had to be pursued and terminated. I have pictures but have not had time to download them yet. Certainly, my wife and I did not expect the Ritz Carleton.

When we decided to return to Maui I did not even consider another hotel since we were totally satisfied with our first stay. After I booked is when I started reading reviews of the hotel (the internet was not that big when we went the first time). I must say that I was surprised with what I was reading!? How could people find this VERY Hawaiian Resort to be \"kitchy\"? I can only say that most of the bad reviews are from \"seasoned\" travelers that are used to $300 per night rooms that were looking for cheaper digs on Maui or had one bad experience that they let ruin the whole stay. Our room was neat, clean, no mold or bugs. Beautiful view of the ocean. The north side of black rock (where the RL is) is uncrowded and pristine. We did take a jaunt around the south end by Whalers Village and found it to be too much like Waikiki (commercial). The $16 charge per day was worth it for us for the safe and coffee (although I think that no one ever checked the parking pass). It also gets you a free Mai Tai at the Beachcomer every night. Be sure and ask for more Mai than Tai (and drop a few bucks in his jar). Every night you could find good conversation there (trust me - he knows where to stay away from and where to find the good places to eat). If you don't drink coffee or use the safe it may not be worth the money. HINT - ALL the parking spots on Maui are SMALL! Not just at the Royal Lahaina. I parked many times during the Luau and never had to wait for a space to open. The walk is no longer than parking at Walmart when they are busy. Never took us more that 5 minutes from parking to room. We don't spend much time in the room when we travel so I don't put much stock in the carpet and ceiling (we had no complaints). My ONLY complaint was the TV only got 17 stations (they do have many pay for view movies). The grounds are beautiful and kept up. Pools are nothing special but we always paid the $35 to rent a cabana for the day to be by the beach. The staff was attentive to everything we asked for (more pillows, extra coffee, room turn downs, safe fixing for no charge (because I was stupid the first day and forgot the password)). We never met a rude employee during our stay. Free beach towels and friendly pool staff. Great snorkling at black rock. Lots to do and see - WAY TOO much to list here. Feel free to email and ask about my recommendations of Hana, Haleakala, Io Valley, Antiques, Gardens (Enchanted Gardens is a MUST if you like local flora) ... Anyway - we loved it! For $100/night (we booked a package - air/car/hotel) you can't go wrong.

We checked out the Sheraton, Marriot and Westin on Kaanapali while we were there. The Royal Lahaina for the price and atmosphere was the BEST! It has the best beach for families and not crowded like south Kaanapali. My 6 yr old and 9 yr old loved to boogie board, build sand castles, snorkel there and then walk over to the front of the Sheraton to snorkel at Black Rock. Whalers Village shopping has a food court for cheaper meals and great shops. Love the ABC stores! Safeway has a great roast chicken and accessories if you are like us and cant eat out for every meal as it gets to be tough on the digestive system and kids want snacks on the room. If you want lots of surf to boogie board, the Ritz Carlton beach - DT Fleming was great, they have a lifeguard but the tides/current can get nasty. Be careful. We stayed in the tower on the top floor, 12th, had no problems...even the room staff gave us extra coffee, towels, cups, etc. We had no problems when we needed the security personnel to come fix the in-room safe after our ds messed with it. Got there within minutes! The room was clean, newer in decor (beds were a dble not queen size) but the view on the lanai and from the room was FANTASTIC! Recommend the extra $ for the parking fee, daily 2 Mai Tais (from Don the Beachcomber bar), fridge and in room safe. All hotels seem to charge for this. We ate 3 dinners, 2 breakfasts and 2 lunches in the dining room. The early bird dinner special and the surf and turf special -recommend! Kids ate for FREE! Wait staff was friendly and fast. The ice cream shop was nice and the laua was just OK. Preferred Germaine's over on Oahu but our kids loved the fire eater/dancer finale. Buy your tickets from Expedia there in the lobby - cheaper and kids are free...give yourself a few days tho. The Royal Lahaina have the lighting of the tiki torches ceremony at dusk around the first pool and live hawaiian musicians in the dining room every night. Fabulous to listen to and watch the sunset from your dinner table over the ocean beach!

The resort has great grounds, a super beach but it is really dated. I don't think the owners are putting their money back into the hotel. We stayed in one of the cottages, and it was filthy. The couch looked like something from a fraternity house, the walls were so dirty they didn't even wipe clean when I tried. The carpet was worn and dirty. Basically there was old dirt and dust everywhere. The washing machines had mold growing in them. I couldn't imagine being there on my honeymoon in that filth. The front desk acted like they have never run a hotel bill before and got our families all screwed up and even double billed us. Here is another tip, find out how many people are able to attend the luau. We were told there were 500 people there...you could hardly pull your chair out to sit or stand, and I woudn't recommend the dancers either they were very canned and looked bored to death.

We read these reviews for a month before our trip and we realy didn't know what to expect or who to believe. Well, take it from two fussy travelers, the grounds are breathtaking and well kept, the location is first class and our room (9011) in the Kai Tower was furnished with a King size bed and the bedding looked brand new! The room was extremely clean and the friendly maid service kept it that way. Nothing in the room was in need of repair, there were no \"musty odors\" or any \"insect sightings\" as mentioned in some previous reviews. But, I would suggest not getting a room in the Hale Building, as it did look old from the outside. This building looks nothing like the rest of the resort. Maybe staying there was the reason for some bad reviews. If staying in the Kai Tower ask for an odd numbered room because the view of the West Maui mountains, golf course, resort's cottages and of course the ocean, is spectacular! If you get an even numbered room your view will be obstructed unless you're above the 9th floor. The Luau show and food was great! The beach is clean and the beach activity staff was there to help you with whatever water activity you desired-also in supplying you with towels. Yes, you have to pay $10 per day for parking, just like any other resort on the island. But, for $16 you get parking, the use of the in-room safe, coffee and coffee pot, local telephone calls and 2 Mai-Tai's daily (at the bar $7.50 each)! You can't beat it! OK, the parking spaces are a little tight, but I parked my mid-sized car with no problem. The \"Breakfast Buffet\" was well worth $14.95 if you like fresh fruit, omlets made to order, fresh pastery, juice, coffee, scrambeled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, waffles, pancackes, and many, many more items. The Basil Tomatoe restaurant is a little pricey, but serves delicious pasta dishes! If you like golf or tenneis, you'll find it at this resort. There are 3 pools. One of which is secluded and is located by the tennis courts. There are many shops on the grounds to care for your various needs, even a laundry. The elevatores and hallways were a little warm but, you weren't in them for long. The staff was pleasant, helpfull and full of \"Aloha\" spirit. If you're looking for excursions to go on try the Atlantis submarine, the Maui Princess Dinner cruise, and the Ulalena show all out of Lahaina. Go on the \"Road to Hana\" and go see the view at the summit of Haleakala. It is breathtaking. Although, I wouldn't suggest the bicycle ride down. We would definitely return to this resort again!

They are quick to serve drinks but they are Weak with a capital W! The biggest disappointment of all is the food. The pork was way too salty, the turkey was dry, and the fish had all its flavor cooked away. The steak was so chewey and hard to cut that we gave up trying to eat it. The side dishes such as the fried rice and noodles were nothing special but was the only thing we could eat since the featured food was so bad. Normally we are not finicky eaters so this was not a case of us expecting high level food... we knew we were dealing with buffet food and yet it bordered on being uneatable. Well how about the desert? They can't screw that up, can they. Yep, they can! The chocolate cake had a chemical preservative flavor to it... like the prepackaged cakes at a store. The coconut cake was better but nothing special. Then the show begins. The show is OK... we were entertained by it and the firedance at the end was good too. The show won't knock your socks off but it will keep you entertained. Since this was the 1st time for a luau for us, we have nothing to compare the entertainment to so its possible the other luaus are better for this.

We loved it! I was really skeptical after reading the reviews but I found none of the horrible things people complained about. When we arrived the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, the bellboy was friendly and gave us all kinds of info. The lobby area was very authentic, which I enjoyed, being in Hawaii. We stayed in the Alii Suite on the 8th floor. It was totally clean, no bugs, the carpet wasn't gross. It was huge, almost as big as our apartment. The bathroom was nice, the walk-in closet huge with lots of space. Yes, the rooms are a little dated, not the furniture or decor, but just like in an older home, there are things that are worn and peely, but it wasn't gross at all. We weren't afraid to be in the shower, although the shower door didn't shut completely, it didn't leak. The tub was really nice. Housekeeping came everyday and made everything clean and fresh. Nightly turn down service with orchids on our bed was beautiful and fun. We got our champagne the second day, as we arrived late the night before. Housekeeping was also very quick to bring up anything extra we needed (like towels). We got our morning paper everyday. The view from the suite is amazing as you have 3 balconies. We could see everything. Parking was never a problem for us, even during the luau. They have areas of the parking lot sectioned off, just for hotel guests that people attending the luau can't park in. No, you may not get front row parking and people do park crooked, but it was never an issue for us, even in a jeep grand cherokee. The food was really good. So many people on here have complained about the breakfast, they must be crazy. We were in breakfast heaven every morning. The food was warm, delicious and the variety was awesome! We made it to breakfast between 6:30-7:30 everyday and it was never crowded. One morning we got there at 8 and it was getting crowded, but the food was still wonderful. We are now really missing breakfast there. Try the waffles with the coconut syrup...mmmmm! The lounge had really good food too, we had the Kahuna salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever had. We ordered room service one night, ribs and a burger, both were really good. The only place we didn't like the food was the Tomatos Basil resterant on the property. It was overpriced and nasty. We'd never seen so much fat on filet mignon. The lady at the concierge was a little ditsy, be sure to get confirmations for anything you book through her. Aunty Lei at the activities desk was pretty helpful, booked us on a great kayaking trip. It was through Kellys Kayaking and it was awesome. The snorkeling trip to molokini and turtle town she booked wasn't very good... so just don't book on anything with more than 40-50 people and don't book on the Prince Kuhio. It was overcrowded with bad service and bad equipment. The beach off this hotel is amazing! It's never crowded, we went at all times of the day. It's warm, no real waves, there is stuff to see snorkeling right off the beach. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful. The sunset dinner sail was so much fun, it pulled right up to the beach and there were dolphins everywhere. The luau was great. The luau food was delicious, especially the pig, but everything was so good. We had a wonderful wonderful time at this hotel and we will definitely come back. I want to come back with kids and extended family in the future. Booking the suite was well worth it, for approx $500 a nite we got the suite with amazing views, a jeep grand cherokee, breakfast every morning, a dinner cruise and tickets to the luau. It was well worth every penny. You can't get a garden view room at one of the big hotels for that. Ignore anything bad anyone says, stay in a decent room and you'll have a great time. We met several people while we were there and everyone loved it, even those that were staying in the cottages.

The resort is located in Ka'anapali, *the* premiere location on Maui. The grounds of the resort are large and well-manicured, bordered by the beach on one side and a golf course on another. The place boasts a number of restaurants and little shops which we thought enhanced the resort, but only aesthetically. You will probably find the shops and restaurants on the grounds to be overpriced with mediocre fare and borderline service (of course, this is Maui so everything moves a little slower). Some things we discovered during our stay: - This is a particularly good resort if you're on your honeymoon or anniversary. You'll get a free upgrade based on availability - in our case we moved from the older Royal Hale building to the newer, nicer tower. Our first night we were in a smaller corner room with non-functional A/C. In the morning we asked to move and were quickly accomodated. If you're not staying for a honeymoon/anniversary you may find that the hotel is overpriced. This is especially true if you're bringing your family, since some of the rooms run on the small side. - The activities desk in the lobby is actually helpful and offers good prices. The Royal Lahaina luau prices at $77 on the resort's website, but the Expedia desk can get you tickets for $58. - Speaking of the luau, although we really enjoyed the experience, the event happens EVERY NIGHT. If you're coming from the mainland, be prepared for banging drums, clapping, and shouting until 9:30 local time (which will be 3:30 AM for you East Coasters). Also, the wind can be loud on the upper floors of the tower. The rooms with the partial ocean view will get the full brunt of the noise - the garden view rooms will be much quieter. - The hotel is a little older so be prepared for some minor quirks. Whenever our neighbors showered (at 5AM), the pipes squeaked and groaned. The A/C may or may not work. Also, the elevators are notoriously slow and some of the doors in the rooms may stick. We found this to be minor inconveniences, though - this is what made the difference between a four- and five-star review in our minds. - As mentioned above, the hotel's restaurants aren't all that great, but there are some cool places to eat nearby. CJ's Deli is within walking distance and if you have a car be sure to check out the Plantation House in Napili. It's about a 15 minute drive and offers a great view, great food, with a great price. Also, the Honolua Store in Kapalua (right next to the Ritz Carlton) has a really good take-out breakfast for under $5. - When checking out, you'll have access to a hospitality room where you can shower and freshen up before heading out.

The pool was a few short steps up from the beach. We had the most relaxing days renting a beach bungalow for two and taking in the beautiful ocean views and air. Whenever it got hot I could wade into the pool, or if I needed a drink or snack I could walk back to my cottage 2 minutes away. The convenience was wonderful. The housekeeping and grounds staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay special. There are coffee machines in the room with Kona (Yum!) coffee for guests. The maid quickly found out I was a coffee drinker and always made sure I had a good supply. The grounds were lovely with plumeria trees all around. I loved being surrounded by flowers. The air smelled thick and sweet. The breakfast buffet was very good and was a nice way to begin the day. The restaurant also served very good dinner selections. I was always impressed with the Chef's Fish of the Evening preparations. There were also (free) cocktail parties once a week with very nice appetizers and drinks served. It was nice to listen to the live music and mingle with some wonderful people. All in all we were very happy with our choice to stay at The Royal Lahaina. We would stay there again. My one recommendation would be to upgrade to a seaside cottage. Waking up to the gorgeous Hawaiian sunrise right outside your sliding glass door is an experience to be savored. The sunset was equally as amazing. My huband and I would take seaside strolls and then just walk back up to our cottage.

Before the big hotels moved in during the eighties, Royal Lahaina was luxury at it's finest, but it shows it's age. It looks like the hotel industry on Maui is moving closer to having a timeshare model of hotels rather than a full service resort like Royal Lahaina. I suppose this will decrease costs for the owners while optimizing occupancy. The Royal is following suit with this trend. We stayed in the L cottage in the middle of what could be considered three rows of buildings. The first is beach/pool front, the last is golf course boundary for the Kaanapali golf course. I thought that the room was not in need of complete repair but could use some TLC. I was thrilled with it's proximity to the beach and restaurant and it's privacy. Having a private patio was awesome. The renovations are scheduled to start in October. They will remove the cottage system at Royal Lahaina and put in timeshare based hotel property. With the destruction of the cottage system, another piece of the island feeling will be lost. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The trees are mature and healthy. The staff at the front desk and bell service were incredible. I had to watch them deal with customers that would have put me over the edge for such outlandish requests. They did this with professionalism. The guys at the pool were great and very helpful. I did not like the restaurant staff. The hostess was not friendly and the servers were unfriendly too, (except for auntie B). The bartender was on top of it also and he was a local boy. The complaints about the parking lot are valid as it always seemed full. We had to park behind the tennis stadium on most occasions so I was dropping my family off then parking which was a bummer. So hurry up if you want a very reasonably priced vacation spot in a cottage setting. They will be gone soon. A couple of things to note are that the $99 dollar meal deal is discontinued, the parking fees were either 9 or 13 dollars, they have moved to 10 or 16 dollars depending on your plan.

Which is good for all of us. Parking is the main problem, spaces are small and some do not know how to park. lol But you find that at home also. If you are friendly the staff is friendly and dont be afraid to ask for anything. Eat a breakfast ($15) buffet and royal deal is ($8.50). and lots of other places close by if you do not like the resort. Eat a good breakfast and light lunch if needed and out at night. There are lots of places close to eat that are the same price at home. Best place is to go to the beaches watch the sunsets and cook fish, shrimp or whatever you want. Always a park close by with charcoal pits. Take a helicopter tour, well worth the trip, at least Air Maui tour was of West Maui and Moloki Ocean Cliffs 1 hour long. Take the Teralani 2 Sunset Cruise or Dinner Cruise. Also they have snorkel Sails also. The cottages will be gone in two years and three story condos will be in their place. Remember you are on vacation and do not let anything or anyone ruin it for you. Enjoy. We truly enjoyed the Royal Lahaina Resort Cottages and Maui. Most of all enjoy the Island and it will enjoy you. Lots of different beaches to go to not by the Resorts. Big Beach and Litttle Beach are both wonderful. And lots of beaches on the East Side by he Airport not used by tourists. Good for fun and barbaques. Lots of resonable golf courses, the best is Waiehu Municipal Golf Course. It has more holes by the ocean than any course on Maui. $26, cart $8.50 rent clubs for $25. Buy some balls, tees at Kmart or Costco on Maui. Bring your own glove and save lugging your clubs along. If it is windy, you will not experience any course like it on the mainland.

I stayed here back in 1988 and 1998, true not much has changed, the last reno was in 1996 and that's why I love this place! Not at all stuffy, usually I stay at the FS and Park Hyatt's when traveling to cities like NYC, Melbourne, Sydney and London but in Hawaii, who needs all of that flash really? A beach is a beach and I like to be able to wore a t-shirt and my shorts for breakfast without having to feel underdressed. All of the negative reviews must be from travellers that aren't well travelled because I have stayed at the FS in Waliea and of course that experience is always excellent put your also paying much much more. This Royal Lahaina isn't flashy, but warm and welcoming, laid back and relaxed. Its is a great property located on right on Kaanapali Beach's quieter side away from the big resorts and the crowds. The resort, while not as new and updated as some of the other more expensive resorts in Kaanapali, is much quieter and more relaxed and has a more laid back atmosphere and no crowds, you really feel like your in Hawaii. The rooms are simple and clean and house keeping did a really good job everyday of restocking towels etc. We had an ocean view room on the 9th floor with a great view of the ocean and mountains, but we barely spent time in our room. Try to get a room above the 8th floor, better views!!! The breakfast buffet, $14.95US per person was a good value with lots of choices, my personal favorite was the waffle station! For $8.50US you could get the \"Royal Deal\" which includes everything on the buffet expect hot items which is good for those days you don't feel that hungry. All of the other meals and drinks that we had were great and were a good valu. Sadly their $99 meal deal is no longer avaliable, it ended the day after we came, but the prices for food and beverage are VERY good considering what you pay at other nearby resorts The best thing was there were no crowds, even in the middle of the day there were lots of lawn chairs and you could always find a place to relax on grass. There were two pools and the Beach Activities desk was great and always had towels when we needed them. We can rent snorkels and boggie boards, I rented one for $35 for the week, otherwise its $15 for one hour, we were there for a week so the $35 weekly rental is a good value. There's a convenience store located on the property which is really handy when you need to grab some sunscreen or a drink and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like driving to an ABC Store. There is a free shuttle service to Whalers Village that leaves right infront of the hotel and this great if you don't feel like walking over, it's only a 10-15mins walk to the Whalers Village from the resort. Only down side was being charged $9 a day for parking and it was hard to find a spot some nights. The resort has tennis courts and a great luau as well. For those that need to check their email there is an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 located just beside the lobby area $3 for 10mins or if you have your laptop with wireless, it's $15 for the day or $35 for the week, not to bad I think for us that need stay connected with the office while on holidays. The best part of the experience was the staff. They were always friendly and helpful and really made us feel welcome. An example, on St. Patrick's day we were having drinks in the bar and our server brought over some St. Patrick's Day themed cookies, as my name is Patrick, thought this was a nice and geniune touch! This hotel is getting a bit dated, but it's got more Hawaii character then most of the new resorts in Kaanapali and NO nasty RESORT FEE! This resort is sadly going to be turned in a 5 star property, a real shame. I agree they MUST renovate asap, but they should keep the laid back atmosphere, it will be shame to lose this resort to yet more commercialization of the the true Hawaiian experience.", "Date": "March 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kailua, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Lahaina is home away from home on Maui\u201d", "Author": "jipc", "ReviewID": "UR3294743", "Content": "I am a Hawaii resident and live on Oahu.

I had read the reviews and was quite worried about what to expect. The grounds are beautiful but the room in the hotel was definitely dated. It was always clean and did not smell any mold but needs updating and painting and the linens (bed spread)are very old. It had a shower only with a small bathtub. We had registered with Shiloh Inns who now owns the property and got a member number which entitles you to an upgrade if it is available. So when we were checking in, I asked if there was an available upgrade. The guy checking us in then gave us to another lady who gave us a partial ocean view on the 9th floor, facing the golf course. Neither of these people were welcoming or gave us a smile. The guy getting the luggage out of the jeep was friendlier than them. I had read about the $9 charge for parking but did not realize how many parking places would be left when the luau was in session. We did not go to the luau but every evening when we got back to the hotel, it was a major search to find a parking place, all of the spaces are very small which makes for a lot of fun when you have to park next to a SUV or van. I had read about the Castaway Restaurant at the Maui Villas so we went there for breakfast most mornings. The first morning, we saw about 20 tail slaps from the whales who were not far from the shore. Food was excellent and very reasonable prices. Staff was friendly and knew our drinks before we left the island. Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina for the coconut shrimp was also very good. Kimo's in Lahaina - had an excellent fish taco. Pools were adequate. Beach is beautiful and not that busy. Did not hear where the jacuzzi was until the night before we left - out by the highway, past the tennis. Used the laundry facilities and worked well except for some loud noises which eventually went away. The shops were quite nice but again, the people were not that welcoming. The entertainment in the lounge area was not good at all. We had previously stayed at the Kaanapili Beach Hotel and will be going back there in the future when we go back. It is an entirely different feeling from the staff and the hotel. Not to mention the entertainment! KBH has them beat hands down! The extra $20-40 to stay at KBH is money well spent. We went there 2 or 3 nights for the entertainment alone. Overall, the resort needs some money spent on the hotel itself. As I said, the grounds are beautiful and seem to be kept up quite well but for the price, the hotel should be much better. If all you are interested in is a place to sleep and shower without any Hawaiian ambience, then I guess this is the place for you. The \"cottages\" may be much better (did not see them from the inside) but from the outside, they also looked like they needed some updating. Also, when we were checking in, did not check to use the safe in the room but it was charged on our bill. So be sure to check your bill when checking out.

There are very few people using the beach at any given time so it is almost like your own private beach.

Also within walking distance from the Royal Lahaina is Black Rock which is one of the world's foremost snorkeling spots. The food at the resort restaurant was pretty good and not too expensive for Hawaiian standards. We bought a package which offered free breakfast buffet each morning which I would recommend because the buffet costs $12.50.

Royal Lahaina is perfectly adequate for what we needed. The hotel isn't exactly top knotch, but if you're on a budget, and you like to explore and spend more time visiting your vacation destination then your hotel - this is a good place to be. The rooms were clean and simple in the Royal Hale section, nothing fancy. The staff was very friendly, we even received a free room upgrade upon arrival which was a great surprise. The staff responds to friendliness, so if you are rude, don't expect a room upgrade or pleasantness in return. We were pleasant and were treated wonderfully. The luau is every night, and quite loud, if you're going to be in a Royal Hale hotel room around dinnertime you may wish you request another room on the opposite side of the luau, where you still hear it but not nearly as loud. Personally I wasn't bothered by it, although it is basically the same thing everynight so be prepared for some repetative listening. Be aware of the $12/day resort fee, which should just be included in the price. It covers parking, safe, coffee, phone calls. You can opt out, and pay for things individually, its $9/day for parking, $1 for each local call, $1.50 + $0.50 a minute for 800 numbers - silly stuff. The beach is wonderfully beautiful but crowded, about a mile long heading to the north, and a short walk to the south side of Kaanapali beach and blackrock, which is even more crowded but about 2 miles long. Unfortunately there's an awful amount of cigarette butts and litter of pop and beer cans from people who trash the beach. We explored much of the coastline and just about everywhere we saw cigarette butts. If you smoke have some respect, the beach is not an ashtray. Don't throw your garbage around in paradise. Snorkeling is pretty good in front of the new Westin building which is maybe a quarter mile walk north of the Royal Lahaina along the beach. Black rock is also good but on a very crowded stretch of Kaanapali Beach in front of the Sheraton, a short walk south. The waters are a bit cloudy now, and the coral is being smothered from dust and dirt being blown into the ocean from the construction at the Westin, so enjoy it while it lasts. The best snorkeling visibility tends to be in the morning. We saw local police patrol the beach, and police are frequently seen in downtown Lahaina. You may view this as good or bad. High crime, or just extra protective? Who knows, but theft is relatively common, so don't leave valuables in your car when on hiking or exploring trips around the island. I would stay here again. I think the people who are complaining are used to staying in costly resorts, such as Hyatts, Hiltons, Four Seasons, etc. If you want to spend a bunch and get spoiled, go to the south side of the island - Grand Wailea and Four Seasons are extreme luxury. You get what you pay for. If you're on a budget and don't spent every minute at your hotel grounds, this is a good place. Don't expect red carpet treatment, and be prepared for finding cigarette butts as you comb the sand to build sand castles in some areas. The hotel itself was quite busy throughout our stay, many europeans and australians stay here which I see no problem with. You're on vacation, enjoy yourself. Don't let the little things ruin your time. A note if you're on a budget: If you're shopping, try to bargain - many people are quite flexible with prices that otherwise seem outrageous.

Whaler's Village is a shopping district and eating area close by. We even walked a couple times (takes about 20 minutes one way). Very nice walk, you walk right beside beautiful gold course and other hotels on way. They also have a bus that goes to town of Lahaina every hour, this costs $1 per person each way so not too bad. Hotel staff were excellent, very helpful. Laua is on 5 nights a week so a little noisy for us as we were staying right beside it.

We had a woenderful night, met people, entertained etc. Grounds are beautiful, see mountain in a distance, beach is right there, stores right on grounds for late night convenience (sundries, postcards, drinks, sandwiches). Ice cream store had outragious prices, something like $5 for one ice cream cone. Hung out at beach alot, saw a whale in distance. Towels are provided free of charge from the pool guy. Always found a chair to use while at beach/pool area. Lots of birds there not afraid of humans at all. Then rent snorkling stuff and blow up rafts on grounds if interested. (pricy though). One day, someone was snorkling and found a 20 dollar bill in water. They said they saw a hundred dollar bill float by but could not catch it, so nonetheless, a few people went out then and tried to find it, no luck though.

We also traveled to Italy for 10 days in October so budget was a consideration for us for Maui accomodations. I have to admit that previous reviews that I read before our departure last week had me very concerned but once we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. We stayed in room 8001 (on the very corner), located on the southeast corner of the building with a partial ocean view. It was more than what I expected. From our balcony the view overlooked the golf course. Looking to the left we could see the awesome mountains. Looking to the right we could see the beach and Molokai. It was beautiful and we found ourselves often sitting on the balcony looking at the view from all hours of the day and night. The stars at night are so fabulous. No complaints at all about the view. Here's the good and the bad, starting with the bad to keep the reader's suspense down to a minimum (smile). 1) The sliding door separating the shower/toilet from the rest of the bathroom didn't slide. We constantly had to pickup the door (it wasn't heavy at all) and slide it ourselves when privacy was needed. It was an annoyance but we didn't let it ruin our trip. We figured that we got a pretty good room considering some of those described in other reviews so we lived with the situation vs. gambling on a room change and perhaps getting something not as good. 2) Parking spaces are definately small but we could ALWAYS find a place to park, regardless of whether the luau was going on or not. The walk from the parking lot to the hotel isn't as remotely as bad as people are saying. The Royal Lahaina situation was considerable better than some of the parking facilities of the other premium hotels located along Kaanapali. Some of those arrangements required waaay longer walks than RL. Besides, judging by the looks of some of you fatties vacationing in Maui, you can definitely benefit by walking the extra few yards. Guys, that's really it for the bad. The rooms are certainly older compared to modern standards but our's was perfectly comfortable and clean. No smelly elevators, etc. The good? 1) Staff was excellent! We arrived at the resort at about 6 PM. No problems with check-in; it was fast and smooth. Bellman took our luggage from our car and loaded it onto the cart and carried it to our room. All staff treated us very well at all times so I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Here's a fine example: Our Monday return flight didn't leave until 6 PM. The resort's checkout time was at noon. We didn't want to drive around or sit at the airport for several hours waiting for our return flight. What did we do? We called the front desk, explained our situation and asked for a check out time extension. Without hesitation the staff said no problem and granted an extension until 3 PM without any questions asked or additional fees. What would otherwise have been an early check out and long day at the airport ended up being several extra hours on the beach on our final morning. How's that for customer service? 2) The beach was excellent, as were the grounds. 3) Breakfast was very good. Yes, two people for the buffet cost $26 but it's convenient if you're spending a day at the resort's beach. I don't understand what previous reviewer's complaints have been about the breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, pancakes or waffles, toast, cereal, oatmeal, loads of fruit, juices and more. If you can't find something to eat among that tremendous variety then you are one picky S.O.B. Hey, I saw a whole lot of you fatties there and it wouldn't hurt you one bit to not have a perfect breakfast every morning. I only ate lunch once at the poolside restaurant and it was overpriced (which hotel poolside restaurant isn't?) and it wasn't that great but it was edible. For dinner, the only onsite restaurant we ate at was at the Tomato Basil, which was very good. An experienced traveler should have some idea of what vacation's actually cost. If the price seems a little low then you should know you're not getting Marriott-styled accomodations. Some of these people complaining about low ceiling fans, long walks from tight parking spaces, no bathtubs, not getting an extra suitcase stand, etc., should get off their high horses and fork out the extra cash for such amenities. Extra suitcase stands? Shesh - ---? Put your suitcase on the floor! You want premium rooms and swimming pools? Fork out the extra cash and go to the Sheraton or Westin. In return for your investment you'll get superb accomodations. You'll also get hoards of screaming children surrounding you at every turn since those type of resorts especially cater to the family-oriented, activity-filled vacation. After a week of sitting at the pool, at night your ears will be echoing the horrible, reverberating sounds of \"Mommy/Daddy, look!\" or \"Wahhh\" since you've heard it all week. There were very few children at LR. I've never understood why so many people travel thousands of miles to be on a fantastic island only to spend the week sitting at the pool instead of on a beautiful beach but to each, his own. If ultra chic swimming pools and fabulously premium rooms are a high priority for your vacation experience then you could save yourself a heck of a lot of money by going to Las Vegas. The rooms and pools there are second to none and are cheap, by island vacation standards. My wife and I never vacation at the same place because there's a great big world out there and so little time to see it. But if we did and for the same price, I would definitely return to Royal Lahaina. The money we saved allowed us to eat excellent dinners in town in Lahaina and buy lots of the crap we always buy on vacations - that's half the fun. I'd rather have money in my pocket and a decent place to rest my head at night then stay at a palace with a fine pool. Anyway, thanks for letting me rant, LOL. Hey, bottom line is that Royal Lahaina isn't that bad at all and is an excellent bargain if budget is an issue.

The first time we were in the newest tower (where the main lobby is) and that wasn't too bad. For what the hotel charges per night (beware that they charge $9 a day for parking), it was fine. The room was a little shabby (old furniture, not-so-clean shower), but for the price what can you say. However, during our second stay, we were put in the off-site tower and it was totally disgusting. Since we live in Hawaii, we did not want to upgrade to an ocean view room and decided on a garden view room. When I walked in (Room 1500), I immediately went back to the lobby and complained. Not only was the room disgusting (old bedspread, old carpet, paint peeling off the wall, beat up door, etc.) we had a view of the noisy parking lot. We were promptly given a room down the hall (Room 1510) which was much better, but I still wore my flip flops around the room (afraid to put my bare feet on the floor) and closed my eyes every time I was in the shower (mold, unidentified hairs and a shower curtain that would make you cringe). My husband kept telling me to stop complaining, which made me realize I did get what we paid for. For what little time you spend in your hotel room, it's not a bad hotel. However, if you can afford to splurge a little, I highly encourage it. The good thing about the Royal Lahaina is: it is right on a beautiful beach, it has a free shuttle to Lahaina Town (5 miles down the road), and it makes it affordable to see the beautiful island of Maui for people on a budget.

In particular the Maitre D' for the dining room, Ford Ushiami did a wonderful job looking after us whenever we ate in the dining room.

The truth is that the Royal Lahaina does not compare to the larger resort hotels such the Sheraton, Westin etc. It is in a class of its own offering staff who have been at the hotel for many years. Some even remember the Foxey Lady Disco. The hotel has a real island feel with its bamboo papered walls of its dining room. While we were there, renovations were taking place to continue to improve on the hotel. The facilties are excellent with two pools and a beach that is perfect. The popular Whaler's Village is a 10 minute walk away. This allows the resort to remain a peaceful place away slightly from the crowds. We took advantage on a $99.00 meal plan per person. This offered 7 full buffet breakfasts, 2 dinners and a $50.00 bar tab, excellent value, excellent food and excellent service. The wine list was satisfactory with an excellent house reisling at $15.00 a bottle. The rooms were comfortable.

It's about the same size at the Whaler Village. Parking on Front St. is easy because there's either free parking or validated parking available. The resort is beautifully landscaped, it's just an older structure. We read all these scary reviews before we came out, but we weren't too worried.

But, the management team promptly upgraded us to an Ocean View and then ultimately to an Ocean Front Cottage-which if you decide to stay here-you should DEFINITELY book in one of the ocean front cottages-your vacation will feel much different being just steps from the beach and opening your shades every morning to see a breathtaking view. They also have a wonderful FREE happy hour on Wednesdays hosted by the friendly management staff...they definitely treat you like guests and the food and beverages are served unlimited for 2 hours--its a great deal to get anything FREE these days (and even if its built into the room cost somehow) -it still feels nice not to have to pay for your drinks and PuPus at HH. #2 they definitely are in a prime location. Most of the other high end resorts-such as the Ritz-Grand Wailea-are not directly on the beach-the RLR is just steps (vs. a long stroll on a foot-path) to beautiful Kaanapali beach. You are also a footpath a way from Whalers Village, which has higher-end shopping for West Maui (Tiffany, Coach etc.) and some great restaurants and bars that stay open past 10 pm (beware, if you like staying up at past 10 pm at your hotel bar...you'll be by yourself as this place pretty much shuts down at 10 pm) If you are expecting to get a great deal on a hotel-which their rates at the RLR are- and hope to find yourself surprised with a beautiful room like the Ritz, this isn't your place.

The hotel restaurant is overpriced given the mediocre food; I agree that meals should be eaten elsewhere -- Maui is full of great restaurants. The bar closes at 10:00 -- what's that about?? The pools are plain old rectangles, with no caves, waterfalls or slides. I found the staff helpful and friendly, and the room was clean.

Our private cottage had a private beach which we were excited to use. However, we were disapointed to find the chairs covered in bird poop. After asking the hotel to clean it 3 times, we gave up. Perhaps most disappointing, is that I spent time filling out the feedback card (with both positive and negative feedback) and almost a year later received no response.

The room was decent, but I noticed the bathroom had some mildew in the tiles, and I didn't care for the shower curtain odor. The bathroom doors are the kind that slide, and it was hard to slide back and forth. The carpet and chairs in the room were a bit worn too. If you are not a neat freak than you will probably be less bothered by it. Also if you are a light sleeper that needs absolute, complete silence, the air conditioning makes an annoying humming sound. We tried turning off the air and opening the balcony window, and the waves were very loud too. It seems to be amplified when you are on the ninth floor. The best part about the hotel is the location. The beach is beautiful, and sandy and does not have rocks. Because of the lack of coral and rocks, there are not too many fish swimming around. We took walks along the beach at sunset and in the morning. It was absolutely beautiful and romantic. The service was very responsive and courteous. Every time we requested something to be brought to our room, it took no more than five minutes. The activity counter was very helpful and reliable. I purchased surf lessons at Maui Waveriders through the hotel. I had the best time. If you want to learn to surf, I highly recommend them. The food was not too good at the hotel. We had the breakfast buffet for $13 each, and was not worth it. My husband compared it to camp food. We ate dinner at the restaurant downstairs once and it was only so so.

Fortunately, we spent little time in the room so it was not a big issue. We simply opened the sliding doors to air it out each time we came in. The shower was gross and it took a while for us to convince the kids that it was safe to use. It was clean but old and in disrepair. We had a partial ocean view and the view was fabulous. It did not feel \"partial\" at all. We appreciated the casual, beachy feel of the lobby and the rest of the hotel. After all, we went to Hawaii to relax and all we needed was a good beach. The staff was quite friendly, but since we were not there to visit with the staff, we didn't care either way. The restaurant was not very good and the drinks in the lounge were weak at best. We wandered down to see the Sheraton and Hyatt to see if they would be worth the splurge. The Sheraton was a mob scene at the beach and the pool. The Hyatt was beautiful, but filled with folks on their computers and cell-phones. If you are on vacation to work, that would be a great place to stay. I would put the atmosphere and lack of crowds at the Royal Lahaina as an A+. We would probably come back but make sure that we were in an updated room (the hotel is in renovation). Two more tips....best Mai Tai's on Maui were at Aloha Mixed Plate, just 10 minutes from the hotel on front street. There was also a great breakfast/lunch dinner place called Soup Nut'z and Java Jazz.

This is not the 70s. Its not right, that you pay top dollar to stay in these hotels, but have to endure hard beds, crummy old tvs, small old style bathrooms besides the rooms being small already, out-dated furniture thats been used for years and years. The beach is wonderful, the location is superb, but the hotel? Motel6 quality, even in the tower rooms. Its not just the Royal Hawaiian, its all the other major resorts as well. They want to give you the bare minimum, however, pay top dollar for out-dated old rooms. Not our style, back in the 70s, yeah it was great, but Hawaii needs to catch up to 2004. We don't mind paying top dollars for resort hotels, however, we do mind, when we are not getting our moneys worth. As for maid service, forget it. They don't even care. How about taking a windex bottle and washing the mirrors and the sliding door out to the balcony. You are paying for the view, right? You just have to do it yourself. Its so sad, that people do not like their jobs. Even though you are only in the room for a short period of time each day, it would be nice to have modern amenities, not a 25 yr old tv.

I can honestly say we never had a bad time. We stayed three weeks last Ocober/November (2003) and had a great time. We have always opted to stay in the three story Royal Hale building which is on the north side of the property next to the luau grounds. We stayed for five days one time in the tower and didn't care for the trek to the beach. The Royal Hale is three stories high and I would recommend the second or third floor AWAY from the luau, but being close isn't too bad since we were usually out during most of the luau festivities. The ocean view from this building's front rooms is awesome and just a stone's throw from the water. After a night or two the sound of the waves are welcome white noise. The view from the first floor of this building is blocked by vegetation. We had wonderful views of Molokai and Lanai. This building is a bit out of the main stream and usaually very quiet. The luau customers surround the place though in the afternoon waiting to get in and they take pictures right in front of the building. Can be amusing to watch. We always stay in October, which is the off season. Halloween in Lahaina is one BIG party!!! They call it the Mardi Gras of the Pacific. Thousands of people along Front Street in Lahaina in costume. We bring our own costumes from home now and always have fun. Great place to people watch. The room in the resort itself was neat and clean but a little tired. The toilet/shower room is small and that sliding door could use updating, but it's acceptable. Some very small red ants running around the bath and on the porch, but nothing to fret about. The room has a very small dorm fridge in it which could be bigger. The grounds of the hotel are wonderful and well kept. Not perfect, but nice. The beach is the best part. Isn't this what you come for? Very quiet and not too many people. There is great snorkeling just to the north about 200 yards starting in front of the public beach and going north. All sorts of fish, some eels, an octopus or two, an occasional turtle and even a small white tipped shark (with a hook in his mouth!). I did the scuba dive off Black Rock twice with the resort instructor, but it wasn't really too much better than just snorkeling. We never had a problem with the staff. They were always helpful when needed. We're easy to please and really had very few, if any, reasons to call them. The food in the restaurant was good. Breakfast buffet was typical with nothing really outstanding. After eating there, you really don't need lunch. Aloha Mixed Plate, next to the Old Lahaina Luau is one of our favorite places for supper. It's a very casual place and you eat at patio furniture on a deck out of take-out foam trays with plastic cups for drinks, but the food is always the best (two scoops rice, one scoop mac salad). Just love the Shoyu Chicken! Inexpensive too. Mama's Fish House was very good and very pricey. Staying for three weeks, my wife and I are looking for a bargain, and the Royal Lahaina is about as inexpensive as you can get for a resort on Kaanapali. We could probably only stay for a week or so at the other resorts for the same price. You REALLY don't spend that much time in the rooms to make it worth the difference (the Mrs. and I aren't newlyweds ;). The road to Hana is much improved in the last 5 years with the roadway being wider. It's not the white knuckle drive it used to be. Go ahead and drive all the way around. It's better than seeing the same sights on the way back. The unpaved portions past the Seven Pools were well packed gravel/dirt. Very desolate back there and little traffic. Don't go this way if heavy rains in the mountains as the road goes through a BIG wash valley on the north side. I imagine this would be a river to the ocean in the rainy season.

We know that it wasn't one of the top resorts in the area, but with the exchange, our budget was a factor since we wanted to spend two weeks in Hawaii. We booked our trip months ahead of time and requested a quiet room on a floor higher up. When we checked in, we were in a room in the building that was directly over the luau and very loud. I have to tell you, that I am not a princess by any means, but my heart sank when we entered this room. It was dark, smelled awful, the carpet was discusting and there were numerous stains on the couch in the room. I requested that we be moved, which we were, to a room in the same building but on the back side on the ground floor. It was marginally better. The following morning when we headed out, we decided to ask the manager what our options were as far as changing rooms. He was very accomodating, and admitted that the area of the resort that we were in was tired. We were offered a room in the tower or a room in one of the cottages for no extra charge. We snapped up the cottage room and were very happy with the upgrade. We were on the golf course behind Basil Tomatos Restaurant. While the walls were thin, this room was much larger, very bright, quiet and seemed cleaner. We did not opt for the coffee/safe/parking/phone call package. We brought our own coffee and only ended up making two calls so we saved money there. When they say there's a fridge in the room, that was all there was. We had to buy cutlery, cups and coffee filters to be able to have our own coffee and snacks in our room. A mouse, lizard and weird bug (cochroach?) were found in our room but in a tropical climate on the ground floor it wasn't totally unexpected. We were disappointed there was no bathtub in our room though. The maid service starting banging on our door at 8:15 am, which is way too early in my opinion. We did have a privacy tag which we used most mornings. The bar/lounge had decent drinks and we ate lunch or a light dinner there a few times and were satisfied. The beach was spectacular and the pools were decent. We didn't attend the luau so we can't provide any information regarding that. Overall, I'd recommend it to others on a budget but we wouldn't stay here again. As for Maui, we snorkeled at Kapalua Bay, Black Rock and Molokini.

When I checked in the girl went over with me the length of stay number of people in my room and so forth. They give you the option to pay for a package which includes parking, in-room coffee and tea for a little discounted price so I said ok to that. She then informed me that we had been upgraded to an ocean view room. When we were taken to our room it only had 1 bed and there were 3 of us (which she knew because she confirmed that on check in). So we had to go back downstairs to get another room. No other rooms were ready so we had to wait. We decided to have lunch while we waited so we put our luggage in the room of my sister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family who was traveling with us, otherwise they would have just left it sitting out in the lobby.

They said that while we went to dinner they would send up housekeeping to re-clean the bathrooms but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. What a horrible night. The beds were tiny and had flat-as-pancake pillows. We signed a form giving them permission to move our luggage the next day to a different room because we had plans and could not hang out at the hotel til sometime between 1:00-3:00 which is when they said that they could move us. When we returned they had moved us two doors down. The new room did not smell, had bigger beds, fluffier pillows and a brand new comforter. I wonder if they just see what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put up with before they give you a decent room? Anyway, I have been in better motels than this resort! The bathrooms are awful. There is a sliding door to shut off the toilet and shower area of the bathroom. Ours closed all the way at the top but there was about a 2\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gap as you got to the bottom. The showers are disgusting! There is some kind of panel above them that the paint is chipping off and cold water drips out constantly. The bottom of the shower had a lot of chips of porcelain missing. Both the rooms and my sisters where the same way. Oh, in the first room the toilet seat did not match the toilet. It was a different color and did not fit properly. It was just an old cheap plastic one. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible to get yourself ready. Part of the wall was missing in the toilet area at the door jam. Come on, how can they not repair these things in a resort! The knobs on the closet door were disgustingly dirty as was the telephone. Yuk! My sister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room had a iron burn mark in the rug. The entire room is not carpeted, just around the beds. Can they not afford to replace this? As others said, the elevators did smell like fish. The bar lounge smelled funny too. I might expect a bathroom like this if I picked a slum area motel that rents by the month to homeless but not from a resort. I was supposed to be on vacation for heaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake!

They charge extra if you drink those. There was an area where they had cut out a big square in the wallpaper and then tried to glue it back on but it was coming unglued around the edges.

Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell you what was good just incase for some insane reason you still want to stay here. The resort is very pretty. Lovely tropical plants, golf course and beach. The lobby was very nice. You can tell when this place was first built it was really nice. The decorating in the hallways and elevator were really neat and Hawaiian. There is an excellent place to snorkel in front of the Sheraton next door. The staff was nice enough. Views out the balcony were great! It is just a shame that they have let other things run down so badly. When in the sleeping part of the room away from the bathroom, it was nice as long as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice how grimey the phone is. We had no complaints about the pool or beach. Breakfast buffet was just ok. It is not bad for one day or maybe two but I would not want you to commit to eating it everyday of your stay. The dinning room was nice. I read the mixed reviews before I went and wish I would have listened to the warnings! We are used to staying in Howard Johnsons and Best Western types so I am not a Hotel Snob. But the rest of it did not make up for the filthy, gross, bathrooms. Stay somewhere else! Be sure to do the road to Hana. Get some kind of a guide when you do. We had the Hawaii for Dummies book and it told you exactly where to stop to get out of your car and walk a very short ways to see waterfalls. You can swim in them and it is neat experience. There is also a black sand beach at a park that starts with a \"W\" I don't remember the name at about 32 miles in that was really beautiful! Kobe's in lahaina was great for dinner. Better to make reservations though. Snorkeling at Molikini is Great! It is expensive though so if you want to save money the snorkeling infront of the Sheraton at Kaanapali beach is really really good too (free).

I have no complaints on the resort... contrary to some other postings, and we found the staff to be courteous and friendly and resort to be great. While not a Sheraton, it had its own charm and the location was excellent. The beach was clean and right by the resort. The restaurants were great, and even accomodated us after normal closing on the day we arrived. Parking was tight due to the luau's held there every day, so you sometimes had to walk a ways to get to the hotel lobby. The luau was good but I recommend you go to one of the others off site. The tour operators had booths in the lobby and were always eager to support your needs. Plenty of tours to take if you want to, and prices were reasonable. Took the road trip to Hana and found it to be fantastic. You need to start early though and watch the road if you are driving. Several good spots to get off to take pictures and to get snacks. The banana bread at some of the stops was GREAT! Ate lunch at Hana, found it reasonable. Get a good map to find key locations and mark it ahead of time. Try to be out by sunset as the driving after dark is rough and the roads narrow. As they advertise, lots of one lane bridges, hills and some drivers were going too fast for conditions... Went to Molokai on a day trip and had a great time. Also went snorkeling... the waters were great. The airport was busy... need to get their ~2 hours before your flight. We had a minor problem with our connecting flight and were not told the airline was not in the main terminal. Aloha Island Airlines is about a 10 minute walk... Make sure you have the right airline if you are going on to Oahu. Our travel agent messed this up on us. Rental cars were no problem, but gas is high. Paid ~ $2.70 gal. Lots of great restaurants... enjoyed Mama's Fish House the best. Also liked several in Lahaina. Our room was neat and clean, and on the 6th floor. Recommend at least the 4th floor or higher to get a good view of the ocean. I opted not to go all inclusive and found was best since we were out on the island during the day. Would have no problem going back... and in fact my wife and I miss it already. It was so peaceful and quiet there. Took the sunrise trip to Haleaka... 2 AM is just too early but my wife wanted to see it. It was cold ~ 40 degrees, so bring a jacket and gloves. Once the sun came up, it warmed up fast. Took over 500 pictures while I was there with my digital camera... didn't realize it was so many until I got home. Take a close look at helicopter tours before you decide. We went with Sunshine and were a little disappointed we did not get to see a lot of spots shown in their ad. I thought it was too expensive for what we saw and the pilot was not much for narrating the trip. Also, the video they made for us was not free as advertised on TV there, it was $20 and not worth it.

Oh and there are some small Barracuda that hang out there... don't worry they're friendly. I enjoyed snorkeling here more than I did at Molokini.

Bring a suitcase full of your snack foods, cold cereal, drink boxes, paper products, etc. You can easily save $50.00 per day by doing this and skip eating out once a day. Also, bring your own snorkel gear, bring a guide book so you know the good beach access places and the sites along the road to Hana.

It DOES NOT compare in any way to a 3-star hotel like Holiday Inn/Express, Hampton Inn, AmeriSuites, DoubleTree, and even the Embassy Suites (those are all 3-star rated hotels). The Royal Lahaina is more like a 2-star hotel, since it has not been properly renovated and does not deserve any higher rating.

I ended up having to pay full price for one of my dinners (a $21.95 pasta dish, yeah right!!) because they used one of my free dinners as my companion's that night!! He had the $9.95 chicken, did not have a meal plan AT ALL at that hotel and no amount of explaining to the staff at the desk or in the restaurant helped.

Both the food and entertainment was very good and it was about $60.00 less for both of us..

We had to go back down to the desk with our bags, and the patient bell man, to get a new room.

The second sign of negativity was the many reviews on this website indicating that the hotel was in need of renovation, the service was mediocre, the parking was bad... yadda, yadda, yadda. All are true. From my experience, this hotel was terrible. I travel quite often for work and pleasure and stay at hotels ranging from the Hampton Inn and Courtyard Marriot all the way to Sheraton Grand or Westin types. Let's just say that the Royal Lahaina will have trouble competing with most Courtyard Marriots and many Hampton Inns if they were sitting on Ka'anapaali Beach. If you're not dead set on that area and would like to save $$, I would highly suggest, as an alternative to the Royal Lahaina, looking down towards Kihei, where some of the hotels are less expensive and the beach area are quite nice also.

Its not a terrible place, but the owners need to invest some cash to upgrade the place. First impessions were ok, we had a bit of trouble finding it because there is no actual sign in front stating \"Royal Lahaina Resort\", so we spent a few minutes figuring out where to pull up. The lobby was open and spacious, check in was easy, and a bellboy graciously helped us get to our room in the 'royal hale' building (not the tower). Our room was on the 2nd out of 3 floors. I was worried about the fact that the door had a regular key lock and not a key card - not very secure. The room was slightly larger that we were expecting - about 300 sf or so with a bathroom sink area separated by a semi wall, commode/shower niche (no bath tub) separated by an old sliding door which did not provide much privacy and a patio with enough room for a couple chairs and a small table. There was also another sink in the room and a small refrigerator. Other decor was basic with a dresser, table, 19 inch tv(with about 8 channels) and 2 full size beds and a love seat couch. I would consider a microwave to be essential for any one staying in Maui for any legnth of time given the expense of food, we didn't have one. The room was fairly clean with the exception of clearly visible foot prints on the wall where some one layed on the bed with their feet on the wall. The rest of the hotel includes a resaurant/ bar overlooking a basic rectangular pool, several small stores in an outside area, and an outside luau area which we didn't go to. We also didn't eat at the restaurant as we thought it was very expensive ($16 for chicken for instance, more for anything else). There is also tennis courts and a laundry room to wash your clothes for $5 a load including soap. Royal Lahaina also has cottages reviewed by others. The beach is right off the hotel. It is sort of narrow, but not too bad, and there is a wider beach a 10 minute walk away. The beach drops off steeply so the waves can break kinda hard - not suitable for small children to play near the water. Its nothing like Cresant or Daytona beaches. Back to the room, my biggest of 2 complaints is that the walls are VERY thin. Also, if some one sits or moves on the bed in the next room, it shakes the thin wall - the beds are attached to the wall. So if some one's rugrat is jumping on the bed in the next room, its more than annoying. Also, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, there are alot of charges at this hotel. A 2 cup packet of coffee is $3 a day, the safe was $3.75 or so, and parking is like $7 or 8, so you can get a package deal for $14 or something. We thought that was very chintzy - never paid for daily coffee at any other hotel. It certainly adds up. To make outside calls is also expensive - bring your cellphone, our Sprint phones worked fine with no roaming. Also, room service forgot to leave us the coffee (we had already payed for via the package deal) and wash cloths 2 days in a row, we mentioned it to the manager and it was promptly taken care of. Another thing which should be mentioned is that the hotel places a $50 charge per day as a deposit on your credit card as a pending transaction. This was not told to us by the hotel before hand. Additionally, the parking lot can get jammed up and you might have to park quite a ways from your room. To wrap it up, I'd say this hotel was OK - nothing fancy. Next time I'd try to find different accomidations. My last piece of advice is not to book daily excursions through the hotel, grab the flyers and call directly, you can probably do things cheaper that way.

Friendly people, great scenery, and delicious food. Don't let the poor reviews scare you out of staying here. Yes, the parking costs $9.00 per day, the water pressure comes and goes and the water temperature is anything but constant, however, the hotel does grow on you. Rosario at the front desk and June the manager were very friendly. Let's not forget the excellent job done by our room cleaner Yolanda! If you're the type of people who don't mind going to Foodland or Long's Drugs to pick up your snacks and beverages, you'll love this hotel. If you're the type to stay in and use the amenities provided by the hotel at a nominal fee, it will cost you! The food at the resort is acceptable, nothing to brag about. If you have a car (as most island travelers do) I suggest driving over to Wailea, Kihei, Makawao or Lahaina for your meals. If in Kihei, try eating at Stella Blues for dinner, around there for lunch, eat at the Sports Page (great burgers!). In Wailea, I highly recommend the Maui Prince Hotel's Prince Court restaurant (not open on Tuesdays) and Joe's Restaurant...great service and food! In Makawao, eat at Casanova's...great Italian food! We eat there everytime we go to Maui! In Lahaina, try true fire greats like, Hard Rock Cafe, Longhi's, Bubba Gumps's, Roy's Restaurant, and Hecock's. When we travel, we love to see the places we go to. We hop in the car and go site seeing and hardly stay in the room. We love to rent SUVs and go off roading, great for Maui's unpaved roads. But when we do go back to rest, relax and sleep, it was nice to know that our room would be clean, ready and waiting for us. Our sheets and towels were changed daily, our room vacuumed and cups washed. We left our room cleaner a daily tip...we reward excellent service! Yes, this is not the best resort on the island, it's not the posh Grand Wailea Resort and Spa or Four Seasons but it is quite nice. The staff is friendly, the clientele nice and rates reasonable. What more could you ask for? Not many of us stay in our hotel rooms anyway, we go out, we site see and shop. If you are the type to stay in and enjoy the amenities that the resort has to offer...the Royal Lahaina Resort offers that too! There are shops and restaurants on premises, beach within walking distance, a luau (food is pretty good at the luau), a small pool, a golf course etc...

This hotel is not a good value and is not a convenient location. See my recommendations for other hotels at the bottom of my review. We arrived at the hotel on March 22, 2004 in pouring rain and checked in around 3:45 pm. We waited in line for at least 20 minutes and we were only the third couple in line. When I checked in, I was not offered a parking pass for our rental car so I had to come back for it. Parking is $9/day, with phone calls $1 for the first 20 minutes, including 800 numbers, and use of the in-room safe is $3.75 per day. You can purchase a $12/day package that includes all of these fees, but I still think the charges are a little steep. There is no Weather Channel on hotel's cable, and they do not give free newspapers like some of the other hotels, so if you want to check the weather you have to make a phone call (for $1!) Also, if you put the bottled water in your mini-refrigerator, housekeeping will assume that you drank them and charge you $1.50 per bottle. (Bottles were on the bathroom counter when we checked in.) Some friends of ours did not know this until they checked out and were charged $6 for water they didn't drink. Our first room was on the 12th (top) floor and when we stepped off the elevator there were wastebaskets in the hall in front of our room collecting water. There were two more baskets inside our room. Water was leaking EVERYWHERE! Management was obviously aware of the problem but they gave us the room anyway. When I called the desk to change rooms, the girl who answered was less than polite and never called us back. I tried calling the desk 3 more times but nobody picked it up. Finally the desk manager called to see if we needed something, and we were moved to another room on the 7th floor that was a little larger than the first room, but upon our first use of the bathroom we discovered another leak coming from the room above. At that point, the manager told us that there were several leaking rooms in the hotel and he wasn't sure if he had anything else available. I was so disgusted that we were ready to move to another hotel but were having a hard time finding vacancies. More than 3 hours after we checked in, the manager finally knocked on our door and gave us a dry room on the 9th floor. Dry, but still not worth the price. Paint was peeling in the bathroom, back of the main door was chipped, balcony had cracks running through it, our mattress had seen much better days - I could hardly sleep on it. I slept much better in the plane on the way home than I did on that ancient mattress. Could they at least invest in a pad to put over it so we couldn't feel the springs??? We had a partial ocean view, which was beautiful, but don't plan on going to bed early because the hotel has a luau on the grounds that gets pretty loud. Don't plan on taking a bubble bath! Our tub was only about 3 x 3. I did not have any problems with the water pressure or temperature until our last day, when I could only get lukewarm water out of the shower. I would recommend staying at any of the hotels on the South side of Black Rock rather than the Royal Lahaina. Kaanapali Beach Hotel, Sheraton, Westin Maui, The Whaler - all great beaches. The Royal Lahaina has a narrow beach and there are warning signs about strong current, Man-o-War, and steep dropoffs. The only kids we saw swimming in this area were wearing lifejackets, and even some of the adults were having trouble getting out of the water because of the dropoff and the undertow. The hotels at the other side of Black Rock have much wider sandy beaches, good snorkeling and swimming, and are all walking distance from the shops and hotels at Whalers Village. Most of the rooms at Kaanapali Beach Hotel are recently renovated and are similarly priced to Royal Lahaina.", "Date": "March 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cOlder, but great view\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1729801", "Content": "This is definitely an older facility: had room keys instead of cards.

We loved the location, being on the quiet end of Ka'anapali Beach was great. The grounds were well tended and picturesque, and we enjoyed our meals at the resort's restaurants- although with all the excitement on the wedding day, I could hardly taste my food anyway. (For fine cuisine we read the guidebooks and chose other places.) We only a few problems, which were related to services: On the morning of the wedding I had scheduled a manicure at the resort salon. I went to the appointment, which was for 10:00 am I believe, but the person who was supposed to do it was not there, and I was told \"I guess she's on break, or something-\". I waited for about 45 minutes, and she never showed up! At that point, I was scheduled for a massage down by the ocean- another mistake- I should have scheduled it for after the wedding, since pushing my face into the massage table pillow during the massage left me with puffy eyes- and they were still a little puffy many hours later when it was time for the ceremony. The other problem was the wedding cooridator, appointed by the Royal Lahaina, who caused us a couple of days of panic when we told her that we had hired our own photographer and videographer (we hadn't been impressed with the options she'd given us, because no sample work was available for us to see) she said we were only allowed to use people she had recommended- and we had already put down deposits with these people, which she did eventually approved for her list.

In addition, we stayed in the tower and found our room clean and well-tended. I highly recommend a whale watching excursion if you're there during the season. On the other hand, the on-site restaurant is not very good. The urge to just stay in the hotel and relax completely can be pretty strong...kind of defeating your motivation to seek out better restaurants. We wasted far too much money on only tolerable food- you're better off taking the shuttle to town. The grounds are dated and the pool area is somewhat small. The hotel on the whole feels pretty neglected. Bottom line: if you're feeling nervous about choosing the royal lahaina for a dream vacation or romantic adventure, I'd say listen to your gut and pick a nicer hotel.

We booked late for a Christmas week stay, so to get ANY hotel, we were lucky. We truly expected the worse. Actually, it wasn't bad....I'm a CLEAN freak, and wanted CLEAN. We rented 2 rooms for kids & us, and the rooms, beds, sheets were very clean. The bathrooms were clean, but in our room the overhead ceiling part in the shower had a metal cover with peeling paint. Definitely did not add to ambience. Yes, it was cheaper than other places, but a can of rusoleum and a pint of paint, we felt they could have afforded. The public areas and bathrooms all had fresh flowers and poinsettias that were allowed to wilt, and be unattractive late in the day. Yes, it's not a big deal, but again, a touch of TLC and the resort would be magnificent. The Beach Guys that worked at that desk were phenomenally helpful about surf, snorkeling, scuba, anything you wanted to know about water activities, they were MOST helpful and MOST on the mark. The restaurant was mediocre, but we didn't care about it. The beach, I think is the best around. It's not crowded---especially Christmas week---and it's close to the activities, but you could stay away if you wanted a more restful environment. We stayed in ocean view rooms on the front of the tower and our biggest complaint was the bus drivers loading buses at 2 am and BANGING luggage into their buses. Also, delivery people screaming at each other. We liked having the door open to hear the ocean, and ultimately opted for a/c and a closed door.

After reading quite a few negative responses I was extremely pleased with our experience. We stayed here from November 27th-December 2nd 2003. This resort really has an Old Hawaii feel. The rooms were clean. We first stayed in a Tower Room with a Partial Oceanview which was a bit noisy in the morning as we were directly over the hotel dropoff point so, as we had our kids along, we opted for an Oceanfront Cottage (at a minimal upgrade fee!) and it was terrific! Up every morning and in the ocean just steps away. Note about the bugs...we left a pizza out in the room and indeed there was bugs on it in the am...but you are in the tropics. The buffet breakfast was wonderful with an excellent selection w/ everything from fresh papaya & pineapple, to miso and rice, to hash :-) and egss, to good old fashioned oatmeal. You can't go wrong especially if you take one of their all inclusive deals. The pools were small but with the ocean at bathtub temperature in front of you...who cares! Plenty of places to lounge. The snorkeling at Black Rock was incredible for beginners and again a big plus is that this hotel is AWAY from the string of resorts right around the point which crowds the beach on that side considerably. We were going to stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel first and were most glad we did not as it was MUCH bigger than Royal Lahaina and there were no rooms there that were as close to the ocean as we were. These are the two oldest properties on Kaanapali Beach and, although this was evident, the Royal Lahaina was very well kept and the staff friendly. Staying at the Royal Lahaina was truly like staying at a secluded beach resort and it was awesome. If you like crowds....go around the corner.

My wife and I have been to Maui five times and we have stayed at the Ritz, Sheraton and Marriott hotels. The Royal Lahaina is definitely not on the same level as any of these hotels however it does have some redeeming values. First of all it costs much less to stay at the Royal Lahaina than the other three hotels. Over all you can stay a week at the Royal Lahaina for half the cost of the other hotels. The room charges are much less and the food was pretty good and priced less than you would pay at the more expensive hotels. Secondly if you like a low key out of the way atmosphere with allot of room to stretch out then you have come to the right place. The hotel seems to be one of the older hotels in the area and does not offer the large pools and overly impressive landscaping that the newer hotels offer and is in need of some remodeling. However you are not crowed and packed in like you are at the fancier hotels. The Royal Lahaina grounds are lush and spacious and the beach is very nice. Most of the staff is courteous and helpful with the exception of a few of the male waiters in the restaurant and bar and one or two of the front desk staff. I can't say much for the main tower rooms but our bungalow was great. It was spacious and clean and had a nice covered patio that faced towards the ocean. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Royal Lahaina. We recommend the hotel on the basis of its lower cost and its low-key atmosphere. If you want to save money and do not require all of the flash and hype of the fancier hotels on the island then The Royal Lahaina is the place to stay. However, take care when booking your stay and choose your rooms carefully. Some lodging areas of the hotel are much less desirable than others.

My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon; we spent 6 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Oahu and 2 nights at the Royal Lahaina on Maui. I can honestly say that I enjoyed the Royal Lahaina almost as much as the Hilton. I frequently travel to Hawaii, and I know just how expensive it is. Once I stayed one night in the Hyatt Regency on Maui, and it wound up costing close to $1000. However, at the Lahaina, my husband and I got an oceanfront cottage room with compact car rental, champagne, two tickets to the wonderful Royal Lahaina Luau, and a sunset sail all for only $650. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal on Maui, especially for what we considered to be a wonderful hotel. Our room was very comfortable, large, and clean. There was no mold or mildew and no cockroaches. The luau was wonderful--crowded, but well-organized, and one of the best I've ever been to in Hawaii. As for the service...well, I personally don't see how people can complain. We had wonderful service; all of the staff that we came in contact with was incredibly friendly and helpful. We were initially scheduled to stay for 3 nights but had to leave early; this was taken care of in about 3 minutes, and our bill was amended with no problems whatsoever. I can see how, during the busy tourist season, service might not be as good--probably because the staff is run ragged!--but that's the case for any hotel during Hawaii's busy season. Believe me. The towers did look run-down, and I imagine that those rooms are not as nice as the cottage room we had. But then, they're much less expensive. I'm sorry, but if you go to Hawaii and expect to get a great room for a very cheap price, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. It's just not going to happen. So don't complain and moan about it. If you want to vacation in Hawaii on the cheap, forego the hotel scene and camp at the many state parks. It's a fun alternative.

The main restaurants are also expensive. If I were you, walk past the Hale building, into the Aston Maui Kaanapali Villas next door. Eat at the Castaway Cafe there by the pool - great food and very reasonable prices. Also, the Royal Lahaina is in the middle of nowhere - you're miles from Lahaina.

I had read many reviews of this hotel before we left and had tried to change my reservations prior to leaving, but was unable to. We went there with dread in our hearts about the \"dump\" we would be staying in. However, the Royal Lahaina wasn't that bad. Sure the Brad's and Jen's of the world could never have stayed in a place like this, but it was adequate for all us normal, middle-income people. Yes, it is in need of updating - the place is old and deteriorating, but our room was clean and roomy and the maid service was very good. We stayed in the Kia Towers because we had heard too many awful things about the Hale building. While we did not get a chance to check that building out, it did not look very inviting from the outside. Our problem with the Royal Lahaina was unfriendly service people. I think they must not like working under the management of this hotel because not many of them were very cordial. The housekeeping people were friendly and kind as was the parking attendants but everyone else gave us the impression they were tired of tourists. The woman in the Emporium absolutely ignored me even though I tried speaking with her several times. The other thing that bothered us was they charged $5 per hour for snorkel equipment but you can go anywhere on the island and get them for $1.50 per day! The equipment as well as parking should have been free to guests staying here. They also charge you $3.75 for a 4-cup pot of coffee in your room. Save your money and bring your own from home along with some filters. We paid the extra $13 per day fee for the parking, coffee and room safe but we felt all of this should have been included with the price of the room. The food in the Ocean Terrace Room was generally pretty good and the price was fair. There are so many places to eat on this island that you don't have to eat a single meal at the hotel if you don't want to. We had an excellent meal at the Italian restaurant adjacent to the hotel although it was very expensive. There are many, many hotels on this island that were newer and had nicer amenities but if you've never been there you don't find out until you're there. This hotel had 3 pools but they were just small square boxes in the ground - good only for cooling off from the heat. My kids were very disappointed after seeing all the really cool pools at the other hotels. The beach couldn't have been better though. I think they have one of the best beaches on the island and the grounds at the Royal Lahaina were beautiful as well. All in all, we had a good stay but I would not go back there nor would I recommend this resort to any of my friends. There are so many better hotels to choose from that offer clean, friendly service for the same price. The Royal Lahaina needs an entire building and staff facelift if they want to get any repeat visitors because they do not go out of their way to make you feel wanted! Most of the hawaiian staff made us feel that we were bothering them. The friendliest staff were asian or american. If you get a good deal on your room, go ahead and stay here but be ready to give up courtesy and friendliness from everyone but a few. Also, they have a Luau every night so if you face the Luau you have to hear it every night in your room and you have to deal with the lack of parking space until it's over. The owners of this resort should take a look at what reviewers are saying because if they don't make some changes soon, they will be filing for bankruptcy in the near future.

The restaurants are kind of sad. The poolside bar/restaurant was okay. The Italian restaurant up the road was good, but very spendy. We had the breakfast buffet once--that was enough.

My wife and I picked the royal lahaina for the location. We were there from 6/20-6/28 and were pleased with our choice. The hotel is on one of the prettiest beaches I've ever been on with 2 great places to snorkel. The pool was rather plain, but we didn't spend much time there. The ocean view room had a beautiful view of the beach-gorgeous in the morning and evening. The hotel has a walking path that connects to the long beach trail that goes all the way to the Hyatt(approx 1.5 mi long). Around the midpoint of this trail is Whaler's village which has some nice shops and restaurants. We loved walking on the path everyday-checking out the different hotels and people watching. We were planning a very active vacation-seeing all the sights in a week. The hotel is close to many attractions making travel convenient. Also the hotel had a car package with a convertible sebring costing about 35/day. The bar and the restaurant were simple but had a nice view of either the garden or the ocean,and the food was surprisingly above average and cheap(steak dinner for under 20 dollars). The service througout the hotel was pleasant and helpful. Overall, although we were hesitant to initially stay there because some of the negative comments we had heard, we had a wonderful time. Of course not everything was perfect. For one , the rooms look dated-with both the ceiling and tub having cracks. Although we didn't see any mildew, the shower had a fairly noticeable \"mildewy\" odor. The carpets appeared old and faded with several stains.

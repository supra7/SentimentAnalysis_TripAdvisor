You probably also don't want to stay here if this is a romantic getaway, because I predict no romance on the getaway or for some time afterwards. Otherwise, let's face it; if you go to New York, any time you spend in your hotel is time you're wasting by not doing something awesome, so why pay $300-$400/night just for a place to pass out from exhaustion? Save your money for other things - because you'll need it! This was a trip to New York with my teenage sons before the oldest goes off to college. I'll be honest, I jumped at this place when I saw the price on hotels.com, *then* I noticed some of the reviews and the fact the bathrooms were not in the rooms. It was so cheap that I was tempted to just eat the non-refundable rent and book someplace decent, but it was Easter weekend and by that time, \"decent\" was $400+/night and nothing was available that would hold three people, so I would have needed 2 rooms or a suite!! In the end, I stuck with this, and I'm glad I did. Every time a restaurant bill took my breath away, I just said to myself \"but just think of how much I saved on the hotel!\". If you're from much of the US, you'll be surprised that a place like this even exists. It's more like what one still finds in big cities in Europe. It's OLD, and the walls are smooth with dozens of cut rate paint jobs. The room itself was fairly large and had a fridge. The beds were comfortable, but we had a rollaway that looked like WWII surplus. Nevertheless, we all slept comfortably. We were lucky enough to get an end room, where the door is in a little alcove that also contains a bathroom, so it was \"kind of\" private. As far as I could tell, no one else used it while we were there. Most of the bathroom was actually fairly clean and I did see the maid clean it every day, but by now there's only so much a human can do. At first glance, the tub looked absolutely filthy, but on closer inspection, it was actually mostly mineral deposits from decades of a dripping shower head. Interesting, in its own way. As I said, it had a fridge, and there's a decent market just around the corner, so we could have breakfast and snacks in the room. It's in a lovely neighborhood, steps from the Hudson and just round the corner from Trump Place. It's about a block from an express subway stop, and within walking distance of Central Park, Broadway, Times Square, etc. As they say, \"location, location, location\". We had a fantastic weekend, which in no way suffered from this hotel. In fact, it just added a couple more interesting stories.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat neighborhood location and good value\u201d", "Author": "Happytrails044", "ReviewID": "UR84972303", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this small hotel that largely caters to students.

Down fall-last night I was there I had to call them because I didnt get any clean towels. They sent someone right away. We wanted coffee for the morning but the rooms have no coffee pots. They gave us a electric pot to warm water in and we purchesed instant at the local store. They were also nice enough to round up a couple coffee cups for us to use. The day crew at the front desk were nice, the evening crew, not so much. My biggest complaint would be, I called for a 0520 wake up call to make an early morning flight. It was a good thing I set my phone alarm because I never received that wake up call. I also had arranged the night before to have the car service pick us up at 0600 and when I got down front he told me it was for 0630. He did however call and the service was there within 10 min.

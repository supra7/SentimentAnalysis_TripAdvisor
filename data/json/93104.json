{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Poor Housekeeping The property is quite tattered and needs some cosmetic maintenance and a thorough cleaning. I found the lobby furniture grungy to the point I would'nt want to sit in the chairs. The room I had was large, but the batroom was filthy, and there was trash in the corners which housekeeping hadn't picked up. I would look elsewhere to stay next visit.", "Date": "Nov 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR900618428", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "neastral"}, {"Content": "Defense of The Brent House Travelers should understand that The Brent House -- located just across the western parish line (equivalent of county in Lou.) from New Orleans -- is a hotel adjacent to the grounds of Ochsner Hospital for the convenience of loved ones of patients. If a family member is in I.C.U. this is a godsend, as was the case with my family otherwise would have had to commute and hour from their homes. If travelers are referred to The Brent House, it is probably because the hotel is not filled. And, during the city's seoncd most popular tourist event, Jazzfest, room availability is scarce and prices thoughout town are higher than normal. So cut The Brent House some slack or do what all travel experts recommend: your homework!", "Date": "Dec 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR502684104", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "not really a hotel I thought I would be close enough to downtown and jazzfest.

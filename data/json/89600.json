The rooms were spacious for a city hotel and the bathrooms were very clean (not that I would expect less from a Radisson brand hotel). One of the best features about this hotel is the rooftop pool, whilst we were in Boston the weather was very hot and sticky so the breeze and comfy loungers and hammocks were much appreciated! The pool is actually enclosed in with an attaching gym with a lounging area outside, I must admit it was initially very strange to sunbathe to the sound of horns and sirens but we soon were so relaxed we drowned them out! The pool was quite busy at times with children but in the mornings and evenings if was much quieter if you wanted to tip a quick dip without splashing and loud children. On most floors there were vending machines and ice machines for your convenience which was great if you fancied a little treat at night. One thing I must advise you to remember is that the elevators are controlled by your room key card so if you are travelling with older children and teenagers and they may be separated from you at times it is advisable to request a couple of room keys at the start of your stay otherwise they will forever trapped in the lobby unless some other guests joins them in the lift! We didn't have breakfast or any other meals in the hotel as there was so many good places to eat nearby. For breakfast we sometimes just wanted to grab something quick and across the road a block down there is a 7/11 for things like little cereal boxes with a small bottle of milk and pastries/muffins. At the local subway station there was also dunkin donuts and starbucks for a quick bite. For dinner we mainly went into the market but nearby the hotel there is a couple of great restaurants and some chains too like California pizza kitchen. A few blocks down to the left there was a great little Irish pub which did a beautiful steak and mashed potato combo with really friendly service (plus it was very reassuring to hear an accent from home!) For getting around the city we typically just walked, with the odd taxi and also used the hop-on hop-off trolley which stopped literally at the door of the Radisson which was very handy. Finally I must praise the efforts of the concierge he was very attentive and helpful, even striving to secure us last minute Red Sox tickets and we found ourselves chatting away to him about Boston for ages!

I'm a New Yorker, so everyone knows of that unspoken rivallary between Boston and New York, especially because me and my boyfriend are hardcore Yankee and Giants fans, and one thing I could appreciate is being treated like a person as opposed to a guest. That saying, I appreciated his sense of humor and not taking offense to my boyfriend's NY attitude (cause we all know how rude New Yorkers are) That being said GO GIANTS nananana! Going up to the room, it was nothing special, again, staying in hotels often, I'm not easily impressed. I did love the view, except there is nothing as breath taking as a NYC view, but again, that's just the bias NYer in me. I called down the FD a few times, and I appreciated the rapid responses I got. The only thing I found annoying was when the agent answered the phone, she actually used my name. I found it annoying only because me and my boyfriend don't have the same last name, and we both found it rude for him to be called Mr. (ME). And again, I'm not used to the politeness. That's my only PERSONAL pet peeve. Richard and John, awesome guys. Again! Hardcore Boston fans with the understanding of NY humor. We did this everywhere, we're proud New Yorkers fuggetabutit ;) They both told us where the poor excuse with a 2am last call \"nightlife\" was. And we did some touring around the following morning as well. When we were forced to call it a night at 2:30, we tried to wind down the night by watching some movies, but we weren't able to watch the movies. It kept telling us to call the FD, I found this odd because I put down $100 for incidentals, why should I have to call down the FD? We called, and we were comped breakfast. I guess this was ok.

It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Newbury Street (great shopping street with some good cafes) and a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and a 7 Eleven are all a 2 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is under major refurbishment and looks like a building site. Reception/front desk is similar to a car rental pick up place and is in a parking lot area. We had a room on the 18th floor which was obviously not a renovated one; plenty of space and big beds but a tired interior. Unfortunately there was a lot of drilling and background work at odd hours but we slept quite well. Free wifi is available in the rooms. The hotel offers complimentary tea and coffee on the 24th floor but on two occasions during the day we found the room to be locked. There is meant to be tea and coffee facilities in the room but a coffee percolator Is for coffee only; and coffee tasting tea/hot water. No minibar but a safe in the wardrobe along with a hair dryer, an iron and ironing board. Plenty of towels and toiletries provided but be aware of the aircraft style suction toilets. Room service is obviously available but low quality and high priced food with automatic 18% gratuity extra charge and $4 admin fee!! A margherita pizza on room service would cost you about $30 with the charges........ The Rustic Kitchen restaurant attached to the hotel offers a good choice of wines, drinks and food and the staff were very friendly. Otherwise try one of the many local seafood restaurants.

I wasn't sure what to think of the hotel at first as the front of the hotel had tarp all over it due to renovation, I assume. But walking into the lobby, we found it very clean and charming. We were tired from our flight from California, and our check in was quick and easy. We were given a map of the area along with our room key. This was very helpful, although we seemed to navigate the streets with ease by the next day. They offer parking, but since we were not picking up a car (rental agency was just across the street), until the day we departed on our driving trip, I couldn't tell you the cost. The concierge quickly made our restaurant reservations for both that evening and the next. We left our bags with the bellboy, thinking that our luggage would make it to our room in a somewhat timely manner, but after half and hour, my husband decided to retrieve them from the lobby as they were still sitting on the cart, and we were anxious to explore this lovely town. The first thing I noticed was how large the room was. There is a seperate sitting area with sofa and coffee table, along with a television set. (there is also a flat screen t.v. in the bedroom area). I noticed that the room had two thermostats for heating and a/c. One in the sitting area, and one near the bed. The room was supplied with a coffemaker (was that handy in the morning), The bathroom was large with plenty of vanity counter space. Bathrooms come with a hair dryer, and magnifiying mirror which I was thankful for. (I hate lugging those things along). The first night , we were so exhausted that we did not realize that the bed had a gizmo attached to the mattress that would inflate the mattress due to your comfort preferences, so we grumbled to ourselves the next morning about the hardness of the bed until we discovered this delighful controller. The next night was much more comfortable, but I do wish they just supply comfortable beds to begin with. The drawbacks to this hotel was that our room was located behind the elevator, and we could hear it all night long as people utilized it, as well as the frequent sirens on the street, although we were 22 stories up. The restaurant located just across the covered entry from the main lobby served breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Our experience was with breakfast and though at an extra cost, was delightful. The food was offered buffet syle or you could choose off the menu. Service, though a little slow, was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really good. The best reason for staying at this hotel, was the location. We walked to the Boston Commons and Public Gardens, and caught the hop-on, hop-off, trolley just a few blocks away. Restaurants are within walking distance and there are several stores (they are big on CVS's) nearby. You can walk to the theatre district, and it seemed very safe to walk around this area.

The size of the room, number of drawers and closet space, in room safe, free bottled water, and bathroom were excellent (we had 2 queen beds). The toilets in Boston are really loud and go WHOOSH!

Arriving at 11.30pm without my luggage (thanks, Delta!), the 1970s tired look didn't exactly lift my heart. However, the night checkin person (Stephen I think) was utterly excellent. A bag full of toiletry essentials appeared, several bar vouchers ('have a drink to recover'), and some breakfast vouchers were a considerate, friendly touch. Stephen asked if I'd mind switching to a twin-double room so that he could give me a room on a higher level and so with a view. I didn't and gained a great view for my 4 days there. The room was simple, clean and functional: again, 1970 came to mind. However, the beds were supremely comfortable and the free (yes!!) wifi was really very good indeed. Friendliness extended to all staff: the cleaners were helpful and chatty, all of the reception, baggage and business centre staff were helpful in an unforced way. There also seemed to be a lot of managerial staff in evidence generally checking on guests, pitching in etc. Air con units in the rooms were a bit old and noisy, but easy to turn off and adjust. There's a swimming pool on the mezzanine (on top of the car park) leading onto a roof bar area (unstaffed, you need to phone for service and then it's charged at Room Service rates). Pool's not tiny, but a bit over-chlorinated. There're no showers on the floor, but it's great to sit and read on the roof. The location was excellent too: spitting distance of Boston Common, walking distance to Beacon Hill and Back Bay, taxiable everywhere and metro close too. Normally I wouldn't have picked a Radisson after some dodgy experiences in the past, but this has changed my view.

Makes a great way to start your vacation. The staff was able to set us up in a higher floor but it needed to be clean by the cleaner staff. We were perfectly happy to leave our luggages with the bell boy, grab lunch and then do the check-in afterwards.

We were placed in a suite on the second highest floor with a beautiful view of the city (and partial view of the sea). The washroom was long and narrow. It was recently renovated with a walk-in shower, white 'subway style' tiles, and large mirror. The only complain I had was that there were no hooks (not even 1) to hang clothes, just a narrow countertop which sits very closely to the toilet. Some previous reviews also mentioned the sleep number bed wasn't working properly, ours had a similar issue but we dismissed it in the grand scheme of things especially when you are exhausted after a full day of walking around in the city! We also met the conceiage person who was very professional and keep tabs on every guest. He would often ask how the guest enjoyed the city as he sees them coming back to the hotel. From what I observed, he seems very genuine in making sure everyone was having a good time. He also did something extra special for us. We had inquired about Boston famous Cannoli and the best way to 'store' them. According to him, it's best to eat it right away but storing them in the fridge would be okay as well. Well we told them there was no mini-fridge available in the room as generally most city hotel offers that in their room. To our surprise, he offered to have room service bring up a fridge for us so we can store our cannolis! We were skeptical but none-the-less happy that he offered.

Though the weather was rainy and windy, we had an enjoyable stay in Boston. (We had our own umbrellas, but the Hotel did offer us a loan of their umbrellas - very thoughtful!) This Hotel has 24 floors and is located in the Back Bay area of Boston. The City Place Mall is conveniently situated diagonally across Stuart Street. (Try D'Angelos clam chowder - I had the best soups in the 3 cities I visited this time.) Ice cream seems to be extra delish in the States, too.... Quincy Market has a huge hall of food offerings. Food is a big part of their daily routine (and mine, come to think of it!) - there's someone eating somewhere at all hours of the day and night! You can choose foods according to your whims and your finances. We stayed in room #1905 which was to the side of the hotel but there were no obstructions to our views of that part of the building skylines and streets in our area. There was a small balcony but the sliding doors did not open onto it - for safety, I would guess. There was the usual shower/bath/toilet combination. The hotel's position was quite central to the Boston Common and the T at Boylston subway station both of which were about a 5-10 minute walk away. The Subway system is quite easy to navigate (as are most of the underground train setups in the States) and this is from someone who doesn't take trains in Australia!! In Charles Street South (just across the road the down the street) is the location for the Boston Hop On/Hoop Off Trolley bus. The 'free' harbour cruise which lasted about an hour was a nice relaxing way to see the Boston Bay area.

It was conveniently located to everything we wanted to see in Boston and our stay was excellent. Check-in staff were probably the friendliest and most pleasant I've ever encountered at a hotel. We were able to check in around noon and had a great view of the city from our room on the 20th floor. The balcony was awesome! The room itself had plenty of space for a large-city hotel room (I was expecting smaller, based on stays in cities like Chicago), and although it took a few minutes to figure out the Sleep Number beds, they were comfortable and we looked forward to falling into them after a long day exploring the city. Bathroom was very nice and updated. Plenty of counterspace to unpack our toiletries. Housekeeping did an excellent job with cleaning our room promptly each day. We didn't check out the pool or rooftop or the Rustic Kitchen. We did go to Legal Seafood across the street and had a so-so experience. The one negative was that a bellman at the Radisson hailed a cab for us (very nice) and was confused about where an attraction we wanted to visit within Boston was located...so therefore gave the cab driver incorrect information. It took a few minutes to sort out with the cab driver, and with the help of our phones, we got to our destination. I assumed bellman were knowledgeable about all aspects of a city, but not so in this situation. (Our destination was only 2 miles from the Radisson, but it was pouring, which is why we called a cab.) No biggie, but just frustrating for a few minutes. There was some construction happening during our stay, but it was only bothersome on the day we checked out.

Upon entering the hotel the manager greeted me practically at the door and suggested that they may have a room ready for me. I was floored considering that check-in doesn't start until the afternoon. The desk staff let me know that housekeeping would beginning at 9 and I might have a room by 10am. I settled in for coffee at the diner next door and got a call 45 minutes later to let me know the room was ready. I was in my room and relaxing by 10am. This to me was excellent customer service. Room: The room was clean, comfortable and the A/C had been turned on so it was already nice and cool during our hot summer's day visit. The balcony and views were a treat for my mom who had never been to Boston. The sleep number beds were comfy, but they don't seem to really work that well. Bathroom: Very clean with all the usual amenities. My only complaint here would be the water pressure being a bit light and the water temp being a bit difficult to gauge, differing in temp each morning. Property: The hotel is situated in convenient walking distance to two subway stops. The neighborhood was safe and near the theater district so there was nightlife if that's your thing. The pool is indoors and affords a good workout swim due to its length. There's a deck at the pool level where you can layout in the sun or hang out and read. Breakfast: We opted to eat in the city rather than at the hotel, but the buffet looked fine when I was having my coffee the first morning. If you do venture out I can recommend the Parish Cafe right up the street and Paramount on Beacon Hill. Other: Solid wifi signal, couldn't hear a thing through the walls and key card access to all room floors had us feeling safe and secure. Pros: Centrally located, great staff.

I enjoy the high end beds at other good hotels and was looking forward to trying out this type of bed. Well, the bed was terrible. It felt like sleeping on a deflated pool mattress. I played with the setting for quite some time, over the two days and could not find a good setting. It did not help that the \"readout\" on the hand held controller did not work. i also am not sure the air pump worked properly. Perhaps this bed was not meant for commercial use. You cannot beat a pillow top or just a normal mattress. Our friends who stayed on a different floor also gave the bed a \"thumbs down.\" I did not complain nor ask for another room as the hotel was booked. I would give the bed zero out of five stars and the rest of the experience five out of five stars.

The following are some of the reasons why: (1) Horrible Air Conditioning. Our a/c was turned off when we arrived. Considering we were on the top floor and in Boston during extreme heat - this doesn't make sense. Our a/c ran continuously (with our drapes closed the entire time) from Friday am to Sunday am and it NEVER got below 78. We had to sleep on top of the sheets the entire time. Miserable. (2) Horrible Beds. Perhaps some people like the Sleep Number beds, but we found them to be deplorable. We were first put in a room where the bed didn't work. The remote didn't display a number at all. One side was hard as a rock and the other was a sunken mess. So if you wanted to move from one side to another it was like climbing a mountain. We had to change rooms because this bed was such a mess. The hotel did comp our room the first night, but because we were in town for a wedding and there were no rooms available for the 2nd night we were stuck there - still left paying a rate way more than what this hotel is worth. This hotel is really nothing more than a glorified motel. Note, when we got in the 2nd room - the TV didn't work. Stupid thing wasn't plugged in. Unbelievable. Even in the new room, where I guess the bed worked, it was horribly uncomfortable. Who wants to get in a hotel bed at night and have to adjust to a stupid sleep number. (3) Horrible Pool. The hairs on the white floor were everywhere. We tried to ignore it and take a swim to escape the heat of our room, but after about 3 minutes we had to get out because hairs floating in the pool were wrapping around our arms and legs. Nasty. (4) Horrible Alarm System. Of course, just as we were about to escape the mess of this hotel and check out, the alarm system went off. The alarm was hardly audible - it would never wake a mid-hard sleeper. Also, the alarm told us to wait until further instruction before we left. We were so thrilled to leave anyways, so we hiked down the 24 floors with our bags. The alarm, however, never actually told people to leave - even though fire trucks were out front when we got downstairs. (5) Noisy. The connecting doors in the room allow all of the noise to go through. On the final night and morning of our imprisonment there it sounded like a sorority meeting was taking place next door. Later saw about 5 teenage girls leaving the room. You could hear absolutely ever conversation they had - and I don't think they were even talking that loudly. (6) Other downfalls. - no mini fridges in hotel - balconies are sub par - no furniture or way to enjoy if you sit down - dingy, dark lobby - never any bellmen outside to help get taxi - had to get our own each time While the hotel did try to fix the situation with the bed by moving us to a new room - we were still stuck staying there for a wedding and paying a price well above what I would pay for a comparable motel. Paying $300 a night for no a/c, dirty, loud, uncomfortable, and unsafe conditions is ridiculous. I don't believe I have ever stayed at a Radisson before, but I will NEVER do it again.

The staff were pleasant and accommodating. Here is my one criticism, but it is one that can inform our decision on whether to book again at a hotel: The first room with the two queen beds had multiple ugly-looking stains on the carpet, a bathroom sink that was in bad need of a snaking, and a broken toilet paper holder that caused the roll to go flying. We requested and immediately received another room that was perfectly fine. But you cannot tell us that these issues were unknown to the staff BEFORE assigning the room. How many others were first steered to it and then asked for a more suitable room for the price? My point is that the room should NEVER have been assigned in the first place. First impressions are everything. As we waited for a cab on the day we checked out, a senior staff person asked us about our stay.

The hotel amenities listed on the website were accurately described and all available; after a long day of sightseeing, our son enjoyed the well-tended pool which, while not Olympic-sized ( and who would expect that in a downtown hotel anywhere-lol), was more than adequate with plenty of fresh towels available at all times.The hotel's location was perfect - within walking distance of the Public Garden, Boston Common, the beginning of the Freedom Trail, shopping on Newbury Street, numerous \"T\" (subway) stations, the Rustic Kitchen right next store where we had a very nice meal our first night after a long day of traveling and walking around the city, Legal Seafood restaurant across the street, a 7-11 and Dunkin' Donuts less than a block away for coffee,light breakfast foods, and snacks. We found the hotel very family-friendly. When we return to Boston, we will head right to the Radisson and encourage anyone considering it to do so.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat first visit to Boston\u201d", "Author": "Travelhappypair", "ReviewID": "UR115303864", "Content": "We have stayed at the Radisson for our first visit to Boston and it has proved to be a great choice.

I booked two hotel rooms, and requested that they be connecting rooms - Radisson was able to fulfill the request upon check-in. The hotel was beautiful, concierge was very helpful, and the bellhop was able to keep our luggage since we came to the hotel hours before the check-in. We did the Old Trolley Tour, then came back to the hotel for check-in. We were on the 20th floor, and those views were AMAZING! And we all flipped for the Sleep Number Bed. We had such a comfortable sleep that we were actually relaxed even though we had to check-out early that next morning (and the bellhop still kept ou baggage while we were finishing our Boston tour). The only setback is the parking garage charge of $75 for two cars - for one night. I may choose a different parking garage next time. I did not have a chance to see the pool but we have plans to come back and hopefully maybe Radisson can give me a free night (or maybe a good sicount)? I know I'm asking too much.

Our room was great, with a pretty decent view. It was roomy enough, very comfortable, and very clean. We weren't really crazy about the sleep number beds, but for one night, they were tolerable. The parking garage is a big winner, since parking in Boston is never easy, and I fully appreciated the safety of indoor parking.

We went up to the buffett before the server even made it to the table. The cold foods ( fruit) were warm and the hot foods (eggs, bacon, ham, pancakes) were cold. Tried to toast a bagel because I wanted something hot (it was cold & rainy that day)- the toasted started to smoke with something that was jammed and on fire in the toaster. Someone came and took the bagel and toasted it for me in the kitchen. When the coffee did finally arrive, it was hot and delicious. I would stay at the Radisson, but would not dine here again. There are many choices in the area. Our favorite was Magiano's right around the corner. Excellent Italian! Will be back during the summer and try to get the same room. I had read the elevators were slow, but we encountered no problems. Great friendly staff, well kept hotel!

It was nice to be able to have coffee in your room upon waking, walking to a Starbuks, DD's or to the restaurant on the premises for breakfast. Although we didn't have time for swimming the pool area was was very nice, water felt warm. The staff was starting to put greenery and flowers on the outside deck area which overlooked the city...pretty neat. The conveniences and the price of the hotel are awesome. We visited the North End of Boston and walked the Freedom Trail and Fauniel Hall- all within walking distance of front lobby door.

If you pay with the ticket when you leave, it's 5 dollars cheaper than the daily rate the hotel quotes. We had requested a king bed, but they didn't have one available.

The room was essentially clean, although showed some signs of aging and wear. The sleep number bed was very comfortable, but we could sleep on anything after a long drive. A few things to note- the toilet did flush very, very loudly- and you could hear other rooms' toilets flushing. The hotel is also very close to a major medical center, and we frequently heard sirens. These were minor nuisances and did not distract from our trip. The hotel cafe was a reasonable value with good food, service was a little slow. The hotel has a bar, but there was almost never anyone there. The cafe was much busier and had a very active bar scene.

The rooms were large and spacious, the bathroom was fairly small though and the shower was a rain shower which I didn't really like. The room seemed a bit dated in terms of furniture and I felt the price for the room was high. The main issue we had was the really noisy plumbing - we were next to the elevator which I didn't really hear but you could hear people going to the toilet above, below, side to side, and then because they have the powerful pressure flush (kohler toilets) the noise of the flush was quite incredible - with ear plugs in I often still jumped in bed when I heard a flush and it seemed to be happening every 5 mins so we must have been able to hear quite a few rooms! The hotel is fairly central in the theatre district although next time I visit Boston I will probably stay closer towards Newbury and Boylston St. One other thing - we used the ultimate livery shuttle recommended on the hotel's website to go to and from logan airport - I definately would not recommend this - the bus was old and basically (and this happened both ways) if the bus was not on the move it was blowing out boiling hot air from the side of the bus - I asked twice on the way in for the driver to do something as I thought I was going to pass out but he didn't really respond and said there wasn't much he could do - quite what happens to passengers in the summer I don't know!

Got there at 3:45pm, 45 minutes AFTER normal check-in and the room was not ready! Waited 15 minutes and then they said they had no idea how long it was going to take, so we went to eat a late lunch at Rustic Kitchen (another mistake, see review about that). Finally was able to check in around 5pm. We were told by the check-in clerk that our upgrade (to the 24th floor, top) would be given at no charge. Unfortunately, she apparently didn't put that in the notes as I was charged it upon check out. When I discussed this with them they didn't even know who checked me in, so they couldn't confirm this. After they called me back they finally agreed to remove the charge. They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee at the hotel, but you seem to have to argue with them over any issues. The room was very clean - the house keeping staff did an awesome job everyday (only thing that made the stay bearable). The rooms are big but the bathroom is tiny, can barely get more than one person in there at a time. Definitely had more room to make the bathroom bigger ... I have traveled all over the world and have never needed a keycard to get me to my floor (unless special floor), but you couldn't even go form the pool floor back to your room without the keycard. Most of the time it did not work well, and apparently one of the four elevators it did not work at all (was not required), so what was the purpose? The pool was MISERABLE! It is indoors on the top of garage but is not heated, which means that it is only heated by the air, which was 82-84 degrees. The water was 82, which is NOT conducive to enjoyment. I have NEVER been an indoor pool that was so COLD. There are no steps to get in, other than some old junky ladders, so if you need any help getting in/out, forget it. We had two room service meals (the restaurant associated with this hotel had miserable service, so we figured we would try room service). The breakfast we ordered had hard and cold scrambled eggs and soggy toast. Three of us for breakfast for $60 for that quality food was ridiculous. We tried an evening snack one night (cheese platter, fruit and yogurt platter, shrimp cocktail) and that was no better. The cheese was just big chunks of cheese (probably from the local grocery store). The menu said 5 shrimp, but only 4 arrived, but that brought what seemed like a gallon of sauce, so if you were really hungry you could drink the sauce. Luckily there are enough restaurants nearby so you don't have to suffer through on their restaurant, but normally we like to start out having breakfast in the hotel before we venture out. They advertise sleep number beds, but they should just have them removed and bring in normal beds. Two double beds had four controls but half the time we couldn't get the controls to work. The beds deflated somewhat over time so you had to keep adjusting them. If you wanted anything more than really soft, it basically was a round tube inflated under you, so you constantly rolled all night. There is no mini-bar or refrigerator in the room, and when asked about getting some things that we forgot to pack, they said, 'There is a 7-Eleven across the street.' Hotel doesn't even have a small gift/sundry shop. If you want a soda, you get it from the vending machine on the floor, but they use the same vending machine for candy/etc as they do for soda cans, so when you select a soda, it bangs on the front glass then onto a small ledge and shakes up so much that when you attempt to open it, it just sprays for a bit. Have never seen soda cans vended from a machine in this fashion. We have stayed at Radissons before, but none has ever come close to this level of dissatisfaction. We were tempted to leave early, but figured we would stick it our for the 4 nights and hope things would get better. They didn't and the problems at check out were just the icing on the cake.

My room was on the 20th floor (I'd asked for a high floor) and was clean, spacious and comfortable. There were two large double beds, a large TV, desk, chairs etc and the usual hotel bathroom. See my photos for a better idea. I particularly liked the coffee maker which has normal mugs and takeaway cups provided, meaning I could take coffee with me as I went out every morning. There's free wifi and wired internet throughout the hotel which suited my laptop and my smartphone, and I was impressed at how easily it worked - usually you need to go through 101 very slow confirmation screens to get onto a hotel network, but this one just worked without any hassle. As my luggage was delayed (airline didn't load my bag) I had to speak to the front desk and concierge quite a few times about having my bag delivered from the airport, where to buy new clothes etc etc, and they were always helpful and courteous. My TV remote was replaced within a few minutes when I called the front desk (the original didn't have any batteries?!). I used the express laundry service which was very efficient, and they returned my items well within the 3 hour timescale they advertise. My one bugbear was that it took almost the whole week for my in-room safe to be fixed (the previous guest had left it locked open), but they did eventually get round to doing it. The hotel is in a good location close to Copley Plaza (my course was around here and I walked there and back most days); it's also close to a \"T\" subway station which you can easily and cheaply commute around when in Boston. There are two attached restaurants (not sure if owned by hotel or not) which seem ok, and lots of smaller eateries within 2 minutes walk eg Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts etc. I didn't have much free time in Boston but I did manage to see Blue Man Group, whose theatre is around 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and there are also a few cinemas within easy walking distance.

The Radison is well run, beds are adjustable and most comfortable, there is a lovely swimming pool. We had a few problems with lack of hot water and noise -from an ice machine - Room 2024.

I wanted to share this most pleasant experience that I have had recently with your Hotel on Stuart St. in Boston. It is service like this that creates customer loyalty. This was a very special weekend stay for my partner and I as we were in Birthday Celebration mode and the Radisson certainly made it very special! I certainly know where to stay when on future travel plains. I had the absolute pleasure of being assisted by Helena Desir in the main lobby. Her outgoing, funny, accommodating, flexibility and professionalism personality was outstanding. She real dazzled us with the outstanding services provided. This experience definitely stood out as World Class Service. Coming from a Sales environment in the largest Health Insurer Company in Massachusetts we set our standards at World Class Service and have been recognized nation wide for it. I know that when I go to do my next presentation on one of the best experiences I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in Customer Service I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be sure to tell them this one. What was even more amazing was as we left everyone gave us a warm send off and even asked how the birthday celebration went. With so many people going in and out of this very large hotel we were so shocked that everyone still recognized us and not just Helena oh and Alex at the front desk too, I mean everyone! Talk about Excellence in Personalized Service! The room was gorgeous and was so impressed with the breath taking views of the John Hancock and Prudential Towers. What was even more spectacular was that there was a balcony! A HUGE PLUS that also makes the Radisson stand out over the competition as so many other hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have them. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really looking forward to my return. The staff there is amazing and all really deserve recognitions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also looking forward to sharing my wonderful experience with as many friends as possible.

The rooms were exceptionally roomy which I was surprised by, pleasantly of course. We had a standard room with 2 queen beds, flat screen television, desk, table, chairs, and your other basic hotel features; unfortunately no refridgerator, but there was a safe! This hotel offers complimentary wifi which worked very nicely! We also had a balcony with breathtaking views of Boston! The beds were sleep number and sort of tricky, but not too bad; however not the most comfortable either. The bathroom was standard, but nice and we had no complaints about it. Also Valet was about $40 per day with unlimited in/out priviledges which is really standard for anywhere in Boston. We were also told the hotel had an indoor pool and fitness center which we didn't get to use during our stay. We ate dinner one night at the restaurant adjacent to the hotel called the Rustic Kitchen which was great and also another night we ate at Legal Seafoods across the street which was okay. I highly reccomend the \"Old Town Trolley Tour\" which the concierge can help you with. It was about $35 per person, but the pass is good for two straight days and runs from 9am-5pm and will take you anywhere you want in Boston with a narrated, comedic tour that we really enjoyed! The tour also includes perks such as free admission to certain museums and exhibits as well as the Harbor Cruise which was also fabulous! Great deal for your money for sure!

The room was very clean, spacious and we even had a balcony - very rare for a City Hotel. We did not book breakfast and I can honestly say we are glad we didnt - The food around Boston is all fantastic and we were never hungry for breakfast as we ate big lunch's and dinners and snacks through the day ! We had breakfast at the Hotel on the first day as we were up early and did not know our way around the City, it is a good breakfast, plenty of choice but if you can live without it, go and explore all the food outlets around the City. The Raddison is in the best location for Tourists, it is in the Theatre District, its about a 10 min walk to the Prudential Centre, 15 min walk to Fanueil Market and Harbour area and only a couple of min's from Boston Common, the Hotel also has plenty of restaurants and pubs all nearby. Apparently there is a T stop (Underground) not far from the Hotel, but we walked everywhere. Everything we done around Boston was fantastic - From the Duck Tours to the Trolly Tour, Fenway Park Stadium Tour, Cheers bar for Lunch, Fanueil / Quincy Market and we also went for lunch at the Top of the Hub - 52nd Floor of the Prudential Building - The view is amazing !! I could write pages on our time in Boston so please, if you would like any advice from a Tourist point of view then please drop me an E Mail - All I will add is as mentioned earlier the food around Boston is amazing - Everything is so tasty, but I will say, if you like your seafood, you must go to Legal Seafoods - There are a few around the City, we went to the one opp the Raddison, we enjoyed it so much we went there twice and the first time we went there I tried the Lobster - Its amazing and half the price we would pay !!

Even though we were located right in the city center, the room was quiet and I never heard any street noise or noise from other guests. After walking around the entire city of Boston over 3 days, I came to the conclusion that this is one of the best located hotels in Boston in terms of ease of visiting various neighborhoods and tourist sites. We easily walked the entire Freedom Trail, and in the other direction we walked to Back Bay and the South End. It's also located near a couple subway stops which was convenient. Chinatown is very close by for some good inexpensive restaurants. I have two minor complaints with the hotel. The biggest one was that we never had very hot water in the shower, it was lukewarm every time we showered, no matter the time of day. Also we found the heated swimming pool to be pretty cold. But neither of these were a major problem, and overall we enjoyed our stay. The business center was awesome and allowed us to print out our boarding passes for free.

Using their free wifi to rave about this place. I can't recommend this hotel more highly! I was looking for a hotel in Boston convenient to the T and hopefully within walking distance of something interesting, without costing an arm and a leg. I got a great deal on DHR.com ($160 per night, inclusive of taxes and fees) for the Radisson, and saw it got great reviews so I decided to go for it. I'm so glad I did. The staff here is ridiculously nice and accommodating, from the doorman to the bellman to the front desk clerks. They got me a super early check-in when I arrived Thursday morning after a redeye, getting me into my room with no problem at 8am. When the internet went out at 1am, I called the front desk and the clerk was really apologetic and, since they didn't know when it was going to be fixed, immediately offered to remove our parking charge for the night to compensate me for the inconvenience, which I really appreciated. They actually got the external IT guy to talk to me to try to troubleshoot the problem (and he was also super-nice), and got it fixed within half an hour, but my parking was still comped. That's service! The woman who checked me out was extremely sweet and helpful and has been extremely accommodating as I take up space in their lobby. As is typical for downtown Boston hotels, parking is extra - $39/day self-park in a garage attached to the hotel (valet is also available for more) with in and out privileges. The location is awesome. It's only a block away from Boston Common (though admittedly, it's winter and the Common isn't that attractive right now), like three blocks from Chinatown, less than a mile's walk from Downtown Crossing and Faneuil Hall. In the other direction, I think it's also within a mile of Back Bay, but I haven't actually gone that way yet. There are a bunch of subway stops within a few blocks of the hotel - the Arlington stop on the green line is the closest at 2 blocks away, but the Tufts Medical Center stop on the orange line is only maybe 3 blocks away, Chinatown stop is maybe 5 blocks away, I walked to South Station easily, the Boylston and Park St stops are also all really close. There are a ton of restaurants close by - around the Boston Park Plaza Hotel across the street are Legal Seafood's, McCormick and Schmicks, Maggiano's Little Italy, the Melting Pot, Au Bon Pain (around the back, on the Boston Common side), Finale, Pairings, etc etc... Diagonally across the street is a food court with a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and a bunch of other food court food. As for the room itself, it was great. Big, clean, comfortable. A reasonable number of accessible outlets (which is important to me b/c I always have a half dozen things to charge and so many hotels seem to not have outlets), both wired internet and free wifi, a safe in the closet, shower with good water pressure, a balcony, etc. The beds are sleep number beds, which I've never tried before but were kind of fun to play with and comfortable to sleep on. Either no one was in the rooms around us or the room was quite well soundproofed. I could occasionally hear honking or loud honks from the street below (we were on the 10th floor) and last night, I could distantly hear a drunk man bellowing (Friday night in downtown Boston - big surprise), but for the most part it was very quiet. I heard voices once or twice when they were talking right outside my door, but there wasn't the usual array of annoying noises from adjoining rooms that I often get at hotels. Since I'm a light sleeper, this was priceless to me.

It was a surprise vacation and it was our first as well. I only chose this hotel because of it's location in the Theater District, little did I know at the time what a gem I had found. The service from the moment we checked in was nothing less than incredible. And remained to our checkout 6 nights later. We are from a small town and value friendly people, and the staff here was Great! Everyday my daughter and I were greeted by everyone in the lobby, and when we returned from our daily events, the staff was always waiting to hear from my daughter what exactly we had done. They truly made us feel at home. The front desk staff and the concierge were very knowledgeable, they knew everywhere in Boston I wanted to go. they even busted out the maps to show me where they were in relation to the hotel. The only problem we had at the hotel was a hair dryer that stopped working. I called the front office and within 5 minutes there was a housekeeper at our door with a brand new, still in the box, hair dryer. Our vacation in Boston was great, but thanks to the staff at the Radisson, it will be a vacation that will never be forgotten by my daughter or I. She is already trying to figure out the next trip to the Radisson Boston. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone...unless they aren't interested in a hotel that was very clean, comfortable, and loaded with very personable staff. ps. the \"hotel restaurant\" The Rustic Kitchen was awesome! great food, really good staff. We had dinner there on Monday night when we checked in and on Friday night when we returned, our waiter from the first night stopped to ask us how the vacation was going! Im not usually in too much of a rush to hit the hotel restaurant, but this place was a real find.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Spacious Rooms, But Just Really Noisy @ Night\u201d", "Author": "chauncey4u", "ReviewID": "UR98536446", "Content": "I purchased my hotel stay for $69 plus taxes on priceline. We live right outside of Boston 45 minutes away, and just went into Boston for a 1-night getaway with our 15-month old daughter. We checked in on a Saturday afternoon. The hotel has a valet car service for $39 per night which allows car service in and out of the hotel unlimited times. The valet attendant was very nice. We then checked in and the hotel staff was very pleasant, and check in took no longer than 5 minutes. Our room was on the 22nd floor - great view! We entered our room and it was really spacious and open - our daughter had a GREAT time playing in the room and running around - she was happy... we were happy. The beds are the \"Sleep Number\" beds - and I'm embarrased to say that we just didn't find them comfortable as we expected it to be. The pillows on the bed weren't as cozy either. We went down to the pool and though they advertise a \"heated pool\", the water wasn't warm, so we were dissapointed. We still lounged at the pool and played with our daughter. By the way, we needed a fridge in our room to keep our daughter's milk, and they put one in our room free of charge for the baby (otherwise it's $20). That was really nice of the attendant to do that when I called to request it. At night, there was a real issue of the noise outside the hotel. We could here the police and fire sirens ALL NIGHT - not much sound proofing going on. That was a bit of disturbance, so we didn't sleep sound. I will have to mention that the rooms are impeccable in terms of cleanliness. I didn't find anything that was out of place or un-clean. Overall the hotel is great - but I would have just sound proofed the rooms and wanted a heated pool.

I picked this hotel because it was close to the theater and the reviews here on TA. I think I paid $240/night including taxes but I took the deal where you paid up-front a couple months in advance and couldn't cancel. It was at least $125 more per night to book 'normally' through the hotel's website. So if you don't need the ability to cancel then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent deal to pay in advance. The hotel is pretty easy to find right off I-90 (Mass Pike). The parking is a painful $34/day self park or $39 for valet. As near as I could tell that was pretty much the going rate for the area. The lobby is small if that's important to you. Check-in was painless. The rooms were very clean (including bathrooms) and decent sized. Not fancy but certainly adequate. Flushing the toilet was louder than launching a missile however. As with other Radissons I've stayed at, this one has the ridiculous Sleep-Number beds. I can't ever seem to get these things to work and they seem to have two settings; cement and granite. That said I still managed to sleep ok. The real benefit of staying at this hotel is its location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the Back Bay close to the theaters, the common and other tourist sites. Even Quincy Market is only maybe a 20-25 minute walk. As someone else noted the hotel is plenty nice but lacks any personality. I didn't really care about that so it was perfect for me. I wouldn't stay here on my honeymoon but if you're looking for a decent place to stay at a [relatively] reasonable price in a good location this place is perfect. They have a pool and a business center but I didn't use either one so I can't comment on them. I also think they have free wi-fi though I didn't use it on this trip.

The hotel is in a nice location in the Back Bay and a great base to tour Boston. It is located in the theatre district. When checking into this hotel we didn't get much help from the guy who checked us in. He asked my name, took my credit card number and gave me my room keys. He didn't give me any info about hotel services or even directions to the elevator...it was way too abrupt. The rooms are a good size. Bathroom is a little small and the sink, because of it's design, squirts water every where when you turn it on...a real pain. And each room has a balcony which was nice, we went out on it a couple of times...would have been nice to have some chairs or something out there. The room was clean. The first night/day we didn't receive towels for the day from housekeeping...had to call and request them which I found odd. But my biggest issue with this hotel was the beds. Oh the sleep number bed. I hated it. It didn't really matter what number I put the sleep number on, it was always uncomfortable. And the walls are thin. Could hear people talking and the toilet flushing in the next room and could also hear people running on the floor in the room above. There isn't anything that stands out about this place, especially for the cost. It is also a very large hotel and always seemed crowded. Another annoyance was the elevators. In order to use the elevators, you had to use your room key...which worked only some of the time. Very annoying. On a positive note, we did go to the restaurant located in the hotel, Theatre Cafe, and the food was delicious. Beware, huge portions though.

I'm not sure why hotels cannot guarantee a room when you make a reservation 4-6 months in advance. They have your credit card, if you don't show up, you get charged for the 1st nite and they can still rent the room right? Anyway, the last 3 years have required my insistence on not taking the room they have tried to put me in and getting a room that I want. So if this happens to you? Just keep asking at the front desk until you get someone who will listen. This year, Rose was my go-to girl who was more than willing to try to find something for me as soon as I asked her. Thank you Rose! I have always found the bellmen, doormen, cleaning ladies and most of the front desk folks to be friendly and accommodating. \"Concierge\" John is always a great help and always has a smile. All rooms have a private balcony which is a plus. However, the West side of the hotel has a better view now that the 42 floor Westin has been completed. If you are going to be there over the 4th? Try to get a room on the 21-24th floor and you'll have a grand view of the fireworks and not have to deal with the 500,000 people at the Esplanade. The rooms have always been clean on all of my stays. The beds are Sleep Number beds but the pillows are a synthetic pillow that is like a rock after about 5 minutes. if you can, bring a pillow from home - I did this year and had a much better nite's sleep. My room this year also had a new flat panel TV however, for some reason, all of the channels were analog (which doesn't even exist in my part of the country anymore). Down in the bar, they were digital and in HD. Hmmm.. I didn't question as it was not that big of a deal-I wasn't there to watch TV. As far as I am concerned, the hotel is very centrally located. I usually walk anywhere from 12-15 miles a day while in the city. Most areas of the city and out to Fenway, can be walked quite easily. It is very rare that I have found the need to use any public transportation. If need be, the T can be had within a block at the Arlington Street Entrance or the Park Street Station in the Boston Common a few blocks up Tremont Street. Speaking of the T, get a Charlie card - just ask one of the MTBA workers in any station, they usually have them. It's so much easier to use. Another plus, if you decide to take the Upper Deck Bus Tour, the BeanTown Trolley or the Old Town Trolley tour, they all stop right in front of the hotel. $15.00 should get you to and from the hotel and Logan via any of the shuttles driving around Logan. If you get really lucky, you can score one for $13. Cab will cost you about $25 - ask the front door guy to get you a shuttle unless you need to leave immediately since there are always cabs waiting and a shuttle may take up to 15 minutes to arrive. Despite the problems with getting the room, or one near it, as per my reservation, I plan on returning next year. I like having a balcony. I like the location.

The hotel grew on me though. The room was spacious and light with a nice bathroom. Our balcony (which could have benefited from some chairs or something) had a good view west towards the Charles River and overlooking the pool terrace/sundeck. Our room was deadly quiet all night and we slept very well. My parents didn't do so well - their neighbours had a loud raucous party all night the first night and the hotel management didn't seem to be able to deal with it although they comped all 4 of us breakfast the next morning. We had a great view of the fireworks from our balcony which was very convenient. I wouldn't put this hotel on my top ten list, but if I was going to Boston again I would probably stay there.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT in every way & amazing downtown location!\u201d", "Author": "Stacey7733", "ReviewID": "UR71054084", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the downtown Boston Radisson for 3 nights in July and absolutely loved it! I had never stayed at a Radisson before and I'm so glad I finally did. I will never stay anywhere else again in Boston when I go home to visit. We had a great, spacious room, awesome Sleep Number bed (especially good if you and your partner like different levels of firmness, which we definitely do!), immaculate in the room and in all of the common areas, huge rooftop patio outside of the pool, and such a perfect view of downtown Boston. My boyfriend is actually a professional photographer and got an amazing shot from our balcony of Stuart St., the Boston Common trees, the gold dome at the top of the state house, and even the Zakim-Bunkerhill bridge behind that. We were on the 22nd floor on the east side of the building. The location is in the theater district which is very small so it's not like it takes you any time to get out of that neighborhood- even if you have NO plans to see a show (we didn't), this location is key for anything you want to do downtown. In reality, Boston is not a very big city and most things are walkable. From this hotel, you can walk to Back Bay (lots of amazing shopping on Newbury St. & Boylston St. and great restaurants & nightlife), Downtown Crossing (more shopping & restaurants), Chinatown, Government Center and even North End (Boston's \"Little Italy\")/Marina/Aquarium if you are up for a 20 min walk. One other key thing I want to point out: the weather was insanely humid & hot during those 3 days and the garage attendees had a cooler full of ice cold sodas, waters & gatorades to hand out to guests on their way in or out of the garage! Such a nice touch that you would never expect but appreciate so much.

The location is very good -- about 3 blocks away from Boston Common, and while the weather did not cooperate for us, you can take the Swan Boats out on the water in the Common at a very inexpensive price -- a fun, easy add-on to your trip, especially if the weather is nice and you have young children. The hotel has a restaurant which had a very nice Mother's Day brunch and buffett breakfast at an affordable price -- $16 which included omlettes made to order, as well as pancakes, in addition to the normal items on the buffet line (scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits/gravy, french toast, fruits, etc.). I believe kids under 4 eat free. The room had a great view of the city -- we were on the 21st floor -- and it had a small balcony, although I was a bit nervous about the balcony with the two kids (approximate ages 4 and 6). The room itself was a fairly decent size, especially for city accommodations. The pool is quite nice, although I did not notice a hot tub, and there were 4 or 5 exercise bikes in a separate room off the pool with glass windows looking onto the pool so a parent could work out while watching older kids swim. Also, there was a nice rooftop deck outside of the enclosed pool with tables and chairs. Parking was easy, albeit typically expensive for the City (valet price was $39). It is a bit confusing with respect to where to pull in to check into the hotel -- pull into the garage area and park to the side -- as there was a bellhop at the curb just past the entrance to the garage which lured me to drive past the parking entrance. Internet was free and the wireless connection worked fabulously in the room. The hotel was reasonably priced at $215 before taxes -- very fair for downtown accommodations, and in fact, it was one of the cheapest hotels we found in the City but for those not use to city hotel prices, it might seem a bit high. The \"T\" (or subway) is an easy 2-3 block walk so you can go pretty much anywhere in Boston.

And on this occasion, they did: Good - Front desk: Yes I know its subjective, but I dealt with them multiple times: friendly ever time (different people too before you wonder). - Location is good: in between Back Bay (5~10 min walk) and the CBD (5 ~ 10 min walk). Easy access to all of Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing tourist/historical sites - Room was clean, fresh. Beds were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beds (which may mean something to those who follow these things) I found them fine. - Not often the television selection options raise my eyebrows given I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally watch much TV (let alone when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m travelling) but if you have kids etc, options available, plus a game console if memory serves is advantageous. - Car parking: I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve have to assume a valet charge) it but it is literally under you. Handy. - I really like hotels that actually tell their guests to tell them what they want washed linen-wise. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about bedsheets etc: the fact that towels must be in the bath to get changed I think is a big step forward and should be encouraged industry wide. If I stay more than 1 night, there is no point changing 7 towels when I only use 1~2 towels and 1~2 facewashers. Obviously the lot is changed if a new guest uses the room, but these sorts of environmentally friendly actions add up in my view. Bad - A pet peeve of mine: paying additional charge for Internet access. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve written this before: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why the more expensive the hotel/motel, the commensurately more expensive the internet access. The point? You pay for it here too. - Really stretching here, but if you are arriving by train (or bus), those stations are some ways (15~20 min walk) away. I was too stingy to pay for a cab. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually open the bar fridge and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at the cost of selections available so have no view on that. Overall? A solid experience. Good front desk, clean + quiet rooms. Boston is normally for some reason an expensive city for (even basic) hotels.

We stayed at the Radisson on Stuart Street from December 29th-January 1st. I was impressed from the get go. Check in went very smoothly as we had an early flight and arrived at the hotel before noon, there was already a room available for us! (Check in is at 3pm) The hotel is located right smack in the central of downtown. We were in walking distance to just about everything we needed, a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts were just a block away for an inexpensive breakfast. There were plenty of ATM's nearby along with a couple convenient stores. The most important thing within walking distance to the Radisson was the 'T stop'. There were 3 'T stops' within a reasonable distance that can take you anywhere in Boston. There are many restaurants within walking distance along with a Legal Seafood just across the street. We frequently visited the bar/lounge at the 'W Hotel' which is directly next door to the Radisson and a block down. The rooms were very clean and accommodating. They came with a safe, sleep number beds and the bathroom was spacious enough for the both of us. My favorite feature was the small balcony with a gorgeous city view. My one and only complaint on the room is the noise level. The walls must be very thin because we could hear just about everything happening on either side of our room along with the room above us. At check out on New Years Day we were unable to catch an elevator down to the first floor for about 20 minutes. I realize this is because the hotel was busy and we had a luggage cart for our bags. 5 Elevators came and went before we found one we could actually squeeze into. We were also in the middle of the hotel on the 12th floor. TIP TO GUESTS: Try to check out before 10am so this does not happen to you. We used our Triple A Discount and were able to book a comfortable room in downtown Boston for 3 nights for just $460. I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston and I will definitely stay again if I return to Boston on vacation.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect destination!\u201d", "Author": "racerqueen3", "ReviewID": "UR52654315", "Content": "Spent New Years Eve and Day w/ husband, 2 kids and 2 kids-in-law...was close to Fenway ...

I've stayed in the Courtyard around the corner and the new W next door looks quite snazzy, but the Radisson is definitely the best value on the block. I got a great rate through my AmEx rewards program and if I can keep getting such a good deal, I'll never stay in any other hotel in town. The room was *enormous* - I had a standard room but it's bigger than so-called suites I've had in many other hotels. The King size bed was quite large and comfortable, though I'm not super excited about the sleep number bed - prefer the chains that have the heavenly bed or the tempurpedic. The living area had a couch, a comfortable work desk and separate climate controls. The bathroom was on the small size, but not uncomfortably so and the shower stall was a very good size. I was on the top floor with two giant window banks that gave a nice view of Back Bay. The room was well cleaned every day. The internet was free (yay!) but only wired. Since I was travelling for fun, I didn't check out some of the features that are important to me when I travel for work - specifically room service, the hotel restaurant and the fitness room.

You get out for another eleavtor & the one I was in closes & goes. On Sunday, one of the elevators was out of service. People were scrambling for elevators - going up when they had to go down just to get in one before it was packed. The other suggestion I have is they should charge a little less for the parking, but they may be a pipe dream since is Boston & parking comes at a premium.

I left this towel out prominently so that room service could replace it. That evening I reached for the bath towel and found they had simply refolded the one with blood stains on.

We typically stay at more high-end hotels like the Mandarin, Ritz, or Intercontinental. However, we are off to Europe next week, and we were only in town for a concert, so we decided to look for something more affordable. We could not have been more pleasantly surprised! Positives: Great location. Easy walking distance to Boston commons, Newbury St., all the major theaters, and plenty of great restaurants. Legal Seafoods, Smith & Wollensky's and plenty others are within a block or two. The rooms are large, clean, and comfortable. The bed and linens could have been at any much pricier hotel. The balcony was great for some fresh air, and great views of the park and city. Also, now that smoking is prohibited in all Boston hotels, the balcony can be handy for those who enjoy an occasional cigarette. Negatives: The outside of the building is far from appealing. The need for the use of a key card in the elevator is annoying. The bathrooms are rather small, and the water pressure in the shower was below average. Room service is ony available while the restaurant is open, which can be a bummer if you want to order a snack or drink after 11 PM. The lobby area is not very appealing, but who hangs out in a lobby at the Radisson anyhow?

This is an OK hotel but to say it's the best hotel somebody's ever stayed at (as one review does) makes me wonder what sort of places they've been staying at. On the plus side the location is good and only a 5 minute walk to the subway (toss up whether Arlington or Boylston station is closer). Rooms are a good size and are clean (although bathrooms are on the small side). We stayed on their \"Free Friday\" deal so I would say the place was good value (if I'd paid full price for both nights I wouldn't be so happy). Negatives are average service (not bad but certainly not memorable), dark dingy lobby, terrible looking building outside (the parking garage over the road has more architectural merit). And then there are the beds and air conditioning. The air conditioning units are very loud. We avoided using it the first night but it was so hot the second night we gave in and were woken up every time it came on. The unit seemed to wait until the room was really hot and then cool it until it was freezing and then start the process over again. As for the beds, I realize some people love the sleep number thing but it took us one night to realize the controls were screwed up and the left side control was actually adjusting the right side of the bed. My daughter's bed seemed to have a mind of its own; set it to one number and five minutes later it was a totally different number. Give it a week and we might have figured it out. I can only compare it to a Marriott where they have invested in good quality mattresses and avoided all the gimicky gadgets that are fine until they stop working properly. Overall, if the price was right (and it was a season that didn't call for air conditioning) I would still consider the hotel again. A couple of suggestions on eating. Fajitas & Ritas is a loud, lively, cheap choice for great fajitas and margaritas (imagine that!). Beware the portion sizes - we ordered a pile of extra sides and were ready to explode when we left the place. Stick with the basic chicken fajitas and you'll have more than enough food.

The room was spacious & of standards we'd expect with desk & free internet; the bathroom was very nice & very clean and well appointed with bright white tile. The location is just a few blocks (less than 5 minutes walk) to the start of the freedom trail where the park service provides a wonderful guided walking tour with tons of history describing the people & the times & the buildings from colonial times through revolutionary times. Our kids got a little lost with too much information but as an adult I found it fascinating to listen to stories about John Hancock, Paul Revere & Sam Adams who were long time chums. We made the walk to/from Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market & the harbor (aquarium & whale watching pier) several times during our stay. Only once did we take a cab to go out to eat & we were sorry we did; the cabby took the freeway around the perimeter of where we were going & it cost about $14 for what should have been a 15 block $6 trip. Walking is pleasant in Boston; be sure to stroll through the classy homes on Beacon Hill. Maps are readily available on counters everwhere. Our stay included Harborfest & the 4th of July Fireworks (highly recommend it). It is a short walk (about 7 blocks?) from this location to a good view of the fireworks on the Charles River between Boston & Cambridge. Everyone has to walk anywhere near this event as there are thousands of people but it was a very pleasant experience as they closed several streets to accomodate & we were in bed 15 minutes after the fireworks with no car parking issues, no crowded trains etc. The Boston Pops Music is amped up (live) throughout the park & its really neat. This hotel is as close as any to this activity. We also walked to the Copley Square shopping area near the Prudential Tower. We rented a car for travel to the coast & what we thought was an easy return drive got us a few miles out in the wrong direction as the I-90 turnpike has very limited exits. This could have been avoided had we gotten directions from a local. The pool area was nice. Pool was a little cold even for a Northern Climate family and there was no hot tub to warm up in. The pool level deck has a huge roof top sun deck that would be perfect for a spa. A similar experience at a hotel in San Antonio was made very memorable with a couple of large spas on the rooftop.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc1mxm", "Title": "\u201cGreatest July 4th @ the Radisson Hotel Boston\u201d", "Author": "nyc1mxm", "ReviewID": "UR34581429", "Content": "We planned a weekend in Boston not knowing much about where to stay.

As stated by others, the location is great, and the rooms renovated. The sheets and duvet are nice, the bathroom nice and new. We did feel the cleaning could have been better- dust along all the baseboards, fingerprints on the doors, and the carpet, while newer, was stained and dingy looking. The same unfortunate choice of beige carpeting was used in the elevator as well- and that was filthy. During our 4 night stay, it seemed our room was cleaned very quickly and not very well at that (especially the bathroom). Also- they charged us 20$ a day to have a mini fridge in the room, which seemed a little excessive to me. Why do you need to pay extra for what you get for free in any roadside motel at a fraction of the room rate? Should also note that the pool and fitness area are ridiculously small and dated. I always thought that it was a health dept. rule that you were to shower before going in a pool- but here there were no poolside showers- or change rooms! Just a small pool with peeling concrete. A few kids in there and really it was full. For the size of the hotel, the fitness center was way too small as well. Overall...well it was OK. Nice bedding, quiet rooms. Decent price. But some questionable cleaning, charges, and pool area. I do recommend a high floor, not just for the view but for the street noise as well. It would seem this hotel is en route to the hospitals, and ambulance sirens go on...and on...throughout the night. A high floor and keeping the ac fan on solves this problem nicely.

A nice feature about the hotel that isn't mentioned in the reviews is that the pool is large enough for lots of people to enjoy it, and that there are two doors off the pool to the rooftop decks where there are tables and chairs to enjoy; we saw someone doing his morning stretches out there, a nice idea. The bathrooms were clean and the supplies were nicely presented and unscented but rich.

I know it's in the guise of asking you to conserve energy and resources, but I'm on vacation, okay? :-) The breakfast buffet was yummier than I've seen elsewhere.

Parking is always dicey in Boston and having it in a package is great. Breakfast is very good. Its a buffet but it was a little different each day and the hot items were of good quality, pancakes, eggs, sausage, etc. I love oatmeal and it is very good with lots of fixins. One minor thing is that the bathrooms are tiny. I smacked my leg on the sink trying to get dressed. Sitting on the toilet, you can touch the shower curtain and the sink easily to try and give you a perspective and I'm a short man (5'6\"). Past reviews mentioned that some of the balconies are blocked and I asked about that and the answer is that they block them if high school/college age students will be using the room and sometimes they don't get in there to unblock them so if you want the balcony door to work just ask if it isn't open. Nice view especially from up high (we were on the 21st floor). Also it is a quiet hotel which you can enhance by asking for a non-connected room to the room next to it.

Great downtown location close to the T, restaurants, shops, bars, whatever you could possibly want. Rooms recently remodeled, it appeared, and nice.

My room had a balcony -- I think all the rooms have one, but I'm not sure; it was nothing special and fairly small, but it's nice to have a balcony nonetheless, and it's a rarity in downtown Boston. My only complaint is that you could hear a lot of noise from the hall inside the room. It wasn't deafening, by any means, and I wasn't awakened by it, but I did think it was odd. Pool could've been a bit warmer. And a bit deeper. The shallow end was 3 ft, and it seemed like the deep end was about 3.25 feet. But it was fine; I went swimming a couple nights. Exercise room looked nice enough; basic, but gets the job done, though I didn't try it out. The internet (complimentary) was extraordinarily slow when I arrived, but on the second night I received a note under my door saying their internet connection would be taken down that evening for upgrades to their bandwidth, and -- wow -- it made a big difference.

I was not wowed by the buffet, but it was pretty good -- and given how expensive food can be at hotels it was actually a pretty good bargain. Service was great. Very friendly staff. Early check-in was no problem, and I don't think I've ever had a quicker check-in experience, actually. They were ready for me. When I arrived, there were approximately 1 million people waiting for the elevator for a job fair that was taking place that day, and I had to wait about 5 minutes before I could actually get a place in an elevator (this only happened that first day).

The one thing I have is parking, why would a hotel not just roll that price into the price of the rooml, expect to pay the extra for the parking.

Each time, I booked the room through Hotwire for a very reasonable rate, and every time, I have been quite pleased with the quality of the room and the central location. The Radisson isn't much to look at from outside -- it looks like any other 70s-era, urban-renewal short tower -- and for that reason, I hadn't gone out of my way to stay there. However, I am glad I took a chance, as the property has become my default choice when traveling to Boston on business. The lobby and public spaces are pleasant if a bit generic -- but clean and well maintained. The staff are warm and friendly if not boutique-hotel effusive. Works fine for me. The rooms, though, have consistently been a nice surprise. They're a cut above other three-star hotels in the area, and would remind you most of a (slightly) bargain version of the newer hotels along the harbor, the Intercontinental and the Westin Waterfront. For a significant step down in price, you don't give up too much luxury. As others have noted, the property offers dual queen \"SleepNumber\" beds -- which are far from the gimmick I expected and are very comfortable indeed. The other furnishings are also good-quality and nicely designed. Only the technology -- an older 27\" tube-type TV (free HBO) and wired internet (slow on the occasions I have tried to use it) are noticeably lower in quality than the next tier hotels. The Radisson is located in Boston's small theater district, close to the Common, and an easy walk from Newbury Street.

Really, you're paying for the amazing location, not because it is an over-the-top hotel or anything. But, for the $210 a night, it was worth it and this hotel would be my first choice if I ever have the opportunity to go back to Boston! We stayed 7 nights, but weren't in the hotel long enough to enjoy some of the amenities - didn't go to the pool even once - there's just so much to do in the city! The staff is friendly and check-in was super easy. If you book from a third-party site, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use their online check-in system, but it really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long in the hotel. Maybe 5 minutes. Our room was on the 21st floor - pretty basic hotel room, but very clean and well-maintained. Like a previous reviewer, I think the bathroom had been recently updated. The tile and fixtures looked brand-new and remarkably clean. There was plenty of counter space, but the sink, toilet, and shower are all in one room; however, they really thought through people getting ready in the morning because in addition to the giant mirror in the bathroom, there were two more giant mirrors with outlets nearby in the room. The sleep number bed was great. My friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed was really comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mine I think was broken \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it was just me in the bed, so I slept in the middle anyway! Every room has a balcony - our only wish was that there had been chairs or something to sit on outside to enjoy the spectacular view of the Prudential building and others. Just amazing. The hotel had free internet access and a free safe in the closet to store valuables. There was a small counter with coffee pot and ice bucket with a large space below to store luggage or whatever. No refrigerator. Ice bucket and soda vending machine just down the hallway. The room was cleaned every day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bedding is changed every 3 days unless you ask for it to be changed more often \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they still made the bed and cleaned up. The hotel is barely two blocks from a T station (took us less than 5 minutes to get to Boylston T station), within walking distance to - well - everything, and there are multiple restaurants just outside the door. Like other reviewers have said, there is a food court just down the street called City Place, where you also go to book/arrive for Gray Line tours. There is a 7-11 just around the corner, along with a Dunkin Donuts, California Pizza Kitchen, and Cold Stone Creamery. Legal Sea Foods and Finale are both excellent nearby choices for a great meal! Breakfast at the hotel can be expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we solved that with bagels from Dunkin Donuts and peanut butter and jelly from 7-11! Helped us spend money for amazing meals elsewhere! :-) The number of things you can do in the city is just immeasurable. Being there for 7 days, I thought for sure we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d run out of options, but we left wishing we had more time! I can't review everything here, but I will in time, so hopefully they're helpful! I can't wait to go back!!", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Loved the Hotel\u201d", "Author": "hate2clean640", "ReviewID": "UR18660553", "Content": "Our family stayed in this hotel from July 28-August 3, 2008. We picked this hotel because they let you reserve a room on their website with 5 people in a room, because of the reasonable price and because of the great location, in the theater district, near the parks and subway. We had 2 adults and 3 children, one of them in a crib. I checked the hotel rates a week before we left at the Radisson website and got an even cheaper rate with no cancellation penalty. We paid an average of just under $200 a night. The room was average size with a balcony, we had room 2007 on the 20th floor, with a wonderful view of the Back Bay skyline and the John Hancock building. The room was very quiet when the balcony sliding door was closed. The bathrooms were pristine and clean, looked like brand new tile and fixtures, the shower was the rainfall type shower head, wonderful. The bellmen and concierge were helpful with everything from finding a drugstore and a cab to finding a screwdriver so we could change batteries in a toy. Our toilet had a problem one day and a building engineer was in our room within 5 minutes and had it fixed in 10 minutes. The other reviews were accurate in describing the nearby food court and 7-11 convenience store, both in the adjacent block. We were only a few blocks from China Town as well. I recommend Legal Seafood across the street as well as Finale, an outstanding dessert restaurant in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel building 2 blocks away. Also in the nearby City Place food court is the Gray Line office, from which we booked BeanTown Trolley Tours and a Gray Line All-day Cape Cod Tour.

I was pleasantly surprised to find they had a room available. Check-in was quick and cordial. I got to my room on the 9th floor and found it as it should be- clean, up-to-date and comfortable. The view was of the indoor pool and treadmills in the fitness center on the floor below. The bathroom was large enough, with the sink inside the bathroom, however, there was only an inch between the door and the toilet. I found that odd, since the bathroom was large enough- it's the placement that was off. The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious. There were two easy chairs and a table, in addition to the desk, two beds, and chest with a TV. There was a coffee pot with coffee, but no refrigerator or mini bar. I locked myself out of the room and handbag in. Security came immediately and let me in, then checked my ID to make sure I wasn't going into someone else's room. He was serious about the id, looking at it carefully. In the morning the elevators were terribly slow. Management needs to put in a service elevator as clearly a major part of the problem was room service and housekeeping taking up a huge amount of space in the elevators. Going down, then back up, there were two waiters with large trays, one person with an enormous laundry cart, and one woman in a Radisson desk uniform pushing past others to get on the crowded elevators. Shouldn't happen. The morning elevators were my only complaint about the hotel. I had to wait with a dozen or more people for more than five minutes for an elevator. The hotel is located across the street from a small food court that included a California Pizza Kitchen, a Dunkin Donuts, as well as about 10 other restaurants/fast food places. The hotel had a restaurant, but I did not use it. Their menu prices were quite reasonable for Boston.

The ONLY ID the bars/shops/restaurants/hotels will accept is a local drivers licence, US forces ID or passport. You can't even select a bottle of spirits in the liquor store, it's kept in a roped off area for staff only.

We switched to the Radisson as we'd been given a special rate for a wedding we were attending in Boston at the Hilton, which was not valid for 30-31 Dec and the Radisson was approx. $50/night cheaper for those 2 nights. The hotel building is incredibly ugly from the outside, it's a high rise (20+ floors) grey concrete structure, built probably in the 1950's. The interior is fine though, however the lobby has an odd feel as it has 3 seperate outside entrances to it. Our room was on the 16th floor and was huge. On entering the room you walked down a narror corridor into a spacious sitting area with sofa, armchair, TV, desk etc and then on into the bedroom area. The bathroom however was tiny, definitely the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. It had a toilet, sink and shower crammed in - when you got out of the shower you practically crashed into the sink! It was quite strange that in such a large room the bathroom was so inadequate and was definitely a bit off putting. The room itself was clean and we were given a couple of bottles of free water which was nice. The loction of the hotel was good, just off Boylston St and approx. 15 mins walk from the shops at Copley Place. We didn't really come into contact with any staff, so can't really comment on that. All in all the Radisson was fine. We'd been at the Hilton for 3 nights previously and much prefered that so the Radisson was probably a bit of a let down for us.

Now, please be advised this room was next to the elevator and if paying very detailed close attention, this noise may bother you. But, as a teacher (we have a high tolerance of noise) and not spending a lit of time in the room itself, it did not bother us. It had a beautiful bathroom, spotless with an open glass shower, no bathtub. the living room extension had a tv cabinet with a small love seat and desk. This room comes with not 1, but 2 balconies. Score! In the bedroom area, it had a huge King bed, white heavenly linens, another tv! 2 night stands and drum roll.... a second balcony. Now, back to the noise... HINT- this side of the hotel (facing the Wang center) is a little noisy due to the construction that is going on. The other side of the hotel, facing the prudential building is a tad quieter, and the views, I think are better, but we were offered this suite and it was great! Had one drink at the Theatre Cafe that was frowned upon in the previous review. We did not have any issues with the staff, but the beer was a little flat. The pool is nice. The workout room is adequate, but Radisson should consider upgrading their equipment. This hotel is in the theatre district. Casual restaurants/bars to check out in walking distance are the Rock Bottom Brewery, Beantown Pub, Remingtons, Jacob Wirths, and the intimate Intermission Tavern. Walking distance to the Boston Commons/ Washingon St. and even Fanuiel Hall. The best part of this New Years Eve was watching the firework show at the Commons from our balconies!!!

Use of the hotel PC to access the Internet just to check on soccer scores and F1 race (not on USA sports channel) was extortionate. With PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costing little more than a few hundred dollars it should be free, not $30 per hour. Same with phone calls. All other motels I used during our trip I could make a short (10-15min) interstate call to my friends in USA for free. Same call at Radisson $23 !! Big Rip Off. Then there was in bottled water. In a room charged at over $200 per night they want to charge extra for each small bottle of mineral water that you use after arrival. Even Bigger Rip Off !

For the most part we were very pleased but did expect a little more for our rate of $259/night. However, the Red Soxs were in town and we expected to pay a little more because of that. We used their \"Express Check-In\" which allows you to check in early (up to 1 week in advance). However, for a minute or two the hotel desk clerk was confused even though we were standing right next to the sign for Express Check-In and were trying to hand in the confirmation paper the website has you print after you've checked in online. Once he realized where our information was he just handed us the room key and we were on our way. We had room 1007, which has two queen beds (we had requested a king bed but they were out of those rooms), entertainment center/dresser, night stand, desk with chair, two other armchairs and another round table, and a large closet. The balcony was nice but we didn't really have a view of anything, However it was convenient to be able to check the weather before heading out. Our bathroom appeared to be fairly new and was done in stark white and modern fixtures. One bathrobe was provided. We barely ever heard our neighbors and we were very happy that we didn't constantly hear doors slamming like you do at many other hotels. We found the sleep number bed very comfortable although loud when turning up the firmness. Housekeeping did a great job everyday and never disturbed us until after we left in the afternoon. We ordered room service twice and it was delicous both times - both the breakfast items (belgian waffle, pancakes, fresh fruit) and lunch items (omellette, turkey club sandwich). Both times the food arrived quickly. It's a little pricey but worth it in my opinion for the convenience of being able to eat in your pajamas! The fitness center is small but has enough equipment and free weights to have a good workout. We found the staff to be pleasant for the most part and helpful when asked anything. Our location was great and we were able to walk everywhere - to Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, Boston Common and other Freedom Trail sites, the waterfront, tons of shops and restaurants, bars and clubs.

After booking 3 rooms on Priceline.com, there was a huge mix up upon check -in. My friend was trying to be funny and booked 3 rooms and using funny alias's as our last names. Upon check-in, we realized that this going to be a problem. We take full responsiblity for causing a headache for the front desk but it was how they handled the situation that started our stay with The Radisson off on the wrong foot. First of all, there were 5 of us in our group, each of us in our 40's, and all of us work in the hospitality industry. We have the upmost respect for anyone that works in the industry and were definitely not trying to be difficult. The front desk was rude, condescending and insincere in trying to resolve the problem. We nicely offered them the option that if this situation is going to be a major problem we would just cancel the reservations and find another hotel. (No hard feelings, we would just move on) The five of us could not be more laid back. The response we got from the Front Desk,\" Fine, but you still have to pay for the rooms because they were booked on Priceline.com.\" They could not have cared less about trying to resolve the problem. Finally, we contacted Priceline.com and had a letter faxed over and eventually we were able to head to our rooms. Even after all of this headache, we chalked it up to the girl at the front desk having a bad day! No problem, we are in Boston to enjoy ourselves, not let some inadequate staff member ruin our weekend. After returning from a nice dinner and a night on the town in beautiful Boston, we were back at the hotel and taking the elevator up to our rooms. We were joking in a very nice way about not wanting to upset the front desk staff member. On the elevator with us was an employee of the hotel. Once we stepped out of the elevator and headed down the hallway, this employee actually stepped out of the elevator and started making sarcastic comments to us!! We were absolutely stunned by the lack of professionalism of this staff. The next day, four of us checked out and headed out of town. About 45 minutes later, we were trying to call our friend that stayed behind and realized that his cell phone was turned off. So, we called the hotel and asked to be connected to his room. They had no listing for our friend! So, we told them the room number and explained that we checked out about an hour ago. After being on the phone with them for about 3-4 minutes, they told us that he checked out. About 45 minutes later, our friend calls us from the hotel lobby telling us that he is getting ready to check out of the hotel. We told him that we had been trying to get in touch with him but the front desk told us that he had checked out already!! (Which he didn't!!) So then we figured, maybe we called \"the wrong\" Radisson. So, we call back and ask ed, \"Is this The Radisson on such and such street?\" They actually gave us attitude over the phone for asking for their location!!!!!!!!!! I am not making any of this up!!!!! That is when all of us had enough of this miserable staff at The Radisson. I have never written a letter of complaint to any hotel, restaurant, or any other type of service industry business. I sent an e-mail to The Radisson explaining my dissatifaction with my stay and received this cookie cutter letter of an apology mostly defending \"the normal\" behavior of this staff.

We got breakfast and parking included in our room rate, so that made things easier. We just parked our car there and left it there during our stay. We never needed it. The breakfast was pretty good. They had bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, little rolled up tamale sort of things, biscuits & gravy, oatmeal, cold cereals, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, pastries, juices.. A nice start to the day. Their breakfast hours were pretty long, which is nice. I think it went from 6am t0 11am during the week and then until noon on weekends.

I only live about 45mins from Boston but its a long drive home after hitting up the bars. I was searching more for location than amenities. A friend was arriving at Logan and we didnt want her to have to spend a lot of money for a taxi to the hotel (according to the RAD's site, Logan is 3 miles away but still cost her $17 in fare). We also picked it based on its location to the local bars/night activity. It is located right in the theater district so if your going to see the Blue Man group this is within walking distance. I made this reservation on the phone with the front desk. The woman was very polite and informative. The transaction went without a hitch and she was able to give me the online discount. The hotel was very easy to get to from the Ma Pike. I fear getting lost on the many one way streets and dealing with rabid taxi drivers! Once we pulled in to the tiny entrance area a valet driver quickly unloaded our bags and took the car away. Check in took exactly 2 mins. With a license and credit card verification we were off to our room on the 19th floor.....however we carried our bags to our room. The room was beautiful and clean. The bathroom was small but modern and bright. The tub was huge and my boyfriend even took the opportunity to soak for awhile! Everything the website said would be in the room was in fact there....including the hairdryer which came in handy as I forgot mine. Upon entering however, the room was a stagnant 82degrees. With the AC turned on high the thermostat never went below 77, but it was still comfortable. The beds looked like they were fit for a king, complete with down comforters! No cheesy or stained top blankets from the 70s! BUUUTTTT...... the sleep number bed wasnt all that great. Its an overpriced air mattress and wasn't to my liking. Maybe sleeping solo would have proved more comfortable, but I felt every movement from my partner. Now when those infomercials come on I can change the channel and not feel like I'm missing out on the latest and greatest bed craze! The breakfast buffet was great! Everything was hot and tasty... a nice way to recharge after a long night! The biggest draw back of this hotel was the price. I recently came back from a trip to Mexico where I stayed in a 4 star all-inclusive resort for 7 days. For the price of one night in Boston I could have gone back to MX for 4! After taxes my bill was $317~ no room service or additional add-ons! Needless to say it took the wind out of my sail till I made it to CHEERS for a beer....then I forgot out the chunk taken out of my wallet! For the price we paid I think the bell boy could have atleast taken the luggage to the room! Would I stay here again, sure....If I won the lottery.

However, with my company booking travel, I sometimes have no choice in where I stay, and that is how I ended up at the Radisson in Boston. And boy am I glad I did! In the past my favorite hotels in Boston have been the Doubletree downtown, and the Tremont (currently owned by Courtyard by Mariott). But the Radisson blows them away. The rooms are a beautiful size, with balconies, and both a desk area and a sitting area. Additionally, there is a small shelf in an alcove just inside the door for the coffee machine and ice--a nice touch that other hotels would do well to adopt. I'm always frustrated by having to have my coffee machine on my desk or in my bathroom. The only thing that would improve the room would be a small fridge & microwave--with all the great restaurants downtown and a week long stay, I had a lot of leftovers that I would love to have kept and reheated for snacks. The bathroom seemed almost new, with an extraordinarily deep tub, and hallelujah, a bathrobe--again, a simple touch that ups the class of the room several notches.

We booked through expedia for convenience and the hotel portion of the vacation price meant our rate was $192 a night. Firstly the practical things everybody wants to know. We thought the room was of generous proportions, the furnishing were in good condition and housekeeping did a good job. We found the sleep number bed very uncomfortable though, it was as if it has been adjusted too many time and was full of lumps and bumps. We also had an extemely small bathroom, I could easily touch opposite walls simultaneously and it made for a very small bath. That said, it was a nice bathroom and I didn't dislike it. I didn't really like the public areas of the hotel, the reception was gloomy and the lifts were slow and nasty looking. However this is probably not a big deal as obviously we spent little time here. So why have I rated this terrible? This is service related and stems from the fact that I booked through Expedia. It seems that Radisson have a poor opinion of such guests and if you book through them you have to expect to be treated as a lower class of guest and a very low priority. When we booked our hotel, two months in advance I asked for a king room and certainly I assumed this was what I was booking. When we got to our room we found it was a twin but the Radisson staff pointed out that in the small print this was only a request and not guaranteed, indeed I found this was the case. But I did order two months in advance so I asked if this could be accommodated anyway and I also advised that this was our wedding anniversary. What followed was the most unbelievable outburst you can imagine. I was essentially told that I had booked via expeida so was a low priority guest and could not expect to be treated like other guests who had booked with them directly. I was told this by three members of staff independently and none of whom made any effort to explain the situation in any terms other than to make me feel like I was a parasite, the type that wants something for nothing and then has the cheek to complain! The third person even told me to call expedia and get them to find me another hotel if i didn't like it. Considering I had been nothing but polite and diplomatic, althought certainly assertive, this was an extraordinarily rude and unhelpful suggestion. Further I was told they always \"have this problem\" with people who have booked with Expedia or Hotels.com to boot. Well what problem exactly? That people who have paid $192 a night, which actually is NOT a cheap rate, would like to get the room they ordered. If they always refuse it then I am sure they always have this problem, but it is of their making and not the guests. So note to Radisson. This is the 21st century, get used to internet bookings and if you don't like guests who book through the internet then the answer is very simple, don't take them.

Traveller Tip: While flagging a cab to return to the airport, a van pulled up and it cost me $14.50. It was the last stop before the airport. On my arrival I went with a private car and it cost me $35.00 and I was told a taxi would be $25-$30. Unfortunately I didn't get the name of the company, but forgo a taxi and use one of these shuttle vans. I'm sure the hotel can be of service. I will definitely stay here on my next trip requesting a room a few doors down from the one I had to avoid the elevator noise.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cLoved the View and Attention from Staff\u201d", "Author": "novice_explorer", "ReviewID": "UR5921165", "Content": "We stayed four nights at this hotel and enjoyed every one of them.

We found we liked it better than the views we discovered from the 52nd floor of the Prudential Tower. A full-size closet to hang our clothes, a full length mirror, beds with adjustable firmness settings, an above-average bathroom, and a balcony made this a great place to stay. Even with all that, the thing that made our stay the most enjoyable was the bell staff. Immediately upon our arrival our bags were loaded up and delivered to our room. In my experience, usually you have to wait a bit for someone to be summoned to assist you. That was not the case here. At our departure, the bellhop quickly hailed us a cab and loaded our luggage even as he was busy assisting a group of about 20 with transportation. Any time we needed service from any department it was met with promptness, courtesy, and a smile. The location was also excellent as we were able to walk to shopping, eating, and tourist spots. It was also a pick up/ drop off point for the trolley, which is a great way to see the area, especially on a slightly rainy day.

The most important things for us in this search was location and parking. Having never been to Boston, and hearing lots of stories about the traffic, we wanted to be in the thick of things and able to walk the city. The Radisson is in heart of the theater district, which is also pretty central to the entire city. It's location was great, for everything we did. We weren't more than a 10-15 minute walk from all the major food and touristy things. But the thing to really make it great was that we didn't have to worry about our car and parking too much. We found the hotel, and parked, and that was it! The room rate that I got included the parking fee - which can run you around $20 bucks a day at a public/private garage, or even on the street (but good luck finding that one). We got a rate of $199 a night off of their website, Internet rate deals, the package included the parking. Great deal - for Boston prices and parking. I did a lot of searching, and you can get a better deal if you go to a place that doesn't include parking, and is a little bit more out of the way - maybe 165 or so....Having a toddler and wanting to not worry about the parking situation - the extra money was well worth it to me. The room we stayed in was newly renovated, seemed brand new to me. Fresh , clean , brand new fixtures in the bathroom. The room had 2 of those new Select Comfort beds which was a nice bonus. The sheets were soft and comfortable, cotton and not that weird polyester bed spread that most hotels have as a standard. Down comforter to boot, and a balcony that looked out into the city. The pool and gym were adequate, we got some decent time in during the dinner time hour when most people were out. The only thing that was a little difficult was that they have a set of hotel elevators, and separate parking garage elevators. We couldn't figure out if they connected or not - the problem was there were a few stairs to manuever up/down with our luggage, stroller, and toddler...so it was a little bit inconvenient, but definitely not any kind of show stopper.

Also the Boylston subway stop(Green line) is a 4-5 minute walk -a good way to/from airport. Good range of restaurants in the area from Bennigans to upscale Bonfire.

We had a room on the 15th floor facing West which was a view of the Prudential Tower and John Hancock building. If staying at this hotel request a high floor (above 14) with a West view. The balcony was very nice and the children liked to go out and watch over the pool area and also read. Overall the best thing about this hotel is the location. We were able to walk to the Boston Commons, Chinatown, the T and we actually walked to Quincy Market & Faneuil Hall one day. The walk to Quincy Market took about 15-20 minutes, but it was a very leisurely pace down Stuart to Tremont, then one block over to Washington. Washington is a major shopping area with the renowned Filene's Basement. From Washington, take a right on Court/State Street and you can see Quincy Market. The other great thing about this hotel is the pool. There are not many hotels in Boston that have a pool and although this one is not \"outside\" the rooftop deck area provide plenty of light in the pool area. We used the pool every afternoon for about 2 hours in between morning tours and dinner plans. During our stay we went on the Duck Tour, which was entertaining, however I won't do this again. The last time we were in Boston we did the trolley tour which was much better because you were able to get off at various locations and then reboard. If your Con'duck'tor on the duck tour is not entertaining, then the ride is not that much fun. The kids were really bored after the initial \"splash\" down into the water. We also toured Fenway Park. This is a must do even if you are not a baseball fan. This was probably the best bang for the buck - $12/adult. You get to sit in the green monster seats and in the press box. One evening for dinner we went to the North Shore (Italian area). We took the T to the Haymarket station and then we got lost! The concierge did not mention how to get to the area once you got off the T. So we started out in the wrong direction, stopped somebody on the street and then found our way over to Hanover street. What a choice of restaurants. There are so many it is really difficult to choose. There was one place called Giacomo's (sp?) that we stopped at because there were a lot of people standing outside. When we asked how long the wait, the one guy told us that he lived around the corner and that this was the best place on the block. He said they tell everyone 20 minutes, but even if it is 40 minutes, it is worth the wait. Unfortunately for us, it was already 7:40 and the kiddos were hungry so we couldn't wait. If you go, please place a review to let us know if you liked it! Back to the room- the room was a decent size for a family of 4. We weren't in the room that much so it never got too small. The bathroom was adequate. The counter was really low, I'm 5'7\" and It only came up mid-thigh. I felt like I was really bending to wash my face. Also, the counter surface was very old. There was a hair dryer and a small coffee maker, but we made a Dunkin Donuts run every morning for coffee - there is DD across the street (and it seems like one on every corner in Boston - they have the BEST coffee). What we found is that if you leave $5 on your first day for the housekeeper you get pretty good service for the week. We did leave more on our last day, but I think it always helps to leave a little something in the beginning of the stay. Hope this was helpful.

After a process of trial and error, we realized that the elevator was mailnly responsible for the noise. I always ask for a quiet room when booking a hotel room.

I had students trapped on the 16th floor, unable to access an elevator for over an hour. When I phoned the front desk to ask them about the situation, their initial reply was \"We've dedicated two of our elevators to a group of 90 who are checking out...\" Since we WERE the group of 90, I knew this was a fabrication!

That's always a plus to me, as I don't like to use air-conditioning in most hotels; it's usually full of mold and aggravates my allergies. The room decor leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms are dark and rather dingy. The beds are adequate and the rooms adequately equipped. They have above-average toiletries. The coffee provided isn't particularly good and the coffeemaker is itsy-bitsy. The soundproofing's not too bad, but you do hear a bit too much of people passing in the hallways and doors slamming, which I hate. They accommodated my request for a high floor, quiet room (I request that in every hotel). The coffee shop is above average. The service varies wildly depending on who you get. I'd requested early check-in because I was flying in sleepless on a red-eye, and this was not accommodated; in fact, I couldn't check in until almost 4 p.m. Some of the desk clerks can be quite brusque. The bell captain, on the other hand, bent over backward to try to help out, storing my luggage for me, etc. Because the hotel was packed to the gills the week I was there, the service was more rudimentary than perhaps it would normally be. I wasn't able to get bellhop or concierge assistance during my stay; they were just too busy. Security was very good. High-speed internet access is available, but costly ($10 per day), and don't try to get help with the hookup. I fixed the initial problem with my hookup myself, but I've been a server administrator for 20 years. I don't know that a regular user would have been able to get connected without help. I waited on the tech support line for about 20 minutes while I was trying to fix the problem myself, and did finally resolve the issue while I was on hold. I never got an actual person on the line before I fixed it. If I'd been a normal user, that would have been pretty frustrating, I think. Hotel staff knows nothing about how to do the hookup; it's a third party company that does the support. Room service is disappointing; very expensive and the food is not particularly good. It also took a long time to get the food. Overall, for the price, a little disappointing, but not bad. By the way, don't judge the hotel by its outside appearance; it looks like a prison block from the outside, but it's nicer than that.", "Date": "January 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBest Buy\u201d", "Author": "m0nec1a", "ReviewID": "UR3080456", "Content": "I stayed at the Radisson Boston in mid January. It is in walking distance of theatres (live and cinema) a comedy club, great restaurants and the subway (called the \"T\"). The rooms are very spacious, the beds are comfortable, and the maid service is top notch. Ask for a room away from the elevator because its quite loud. Its best to get a room facing the Hancock building - the view will be awesome. Their restaurant, called the Theatre Cafe, has great food, but it is a little pricey. Breakfast will be about $15.00 for one person. The workout room faces the swimming pool. All are enclosed in glass so you see a great view of the city, but it also means that if you're swimming, the folks in the gym get a view of your rear. The only minuses I can think of is that the business center only has two computer terminals, and its about 10 dollars for 15 minutes to use the Internet. There's also no fridge, microwave or VCR in the rooms. If you're traveling to Boston, there's no need to rent a car. Just take the \"T\" everywhere. You can take shuttle #33 at Ground Transportation at Logan to the \"T\" subway. The Arlington or Boylston stop are closest to the Radisson.

The room we were initially given although very nice, was next to the lifts which were just too noisy. We were moved almost immedately, so full marks for that! The location was OK but it should be mentioned, there have been problems recently within the Theatre District where specifically, tourists have been targetted leaving theatre's or walking alone back to hotels. I think it's wise just to be aware that this problem exists here as it does in every large city. Back to the review. A couple of negatives. No one seemed to shower before using the pool even after working out in the attached gym, very un-hygenic. The charges to use the Hotel's internet facility are obcene, $9.00 for 15 minutes. And you may be staying in a large branded hotel chain in a major US city, but that does not give you the right to ask for a drink from the bar once closed (it was 00:30), regardless whether the TWO reception staff are busy chatting about boyfriends or not...Can you believe that? I've stayed in many Radissons around the world and never before been refused a drink as a guest, maybe I've just been lucky!

We had 2 dogs and paid $20 per night extra ($10 per dog) The dogs were better guests than the others staying at the hotel. I could write a full page but will try to keep it somewhat brief. The room was okay, they try to do a good job but can't. Its in a horrible neighborhood especially during the night. Its a crack prostituteneighborhood. How do I know. while parking in a very tight back lot, we bumped a guest's car. No damage, however, he was a mental case, having seen him every evening shadow boxing in the back along side his car. His car was a junker, full of crap. i don't know what he wanted since he had no damage, but before it was over, the police were there at my request. They were on drug patrol in the area. They made a report and that was the end of it, we checked out the following morning with apologies from management. The other guest was a regular long stay. I have patronized Motel 6 properties for many years. Some are good, some are horrible. Its not the company, its the people who stay there. Losers, boozers, drug addicts, prostitutes. You name it and they are there. Unless you are tough, try to find another place. This place allows dogs which makes it easy to stay but there is a price you pay and I don't mean in dollars. Walk around the neighborhood in the morning. You'll see more bars than in San Quentin Prison. Res Ipso Loquitor. the thing speaks for itself. I have to laugh when I see foreign visitors write complimentary reports. If this is what they think about it, then their standards in Europe must be pretty junky and low.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pisa, Italy", "Title": "\u201cDon't DO IT\u201d", "Author": "Ste S", "ReviewID": "UR119937859", "Content": "The worst motel I've never slept.

The furniture was ok but the sheets had cigarret burns in them and the shower curtain was broken. There was a cocaroach on the ceiling we thought was dead but moved on the 3 day.

There was free (unlike many other places) internet that worked well and fast so I could stay in touch with my office and parking was not an issue. It advertises a pool, but it is so small it is of limited use. This is not the kind of place that will entertain you but it can be used as a place to sleep, shower and kick back for awhile.

She immediately called me and told the night manager that she needed another room due to her asthmatic condition, that could not tolerate the smell of this room. She was yelled at, and told that another room would cost her double. When she advised she could not stay at this motel, this so called night manager, that only identified himself as Peter, but refused to give his last name, yelled at her, cursed her, used profanity towards her, and refused to allow her to leave the premises unless she signed the receipt. When she called me again, she was crying and near a panic. I talked to this guy and told him I would call the police if he did not release her immediately, and he hung up on me. When I was finally able to re-contact my fiancee on her cell phone, she was already driving away from this motel, and was having a asthmatic and panic attack from the abuse that she received from this night manager. I told her to book another upscale motel that I had looked up and she stayed at this Best Western for the night, instead, paying three times the cost. This motel is not only located in a drug infested area, but appears to be a drug infested location, so the management and owners get away with yelling and abusing their customers, without interference from the authorities. This information along with a formal complaint is being made to the city of Los Angeles, and the County of Los Angeles, Department of Consumer Affairs, for the abuse that my fiancee suffered at the hands of this guy \"Peter\" who refused to give his last name, plus he forced her to sign a credit card receipt, when she bolted out of this Dump.

I got to deal with a back problem and our Bell St. Motel 6 was there for us...Helpful, clean, great staff and management. In the last 9 months it at times seemed like my second home 250 miles from my actual living facility (45 ft M/V Sea of Cortez, Sonora, MX). We joked like a bad penny I kept coming back...but the facility is very well located to fwy and needs of folks seeking medical treatment in Phoenix plus all the wonderful shopping areas too. These folks provide secure & safe comfort when one is not at their best...the facility is constantly being upgraded and I can walk around at any hour and feel safe. Mrs M. E.

The pool was probably the most sparkly-clean pool I've ever been in ~ wonderful! ~ except the hot Phoenix sun made it almost too warm to enjoy. The staff was very good and went out of their way to make things right. I stayed in a non-smoking room but the stale smell of old cigarette smoke is still in there; wouldn't recommend this if you are very sensitive to the smell. This Motel 6 is nothing special but it's certainly worth the money if you need to stay in the immediate area.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cThis was--hands down-- the worst Motel 6 EVER.\u201d", "Author": "chardowning", "ReviewID": "UR65337667", "Content": "I agree 100% with the other posters...My husband and I had just gotten into Phoenix and we had to spend the night somewhere before we signed apartment paperwork in the morning. Whenever we travel, we always check availability at Motel 6 first because it's a good place to lay your head for a night or two.... but this, by far, was the worst Motel 6 we've ever stayed at. The outside of the motel is run down, unkept and unclean. The sides of the building and sidewalks were filthy with trash and stuck on food and whatever else... The next nightmare was the room: very very unclean. The floor looked like it had not seen a vacuum in more than a few months; There was dirt, crumbs, debris and trash all along the baseboards of the walls; there was hair in the trash, all over the sink, on the floor, etc.; the room was supposed to be non-smoking but there were ashtrays and burn holes everywhere (carpet, bedspread, etc.); the room had a weird odor that was not clean. My husband insisted that we stay here because it was cheap. I wanted to sleep in the car, but the parking lot was not a safe-looking place either with all its creepy strangers and domestic disputes. Luckily I had a sheet and pillow of my own in the car and managed to get to sleep. 3 hours after getting comfortable, I hear thecard slot in the door and the door was pushed open! We had the latch covering the door so he couldn't come all the way in... but it woke us up. He said we werne't supposed to be in the room and then he left. This was followed by a very rude phone call from the front desk asking us for our \"information\" and name because she didn't have anyone registered in the room. (We'd been there since 2pm that afternoon!) Never once during the call did she apologize for the \"inconvenience\"... nothing. PLEASE STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

It was only $200 a week and close to work. Big mistake. The lowest of the low lifes live there. Drug dealers, prostitutes and criminals were my neighbors. I have since moved into a nice place down the street and drive by it occasionaly and I must say it hasn't changed much in the last 4 years. If you need a nice secure place to stay head further east down bell road closer to scottsdale.

I assume that was a drug dealer, I feared for my safety, and am glad to have survived. I just remembered the door would only unlock once, then northing. The manager showed me you had to roughly shake the door to make the lock work. Jeez. And in the parking lot, this dude tells me (I'm in a car I just picked up), that the adjacent pickup has 3 !! babies in it, and no one else. After a little discussion on how bad that is (as I clench my gym bag against me, I suggest he tells the desk clerk. He then walks to a corner and waits for awhile. He finally leaves.

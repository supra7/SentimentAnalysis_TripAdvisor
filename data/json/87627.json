First we were sent to our room and it wasn't cleaned yet. Had to wait an hour in the lobby before it was ready. And when we got in there, there was stuff all over the floor and just not as clean as i would have expected. Next, the air conditioning did not work. I know its March, but it was 84 outside and even though it looks like you have your own temp controls, you dont. Also, our toliet didn't flush! When we called down to tell them the phone was not plugged into the jack. Low and behold there was a reason why...the phone wouldnt stop ringing! So we had a 85 degree room, no phone and no toliet!!!!!!!!! Went down on our way out to dinner to let them know, they said it would be fixed by the time we got back (the phone and toliet). They NEVER came and fixed it. One night at 179.99 plus tax wasn't worth it. We will NEVER come back here and we will NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muskegon, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cHot and dirty\u201d", "Author": "CindyR49441", "ReviewID": "UR126305643", "Content": "Ruined, what would have been a really fun weekend. We booked 2 Superior king suites. It was unseasonably warm for St. Patrick's day weekend, but unfortunately, there is NO \"climate control\", as the Internet stated.Our room ranged from 80-85 degrees and all of the windows are sealed shut. Multiple complaints got us nowhere because the entire hotel temperature can only be \" switched\" seasonally. Even though they were completely booked, they would not do the \" switch\". Next, our room was filthy. There was debris in several corners that were not vacuumed. Upon removal of the cushions to the sofa sleeper, a bunch of crumbs, debris & cellophane wrappers were found & we chose NOT to sleep on it. A supervisor insinuated that we, might have dirtied it. Even though this hotel is inexpensive, the minimum I expect, is cleanliness!!! The ONLY thing, this hotel, can offer, is good location.

After being first sent to the wrong room, then sitting on hold with the front desk for 10 minutes, we finally got the correct room. Then on the second night we found a huge cockroach crawling up the wall. When we took it to the front desk, the manager told us that this is 'normal' and that it's because we are in the city. He tried to tell us that all of the hotels in the area actually have cockroaches. (after seeing a room at the Wyndham down the street, I highly doubt that is true) We didn't even want to stay after finding the cockroach but since it was St. Patty's Day, all of the hotels in the area were sold out. The manager did comp us for one night, even though we wanted him to get us a room in a different hotel.

First if you are on a budget, there is nothing here that should preclude you from staying here, you can't beat the location or the price. The staff was as helpful as they could be - Kelly did everything she could - but unfortunately we had three issues during our stay, all of which could occur anywhere, but it just seems too much for one trip. First the remote control to the TV did not control our TV, after I went down to the desk several times and five remotes later it still didn't work and I couldn't change the channels manually either, so we had a choice of ESPN or nothing - not so great with two kids (they did comp. our rate for that night for this). Second, the toilet overflowed... Kelly was the only one on duty and there was no maintenance people on-site at this 10 PM time so it took over an hour to get a plunger and fresh towels to \"solve\" the issue. Both of these items were resolved the next day while we were out and about, but upon returning the second day after having walked all over the city alas our keys didn't work to let us back in the room... SO, back down the SLOW elevator to get the keys reworked... Again, they fixed it ASAP so they really do try...

Check in was cold and slow. The front desk is right by the door, so your stuck waiting in the cold. Even the desk clerks have to wear winter coats with scarfs. The front desk clerks were more than nice. Parking is not included, but our friend that took us to the city was able to get free parking right in front of the hotel.(appears to be free over the weekend only) Our room was on the 7th floor, room 705. Fabulous view and not such a bad room either. The room came with a fridge and microwave, nice flat screen tv, coffee pot and blow dryer. The room appeared to be newly decorated. The bathroom had not been updated and was pretty small, but we were never in our room, so it didn't matter much. We didn't have maid service, we just got a few extra coffee cups from the maid Maria(who was very sweet) The hotel itself needs updating and general maintenance, but I can't complain. I didn't have any bugs in my room, no bed bugs, bed sheets were clean. What more could I ask for. The location is the best!! Right accross the street was a Dunkin Donuts and 7 Eleven, so very convenient for us to get our beer, water and cheap breakfast. We went to several bars. Two of our favorites were Howl at the Moon-dual piano bar(there is a cover charge) but if you check with the hotel, they may have discount coupons available. We also checked out Blue Chicago(great blues bar) there was a $10.00 cover charge, but it was well worth it, especially when the beers were only $4.00 compared to $7.00 at the Piano bar. Everything we did was in walking distance, although it got real cold Saturday, so we took the $6.00 cab ride back to the hotel. Overall, we had a great time at the Red Roof Inn.

I had a headache whenever I was in the room due to the smell and I asked to get non-smoking but was told no other rooms are available. To top it off though, every night that we stayed here, between 3 and 4am, we were woken up by the most loud obnoxious drunk people I have ever heard. Cops were called twice that I know of on them, because I heard them in the hallway. The walls are extremely thin. Because it consistently happened at the same time, we just decided to assume they are drunk ghosts.

Since we live outside of Chicago, I thought this would be something fun for my husband & I to do. $20 hotel, great location, what's to lose? Normally I research hotels to death before booking, but I could *swear* I'd stayed at this exact hotel years ago, so I didn't research this at all. Big mistake, because I stayed at the hotel across the street, not the Red Roof Inn! This hotel's location is fantastic: 1/2 block off Michigan Ave., 8 blocks from Navy Pier, close to tons of restaurants. It's a perfect location for Chicago shopping/touring. It is safe & very \"walkable.\" Upon check in, the employee looked absolutely startled to see us, perhaps because I am not a hooker? I do not know. In hindsight, I should have known right then that this was a mistake. He was very, very nice. Check in was quick, the rate was correct, we were in our room in minutes. The room was so outdated- like nothing I'd ever seen before. Seriously, my retro 1970's cottage is more 'up to date' than this hotel. The room was small, which I can handle. It was a bed, a dresser with a flat screen tv and a desk. The walls were dingy. I could literally see through the sheets. The sheets were stained. The carpeting was disgusting- like keep your shoes on disgusting, because the Red Roof Chicago apparently doesn't include vacuuming with their cleaning service. There was so much lint/ crumbs/ random debris along where the carpet met the walls, I nearly gagged. We reserved a smoking room, so anticipated a smoky smell, again something I can handle. However, there were ashes all over the desk, floor and bed. My husband had to use the washroom and didn't even wash his hands afterwards because he didn't want to touch the faucet! I would recommend staying anywhere else but here, even if it means buying less while shopping, it's that bad. Remember, this was a $20 room that I wouldn't spend $20 on! I have no idea what the regular rate is, but there is no way I would pay money to stay here. We immediately checked out & were told that we wouldn't be charged. I would have happily paid $20 NOT to stay in this hotel, so I couldn't care less. All in all this ended up being 19 minutes of my life & $6 for 19 minutes of parking that I am ok losing.

We chose it due to the cost. Most of the hotels in and around this location are extremely expensive. In fact pretty much every hotel in Chicago is expensive. With the exception of staying a Youth Hostel, which we didn't want to do. If you want cheaper alternatives with hotels you have to stay outside of Chicago. This wasn't a viable option for us given we were going to rely on walking and using public transit and the occasional cab to get around and sight see. When we first arrived at the Red Roof Inn my instant thought was \"I'm not going to like this\". Unfortunately I was thinking this even more when we went up to our room on the 12th floor. The entire hotel needs some serious updating. From my perspective it looks far better from the outside than it does on the inside. Our room was small and relatively clean. However, it wasn't to the standard of other hotels we had stayed while in the United States. The bathrooms should be updated and there was a smell of mould on the shower curtain. The whole room/bathroom wasn't anything special at all. It certainly didn't look like it did on their website. The first impressions of this place weren't good ones, to the point of me wanting to go across the street to the Marriott, pay whatever they were asking and staying there for the week. However we decided to be brave and stick it out with the Red Roof Inn. We had a few problems. We couldn't get the fridge in the room to work and one of the lights over the bed was flickering on and off. The towel rack in the bathroom came off the wall as well. I reported these things to the front desk and they sent someone straight up. The issues were rectified, but not really to an appropriate standard. Never the less we were able to manage. It's not all negative feed back that I have to offer. What I will say about this hotel is if you can handle the fact that you would be staying in a totally NO FRILLS, BUDGET hotel and if you want somewhere that's central to all the shopping, sightseeing and within walking distance to downtown Chicago, Millenium Park and Navy Pier then this is the hotel for you. The location is one of the main factors that made me enjoy my stay at the Red Roof Inn. I found it extremely easy to walk around and sightsee. I really loved it. If you needed them, cabs were always readily available at the front door to the hotel and there was very easy access to the public transit systems, trains and buses. Which we found great to use. There are also plenty of great places to eat to suit all budgets and places like Walgreens, Traders Joes and 7/11 to purchase food items and other things you might need during your stay. There are some really great Irish pubs / bars within walking distance of this hotel as well. Plus you are within absolute minutes of all the fabulous shopping along the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Avenue, all the designer stores and Macy's, which is absolutely great. It's worth mentioning that the beds in our particular room were very comfortable, which was a blessing, especially when you are staying in a hotel for a week. Plus walking around every day. A comfortable bed to sleep in makes the world of difference. Our room was cleaned each day as well by a really nice staff member, this really helped make our stay a little more comfortable and easier. There was some degree of street noise, like sirens and things like that.. But lets face it MOST cities have that kind of noise. You can't expect to stay in a city and not have noise. I personally didn't find it a problem, others may do so. The main great experience we had staying at this particular hotel was the staff. Two in particular. Tammy at the front desk and one of the staff that cleaned our room. Tammy couldn't do more for us. She was great with offering advice on where to eat, how to use the public transit system and just information in general. She is a complete asset to the hotel. In fact she gave better service to us than some of the 4 and 5 star hotels we had already stayed in while in the United States. The fact our initial feelings about the hotel where \"Oh My God, what are we doing here?\". We ended up making the most of and enjoying our Red Roof Inn Chicago experience. The staff that we interacted with were a credit to the Red Roof Company and basically saved the day for us. Would I stay at this particular Red Roof Inn hotel while in Chicago again. I do have to be honest and say probably not, but that's basically just due to the actual hotel accommodation. However if my budget didn't allow for something that was located more downtown, then I would definitely stay at the Red Roof Inn again, I'd just probably pay the extra fee and stay in one of their Deluxe rooms. Just to have that extra space in the room would be worth it. I don't want to tell people not to stay here, but just to be aware that it's nothing overly special, so you don't get a shock if you do choose to stay at this hotel. My friend and I just made the most of it all. I totally loved Chicago and it far exceed any expectation that I had. It was my favorite part of my United States vacation. In fact I'm already planning to take my next vacation there. I know that this is a lengthy review, however I wanted to be as comprehensive and honest and I could be. I hope that my review helps anyone that is considering staying at the Red Roof Inn.

Almost every review here mentions stains on the floor and my King+ room also had two not so nice stains on the carpet. It's an impression thing.

Close to some fabulous restaurants (Heaven on Seventh 2 blocks away is like falling into New Orleans!). 20-30 minutes by convention shuttle bus to McCormick Place. The Cons: Stains on the carpet were unsightly, but my white socks got no dirtier walking around the room than any other 3-4 start hotel of similar age I've been in. The cleaning staff forgot to replace the shampoo, but a note left on the bed fixed that. No CNBC on the TV is a problem for business travelers.

Although the hotel was average, I have consistently received great customer service from those that I encounter at either Inn that I have visited.

After reading several negative reviews we were very hesitate about staying at this hotel but we were pleasantly surprised. We checked-in at about 4:15pm on a Thursday, it was very quick. We had a king room on the 16th floor. It had a nice flat screen tv & a small desk. The elevators & hallways are very small but...I didn't go to Chicago to spend time in them. The room was more then big enough for my husband & I. I don't know what their double rooms are like but I could see that maybe 2 beds in a room might be a bit tight for a family of 4. However, for as little time spent in the room, I don't think it would be a big deal. If planning to be in the room for long amounts of time, I probably would spend a bit more for a nicer hotel. The elevators & hallways are very small, but again...not there to spend a lot of time in the hotel. The location of this hotel can't be beat, especially for the price. Just steps from Michigan Ave & Magnificent Mile shopping & we were able to easily walk to about everywhere we wanted to go from the hotel. The only real negatives I have about the hotel room are this: the carpet seemed quite dingy with a big pink stain in the corner, the bathroom needed a bit of deep cleaning ie. walls around/below sink & the grout in the shower needed to be scrubbed. This is a no frills place... if you're on a budget & looking for a place to change clothes & sleep at, this is a great value. I really can't complain about anything considering we paid only $50/ night thru Priceline...you can't beat that for the heart of Chicago. Food & drinks in downtown Chicago can be pricey so I recommend the TGI Fridays that is on the other side of the block from the hotel (on Erie St.) They have a very nice bar area & drink specials every day of the week. We didn't find this place until our last day & wished we had much earlier. Great place to sit, watch a game & have a drink after a long day of walking. We also stopped by the Signature Lounge on the 96th floor of the Hancock Bldg. for a drink. Instead of paying $12-$15/person to go to their observation deck, we went to the lounge & had a drink. Drinks are pricey but you get a great drink while enjoying the great view. I recommend going during the afternoon to avoid the crowds for your best chance at a seat by the window. There is also a McDonalds & a Walgreens about 4 blocks west on the same street as the hotel. Also to be checked out: Maggiano's Restaurant (great food, reasonable prices), Navy Pier for fireworks at night (Billy Goat Tavern for a drink), Second City comedy club (great show). We were really impressed as to how easy everything was to get to, either by walking or public transit. We ordered a 3-day pass from the CTA website prior to our trip. They were mailed to our house (included in price) & don't activate until the first time you use them. They are good for unlimited rides on the bus & el train. Use Google Maps for directions, it is connected to the transit authority & will map your way for walking or public transit, giving you the correct bus # or train & how to get to the correct bus stop. We used it on our Blackberry & it worked great! We had one of our best trips ever & the hotel was great for what we needed it for.

I was concerned that If they don't even pick clearly visible toothpicks off the floor, do they wash the sheets? My boyfriend asked that we be moved to a different room, the staff obliged, but that room was just as dissappointing. The other concerning event occurred while I was in the lobby. Several young men came into the hotel lobby and began soliciting people in the lobby - trying to give them fliers and stuff. They were rather harmless, though they did mildly sexually harass me, but they clearly had no business being there and the staff made no attempt at removing them.

If you want high class, go book the W. I made a weekend roadtrip into Chicago and wanted something very cheap and very central to get the most bang for my buck. Red Roof delivered. First, service. When I checked in the service was polite and to the point. They didn't chat me up, try to up-sell me, or bother me with any other trivialities. They checked me in and showed me the way to my room.

It would be a little cramped for a couple, and I certainly wouldn't want to be sharing the room with kids. My room only had 1 bed though, so the others may be larger. For 1 person it was perfect, but I don't go on vacation to spend a lot of time in my room. The room is also equipped with a safe. My only complaints would be that there were a few broken items in the room. The window looked like someone had tried to force it open so I was able to actually remove it from its frame. I only noticed this because it was a little noisy, but being right downtown that's to be expected. The A/C also wasn't working in my room, but I didn't need it at this time of year. It wouldn't surprise me if the two were related. Third, location, location, location. It doesn't get much better than this! 1 block from the Miracle mile, a 10 minute walk to the Navy Pier, and less than 10 minutes to the John Hancock building. It's a phenomenal central location to be able to cover a lot of sites on foot. Lastly, value. I booked on priceline and got my room for $50/night! No complaints there considering the prices of other nearby hotels. Now valet parking was another $40/night but after asking around that sounds like it's pretty typical.

Also, as recommended in previous posts- the \"West egg cafe\" is an excellent breakfast option. There is also a cinema complex near by on Ohio st. (just across a \"Virgin\" mega store). Our only complaint was that this red roof is a t-mobile hotspot, and it didn't function well. We bought a pre-paid weekly pass, and had a lot of problems both with the initial connection to the service and in later on usages.

Sorry, but that just isn't a sufficient reason to stay here when you can use Priceline. If you've never used Priceline, consider Chicago a great chance to start. In April 2006 I booked a room at the Hyatt Regency on Wacker through Priceline for $75 each night and again booked the same rate during our trip in February 2007 at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. In addition to simply being nicer hotels, both rooms were 2 to 4 times larger than our room at the Red Roof. Literally... So, if location is all you care about, Red Roof can be a good find.

The next day we hopped off at the Museum of Science and Industry and saw the wonderful Da Vinci Exhibition. Another day, we boarded the Wendella Chicago River and Lake cruise (1 1/2hrs). It was a beautiful clear blue sky day and the tour was another 'winner'! The Inn is in an area that's scattered with lots of eateries - TGIF, O'Neill's Bar, a cute all-day Corner cafe where lots of locals eat/take-away breakfast/lunch etc and a chinese restaurant across the road from the RR Inn and the usual take-away 'joints'... your choice of food and prices... Check-in/check-out were quick and painless (I had booked on the web and pre-paid) Front Desk staff were friendly and obliging when we asked for advice on where to get a snack. Our 10th floor room was small, but had a really comfortable king size bed (my husband is 6'4\" and I really appreciated that the request for a queen size bed, had been taken into consideration). The bathroom was small - shower/bath combination. The toilet was also in the bathroom. Our airconditioned room overlooked the street and the building opposite. It was quiet enough (just the usual doors slamming in the corridor with inconsiderate patrons) Chicago is a clean, green (Australia is still suffering from drought conditions!) and the architecture is wonderful!", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cA perfect location\u201d", "Author": "frenchtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5288952", "Content": "I recently stayed for 1 night at the Red Roof Inn downtown Chicago, I booked it tjrough Expedia and got a very good deal.

Like many old properties hallways are small, elevators smaller, and rooms are not traditional U.S. size. But they are not jammed either and the owners have invested in contuing upgrades to the public areas and rooms and the decor is very current in all areas with good lighting and comfortable furnishings. Not many people consider fire safety when they select a hotel, and older properties have their own challenges. Nevertheless, my stay at the Red Roof Chicago was the first time in a while that I was conscious of the fact that I was in a building with no central sprinklers, and the two exit stairs consist of one internal staircase around the corner from the main hallway, and a rear fire ESCAPE (i.e. an outside metal-mounted staircase/ladder), not a stairwell. Federal employees generally are required to stay in newer properties with more fire safety systems, and I am in no way suggesting that the property is not safe -- in fact, hallways were always clear, well-lit, alarm system appeard to be upgraded, and there are fire extinguishers/hoses. But it's worth remembering that not all hotels have the same level of life safety technology available.

We paid $130/night, compared to $200-$300/night in hotels that we walked past on a daily basis (i.e. same location). The Best part of the deal was the location. You are literally 1 short block off the heart of Michigan Ave/\"Magnificent Mile\". Free Trolleys run to all the places we wanted to go (museums, shopping, navy pier, parks, etc.) which you can catch within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Lots of wonderful restaurants, we took the Amtrak to Chicago from San Antonio (wanted to \"experience\" the train) and never rented a car. We did mostly the trolleys and a few cab rides. Again, the room was very nice (not the 4 Seasons, but comfortable beds, nice linens, and very clean...plenty of hot water).

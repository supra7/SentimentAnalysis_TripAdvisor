My only complaint is that is it quite expensive for one night (the price of convenience I guess?)

For that purpose, this hotel was ideal as located inside the terminal (no taxi/shuttle and no rental car need). If you are renting a car the following morning, a 10 min walk will get you to the new people mover linking the airport to the rental car building (and soon to Miami). So I'll stay at this hotel again, for it's \"strategic location\". The room was ok (asked for a high floor and got it; asked for a tarmac view and got the parking lot view instead). In the room, due to the beds occupying most of its surface, a column prevents you from getting too close to the window (this is an \"artchitectural nuisance\" but you can't do anything about that!). The front desk staff was nice (answered our questions, which is unusual in Miami, where front desk people usually ask \"what they can do for you\" and then they either don't answer or don't do anything!) and so were the housekeepers. Thank you! The bathroom wasn't spotless clean and previous strange guests had put a matchstick in the hairdryer, that would have caught fire, hadn't we noticed that before using the hairdryer. So attention to detail is essential for housekeeping to prevent fire hazards due to previous \"weird\" customers! The price, well it's more than at any other MIA airport hotels, but you pay for the \"inside the terminal\" location I guess.

We were in no mood to do shuttles, etc. Told the lady at front desk I only needed a room for 5hrs. She offered a slight discount. Took our room key and headed to our room only to discover it didn't work. Returned to front desk, got an apology and reissued two new keys - those didn't work either. Security met us at the door to the assigned room and said he could open any door in the hotel - and he did. The door jam was on, so he couldn't open the door fully, because there was an occupant inside (good reason to always secure your door). He radioed to the desk, and was directed to take us up one floor to another room. Security entered the room to ensure there was nobody inside - it is now well past 1a.m. I immediately phoned the front desk and told the gal that I was extremely upset and that the occupant of the previous room put on his pants to come to the door to inquire what the problem was. She apologized profusely but blamed the computer. I told her I was not interested in hearing any more excuses as to who or what caused the problem. She offered an additional discount. Upon check out the next morning a gentleman was at the reception desk, and inquired whether we had a nice stay. I skimmed over the details but told him they have a safety and security issue that needs to be addressed. He apologized for the inconvenience, and issued the bill at a higher rate than the lady who worked the desk at night. He said he didn't know where she got that rate, but that it didn't exist. I told him I had lousy service, and I don't care who determines the rates, but he said he would honor it nonetheless. I paid and departed immediately. In all fairness, we had a good 4 hours of sleep in a very comfortable bed.

I decided to contact Paola directly - she is the Sales Manager at the hotel and often responds to people's reviews. She was fantastic, and was able to get us a great room both times. Our first stay we had a room on the 7th floor (can't remember the room number). The room was definitely smaller than we are used to staying in, but it was so wonderful to wake up in the morning, and be just a few steps away from the security checkpoint. We saved ourselves at least an hour of sleep, and for that alone, this stay was worth it. Check in and out was quick and easy. The staff were great with my daughter and made us feel welcome and appreciated. Our second stay was Dec 19th, and again Paola got us a great room on the 7th floor - room 747. This room was much more spacious than the first, and worked perfectly for our family. My daughter and I checked in in the afternoon, and got settled in. We found a number of convenient options for dinner just outside of the hotel lobby. My husband arrived in the evening from his international flight, and since it was past my daughter's bedtime, I put her to sleep and waited for my husband's knock at the door. He arrived so quickly after his arrival time, thanks to the fact that he didn't have to wait for a shuttle to the hotel. The next morning we flew out on Alaska airlines which is located right outside of the hotel lobby (again - so perfect!). We were able to sleep in an extra 45 minutes because we didn't have to deal with a hotel shuttle. As for the rooms, the beds were extremely comfortable, the decor was beautiful and it's obvious that they have been recently renovated. I loved the bathroom fixtures - very modern and sleek.

My wife was travelling solo, staying overnight at the Hotel after a Bahamas cruise, and catching a plane home to Maine the next day. She checked in very early, about 10 AM, and was told, understandably, that a room wouldn't be ready until noon, which she understood and accepted. At noon she spoke to a different desk clerk who told that the room now wouldn't be ready until 1PM. My wife glanced over at the other desk clerk who had originally said the room would be ready at noon, saying nothing at all to her, and the newer clerk, observing this, told my wife \"and the room may be available much later if you keep looking at my co-worker like that\". Now, I don't like how my wife looks at me sometimes, either: I'm usually in some kind of trouble if she does that. But I'm a husband, and that's to be expected; but from a hotel desk clerk, well, you don't really expect commentary so breathtakingly rude and arrogant. So my wife, fearing that if she angered the clerk further might find herself without a room, period, went to the lobby where she had a seat, then called and related the story to me at my office 1700 miles away. Now, I was more flabbergasted than angry, but I was also a little angry. I had checked out the reviews for this hotel previously on this site, and had noted how hotel staff checked the comments, and seemed to appreciate all of them, even the negative ones, evidently viewing those as an opportunity to improve service to its customers. So I found a name of a Sales Manager who was commenting frequently in appreciation of the visitors comments, a Mr. Paola Pinillos. So I called the hotel and asked for him. They put me through and he immediately answered. I very calmly explained what had happened; Mr. Pinillos seemed appalled at the clerk's behavior and commentary, and asked me to hold for a moment, which I did. When he returned to the phone maybe 3 or 4 minutes later he advised me that the situation had been rectified. I thanked him for his assistance. A few minutes later my wife called from her room. She said a security guard had come up to her and brought her to the counter where she was checked in by the previously rude clerk, who was now very friendly, courteous and helpful, and taken to her room which the hotel had upgraded for free. Now, I had made no demands or threats of or to Mr. Pinillos; I recognize that the clerk, like anyone, can have a bad moment, but I did believe that Mr. Pinillos would care about a situation like this, which he obviously did.

However, I'm sure by now most people know how convenient it is to stay at Miami International Airport Hotel when you have an overnight with an early flight the next day, when you got to MIA late, tired and don't feel like driving around in a cab to look for a hotel room, or when you just want to rest before going on other business the next day...Whatever your reasons are, this hotel can provide you with the peace of mind of not having to go through the hassle of getting out of the airport and having to deal with public transportation, especially after a long flight. Located right inside the airport, one floor up of the International arrival, you couldn't find a better location for an airport hotel. I came in from Europe through Chicago, and found out on the way that I had to go all the way to Orlando to take care of some business. I decided to drive from Miami to Orlando, but could not do it the same day of my arrival, I needed to rest. And I had 3 luggages; I didn't have the strength to move around with them. So from Chicago, I booked a room at hotel as I knew it would only take me 5 min to get to the front desk from the moment I collect my luggage. It was around 8pm, I was tired, I collected my luggage, got to the front desk, the check-in was very expedite with a friendly staff who welcomed me with a warm smile. A concierge asked me he can bring my luggage up for me, I got to my room, and 5 min later my luggages were there. I thanked him with a tip and I just threw myself into the bed! I booked a standard queen room. It wasn't large, but I wasn't looking for space. The bed was comfortable enough for my sleep, and I had space in the open closet for my stuff. The bathroom was a regular one, nothing really fancy or modern, just organized, clean with all the amenities, particularly the towels that are nicely arranged for guests. I had everything I needed for my night and went straight to bed. Despite the very proximity of the hotel with runways, the rooms are very quiet and you are not disturbed by any kind of noise from planes landing or taking off. Additionally, as a bonus to hotel guests, they also have those coupons in each room that give you discounts on most shops in the terminal...very useful when planning to do some shopping or just to have a drink in the terminal. As I needed to rent a car to hit the road, this hotel happens to be very convenient, as all I needed to do and go down, get out the hotel, and the rental shuttle bus was right there. Once I got the car, I came back to the hotel to collect my luggage. And because I got there after 12pm, time of check-out, I knew the room key wouldn't work anymore, so I asked at the front desk and they assisted me immediately. They also kept one of my luggages when I was putting others in the car. Overall great experience as usual and I will not hesitate to go back this hotel every time I need to. The room could be a bit pricy sometimes, but when you get a good deal, it's worth it!

It was so small that we had a hard time figuring out where to put our luggage on the floor (there was no closet or any sort of stand to place luggage on) where we'd still be able to walk around the bed and get to the bathroom. We called down to the desk to ask for a folding luggage rack (figuring we could put one suitcase on top of the rack and slide a smaller one underneath it), but the front desk not only told us the hotel had no luggage racks, they actually seemed puzzled about what a luggage rack even was (a quite bit of the staff doesn't seem to have English as their first language, which is probably a great help for many international travelers staying at this hotel, but it caused some minor, occasional confusion with us). On the other hand, the friend we were traveling with had a pricier \"Standard Room,\" and it was, in fact, a perfectly standard-sized, well-appointed hotel room with plenty of space. (When they later saw our \"Queen\" room, they literally burst out in laughter at its tiny size.) The fairly bad: Checking into the airport proved to be a lot of hassle, since we wanted to unload our rental car at the hotel and check in, then return the rental car. But because of airport security regulations, there's absolutely nowhere to leave a car unattended for even a couple of minutes at the hotel entrance.

The floor in the bathroom also had hair on it (not ours) - as if had not been cleaned after the last travelers. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location.

My original intent was to go to the most convenient hotel for arriving and departing passengers as my family was looking forward to a quick nights' sleep as we needed to get up early to catch our early morning flight back home. We were not disappointed. As we exited the secure zone from the arrival gates, I asked directions to the hotel and the reality was that all we had to do was go up to the 2nd level, that's where check-ins take place and the hotel was within 100 ft of the American Airlines gate exit. The hotel check-in was quick and I did ask for a renovated room as I knew this hotel was undergoing renovations. By the way, the hotel website directly states that the hotel facilities and major activity areas are under construction. The pool was unavailable as well as the tennis courts and other areas as indicated on their website. So any traveler doing their own research should have discovered this before arriving and if not, they did not do due diligence. After checkout out the United gates were quite far away. I believe the hotel is centrally located so any airline with gates near the ends of the airport will entail long walks. The room was adequately roomy. We had two queen beds, which were perfect for my wife,my son and I. The beds were quite comfortable as they use pillow top mattresses, at least in their renovated rooms. The decor was nice and modern and in great shape. The water worked fine. They use a single wide rain type shower head in the tub. The rooms were quite sound proof an we did not hear any airplane sounds at all. There was plenty of lights, often for me a minor irritant, but it was not a problem here. The hotel has ice machines on every guest floor and a vending machine as well. The hotel also provides a copy of the local Miami Herald in the morning.

The rooms have been refurbished and the room service is great after a long trip. Nothing beats staying inside the hotel and not having to drag your bags in and out of cars. I will continue to stay at this hotel, the staff is great and took our luggage all the way to our airline. Loved it! I recommend the breakfast on the top floor.

At 2330 at night, this is not good news. Obviously, the front desk staff ( with minimal apology ), thought that I was not coming, and gave my room to another guest.

The hotel itself was very nice, actually nicer then expected. The only problem - and it was enough for me to only give this hotel 2 stars - was the front desk staff. Three families checked in, we were all charged a higher rate then indicated on our confirmation. We were then told not to worry - it would be changed when we check out. The next morning when we checked out (thank goodness we didn't use the express automatic check out) we were incorrectly charged - everyone's credit card was place with different rooms - it was a real mess. I wouldn't be upset about this normally, but the attitude of the \"management\" behind the desk was horrible... she didn't want to explain the problem , just keep sighing at us, telling us they made the corrections, she didn't want to give us any back up that the charges were removed. She was a real \"B\" if you ask me! I was never spoken to in such a matter, and when I tried to explain to her that once we left we had no proof that this was actually done, she told me \"I explained this to you to many times\"...SHe would not give me last name...she was just totally out of line.

The rooms were standard in spaciousness but the beds were dreamy for a late arrival. The bathroom was pretty good, all enclosed instead of having the sink separate from the toilet and shower. One weird thing was that the bathroom door was on a hinge that made it shut automatically. Wasn't sure what this was about. Also our room didn't have a closet but I noticed that other rooms did.

First, the location was perfect for our flight departing at 11:30am. Check in was quick and easy, and we received one of the newly renovated rooms which was tastefully decorated, had a great, cushy king size bed, and the room was very clean. Even looking out the window at the runway, we could not hear the planes land or depart. The location allowed us to check in to our flights early, securing us exit row seating. Then we had a leisurely breakfast at the hotel restaurant, where we had great service. The only negative I could come up with would be that the cabinet holding the tv is extremely wide, making the passage between the cabinet and bed narrow. A flat screen might solve that problem!

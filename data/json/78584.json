If you want something posh, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a good value and a comfortable room, the Vines is a solid choice. Facilities: The hotel's facilities are fairly limited. There is a small outdoor pool and a nice hot tub. Towels are available poolside. There are no workout facilities. The breakfast provided is limited... coffee, granola bars, and fruit is available by the check-in desk for you to grab and go. There is also a discount for guests at the Denny's next to the hotel. Rooms: The rooms look to have been renovated in recent years, though there are places where the age of the hotel shows through (e.g. the hallways definitely show their age). Still, the rooms are fairly large, comfortable and clean. Wireless Internet is free in the room. The TV was an old, CRT set, but it worked well. There was an in-room coffee maker. The room was quiet during my stay. The digital climate control system is new. It worked well, though for cost-saving purposes it shuts off when you are out of the room (motion sensor). You have to give the room some time to return to a comfortable temperature when you come back. Service: The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Location: The hotel is just outside downtown Napa (couple of minutes drive), basically at the beginning of the Silverado Trail. It is an excellent location for exploring both Napa and Sonoma. There is also a shopping center on the other side of the highway (Solscal Ave.) Value: I paid $150 (including taxes) per night. Parking and Internet were free.

The problems started as soon as we walked in the door, the staff hadn't turned the heat on prior to our arrival and the room was freezing.

The bedding on the sofa bed consisted of a sheet and one thin cotton \"blanket\". The hotel offered pay per view movies, but you can't access them using the remote control and there were no directions for what to do. After calling the front desk twice and getting no answer, I walked down to the lobby and told the young man(who appeared to be completely by himself) about our problems. He promised to bring us more blankets and gave me a phone number to call for the pay per view. I called but the automated directions made no sense and I gave up after waiting on hold for five minutes. When the front desk kid showed up with the blankets we had him call the pay per view number. After waiting on hold for about ten minutes he got hold of somebody but it turns out the movies are only shown at certain times and the one we wanted was already half way through so we gave up. We asked him if there was any way to get more heat out of the heater and he said somebody would take a look at it first thing in the morning.

HORRIBLE building. The mini-fridge was also in need of repair. It would suddenly make this loud, high-pitched noise that sounded like a kitten was dying. It was so annoying we had to unplug it. Finally, although it is advertised that each room comes with free internet access, (either wireless or through an ethernet port, depending on the room), ours came with neither. We even asked the concierge to check it out, and after 15 minutes he conceded that our room simply did not have access.

The Hotel is in a great location, very close to Union Square, China Town and all the main attractions of San Francisco. This little boutique Hotel is really a diamond in the heart of San Francisco. Rooms are quite big and decorated in a lovely way (flowered wallpaper in each floor/room). The bed is extremely comfortable and the bedroom offers all the things you might need, from the closet, to the big tv including an electric fireplace (very useful considering how cold and rainy San Francisco was). The room's price includes an American Breakfast and complementary soft drinks. The staff is kind and very helpful, always available. Since it is a boutique hotel in the heart of San Francisco, the building is quite old and it may cause some little problem (ex the sink gets always flooded) but these are very small issues compared to the great advantages this Hotel offers.

However, as I was on a business trip this time around, I opted to stay in a hotel in the city. I was impressed with the reviews mentioned in tripadvisor and went ahead to book. The hotel didnt fail. It was a great location in the city along Bush St where it is a little quieter instead of being on Powell St itself. The hotel is a beauty... not your typical decor. The fireplace in the room was definitely a draw for me. The dining room in the basement served simple and lovely breakfast (nothing huge like the typical American breakfast) but sufficient to fuel yourself in the morning. I didnt get to enjoy the evening wine and snacks served but my co-worker did and she said it was lovely, especially the ambience. The only hiccups I had were with the wifi - signal was not very strong and whenever I was on \"facetime\" (apple mobile app), the line would drop off which proved to be disruptive in the conversation. The other was the television - somehow I had only 1 channel and I had to ask the front desk twice to have someone come fix it. Wasnt a big deal since that 1 single channel had great movies for the day. I will return back to White Swan if given the opportunity or maybe I would try the Petite Auberge (also a Joie de Vivre group).", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cfriendly and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "kamkids", "ReviewID": "UR126519544", "Content": "We were here for three nights in Feb. 2012 and enjoyed our stay.

It is really an adorable place, with cute all sorts of collections of antiques for decor - teddy bears, china, even matchstick models. The old fashioned elevator was a real treat! The service we received from the staff was great. The maid service was especially good - when we put the do not disturb sign up, the maid left a bag of fresh towels on our door handle for us. Very nice! The breakfast has a fairly good selection and the hot food would vary from day to day. Breakfast is served in this downstairs lounge - they had it all decorated for Christmas! It has a fireplace sitting area, some couches, lots of room and is a great place to sit and chat. They also serve wine and snacks from 4-7pm, which was a nice touch and helped my husband and I relax after a day out walking. The room itself was was really cute and having a fire place was great and romantic! And everything was clean and well taken care of. Being a Joie de Vivre property, you can sign up for their loyalty card for free - which my husband and I did - which meant we got a little bottle of wine, some chocolates and free teddy bear upon arrival. This is without having stayed at one of their properties before, so you don't have to have any points to start getting the benefits! They have a valet parking service, which we used once when we rented a car - it was quick and I think the price was on par with what you'd have to pay elsewhere in the city. The only small issue I had with the hotel was that whatever cleaner they used left a smell behind, which made the place smell kinda like a hospital. We got used to it after a bit but both of us having mothers who are very sensitive to smells, I just wanted to point that out because if you are sensitive to that kind of thing, it could be a problem. But really, that's a very minor thing and everything else was fantastic. The location is close to Union Square, however, it is up a fairly steep hill - which you may be able to manage quite well normally, but with 30-40 pounds of luggage, we found it quite a challenge.

What a lovely old hotel! It's in a perfect situation too-only five minutes from Union Square. Our room was as chintzy as anything I have ever seen with lovely rosy wallpaper, rosy prints, lots of space, a sofa and a decent bathroom. The complimentary drinks in the fridge were a thoughtful, and unusual, addition. The lift was a real old Alfred Hitchcock movie one with a clangy gate and plush red inside. The wine and cheese at 5.pm was delightful and a really lovely meeting place for the guests. Breakfast was great too and the cookies in the lobby-oh my gosh! Lemon poppyseed when we were there. There were lovely teddy bears in the lobby too but I was a tad disappointed not to have one in our room! Our bed was only a double which was mildly disappointing and our neighbours were noisy, waking us up several times during the night. Not the fault of the hotel though. I had a bad fall in the dining room at breakfast time while carrying two cups of tea. There is a small flight of stairs beside the tea urn and I missed my footing and fell right down, in a mess of spilled tea and broken china.

The bathroom is in great need of renovation...floor tiles dirty looking and broken, the bathtub was dirty with scum and even after scrubbing didn't look much better, and all of the taps were leaking. The net curtains in the dirty windows were frighteningly dirty. The weather was hot and we wanted to open the windows and put the fan on but because of all the dust we waited to express our concerns to the person at the desk. Their solution was to put us in another room which was actually dirtier. We suggested that they remove the curtains, which they did, except for one panel which was left. They cleaned them(?) and replaced them the next day. When we complained about the dirty bathtub they sent housekeeping to clean it. The hotel is old and charming but it is in dire need of major cleaning. I would also suggest that they switch to shower gel instead of soap to cut down on the scum in the bathroom and provide proper cleaning products to housekeeping.

Three of us had the Ashleigh suite located directly adjacent to the lobby check in. The other four had two separate rooms. The hotel was wonderful! It is close to everything..cable cars, Union Square, restaurants and shopping. I always felt safe during my stay. The breakfasts were a great surprise..quiche, oatmeal, breads..fruits, jams, preserves, cereal...a different assortment daily. A favorite was the apple crisp. It was wonderful! At five o'clock wine and snacks were served. There were cookies available constantly. Tea and coffee were also plentiful. The rooms were clean, the staff professional. Each room had a fireplace in it along with very home-like decorative touches. Sodas and water are supplied gratis in the room refrigerator. The staff were all professional, friendly and informative. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the San Francisco bay area. My only criticism of the hotel is that they need to freshen up the entrance lobby and the fire escapes on Bush Street. The lobby needs a facelift. Of course, it is a busy place so it sees more wear and tear, however, when entering a building it is the first impression that a traveler has. I will be honest, when I first entered, I was a little concerned as the settee and oriental rug appeared worn. I also had noticed that the paint was peeling off of the fire escape. There was some paint missing on banisters as well. These are small cosmetic fixes which I am sure the owner will tend to. I must admit, the rest of the hotel was lovely, clean and comfortable...and as I stated the breakfast, snacks and wine were all outstanding!!

This is not a chain hotel with on-demand movies and every convenience, but it is nice and we didn't hear kids running up and down halls. All in all, White Swan gives super value for the money.

Most of the reviews were awesome and it sounded like a great place to unwind after running around all day. I must say that my stay was what expected and more. The accommodations were like staying someone else's home, not perfect but just quirky. The room was comfortable and clean, a working fireplace that we even got the chance to use in July. Although the bathroom took a little getting use to (large old tub). The decorations was sweet and just so welcoming to sit and talk to other people. The couple of times I got to evening tea were memorable, meet some great people. The breakfast was awesome usually my best meal of the day. (Cooked meals everyday) One morning I went down early to make myself some time tea and the staff hadn't had a chance to prepare anything. The lady on duty was so nice to drop what she was doing just to boil me so water. This hotel is within walking distance of shopping, dining, Chinatown and the streetcars so we got around pretty easy. Like I said I was I could say it was perfect. I called a couple weeks before arriving to request a early check-in. The operator said that she couldn't promise anything and that was fair but I had also requested a room away for the busy street (good point to remember since you are downtown). When I arrive the front desk said that my room wasn't ready. No problem. But, the room they place us in was not only on the street but all the way on the top floor. So with the hotel's antiquated elevator (we never used to whole time we were there) this was not going to be acceptable. So after waiting a little (went to have lunch somewhere) we were place in a room on the back on the second floor where we were comfortable. I specifically told the front desk at that time that my mother would be checking in the following day so she wouldn't have a hard time. But, that is exactly what happened, she was given a hard time and was told that she could not check in. The last thing that really just left me with not so a great impression. Again the employee who check me in that first day, charged my card for $1000 for incidentals. When I asked about this, the young man that was on duty that day even thought that this was a ridiculous amount and doesn't know what that man was smoking that day. It took me a couple of visits to the front desk to straighten it out. Everyone else was so nice and professional, I don't know what was this guy's problem.

This is largely down to the staff, every one of whom I came into contact with, even just passing in the corridor, was welcoming, friendly, helpful and chatty. It made me feel completely at home. It was lovely to be able to look forward to coming back to the hotel rather than just treating it as somewhere to sleep. Breakfast was excellent (and, even better, included in the price). I was slightly apprehensive about going down to the evening wine & nibbles, as I was travelling alone, but there was no need to be. There is plenty space to sit on your own (and nod off, due to jet lag, in my case), or join with others if you feel like it - the sitting room area has lots of nooks and crannies, so it's all very relaxed, and the \"nibbles\" are far more substantial than I had expected. In fact I found I didn't need to go out for dinner afterwards, as I had had a reasonable-sized lunch and, having just arrived in the States, my bodyclock was out of synch anyway. Breakfast and the wine reception both had different offerings on different days. My bedroom was huge, with a good sitting area, and was very clean. The decor seemed a tiny bit tired in the daylight, but the room was lovely and cosy in the evenings with the living-flame gas fire on. There is a coffee maker in the bedroom, plus complimentary soft drinks (Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, bottled water) in the in-room fridge. Complimentary coffee and a wide range of teas is available in the sitting room day and night (with both china cups/mugs and to-go paper cups with lids, which was super-handy), and there is a jar of complimentary cookies in the entrance hall. There is a turndown service (I imagine that's why another reviewer's teddy bear wasn't on the bed when he got back...), so fresh towels are available in the evening if you need them. Bathroom toiletries are good quality. The hotel is in an old building, so its chintz theme didn't seem out of place (the old-fashioned lift reminded me of \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", but I didn't need to tap dance to get it to work.) If you prefer anonymous hotels or sleek modern ones, then the White Swan is probably not for you. Otherwise I would heartily recommend it.

Another plus, a good supply of bottled water and soft drinks provided free of charge in the room minibar and replenished every day. All these little extra don't go unnoticed. These is a large clean laundromat half a block away, also a good hairdresser, and the hotel is within walking distance to Union Square, just take your time walking back to the hotel as its pretty steep.

The staff were friendly and anything we required was provide in friendly, timely fashion. Breakfast was interesting - I've never eaten quiche for breakfast before - but enjoyable. For me, the location had positives and negatives, it's a couple of blocks up from the Tenderloin district which is dodgy, this means that some streets around the hotel have lots of homeless - this isn't uncommon in San Francisco, the place is full of homeless - most of whom appear to be borderline mental... or at least have a screw slightly loose. On the other hand, the hotel is close to anything you care to mention, although again - not uncommon in San Francisco as it's a small place. The Tenderloin does have it's upsides with some great bars, we really enjoyed visiting bourbon and branch which is a couple of blocks away (reservation required). An excellent restaurant near by was the R & G lounge and the edge of China Town - really good food.

I agree with most previous reviewers about its great staff, convenient location, good-sized rooms (for San Francisco), good breakfasts, fresh-baked cookies every day (a different varieties, and definitely not from a tub of cookie dough), free soft drinks, fireplace in our room, and our wi-fi did work throughout our stay! What won us over was the \"total package\" of the White Swan with its unique charm, slight quirkiness, as well as its imperfections! We didn't want the overly personal attention of a small B & B, but also not the blandness of a large modern hotel. We felt we could retain some privacy, yet also felt welcome to socialize with other guests - both were perfectly okay here. We could tell that the staff genuinely liked working there by their friendly pride, the way they interacted with guests and more importantly - they way they treated each other.

Afternoon tea is served in the adjoining den areas which have comfy couches, wing backed chairs and fireplaces. There is wine, cordials, coffee, tea, cookies or cake, fruit and cheese, something hot like artichoke dip or lasagna or salad. In addition to the china cups and saucers by the coffee and hot water pot, there are also paper cups with covers for those \"on the go\". Since we keep kosher, we only had the juice, fruit and cold cereal, but everyone said the food was good. For shabbat, we were able to go to shul at the oldest orthodox shul in the city, Congregation Kenneset Israel on Sutter Streeet, which is only about 3-4 blocks away. You can make arrangements to have dinner and lunch there for shabbat. A few blocks away at the entrance to Chinatown near the arch there is a kosher restaurant, Sabra, which serves good middle eastern food. The Inn also has a small exercise room which has a treadmill and bicycle with a TV to watch while exercising. A computer is also in this room ($5.00 for 20 minutes) .

We were in California to celebrate my mom's 70th birthday. We spent 4 nights/5 days at the White Swan Inn at the beginning of our trip. The White Swan Inn was a great choice. It was a great small hotel in a big city in a good location. We had a room on the 1st floor with not much of a view other than a giant tree & a building behind us. But, it worked out fine for my mom who does not navigate stairs very well. There is an antiquated elevator that works perfectly fine for those that may be interested or need it. The hotel is older of course but very clean and tidy. Our room was spacious enough to accomodate the three of us with a king bed and a pull out sofa. At the beginning of our stay it was a bit chilly. The middle through the end of our stay the San Francisco weather was beautiful & warm. On warmer days, it did get a bit stuffy in the room in the evening and overnight. We did open the windows (our room had no screens) and this did help with the ventilation. On chilly mornings/evenings, the gas fireplace and heater in the room worked very well. The room, the bathroom, and the rest of the hotel are all very clean. As I mentioned before, a bit older but clean. The breakfast in the morning was good and of course very convenient. This made timing in the morning much easier so we didn't have to find breakfast every morning. Breakfast we certainly adequate with normally 2 hot items (quiche and scrambled eggs), hard boiled eggs, some type of protein (normally sausage), fresh fruit, bread, croissants, warm oatmeal, cold cereals, 2 juices, coffee, tea, etc. It was plenty to start off your busy day of touring San Francisco and the surrounding areas. Evening wine & cheese was also very nice with one type of red and white wine being offered along with a few hors o'dourves (normally some type of veggie & dip, brushetta on crackers, cheese & crackers, small meatballs, etc.). There were typically 3 items served each evening (at least on the evenings we made it). On my mom's 70th birthday we were in Napa all day. When we returned around 7pm there was a birthday cake in the room waiting for her - courtesy of the White Swan. I thought that was very nice. Our travel agent mentioned the birthday when making the reservation. The front desk staff at the White Swan Inn were always friendly and helpful. Kevin was exceptionally nice and very helpful. Another gentleman, Andy I believe his name may have been, who brought us to our room and also seemed to prep the area for the wine reception was also very nice.

It was spacious, had windows overlooking a side greenery area, was beautifully decorated in red/green plaid bedding with floral wallpaper.

Generally a charming place with teddy bears on beds and sleeper sofa. Our room was more spacious than 4-star hotel where we stayed prior 3 nights in San Francisco. Beds were comfortable, nice little wet bar area, lots of hot water, & decent hot breakfast. Accommodating staff. Very clean. The fireplace was a very nice touch. Small grocery across street & a small sandwich shop that probably closed around 9 p.m. Downstair sitting & dining areas are very pleasant & lots of old world charm. Cons. The fifth floor room appeared to need some TLC. The faucet in the wet bar leaked & could not get it to turn off. My husband had to shut off the water, water dripped from cold water faucet in bathroom, repeatedly asked for extra towels that never arrived for we had 3 persons in room, & 19 inch color tv (cable hookup with lots of channels) with sound that was very low & barely could be heard with street noises. There probably are governors on the sound so occupants cannot turn on tv too loudly. This is not a problem unless you want to really listen to tv intensely, but who would --this is San Francisco!!! The elevator left much to be desired. It had its own charm, but if a person left the gate open, then the elevator would not operate. This was tough trying to haul baggage to main floor when leaving hotel. There is no way to let front desk know about this problem unless you go back to your room or someone ventures down the stairs. We lost 10 minutes just trying to get from fifth floor to main floor when leaving for our flight. Breakfast does not start until 7 a.m., which is ok while not on business or needing to get an early flight out. Our son was in dining room at 7 a.m. when departing, but no food was even ready -- we had no breakfast before leaving for our flight. You have to go to first floor to get ice, but this is not a deal breaker. My husband did not really feel comfortable venturing out after 9 p.m. on street so got food from small grocery across street.

We were paying club rate and being treated like children! In one a printed sheet informs one how to dress for their breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (basically a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meal), told not to take food out of the room and you are watched on cameras.

The rate was good, and the pictures looked cute, so I decided to experiment. Usually online photos are better then the truth. You cannot smell mustiness online. I arrived expecting the worst to be honest. The outside is nothing spectacular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as I found in Europe. Exteriors can be deceiving. The sweetest desk person \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mouth full of braces revealing the most gorgeous smile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was more then accommodating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You need more body lotion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll send it up.

Had a hard time finding the switch to turn on the fireplace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but again, there was no blown out gasp of condescension when I called down to inquire where in the room it might be hiding. The snack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c uh wine and cheese, grapes, etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was sweet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good way to mingle. But the breakfast was beyond what I expected. The quiche is homemade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I really was ready for it to be a Costco kind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve scene \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something made with lard and gelatin. It was light and full of veggies. There was fruit, juice, and a huge yummy pot of oatmeal. Great homemade scones and yummies. When I asked one of the serving ladies were these warmed muffins made there, she had the very slightly affronted response that comes from someone carrying the pride of their work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was thrilled.

Quality Control and Attention to Detail Needed.\u201d", "Author": "Vermonter_7", "ReviewID": "UR8466579", "Content": "The White Swan Inn is a very nice property located in a very convenient location--BUT(!!)--they need to do some self-inspection and quality control before they lose all of the stars and diamonds which, I assume, they've worked to earn over a long period of time. My wife and I stayed at the White Swan during a recent conference I was required to attend. We stayed 2 nights. The front desk staff welcomed us nicely although beware--there really are no bellmen to speak of. The only person on duty is the person sitting at the front desk and as such, you will be required to carry your luggage up the front stairs and into the lobby. Very nice guys at the front desk and they probably would have assisted with the luggage if asked...but should one have to ask at a place with a lot of diamonds and stars? Because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor and in publications that award diamonds and stars, we decided to stay in the property's only suite accomodation: The Ashleigh Suite. It was nice but, again, beware--there are certain things you should know. The living room part of the suite faces the front of the hotel, directly on Bush Street...and at ground level. It's a tad bit noisy but not too bad--if you don't mind some street noise. The hotel is not air-conditioned which would not necessarily be a bad thing given that San Francisco is usually pretty cool, temperature-wise and you can open the windows. HOWEVER--in the living room portion of the Ashleigh Suite, the windows do not open. They have been closed in with plexi-glass presumably to thwart people from breaking in. In theory, that's a great idea--but in practice, there is no way to cool down the room with outside air because the windows don't open. In the bedroom portion of the Ashleigh Suite, the windows do open but, beware--there are things one should know. The bedroom portion faces what is, in essence, a small courtyard. It's a narrow courtyard and each room (from the ground level where the Ashleigh Suite is) to the top floor faces one another. That's not really unexpected because it's a small, older building. BUT--the narrow courtyard has become a disgusting pigeon sanctuary filled with pigeon poop; fighting birds, white feathers on the window sills and constant cooing. Why can't they get someone out there once a month or so and just wash it down with a garden hose? Why can't they do something to keep the birds out of there? If you don't need to open the windows, then this is a non-issue. But if you want fresh air in the room (remember, there is no A/C), expect everything connected with pigeons. Oh--and by the way--the cooks who come in at 5:30 to get the complimentary breakfast prepared can be heard from the Ashleigh Suite...if you decide to leave the windows open. It is almost as if they were in your room. I can only guess that the kitchen must be right under the Suite. I'm sure they would have lowered their voices if we had called the front desk, but should one have to call the front desk for something like this at a place with a lot of diamonds and stars? The decor in the Ashleigh Suite is nice but beware--it's getting tired and worn and sooner, rather than later, the owners are going to perform an overhaul. Two of the lamps were broken and fell apart when turned on. The bedspread was, when it was newer, nice--but now it's getting old. The bathrooms (there are two in the Ashleigh Suite because it's basically two connecting rooms) are very clean but still, feeling their age. How about some new tile on the floors? Don't get me wrong. The place is nice. The location is outstanding. The valet parking works fine. (It costs $34 per night and you have to wait 30 minutes between calling for the car and getting it--but that's manageable). The breakfasts are plentiful with fresh fruit, pastries, quiche, sausage and toast. Pretty much the same things everyday--but still, above average...and included in the rate. The room refrigerators are stocked with complimentary waters and soft drinks. How many places do you know that do that? The afternoon wine and cheese is a very nice touch although, on one night, they served a green salad, of all things. There were other things like green olives but the salad was odd...and not very practical. Still, though, it's complimentary. There is a small patio off of the main dining area--BUT--it was locked and not very inviting.

The White Swan is very close to a lot of places of interest in SF. It's a hop from Chinatown and very close to Union Square. It really is conveniently located for so many things. While I am a seasoned visitor to San Francisco, I did hear the staff giving great advice to visitors and recommending some wonderful places to visit. I asked the concierge about the history of the hotel and he was extremely knowledgeable. I would recommend the White Swan Inn to anyone. It's cozy, comfortable and we had a relaxing evening in our room.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLOVED this place!\u201d", "Author": "dianmarie514", "ReviewID": "UR8350913", "Content": "We stayed here in late July of 2007 and were most favorably impressed with our entire experience. The White Swan Inn was chosen based on other reviews posted on Trip Advisor. The gracious folks at the front desk were very helpful whenever we had a question. And our room! It was beautiful -- spacious and tastefully decorated. We loved the gas fireplace and turned it on each evening. Be advised that even in the middle of summer, San Francisco has chilly nights! The breakfast buffet was varied and we found it filling. Fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, an egg flan, bacon, sausage or ham, juice, coffee and tea were available each morning. The afternoon wine reception was another perk. On Friday evening, there was live music -- a delightful guitar and flute duo. We also like the fresh cookies and around the clock availability of coffee and tea. The location is up the hill from Union Square. We had no trouble walking to the Square, Moscone (Convention) Center or to the Curran Theatre to see Jersey Boys. The walk UP the hill was a bit challenging and I wouldn't recommend trying to negotiate it with luggage in tow. However, going DOWN the hill with luggage was no problem and we walked for several blocks on a Sunday morning to get to the Powell St. BART station for a $6.35 trip to Oakland Airport. On the way in, we took BART to Powell St. and then hopped in a taxi to the White Swan Inn. (An additional $10 that included a tip for the driver.) This hotel is part of the Joie de Vivre chain of California hotels. Before booking the White Swan Inn, I'd suggest joining the free Joie de Vivre Club, which gets you points towards free amenities as well as a choice of gifts upon arrival in any of their hotels. Just do a web search for Joie de Vivre hotels and you can quickly join the Club online.

It reminded us of a higher end, older European hotel.The bathrooms are not huge, but clean and the extra sink in the dressing area makes up for the smallish bathroom. There is no air conditioning, but then it's not really needed.

The streets are confusing and the hill on the way back to the hotel from the main city area is super steep and did cause some thigh and calf burning! Anyways, we took a cab about $40 from the airport and we got checked in promptly. Our room was pretty big, bigger than I expected! Best part was the free mini-fridge in our room with 2 cokes, sprites, diet cokes, and bottles of water-replaced daily. The bed was a queen, the bathroom was nice, white fluffy accents and the Aveda products were a really nice touch. The hotel is decorated old English style with teddy bears everywhere. Not my style but it was fine. The free cookies were a nice touch. We went to the free wine and appetizer hour a couple of times, nice! Breakfast was good. Quiche, cereal, breads, and fruits were offered daily. Plus juice coffee and tea were offered. Better than a Holiday Inn continental breakfast, that is for sure! The hotel is like 7-8 blocks from the major shopping areas and convention center. Walking down the hill is no big deal in fact I recommend it. I went to the beach one day. I took the BART with a friend who lives there. I recommend that! The Fisherman's W. is totally touristy and new with chain and non-chain restaurants. We got crab at a cute fish market... oh and we went to Alcatraz as well. Nice tour. Buy your tickets online & in advance.

We wanted to stay in a cute, unique boutique kind of hotel and not a big hotel chain and that is exactly what we got. I'll try to break down this review to make it helpful. 1. Room & Decor: We stayed in a Luxury King Room on the top floor after finding a great deal on it. If you like that old world, european kind of charm then these rooms are definitely for you. We liked the antique style furniture, wood floors by the entry, the little nook with the fridge, the separate vanity area and walk-in closet, fireplace, down comforter, soft linens, etc. It was plenty big. Like I mentioned, the decor is for those that like that old european feel, not for those looking to stay in a room from a hotel chain; it's not like a hilton, marriott, etc. It's definitely not modern. --Being a smaller boutique hotel, it does not tower over it's neighboring buildings; therefore, it does not offer much of a view. On the top floor we were able to see the tops of several tall buldings but that is it. 2. Cleanliness: We were generally pleased with this. Yes, it is an older place so the bathrooms are not sparkling new; it has an older tub, toilet, etc. Even the carpets and such are older but they were vaccumed regularly. But it was definitely clean and hygenic. My wife and I didn't mind this at all because we were expecting it to be older, but we never had any problems with the cleanliness of it. I didn't give the place a white glove test but nothing stood out in our time there. 3. Service: We had great service our entire trip. Turn down service was offered every night, linens and towels were changed promptly when requested, etc. Even when we refused turn-down service they still offered us chocolates. --On our first night the bellboy (I think that's what he was) noticed we did not have a VCR in the room and immediately went and got one. --The front desk probably got tired of all the questions about restaurants and directions that we asked but they were very polite and answered each one. We were given some great suggestions on places to eat (Cafe Claude, Mama's, Kate's Kitchen, etc.) and contrary to some other experiences on here, they called a cab for us right away when we needed it on our last day. I guess it depends on who is there. --When I booked the room I asked the front desk if they do anything for honeymooners and was told they would try and do something. I wasn't expecting anything but they were so gracious and had champagne, chocolates, and a teddy bear waiting there. 4. No A/C: When booking the hotel room I called a bunch of boutique and non-boutique hotels and asked a few questions. I was surprised to find out that most of the boutique styled hotels don't have A/C. I was a bit nervous about this but it was not a problem at all (we were there at the beginning of July). With the windows open we were actually cold at night. Maybe it was because we were on the top floor but the breeze was nice and steady and at times, actually too cold. I googled the climate in SF and I found that Aug and Sept are hotter than Jun/Jul, so I guess we went at a good time, especially with the heat wave that just passed through. 5. Location: Up towards nob hill, it is about a 10 min walk to Union Square (shopping, public transportation to almost anywhere in SF), a 5 min walk to Powell St (to catch the cable car, if you'll be taking this or other public transport a lot I suggest getting a pass, otherwise it's like $5 a ride, it was totally worth it for us), 10 min to China town. Since it is up nob hill, walking anywhere means going up/down hills. We didn't mind it but if you hate walking up/down hills this might not be for you. --Being away from union square I never had a problem with beggars or people I thought might mug me. We saw a few crazier looking people every now and then, but they never bothered us and from everything I've heard, the trouble is more down in tenderloin and some other districts on the other side of Union square. I actually saw quite a few college aged kids walking around the area. 6. Breakfast: We really enjoyed the breakfast here, although I have had better breakfasts at other hotels. They offered a variety of sliced fruits (melons, etc.) and some standard fruits (apples, bananas, etc.). They always had hot oatmeal. They also had quiche. I had it hot and recently brought out all but one time, so I guess I had good timing. I can see why some people would have complained about the cold quiche. I at the last slice once and I think it had been sitting there for a while. It wasn't the best but it still tasted all right. They also offer a variety of cold cereal, orange juice, coffee, etc. They usually have some sort of breakfast meat as well, usually sausage or sausage patty. Once again, these items were great when hot, but sometimes they were sitting out for a while. 7. The Cookie Jar: When you first come in and go up the small flight of stairs to the front desk, there is a cookie jar on an armoir at the top of the stairs. They usually stock that with great cookies/other baked goods and everynight when we came back there was some sort of dessert sitting by that jar, like bundt cake, lemon bars, etc. Needless to say we loved getting that little treat each time we came back. 8. The elevator: Yes, this elevator is an old elevator; one of those where you have to close an outer sliding door and inner gate in order for it to work. This goes back to the old world, european thing. We loved it and thought it was the cutest thing (it is decorated well and we never had a problem with it not working; just remember to close both doors after you exit). However, if you're looking for something more modern this might not be the place for you. Ok that was the longest review of all time. Overall we had a great experience there; we liked our room, had great service, and would definitely go back, especially if I got such a great deal again. But like I've said, it's for those who want that old, antique kind of experience. For those that want more modern, there are some other great hotels in SF that I'm sure you'll love.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "greensboro nc", "Title": "\u201cgreat inn within walking distance to everything\u201d", "Author": "luvmyyellowlab", "ReviewID": "UR5573345", "Content": "Stayed at the White swan Inn 2 nights the first week of August.

I got robbed out of my daily hot bath & wore flip flops in the shower so my feet didn't have to touch the black stuff. I asked to switch rooms, but the only one available with a refinished bathtub had a BROKEN FIREPLACE!!! Real classy. #2 If you have eyesight problems, don't try to watch TV. It's a million miles away from the bed. #3 The bed is REALLY comfy, but the rest of the room needs help. #4 Old, old, old elevator. #5 OK, ok... So it's within walking distance of Union Square & Chinatown. However, all the hotels along Powell Street (Westin St. Francis, Chancellor, etc.) are MUCH more convenient!!! If you want to stay off Powell, choose The Orchard. The saving grace of this B&B is the yummy breakfast buffet, the SUPERIOR wine/ fruit & cheese sampling at 5:00pm, and the adorable bellman, Louis.

Good breakfast and nice touch with the cheese and wine at \"tea-time\". Great place!

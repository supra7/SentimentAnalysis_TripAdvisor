I chose the location because it was only a mile from the school and is conveniently located right off of the high way. I was not interested in anything going on in the city, so it was perfect. There were not a lot of options around for food, but the employee at the front desk gave me a handy guide to local restaurants with directions included. Check in and out were both quick and easy. The hallways have a funky smell, and even though my room and the rooms around me were all non-smoking, there seemed to be a lingering smell of cigarette. It looks like the hotel may have been somewhat remodeled recently, unfortunately it appeared to have been done quick and cheap. The room was okay. I got a single king size which left plenty of space for luggage. The bed was comfortable. It was a very spacious room. The bathroom was clean and the bathtub drained. The whole hotel was very warm and humid. There was no air circulation in my room so I turned the fan on and immediately chunks of dust came flying out at me. It was so warm in the room that I left the fan on all night and slept without any blankets. The lobby is very nice. It looked like breakfast was offered in the same area. The employees at the front counter were very nice and helpful. The only odd things I encountered were the door handles and the other guests. You have to lift the doorhandles up, rather than down. I couldn't figure out why my door wasn't opening and had to ask for help, which made me feel pretty stupid. Also, it seemed that there were a good number of male construction workers staying at this location, and every single one that I encountered gave me the creeps. During my stay I did not see another female guest, which made me slightly uncomfortable.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cary, NC", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, Convenient to city\u201d", "Author": "scattt", "ReviewID": "UR120568961", "Content": "Wife, son, and I stayed here for a weekend band competition in Lucas Oil Stadium. No complaints. Hotel is showing a bit of age, but room was clean and staff was very nice. Breakfast area was crowded by 8 AM but food choices were pretty good and well stocked. It was no more than a 5 min. drive from the stadium, so convenience factor was high. We would stay there again. Only criticism is that the price - $120/night - seemed like it might be a little high compared to downtown rooms, but most of downtown was booked up for that weekend.

Very good value for the prices hotels in the area go for on that weekend. I'd stay there again if for one thing that still isn't resolved and has me hacked... we prepaid three rooms, but when we got there they could only find the prepay on two rooms and they charged my card for the third. Have tried to get it resolved many times since... they seem like they'll take care of it, but never do and I'm tired of calling back, so telling you. :) Since I paid for one room twice, not that good a value and I have to knock there service, although in other ways it was alright.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "m60freeman", "ReviewID": "UR115358278", "Content": "When I arrived at 10pm, I was greeted with free freshly made cookies, a fruit snack, and a bottle of water (because I was a member of their free Choice Privileges program, which I signed up for when I made my online reservation).

The room was fine, with a comfortable bed and plenty of pillows and towels. The free breakfast was advertised as continental but included waffles as well. Check-out was painless. It has no restaurant, but is surrounded by convenient places to eat. It is a budget property (it is a converted Holiday Inn Express) and I did not expect any place fancy.

But the Final Four was there and everything was sold out. I had an early meeting so I was fortunate to get something this close as it was less than five miles. The area is a little beat up, but not what I would deem \"unsafe\". The hotel istself was fine. It's an older property and I doubt it was a Holiday Inn when it was built. But the hotel was renovated and the rooms are clean, though a little small. There is a nice indoor pool and the property has no elevator. I paid the rack rate of $90 a night as priceline was not really taking bids due to the final 4. Would I stay here again? Probably not as I can priceline a 4 star hotel downtown for $50 most nights.

The service was great and the breakfast had a lot of options including a lot of pastries, cereal, yogurt and different choices of juice. The room was pretty nice and clean with the 2 queen beds being comfortable. There was a small table and 2 chairs which were great for playtesting for the the card tournament I was going too and the TV had a variety of channels. I was especially happy with a computer in the lobby that you could use for free, which also had free internet. The only problems were that the 2 days I came back I got notes saying that the staff could not clean my room fully because I left things laying on the bed. I don't really agree with this policy as it doesn't seem to be that much work to take the stuff off and put it back but I guess that's just me.

When we arrived the staff was friendly but we found the room to be not to our expectations in quality. We had extremely noisy neighbors from the room above us and at about 12:30 AM we heard popping sounds and realized that the bathroom in our room was being flooded from water pouring out of the ceiling. When we called the front desk he said that he knew and was the only one there to deal with the problem. I called the front desk again when he did not come to see the situation and later he arrived with some towels to mop up the water that was still dripping from the ceiling. This water was from the toilet upstairs and was everywhere including our toilet, towels, counter, toilet paper etc. When we said that we did not want to stay in that room he said that they had no other rooms. I then asked for our money back so that we could go to another hotel. After a delay he did refund our money but he offered no apology whatsoever.

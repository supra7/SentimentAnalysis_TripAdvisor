This Comfort Inn fills the bill nicely. The building is not new but there are signs that it is pretty well maintained and one of the rooms I had appeared to have been recently refurbished. I requested the 2nd or 3rd floor which seemed a little quieter. I found the staff to be very pleasant and accommodating and was particularly pleased with the way the room was cleaned. The free Wi-Fi had good signal strength in my room on some days, but not others. However, connecting in the lobby area was never a problem. The included breakfast was the expected juice, cereal, muffins, bagels etc. plus a waffle maker that was a nice extra. The breakfast room is fairly small and can get crowded, so I usually ate soon after they opened at 6:30AM. The neighborhood may put off a lot of people and you probably will not want to take a late evening stroll, but my wife and I walked to several nearby restaurants and had no problems or concerns. In fact during the afternoon the shops have a street market atmosphere, much like those we have seen overseas. A couple of restaurants we liked were Langer's Deli (Corner of 7th and Alvarado) that is open for breakfast and lunch only. They are fairly expensive but the food was good. Heading east on 7th about the same distance you can find a Little Cesar's Carry Out Pizza and to its left a delightful bakery and cafe (La Dolce Vita-1551 W 7th). La Dolce Vita serves salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes in addition to espresso and other specialty drinks and became our favorite spot for dinner.

I read the negative reviews after I had already booked the hotel so was prepared for a bad experience. I found the hotel clean and comfortable. The beds were firm, there was free internet with good connection speeds and the linen was changed each day with no problems. The cable connection was poor, with very fuzzy picture. The A/C didn't seem to pump out that much cold air. The temperature outside was high 60's so I don't know how the unit would do if it was hot and humid in the summer. The hallways that were carpeted were vacumed daily. The painted cement walkways were washed each day we were there. The ice machine and pop machine was down the hall and worked fine. The complimentary continental breakfast each morning was a nice freebie. The room was crowded each morning but I enjoyed the apple juice, bagels, bananas, tea and cold breakfast cereal. The last day was the least busy so I was able to get a hot waffle but most days it was too busy to wait for the waffle maker. The hotel was about 1.5 miles from Staples so it was a brisk 25-30 minute walk each way. The hotel is west of the high rise office buildings and definitely has mostly Mexican residents. The store fronts and apartments all have iron grills on the windows and the sidewalks don't look like they get cleaned often. We walked back from Staples each night around 11PM but didn't have any troubles or meet anyone that looked threatening. There were families with children waiting for buses and the only time we got scared was walking under the freeway. There was a street person sleeping under a big piece of cardboard. We thought it was just a pile of rags and were startled when he sat up. There was at least one person sleeping under the freeway each time we passed by. We were not approached by any panhandlers. The ticket scalpers near Staples were the only nuisance. We met an older couple who were staying there and they said they walked to Staples during the day and then took a cab home at night. They said there were lots of cabs lined up outside Staples and it was only around $8 for the ride home. This hotel is probably at the outside limits of where we would stay in the future for the Pac10 tourney. The hotel was a lot cheaper than the Holiday Inn across the street from Staples, where we have stayed in the past. The Comfort Inn hotel room was actually better but the location is the main attraction of the Holiday Inn. I would recommend this as a good value as long as you are comfortable staying in an inner city neighborhood. There were lots of schools in the neighborhood and it appeared to be safe to me during our 4 day stay.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin,Texas", "Title": "\u201cBED MITES\u201d", "Author": "BedMites", "ReviewID": "UR19515797", "Content": "BEWARE!

Being from Chicago I might not have felt as insecure in this neighborhood as someone from Salt Lake City. To some the economically disadvantaged locals are more scary then the character I felt they brought to the place. Aside from the homeless begging (of which there were more near the convention center then in this neighborhood) we had no problems in the neighborhood. The room was quite a different story. Shortly after check in we discovered the first cockroach. I called down to the desk and was told we could be moved to another room but it would be of lesser quality, which we found difficult to believe, and in close proximity. I left messages for the manager, then Wednesday, and twice a day until he called me on Saturday to inform me that he entered the room in my absence and without my permission. He had taken so long to return my call, he said, because he manages three properties. He saw nothing and would do nothing. Initially he told me that they have never had roaches in the hotel but later in the discussion mentioned that they were spot treating for roaches in another area of the hotel. When we returned that night we found another roach which we killed and bagged to be sent to Comfort Inn's corprate office. I attempted to speak to the manager for the remainder of my stay with no success. One bright and shining star was a young desk clerk named Tawnee. She attentively listened and transcribed my thoughts into a binder the manager was supposed to review. She attempted to get my room rate reduced, was approved by her supervisor, and denied by the manager. Only after I called Choice Hotels to begin the complaint process and under threat of sending the offending insect to Comfort Inn headquarters did my rate get reduced from $69.99 to $39.99.

If this weren't inconsiderate enough, I received a second call from the front desk at 3:45 am, in which the gentleman advised me that he called in error and proceeded to hang up.

Also, all night long doors slammed open and shut and questionable noises were heard in the room next door (use your imagination).

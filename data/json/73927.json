The person made absolutely no communication with us and it was even necessary for us to ask him where the room was. The room we were given was 115 and on opening the door we were immediately struck by the strong and disgusting odour of stale cigarette smoke. We noticed that there was cigarette burns on just about everything in the room. The deco was in the worst state I have ever seen at a Hotel, the carpet was worn, frayed and dirty. The place was far from clean. The smoke alarm cover was missing, as no doubt, someone had removed the battery in order to smoke. The bin in the room was in a disgusting state and the coffee machine was unusable due to its state. There were burn marks on the bathroom cabinets and the whole place was absolutely disgusting. The only reason we did not walk out was that we had been travelling for some 20 hours without sleep and very little to eat, we did not know the area and had no transport to go elsewhere. Because the place felt unsafe we found it necessary to put furniture in front of the door. With very little sleep, we could not get out quick enough. We did not see anything for breakfast nor did the person at reception offer us any. Without doubt this is by far the most disgusting Hotel I have ever been unfortunate enough to have to stay at. The only people that will give this a good review will be idiots!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williamsburg, Virginia, USA", "Title": "\u201cClose to Airport\u201d", "Author": "Posted by a cheaprooms.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127999701", "Content": "Hotel was great if you are arriving in Phoenix late at night or leaving early in the morning.....staff was very nice and accommodating...pick-up at AP was super quick as was return....would stay again.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carson, California", "Title": "\u201cHorrible experience\u201d", "Author": "Tracy W", "ReviewID": "UR127130749", "Content": "On 03/31/12, my friend and i checked in at this hotel.

The manager, Mr. Andy refused to give us a refund for one day and said that the bugs were ants. I know the difference between ants and flying little black bugs. The next day I attempted to contact Mr. Andy to discuss my experience at the hotel and getting a refund for one night however, he refused to speak with me and hung up the telephone in my face several times.

When I walked through the door to check out she said to the person on the phone, \"Oh hang on a second I have a customer.\" She continued to talk to this person as I checked out and when I asked how I get to the airport shuttle, she walked me outside (while still on the phone with her friend) and said, \"I am sorry I work and go to school..

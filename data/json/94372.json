My boyfriend and I had tickets to a concert at the House of Blues, so we decided to book a room here this past Wednesday. This was the day after the \"Boston Blackout\", so some of the city was still without power. After calling the concert venue to see if they had power (they did, concert was a go), I must have called the hotel 6-8 times, each time not getting any voicemail, just ringing and ringing. I also sent two e-mails and never heard back. Upon arrival, I could see the hotel was dark, and a small sign posted on the front door stating that the hotel was closed due to the power outage. I approached the front desk and was quickly told by an annoyed looking woman that my reservation for that evening was no longer valid. I was a bit taken aback by how rude she was off the bat. I asked her if they would be able to help me in getting another room in the city. She shot back that they had no power, how would she be able to help me with that? (This was said in between her texting on her cell phone). I asked what they were going to be able to do to help me, as I had booked the hotel because of its low rates, and most other rooms in the city would be upwards of $300. She once again told me that there was nothing she could do because \"ummm, I told you, we have NO power!\" and tossed me a piece of paper with the name and phone number of a hotel across the city (already booked up when we called). I completely understand why the hotel had to close due to the power outage, but it baffles me that they could not take a few simple steps to make lines of communication better (forwarding their phone lines to employees cell phones?) Also, it is shocking to me in that this hotel would not even try to do something to retain the business of those who were put out. Perhaps offering to rebook all the effected guests at partial or full cost to the hotel or even offering a complimentary or reduced nights stay at some point in the future? In the end, we were lucky enough to book at the Colonnade (can not recommend them enough, so kind and helpful!), no thanks to the awful staff at the Hotel Buckminster. I advise everyone to stay far away from this hotel that doesn't seem to care a bit about the satisfaction of their guests.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Nicole N", "ReviewID": "UR126117381", "Content": "I like the friendliness and helpfulness of the front desk staff.

When we approached the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised as it is located within a beautiful building. When checking in and out, all staff were friendly, efficient and knowledgable. The common areas were very well presented, and included vending machines, cash machine, laundry & kitchen areas, free wi-fi and also a computer room with printer - costing around $6 per 15mins use. The room was clean, but tired - although maintenance work was being carried out all the time, and clearly the rooms are slowly being improved (we were not disturbed by this work though). The view from the room reflected the area - which isn't picturesque, but pleasant enough. Inside, the room was spacious with plenty of storage, including a double wardrobe and seperate built-in cupboard. It also included tv (plenty of channels), microwave, fridge, safe, telephone, alarm clock radio, hairdryer. Bathroom was clean and tidy, with all the usual toiletries etc. Plenty of hot water and powerful shower. Breakfast was served in the adjoining restaurant, which can be accessed via the lobby, and therefore doesn't really feel seperate from the hotel, which is good. There is a good selection of items for a continental breakfast - waffles, bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, pastries, muffins etc. Again, staff were friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was great, with a subway station within two minutes walk. To get into town on foot, was a good 30 minutes, but a nice walk. This also takes you past the Cheers pub, various buildings and parks. Around the hotel, it seemed like a safe area and we felt comfortable walking about at night.

My main reason for choosing this hotel was because of its location and it exceeded my expectations in that dept. Here are my reasons:1) Location! I went to Boston for an overnight trip with my daughter and her friend to see a concert at the House of Blues. This hotel was right around the corner - no busy streets to cross. It is a stones throw from Fenway Park as well. It is a half a block away from the T (subway) stop which is approx. 5-10 min. ride to Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall. There are three restaurants, including Uno, attached to this hotel and there are quite a few others within a block's walk. Cambridge is a 3-5 minute drive or you can walk over the bridge (it has a walking path). Ten minute walk to Newbury(?) street (shopping). Easy access to the highway. 2) We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. It was plenty big for the 3 of us. You could have slept 6. It may have been tight for 6 people, but definitely do-able. One bedroom had a small kitchenette in with a table, desk, sitting chair. The other bedroom had 2 beds which filled it up. Because we were there for one night, I didn't need the tv. I did try turning it on and there was a problem with the signal. If it wasn't after midnight I would have called the desk, but I didn't bother. The bathroom was a little tight, but clean. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. I wasn't expecting that for such an old building. The character of the building was incredible. There is a fireplace (non working) in this suite. The decor left a little to be desired (no pictures on the walls), but again, we were there to sleep. 3) I paid $179 +tax and $28 for parking. I know the single rooms are less expensive. I thought it was worth it. Not knowing the city of Boston very well, I wanted to be close to the venue and that reason alone made it worth price. You get a continental breakfast which included cereals, muffins, danish, fresh fruit, coffee, tea. Certainly enough to get your day started. The desk staff was very helpful and pleasant. I do not think this hotel has much else by means of amenities (i.e. swimming pool), but I wasn't looking for that.

Our King-size bed was comfy, the TV was fine, with a reasonable selection of stations. The bathroom was ok, with real tiles. My only gripe was that, while the water pressure was good, it took a while for the water to reach a hot-enough temperature. Just start the water a few minutes before you are ready and all will be fine. Continental breakfast was garden-variety. Parking is an extra charge, but is immediately next door, so offers no inconvenience other than having to step outside to gain access. And what might it cost to park at Fenway? There is one elevator, which is small and requires negotiating a narrow passage to access, a small challenge when toting large baggage. What the Buckminster has to offer is location, location, location. We were there to attend Fenway, which was an incredibly convenient few blocks distant. Also, a T stop was a mere half-block away. That was particularly handy as well. There is a restaurant in the building, Uno. We ate there once and it was ok. The hotel is not cheap. It cost us about $200 a night. But for a nice older hotel, in a great location, that was not unreasonable. While the attendees at the game (yes, we are renegade New Yorkers who root for the Sawx) struck us as even ruder than our home town fans, the folks working at the hotel were models of courtesy and helpfulness. While we have stayed at nicer hotels in our time, The Buckminster is a great choice if you are in town for a game, and a nice choice even if you are there for other sights.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Hedland, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIt did the job (but only just)\u201d", "Author": "Bob-Carol-Hedland", "ReviewID": "UR120106142", "Content": "The room was smaller than most hotels we have stayed in whilst in the USA (and dearer) However our research had shown when we booked the hotel months ago that there really was nothing else available that suited our criteria.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.The hotel itself is modern enough, but still has the charm of an earlier era. The room, which they upgraded for reasons I don't understand but sure appreciated, was lovely. The bed was really comfortable. We had a suite, which meant a couch and a small table and chairs for two, in addition to the bedroom and bath. There was ample storage and a guest laundry on another floor. The best part was being so close to everything. From our window, we could see Fenway Park, baseball fans. We were within a few steps from the subway station at Kenmore Square. There were many restaurants nearby, at least 6-8 on that corner alone. Boston University was just across the street, as was the Barnes & Noble that serves as their bookstore. The breakfast was served the sushi restaurant just off the lobby. At street level facing the corner was an Uno's restaurant which serves super pizza.

We are budget travellers who appreciate comfort while trying to keep costs down. The Buckminster was the best deal in our US trip this year. For US $ 103 we got an ensuite 2 twin bed room with fridge and microwave plus an all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast. I simply do not understand all the complaints and fuss about a stain in the carpet. This is what I would call a perfect budget hotel, providing all a traveller needs. It is true that the furnishings are old fashioned and that the place would look much better and cost much more if it were completely refurbished, but from my point of view, let it be as it is. And the conveniences! We had a kitchen with an ice dispenser on the same floor, as well as a complete laundry room with washing and drying machine (a vending machine provides soap and softener). The room had a safe in the closet, a hair dryer in the bathroom (immaculately clean, all white), the room was well lit as there were large windows. The mattresses were comfortable. Towels were changed daily and room was always clean. Breakfast did not include cooked fare, but consider that it is a complimentary breakfast. Bagels, English muffins, Danish pastry, mini-cup cakes, four types of cereal, marmelades, honey, Philadelphia cheese , tea, cocoa, coffee, fresh fruit, orange and cranberry juice. A grill to toast bagles and muffins. I would not call that \"little variety\". Sure, if you are staying a month it might turn repetitive, but at that price, you can save enough to purchase whatever you want to add to the basic breakfast. We even saw guests who helped themselves to fruit and coffee and took it upstairs to their room. As regards service, this is the only hotel where we were greeted by our surname upon returning from sightseeing. So much so, that the second day I decided to memorize the name of the fellow who had taken the trouble to know who we were and where we were from. Thank you, Scott. We had trouble with the heating and the temperature in our room dropped to 61\u00c2\u00ba. We asked the situation be looked into, and reception promised to send the maintenance crew. However, that night the room was still cold. A different receptionist took our second complaint and this time someone did their job right, because the room was steaming when we returned. The business center is rather expensive but very convenient: you access it with your card key and use your credit card to buy internet connection time. There are two work stations and the chairs are comfortable. There are several restaurants within a 2 block radius (two in the same building as the hotel). Although there is a convenience store which sells pizza and other simple fare round the corner, the supermarket is a good 12-minute walk away. As regards location, although it is not in the heart of Boston, it is a 12/15-minute ride away on the green T-line. The station is Kenmore and it is 100 yards from there to the hotel. A word of warning to future guests: there are 4 green trains coming out of Boston center: only B (to Boston College), C (to Cleveland Circle) and D (to Riverside) take you to Kenmore. If you get on the E line, you never reach Kenmore because it turns south towards Heath. Going inwards, into town, all the trolleys stopping at Kenmore follow the same route so you can hop on the first one that stops. There are elevators that take you up to street level without having to lug your suitcases up the stairs. At Park Street you can transfer to the red T-line. With those two lines, you can move all over Boston, Harvard and MIT. We got a Charlie one-week Pass with unlimited trips for US$ 15 each. It works out even if you are staying only 4 days! Summing up, don't hesitate to book this place if you are cost conscious but want comfort and convenience.

Fifteen years ago my husband fondly remembered staying at the Buckminster, so for that reason, we ended up there. Of course I did my homework, and researched it on here. Generally we stay at Marriotts or high-end boutique properties, so I was a little leery about his selection of the Buckminster. Reviews were pretty varied, but I will echo the sentiment that this hotel needs serious updating. The elevators are small and old, the rooms (while large in size) were also old. The paint was an unflattering peach color which clashed with the purple floral bed covers and the green (i think) carpets. We sprung for a two bedroom suite and in our main room there were two bay style windows that overlooked Fenway. Great view, but when we opened the window to get some fresh air in, we were pretty shocked to discover that one of them was missing a screen. Being on the fifth floor in a room most likely used by families I thought this was unsafe and unacceptable. The bathroom was clean, although the fixtures appeared to be a bit outdated. All in all, I would not return to this hotel. Bed linens are pretty important to me, and I really like the all white duvet, triple sheet-ed look of some of the other main chain hotels or boutiques. The front desk staff, namely a gentleman named Whitney were stellar though. They deserve to be working somewhere that is a bit higher caliber.

The hotel is located within spitting distance of Boston University, Fenway Park, House of Blues and the Kenmore Square T, and it's a decent, very pretty walk to Newbury Street, the Hynes Convention Center and the Prudential Tower. We visited Boston in late September, when the walking weather is at it's best, and it was a cinch getting around town. The service is top-notch, too - very friendly staff, attentive housekeeping, and when we had an issue with our room, someone was there within 10 minutes. On the flip side, do not expect too much of the room itself. You'll get what you need: a bed, a desk, a chair, a bathroom, and there was a microwave and minifridge in the room, as well. However, there was no coffee maker, a tiny 13-inch TV, and an extremely spotty internet connection. The hotel offers one hour of free internet per day at very slow speeds (one day we couldn't even load email) - any more time or speed, and you'll have to buy it. There are a number of free networks floating around - if you can catch one, I recommend using that instead. If all else fails, and you need to connect, there's a Barnes and Noble across the street. We can't complain too much - the price was outstanding for the convenience. I just wish we could have left the window open at night (the room overlooked the Turnpike as it feeds into Back Bay). The free breakfast is your typical continental - coffee, bananas, bagels and danish. I'd recommend heading over to Trident Books and Cafe on Newbury Street for breakfast, instead. It's packed on weekends, but quiet during the week, and their menu is awesome. I'm sure there are reviews here - check them out. All-in-all, if you're looking for a place to rest your head at night after a day of touristing, shopping, watching the Sox, or dropping your kid off at BU, the Buckminster is a pretty good choice.

The temperature control (or lack there of) is the only major drawback; our room was warmer than we like it, but not uncomfortable.

I booked my room through one of the online travel sites - the one that tells you where you're staying after you pay. My wife and I landed our room at the Buckminster Hotel. Pros - Location is excellent. Right next to Fenway Park and Kenmore Train Station. Lot's of great nightlife, safe place in the city, and good places to eat. I have to say that booking through a travel site, I was able to get a room here for $63.00 a night. That's a HUGE value in a good part of Boston. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. Cons - Our room was about 12'x14' - I'm not exaggerating. The worst part is we did not have control of our thermostat. I called the front desk and told him I wanted to turn the air on - he told me they can turn it on from the outside of the room. Sure enough, 10 minutes later our air was working, however our thermostat still didn't work. After several hours of the air on full blast and the room becoming ice cold, I had to call the front desk and tell them to turm my air off. They made no apologies at all for this inconvenience and acted like this was acceptable. My wife was keeping me calm reminding me that all we needed was a bed and a shower and this place did provide that much. We had a great time in Boston and look forward going back in the spring.

Our friends booked a room with the hotel thinking it would be a great place to stay, especially with the proximity to Fenway. To start with, my wife called the night we were to arrive with a question regarding parking, right off the bat the guy she was on the phone with told her that if she had a problem with their parking policies that he would just cancel her reservation. My wife hadn't even started to complain yet or give her name, she just mentioned she had a question. Once we arrived, we discovered that the hotel doesn't have it's own parking, they rent spaces from a tiny garage which is next to the hotel. Parking is first come, first serve and if the Sox are playing you more than likely won't get a space. Thankfully we managed to squeeze in but this is a fact we should have been made aware of ahead of time. We had two nights booked, the first was so/so, the beds are very hard and uncomfortable and the pillows might as well not be there, they provide no support at all. As for the second night, we were on our way back from Fenway after seeing the Sox smash the Yanks and as we were about to walk into the building, some fool from the 3rd floor decided he was going to throw things out the window. He had already thrown a pillow out, then proceeded to dump a cup of water on my wife. We approached the front desk staff with the issue and they said that there was nothing they could/would do and that if we wanted it taken care of, we'd have to call the police. I don't think he expected us to call, but we did. So Boston PD showed up. The front desk clerk tried to play off what happened but BPD convinced them they needed to take care of their customers. We were able to determine what room they issue came from and with persuasion from BPD finally got an apology from the staff. It shouldn't have taken us calling the police for them to address unruly guests. If it were my hotel I would want to make sure it was addressed so that this type of thing doesn't bring down the reputation of my facility. Needless to say, between this and issues we had with parking, i.e. the parking attendant locking our car key in his booth and then going home for the night, we decided not to stay for the second night and instead went home.

We stayed in a suite consisting of 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. One room had a queen size bed and the other room had two double beds. The rooms are in need of renovation. The walls are dirty, smudged and it's apparent that the plaster has seen many years of repairs. But the beds are clean! Each room has a small color TV with cable.

The parking garage is located next to the hotel (on the same side of the street) as the hotel.

The MBTA station (Kenmore) is located across the intersection, a few steps away from a Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds. Of course, the hotels proximity to Fenway Park is the biggest reason for Red Sox fan to stay here, though the Hojo's on Boylston is closer and comparable in quality. There is a freeyou may hear the fire alarm going off around 6am. The front desk said this is common. Perhaps a way to get checkouts up and out?

I suppose Victorian is just a nice way of saying old. Yes, true, Boston is an old city ...with a tremendous amount of charm. I actually loved Boston. However, for the price you pay at Buckminster, old hard beds with musty smelling sheets and a stand alone sink with NO counter space at all in the bathroom leaves something to be desired. I do have to say that the breakfast at the teeny little restaurant (and I do mean teeny) downstairs was actually quite tasty. To their credit, they were renovating the lobby at the time, but still that seem to have no bearing on the old hard beds and must sheets.

Things we loved were that the hotel was literally across the Turnpike from Fenway Park and right on Commonwealth Ave, the low rate (159.00) for a king suite within city limits and the proximity to the subway. All those things are as advertised and the hotel is a great spot to have as a home base. We stayed on the 5th floor of the 6 floor hotel. The elevator although a little small was clean and not slow. The king bed was newer, firm and very comfortable to sleep in. The living room was nice to have as we like to spread out and that's nearly impossible if you just have a single room with a bed. The hotel (what we observed) itself was NOT dirty and dingy or smelly. The room was clean with only some dust on the high dresser in the bedroom. Behind the bed was clean(always a sign of lazy cleaning when dirty) and vacuumed. The double windows and shutters did dampen some of the inner city noise but not all( hey, it's a BIG city). We expected some traffic noise considering it's location and were not bothered by what did come through. The room (all of them ) had a working refridgerator and microwave and there was a clean, large cooking area with sinks and a stove on each floor. When we had to deal with the staff they were all courteous and helpful. The weather temperature was perfect so we needed no heat or air conditioning so I can't rate how they worked. Self parking was readily available for 18.00 a day right next door and the attendant there was courteous. There were some slight spotting on the room carpet but nothing drastic at all. My biggest and probably only complaint was the bathroom towels. They were not up to snuff as they were thin, old, and although cleaned and hopefully bleached, were spotted, as were the replacements that were given to us without a problem. I would suggest bringing a couple of your own towels or do as we did, dry off with some clean, extra tee shirts. The continental breakfast is nothing but some tupperwares filles with bread, bagels,muffins, etc served inside the attached Japanese restuarant and we passed on it. McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts are both right next door and will fill the gap for you. We live just 90 miles away in W. Massachusetts, so we know the area well and I can tell you from experiance that this is a good location to have as homebase for a few days, especially if you don't like driving alot. As stated earlier , the subway (Green Line/Kenmore Station) is just a couple blocks from The Buckminster and can take right to most attractions in the city including North Station where you can get a commuter train and will take you to just about any cities that are around Boston from Plymouth to Glouchester/Newberryport to Providence, RI..

If it was not such a busy long weekend in the Boston area, we would have cancelled our reservation immediately. This hotel is well below average, especially in a city such as Boston where there are so many great hotels to choose from. The hotel is in the middle of rennovations, which are apparent as soon as you walk in the front door. There is plywood in the lobby, and duck tape holding down the carpet/rug. There are two halls as narrow as one person on each side of the front desk leading to small four person elevators. One of the elevators was not working for the majority of our stay. We had a 1BR suite, with 3 beds. The layout of the room was excellent with enough space to not feel crowded. The condition of the room was horrific. The carpet in the room looked as though it had been a murder scene. Large dark spots where something had obviously sat in disgust for a very long period of time. In the main bedroom, there are two large windows. Only one of the windows actually had a curtain, which made for a very unappealing visual. The view was of the highway, with Fenway Park in the backdrop. If it weren't for the great view of Fenway, this review would have been worse. Behind the tv armoire was a dirty tube sock, apparently from a recent visitor. The comforter had some mysterious stains with texture. There was one thermostat for the room, but apparently it did not actually adjust the air/heat. We set our thermostat on 68 degrees, and after several hours we returned to our room to see that the temperature was well over 85 degrees, with the heat \"just a blowin.\" After two calls to the front desk, the heat was finally turned off from the front desk. Hotel Buckminster obviously has full-time residents, and there were several very sketchy residents on the 6th floor. One decided that the television should remain on, at full volume for four consecutive days. This became a large nuissance at night when we were trying to sleep over the highway truck noise and construction. Another very interesting resident decided to walk down the hall in nothing but his boxer shorts to do his laundry. This made for very uncomfortable women in our group. The amenities include continental breakfast of instant coffee that you make yourself downstairs, or access to the connecting japanese/sushi bar, which runs karaoke until 2am.

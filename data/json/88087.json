I will begin by saying that people were complaining that the breakfast buffet was pricy. Wll 3 adults and 2 kids who eat free, was a whopping $35.00! That to me is great, nowhere here in Edmonton can 5 people get a breakfast anywhere for that price. The food was good and hot and there was a great slection of your typical breakfast foods including fruit and yogurt. Okay now the hotel. Yes it may be more like a motel but who cares, We booked a kids suite with our pacakge and then after I saw the 2 room suites. We checked on at 9:00 am on a Saturday and I asked if we could upgrade. Yes no problem $20 more a night......done and done! The room was older, again wasn't there to hang in the room but it was huge, couch and murphy bed for Grandma on the living area, there was a bar area with a fridge and microwave. Then the bathroom was again hige and very clean. The maids were very good at leaving extra towels as they must have noticed there were 5 of us. Then there was the bedroom, again huge, 2 double beds and a closet and its own air conditioner as well. Also had a table and chairs. We were on the 2nd floor room 800 and it overlooked one of the pools. Not the one with the bar but that was okay it was a quick walk. The staff was very friendly throughout the hotel, everything was clean the pools were really nice. The food in the food court was good, lots of choices and the grocery part was also very handy and reasonable priced. There are so many restaurants around the hotel that the kids eat free at if they are 10 or under and it is a short drive to the Disney Parks as well. Location, location, location that is for sure. Would I stay there agan, in a second and I will tell everyone I know that they should stay at the Seralago as well. We travel a lot and I know that there are always nicer and fancier hotels to stay at and by all means if people want to spend the money to stay at a Disney Hotel then good for them. Personally I like to find hiddem gems like the Seralago and stay there and be able to afford many family vacations a year.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cgreat time at seralago\u201d", "Author": "ricky b", "ReviewID": "UR128441369", "Content": "Great family resort.

We stayed in room 102. It had 2 double beds. First , the tv kept shutting off on it's on. The maintenance came while we were out. Not sure what they did. But it didn't fix it. Then the picture started getting distorted every now and then or it was going to a snowy picture, like the cable went out. We told maintenance and he said he would have the manager on duty call us. Didn't happen! I got back in the room in the evening, had a drink and a candy bar. Sat it down on the night stand for about 5 minutes, and ants were all over it! The maid service was great! Monica did a great job. When we checked out, we told the manager on duty about our problems, he said he couldn't do anything about the tv! He couldn't comp us nothing for that! He did comp us the drink and candy bar I lost by letting me pick out a drink and candy bar at the store they have in the lobby. I expected better customer service from them! Their motto on the literature in the room says they will make the customer happy whatever it takes! Crap! And they also state in the brochure that the pools are heated, that's crap too! The pool was cold at night! We asked about that also to no avail! I did loveeee the spa/hot tub! It was very relaxing at night! The rooms were nice but a little outdated. The bathroom had painted tiles on the walls.And the room had a working fridge and microwave that came in handy. They did have a shuttle to Universal. It was great. But if you do ride the shuttle, make sure you tip the driver that takes you and picks you up. The drivers are different from each trip. I gave them a dollar each trip. I didn't have much, but I gave what I could. He had to do a pick up from a high end hotel, and no one tipped him anything! I don't think these guys make much! Hey! The shuttle is free.

The kids pool, playground and game room were wonderful ways to wind down after visiting the parks. The food that was offered was good (especially their pizza-- LOVED IT!) although I did not pay to eat their breakfast as it was pricey compared to other buffets just a few buildings down in either direction. Their shuttle service is convenient, with several pick-up and drop-off times. Staff was very friendly. It isn't a secret that the hotel needs some renovations; the curtains were obviously in need of cleaning with black mildew on their surfaces, the bathroom had dirt all along the top frame of the door (again, easily seen even for someone of my grand height of 5 feet). Bottom line: the kids enjoyed it, which is what counts in my book.

Yes it is fairly basic, but had all you need in the room, including a microwave and coffee maker, but, but much than a similar priced hotel in the UK. We arrived one evening ready for a day at Disney the next, with departure the following day (two nights). The children loved the kiddies pool and playground, our adult son found the main pool just right first thing in the morning for a serious training session. The free shuttle buses to Disney were on time and the journey wasn't far, two shuttles in the morning 8am and 11 am, we got the 11am one and were in the Magic Kingdom in half an hour. Disney was just as bad as we imagined (Easter Break) with long queues and rip off prices, but hey that's Disney. The kids couldn't wait to get back to the hotel and the pool. Grandad very sensibly stayed at the Hotel and enjoyed his day relaxing by the pool with a good book.

Each day the soap was tossed out and a fresh bar was left, as well as a fresh bottle of shampoo, even if the first was half full. Towels were aplenty, changed daily. At the large pool there were plenty of towels available as well. The towel bin was kept full all day for your use. There was a good sized hot tub, and an additional pool in the other area of the property. The main pool had a great bar and food pavillion for reasonable prices, with a daily drink special. We ate the juicy hamburg/fries special at the pool several times, even splitting it once as it was so big. It was spring break so a lot of families were there, but we didn't find it too noisy or too crowded. Food was available on site for breakfast and other meals, and many restaurants within walking distance made in unnecessary to have a car. (KFC, Red Lobster, Italian, Ponderosa, Burger King, McDonalds) There was a small grocery store walking distance down the street as well as a liquor store. Their free shuttle to the parks was convenient. We did not find any bugs in the room or anywhere. The property was relatively clean, did find some cigarette butts on the pool deck which apparently does not get swept each night, but chaises are always realligned.

Very busy because the American children had started their spring break, lots of teenagers at the hotel, however we didn't experience any noise at night the complex was quiet. On arrival we were unable to have our rooms together as requested, but a very helpful gentleman on reception changed our rooms, so the 2 rooms booked were only 5 rooms away which was quite acceptable. We had a king suite which had a sofa and a fridge and microwave. Bed a bit on the firm side for me, but that's just my preference. The furniture a bit worn in places as you would expect from the large turnover of people that stay here, but paintwork and carpets were clean. Rooms were cleaned adequately and towels changed daily. Unfortunately no safe in the room but they supply a free of charge safety deposit box at reception, this was a bit inconvenient but very safe and always somebody to attend to you, no waiting. This is a very large hotel complex and our room was quite far from the reception, bar and restaurant area, but usually we were in our car and could just pop in to reception on our way out or home in the evening. There are a couple of pools, didn't use them, but the area seemed lovely and they were always well used. We walked a few evenings for meals and drinks to the Old Town which is located about 10mins walk from the hotel. Also many shops and restaurants across the road.

There's an arcade, small shop and restaurant in the lobby and the guest services had lots of great advice and sold attraction tickets right there. And there were tons of restaurants and small attractions within walking distance.

However, this hotel warrants it. I felt the need to say STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP! I was surprised that it received so many rave reviews. This has to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. Don\u2019t let the nice pictures on their website fool you. It\u2019s old, worn out, smelly and dirty. The front desk staff wasn't overly friendly and didn\u2019t go out of their way to be helpful. The first maintenance man we encountered was surly and rude. The second was a very nice guy as was the bartender by the pool. We were in a 2nd floor room right next to the stairwell. With the old metal steps and paper thin walls, we heard every person who came and went. Most of them sounded as if the were wearing heavy boots and stomped their way up and down the stairs. The room was dirty and smelly. The bed coverings had seen better days and should have been replaced 10 years ago. We thought the \u201ckids suite\u201d would be great for our 2 year old but she pronounced it \u201cdirty, dirty, dirty\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d we had to bribe her to get her to sleep there. The lighting in the entire room was poor. Only 2 lights worked making the whole room dreary. We did not feel comfortable opening the curtains since the window faced the walkway going past our room. We used the TV for light. While the TV was on, about every half hour, something would happen with it and it would get snowy, go off then come on again to the Lifetime channel, no matter what channel it was on when it went off. Being a Disney good neighbor hotel, I expected more Disney programming but it was limited to one Disney Channel. There was a small refrigerator and a microwave located next to the bathroom sink. The fridge, no matter the setting froze everything and the microwave didn\u2019t work. There was a coffee maker but no coffee. The first night, the sink began to leak as it drained. We used towels to clean up the mess and called the front desk. It took 4 calls. During the 4th call in 3 hours, they claimed maintenance already fixed it. They finally came at 10:55 pm to unclog it, even though it wasn\u2019t clogged, it was leaking. On the initial call we requested clean towels. Over the course of the 3 hours, we received 4 towels 4 different times (all brought by the same guy). We ended up with 16 towels! The second morning we were there, the toilet overflowed. Maintenance was on top of things and said the toilet needed to be replaced and it would be done while we were gone. When we returned that evening nothing had been done so we requested a room change. They could not accommodate us so we cut our vacation short and came home. On our first evening there we ordered food from the bar area by the pool in which they automatically add a 18% tip for calling your name to come up to the window to get your food. The food was just okay and over priced. The heated pool was only heated on the first day and was very pleasant to swim. The next day it was chilly. We were told the heater wasn\u2019t working and if we didn\u2019t like it, we didn\u2019t have to swim in it. The only plus I could find was it is very convenient to the Disney Parks\u2026if you drive. The shuttle times are limited, crowded and inconvenient. I guess things could be worse, like the lady we met at check out who had been locked in her room for 3 hours because she couldn\u2019t the door to unlock. It took maintenance an hour to show up and then a couple of more to figure out how to take the door off the hinges.

The shuttles in Feb were not at all convenient though, so if you are relying on those, either plan on getting up at 7:30, or be late for the Disney and Universal openings. We had a car, so that was a bonus, as the shuttles left at 8:50 or 10:50, and not a minute later. We arrives to catch a shuttle at 8:51, and it was gone. The bonus was the fridge and microwave in the room, which you dont get at Disney hotels, as well as the closeness to Walmart ( with a car). The one thing that bugged me was that being I was a single mom with 2 kids, there was a thin door between me and the adjoining room, which kinda was freaky. The walls are thin... We didnt go to the front of the hotel at all, so I cant comment on the service or restaurants, it was too far of a walk (15 mins), so we stuck to the back end.

The lobby does not look like a 3-star lobby. However, the little general store and cafeteria was a plus. We did not use the pools or any other amenities that were available as we were only there one night. There is outside entry to the rooms. I also noticed they had a breakfast buffet for only $7.95 in a restaurant. We did eat at the buffet the morning we checked out and it had the basics\u2026eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, pancakes, fruit, muffins, etc. and it was not too bad. Drinks were extra. We ate on Sunday and apparently on the weekends they don\u2019t offer the a la carte menu\u2026only on week days. However, be aware they automatically add a 18% tip for basically just bringing you drinks. I thought this was a bit much considering we did most of the work being it was a buffet. In fact, we just ordered coffee and she sat two cups and a little pot of coffee on our table so that was the end of her service for us. As mentioned 18% is a bit much for so little service. We did not see anything posted that this was going to happen\u2026just was surprised to see it when we got the ticket. We got the standard room with two double beds. I was surprised to see there was a small refrigerator and a microwave. Strangely though there was no coffee maker and the only way to get coffee in the morning was to pay for it at the store or order it at the buffet. The room was clean and average. The beds were seemingly old because when we sat on them after entering the room we bounced up and down. We both sank down when lying down and had to sleep in separate beds to avoid really sinking in. My biggest concern was I would not let my children play in the room because there was a rusty, metal door stop. It looked like some kind of metal piece you would buy at Hope Depot and it was bolted into the floor. The door stop was flat and was even sharp at the edges. I did not notice it until I was right on top of it walking by the door and literally stepped right on it with my shoe! Thank goodness. I am sure if I was barefoot or even in socks I would have cut my foot to the point of needing stitches and maybe even needing shots because as I mentioned it was rusty. Talk about unsafe. We literally put the phone book on top of it so neither of us would accidentally step on it again. Also, it surprised me so much when I stepped on it, I lost my footing and almost fell. Good thing I was not wearing sandals or flip flops! One plus I will mention though is we saw security everywhere which made us feel safe especially because we did not get back to our hotel room until after midnight. The staff was friendly and when we called the front desk to ask for a luggage rack, it was brought to the room immediately. The location is very close to the major attractions, shopping, and restaurants.

This hotel is clean and very well-kept, and the per-night prices are unbeatable. It is an off-Disney property, but the ride in to any of the Disney parks is short and very convenient, whether you take your car or the hotel's complimentary shuttle. It's a longer drive to Universal and Sea World, though. If you're planning to go to those parks, I would choose a closer hotel. However, if the majority of your time will be spent at Walt Disney World, and you'd rather not pay much for hotel accomodations, the Seralago is ideal. Understand that the hotel is not fancy, and is not themed like the Walt Disney World hotels. However, the Disney hotels are ridiculously expensive. The Seralago is basically just a place to sleep with great pools and recreation. One great thing about the Seralago is its location. It's right next to Old Town, which has shops for grownups and plenty of rides and attractions for kids. The newly opened Fun Spot is there, too, with its terrific carnival rides. Actually, parents will want to ride these old rides, like the Tilt-A-whirl, just for the sheer nostalgia factor. As far as safety goes, the Seralago has a dedicated safety office right on property, and security guards patrol the grounds at night on golf carts. I have stayed here many, many times and I've always felt secure. So, if you really want a lovely, spotless, themed hotel on Disney property, by all means go there, but be prepared to pay hundreds of dollars per night (note that the Disney budget hotels are not all that elaborately themed, and the rooms are very small; there are ALWAYS screaming kids all over the place, too!). If you'd rather not spend a lot on a hotel, are willing to ride a bit to the parks, and you can accept the fact that this is just a hotel, the Seralago is for you.

I don't think so. They offered me another room, I was settled in by then, if they had came when they said they would, I would not be unpacked, or they said go out for four hours and we will spray it, thunderstorms outside and torrential rain, so that option was knocked on the head. Functional room with a fridge and microwave, which was a godsend. The 'food court' was a counter in the gift shop that was so dis-organised, they took one order at a time, cooked it, then took another order. Pool area was nice, good atmosphere and clean. The furniture in the room had seen better days and the beds were sunken in the middle. I had a lovely maid, Eliza. I stayed for 8 nights, would go back for a cheap no frills holiday. The surrounding area has changed so much, a lot of hotels and attractions shut down. Old Town used to be so atmospheric and nostalgic, not now, It is characterless, big investors have put in rollercoaster type rides, it has lost its quaintness, if you want rides etc, go to the big disney parks, Old Town is silly trying to compete.

We found the hotel staff extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was on the ground floor, spacious enough for the 4 of us. We didn't use the microwave, but the fridge was clean and we used that daily. The room did smell a little damp, but I put that down to the sheer humidity in Orlando? We had clean towels every day. Bedding could have been better, (some cigarette burns on top blankets) but was sheets were clean. Buffet Breakfast was excellent, filling and just too much by the end of our 2 week stay! The restaurant staff were so friendly they seemed like actors, but since they managed to keep it up every day for 14 days, we know they're genuinely \"nice people\" so we were happy to tip them. If we didn't have change - we didn't notice any drop off in their attitudes. We ate lunch in the restaurant on one of our rest days and it was pretty pricey (as you'd expect from any hotel really), but portions were true American size and the food tasted good. It was a burger/microwave heat up type of restaurant which was ok for lunch. The only piece of advice I'd give the management is - get rid of those disgusting sofas in the reception!!! They were once lime green leather suites, but now are simply blackened, cracked leather and are so unappealing. I didn't notice them when we arrived - I was too anxious to know our booking transfer had gone smoothly (and it had). But my husband noticed them straight away and didn't really want to stay there if they proved to be a reflection of the general cleanliness. Thankfully, they didn't. But really - bin them. They're not adding to the decor and their right in the reception area! They need to go!! No chairs would be better than those. Pools seemed very popular with guests -from first thing at breakfast time until quite late at night - we were just too dead tired after Disney/Universal etc so didn't actually use them at all. Rooms are air conditioned and the unit we had worked excellently. Room service staff were honest and friendly, if not great with English language, since most of them spoke Spanish, but this didn't matter at all - honesty is the priority when you're leaving your things in their care while you're gone. The gym is really just a tiny room with 4 pieces of equipment, so my husband gave that a miss - although given how tired we were (this was our first trip to Orlando) I don't really think he would have had any energy left to use it anyway no matter how big it was. The real bonus of staying at Seralargo was being right next to \"Old Town\". The hotel's in a fantastic part of Orlando where every Saturday night car enthusiasts bring out their beautifully and lovingly restored cars dating back from 1920s and 30s, '57 chevvies, cadillacs, dodges, right up to VW beetles and campervans. It's incredible and you get to see a real piece of the US. Locals come out, music is played everywhere and there's lots of great fun fair rides for everyone (if you haven't had enough of rides already!) There's some absolutely death defying bungee rides if you're really daring or downright suicidal! And a fantastic atmosphere, and not one piece of rubbish on the floor in the whole area, despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of people walking about and lots of food, drinks, sweets etc on sale! It couldn't happen in England. And best of all there's a parade of the cars just before they leave so you can hear the roar of their engines. I loved it and I'm no car enthusiast! We'd have missed all this if we'd stayed on Disney! Seralargo gets my vote and it's only 1.3 km from Disney I think. We'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. There's a cinema room where kids can select whatever film they like. Ours never used it since they were always too tired and we had a TV in our room anyway with a million channels. There's a games room in the reception area - our 2 kids loved that - there's an ice hockey table, simulator games etc. They spent a few hours having fun in there. Great hotel all in all.

I called the front desk and the girl apoligized and said she would send someone right away. A security came, but coulndt fix it. I decided to go the front desk, obviously pissed off at that point, but I have to say the little moslem girl at the front desk made me forget i was even mad. She was so sorry to me and my family. she told me she would get me into a new room right awya and have security help us move which they did she upgraded us to a room by the pool for free which my kids loved. she also have us free breakfast for the next morning which my kids also enjoyed she was really the sweetest little thing ever. she most be on something to be so nice and cheerful at that hour of the night though Anyways to say the least, our stay was very good and enjoyable after that and i really shouldnt have been to mad in the first place with the front desk or security. nonw of us can control technology. would stay again, happy kids,equals happy me and great price", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cNever go back\u201d", "Author": "disneyrocksFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR116387487", "Content": "Once again, we go to Disney often.

The room was cleaned daily (including clean towels, soap and shampoo). I would guess that the hotel was built in the 80s and has not been updated since but you are paying for a cheap place to stay, about 7 miles from Disney and 14 miles from Universal. We did not hear noise from any other guests and parked our hire car directly outside our room. We had a room with 2 double beds, a bathroom with shower over the bath and also a small fridge and microwave, hairdryer and iron/ ironing board. You do need to take own (or buy) plates, cutlery etc and there is no kettle - we bought a pirex jug and heated water in microwave (although if we go again would take a travel kettle). We found that the hairdryer didn't work at 9:30pm, we informed reception and it was replaced by 9:40pm. There are 2 swimming pools with towels provided, one with an area for small children and a bar. Both pools were fairly quiet but we found that the other pool was more quiet and 50 metres for the laundrette. I would put in a load of washing go for a swim for 30 minutes, go back and put clothes in the dryer and go back to pool for 45 minutes. We did not use the very small shop or cafe etc. Seralago is right next to old town. On Saturday nights they have old cars there, we didn't find this out until the Sunday so didn't go. Between Seralago and Old town you will find a small supermarket (although if you have a car Walmart and other larger supermarkets are within 3 miles), KFC and Pizza hut. Opposite is Macdonalds, Dennys and Pondarossa. You must try Pondarossa at least once for breakfast. All these are within very easy walking distance. Golden Corral is great value (out of main entrace turn left past the first major junction, on right side of road about 1mile). While there is a Chinese buffet opposite near Macdonald, on our last day we did find Icheban, we wished we'd found before. Out of main gate, turn right approx 3 miles on left side of road. It is great value but can also get discount by picking up discount ticket books from Seralago. Also went to Chillis twice (not as cheap) about a mile further on from Iciban on opposite side of road. We would certainly recommed Seralago. If what you want is a place to stay while you visit Disney, Universal etc it was great.

I like having a mini-fridge and microwave however, I think next time I would prefer a more updated room with a full range kitchen. the room was outdated one of my lights in the room didn't work becuase the socket wasn't working either so the room wasn't that well lit.

Here is a brief overview of my stay followed by an extremely detailed review: 1. I was lied to about the fact that grills were on the property. Went out bought my own grill. Was told that I couldn't grill on the property even after being told that I could. Wasted my money. 2. Whirlpool tub didn't work. 3. Sister's I.D. was stolen from our room. 4. Someone took a -- in the pool twice while I was there. 5. Both air conditioning broke in our 2 room suite and had to be completely replaced. 6. Unsure of how clean the pools are. 7. I say the sleep quality was average. Cleanliness was average (found left over items from other guests I give it a 2 star on value. The Spa was nice. Not great, but nice. The swimming pool served it's purpose, however, I have a habit of nibbling my upper and lower lips and tasted saltiness while I was in the pool. Pool water should not be salty... From close up the water looks normal but from far away it has a green tinge. I'm developing a rash. Not sure if those 2 things coincide. Just as a warning: IF you're planning on staying here for 1 night, you might just be okay, but it's not good for an extended stay. If you're just tired and want to get off the road and have a hot shower that's all this place is good for. You'll see a lot of reviews that'll say the hotel is outdated and it's very true. Personally, I like an 80s vibe in places. If you're looking for a modern hotel, you will be sorely disappointed. Even to look at it it's really old. Sort of like the hotels that become home to crack heads and fugitives. Now, on with the in depth review. First of all, I want to say that despite several problems that I incurred at this hotel, I was willing to give it at least a 3 star review because the problems were minor. However, on a grander scale, putting it all together made me realize this hotel doesn't deserve 3 stars. I will start off by saying that the reviews here are so mixed because some of these issues are not going to effect everyone, however, it is important to know that staying at this hotel will be risky because any one of the negative reviews could apply to you. My mistake was thinking that I'd be one of the lucky few. Okay, to start, we booked a 2 Room Suite for $85 a night plus $25 taxes for a 3 night stay through \"Stayhereplayhere.com\" - Its' even cheaper if you agree to do a time share. We had a whirlpool tub in our room which was a very nice size. Very roomy, however, the jets did not work so basically it was nothing but an over sized tub. The next day of our first stay, my sister's photo I.d. went mysteriously missing while we were all out. We literally checked every corner of the suite and it was gone and there is a pending investigation and based on other terrible ratings on this site, other people has experienced missing items as well. Again, I was hoping I'd be among the lucky... Before booking the Room, I knew I'd need to do some bar-b-queing so that our family would have something to eat for dinner on one of the nights we stayed. I was pressed for time and it was looking more and more likely that I wouldn't have the time with my proceeding schedule in the coming days so I called the hotel and asked if they had Grills on the property. I was told that they do. I was content and trusted the judgement of the upfront personnel who answered the phone. So we arrive to the hotel and on day 1, I didn't see any grills anywhere but I didn't need them at the time. Mind you, I have meat that has been marinating for 2 days and needs to cook before it spoils.... So by day 2, I absolutely needed to go ahead and get it on the grill. There are 2 pools. One in the back where I rooms were, And 1 in the front building where the standard rooms are.... When I didn't see any grills, I called up to the front desk to ask \"Where are your grills?\" - The girl at the desk gave a strange answer. She said, \"Usually by the pool.\" -- Evidently, she must have thought I asked, \"Where do we grill at?\" because I figure if the grills are by the pools, they either ARE or they're not. Anywho... We went to the pool in the back and realized there were no grills and we swam and decided to grill later. It wasn't until the next day, when we were informed the back pool was closed because someone actually used the bathroom in the pool (#2) but the front pool was opened. Now mind you, I know the hotel doesn't have control over what people decide to do... after all, we all have an expectation that people WONT do nasty things like that... but my disgust came with the fact that they only had a maintenance guy come and fish the feces out and the pool was opened no less than 12 hours later.... How in the hell could you have cleaned a pool thoroughly enough to be swam in again. This happened twice in the same pool during my 3 night stay, by the way. So anyway, after finding out the pool was closed, I decided this was an opportunity to see the grills at the front pool. Low and behold, there were no grills. I called back up to the front desk and was told there were no grills. Now, at this point, I've talked to 3 people about grilling and neither of them told me about an anti-grilling policy. IN FACT the first 2 lead me to believe that grills were not only at the hotel but were accepted. So as upset as I was, I was still going to give this hotel at least a 3. I had to go out and buy a temporary throw away grill from the store for $10 along with the coals and lighter fluid. On the last night, I proceeded to take my grill, meat, and supplies to the pool just outside of our room in the back and again, it was closed because someone had taken another -- in it. I made my way up to the front pool and set up everything and began grilling. We were grilling for a good hour and a half and everything was fine. Then up walks the maintenance guy who was extremely nice... I have no complaints about him. He said, \"I'm sorry but there is no grilling on the hotel property.\" Then I proceeded to explain to him that I had been told or lead to believe that grilling was allowed by 3 different persons. 1st, the person who told me that grills were already there. 2nd by the girl who told me grilling was done by the pool. and 3rd by the guy who told me there were no grills. All 3 of them had the opportunity to tell me that \"There is no grilling on the property\" and none of them did. In fact, the first 2 told me it would be allowed. He said, \"Oh, okay, well I'll have the manager come out and speak to you then. Just tell him what you told me and he'll make that decision.\" -- Again, he was very nice about it. Before the manager came out, a security guard, an old Spanish guy in his $60 came out with a serious little look on his face... Had a very \"Scarface\" type demeanor and said, \"You gotta put that out... You can't have that grill out here...\" --- And the smug little attitude he had wasn't inviting or courteous... we were literally being treated like criminals. He wouldn't even make eye contact with us... He said something into his walky talky and people were staring at us... And as I was explaining him that I was waiting on the manager... he kept telling me I had to put it out until the maintenance guy showed up and reconfirmed that I was waiting on the manager... After some hesitation he finally stepped off to the side and eventually left for a little bit... After about 10 minutes, the hotel manager came out and talked with me and I explained my situation. I told him that I wouldn't have honestly 1) spent my money on the grill and supplies (over $30 total including coal, lighter fluid, the grill, and utensils) had I not been told that grills were on the site before I booked and that my entire stay was based around that lie. However, I informed him that the coals were dying down and I was on my last bit of meat and I'd be done momentarily... He then told me I could leave the property and grill my meat on the side of the street in front of the hotel... While I understood his position, that was a bit insulting. After having stressed how much of an inconvenience this ordeal was, he eventually asked me how much more time I would need. I said, \"About an hour...\" collectively he and the security guard who had joined him said, \"Ohhh no no no.... an hour?? That's too long... this needs to be put out soon... No we can't do an hour.... Then he looked at the security guard and told him to give me 15 minutes...\" I was cooking exotic meats... the meats would have been ruined if I had to stop cooking them, wet down the grill... take the grill to another location... and try to relight it... It would have been a waste of time, money, and meat. Luckily, The guard gave me 30 minutes and I was done by the time he got back, however, I had more meat that I needed to grill. I asked to be compensated in some way and the manager\" Chris Richardson said flat out that he wasn't going to compensate me. I wasn't asking for a free night but considering the fact that I had to go out and buy a grill and spend $30 on supplies that I'd never fully utilize, I felt I was owed some type of compensation and he refused... The moral of the story is, the hotel got my money on false pretenses and were unwilling to make their wrong right. I will absolutely never choose this hotel again. I would have paid double what I paid to stay elsewhere.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "MsPainn", "ReviewID": "UR114590437", "Content": "This place was horrible.

By the time we got back from dinner we were exhausted, we layed down to go to bed and my daughter said she felt like she was getting bitten again, we pulled up the sheets and low and behold, it was infested with bed bugs, my husband picked up a few of them and went to the front desk and told them what was going on and showed them the bugs and they said, I Quote \"we are not Bed Bug Experts\" and asked if we wanted a different room and my Husband told them no we dont want to go thru this again we would just like our money back so that we could leave.. While my husband was up at the front desk I proceeded to pack up our stuff and sure enough the bugs were in our suitcases and all over our clothes, thats how bad it was. I decided to look at my daughters legs and arms and sure enough she had bites all over her. Well to make this story short they would not refund my money they told me I had to fight Book-it.com for my refund. I know for a fact that once you check out of a hotel that was boked thru another web sight they automatically get there money. Needless to say, we wound up drving home to Cape Coral at 1130 at night and stripping our clothes off as we were driving because the bugs were on our Clothes. So Yess I want to thank you Seralago Hotel for not only ruining my vacation but also my Mothers Day that I spent washing and treating my Family Clothes, Bombing my card to kill them and also having to wash and treat my dogs for the infestation I would never reccomed this hotel to anyone, just for the fact of the nonshalontley of it all it was just no big deal to the manager, like I was suppose to suck it up and and bear it", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFamily Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kaydine", "ReviewID": "UR106826457", "Content": "Serelago is a nice family orientated hotel. staff are friendly and helpful.

I was nervous b/c the reviews here are mixed. I'll try to comment on the good as well as the bad so others can make an educated choice re: this hotel. The hotel was easy to find and the location was convenient - close enough to do Disney stuff w/o the 24/7 Disney influence and the Disney prices. We had a rental car so we could zip over to Disney within 10 - 15 minutes. I wouldn't want to stay here w/o a car though as their Disney shuttle doesn't run very often and we wanted to be able to easily get to restaurants, grocery stores, etc. When I booked this hotel I called and asked if it's possible to get a kid's suite facing the pool and the lady on the phone said that all the kid's suites are poolside. I booked over the phone and said that we for sure wanted the pool side. I wanted the poolside room b/c I knew there would be times where our infant daughter might be sleeping, or the other kids might be sleeping in the room and DH and I would like to sit outside the room and read, have a coffee, etc. w/o waking the kids. When I checked in though I was told that they could see that it said poolside on my reservation but they didn't have any poolside kid's suites left. I explained that I was told they were all poolside and the girls said that was a mistake. I didn't make a big issue of it. The girl at the check in wasn't very apologetic for the mistake and although she was basically friendly, she didn't do anything extra to be welcoming or hospitable. We drove to our room and I was surprised that this is actually a motel, not a hotel. Basically it's a two story row of rooms where you park out front - no hallways. At first this bothered me b/c it seemed very highway truck stop motel like, but it actually ended up being convenient b/c we could easily get things to/from the room and could grab things from the car quickly w/o any effort. The room itself was quite dated and quite basic. When I first saw the kid's suite I was very disappointed. It was a small wooden divider that was about 6ft tall, just sort of set up in the room. The kids loved their little \"cabin\" and were thrilled with their own bunk beds and tv. The room was clean and I didn't see any bugs, mold, etc. as other mentioned. The bathroom was fairly basic and I was surprised that the Kitchenette area was a counter in the bathroom shared w/ the bathroom sink. There was a microwave above the counter and a fridge under it. Our toilet kept running all the time unless you jiggled the handle to get it to stop. We figured this out after finding the running water toilet noise annoying. The crib provided by the hotel was one of those metal cribs that many hotels use. It was quite old and didn't really fit together all that well but it sufficed. After being in the room for about 20 minutes I was kind of feeling disappointed with our accomodations. In particular I was frustrated that there weren't any chairs outside the room to sit on and I was really hoping to switch to a poolside room. I called the front desk and asked if they had any 2 room suites by the pool explaining that I was lead to believe we'd be poolside when I made the reservation. I was told we could upgrade for $20/night. I asked if the manager would be willing to wave the fee given their mistake in booking and was told that we'd be getting a lot more space so they couldn't wave the fee. I then mentioned that they had the room sitting empty and really they'd still only have one suite to clean so really it wouldn't cost them anything for us to switch and they'd have a much happier customer and the guy on the phone said something like, \"I don't think we could do that\". I then asked if they had any poolside kid's suites available for the next 2 nights and he said they did and we could move the next day in the middle of the day. I then learned that they don't have any chairs outside the poolside rooms anyways so it would be a hassle to move and not much benefit. So after all that I thanked him and said we might as well just stay with what we had and save everyone the effort of moving. We stayed 3 nights in total and it worked out just fine. The beds were comfortable, the room was serviced well each day and we slept well. We spent very little time in the room so it was basically just a place to sleep at night. We were awakened a couple of times by people arriving later at night (car doors closing, people talking, etc.) but it wasn't too bad. Every night around 11ish the sprinklers outside our room turned on for 10 minutes and were quite loud but we fell back asleep easily. The pool area was really nice and the pool was a nice temperature. The pool bar/restaurant looked nice although we never used it. The baby pool could use some fresh paint to make it look a little more appealing - it's sort of yellow stained looking. My kids had a fun swimming and hanging out on the pool deck. I used the laundry facilities which were handy and convenient. We only tried the restaurant on the first day for breakfast and we found the selection to be limited and the quality to be low so we ate elsewhere for all our other meals. I tried to buy Disney tickets at the hotel but they charge a $5 convenience fee per ticket and their tickets are the same price as buying at Disney so I decided to just buy straight from Disney. They offered to sell me discounted tickets if I went to see their timeshares which I declined. Overall this was an okay place to stay if you have kids, have your own vehicle and are looking to save some money. They could improve their hotel greatly by freshening up the decor and by recruiting staff that care about the guests and make the guests feel more welcome.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place and Great Service\u201d", "Author": "stevieb71", "ReviewID": "UR103827148", "Content": "After reading some scathing reviews by quite obviously small minded people I felt obliged to redress the balance. I booked the Sera Lago Resort through a British Airways Package. The criteria I used in chosing the motel was price, location and facilities. After reading some extremely mixed reviews before we flew out there was a slight concern that maybe it had been the wrong choice. I have to say that I as well as my family were delighted with the facilities, the room, the beds, the cleanliness of the place and the service we received during our stay there. The only thing that I could critisise was the heated pool was cold, but that could be easily explained due to the record cold temperatures that Florida was experiencing during our stay there, and was in no way the fault of the hotel. Our 15 night holiday started off with a disaster, our initial flight delayed so we were transferred to a later one this was also delayed so we missed our connection in London this meant we had to stay overnight in a hotel there. the next morning 1\" of snow fell so they closed the airport. We finally took off 3 days later but couldn't get to Orlando as the flights were full so went via Tampa which meant rearranging car hire at the last minute. On the flight over my 6 year old son developed food poisoning, vomiting and soiling himself several times on the flight over. Not the best start to the holiday I'm sure you'll agree. We arrived at the Sera Lago deeply relieved at what we found. The weather as I have stated was around freezing for several days when we were there and although this impacted on our enjoyment of some of the parks it was reassuring to know that we had a nice warm and welcoming room to go back to. Yes the decor is a bit dated and could maybe do with a wee update but to be honest it is no worse than the vast majority or American motels. They are all styled very similarly and although some are now revamping their rooms the vast majority are the same as they were. As for the people who moan that they didn't get something for nothing get a life! You are in Orlando to have fun and see Mickey Mouse not sit in a motel room moaning.

We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in the Kid Suite. It was fun for our 3 kids in their own \"room\" with bunk beds. The king bed we slept on was very uncomfortable (too firm) and the sheets kept coming off. (I think they were too small for the bed.) The bathroom was very small and you had to \"shuffle\" around the large door to get inside. The \"kitchenette\" area was a nice small with a decent size countertop, however it doubled as the vanity/sink area. We had a few maintenance issues: one lamp would not work, another lamp did not have a bulb in it, and we complained about the sheets coming off. Management was more than accommodating in fixing these issues for us. They gave us a free buffet breakfast at the Vineyard Cafe for our troubles. The lobby was nice, with a little convenience store and arcade. There was a time share desk, which I mistook for concierge, and when I tried to ask a question about the hotel, they went into their spiel. I was annoyed by this, and just walked away. The hotel provides a free shuttle to the Disney Parks and we used this to get to Magic Kingdom. The pool area is huge and very fun, with music and a little Tiki Bar that has fabulous Pina Colodas. The area was quite busy and crowded with families until late, but it didn't disturb us. It's nice to see so many folks having a good time with their little ones. We ate at the Vineyard Cafe twice, and the food is ok, not gourmet, but not too bad either. It has typical buffet foods, but you can also order ala carte from the menu if you wish. With 3 little ones, the buffet is just easier for us. Before we left, we used the laundry facilities. They were clean and nice, but very expensive. Bring change because there is no change machine there. We had to purchase something from the convenience store in order to get quarters. Overall, I would say this is an ok hotel. I would stay here again with my children, but if it were just my husband and I, I would stay elsewhere. It is clean, the food is ok, the pool area is nice, but the bed was not comfortable.

Nice common areas. Dirty rooms.\u201d", "Author": "abcdebeatty", "ReviewID": "UR91576034", "Content": "When we arrived I found that the hotel was in a perfect location for our purposes. Real close to Old Town and near enough restaurants that we could do some walking. Also located close to I-4 or side roads for easy access to the theme parks. (within 10-15 minutes in light to medium traffic) Appearance of common area: Outside is nicely landscaped and building looked well-kept. Only 1 entrance in/out (good for security). Lobby was clean and open. Pool/Hot Tub was very nice, clean and handy pool towels. All rooms had exterior entrances on 2 floors only. All very near the pool area. Staff: Half very helpful & friendly and the other not the best. Excellent security staff. Room: We stayed in a room on the back side of the first building on the first floor. At first the room looked like rooms in most economy priced hotels. It included two full sized beds (not queen), table top TV, a tiny mircowave, and a very small fridge. Both located in the bathroom wash area located outside the toilet/shower room. There was 1 cabinet to put food. There was also a table and 2 chairs, but NO OUTLETS near enough to plug in a computer or other device. Cleanliness of room: The carpet was very disgusting. If you weren't wearing socks you could feel the grime on the bottom of your feet. If you wore socks, they got very dirty (we always wore our shoes). They vacuumed daily, but doesn't look as if they were ever cleaned. The bathroom was clean and mildew free, but no fan for venting. Comfort: Full sized beds were small (bigger would have crowded the room). The mattresses felt well-worn and the pillows were flat. Chairs were covered in a plastic-type material (that I'm almost sure were never wiped down), and uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time. Housekeeping: We were the first room from the service room, so the first to get the door knocked on to be cleaned (finally found magnetic privacy note three days in). We received daily towels, beds made, counters wiped down, trash dumped and a vacuuming. Pretty normal. There was a day or two where we received no service. I was surprised that the cleaning staff left a tip envelope for doing what I was paying the hotel for. Misc: Room near service area. The staff was not so quiet outside our room at 7am. They also had golf carts and wheeled carts pushed by our rooms earlier than that. Made it hard to get that last hour or so of much needed rest. Food court is overpriced. Breakfast buffet was ample (fruit, bagels, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, potatoes, sausage). Game room had some good games, but the \"prizes\" were a complete waste. Driving down 192 east of here, I'm not sure if you can find a much better hotel. Most looked similar outside, don't know what was inside. This was definitely a second class area compared to the overpriced hotels on I Drive. I don't know where the happy medium is?? I paid half the price of normal rates in a great on-line deal. There is NO WAY I would ever stay here at regular rates (avg. $80/$90 night). The condition of the most important parts of the room were too disgusting or uncomfortable (and I don't even have that high of standards).

I'm not going to sit here and say this place is the Ritz, but it certainly isn't a roach motel. There are good things and bad things about the place but at the end I feel as though it was worth every penny. When I first arrived I went straight to the room because some of my family had already arrived ealier and check in. As soon as you pull around back you may stay getting a weary feeling because the place doesn't look like a resort. It's more like if a roadside hotel, and condo development from the 80's butted heads, but overall the grounds were well kept, and plenty of staff and security were on duty. Now I work in a hotel as a manager so my family can get a little restless with all the criticizing I do when we travel, but heres the good and the bad: Once I had got settled in we needed to go down to finish checking in the other two rooms our family would have as well. When we got to the front desk there was only about 5 people in front of us but it took almost 30 minutes to finally get to the desk. In their defence it was a very busy weekend. Once we finally got an issue with the reservations figured out (families fault not theirs) we decided to go back and get ready to plan the rest of the night before we went to Disney the next day. The rooms were a very good size and overall the cleanliness was pretty good. No hairs in the bathroom ( a pet peave of mine), no grime or gunk in random places, and clean sheets. The only issue with the room itself was that it could use a fresh coat of paint and to have the carpets cleaned. Really though, it wasn't that bad considering the traffic that goes through that place, probably running an 80-90% occupancy most of the year. Another thing that bothered me is that they have a Tiki Bar by the pool that closed at 5pm, and then you had to go inside the main building to the bar. Not that big of a hassle but when you have a nice bar right there by the pool, it doesn't make much sence to close it down right when people would like to wined down and relax by the pool, especially since the weather was so beautiful. Hoping it was just a seasonal thing. Great staff. Every person I encountered was very friendly and seemed to enjoy working there which is a great thing to see. There are two very large pools and both well kept so even though it was busy, it wasn't crowded at all. As I said in the title, the location can't get much better for the price. Literally maybe a 10 minute drive to the park and the majority of that time is spent actually driving into the park. In the main building is the bar, a shop, and even an arcade which was fun to enjoy with the kids to pass some time that night. People now a days need to understand that places go through normal wear and tear, and things break even if there is a ton of prevenitive maintenance. I myself found this place to be quite nice for the age of the building, and other than some carpet/furniture cleaning and painting, it's pretty well kept. If you go to Disney and are only paying 50-80 a night, you shouldn't be a person that expects the world. Compared to the hotels I've worked/stayed at, this place does a wonderful job for the rates they charge. If you want fluffed pillows, a sauna, and gold coming out of your faucets, this isn't the place for you. If you want a place to relax, have a soda and a pizza before and after a long day/weekend at the parks then this is the place for you.

We have stayed there twice previously. The hotel is very close to the Disney parks, and is a Disney themed hotel (though not an official Disney resort). The hotel itself pops up first on many of the travel sites because of its location and price, which are its main features. The Seralago is located just off Osceola Pkwy and just a few minutes from the attractions. There is adequate parking, a swimming pool, complementary breakfast, and a once-a-day shuttle to the parks. Most of the rooms have a microwave oven and a refridgerator. A coffee service was missing, however. Per night price was under $50, which is perfect for value-oriented customers. Also note that there are no elevators so guests who require them will be placed on the first floor. Unfortunately, after a couple bad experiences I won't be staying at the Seralago any more. We stayed there earlier this year. Our room key didn't work. This in itself is no big deal as equipment does break. The problem was the response of the staff. We waited almost an hour while they contacted security, had security determine that \"Yes, the lock is bad,\" then another 15 minutes while they fixed the lock. They didn't even offer another room. They didn't even apologize. Not even a single \"I'm sorry this happened.\" On this last visit checkin and key worked fine. It was late so we went to sleep quite early. The next morning I noticed the filthiness of the bathroom. There was large areas of black mildew around the base of the toilet bowl. There was even hair caught up in it. As I didn't notice it previously I didn't expect the hotel staff to offer a discount on my next stay or something like that. But I did expect that they'd at least fill out a complaint form or make it appear that they were concerned about the room quality.

It is not a 3 stars either, that's the biggest lie out there. I believe the star rating should be given not only for the amount of amenities offered, but also for the quality of the service and rooms. This is an old motel and the quality of the rooms/services leaves much to be desired. You also need to use your car to go to the reception or the restaurant, since this motel is huge, like one of those big housing projects, and distances, depending on the location of your building, can be long. This was may experience: The first night we had to wait for more than 20 minutes in line to chek in (it's a cheap hotel so it was busy and there were only two employees). The first room they gave us smelled like cigarrettes and since we don't smoke we went back to change it. The second room smelled like something was burning in the bathroom so I went back again to get a new one. The third one they gave me is what they call a \"suite\". This one has a bunk bed and a king size bed. The king bed had several dead bugs on the bed's sheets, and the air conditioner made such a horrible noise that we had to turn it off; but we were so tired by then that we decided not to go back to the reception. The following day they moved us to a new room (thank God!) and this time the room was clean and smelled clean, as it should be. The problem arouse the next morning, when at exactly 7:00 o'clock in the morning a Chlorine Truck (one of those used to clean swimming pools) started to make a strong noise that lasted for more than 40 minutes. When I called the reception to complain about the noise so early in the morning, someone called Kevin told me that the truck came to make a delivery and there was nothing they could do to stop the noise. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant only once. It was OK, but beware of the cheap price, it was $7.00 per person, but when you add the beverages it can become expensive. The orange juice, for instance, cost $2.99 and it tastes like synthetic car oil. We found a cheaper and better quality breakfast in a restaurant across from the hotel. I would not recommend this motel to my enemies, but if you are on a tight budget and don't care about sleeping in run down rooms and old, bad quality mattresses, this might be for you. My only recommendation to the companies offering this hotel is to change the star rating: this is 1 or 2 star, not a three star.

This time we opted for a non smoking room. Man, what a difference! The furniture was nicer, the beds were super comfortable, over all it was just better. As usual, it was clean, the service was great. The cable was out on saturday morning, but I don't go on vacation to watch TV. My only complaint is about their shuttle to Universal. While it's great that they've added the new service, I was sorry I opted to take it. The seralago probably has very little control over the shuttle once it leaves the property. It picked us up at 8:45 right on time. The driver was a miserable woman who argued with the disabled elderly woman who was going to Seaworld. Tacky. It seemed like it might have been her first day driving a bus, because she almost hit a few cars. When we finally arrived at Universal AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER, I had had it. How does it take an hour and a half to get from the Seralago to Universal?? I have made the drive many times and I know it only takes 20 minutes tops with traffic. I asked her where we meet the shuttle home, (being my first time taking it) and the driver looked at me like I was crazy for asking her such a ridiculous question and yelled, RIGHT HERE!

If that's what you're looking for, you'll need to pass on the Seralago. But, for someone like me, traveling with three young children and on a budget, it doesn't get any better. I was able to get a room with a king bed for myself, and a separate \"sleeping area\" for my kids at a VERY affordable price, and the kids loved it. The pool area was HUGE, and very well-kept. I sat under a nice covered awning at the outdoor bar and enjoyed a couple of cocktails in the shade right next to the pool while my kids swam for hours. We had dinner in the great market/food court, and it was very affordable and actually pretty tasty for a snack bar. The breakfast buffet was much more than I expected, and two of my kids ate free, which was an added bonus. The kids also enjoyed the arcade, although some of the games were out of order and the others were a bit pricey compared to other hotel arcades we've been to. The location was fantastic, although we were not there for Disney this time, and getting in and out of the hotel was a breeze. The kids loved having their own space and TV, and having the microwave/fridge in the room was a nice extra as well. As far as comfort, the rooms were typical of an older motel, a bit dated, but clean. The king bed was a bit worn and \"springy\", but served it's purpose. We were fortunate to get a first floor room, right by the pool, which was great, but we were also close to the lobby, so the foot traffice by the room was a little noisy. And, while the kids enjoyed it, the pool being open until midnight was a bit much from a noise standpoint. My only complaints were that there was no DVD player in the KidSuite, which most other similar types of accommodations have, and the selection of X-Box games at the front desk were limited. The television lineup was limited (no Cartoon Network?), but again, I'm sure many don't come to Orlando to watch TV, so not a big deal. And, as typical of most resort hotels, there was a hotel \"concierge\" in the lobby that actually was a timeshare salesman, so getting information meant having to dodge a persistent badgering of trying to get me and my kids to take a tour at one of their properties. A question of directions was answered by a single-word answer, followed by a sales pitch that I repeatedly said NO to. Didn't like that at all. Again, if you're in town to experience the whole \"Disney\" thing and are looking for total pampering, this isn't the place for you. But if you are looking for somewhere that's clean, affordable, and has enough amenities to keep the kids happy, then give this place a try.

We drove by the Seralago and it looked ok in the outside, old but well maintained, non pretentious and all the cars are people seen looked like normal budget travelers, not some of the \"crowds\" we had seen at other hotels we had driven by. We had a coupon and got a discounted room within minutes. The check in staff was efficient and for $35 a night I was shocked that they offered to help with our luggage. The room was basic but decent. Some people would have been horrified at the stain in the carpet but having braced myself for the worst I wasn't bothered by it. The staff was very friendly across the board, everybody said hi as you walked by. The beds were comfortable and the AC worked very well with no smell of mold like at many other area hotels. The hotel is very big and we got a room that didn't have neighbors on either side so we didn't have any noise issues at all. The pool looked nice although I didn't use it. The food court was basic but did offer very good prices and I liked being able to pay the same price I would pay at 7eleven for snacks at their convenience store. The breakfast buffet was a good value but the food was typical low price buffet fare, not very good but edible, the selection was limited but there was enough variety to fill up on. I still would recommend going to Ponderosa or another buffet for breakfast but having it on site proved to be very convenient. Overall I am happy that we lucked out by just driving in and using the discount. It is no luxury hotel but it was a lot more amenities than similar hotels in the area for the same price.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201c2nd Stay, rooms average at best but good value.\u201d", "Author": "GulfSider", "ReviewID": "UR61150322", "Content": "This was our second stay for a Disney weekend.

Check -in and out was friendly, but the people who we called/asked for help with the wi-fi problem were not. The heated pools and hottubs were good and the rooms are average, old furniture but clean, not an issue, lots of families/kids running around although every day we were in the lobby there were people complaining about things/looked unhappy, one group was checking out early, so perhaps there are other issues that we did not come across. The water was sometimes a little bit of an issue, you would go from great hot flow in the shower down to a trickle, literally!

They have a large game room for the kids, an indoor movie theatre, basketball court, tennis court and volleyball. My son totally enjoyed this resort.

Kids 10 and under eat free and for adults $6.99. The rooms were clean. In fact I could smell the bleach and disinfectant when I first entered which was a plus. Now the edge of the carpet was a little worn but that did not matter. The beds were very comfortable. The other great thing about the hotel is the location. It is directly next to the Old town amusement and shopping area so you can walk to it and it is only a 10 minute drive to the Disney parks. The service was great. I really enjoyed it and would definitely stay here again. The other nice thing was on Saturday mroning they had an Easter Egg Hunt for the kids and the Easter Bunny also appeared . It was FABULOUS!!! This hotel definitely caters to kids and families. I paid the AAA rate which was about $61.43 per night and in my view I got more than I expected.

We had rented a vacation home but needed a place to stay for one night until we could get into our home. I booked it on line due to the pictures and the price. When we first pulled in it was somewhere around 10:30pm and it was extremely busy and busteling. I wondered if I would regret getting a vacation home and not staying where there was alot going on. There were 3 people in line in front of us and 2 people working. It took 30 minutes to check in. As we drove around to our room I realized I had indeed NOT made a mistake by renting a home. There were buses of kids everywhere running around. The pools were all full of kids yelliing and carrying on. (It was after 11 pm) When we finally found our room in this compound of buildings we had to lug all our stuff upstairs (no elevators). When I opened the room truly all I could do was laugh. It was pitiful. Keep in mind we did not pay 30.00 bucks a night as even that would have been a rip off but 60.00 a night for the worst room I think I have ever stayed in. The beds came to my knees and I am only 4'11\"! The carpets were gross, I would not even use the microwave. When my husband and I climbed into the bed it just collapsed in the middle....The springs were poking through and the box spring was broken down. There was hair ALL OVER the tub. And to beat it all was a nice little envelope soliciting tips for the housekeepers. THEY GOT A TIP FROM ME ALRIGHT! If it hadn't been so late with a very sleepy 3 year old I would have left and gotten another room. THe website is extremely decieving unless you are fortunate enough to have the room they updated for the pictures for brochures etc. We ended up running the A/C and the Tv all night to drown out the yelling kids and doors slamming everywhere and then hoped and prayed we did not leave with bed bugs or worse from this dump. WIth the location it has the potential to be great however; it appears they can still make their money and not have to update or fix anything as long as they have the big school groups of kids coming. The one bright spot was maintainance. When the blow dryer basically blew up in my hand when I turned it on, I called the front desk and they were there in about 15 minutes or so to replace it. For 60.00 I was not expecting the Hilton but was expecting a room that had been at least updated in the last 30 years. My room had not been! All I wanted was a comfortable bed and a clean room.

My son has Down syndrome and behaves more like a young child and in the arcade there was a game to pick soft plastic balls. He finally won one and was nice and loud. The clerk heard him, did not complain or asked us to quiet him down but instead asked if her wanted a couple of balls that she had behind the counter. The breakfast is not the greatest but great when you want to leave early and no time to go out to eat. There was danish and hot foods including egg, bacon, potatoes, cereal and fruit. Rounds about $ 8 an adult Ie over 10 I think. The back pool was great. Ten pm air temperature about 50 pool temperature about 75. Tennis court / basketball court not in the greatest condition but for us it was perfect. We also played badmitdon and volleyball. They have all the equipment again not the best but playable.

The TV was a bit temperamental but we got the hang of it on the end. The maid came very day though and changed the bedding and towels. However, once you get used to it you do feel secure and it does have everything you need, i.e. fridge, iron/ironing board, plenty of closet space, etc. Just be aware before you go that it is set out like a motel, not a 'traditional' hotel. The front of house is very presentable and the staff were very friendly, the safety deposit box service is great and extremely secure. We had a problem one night with noisy neighbours but called security and they came out straight away. There are two pools, one which had all the families based around it and the other which we were based next to was empty, which was lovely! There was also a jacuzzi and gym and volleyball court but we didn't use any of those. There is a store for your essentials but there is another one about a 5 minute walk away which is much cheaper. There is a games room too. Plus you get free Wi-Fi in your room which was very handy! The best part of staying here was the location. It is right next door to Old Town, FunSpot, and a Pirates Crazy Golf course which meant that we always had plenty to do in the evenings. You must eat at Flippers in Old Town, they have the best pizzas anywhere! Right by the hotel is also a KFC, McDonalds, Ponderosa, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Checkers, and loads more. The best places we ate were Red Lobster (their bread rolls are to die for), Logan's Roadhouse, Flippers, and Bennigans. BE AWARE - the Chinese buffet across the street gave me food poisoning! We were also disappointed with the Ponderosa. The waiters at all of the restaurants were very friendly. We did not eat in the hotel as there was so much locally. Further up the road is a Walmart and a Publix, Publix is much cheaper than Walmart! Also, Publix do a few Disney toys at a much cheaper price than in the parks! The best service at the hotel was the free shuttle bus to Disney, which was great. It left in the morning or at lunchtime and came back at three different times at night. Very easy to use and free! It takes you to the Ticket & Tansportation Centre, from which you can get the monorail to Magic Kingdom or Epcot or the bus to any of the other parks. That can be a bit fiddly as for some parks you do need to switch buses but there is a helpdesk at the Centre who will write it all down for you. You have to pay for the shuttle bus to Universal, Seaworld, etc. but compared to getting a cab it's much cheaper and the drivers are very accommodating if you want to change your return time, etc. Our driver was caklled Tim and he was great. You do have to book the night before though, and there are pay phones in the hotel lobby if you don't want calls charged to your room. The drivers will also take you to the airport for a much cheaper price than a taxi if you ask them (we got a normal taxi to the Seralgo from the airport which cost $70 and the one we booked with Maingate on the way back was only $50). For the Disney bus we tended to give the driver a dollar each trip, although you don't have to, and for the bus to universal we gave $5 for the round tirp. The paid shuttle also goes to Orlando Premium Outlets, which is a must if you like your bargains! We got Levis for \u00a315 and Ralph Lauren tops for \u00a310!!! If you are planning on gong to Busch Gardens from the Seralago, the shuttle bus will pick you up from Old Town which was incredibly convenient. You do need to book this though, and I think it was every day except Saturday. All in all, the Seralago is a great base to do Disney a lot cheaper.

When I checked in they had me down for a non-smoking room despite when I reserved I wanted smoking. Between the time I reserved and the time I got there (a month) they had somehow changed all but 6 of the 615 rooms to non-smoking. Maybe they thought I would quit in between and not notice. Anyway at check-in I requested and received a smoking room. I asked about wi-fi service and the lady told me they were having some problems that I should try it to see if my room worked. After settling in I tried it, found out it did not. Went to the back pool are, no luck; went to the front pool area no luck, went to the lobby no luck. Went back to my room still no luck.

Carpets need major cleaning, mine had several stains on it. Beds are awful, if you run your hand across the top of the mattress you can feel exactly where each spring is...my head seemed lower than my feet there was so much sag in it. I remember previous years seeing mattresses delivered all the time. I'm not sure which infuriated me more, the mattresses or the noise. As if trying to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress isn't bad enough, some of my neighbors every night I was there weren't there to sleep. There were several rooms both to the east and the west of me in which there were many college aged people staying. I could tell when I seen them taking their garbage baskets to the ice machines to fill up. And then they would be running back and forth between each others rooms...until 4:00 AM. I know that for a fact, because that's how long it took me to get to sleep. I that someone must have complained because I seen the security drive by in his golf cart and stop, look at the building and then drive away. Must have been too much effort to get off that nice cushy seat. Yes, you better believe I'm on a tirade. There is a LOT of competition for business in this area. Some are dumps but there are also many better ones for similar prices.

Since I am traveling with just my sister, I decided to hunt for a decent hotel with good facilities. Seralago Kissimmee is located about 10-15 minutes drive from the Disney MagicKingdom parking lot. So location wise, THUMBS-UP! Free parking is provided as well for the residents of the hotel. If you choose not to pay the expensive parking rate to park in disney, the hotel actually provided shuttle services to the main transportation center. However, there are only 3 shuttles in the morning and 3 at night. Thus, planning is a must. I got a great deal, $59 bucks per day and I got a $75 bucks discount for staying more than 5 days. So it is a real bargain. Room is decent and clean. Not as spacious as you imagine but come on, less than 40 bucks a night after discount, I would not complain. All basic amenities are in working condition. No major problems in the room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend looking to save a little bit on accommodation.

We are an average, budget conscious family - not looking for luxury hotel, but don't want a dump either. Just someplace comfortable, safe and convenient. The Seralago fit the bill on all. We booked an INCREDIBLE rate of approx $35 per night directly through the hotel's website and using the AAA discount. Breakfast was an additional $13 a night for husband and I and the kids ate free - so basically, the $13 fed 4 ppl. First, the rooms. Please understand that they are outside entrance - basically motel style. We were on the outside part of the building, meaning, not facing the inner courtyard where the pool is (poolview rooms are slightly more $$). I found it great b/c we parked our car right outside our room and walked right in. Some ppl like this, some don't - whatever floats your boat. There was not much noise throughout the evening with other guests going in and out - never bothered me at all. The A/C worked fine. I turned it up full blast when we first entered the room and w/in a little while, the temp was cool and comfortable. The beds are not luxury, but they are comfortable, and we all slept fine each night. No, they don't have fitted sheets, as previous reviewers have noted, but they have flat sheets tucked in. With an adult and one child on each bed (two double beds in the room) we did not have the problem of ending up on a bare mattress - it was just fine. The room size was standard and fine for us - two double beds, a chair, dresser, television, desk w/two chairs, open closet, dressing/vanity/kitchenette area (sink, mirror, small fridge, and microwave - no coffee maker), enclosed bathroom w/toilet and tub with a showerhead. Oh yeah, my only complaint - in order to fully close the bathroom door, we had to lift up both the toilet lid and toilet seat so that the door could pass and then close. Kind of a pain, but whatever, it's minor. Had no problems with water pressure. Bathrooms were clean upon arrival and cleaned (along w/the room) every day. I did ask for extra towels, and was given them no problem. I used the small refrigerator - just had some water bottles and soda cans in there - and it worked fine - well, that was after I adjusted the temp - I put it on colder when we arrived and then it was fine. It seems they lower that and the a/c, but that's understandable to save on electricity. There was no coffee maker, but I don't drink coffee anyway. :-) Breakfast was ok. If you get the breakfast w/your reservation, you are given vouchers upon check-in and you present that to your server. Server will bring drinks and take any egg orders if u ask - like if u want fried eggs instead of the regular scrambled that they have in the buffet - they don't take orders for special omelets or egg whites, etc. The buffet was pastries, eggs, bacon, bread/biscuits, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and two cereals - standard fare to fill you up, nothing fancy - so, we did just that, filled up to start our day and we were on our way. DO leave a tip for your server! They were all very very nice & very accommodating. Speaking of nice staff, ALL staff that we encountered were very friendly and helpful. We drove down to FL and arrived in the early afternoon, so I called ahead to see if there'd be any possibility of an early check-in. I spoke to Gabriella at the Front Desk who told me that it would not be a problem. Great! We got there an hour later and were promptly in our room - no delays. We spent time at the pool which was wonderful. There was a separate, gated-in, kiddie pool area for the little ones. There were plenty of chairs, some tables, a hot tub, and towels were provided. The bar/snack area was open for a bit, and we got pina coladas which were not that great. :-( Pool was clean, not too crowded, warm, just perfect. Inside, by the front lobby, there is a cafe/snack/convenience store area - u can go in there and buy snacks, burgers, pizza, sunscreen, soft drinks, coffee, juices, etc, at any time - you can even charge purchases to your room. They even have autograph books to take to Disney in case u forgot urs. :-) Disney is only a few minutes away down the road and Universal Studios and Sea World are just a bit longer away down the I-4 - no more than 15 mins or so. There are TONS of place to eat up and down the road where the hotel is. Nearby is a Super Target (make a right out of the hotel entrance and follow the road for a few miles). Hotel is easy to find, very convenient. All in all, as I said, we had a wonderful stay at the Seralago, and I would most definitely stay there again. This is not a place for those used to luxury hotels and/or the discriminating traveler. If you're a down to earth, regular, family traveler, then this is a great place to leave your stuff, rest, sleep and hang out at for a bit before u make ur way to other attractions for the day.

Although there was a catch - the catch was that we wouldn't know which hotel we would get until AFTER we booked. So, for $28.00 per night, we thought it was worth a \"test.\" Besides, Hotwire claims that this hotel was in the same category as a Holdiay Inn at a 2 1/2 star rating. We decided that if it was a bad idea, we'd just go somewhere else and call it a learning experience. Well, it ended up being just that--a VERY bad idea and an interesting learning experience! We had never heard of this Seralago, and after booking through Hotwire, doing research once we got the hotel name, I started to get nervous. First, when we arrived, the lobby was so dated and dirty. Of course there were TONS of exciting eye-catching things for kids in the lobby, so we went ahead and checked in since our girl was excited about the arcade. We were offered to \"upgrade\" because the Hotwire rooms are all the way in the back in the area they have a hard time renting out. So, we paid $5.00 more per night to \"upgrade\" to a room by the pool. We were given the keys to our room on the second floor and drug our luggage up the stairs as there is NO elevator. When we opened the door, the musty, damp air hit us in the face. Being upbeat and optimistic, I tried to \"freshen\" up the room by cranking up the a/c and spraying air freshener in the air. We started inspecting the room. I suppose you get what you pay for. The room was not what I would call clean by any means. Hair, soap scum, old grout stained brownish-black from years of dirt, carpet stains and ancient bed-linens...this was NOT in the same category as a Holiday Inn! (Hotwire, please do better research!) So, we realized that there was a high pitched sound coming from the pool pump. It was SO loud that when we called the front desk to get moved, they could hear it on the phone. They offered to move us to another room on the other end of the pool. (This was, by the way, in the first building-right behind the lobby.) When we got the keys another room, we took our luggage in and started inspecting the room. After about two minutes of looking around, my daughter asks, \"Mommy, what kind of bug is this on the headboard?\" I ABOUT FELL ON THE FLOOR! IT WAS A BEDBUG! NOT ONE BUG, NOT TWO BUGS, BUT THREE BEDBUGS WERE FOUND MOVING SLOWLY ON THE HEADBOARD!! We called the front desk and DEMANDED a refund. (Which, we had to go through Hotwire and they did make it right for us. I appreciate all that Hotwire did to correct this mishap.) In any event, I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone! Please take this review into consideration from an honest, over-protective, germaphobic mother and try find another hotel-even if it does cost more!

The area has lots of shopping and restuarants nearby including 24 hour stores within walking distance.. The shuttle drops off at the WDW ticket & transportation center which is actually faster than stopping at each park. WDW transportation is available to each park from TTC. If you want to leave the parks at a different time than shuttle service, public transit, running every half hour, can be taken from the TTC which drops you off in front of the hotel. The bus takes basically the same amount of time as the shuttle with seating available. Across the street from the hotel is a bus stop for public transit to WDW TTC running every half hour. As well, public transit can be taken from WDW TTC to Seaworld. It took us around 15 minutes. However, taking public transit to Universal studios is a hassle and time consuming as you have to transfer twice with 15 minute waits between each bus. The food in the food court was excellent with large portions and reasonably priced. I just wished it had stayed open later. Midnight would have been nice. A complementary shuttle to Universal Studios is the only other amenity that I would add. If we ever go to Florida again, I would stay here again without considering any others.

It is located in a perfect section of Kissimmee which is close to everything. SeaWorld, Wet N Wild, Disney and Universal are all just a few minutes away! It is also right next to Old Town which is pretty cool but sort of overcrowded. For the price I think it does VERY well. We stayed in a regular room which gives you two king beds, a sink area and a bathroom. There is a fitness area and free high-speed internet. Housekeeping is good at keeping up with the place, the service at the counter has been perfect since day one, there is a guest service counter inside which can book a timeshare tour for you which gets discounted or free Disney tickets. We did not do this but it's a deal if you have the time. There is also a snack area inside which sells food like a small convenience store. Breakfast is in the mornings until 11AM, I think they said it was $13 for adults but we just went to iHop down the street. There is a food court next to the convenience store inside. It has it's own private bar which is a huge plus, good prices on drinks for after the kids fall asleep. There are two pool areas, one with a hot tub, kiddie pool, and bar. Very cool set up. It's also nice because the pool areas are open until midnight! We always felt safe here because security is always hauling around the building in case there are any problems and to ward off any. I don't really have any problems but I do have a few nitpicks. The bathrooms were painted cheaply by spraying the ceiling and it looks kind of crummy. This could just be because I'm a painter by profession and that's a big no-no in my book. There were some small ant looking bugs on our night table one night, may have been bedbugs, but none of us were ever bitten, there were none in the beds when we checked. Another problem is that people kept taking our parking spot in front of our room and we had to park across the small lot. I think they should number their parking spots to avoid this annoyance. I'm sure anywhere would have small issues like these, but this is all I have as far as bad. This hotel has been great! There are so many pros to staying here- location, amenities, staff.

Music playing just loud enough that you can hear it while laying in the sun but not so loud that it interferes with conversation. One set of rooms had the volleyball court and the other had a Jacuzzi/hot tub. Towels were available at the poolside every day so you didn't have to worry about your own having to dry before leaving the area. The breakfast buffet was awesome. We ate there every morning to a different variety of foods and fruits. From cantaloupe and honeydew to watermelon and french toast sticks to pancakes, hot cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, gravy and biscuits, hash brown. Juice, milk and coffee with a smile from Sami and Myreta (spelling? sorry!) as servers! Everyone was wonderful and catered to our needs in a genuine way. The dining area had a TV for kids and handed out coloring pages each day so the children had something to do as the parents finished their meals. Then they posted them on the walls. Quiet at night but one of the most kid friendly places we have ever stayed at! the lobby had a restaurant, bar, convenience store with foods and pizza, drinks and ice cream, etc. There is a ticket counter for discounted tickets to theme parks and an arcade for the children. No lifeguard on staff meant that the parents were with their children which allows for control on the children. Beach balls, mattresses, tubes and diving toys were all allowed in the pool which made the children that much happier to be in the pool. The water went from 3 ft to 9 ft in the deep end. Something for everyone with an outdoor poolside bar that serves snacks and drinks for all ages. I can't say enough about this hotel! When we come back to Florida we will definitely stay at the Seralago. Close enough to the fun but far enough away to enjoy the lesser traffic.

Every time I called the desk for something they were very fast to respond. All things I called about were easy fixes. Thought the light bulbs had burned out but come to find out, the cord that they were plugged into wasn't plugged into the wall well enough. The only concern that I had about this hotel is that the bath mat in the room was like an air cushion once the water started to fill it. I almost fell a couple of times because it isn't stable under your feet. It is set very high like an overlay tub was put in when they remodeled or something. It sort of left a musty smelling odor but it wasn't enough to smell in the room. Just in the bath when the door was closed.

Only requirements we had were - a clean place to hang for a bit before heading over to Disney and a decent price. Overall the Seralago met those requirements. We didn't arrive until after midnight so the lobby was basically empty. Check in was quick and efficient. We had a Kid Suite room. Smaller than I expected, but it served its purpose. The room is designed for 5 people - why only 4 bath towels?! We added breakfast for 2 adults for $13.00/day - 2 kids ate free, so we only had to pay for our teenager. The breakfast was only $7 or $8 so we only saved a buck with their add-on! The food was average. Slightly above what one would find at most motel \"free\" breakfasts. A couple of hot selections - nothing to brag about. No breakfast potatoes - just a big 'ol pile of tater tots!? The first day our waitress said we could order fried eggs w/ toast from the kitchen - which we did. The second morning our server didn't even mention it. We spent our only full day there away from the resort as we went to the beach. We left early and noticed the housekeeping cart nearby. We got back around 3:30PM to find our room had not been serviced. We called and were told someone would be there in a few minutes. So off to the pool we went. Nice pool - it was clean, pool bar nearby. Not too bad. Back to the room at 4:30 - still not clean. We call again and that's when the service issues kick in. The phone agent was nasty - accused us of leaving the do not disturb sign up all day - nope! Then she said they routinely service rooms until 5PM and we weren't missed. Interesting - as we noticed most rooms that had their blinds open had been serviced and there were no signs of housekeeping activity?! Asked to speak to a manager and you would have thought we were asking to speak to the President of the US!! She wouldn't give us a manager for anything!! Another call back and we were placed into the manager's voicemail. We had dinner reservations so we had to get going, too. We used the wet towels from the AM (all 4 of them) and got moving. I went off to go to the front desk and when I opened the door the manager was right there. He offered nothing - no explanation, just rambled on about how he wasn't familiar with housekeeping processes, but would have it corrected. It was then that the people staying below us arrived back at their room to find it also wasn't done. Okay - this review is going on way too long - bottom line is that the housekeeper forgot to do our room and the one below us for some reason (last rooms on the row). In the grand scheme of things should be no big deal, but the way we were treated trying to resolve the whole thing was really unacceptable. The staff was very rude. When we returned from dinner the room was finally done and lots of towels were left! Again - not a bad place for a quick stay. I wouldn't want to be cooped up there for an extended stay though. They also need to take a close look at their customer service attitudes as well.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cAverage-Ok place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Polkadotsmile", "ReviewID": "UR33695707", "Content": "We stayed here as it was rated 3 stars and the overall look of pictures from the hotel looked good. After booking Hotwire reduced it stars to 2, so I was a little worried. When we arrived it looked great from the outside and was close to Disney so I was a little relieved. The service inside was anything but fast and friendly, but I took that with a grain of salt. We were given a room in the back building, it seemed with not too man other guests. It was quite some distance from the rest of the hotel. We booked on Hotwire, so we thought oh well maybe this is where they put those that get the discounted rate. We walked up a flight of stairs (No elevators) to our room. The room was big and spacious. There was a refridgerator and table with chairs. The linens and furniture were old, but clean. The room smelled musty, but not smokey. So this being said- We stayed the night. It did the trick and we were off to our actual desitination the next day. Overall- if you plan to stay here-don't expect a new hotel. The rooms need a little remodeling and a little TLC. The appearance is fun as per the website, but a little disturbing after you stay there. My 16 year old son said it looked like an adult hotel with cheap frills to make it look kid friendly, like strangers with candy. We won't be staying there again. That being said I did have a friend who was in a worse hotel nearby, who called me to see what I thought about this hotel as she needed to change from the other. I told her what I thought and she stayed the night and was much happier than where she had stayed.

The location is great and is only a few miles away from the Disney main gate. We only use the room for sleeping and showering since we spend the majority of our time at the amusement park, so obviously we don't need a fancy schmancy place to stay. It's relatively quiet at night, and we've never felt unsafe staying here. They offer a free shuttle to the parks, although we have never used it, since it's only about a five minute drive away and we prefer to come and go on our own schedule. The staff is always friendly and prompt and the price is great. With their awesome military discount, we have never paid more than $40 a night. Their restaurants are okay, nothing spectacular and a tad overpriced for the quality. I'd save my money and go to one of the many restaurants that are within walking distance. I've never been to the bar because it's usually closed by the time we come back from Disney. We've stayed here on about six separate occasions and have only gotten one really awful room (shower was broken, sheets were dirty, door hinge was falling off), and with one phone call to the manager, we were immediately moved to a much better room AND given a free night's stay. There's a tiny game room, inside the lobby with a few crane games, pinball machine, basketball game, etc. It's a good place to keep the kids entertained for a while. Although I have yet to swim in the pools, they've always looked nice and pristine. My only major complaint about the hotel is the lack of wi-fi in the rooms, but they do have wi-fi in the hotel lobby. Hopefully they'll get with the times and equip the rooms with internet access soon. I highly recommend the Seralago to anyone traveling on a budget.

I spoke to a third person who was given a room of one night but then would have to move to the room they reserved on the next night. Seems that they give the rooms to the folks who pay full rate for the rooms vs anyone that has a discount. I asked why they didn\u2019t tell me up front. All I got was a blank stare from the staff behind the counter. I guess they just figure that you will take any room they give you and you should be happy. The manger was of no help. At first they said there was nothing they could do, and then offered me 50% off. Finally, they did offer me a room at $25 per night and a hand full of arcade game tokens but it ruined a nice weekend for the family. If you get a discount rate be aware that you will probably not get the room you reserved! The rooms are tired and beds are full size beds and only 2 pillows per bed. Rooms only had enough towels for 2 people and requests for more towels went unanswered. We had to take pool towels back to the room. Towels were very rough and thin.. Pool was crowded. Even though they say no smoking its not enforced and due to the bar at the pool and everyone smoking around the pool it was difficult to enjoy the pool area. If you are a smoker it would be fine. Room fixtures worked fine and seemed to be clean. We did not eat in the restaurant on site. Arcade room had one pin ball machine, 4 prize machines, air hockey and car driving and motorcycle driving video games and a couple of others. Most games took 2 tokens which was about 50 cents.

The bathroom mirror was faded, faucets with a little rust on them, a lamp in the room had a loose screw on the knob, the bedroom door was stuck and we had to push hard to open it. There was a small fridge and microwave, iron and ironing board, a small shampoo bottle and bar of soap. The fridge kept our beverages very cold and we did not use the microwave. The hotel had 2 large pools, playground, tennis court, basketball court, volleyball court jaccuzzis and kid's pool. The fitness center had only three exercise machines. The pool area was nice and clean, but the paint on the bottom of it was peeling. They were plenty of clean towels. Breakfast was ok. They offered, fresh fruit (orange and grapes) some sweet rolls, pancakes, eggs, oatmeal, bacon and sausage, orange juice, coffee, V8. Not very tasty but good enough to start the day. The service and location were awesome. Everyone was very polite altough our room was outdated it was kept very clean.

Before that we stayed at least a couple times per year. What's VERY appealing regarding this hotel is it's double bedrooms and it's KidSuites. I did hours of searching for anything like this and almost nothing comes up. You may find a few other hotels that offer double bedrooms but you'll pay a lot of money for them. The Kidsuites are perfect for those that want a room within a room and not pay a lot of money. We pay (including tax) for a Kidsuite around $60. This INCLUDES their all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet and drinks for FREE. This is a Florida resident special (the free breakfast). Book online through their website to get any of their specials. They have at least 12 different themed Kidsuites. And each one has at least a set of bunkbeds with a desk, it's own TV and a game console (call the hotel to find out what type of game console it is to bring your own games). Many of the KidSuites have a set of bunkbeds and another twin bed inside the little room. The bigger room has a queen sized bed, it's own TV, a table, two chairs another little room with the fridge, microwave and then another room (bathroom). For the double bedroom, you pay about $20 more. But we think the Kidsuite has everything we need. The resort has all the amenities you need. A really fun game/arcade room (which we haven't really utilized), two large pools, one with a separate children's pool, both have a separate whirlpool area. There are two bars on-site. One inside next to their restaurant. The other is a pool-side bar (not swim-up). We've never taken advantage of either of these since we really only use the resort to sleep - the rest of the time we are at Disney. They have a fairly large children's playground (all enclosed). The resort, also, has a cafeteria/grocery store if you don't want to eat in the restaurant. There are even tables inside this area if you want to pick something up and eat. The resort, also, offers shuttle service to the attractions. But since we drive up and park at Disney we don't take advantage of this. The location of this resort is perfect. It's literally right outside of the Disney MainGate about a mile away. Which was important because most people won't stay off Disney property because they don't want to have to deal with the hassle of driving far to a resort. But this place is more convenient than waiting for an overcrowded Disney bus to pick us up. Of course you don't ge the Magic Hours priviledge like you would if you stayed on Disney site. I mentioned the buffet earlier but it's one of the big reasons we stay at this location. My husband loves it. It's a hot breakfast buffet with a variety of goodies. What's great is that the restaurant really caters to families. It has TV's all over the restaurant and plays Nick Jr. or Disney at all times. It even has a separate dining area with picnic tables that the children can sit at and eat while coloring or playing games. In other words the children are entertained while you can enjoy an adult conversation over breakfast. I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic getaway. This is all about families and children! The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the cleanliness is wanting. The rooms need work in terms of painting. Sometimes items aren't working properly (coffee pot, refrigerator not working, bad TV reception, plumbing leaks, etc.). It's outdated except for the fresh coats of paint they put on it. The TV's are really old, too. But again we choose it for the inexpensive price, free buffet and the room option of a Kidsuite.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull UK", "Title": "\u201cWelcome Back to Orlando\u201d", "Author": "Uncle-Axl", "ReviewID": "UR20005150", "Content": "Last year I decided to treat myself and head back to Orlando.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, but if you're only looking for a place to sleep, then you might like it. My friends and I stayed there from July 3-6. There were 11 of us in three rooms. Right of the bat we had our first issue. When we went to check in (only three of us went to the frontdesk to avoid having a large crowd) we were told that they had two rooms with double beds and one room with a king bed. We had actually reserved two rooms with king beds and one room with a double bed. We informed the lady of the error, and she insisted she was correct and we were not. Since we are not the kind of persons to make a scene, I gave her copies of our confirmations. We were then told that they did not have the rooms together (due to THEIR error), and offered no apologies. Regardless, we took the rooms. Now, on to the rooms. While they are quite big and comfortable, they \"looked\" dirty. They were actually clean, but gave the appearance of being dirty. The bedspread in my room had two holes in it, and the sofa sleeper did not have any pillows (none were left in the closet). I called housekeeping to request pillows, and they were brought up immediately, which was great. The rooms also have a mini refrigerator and a microwave, next to the bathroom sink. The toilet took a long time to fill up with water, and the bathroom is very small. The air conditioner worked great when cooling the room.

Only 20 basic cable channels and a VCR...but we were more concerned with DIsney than hanging out at our hotel. Our furniture was by no means the type pictured on the web site, but that was no big deal as the room looked clean. The maid came in while we were gone to Disney and did a great job cleaning our room. When we stayed at a Disney resort (Saratoga Springs), their policy is they don't clean every day, so this was nice. The breakfast buffet has pancakes, eggs, bacon/sausage, fresh fruit, biscuits, etc. Florida residents eat FREE, so let them know if you are from FL. If not from FL, 2 kids eat free with 2 paying adults. Now, the a/c we kept running leaked on the inside and wet the carpet so watch this and do not put a suitcase there in case. The thing that I did not like is that our fridge was not plugged in when we got there. I plugged it in and it still did not work well (not that cool), so I called front desk at 10 pm. She said she'd send someone and never did. She asked \"Is it even plugged in?\" which leads me to believe that they unplug them a lot which is bad since it takes a while to get the freezer/fridge cold. WHen we left we still had the same fridge/freezer that was only as cold as our room temp. Front desk never did much to help with that. The snack bar has everything any Circle K, etc. would and the grill is low priced-burger and fries-$4.

From the pictures, the Seralago looked nice and was very reasonable as far as price goes. It even featured a shuttle service. We thought we had gotten a great deal...that is until we arrived. The hotel was described to us by our taxi driver from the airport as \"having its best days in the 60's\" and he was right. The hotel looks outdated by a few decades. The rooms were neat and clean, but modern, they were not. They had bare minimum for a hotel room. Beds, TV, and Shower. The TV got about 7 channels that was in English. There was no wireless internet except in the lobby. The beds were awful. After spending all day at Disney it would have been nice to come to our room and fall into bed, but these beds have NO PADDING whatsoever. They are only box springs. But I would like to compliment the staff. They were nice and helpful. The cleaning ladies did a really good job and I accidentally left my computer and money on the bed and they moved it to make it up then put it all back neatly. I thought that was the best part of the experience. Do not be tricked by the \"shuttle service\". Yes, a shuttle runs to Disney...three times in the morning, then back to the hotel at night at 8,9, 10:10, and 10:45 it runs again. It's not continuous, it only runs at those times. And the worst part is that there are several other hotels all over the area it also runs. The hotel is in very close proximity to Disney, but taking the shuttle turns it into atleast an hour's trip. Some days it took us nearly two hours just to get to Disney. Getting home was the same way. Overall it was a good experience...but we weren't in our hotel that much...just to sleep and have a place to keep our stuff. If you're planning to stay here but not go do something everyday...there isn't much in the way of fun. There's some pools...and a playground that's under construction. Courteous staff, close to Disney, in walking distance of some fast food places, close to Old Town which is like a carnival/novelty place(as an aside, they have oyster shells that have pearls you can open up and make into jewelry).

Ist off we had to lug all of our luggage up to the 2nd floor via stairs. We had a room facing old town and in the very back of the hotel. I think maybe this must be the bad part of the hotel because I wish we would have had the good experience of the other reviewers:) After arriving in our room I started unpacking and getting the kids to get their pjs on etc. We had to get up early for disney- Our kids are 9,7 and 6. As we started unloading everything and checking out the room here is what we found: 1. sink had water in it and a hair-facial or some other type-yuck! 2. an orange was left in the frig from someone else. 3. several hairs in the bathtub 4. room smelled very musty- mildew smell 5. vent in bathroom didn't work. 6. paint chipping around in the bathroom. 7. the jack on the phome was broken so I had to push it in because it was missing the part that keeps it plugged into the phone. My husband was not happy with me- I was the one who checked the hotel out and booked it online. We would have changed rooms at that point but we had already opened all the suitcasses and put the kids to bed by the time we found all of the issues I stated. I know we din't pay for a grand hotel but I was expecting CLEAN. I called down to the front desk and they sent someone to give us some cleaner to clean up the room. It was late by now-11pm and it was a guy they sent with a towel-- no cleaner- he rubbed the sink out with the towel and couldn't speak much english so we just wanted to get to bed and let him leave. I used the soap to try and clean it. We got back the next night from Disney at 10pm and let the kids swim till the pool closed -midnight. The pool was nice. They seemed to keep the grounds clean so i was so disappointed that our room was like a fleabag hotel- Worse than any I have ever stayed at. i will say the housekeeping person at least came in and cleaned our room while we were goneto disney. It still couldn't take away the mold smell. Our son is allergic to mold so he woke up sneezing each morning. We left that next AM for a Holiday inn express in Clearwater- that hotel was like night and day compared to this one. My husband left his leather belt in the room (at Seralago) hanging on the ironing board. we stopped back at the hotel on our way though after a 2 day stay in Clearwater and he was told by the fromt desk that it was not found. He has left things at other hotels before on business and they have always found the item and sent it in the mail to us. That housekeeping person that did such a lousy job got a nice leather belt. My husband is going to be calling and talking to the manager- he was so mad about the whole hotel experience that he left without asking for a manager. I didn't write this review to bash the hotel- though it may seem that way. I wish we would have checked the room out before we unpacke all our stuff. I know they have to have nicer rooms at that hotel or they would go out of business. If you plan on staying here- PLEASE go to your room and see it before you take out your stuff.

The ladder to the top bunk was difficult for my 7 yr old to climb (there is no slant) although he has a bunkbed at home.

Our rooms were OK we did have a few problems, the bathroom door did not shut as the top part was off the hinge and I sat in a chair and it was broken When I called to complain about this it was immediately fixed. Also we were unable to make outside calls, when I asked about this I was told I needed to give my credit card , which I did at check in and she told me it was not needed as I booked with West Jet Vacations and my room had been paid for. It would of been nice if they told me this upon check in in case I wanted to make outside calls. We also were not able to receive outside calls as it went straight to voice mail I called to get this fixed and it was done immediately although I do not think it was . We also would of liked fitted sheets on the mattress as every morning my kids woke up and they were on the mattress. The staff here are fantastic they are there at a moments notice when I complained about any thing and it was fixed right away. We got a fantastic price for air and hotel with West Jet Vacations and this hotel is in the best location it is near flea markets, stores, shops restaurants and Old Town.

This is how we got on. We arrived on 13th May from Dublin to Atlanta, Atlanta to Orlando. Fantastic flights with Delta both times. We were met by our rep (Silvia) acting on behalf of American Holidays coming through arrivals, great stuff, easy peasy. However 1st negative point was at the transportation desk \u201cMears\u201d based on the ground floor. We had to booked our return journey from the airport to Kissimmee & vice versa however our itinerary had only one detachable sheet though it did state in bold txt letters \u201ca round trip McCoy airport to Seralago Kissimmee - Kissimmee to airport. The lady (Rosanna Montalvo) would not honour this & there was no getting through to her, it was lousy on her behalf. In the end we needed to fork out another $40 ?. Another point while at this desk when I joined the queue there was only 2 people ahead of me who were both annoyed at how slow she was working, by the time I got served there were 12, by the time I left 20. I personally find that this \u201cMears\u201d setup is bad,\u2026. What a way to welcome you to the USA !! On arrival home to Ireland I rang my travel agent who was only two nice and will refund any amounts pay extra, once my receipts are posted. Top Tip : Keep all receipts - you\u2019ll never know. Finally got settled went outside for the \u201cMears\u201d bus (9 seater plus 1 in the front) gentle man asked how many I replied 2 adults 2 kids age 3 & 11mths, fine give me your bags & hop on board, I got to the side entrance & I was amazed at what I seen - there were no seats left everyone was sitting in all seats, including some of the 12 that were behind me in the 1st queue at the \u201cMears\u201d desk. I looked at my wife & said this cannot be happening, in the end another bus came within 4 mins, we were on our way - journey time to Kissimmee 40 - 45 mins. Arrived at Seralago, very impressed with what I seen on arrival, even though a lot of reviewers on Trip advisor and spoken negatively about this resort. The receptionist (Vianka) was excellent at check-in, very straight forward, no issues, we even changed our room type to a kids suite facing the pool & hot-tub, paid in full, great. Time is took to check-in 10 mins. We were even told to check our room once entered if we were not happy things would be fixed to our satisfactory. Things were great though. Hotel has a good set-up, with all staff been very pleasant & friendly, though sometimes a tad too friendly - (must be for the tips). There is internet access x2, ATM access, games room for kids etc, guest relations which sell all park tickets and not forgetting Orange County. There is also a food store combining a restaurant which sell fast food, there is a bar inside towards the back of reception & finally a store that sells all the nicky-nacky stuff like magnets, mugs, ash trays, Florida tee-shirts etc. The pool in area A (where our room was ) is a good size with the deep end been 9ft +. Room was great, but just probably a tad on the small side, though bear in mind we had 3 suitcases & 2 buggies or Strollers !!. The kitchen sink was shared with the bathroom, with a small prep area in the kitchen, fridge included. The AC is so cool, tip leave it on when you leave you room for the day. Note that there is no safe in the rooms, though you can store your valuables in the safes at the back of reception. This didn\u2019t agree with us. The restaurant had 2 breakfast setups for the month of May (A) Bountiful Breakfast Buffet (Fri - Sun) & (B) Ala Carte Breakfast (Mon - Thurs), both 7am - 11am. The maids do a great service and deserve a good tip, we had Monica, great coming home to a made fresh bed. Thanks Monica, you were a star. Courtesy shuttle service operated by MCO express Free of charge (tip the driver when arriving at the magic kingdom if you are visiting for Disney world) Bus departs 4 times every morning from 07:40am to 12:10pm outside hotel and returns 3 times a night from 8pm to 22:45pm. Bus departs from bus lane 116 outside main entrance of magic kingdom. All details can be found in the reception of hotel. Normal Kissimmee service buses will bring you to magic kingdom outside seralago opposite side of road, single journey is $1.75, kids are free. Return service again outside entrance of magic kingdom look for route number 56 on the pole beside the blue benches. Transportation to the shopping malls take the Maingate transportation & not the yellow cabs, the meters will rip you off. Maingate are like buses but hold 10 people and baggage, but seats can be adjusted to fit more people. We got a great guy called Tim, couldn\u2019t of been more nicer or friendly, tells you everything you ask about, and trust me he\u2019s worth listening to. You got to book in advance for a journey hope you\u2019ll get Tim, he\u2019ll give you his card with his own mobile contact on it. Maingate Office contact is 407-390-0000. (if you get Tim tell him the guys from Ireland say hello) Fee\u2019s to the mall return are $10 per person, kids under 3 go free. Fee\u2019s with Maingate to Universal studios & Island of adventure are $14 return, again kids as above. Pickup at hotel, pickup at universal is route number 50, lookout on the pavements for sign. Hotels in Kissimmee only do courtesy service free of charge for guests to Magic kingdom, hotels in international drive do courtesy service free of charge to universal studios & islands of adventure. They are both in competition with each other. When we return we will do 1 week in Kissimmee with free courtesy service, and the other in international drive with free courtesy service. Inside Magic kingdom car park shuttle services all parks epcot, Hollywood studios & animal kingdom, though the monoline train also services Epcot as well. Places to eat in Kissimmee in the old town check out the Red Lobster (beside the arcade bungee jump area), they serve great steaks & Lobster in which was my 1st time tasting, wasn\u2019t bad. Also you\u2019ll have your fast food outlets KFC, McDonald\u2019s, Burger King & Pizza Hut. Check out ponderosa they do buffet\u2019s which are great. Take a bus ask to be dropped off or nears abouts at \u201cLonghorn\u201d steakhouse, nice friendly place to eat & drink. Another shopping area to go and see it Wal-Mart\u2019s - what a store, you\u2019d spend all day in this place. It has everything. So apart from the airport issue on arrival, our \u201cdream holiday\u201d was fantastic. The theme parks are great we even got to see Man Utd whip Chelsea in the Champions league final in a ESPN bar. This place is just not for small kids, it\u2019s for big kids as well. If you going to visit the theme parks remember a few things before you do, 1, Review the parks on the TV in your bedroom there are at least 2 stations & the info is amazing before you visit. 2, when a thunder storm arrives & you happen to be in the park, run for cover because this will be a storm which can last for 20 mins, buy a poncho $7. 3, don\u2019t buy phone cards in the theme parks - there are a waste of money and don\u2019t work. 4, do fast pass or single rider for all rides as it\u2019s much quicker. This was an honest description of our adventure of Florida from Seralago Hotel & suites to the theme parks to all kinds of transportation, from the negatives from the start, it\u2019s not enough to keep us away. Would we stay in Seralago again, of course we would, it had 1 or 2 hiccups but not enough to keep us away. Role on Florida again, when my youngest reaches 4 & my eldest reaches 7. It certainly was \u201cthe year of a million dreams\u201d !! Please feel free to email any questions you may have.

Make sure you book a \"poolside\" room though, especially if you have kids. I found the staff friendly, however I didn't appreciate \"guest services\" being a front for \"timeshare\". They tried to nail us immediately, saying there was a special offfer for those checking in on this date. We're not from here and didn't know how prevelant the timeshare crap is but luckily, a very nice front desk clerk clued us in. The room was clean enough and the location is great, offering alot of dining, shopping and other entertainment close by. The free shuttle to Disneyworld was convenient too (signs are posted on the bus for gratuities). I found the restaurant okay but I think there are better deals close by. It would be worth eating there if you had 2 or more kids under 12. They offer snacks like fries and burgers and pizza at a reasonable price. Now the negative. If you have any kind of back problems don't stay here. The beds are old and hard. We don't have back problems but we still found the beds quite uncomfortable. Another minus are the greedy maids. How and when I tip is up to me. I made a point of asking a maid who would be cleaning our room and she said so and so cleaned on Saturday (the day we arrived, so obviously it was for someone else) and then another girl for one day and then the regular cleaner for our room for the next three. I sought out the girl that cleaned for the one day and decided to wait until check out day for the the other one and leave it all at once. I was rather disgusted to find a \"note\" the day before that was a thinly vieled request for money. I really didn't appreciate this and think that maids have no business leaving notes to guests. We rent these rooms and they are our \"home\" while we're there and I found this an invasion of privacy and did not appreciate the gist of what she was doing. My mother experienced the same thing here a year prior. I wonder if the management is aware of this? A gentleman took our e-mail address and said we'd be recieving a survey regarding the hotel and I thought I would take that opportunity however we have thus not received anything.

The Ugly: Breakfast at the Vineyard restaurant came with the room (free with the Florida Resident Special). Others pay $18 per couple in advance or $25 per couple at the door, according to the website. It was truly unedible. I don't understand how a breakfast buffet on Sunday morning could be so bad. Cold, dry eggs, lumpy grits, cold sausage patties. The only edible item was the store packaged pecan spins. The waiter offered cooked to order eggs, so I ordered scrambled with cheese.

Having gone through bad experience for first night of stay in Orlando, we requested a tour of available rooms in each category. And they very willingly agreed to it. Though property shows signs of age, rooms were clean and neat from inside. At $56/night 2 double bed room, it was a deal. We had couple of issues, but professional approach of staff makes us feel go again to the hotel (3rd time. First time we had stayed in hotel which was under different name. We realized that after we checked in). Issues were: - Water force was not quite sufficient in the morning on one of the day. But as soon as I complained, maintenance staff was knocking on the door to check the problem. Quite a quick response. - It was our first time at Cafe for morning buffet breakfast. Though we knew that kids eat free with adults, did not know that every cup of milk, juice and coffee was extra. Waiter also did not inform us when we ordered it. So it was surpise when check was presented. I raised the concern to cashier but went ahead and paid for full amount. To our greatest surpise, the cashier lady credited the card for beverages and called us at room to apologize that the waiter was new.

Very spacious and well lighting parking. Security patrol in the hotel makes me feel save. I make my reservation directly in the web page: www.seralagohotel.com and this was the best option for us. When you make the reservation in the web page you can obtain a breakfast offer. For just $18.00, including gratuity, two adults enjoy a fabulous buffet breakfast, including coffee, a $25.00 value. You save over $7/day! Our buffet includes eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and more. A great way to start the day and save! And the kids 12 and under eat free!! And the best of all: you can select a La Carte Breakfast or eat in the buffet. We use both options and are greats.... If you go to Ponderosa you pay about 3.99 each one in your party + coffee + juice + tax + gratuity, so if you are 4 you will pay about $25.00 or more. But in this offer you pay $18.00 for 2 adults and your kids 12 and under are free... We love it this hotel. The front desk staff was very friendly. I dont speak english very well but this was not a problem because the girl in the front desk was very smiley and freindly with me. She try to understand me and she was very helpfull with my reservation check in process. Other friendly girl was a lady name Scayra is an strange name but this girls was very friendly with us and thank God she speak spanish. The hotel has a small candy store that alsp serve pizza and other great snack. Also has a game room for the kids. We never use the shuttle service because we have our own rent car. MY ONLY TIPS FOR YOU IS: STAY AWAY FOR THE TIME SHARE COUNTER. THEY ARE VERY AGRESSIVE FOR THE TIME SHARE OFFER. BUT IF YOU JUST SAY !!NO THANKS!! THIS IS ENOUGH FOR THEY.

I was happy to find a micro fridge and a microwave in our room. This made it very nice for a quick and easy breakfast before going to the parks. We stocked the fridge from a close by Super Wal Mart. Driving time to Disney Parks was no longer than 10 minutes. There were no extra charges, such as a resort fee. There were two heated pools that we did not have time to use. We did use the laundry facility ($4 to wash and dry not including detergent $1 for this on site or $3 for a weeks supply at Wal-Mart). There is an onsite bar and restaurant which we also did not use. Our room faced the Old Downtown. There was a band playing one night that we were able to hear, but not too loud that we could not sleep.

They angrily barked at guests telling them to have kids sit and adults stand, then crammed people tightly into the bus. One female bus driver yelled at this Asian tourist woman's face (2 inches away from her face) about her child having to find a seat. Another male bus driver in his microphone was complaining how a woman did not understand which hotel drop-offs the buses were going to.

It was deleted because the Seralago Hotel did a great job in resolving a discrepancy with the price I was charged for the room. I went from completely dissatisfied to satisfied. I am increasingly impressed that, after I left, I was contacted by the GM to resolve the problem. If you are coming to Florida for the whole \u201cDisney trip\u201d experience, then Seralago is the cheapest way to go because you are only really at the hotel to shower and sleep. If you are thinking about booking the breakfast with your room, think about this first: you are getting up early to go to the parks and beat the crowd. Who really is going to have time for breakfast at the hotel?? Why not just grab something small at the parks? Honestly, the buffet is not all that great, but the menu is okay. Just skip booking the breakfast all together and stop at Dunkin Donuts (down the street) and eat along the way to the park. Problem solved. Other than that, the hotel was okay. You get what you pay for, but I think in the end, this hotel is good to stay at if you\u2019re in Florida for the \u201cDisney\u201d experience. OOOOhhhh and if you stay here, you HAVE to eat dinner at \u201cPacinos\u201d which is on the same road as the hotel. It\u2019s a big Italian restaurant, definitely a gem!!! We all ate every bite on our place. So stop there for dinner, you won\u2019t regret it. Not to mention the VERY fun amusement park right next to the hotel. They have THE best go-carts ever, and a fun mini golf place too. And NO LINES! So, to sum up the whole Seralago Hotel; good and cheap place to stay, fun amusement park next door, and surrounded by great restaurants on your off-days from Disney.

Maintenance came sprayed some lubricant on it, slammed the door a few times and said the door was fixed or so it appeared.

I waited over 30 minutes, maintenance never showed up, and I had to leave, so I had a travel friend wait for them.

The front desk informed me that they could not remove the security lock until the next morning and gave me another room to stay in. I could not even get into my room to get my belongings. The front desk said that was all they could do, told me to have a pleasant night, and gave no apology. Luckily, one of my travel companions was able to open the security lock (questionable hotel safety ) and I was able to retrieve my belongings after midnight.

The carpet was damp also which was strange. For the most part, however it was fairly clean. The maid kept it clean and neat throughout our 4 night stay. The hotel itself was more family friendly for those of you with small children. The decor was geared towards children. There was an arcade and a pool and jacuzzi. There is a small food court and a restaraunt that has a breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet had a decent variety and was ok, nothing special, just ok. Fortunately our trip did not have us in our room very much so it worked out ok. We basically just slept there and took an occasional swim. Location wise, it is right next to Old Town, so you can walk and there is shopping and amusement rides, mini golf, etc. It is about 5 minutes from the entrance to Disney and about 15-20 minutes to Universal.

When we checked in it was past midnight so to pass judgment on the grounds would be unfair. However, our room was on the 2nd floor and on the first floor there was a big garbage bin that some raccoons had decided to make their home for the evening. We had to walk around the building to another stairway to get to our room. That was the beginning of the end. We entered the room there wasn't anything special about the room. Just basics. That would have been fine however as soon as I sat on the bed my daughter notice some type of beetle/bug on my bed pillow. I tried to get it and missed it. Who knows where it ended up. I called down to the desk to tell them about the raccoons. I was told that security would be told to move the garbage bin. That never happened. The room was so old and worn down I didn't want the kids to touch the floor in their bare feet. The beds were horrible, it was like sleeping on the floor. I want to know when was the last time mattresses were brought. The bathroom was disgusting. Rusty door, bathtub never looked clean. Hair from previous visitors still in tub. I didn't allow the kids to take showers for the three nights we were there. The next day when we left for the parks I noticed the grounds. The grounds could be nice if they were maintained. There were palms that I know were once beautiful but now their poor roots were exposed and they just looked neglected. In fact the whole place needs renovation. My daughter begged me from night 1 to please find another place for us to stay. I did feel bad for her because she is somewhat of a germaphope and it must have been extra hard for her. Even my niece who ususally is very easy going was disturbed with the facility. The only upside of it was we were hardly ever there.

There were some school groups there when we were there who were noisy in the pool until late at night, but one call to security and things were quickly toned down. One point -- when my Mom booked the place, the website said it was a kids eat free policy in the Vineyard Dining Room for breakfast and dinner. That was true for breakfast, but the Vineyard is no longer open for dinner. We had a group with a total of 9 children, and had budgeted for the kids eat free thing so were a bit concerned about that, but when we showed the website printout to the manager he quickly made it right.

One night we called housekeeping for extra pillows and they never came. The next day when I called they were there in 5 minutes. We had a room next to the front pool and lobby area and it was fine. The bed could have been firmer, but the room was clean and the location convenient. They say that both pools are heated but we found the front pool to be too cold to stay in. The back pool is at least 10 degrees warmer, but the spa was wonderful. We never tried the food court and the pool bar was closed until the day before we left. The staff was friendly but check in was very very slow. Check out took about 2 minutes, so that was nice. The movie theater plays family movies every night or you can rent movies to watch in your room(they are vhs and our vcr didn't work).

There is a well stocked store with reasonable prices and also a take out to purchase pizza and other hot items which are pretty good. The inside bar was also reasonable, but the outside bar by the pool was not open at all when we were there and I found that disappointing.

We stayed in a \"poolside room\", but it was actually on the 2nd floor of the hotel, so we had to drag our luggage up stairs, so if you want main-floor, make sure you ask for it in advance. Two huge heated pools, with DEEP ends (9 ft?) which are pretty empty during the day, and open till midnite! If sunbathing is your thing, it's great. Also, 2 hot tubs & lots of towels at the pool. Check in is VERY slow, although the staff was very friendly, and also kept our luggage locked up for us after checkout so we could enjoy our last day around town. My room keys stopped working on 3 different occasions (showed expired??) so I had to stand in check in line each time to get them reset. We took advantage of the \"kids eat free\" breakfast, (7-11AM) which included buffet OR a la carte--again, nothing fancy, but a good start to the day, but get there before 9:00 or after 10:00 AM or you'll have to wait in line for seating, or you can get cereal, danish & coffee or fruit at the little store off the lobby to avoid the \"dining room\". You have to check out Old Town (next door), and there's a great mini-golf course, and a \"black-lite\" indoor course within walking distance -- great for kids. Overall, the hotel served our purpose, the kids enjoyed it, and anything you may need was available.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shreveport, LA", "Title": "\u201cDepressing and a bit scary!!!\u201d", "Author": "Zan_Kitty", "ReviewID": "UR6566207", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for only 2 nights (we were originally booked for 7 nights). The property did not feel safe and it definitely was not as advertised. The motel's lobby and restaurant has been remodeled recently, and that, along with the convenience store, were nice. However, if you try to purchase tickets to the parks at the lobby, they will try to rope you into visiting a time share. We actually got our tickets for less money at the Epcot Gate than was offered to us for a \"special deal\" at the guest services counter at the Seralago. The room felt damp, there was corrosion from the air conditioning units outside of every room. The room was not adequately cleaned and there were definitely lots of \"undesirables\" roaming around the parking lot at night. Staying near \"Old Town\" is NOT a plus. There ARE lots of restaurants around, but you'll find that with most any Orlando Hotel. There is complimentary parking, but again, we found that with the next hotel we stayed at as well. This motel was actually depressing and took away from the magic that is supposed to surround a trip to the Magic Kingdom. We were also disappointed that kids only eat free if the adult orders the buffet (so if all you want is cereal or fruit, you'll pay for your child's breakfast) and that there was no internet access. The \"free shuttle\" only comes and goes a few times a day (we rented a car). Although the prices of this hotel are very inexpensive, and we were traveling on a budget, it was definitely a relief the leave this hotel and book ourselves into a nicer place. I would not recommend staying here by any means. On another note, if you visit Orlando during peak season, it may be worth it to you to stay at a Disney Hotel.

I have been happier with continental breakfasts in other hotels where you can help yourself to coffee, tea or cocoa without waiting for a server to set it in front of you. The scrambled eggs were tasteless, the bacon soggy, and the fruit came out of a can. There is a booth inside the main lobby where someone will try to offer you a \"deal\" for Disney tickets or shows, and after taking a half-hour of your time explaining how it works, you learn that in order to get the discount, you must attend a several hours session to listen to a time-share promotion! That was so irritating! The service at the front desk was inconsistent amongst the staff. There was a pleasant woman in her 50's who was very helpful and courteous; later in the day, a woman in her 20's who answered you abruptly and curtly.

The receptionist was helpful but not pushy. At first I wasn't sure about the location of our room since it was near the laundry area for the motel. I was worried about noise but the only time it seemed noisy was at shift change at about 7pm. The pools are extremely clean, the hot tub is just the right temperature for sore muscles after days in the parks. Loved that there were lots of towels available and some were even still warm from the dryer. I couldn't hear noises from other rooms but I also don't know if the neighbouring rooms were filled. Our room was very clean and the carpets cleaner than many higher priced hotels I've been in. The bathroom is small with the sink outside the room but good enough for a vacation stay. We had a microwave but it didn't work. We didn't complain since only tried it on a lark, didn't have the need to warm up anything. The fridge was nice and cold, and hopefully someone enjoyed the few beers hubby left that he couldn't finish before we had to leave. Our room was cleaned every day and it even seemed to be vacuumed every few days. (we stayed for 9 nights). We tried the buffet breakfast one morning and it wasn't that great so we didn't go back. We went to Walmart and bought fresh fruit, juice and croissants that we ate each morning in our room. We accidentally locked both key cards in the room, and had no problem getting a third at no cost. (I have been charged for this at other hotels). Air conditioning worked great but I did find it hard to get rid of the humidity in the air so not sure if that is just Florida or a poor working air conditioner.

We have annual passes to Disney and live 1.5 hrs away. When we decide at the last minute that we want to stay at the parks for fireworks etc... we like to stay overnight so we don't have to drive home late at night. For that type of stay, the Seralago is perfect. We have a large family, so it's a little harder to find places to stay that will accomodate all of us and still be affordable. Both times we stayed in a large suite facing the pool. Once on the top floor, once on the bottom. It has a bedroom with 2 double beds and tv, big bathroom, kitchenette (small refrigerator, microwave, sink) and living room with murphy bed and full sized sleeper sofa and of course a tv. We put the kids in the bedroom and sleep on the murphy bed. The mattress on the sofabed leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms have all the basic necessities, soap, shampoo, towels, even paper towels for the kitchen and some plastic cutlery. I definitely would not want to spend more than 2 or 3 nights, but for our impromptu overnights, it has been comfortable and clean both times. There is a free breakfast included but it is only for I think 2 people, so not enough for us. And from a brief glance into the restaurant we decided we'd rather pay a little extra and get something we know we like. There are tons of places right nearby. That's a whole 'nother review because some are good, some not so much. The only negative we have experienced is at night it tends to be a bit noisy. Nothing that keeps us up, just a little bit of a nuisance. I think it is due in part to the fact that Old Town is right next door. (though my kids love having a view of the crazy bungee ride right out the window) Also, the first time we stayed, there must have been some kids running around during the night because in the morning we woke up to some sticky blue substance (paint, I guess?) on our window, in the key card slot and also saw it in the vending machines and on other windows. They also seem to have more security than I've ever seen at a motel, which reassures yet concerns me. We will stay here again in the same circumstances, but when we go for longer stays, we prefer something nicer.

We were originally in a deluxe room but that room was unacceptable (my friend heard lots of folks complaining about their rooms) so we upgraded to a huge two room suite which had a bedroom with two double beds, a living room, small kitchen and a bathroom. The suite could sleep up to 8 people as a murphy bed pulled out from the wall and the sofa also doubled as a bed. The room was very comfortable and we had no maintenance issues. The bedroom had reasonably comfortable beds, a TV, and a VCR plus a phone with a message light that we never did get to stop flashing. The kitchen had a microwave, coffee maker and small refrigerator but no dishes, glasses or utensils. The bathroom had a hair dryer, adequate towels, minimal toiletries (soap, shampoo), plenty of hot water and decent shower pressure. The living room had another TV and VCR in case two parts of the family want to watch different things, a sofabed and a chair. Our upgrade included a breakfast buffet each morning, the first morning it was pretty bad but the next three mornings it was good with lots of hot items including pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon and sausage. And the waitresses were all extraordinarily nice. The hotel had a small snack shop where you could get some food plus a couple of onsite places to eat and two outdoor swimming pools. The negatives: The hotel shuttle only goes to Disney World a few times a day and then only to one park at a time, it stops at other hotels so it took us at least 1 1/4 hours to get to the Magic Kingdom using the shuttle. There was quite a bit of noise at night since all of the rooms were exterior rooms. Kids playing shuffle board at midnight, older teens literally throwing dog feces at each other on another night, someone pounding the metal banisters at 3 am. This is a definite drawback to this kind of hotel where all the rooms are on the exterior of the buildings.

The swimming pool and surround were clean, plenty of sunbeds, the hot tub was hot, and there were loads of pool towels which was great. They even didn't mind if you took their pool towels off to the water parks and then returned them. We didn't use their restaurant as the hotel was within easy walking of plenty of places - there was a 24 hour Dennys if you were late back from the Parks, KFC, McDonalds, IHOP, Sizzler, and Ponderosa doing an all you can eat buffet breakfast for $3.99. Again, not high class stuff, but good enough for the kind of holiday that most of us are on in Orlando. If you needed them, there were also a Publix and Walgreens just up the road.

The building was worn down. We originally chose a poolside deluxe room... No, no.. there's no deluxe in this room. Very small, uncomfortable beds and furniture falling apart. We knew that we wouldn't last 2 days in this room let alone a week. We decided to check and see what else they had upgraded (for $40/night) to a 2-room suite. MUCH better! However, basically at this hotel you get alot of teenagers with school groups and children. I know we were in Orlando but we weren't expecting it. The pool area is loud from open to close and the location is fair. Not too many places open late close to it on Rte 192. Although there is a Target and the local chain resturants around.

While I was waiting on this to happen, I overheard a front desk clerk (whom by the way did happen to be friendly during our last stay and was actually the clerk that relocated us to a different room the last time since our room had some maintenance problems) telling her co-worker that she had \"Never seen us before\". Very classy thing to do while a guest is still standing in front of you--talk about them. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS THERE!

Unfortunately, I will not be staying at this hotel again until it has been updated. Here are some reasons why. The first kidsuite room that my family and I checked into had such a bad musty, mildewy odor that I had to request we be moved. At first, although unpleasant, the smell was not so strong because the air conditioner had been turned on full blast. Before leaving the room to go to Downtown Disney we turned down the air a bit, by the time we came back the smell was horrible. The next morning, I had to request we be moved. The next room was not really any better. Housekeeping needs to keep an eye on things. There was feces on the wall of the bathroom and mold/mildew in the corners of the tub. Nothing a mixture of 1 part Clorox/ 5 part water couldn't fix. (Good thing there was a Wal-Mart nearby.) The rooms, carpets and bed covers really do need to be Febreezed. The malodor is very much present. The beds are not comfortable at all. Old age is causing them to sag and is causing the coils to come through.

I will first say that I got a bad deal because I paid $69 per night and have learned that people are getting this hotel for a lot less. Generally that is a cheap hotel stay, but in the Disney area there are a ton of hotels at this rate or lower. So with that said.... our first room smelled really bad. Although I wouldn't say it seemed dirty or unkept, the bathroom floor was sticky (which I think I later discovered the cause of and I will get to that!) The bathroom itself... at one time there was something sticky stuck to the back of the bathroom door and whatever it was had been peeled off, leaving the sticky stuff still on the door... which also had a lot of black hairs stuck to the door. Kind of gross. On the second day there (after we were all unpacked of course) the toilet overflowed... not just overflowed, but wouldn't STOP overflowing and continued to overflow into the carpeting. I had to crawl through the mess to get to the toilet to turn off the water to get it to stop. I called the front desk who assured me someone would be there right away, and an hour later I had to go up to the front desk and remind them that I had called at which time they said maintenance was very busy with other rooms... (red flag???). They gave me another room, upstairs all the way on the other side of the property, not near the pool (which I was paying for a poolside room). I asked what the chances of upgrading to a suite were and was informed that would cost me an extra $40 per night so I declined. Room number two was better, didn't smell so funky and we could deal with it, however, the refrigerator (which was a deciding factor for me staying here) didn't work very well, there were never \"fitted sheets\" put on the beds at any time. Instead there were flat sheets that were somewhat tucked under the mattress (when they were large enough to tuck under the mattress...) On a good note, the hotel had a decent sized pool and it was heated so my son enjoyed that. The hot tub was nice and hot... however on the one day that it wasn't turned on and I actually had a look at it, I noted that without all those foamy bubbles you could see a lot of dirt and grime floating around in there. Not sure how often it was cleaned. Can't comment on the cafe because every time we thought about going to it, it was closed. It is only open certain hours. The location is great. Old Town is practically right next door, there are plenty of restaurants nearby and shopping, and it was very easy to get to and from the parks.

We checked in on Easter Sunday. It has gone from a fun family atmosphere to an average resort that needs a major face lift. I guess if we had not been there so many times some things would be intolerable. As a Holiday Inn there were activities going on for kids and a certain level of food quality, room quality and cleanliness. As the Seralago, our room had paint peeling, water leaking from the ceiling and a broken toilet. It definately needs updating. The hotel staff was friendlier than I have ever had in the past. The food in the food court was awful. Barely etible. The breakfast buffet was really good and free. The Guest Service Manager, Robert, was rude, unfriendly and did not seem to care if you had a problem or not. No promised return phone calls or any assistance whatsoever. The maid was terrific. She did the best she could with our room. It smelled nice and for the first time in 8 years we had a good room location without having to complain first. They took out the kids theater and put in a very tacky wedding chapel. The outdoor pool bar was never open that I could see. The arcade was ok. My kids loved the pool. It seemed clean. I love the location, right next to Old Town. There is plently to do within walking distance including Pirates Cove mini golf, food places, and Old Town-a great place to go. The area is going down hill it seems and so is the hotel. Year after year it gets a little worse. There was security everywhere. Makes you wonder why they need so much. We may need to try somewhere else next year. As a travel agent I am unsure if I would even recommend this place unless you are just looking for ok accomodations, good price and a good location. I was mainly upset about the rude guest services manager.

There are real advantages to staying on the property but the hotel room was small and after the kids go to bed there isn't much to do but watch the TV quietly or take turns going to Downtown Disney. When we planned our trip we wanted to have the last four nights in a suite where the kids could sleep while we watched TV or read in the living room. We checked the prices on a number of web sites and finally, with the help of Trip Advisor and it's reviews, decided to stay at the Seralago Hotel and Suites, formerly Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites. What we found was a slightly worn around the edges hotel that was maintained pretty well. The rooms were a little worn but very clean and pleasant. Our living room was the size of the whole room at Pop Century. Along with that, the bedroom was bigger again than that and there was a big bathroom. The kitchenette had a small coffeemaker, small refrigerator and microwave. All perfectly adequate for our needs. The best price we could find was $79 a night compared to Pop Century at $62 with our AAA discount. I don't think that they discount the suites there, but at $79 they are a bargain for families.

Last time we stayed there was June 2004, we booked our room with an Entertainment card which I had accidentally left at home. The staff was exceptionally helpful and allowed my parents to send a fax of their card so I could receive the discount. They also let us add on a few more days at the discounted price. . The first thing my son said when we arrived last time was \"This is my favorite hotel , I love this place\". The grounds are nicely landscaped and they have two large pools and a small sandy play area with a wooden jungle gym which my son loves. They also have a very clean laundry room next to the back pool. The rooms have always been very clean but worn. ( I don't replace my carpet as soon as I get a stain on it and I don't expect hotels to either. ) We love the mini- fridge and microwave in the room for breakfast and late night snacks. Two out of three times we had new fluffy pillows on the beds and the other time we received extra pillows within five minutes of the request for more. The location is great. There is a light at the entrance to the hotel and by going straight thru the light we can get to any of the Disney parks in 10-15 minutes. There are also a lot of restaurants, gift shops, and Olde Town nearby. We plan on going to Disney one last time April or June of 2006 and will definately be staying here again.

The best thing I can say is that we didn't waste much time eating breakfast and that it was nice to have a fridge in the room. Don't stay here.

The hotel was so outdated and needs some serious wrok done. While we were down the the hotel changed managment you would think for the better(no way). The cafe was horrible our first day we got lunck down there and there was no food left and it was expensive for what they had to offer. Never again! Please read this and I hope you take me serious and Please DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! It took them 2 days for them to bring us up a crib which was brought to us dirty. It looked like a truck ran them over. I sent that back outside. I had called down to the front desk and ripped the manager's ear off. They then sent up the same guy and we watched him out the window and get this he turned the mattress over and used the same sheets.

We did not have a lot of money so we found this hotel in a great location, very reasonable in price. We arrived early afternoon and were promptly checked in. We were supposed to have a king size bed but the room they gave us did not. Plus, our room was on the 2nd floor (NO elevators) and was out in the boon-docks! I then buzzed the front desk and they sent a mainteance guy to pick us up in the golf cart and move our luggage for us. They moved us to a room right across from the pool, very close to the lobby. The room still only had 2 double beds but at this point I was tired and really didn't care anymore. The hot tub was never really crowded when we got back from the theme parks which was nice to relax after hours of walking. There were kids all over but what do you expect from a family hotel. There are many positives about this hotel: -Heated pool that closed at mid-night (during the winter months) -Acarde for the kids (and adults) with video games and my favorite...air hockey :) -The free shuttle to the parks worked out great as we did not rent a car. The pick up times were reasonable too. The only thing that stunk was bouncing from park to park to pick up the other hotel guests. When your tired, you just want to get back to relax in the room. -The hotel is on a very very busy street. However, there are your choice of restaurants to eat at. Also, there are many activites to do...for adults and children. There is mini golf, a carnival, go-karts, etc. on the main strip the hotel is on. -Each room has a microwave and a fridge so if you have soda, water, snacks it's nice to be able to store them and enjoy without leaving the room. There are a few downfalls which are expected: -The restaurant was always busy in the morning but the wait was never really too bad. -Be prepared that the cholrine in the pool and hot tub is VERY strong. My bathing suit (being a few years old) was literally eaten-thru. On our check out I filled out the comment card and they sent me a free night stay voucher. -Also, the pressure in the shower was not that great but it worked. What do expect when probably over 100+ people were trying to shower? -Hotel rooms look and feel old. But, it's a room that was cleaned daily. You always had fresh towels and a fresh made bed. You can tell the hotel has some age and is in need of renovations but it works to sleep in. If you want rest and relaxation do not come here! However, if your a family trying to make the most out of your Disney vacation this is a great place for a decent price. Your not going to get 5 stars of service but the hotel staff will help with any problems. Treat them the way you want to be treated and they will help you to the best they can. Overall, if I were to go to Florida I would stay here again. The people were polite and the location was great. The cost wasn't really expensive so it was affordable, even for a poorer family.

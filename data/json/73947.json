Conference center looked very nice though I did not attend a conference there. Staff friendly and helpful. Stayed in club room on 7th floor for 3 nights on business. Room lighting was horrible, no lamp by desk (I have great eyesight and am in early 40's). Older hotel so lack of plugs in room. Plug by bed behind bed. Plug by desk underneath it & had to get on floor to plug in computer. Wired or wireless Internet access complimentary in club rooms otherwise $9.95 in room. They do have a Microsoft funded center off lobby with several computers and 2 with printer access. I had to login there so I think you have to pay for Internet there too unless in club room. Decent Internet speed in room but in lobby slower at their computers. The Club floor club was small and evening snacks ok. No free drinks except soda/water. Club not well stocked with water or soda throughout 4 days there. AM breakfast was continental with Starbucks coffee, hard boiled eggs, cereals, oatmeal, pastries, and frut. Bed very comfortable with nice sheets. Pillows way too soft for me. Bathroom clean and fairly well maintained. Towels mostly fluffy. Ate at restaurant in hotel one evening. Not enough servers or they weren't efficient even though not terribly busy. Menu okay. Outdoor eating area nice but again slow service. Room faced pool with slide. Not too noisy unless patio door open. Patios are too narrow for a chair. In general, pool areas looked very nice though didn't use. Noise levels in room were very good-not disturbed in morning or evening but I do carry and use a noise machine. In some hotels, I hear noise beyond the noise machine and then that is bad but not here. I like the eco-savings where if you don't get your room serviced, for each night you can get a $5 voucher for food somewhere or 500 Starwood points each night. Hotel is right off I-17 but would need car as not much in walking distance. It is close to business area. Parking is free in parking garage to side of hotel. Parking garage does not have an elevator into the hotel so need to walk around the side of the building to the front. I felt reasonably safe at night. If you want to see something interesting, head left out of the hotel and about a mile down on right in the middle of a residential section see cows, llamas, goats, and more in front of a house. Animals seem well kept and did have to park on side road and walk to go take pictures up close.

The hotel was fully booked for at least half of our five-day stay, but there was hardly anyone around. Today I was walking down the hall and saw a significant number of rooms still being serviced by housekeeping after 4pm. We stayed on the club level, and the club was also understaffed. There was a nice breakfast available in the lounge, but the only attendent was frantically attempting to keep everything stocked. Also, snacks and drinks were supposed to be available all day in the lounge, but the coffee and tea were taken away after breakfast and were not available even upon request later in the day, the drink refrigerator (with a damaged door seal preventing its contents from staying cool) was often completely empty), although at other times it was stocked with a small selection of bottled water and sodas. The internet cafe in the lobby lounge had two of five computers out of service and the printer appears to have been out of service for some time. The bathrooms, while dated, were adequate, although there were cracks in the caulk around the faucets and tiles - I'm afraid to imagine how much mold may be growing in the walls. The view outside is great, with views of the mountains all around. You can see the swimming pool and hottub and several tennis courts that are available for guest use. One side of the hotel, however, is bordered by the interstate highway, and the view in another direction is filled with a several acre dirt lot. This hotel is not owned by Sheraton or Starwoods. It is owned by the publicly-traded FelCor hotel investment trust and licenses the Sheraton name. This probably explains why the hotel has not profited from Sheraton's recent '6 billon dollar' chain-wide renovation campaign. I don't know how old the building is, but it appears the last major renovation was probably in the mid-1980s.

I bet It must be quite relaxing a little bit later in the year. Pool and garden are so well kept that the ambiance here is very attractive : hotel entrance is just next to the main I17 freeway (downtown just 20 minutes drive), but hotel is set in a lush semitropical environment with palmtrees, orange trees and so on.

The room was very nice, spacious and well and attractively furnished, although the bed was a bit softer than we like. However, I was really put off by the $10.00 a day internet charge. Normally, when a hotel (and this costs somewhat more than say, Holiday Inn), doesn't have free internet in the room, they at least provide it in the lobby. But no, when I signed on in the lobby, they wanted my room number so they could charge $10.00. Even the conference where I was a speaker didn't allow me to sign on. There was nothing about this hotel that was so wonderful, for the price, that made seem worthwhile to me to add another $10.00 a day for internet access -- something I think every hotel should now provide within its room charge, or at least have available in the public spaces. Another negative for me was the book provided in the room with all the hotel amenities, safety instructions, and room service menus. It was virtually unreadable -- over-designed in a script font, with pastel type on a pastel background. There was no need for it to be unattractive, but it certainly needs to be something that those who don't have typical \"young adult\" eyesight can still read! Now for the positives. The desk people were very nice. I was late because of a flat tire, and didn't have time to check in before my presentation. They understood immediately, took our bags to store, and took my seminar materials to the conference room without any long explanations. The hotel was certainly clean and well kept, and as I said, the room was nicely decorated and pleasant.

It gets a two point (poor) rating and not a one point (terrible) rating only because the room was clean and the sheets and pillows were comfy. We stayed at this property on the front end of a trip and we had reservations to stay on the back end too. Given the poor condition of the room on the first visit and lackluster local management response, we canceled our return reservations and stayed elsewhere. We would not stay here again, we would not recommend it to others, and it was poor enough for facility and service that it left us with a bad perspective of the Sheraton brand overall. We said the same in the guest survey we received from Sheraton by email not long after our check out. And we itemized the same issues as we'll share here. The local management response we received when our comments were shared with him may help explain why service process and maintenance here are so poor. Because we received an email from the director of engineering acknowledging the rooms were in bad shape, that corporate needed to provide the funds to update them, and they hoped we'd stay again. Huh? Because the deal here is, aging facilty aside, that it was local maintenance problems that caused our \"ugh\" response. Those items are completely in the control of local management through maintenance staff priority setting and supervision. As were the service problems we encountered through process and training. Overdue corporate commitment to property renovation aside, the lack of ownership tone of management response here may also explain why this property is in obvious decline. It helps to set context for reviews we think, so will share that we are Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) Gold status members due to owning a Starwood (Westin - Sheraton - Aloft - W) timeshare. We stayed at this property using a substantial number of SPG points. Maybe that's the bottom line - in the mode of expecting to get what you paid for, we feel taken to have those points for for a Starwood hotel experience that was what we'd expect at a low end budget motel. Here's why we were so unhappy for the room: Air vents were filthy with accumulated dust and dirt. Paint on celing in bathrooms was stained and bubbled. Small and dark shower had heavy accumulation of lime scale on door and crumbling marble inside. All of the above could have been mitigated with local management paying attention to maintenance. And we had to wonder, if the rooms to which they assign SPG guests, which have designated floor(s) and hypothetically are supposed to be better rooms, are in such poor shape, what are the rooms for all others like? Or did we simply get stuck with a poor room becaus we WERE SPG gold status guests using points? Regardless, it was clear that the front desk staff could have avoided the assignment of this room if they had the correct processes in place and training to do it as the hotel was not nearly full on that day. In addition, at checkin we were pitched an upgrade $15 fee if we were willing to pay it. Which seems shameful bait to us given the SPG policy is for SPG members to receive free upgrades on check in when upgrades are available. We realize the staff doesn't set the conflicting policies, but this is part of the landscape that makes us increasingly unlikely to use SPG properties when we travel. Last, on the evening of our arrival, after we returned from dinner I went to the desk to ask if I could get an extra coffee packet for our room Informed there were none at the the desk did, I was told someone would bring one up.

My company held a two and a half day seminar at this property for approximately 250 attendees. This seminar was the first of this size that I\u2019ve coordinated solely on my own. I\u2019m thrilled to report that I did not feel \u201calone\u201d on my journey. From the time I met their Sales Manager to tour the facility 8 months prior to the seminar through the time I finished paying invoices post meeting, the hotel staff was more than I could have asked for. Our seminar truly could not have been as successful as it was without the partnership from the staff at the Sheraton Crescent. As one would expect and hope for, the property is maintained well. We did not run into any cleanliness issues throughout the hotel, in the meeting space, or in the rooms. This is a given so I won\u2019t go too into detail here. It is most important for me to speak to the professionalism of the staff. From the associates running the meeting to the actual attendees, I continually heard comments about how nice the staff was. For me, this is an understatement. I could not believe the level of kindness, sense of urgency, and patience the hotel staff has. My experience with the entire hotel staff \u2013 from the General Manager all the way to the room service staff \u2013 was wonderful! Each person we encountered during the meeting showed a much higher level of customer service than I\u2019ve seen at other properties. Our meeting was, at times, a bit chaotic with rotating breakout sessions and 250 attendees moving throughout the meeting space. The Sheraton Crescent staff partnered with us to make sure the transitions were smooth and timely. The attendees never felt the chaos, which is the best we can ask for! The meeting space worked well for our seminar. The rooms are spread out enough to avoid too much bottle necking during transitions but close enough together to make the transitions smooth and keep our breakout sessions on time. As a meeting coordinator having a walkie-talkie to reach any department I needed was INVALUABLE! If I wasn\u2019t able to reach the exact person I needed because they were tied up I was able to find someone else immediately. I would personally like to recognize the banquet managers, Jonathan and Josh, and their staff for being quick to respond to changes as they came up. Our group had much more specialty meal restrictions than a group this size generally does. Many of the restrictions we didn\u2019t learn about until after the first meal was served. Jonathan and Josh were right on top of the changes, accommodated the on the spot requests, and came up with alternative meal plans for the remaining meals. All without missing a beat along the way. After meeting hours our attendees enjoyed the pool slide, jacuzzi, restaurant, and bar. The hotel staff made sure our attendees had everything they needed at all times. Finally, in a post seminar survey to our attendees we asked two questions specific to the meals and accommodations at this property. Our attendees rated the Sheraton Crescent a 4.55 out of 5.

We were disappointed that the water slide was broken during our stay, but how can we complain when the hotel staff called before our arrival to inform us of this? The pool and huge jacuzzi were operational, and we enjoyed them thoroughly. We were given a $5 voucher toward food or beverage at the hotel for not having maid service on the first night of our stay (our choice, not a problem on the part of the hotel!). I never have the maids come in anyway, so this was a great deal. The only minor complaint would be the charge for internet, which we passed up anyway. What makes this hotel so outstanding is the customer service. Every single employee went out of his or her way to make our family welcome. From the printed map with nearby restaurants clearly labeled to the bag of pastries on the house for the kids, I just can't say enough about the kindness of the employees. What put it just over the top was the fact that I wasn't charged for my second night because I checked out around 2 pm. I got the rooms for the second night just to make sure we didn't have to rush out the next day (which I have done at several hotels before while on \"staycations\"). I have NEVER had a hotel tell me that I didn't have to pay for the second night, no matter WHAT time I actually ended up checking out! One of the wonderful employees told me he hoped it made up for the water slide being broken. Are you KIDDING me? It would have made up for much more than that if there were anything to complain about!

He actually gave us a great rate and put us up in the club level, private area with its own club lounge that has refreshments, a business center, and flat screen HDTV and nice comfy sofas. We had family at the other Sheraton with a baseball team and that was fine for families with children, this was more for adults, and we were very happy with the choice. Thank you, Mr. Kuhns.

You can use the computers in the lobby for no fee or for short-term timed use in the Club Level lounge if you're staying on the Club 7th floor.

After spending several hours on Trip Advisor, reading reviews and stewing over locations and longingly looking over at Scottsdale I chose the Sheraton Crescent. When we arrived I was so surprised - the grounds were absolutely beautiful and it resembled an awesome resort - large lovely pool, two tennis courts and a grand entrance. We were graciously greeted and thoroughly taken care of. Our reservations were on the club level (highly recommend) and we spent the mornings and evenings in the club level lounge - beautiful views, spacious, large flat screen TV, and great ambience! The staff is so personable and is willing to help with whatever you need. The complimentary breakfast in the mornings were incredible. Fresh fruit, breakfast burritos, oatmeal, etc, etc. The evening appetizers were almost complete meals. Gourmet salads, cheese and fruit trays, hot appetizers and great service.

At one point I went to get some coffee and tea from some special guests, went to the cafe off the lobby and saw that it was closed.

The Food and Beverage Manager opened up the cafe, made all of the coffee/tea, offered to help take it to the meeting room and was completely service-oriented and I must say I was pretty impressed.

We had a few special dietary requests, and they honored each with lovely alternative options. In fact, our participants were jealous of those gluten-free desserts specially prepared by the Head Chef!

This was the first time i had an opportunity to personally experience being a guest in the hotel, and I was pleased to find that the rooms were spacious. In the little time I had to enjoy my room, I loved that there were free yoga and pilates workouts available on the TV! The computers available for use by hotel guests in the lobby were also quite convenient. Loved the ambience of the whole hotel, including the relaxed atmosphere of the lounge. Another thing I really appreciated was the hotel's \"green\" program, where they give you a gift card you can use to spend in their restaurant or gift shop when you waive housekeeping service. What a cool idea and it saved me some money on dinner! Great place for a business meeting or to bring the family for a weekend getaway. I highly recommend the Sheraton Crescent.

We booked on points, so not sure of the value, but the location was great and so was the hotel. We stayed on both our arrival into Arizona, then again on our departure 7 days later. We stayed here in route to Northern Arizona and was the perfect location for our family to rest for the night. We arrived early (before noon) and we were able to check in early, which was wonderful. We had a pool view room on the 6th floor and enjoyed the spacious, 2 double bed layout in both rooms. The bathroom is a single (with toilet, sink & shower in one space). The shower water was hot, and powerful. The rooms were clean and orderly. The television received adequate channels and included cartoon network, for the kids. The kids LOVED the slide into the pool at a separate location than the main pool. We arrived on a Sunday and not sure if that made a difference, but the kids loved the Watermelon eating contest, the music, the free pool toys and floats that were available to the guests. The adults loved the plentiful chairs, the free internet access, and the free self parking. On our 2nd stay, we enjoyed the movie by the pool on the following Sunday evening. Being gold members we were delighted with the breakfast lounge on the club level our first stay, and were happy to receive vouchers to the restaurant (in leiu of the unavailable club buffet) our 2nd stay. The food in the restaurant was very good and plentiful. Prices were average, ranging from $3 drinks to $18-$20 entrees at dinner and $8-$10 entrees at breakfast. Kids meals are $5 breakfast and I don't quite remember dinner prices ($6.99?). The staff was extremely nice....everyone from housekeeping, to the pool attendants. They were very aware of the guests and were sure to keep the kids in check at the slide area and at the pool. The 2nd stay, we were on the \"mountain view\" side I believe - it faced the highway anyway. No noise from the highway, although it's quite close. The only noise I recall was from a siren a couple of times, but that can happen anywhere probably. The location is great.... right across the highway from a shopping mall, and most major restaurants.

We flew in late at night for Spring Training. I researched which hotel to stay at the first couple nights that wasn't far from the airport or Peoria. I liked the location and pool area. I booked through Priceline. We took a cab to the hotel and got there about 11 p.m. We went to check in and were told they didn't have a room reserved for us, I showed them our confirmation and she wouldn't even look at me and said sorry but they had no rooms available. I asked her what were we suppose to do, it was 11 p.m., we had just flown in from Seattle, and taken a cab to the hotel - she said there was nothing they could do it was a third party reservation. I then asked her to help us find a room somewhere else, she never once looked me in the eye or showed any concern for our experience. She finally went into an office came back with the name of a hotel, and I asked if their shuttle service could take us there, she went back into the office and when she came back out she said the hotel didn't have any rooms, and in fact there was nothing avaiable because it was spring break. And walked away. I walked back up and waited for her, and again asked what we were suppose to do, she said she would get me set up with a temporary password on their internet to look for a room! That took forever. While waiting one family came to the desk because they were upset the pool slide was shut down, and stated that was why they chose the hotel, and then two more families came up to check in and both had reserved rooms with two beds and were told they only had rooms with king beds left. I know things happen, but in each case the front desk was not apologetic or helpful to these people, I had never seen such poor service. I called Priceline and got no answer, so I finally just got out my iphone located a hotel, I asked if they could call us a cab, she just walked away, so I looked up a cab on my iphone and we left the hotel. The next day I called Priceline and told them our story - they couldn't believe we had been treated so poorly, that the hotel was suppose to find us a room at another hotel, if the rate was higher pick up the difference and supply us with transportation at their cost. They contacted the hotel and were told there were no rooms available, and the manager was out, they would check back with us Monday after they spoke to the manager. We were contacted Monday and told to submit our receipts for our room and taxi and that the hotel would pick up the difference. Well the hotel was the same price, and we didn't have a receipt for the taxi because we paid cash. We ended up at the ramanda by the airport, and they were wonderful and offered us free breakfast buffet in the morning for all the hassle we had gone through. Every experience has a learning opportunity, and I found out that if you book third party, and hotel doesn't have your room and you have proof of a reservation, they are obligated to find you a room at another hotel and transportation to that hotel! The only good thing was we had not been billed for the hotel yet, so we didn't have to fight to get our money back! We stayed in 5hotels during this trip (Phoenix, Peoria, Sedona, Laughlin and Las Vegas - we aren't picky people nor hard to get along with, I understand things can go wrong, but on a scale from 1 to 5 the Sheraton didn't even get on the scale with the other hotels.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Staff Makes a Beautiful Hotel Even Better\u201d", "Author": "BBZ257", "ReviewID": "UR64741819", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Crescent in Phoenix with my grandmother.

You can tell the bar and restaurant areas were upgraded and also great service. Customer service here is as good as I've experienced at any Sheraton. My excitement about this place turns south when I enter my room. While it was a pretty nice size with flat=screen TV and sitting area, it's way outdated. Furniture, wall paper, carpet, and especially the bathrooms simply need a makeover. The bed was very comfortable, however, and AC worked very well (a must in Phoenix). Overall, it felt like I was staying in a 4 star hotel (lobby, bar, restaurant, exterior appearance) with 2 star accommodations (rooms and conference areas). Location is not the best either. If you don't eat at the restaurant in the hotel, your lunch options are few (and require a trip across very busy 4-lane traffic - at your own risk).

The pool area is relaxing and quiet, and there are several benches and shaded areas to sit. Tennis courts and workout facilities are nice. Everything is clean and the landscaping is pretty. The conference rooms where we had our meetings were spacious and kept at a comfortable temperature. They did a good job of having coffee and snacks available at all times. The rooms-comfortable and large enough to suit me. I did not think the decor was \"dated\" as so many stated. The balcony is too small to sit out on. The beds were great. The wireless worked fine. The room was clean enough but I have seen cleaner. Don't get me wrong- it was fine. I wished they would have vacumed but not a huge deal. They cleaned the bathroom well each day. I did not think the bathroom tile looked dated...I thought it was fine and I have seen much worse. Room service was prompt. The staff was friendly enough but I barely interacted with them. Bad - Very little negative to say. I would stay here again. My biggest complaint is beyond the control of the hotel--I just didn't care for the location. I would have liked to have been closer to Scottsdale and it is quite a hike. Other than that, you are right by 17 which will take you anywhere. Traffic can be congested near this hotel.

I love waterslides, and it's one of the reasons we chose this hotel. You would think they would repair the slide in the winter, not the spring, when the weather was absolutely gorgeous! Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The pool and spa were great (even without the slide). And the location of the hotel was great. But the perks end there. The elevator got stuck on the 5th floor. We went to the front desk to report the problem. Instead of being apologetic or thankful, the lady at the desk, named Pua, gave us an attitude. Then our electric key wouldn't let us into the gym. They say to access the gym from the second floor, but when you get to the second floor entrance, you have to take stairs down to the first floor. We went all the way down, and realized our key wouldn't work. Another guest was there, and her key didn't work either. So, we went back to Pua at the front desk. She was snotty with us. She took our key, gave it back to us, and told us to try again. We did. It still didn't work! We went back up to the front desk and back down to the gym again. Still no luck. Finally, another guest picked the lock and let us in. After our gym workout, our key wouldn't let us into our room! So, we had to go back to Pua. You would think she would give a care! But nope. Luckily another guy was there that time, and he went to our room with us to let us in and he gave us new keys. However, he never even asked for i.d.

Excellent value found around 80 euros online. Hotel is situated directly by I-17 freeway, about 10-15 minutes north from downtown Phoenix. Let's say it : area is not very fancy but you are close to everything (downtown, malls, airport) except maybe Scottsdale. However, expect no scenic views from rooms : freeway, offices buildings... and that's all... I've read controversial reports on this website about this hotel. Let's try to balance evrything. Okay it is probably old (70's ? 80's for the original construction ?), but It has been nicely renovated (probably 10-15 years ago. Entrance is beautiful with lush tropical vegetation. Lobby is very nice but it lacks light... The rooms are large : lots of space (I had a standard with kingbed, club level rooms are said to be exactly the same comfort). Cleanliness is really good everywhere in the room, and bed is top confort. Yet, I agree with some reports : the bathrooms are so-so if you look at details such as the bath tiles which look quite dated... But who really cares ? Shower is ok, bath is ok, sunk is ok, marble is bright... what else would you need in your bathroom ? TV and Safebox in the room are OK, but the room lacks minibar (but ice & vending machine are on your floor). OK, a few words about the restaurant : I had the breakfast buffet : 10 USD, worth it but it was only available for sunday (probably due to the presence of families). On working days (monday to thursday I stayed) only \"\u00e0 la carte\" breakfast (15-25 USD) was proposed to guests. Let's admit it : buffet or \"\u00e0 la carte\", food was not really tasty (overcooked scramble eggs, orange juice with no taste, fresh fruits so-so..) but it's OK if you need to eat something before a busy day, and staff is really nice and professional. I never had dinners there : in fact the restaurant seemed closed, or with just one or two tables with guests... strange atmosphere (or no atmosphere at all !!!). About the gardens & pools : gardens are nice and pool is heated. The hot tub is really warm. I noticed that the waterslide tobbogan was closed due to maintenance. Two tennis courts available. Free covered parking for guests. Conclusion : an excellent value with really good service, even if it lacks somewhat some atmosphere. The place is perfect for business travelers. Families may find better resort oriented hotels in Scottsdale however. It is, let's say it, probably in the bottom of the Sheraton standards...

It was not a king size bed, it was a queen that folded out of the wall, comfortable but not what I had in mind. Finally, I called concierge for a recommendation on where to eat in Downtown Phoenix. I was then transferred to someone else that informed me that he is not from Phoenix and was not familiar with Downtown. I asked if he could find someone that was and was told he would call me back.

We stayed for one night before travelling around Arizona. We did return there for a further two nights at the end of that week. Again we found the staff excellent, they even remembered our names and especially in assisting us with checking in for our next flights of our holiday. I would agree that if you were looking for pool facilities etc, they were a little on the small side. I would have no hesitation in using this hotel again.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim Hills, California", "Title": "\u201cI was very disappointed.......\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4824975", "Content": "We were very disappointed in this Hotel.

It is nice to receive a complimentary paper (everyday minus Sunday) and if you stay inside the hotel you will be pleased with the decor and style. The beds are quite comfortable! If you are planning on using the internet, be prepared to pay $16/day which I found outrageous! Now, if you are hoping to enjoy and relax at this hotel--it is definitely not a resort--stay in Scottsdale for that! The pool was quite small and quite dirty--the water slide is not staffed continually and you have to find staff to turn it on and monitor it--it also dumps into a small area that is only for the slide...not a place to have fun and relax and enjoy around the pool. We also happend to know more about the area than the concierge and the front desk staff was quite rude.

I particularly liked the down comforters and comfortable beds. The pool was great, as were the exercise facilities. The rooms were bright and cheery and had been recently renovated. They were always very clean, although one time I saw a cockroach in my bathroom -- I'll chalk that up to a freak occurance, since everything was very clean and well maintained. I have stayed at a couple of other hotels in the area (Courtyard, Fourpoints), and this one is my preference by far.

All served by a gracious staff. The wedding was held in Lady Mendl's sitting room which is in the main room. It was filled with candles (even the day before), fires in the fireplaces, and the smell of gardenia throughout. There was a beautiful old bar from which a bevy of delicious cocktails and champagne drinks were served.

My husband and I spent a weekend at Inn at Irving Place and were thrilled at the idea of staying in \"B&B\" type place in NYC. Some positives: great location, beautiful furniture and elegant things throughout, exciting to be staying in a beautiful brownstone (actually two that are combined) with a key to Grammercy Park, nice little touches such as plush towels, amenities in the bathrooms, and just a good \"feeling\" of being someplace special. Some negatives: sometimes these ideas are all in our heads. Just because a place is incredibly expensive, it doesn't mean it's worth it! And frankly, this place just wasn't worth the $500+ per night that was charged. There was something in my pillow that caused such a reaction in my face that my husband didn't recognize my swollen face in the morning. I was asked to hurry up and finish my cup of tea one morning because they had to get ready for a luncheon (bridal shower or something). I understand they want to take advantage of the whole Victorian setting that attracts the side business of showers and luncheons and tea parties, but they shouldn't push away their guests like that. If anything, they could set up another corner somewhere for those of us \"in their way.\" I also didn't find the front desk people all that kind. One in particular, a tall gay guy with very fashionable clothing, was almost uppity. That wasn't necessary.

I am so glad that I did. I arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon. The staff was VERY friendly and VERY attentive. My room - the Gramercy - was ready, so they let me check in. The bellman took my luggage and we legged it up to the top floor (2 flights). After the bellman left, I began exploring the room. The more I explored, the more disappointed I became. Here is a list of problems: 1) There are two swing-arm lamps above the bed. The installation was very shabby (in a place like this, they should have cord covers). One of the lamps had a big dent. The arms were loose. The housings (where the lamps connect to the wall) were loose. 2) There were candelabra-style wall sconces on two of the walls. They were shabby and loose. And one of the sconces had a \"candle\" that was held on with electrical tape. It was leaning at a curious angle. 3) The radiators could use a coat of fresh paint. 4) There was plenty of upholstered furniture that looked was very nicely done. Unfortunately, none of it was comfortable. 5) There was no desk. I had to use the coffee table for my laptop. 6) The shutters were flimsy at best. There were 6 sets of shutters in the room - upper and lower for each of the three windows. Only one set would latch properly. I ended up using rubber bands to latch the others. 7) The dresser was an old Empire-style behemoth with drawers that had gaps in the bottoms. The drawers were very loose and I had to be careful to make sure I pulled them out carefully so that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly out and land on my feet. 8) The mini-bar was out of order. There was a printed sign in a frame, which makes me think that this is a frequent occurrence. There were some bright spots. 1) The room was very spacious and faced a courtyard. Even though the restaurants that border the property were hopping that night, I was not bothered by any music or noise. As a matter of fact, that was the first night I ever spent in Manhattan where my sleep was not interrupted by garbage trucks or sirens. 2) The queen-sized bed was very comfy and the linens were what I expected from a luxury property. 3) The closet had an extra blanket, iron and ironing board. 4) The bathroom was roomy. The outlets were right next to the mirror. They had a side table that was big enough to hold all of my toiletries. The towels were thick and thirsty. The shower was roomy. And the water pressure was great. I did not eat at the inn, so I have no comments on the restaurant or the food. I own a 130-year old farmhouse, so I can deal with a bit of shabby and I wasn't expecting the slickness of a modern boutique hotel. But for $325 a night, the room should, at the very least, be properly maintained. I will not be staying here again.

The hotel has a Go-Board, which is the latest in technology. You can find weather, news, restaurants, and other information on this board. The afternoon check-in woman helped us find a restaurant, printed out the directions, and called to make us a reservation. We wanted a drink at the Bistro at about 4:45. The Bistro doesn't open until 5:00, but the individual behind the bar was gracious enough to serve us. We even said we would wait until he opened, but he said he would be happy to serve us before opening. When we needed ice, my husband went to look for it, ran into the manager of the property, and she got the ice for him! Unheard of in a larger hotel.

Here are my comments: Checking In: After flying overnight from Honolulu, I arrived at the hotel at about 11:00 am. The gentleman that assisted me was very helpful and the best part was he was able to check me in early. Something I really appreciated considering I cannot sleep on the plane. The person told suggested I drive around the building becasue the elevator was closer to the back door. Room: I was in the standard room on the third floor. If my memory serves me correctly, there was only three floors and I had the room facing the back of the hotel so there was no noise at night. The room had a refrigerator and the internet worked well. Location: As others have mentioned, this hotel is located in a business area, with several companies in the surrounding area. The only restaurant I saw that was within a walking distance was a Karl Strauss Brewery. I did not go but it looked busy. Down the road (you could walk it, but there is a busy intersection and it's kind of hilly), there is a small shopping area that has a McDonalds, a food court, a bank, and some other businesses including a gas station. The food court closes at 4:30 with several other eateries closing later. I did not see a supermarket near by, however I did not ask the front desk for any. Downtown San Diego is about 15 miles away. If you don't have a car, it could take a while to get there. I drove to Pacific Beach and it took about 15 minutes. Pacific Beach is a beach community with several restaurants and grocery stores. I heard La Jolla is nearby, I did not check it out myself. I can say that Torrey Pines took me about 20 minutes to drive to and from during a week day afternoon. Negatives: The only minor negative was the entrance to the hotel. When you are driving, you might have to turn left into the drive. Most of the drivers was nice enough for me to drive in, but if you are there when the workers from the nearby building are going home, it can be kind of scary turning into the driveway. There is a second entrance as you go up the hill, but it was closed when I was there. As you can see, my only complaint was very minor. This Courtyard achieved it's purpose. If you stay here, I would recommend having a car especially if you wish to go to downtown San Diego. I did not try the public transportation, and maybe it might work for some of you. But to get around, it would be better with a car.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBest Courtyard I've ever stayed at!\u201d", "Author": "Shannon_Bradshaw", "ReviewID": "UR123670428", "Content": "I was so impressed with this Courtyard - I can't say enough good things about it! I'll be honest, I didn't make the reservations and have no idea how much we paid, so I am not evaluating this for 'value for the money' but it's a Courtyard - I can't imagine it was much more than any other one. The little Starbucks bistro served a great breakfast, and even the evening drinks were fantastic. I loved the layout of the lounge and the lobby. It was quick, efficient, friendly, and inviting. It was certainly hipper than any Courtyard I've ever seen. The rooms were spacious and well laid-out, and the bathroom was perfect. The only issues I had during my stay was that the gym was full between 6 and 7:30, so I had to wait for equipment (longest wait was only 10 mins) and there was quite a bit of sand in the tap water - so much that when I arrived there was sand in the bathtub, and the next day, after I brushed my teeth, there was a ring of sand in the sink. So don't drink the tap water. (Sand in the water is new to me, yucky tap water at a hotel is pretty normal.) All-in-all, I say this is a fantastic hotel!

Close to Del Mar, La Jolla Beach and Sea World. The lobby is beautiful. The flat screen in the lobby is a touch screen info. directory. Able to use to find restaurants. Our room they checked us in was NASTY. Wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off behind the toilet and the shower curtain was moldy and something SMELLED. Called front desk and requested to change rooms right away. Front desk employee named Tommy changed us ASAP! That was wonderful. However, although the next room was much, much better and smelled cleaner, we lifted one of the bedsheets to put down our infant and saw pieces of hair ALL over the fitted sheet inside!!!! I picked off a bunch of them and just got toooooo frustrated as well as grossed out that I had to call the front desk again and told Tommy to send up fresh sheets!!!!!!!! I had to change everything down to the yellow stained mattress pad. I had to replace the sheets myself with the help of the housekeeping personnel. The bathroom in this new room was much better. At least the wallpaper was intact and the room smelled fresher. The workout room was substandard. The air conditioner was not working however I called engineering right away and he fixed it within a 1/2 an hour. Unfortanately, my workout was 3/4 over! The restaurant downstairs was only open for breakfast and dinner. NOT LUNCH! That sucked especially with having kids. Would've loved food readily available all day. The nearby Starbucks, Quiznos, JambaJuice and other restaurants down the street closes super EARLY. Starbucks at 5pm, Quiznos at 3p. That sucked too! The hotel staff at the front desk NEVER SMILED, seemed unhappy (except for Tommy). The hotel room door must be made of plywood. Can hear everything in the hallway from the inside. Can hear another door slamming down the hallway. Can hear the elevator lobby of people coming in and out. That sucked! They should replace all the doors to muffle the outside noise. Last but not least, on our last night we arrived late and parked in the back of the hotel where there was an entrance into the rooms. Unloaded 3 of our half asleep children along with heavy bags. Used the key card to open the doors to enter and THEY DID NOT WORK!!!! Had to pack the kids back into the car and my husband walked with the stroller with all three bags in tow all the way to the front of the hotel to tell the front desk what had happened. All he said was, \"oh, must of been demagnitized from either a cell phone or computer.\" We told him that was impossible seeing that we had left both of them inside the glove compartment alllllll day. All he did was shrug his shoulders! What a bad way to end the day. The next morning we checked out and was soooooo happy to help ourselves with the compliementary coffee downstairs only to see that the cannisters were empty!!!!!! Great way to end our stay! Will not stay again and neither should you.

Getting to any of the sites of SD took about 30 minutes driving. The hotel room was great and had a refrigerator. There was a nice hot breakfast buffet every morning. Although we did not use it, the pool looked beautiful. There is free coffee in the lobby all day and there was free high speed internet in the rooms. My only issues with the hotel were the distance from tourist attractions (not the hotel's fault) and the expensive room price. I got a Residence Inn condo (2 BR, 2 BA) in LA for less than this room.

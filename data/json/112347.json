I had called ahead and requested a quiet room due to past reviews read on Trip Advisor. The desk clerk indicated that the hotel was full to capacity and that we'd need to wait until 3pm to check in. As we walked away with our bags he said that he 'just found' a room on a high, quiet floor that we could go to immediately, however there would be an extra $20/day with tax. The only upgrade to the room was 'better bedding', as he put it. We agreed to take the room, as we were tired from the long flight from the east coast. The room was satisfactory and appeared to be in the middle of a renovation, nice bedding, newly tiled bathroom, however the carpets looked original to the 1920's building and the baseboards were all scuffed and dirty. We settled in for a good nights sleep and were awakened each morning at 5:45a.m. to the clanking of coffee cups and pouring water in buckets by housekeeping - as their closet was just outside our door. So much for sleeping in..... Oh, and do bring your own toiletries. Two of us shared one tiny bottle of shampoo for three days. On the third day I called the front desk and asked them if they did not replentish toiletries and he said that he would send someone from housekeeping up right away. In about five minutes there was a knock at the door and an older man stood there and barged past me and said 'I want to see'. He proceeded to brush past me and went into the bathroom to 'see for himselft that we were out of soap and shampoo'. He left and came back with a sack of two items each and shoved it at me and said 'will this be enough'? Wow, that's never happened to me at a hotel before. Made me wish that we'd used out Marriott points and stayed there with our executive privileges. We tipped the maid everyday generously, so I didn't see what the big deal was about toiletries. On the bright side the hotel was close to Union Square. The entire property looked like it needed a good cleaning. They need to send their employees to a concierge school to learn how to treat guests. I would not stay here again.

I wasn't expecting a modern, luxury room and had previously stayed in other older hotels in the downtown area, so I had reasonable expectations. Our check-in was late due to plane delays. We were assigned to a very small room that had an entrance inside an alcove which made it awkward for rolling in the luggage. The room was very dark when all of the lights were turned on and did not have adequate space for unpacking two suitcases. Upon entering, the room was quite cold as the thermostat was off; but the heater did not work at all even when turned on for more than ten minutes. I called down to the front desk and was informed that I could come downstairs to get keys for another room, but there did not seem to be anyone available to check it out. We changed to a room down the hallway which was a bit larger (which then made me wonder why we weren't assigned there initially). This room was more comfortable; but the heat couldn't be adjusted when on, so we had to keep the window open a bit. This made us more susceptible to street noise which sounded like clanging trash bins being collected at night. I didn't mind the small size of the bathroom which was plentifully stocked with toiletries including toothpaste, but the height of the sink vanity was quite low. The alarm on the clock radio malfunctioned the next morning, and we overslept to find no hot water available. TV reception was limited to local stations. The biggest asset of the hotel is its location. The lobby is charming. In the morning there was coffee available, and in the afternoon there were live musicians playing during tea and sherry service. The business center had computers and printer for free guest use. I am unsure whether or not I'd give this place another try.

It is situated right next to Union square - literally a 50m walk at most! This is it's biggest selling point! Union square in all reality, is the best place to stay in San Francisco. Being close to Powell St as well, you are very close to a couple of cable car stops as well (essential for getting to Fishermans Wharf and great fun to ride). There is a Walgreens just around the corner (supermarket) which is also handy. As you walk out the doors of the hotel, to your right are 2 little sandwich / delis (both before you get to the street corner). Both are fantastic for breakfast, lunch or a meal. Highly recommend them. Well priced and very tasty food. They are small places, but are great. Sears is also just around the corner on Powell St which is an institution in SFran. We were told the breakfast was great, but only ended up going to dinner there. Quite a decent more \"home cooked\" American style meal that won't break the bank. The hotel itself is quaint. It is an old style hotel but still looks in good condition. The check in staff are very friendly and the concierge (Ron) is brilliant! The hotel has an ATM in the foyer - was not expecting this for a boutique hotel. There are also major bank ATMs just around the corner on Powell as well. There are no in-room safes (bit of a negative as the closets are big enough to have one) - so on check in make sure you ask for a check in desk safe as they can run out. Also, no small fridge (seriously, all hotels should have one for the convenience of their customers and not have to pay extra for it - in Australia and Asia, I have yet been to a hotel that does not have one!). Wifi is free - which is great! We found in too many hotels in US that we had to pay for Wifi ;( The room is compact but not like the tiny European hotel rooms. For a week stay, it was comfortable. The bed was good. The bathroom - needs renovation. It does not have to be massive, but the taps and shower heads need to be replaced - as they are getting old. The restaurant next door (the Farallon) - don't bother. It is overpriced and the service is (well at least what we experienced), very poor.

We will definitely come back... The only thing we would improve is the toilet.. it was small and short.... and the lighting in the bathroom (a little dim). Construction at the entrance wasn't very attractive, but that is temporary and will be probably be beautiful when it is finished. Loved the artsy life size horse in the lobby. No afternoon sherry while we were there.. a disappointment. Everything else was heavenly. Be sure to have breakfast next door at the Cafe La Taza.

I requested for a foam pillow 3 times from the hotel staff before someone got back to me and say that they are not available. I was quite annoyed by that. They need to work on staff communication and follow up of customer's request. Complimentary wifi was a dream and connection was fast except for 1 night which had technical issues.

Lots of restaurants and cafe nearby and 2 Walgreens for your daily neccessities. For good value and delicious Thai food, try Bangkok just down the street.

I'm very picky about where we stay since I've had some terrible hotel experiences in the past at supposedly \"upscale\" hotels. I'm happy to report that the Kensington Park provided a fantastic stay over five nights. We checked in late and there were no issues. I'd had to create two separate reservations in advance since we added a night onto our stay after I'd made the first reservation and when I went back into the system to extend it, the room type I'd booked wasn't available for the extra night. However, when we checked in, they not only gave us the corner king room I'd originally booked, but they gave us that night at the same rate as I'd booked for the lesser room. The hotel is older, but it's got a ton of character (in a good way). It was *extremely* clean and the staff was *extremely* friendly. The bed was fantastic - so comfortable, to the point where I actually slept in late a few mornings. The bathroom was small, but well-appointed, with a hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste and makeup remover towelettes provided. The view was fantastic - the corner king rooms have windows on two walls, so we overlooked Nob Hill on one side and Union Square on the other. There's a coffee maker in the room, but they also provide coffee and orange juice mid-way down the hall, and coffee, tea and water in the lobby in the morning. The location is good - just off Union Square, although they were doing major sidewalk work outside the entrance. It was about a five-10 minute walk from the Powell St. BART station, and there are lots of restaurants very close by, including one of the best seafood restaurants in the city that's literally connected to the lobby of the hotel (they have great happy hour deals on fresh oysters and drinks). The only minor detail is that there's no heater in the room; since we visited in November and it was cold/rainy for half of our trip, the room got pretty cold, although you could call and have a heater brought up to you. However, the bed was so warm that once I got into it, the need for a heater was gone. In fact, the first night we were there, we slept with the windows cracked and we were totally fine. Would we stay there again? Yes, absolutely. The Kensington Park is a charming hotel with friendly staff, great amenities (free wifi!) and a good location.

(FYI -- this is not a recent review) I started dating my wife in April of 1996. In September, we made our first trip together as a couple, and decided on San Francisco as a destination. I had contacted my travel agent and told him I wanted something romantic, close to everything and reasonably priced. He asked if I needed anything else and I suggested either a violinist or spanish guitar player in a courtyard playing up to her in the evenings. While the musicians never materialized, everything else was met to perfection with his booking of the Kensington Park for us. Upon check-in, we were told that our travel agent had gotten us an upgrade. We took our keys and headed up to our floor. As I walked down the hallway, I read the room numbers, looking room #920: 912, 914, 916... the last two doors were marked \"Presidential Suite.\" \"No way,\" I thought and tried the key. The door opened on about 2000 square feet of opulence: lead crystal chandelier above the 12 person dining table, two full bathrooms with jacuzzi's, a reading/music area and an oversized king bed on a pedestal sitting four feet off the floor, with a control panel on the wall for the fireplace, television, lights and curtains! Wow! The staff at the Kensington was nothing short of sensational. Everyone there offered their opinions on restaurants, tours, activities, shopping... they were all great! Here's a hot tip: there are 22 restaurants that will deliver to the Kensington Park! You never have to leave the hotel. I have a photograph of my wife lounging on a couch in our suite, looking like the cat who ate the canary! It's one of my favorite pictures of all time. The Kensington Park Hotel was instrumental in the formation of a relationship that led to a great marriage and I will always look fondly on our days and nights there.

I am not sure if this is dependent on the type of room but majority of hotels do have mini refrigerators. If you want to order food and have it delivered to your room, you need to order from the outside restaurants and you have to do it before 7pm.

I would have written a review sooner, but never seemed to have the time so here it goes. I really liked the Kensington Park Hotel. The lobby was old fashioned and quite nice. I believe they served tea and sherry in the lobby at 4:00 in the afternoon on a daily basis as well. The front desk staff were very nice to us during our stay. The rooms were modern with flat screen tv's and comfortable king beds. We had a higher floor so noise on the street didn't bother us. Bathrooms were small, but clean, and amenities were replaced daily. Rooms were also on the smaller size, however, this is a boutique hotel and that is expected. Besides if you are in San Fran you should only be in your room to nap from time to time and get a good nights sleep so room size shouldn't be an issue. Actually, I live outside of New York City and I can safely say that it costs us more money for a room half the size of the Kensington's rooms when we are back home. The thing I enjoyed the most about the hotel though was the location. It is half a block from Union Square! It's literally down the street. Besides that, it is around the corner from Sear's Fine Foods where you will get an amazing breakfast-especially the swedish pancakes with boysenberry jam. To die for! Just make sure you get there early (before 8 a.m.) or you will have a very long wait to eat. Other places I recommend to eat are Ghiardhelli's for dessert, Max's on the Square (right around the block) for dinner, Boudine's on Fisherman's Wharf for dinner, In n Out Burger anytime you can get your hands on it and Carabou Coffee for some extra energy. Stay away from Mel's Diner! I know, I know, it's so nostalgic with the milk shakes and the pictures from American Graffiti, but the food is terrible. I had roast chicken that was so dry I couldn't even eat it and my husband had a chicken pot pie that had a chicken leg bone baked into it. Needless, to say we didn't go back. And don't listen to the parking lot guys down at Fisherman's wharf that tell you to eat at Aliotto's. Not only was the food overpriced and inedible, but the staff were beyond rude. Shame we gave them any of our money when Boudine's is a thousand times better! As for a siteseeing tip- Go to the Alcatraz night tour. It's only on Thursday nights and it fills up fast. We booked our tickets five months in advance! Make sure you wear sneakers there too because you walk uphill for a fair amount of time once you get there. Also, if you want to rent a car (there is a fee for parking at the hotel) there are two rental car places within a couple of blocks. We rented a car at Avis and had a blast going to Napa, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Sonoma and Muir Woods...all worth the travel time. Plus, it's great to drive over the bridge and have breakfast in Sausalito. I would without a doubt stay at the Kensington Park Hotel again because of it's great location, cleanliness and affordability.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt was alright\u201d", "Author": "Mystelody", "ReviewID": "UR108655336", "Content": "I stayed one night at this hotel to attend an event around Union Square.

More quirky things: The doorman, Bob, was so friendly (he is an anglophile) I could not hear my husband checking in.

Union Square a beggar magnet in the way UK city centres are not. Lots of drugged up wrecked and desperate people. If that would spoil your dinner stay outside the centre. Two top tips for San Francisco: Buy a pass for the city transport for $18 for three days - worth it even for two. Single cable car rides are $5 each alone. I think you will want at least two rides, plus it gets you onto buses and trams and the metro. Go to Mission (Mexican) district on the BART railway (24 St Mission). Lots of extremely cheap authentic Mexican food. Supposed to be the best food outside (or possibly even inside) Mexico. Every San Franciscan has a favourite. These places are generally basic - burrito and a beer at a hatch. For more of an evening out try Valencia street, 16 St Mission. And only one block out of the station.

I happen to like old buildings, so the fact that the door sill between the room carpet and the hall carpet showed wear just added to the charm for me. The stairwell had a cool brass railing and other old fashioned touches are here and there. There is no AC, but there is a ceiling fan. This goes back to the old building issue and the fact that SF is usually quite cool and AC would be only needed about 2-3 days a year anyway. The walls are not soundproof (building materials were not as advanced back then), and I could hear the neighbors talking, opening/shutting doors, TVs, etc. With that said, I would definitely stay here again because that's what you have to expect in downtown SF.

Due to a little bit of Post Street noise very early on a morning, i did find myself waking up briefly a couple of times, but due to the location it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just something that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be helped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c besides, it really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us and soon went back to sleep until the alarm went off! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic old building with loads of charm and original features, and the lobby is small but still manages to be quite grand. The hotel offers free use of their internet using the PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the business centre for those travelling without laptops. Also there is free tea and coffee available early in the mornings at certain areas in the hotel. Try the Pinecrest Diner close to the hotel for breakfast. My wife and i tried loads of breakfast places in the surrounding area and found the Pinecrest to be the best place (open 24hrs). If you happen go to a place called Lori's Diner (a 50's themed joint), don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the one up the stairs opposite H&M - make sure you go to the other branch which is very close to the Pinecrest Diner on Mason Street (at Geary). This one was far superior! Alsobe sure to have a drink at the Clock Bar located in the lobby of the Westin St Francis hotel across the street. It's a bit posh and quite pricey but a great little bar with a really nice atmosphere. Overall, The Kensington Park Hotel is a fab hotel set in an even better location which is perfect to see all of the San Francisco sights, and i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d certainly stay here again.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "LondonReena", "ReviewID": "UR70624798", "Content": "This is a great place to stay when visiting San F.

Then it would stop and then start again. I called the front desk about it and they said, \"We'll send someone to your room.\" I told them my room wasn't the problem. The walls and windows at this hotel are so thin you hear everything in the room next to you and all the street noise below which goes on ALL night. There was constant pounding somewhere in or adjacent to the hotel for what seemed endless early one morning while sleeping. In addition, doors to adjacent rooms were constantly being slammed, and I don't mean once, I mean over and over and over as if the door wasn't shutting properly. This happened at all hours along with parents arguing and children yelling. The bedding was very poor and worn-out. Don't stay here if you have allergies! Free wireless internet was slow and completely down late July 3rd into the evening of July 4th. On the plus side, the hotel is in a convenient location and the staff were helpful and pleasant most of the time. The room description said there would be a mini-bar or frig. This was not true so I asked for one only because I have medication that needs refrigeration. The staff was good enough to put a small frig in my room although it was not very cold.

Cal. in a rental car. Instead of paying to keep it and park it in S.F., we dropped our bags at the hotel, returned the car to the airport and found it an easy trip back on the BART to our hotel. We were also close enough to walk to Chinatown and felt very safe doing so at night with our children. The hotel lobby was very nice. The staff well-trained and gave great service. The room was on the small side. With 2 double beds and a desk and dresser, the room was too full to comfortably put a suitcase on the floor without having to step over it to get around. The closet was very small as well. Luckily, the bathroom was a decent size and we could put one of our small suitcases in there. Bathroom was clean and shower was fine, but not the greatest water pressure. The beds were very comfortable with nice linens and duvets. Decor was also very pleasing and updated. Our room did not have a ceiling fan, and as some other reviewers pointed out -- was a bit stuffy -- even in March -- with no A/C. However, we did open our window (and put the kids in the bed that was not next to the window) and the staff also provided us with a small tabletop fan that worked quite well. The hotel was quiet and we had a good night's sleep. Overall, I was happy with our accomodations. I liked the uniqueness of the boutique hotel. The quality was good, and the price was great.

I honestly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest paying more than $50/night. We arrived at the hotel on a Friday morning and wanted to drop off our bags. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be able to check in right away. The desk clerk told us that our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready, but there was a much nicer room with a king bed and a view that was ready. Oh goody, we thought, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to get upgraded! And she said that we could have it for $20 more per night. We declined. Not the best way to start the trip. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be able to check in right away, but I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the tricky up-sell. She asked for our voucher. What voucher, we asked? She had our reservations, but still insisted that we give her a voucher from lastminutetravel.com. This company does not send vouchers. Arghh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so she took a copy of our email confirmation instead. She suggested that we come back after one and perhaps a room would be ready then. We dropped our luggage and returned at close to two. When we came back, our room was ready, and we asked for our luggage. There was now a different desk clerk, and she went to get our luggage and then returned and said that somebody would bring it up to our room. Um\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take our luggage now. As you can see, we are thrifty travelers, and did not want to be obligated to tip somebody for bringing up our two carry-ons that we are perfectly capable of bringing up ourselves. The desk clerk was not pleased, and visibly scowled. She went back into the luggage room and continued to search for our luggage. Apparently, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it, which was why she said somebody would bring it to our room. Finally with the help of (the concierge?), she was able to locate our luggage. We were on the leper floor with some sort of Elks facility and a business center. Our room was fine, but nothing nice. Here are some things we noticed about the room: * The bed sheets are ancient and thread-bare. There is a little sign next to the bed encouraging you to not get your sheets changed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen these before and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not been particularly perturbed, but this one was especially scolding, saying, in all caps, MAKE THE DECISION FOR YOURSELF. *There is no air conditioning, and the ceiling fan rattles if you put it above the lowest setting. *There is a lot of street noise, especially drunk people at night. *There is no shower cap. *The toilet paper is very thin. *There were stray hairs in the bathroom. *There are very few television channels. Here are some things we noticed about the hotel: *The elevator certificate has been expired for over a year. *D\u00c3\u00a9cor is sloppy and crookedly placed. Not a big deal, but there is a clear inattention to detail. *Front desk clerks are ignorant at best, and willful liars at worst. Along with our check-in experience, we talked to the front desk regarding shuttles to Oakland Airport. I was told that it would cost the same amount to take a taxi with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred company as it would to take a shuttle. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually 30% more. They were no help in finding airport transportation. All and all, not a pleasant stay. It just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comfortable, and it sure didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel special.

All this had been booked six months previously. However we moved next day and were pleased to be in a quiet, slightly larger room (none of the two bedded rooms are very large) with a very pleasant view across Nob Hill. Bathroom was immaculate and beds extremely comfortable, but some of the room fittings were a bit tired and dated. Unfortunately we were opposite the Royal Suite and on Saturday there was a function in there. We were woken at around midnight, and kept awake until 2.30am, by the revellers across the hall. We (and others) complained to reception and we did hear someone ask the party to keep the volume down. It would have been nice to have been forewarned though - especially after our initial inconvenience of having to move rooms. But as our stay progressed we began to appreciate staying in a small boutique hotel. The staff were excellent, particularly Dorothy, Gloria, Joshua on reception and Bob the concierge. They really make the place. My sister went home to Australia as booked but I was stranded by the ash cloud. The hotel moved me to a one bedded room and kindly reduced the room rate for me. I was stuck on my own, uncertain of when I would get a flight back to the UK. The staff were most sympathetic and I was so glad to be in the Kensington Park, rather than an impersonal 400 bed hotel. It was a very stressful situation and I cannot praise the staff highly enough for their kindness towards me. The earlier problems faded into insignificance.

Additionally, there are great amenities (Walgreens, coffee shops, breakfast places, etc) right around the corner.

We were early in our arrival and they gave us several choices of rooms (explained front vs. back of building; choice of king v. queen bed, etc). Our room didn't disappoint. It faced a building, but we didn't care - the room is a great size (definitely a city hotel size) and the bathroom was pretty large as well. Our bathroom only had a shower (once again, they had given us a choice upon check in) but it suited us just fine and it was actually really large. The Kensington staff is tremendous.

While in San Francisco we did the following trips:- - Boat trip to Alcratraz and Golden Gate bridge - Trolley tour of city - defiantly worth while for seeing the different sites - Hire car to Napa Valley. Visited Sonoma, petrified forest, Ye Old Faithful geyser and wineries. Defiantly worth doing. - visit China town, pier 39, Coit tower - great meal in North Beach at Calzone's on Columbus", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Dorado Hills, CA", "Title": "\u201cWhat a bargain!\u201d", "Author": "Maggie1101", "ReviewID": "UR23986262", "Content": "I kept thinking I would discover why the room rate was so cheap, but instead found the location, linens, view, TV, updated bathroom, doorman, valet parking, more than I excepted or even hoped for.

This site was invaluable to me whilst I was painstakingly researching hotels, tours, etc and it was the reviews here that convinced me I was booking the right place for my fussy mum, my 5-year old daughter and myself. We arrived at the hotel around 6 in the morning. The lone guy at the reception was very pleasant, said no rooms were available then and would give special instructions to the maid service when they arrived at 9am (or something) to do a rush job for us. We slept on the sofas and armchairs, and a little later, that guy told me that he had a good room for me - room 50, 9th floor, facing Nob Hill. When I inquired about the room a few hours later, a lady (who had taken over from the first nice guy) told me ,rather accusingly and curtly, that the room was still unavailable and that check-in was actually 3pm, implying that they were doing me a favour. Well, excuuuse me, I was just asking, was very polite, and didn't say or do anything to warrant that reaction from her. But she was a minor blip. Got to the room around 10am - tastefully done, taupe walls, dark brown furniture, high beds, huge pillows, unnecessary faux brown fur throws on beds, brown crystal chandelier, glass stemmed table lamps, large LCD wall telly, velvet-lined drawers!, roomy bathroom, glass! wastepaper basket, shower-in-bathtub combo, H2O brand toiletries, no fan (but it was chilly at night anyway), coffee-maker (good for warm drinks at night only since fresh coffee was available down the corridor every morning anyway), The San Francisco Chronicle every day. Small walk-in closet. Watch the doors, tho', they slam hard. Ice maker at noisy 'beverage room' next to room 51. Ice makers found at floors 9 & 12 only. Classy clean quiet view of a hotel - Fairmont? - it's beautiful at night with the uplit flag fluttering in the wind. Didn't hear any refuse trucks in the morning. Could occasionally hear the dingdingding of the cable cars even tho' I was away from the main street - imagine the din if you stayed facing Post Street. Location is fantastic - cable car stops right at the corner where the Disney shop used to be. Shopping is everywhere! The BART, cable car turnaround, MUNI stops are all very near - it might seem a bit farther because you just can't walk there in a straight line - the sidewalks are packed with people. Don't stay at the Fisherman's Wharf area - I found it dirty, repetitive, same shops, same stuff and Ghiradelli Square/ The Cannery etc so-called shopping hubs were ghost-towns. What happened to them? Instead, stay at the Union Square area, enjoy being the tourist, buy the 3-day MUNI pass and ride the cable cars to death. They are fun, pass through great places with great views and climb the hills you don't wanna climb. The staff are commendable and I'm not just saying that because I'm comparing them to the lackadaisical gloomy staff at the Waikiki Resort Hotel in Oahu I endured a few days earlier. Ask them anything and they really jump to it. I asked for a small refrigerator and by the time I took the lift up to my room, closed my door and put the door card on the dresser, one of the staff was already at my door with the mini-fridge. In all of 2 minutes! The hotel represents Grayline Tours and the concierge will happily help you with bookings. I asked the night concierge, a sweetie called Christian, which side of the tour bus I should sit while on the 17-mile drive/Monterey/Carmel tour. He was unsure and immediately began calling Grayline. When I spoke with him a few hours later, he was hunched over his laptop trying to get an answer. He later left a message with my mum - sit on the right side. He was right. I got all the best views and video shots, something you couldn't do on the drive back because the driver took the inland highways, not the coastal roads. Thank you, Christian. The day concierge, Robert, whilst looking kinda gruff, took pains to make us feel at home by telling us about other hotel guests from where I'm from. I booked the airport shuttle with him and later changed a few details about the timing etc . Earlier on, I also made a few changes to the tour bookings with Grayline which Christian had helped me with. Both Christian and Robert immediately reached for the phone to rectify everything - no hesitation, no-err-ehmm-why-don't-you-stick-with-the-original-plan-it's-so-troublesome-for-me-to-rearrange-everything vibe. The pretend-concierge at the Hawaii hotel actually told me to use the public phone when I asked for help to re-confirm tours. Sheesh! I loved staying at Kensington and miss it already. Nice to have your every whim catered to. A few parting tips - if you're not patronising the Farallon Restaurant at the ground level but love looking at its surreal jellyfish ceiling lights, you can stop at the 4th floor - there are a couple of jellyfish on the ceiling there. I'm sure the security cameras watching me video the lights thought I was insane but the lights are soo unusual. And don't book Grayline's day city tour - it was HUGELY disappointing. I was expecting a tour guide, you know, a human being. We got a headphone-pre-recorded-narration-kind-of-tour with hordes of other tourists on a double-decker bus. I was shell-shocked and felt cheated. (When I was researching tours a few months ago, I found a lot of positive buzz about this San Fran Shuttle tours, how it made a point of letting guests get off at as many points of interest as possible. I thought all city tours did that and didn't think much of it. Plus, they were more expensive than Grayline. Big mistake. We didn't even SEE the Painted Ladies or the Palace of Fine Arts, much less get OFF the bus at these places. We got off at only 3 places - the Mission Dolores (only for 25minutes - which left no-one time to take the $5 guided tour ANYWAY, and lots of passengers didn't even get off), Twin Peaks and some vista point for the Golden Gate Bridge (come on, the driver HAD to stop at the bridge; he would have been attacked otherwise.)

We found the rooms generously sized with actual walk in closets. The beds are very comfortable with nice comforters. We appreaciated the two chairs and the wealth of restaurant literature in the room. Our first room was 51, on the 9th floor. It had a great view of Nob Hill, a very nice bathroom with a shower instead of a tub. The complimentary morning coffee service was directly across from our door, incredibly convenient, and not at all noisy. We had a complimentary newspaper in the morning, and a complimentary afternoon tea and sherry in the Lobby. The staff were quite pleasant and very helpful. After a less than satisfactory stay the next weekend at another close by major hotel, we switched back to the smaller, more intimate Kensington Park for our final night in San Francisco. Our room was lower, with no view, but the closet and bath were still large and the room spacious. It was the same level of comfort and security that we had experienced two weeks before. It was relief to return to the Kensington Park. The Lobby is gorgeous, and there is a theatre and function rooms in the KP along with an Elks Lodge. The KP's location is close to buses, cable cars, and subway. Terrific restaurants, that always had a table available, are close by along with jazz and night clubs. Chinatown is a close walk, and you are in shopping central, Union Square is just 1/2 block away. There is a Hertz rental location around the corner. The KP is vintage, so you get a few quirks, but nothing that interferes with your comfort. You don't get that stuffy feeling of the old 5 star hotels that have had the vintage stripped out of them. The KP has been updated to modern sensibilities without losing its original charm. The rooms and baths are superior to that un-named hotel, with the fancy dressed doorman, around the corner. The staff and service at the KP are so much better as well. We would highly recommend the Kensington Park as a lovely place to stay while you're in San Francisco.

Housekeeping would call us to ask if we wanted our room cleaned, even if we had a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door - what if we were taking a nap? It was because housekeeping leaves at 4 everyday so you can't get anything after that time. There was a pink stain on my comforter when we got there. We used the same sheets for 4 nights, then I left the \"please wash these sheets\" sign on the bed so they would change the sheets (clean them). The pink stain was still there when we got home and our sheets had been \"cleaned\", which means they don't change the sheets when you are there or in between guests. This, to me, was a very, very big CON. Gross! The room was really noisy because the hotel is old, so you could hear other guests taking showers, etc. They claim they will have tea and coffee in the morning, but they never had hot water for tea. There is no minibar so you can never take food back to your hotel to put in a fridge. Our toilet didn't flush right (it kept flushing for about 20 minutes). All in all, if this hotel was $70 a night, I would be raving, but for over $200, it's absolutely insane.

After our stay, I have to say it is 99.9% positive with only a few minor issues. Located just off the main intersection of Powell and Post, Kensington Park is in a great location. If you're a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, as my girlfriend is, you will absolutely adore this area of town, as the restaurant is on top of a Macy's building no more than 5 minutes walk away. There are many other restaurants within that area, and there is little doubt that if you do not find anything within the immediate area, you can find something just a few blocks away. The hotel is also a few minutes walk from many posh boutiques, Chinatown, the Financial District, as well as the famous Cable Cars. Public transit is also very accessible from this location, with Geary and Market St within walking distance as well, and was a very good base of operations for the time we spent in San Francisco, as we were mainly focusing on the Northern areas of the city (Bay/Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Chinatown, Japantown, Legion of Honor, Fisherman's Wharf, and Alcatraz). Getting to the hotel was a breeze. We simply (well, simply after finding the station) hopped on the BART, got off at Powell, and headed North to Post St. Due to the popularity of the area however, actually navigating Powell and making it up the hill with luggage in tow can be a bit of a challenge. I can't even begin to imagine the difficulties one would encounter should they have children along with them as well. It should also be noted that there are several homeless people along this route. However, they do not do anything that would cause a nuisance or disturb the peace. Once we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a very luxurious, old school classy, dark coloured lobby, completed with a piano, and several comfortable couches. Once check in was completed, we went to our room which was furnished with your typical hotel items, minus a fridge and cooking implements. Most important of all, the room was clean, which is something that is of importance to most people. In terms of the bed, it's difficult to quantify the level of comfort, as this is a person to person thing. I will say that the bed is a bit on the soft side, which may or may not be to your liking. Naturally, being in such a great city, we didn't spend much time in the hotel room, other than to sleep at night. Each time we came back, the rooms were tidied professionally, with any minor messes we made taken care of. The front desk staff were equally friendly and approachable, and were accommodating to the strange requests that I made of them. One final item of note is that light sleepers may want a room away from Post St, or perhaps consider a hotel not in this area at all. As luck would have it, Post is a one-way street, and just up the street is a San Francisco Fire Department depot, and because of our room, we could hear/see the trucks whiz by every single night. Despite being 7 floors up, there is still quite a lot of noise. Similarly, I'm guessing there is a Police Department or something in the area, as we heard those noises every night as well. All this boils down to the bottom line: would I stay here again? If the rating didn't quite spell it out for you, the answer is yes, assuming I'm doing stuff in this part of town, and I don't want to rent a car. Given the prices of all the other hotels in this area, Kensington Park offers one of the best combinations of location and price around.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel for a great price\u201d", "Author": "bubs75", "ReviewID": "UR15176234", "Content": "I did a lot of research prior to booking this hotel and read all of the reviews here.

It was adequate in size, considering we used it primarily for sleeping. The closet was large and there were plenty of other places to store our things. The bath was large for one, and two could share it without much problem. The main room had two other mirrors as alternatives for doing hair and makeup. A few nice, unexpected features were a refrig, a magnifying makeup mirror, flat screen tv on the wall, and a lamp with a plug in its base. We were told there is a/c; if there is, couldn't find it.

Stayed in downtown S.F for the first time ever. Chose Kensington Park Hotel after seeing a promotional ad on TV. Loved our stay there. Friendly helpful staff, free coffee/tea and juice in the mornings, free sherry and teas in late afternoon and early evening. Very comfortable feather bed mattress pads, fibron down pillows, the place is very clean and just put in flat screen TV's. Was very quiet inside the hotel halls etc. but lots of street noise etc. from outside most of the night, we were on the Post street side, 10th floor. Think you'd have that noise anywhere in a big city so bring ear plugs if you're not a sound sleeper. Less then a block from cable car route, Union Square, Borders, Disney store and more. Many great places to eat close by. Had a good breakfast at the Pinecrest Restrautant at 401 Geary (walking distance). Wonderfull dinner at the Millennium Restrauant (vegan) at 580 Geary (also walking distance), it is expensive $145.00 for the two of us, we each had a glass of wine.

The friendliness and warmth of the staff is half the reason why we chose the Kensington; the rest, of course, was the beauty and charm of the Royal Court Suite and the Sherwood Room. The Suite was enormous, lush, richly appointed, and extremely clean. It comfortably fit all 18 of our guests after dinner, and we loved that it had a huge sitting room, dining table, and 2 large bathrooms, both with shower/bath combos. We appreciated that the bedroom area had its own entrances/exits-- from the main entrance, you can enter either the bedroom or the sitting room area, and you can close off the bedroom from the sitting room as well. We also liked the kitchenette, although the mini-fridge wasn't that useful for keeping food/beverage items cold enough. The room was mainly quiet, except in the early mornings, when the garbage trucks (12 floors below us, but we still heard them quite clearly!) emptied dumpsters from nearby restaurants. The Sherwood Room is an intimate meeting space on the Mezzanine that we used for our wedding ceremony. It was perfect! The sales manager, who said we were the first to use the room for a wedding since she'd been around, gave us helpful suggestions and support preparing for decorations, room set-up, ceremony timing, etc. The whole event went off without a hitch. We couldn't have asked for a better site for our small wedding ceremony, and our friends were all very impressed by the gorgeous room and the helpful staff. As I said, the front desk staff were amazing-- always friendly, helpful, going out of their way to assist us with our guests and our wedding ceremony. The hotel was in close walking distance of a huge variety of restaurants, bars, shopping, theaters, and other entertainment (Ruby Skye!), as well as other hotels.

This relatively small hotel (70-80 rooms, I believe) was everything that my girlfriend and I hoped for. It is in a very convenient location (1/2 block from Union Square), and our room was clean, comfortable and well-appointed. We arrived on a Saturday morning, having taken BART from the San Francisco Airport to the Powell Street station. This was about a 4-5 block walk from the hotel, but as we had not packed too heavily, this was no problem. We got to the hotel around 11 a.m., expecting to simply check our bags for a few hours until our room would be ready. Imagine our pleasure when the desk clerk informed me our room was already cleaned and available. Our room was on the 10th floor of this 12-story hotel, which only has guest rooms on floors 6-12. I had read that rooms on the front of the hotel (Post St.) side tended to be too noisy, but we did not find this a problem. Yes, we did have a street musician down on the corner below us each evening, but they seemed to quit by 10-11 p.m., which was plenty early enough for us. Plus, they were all quite good! We were blessed with wonderful San Francisco weather. Days were in the high 70s and nights in the low 60s. Really could not have asked for any better. I had done a lot of research ahead of time, so had a pretty good idea of where we wanted to go while we were there and how to get there, but the staff at the front desk were always very eager to answer any questions and help with any request I had. Very friendly and responsive. Being a small hotel, they do not have on-site housekeeping or food service. The housekeeping was never an issue, as rooms were cleaned by the staff that comes in each day, and any needs we had after hours were quickly handled by the bell staff or desk staff. And, with so many fantastic restaurants in SF, we certainly didn't come there with the intention of eating room service meals. The hotel has an arrangement with a Cafe a few doors down for continental breakfast service. You get a voucher at the front desk and go down the street for tea or coffee, muffin or danish. We didn't expect much from this service, and we didn't get much, either. Not a very impressive selection or service at this Cafe. The hotel's 2nd and 3rd floors house the Post St. Theatre, a quaint little theatre with not a bad seat in the house. We saw \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,\" a play I was not familiar with ahead of time, but highly entertaining. Good music, great performances by the characters, and just a very fun, cute show. We got tickets the morning of the show at the TIX booth on Union square for less than $30 each. Well worth it, but hurry, it closes in early September. I would love to see another show in this theatre, and if you're staying in the hotel, you certainly can't beat the ease of the drive home after the show. The hotel is in a great location. Having been to San Francisco a few times, I really enjoy staying around Union Square better than any other location. With the 3-day passports we got for public transportation, we could take any of the cable cars, streetcars, buses or subway trains for no additional cost. Best $18 I ever spent in SF, and we felt we could get anywhere we wanted to within the city by starting within steps of our hotel. With all the great shopping, eating and people-watching we love to do in the Union Square area, this hotel was a great choice for us.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSurprised!\u201d", "Author": "BigJHD", "ReviewID": "UR5540120", "Content": "I stay in San Francisco for business quite often but usually at one of the Hyatt's or Hiltons.

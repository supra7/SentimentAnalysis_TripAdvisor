I dont care what anyone says, but $149+tax for 7 nights stay anywhere is awesome..as long as you like it, It is super duper close to Disney World and right off the major freeway and highway. House cleaning is only done once a week tho and you must empty your own trash. this is just fine for me because i not like random housekeepers coming into my \"private\" room each morning to clean.I never see anyone \"hanging out\" (even late at night) and i am never awakened with loud people or noises. I like to stay on the top floor and love the fact there is a full refrigerator and microwave. but remember, this is a no frills weekly and people make this their home, so for larger families?? Only bummer i would say is that there is no daily housekeeping and it might get messy for you, but greatttttt way to save money for other things you want to do while you are in town!

It was filled up with dirt and dead plants. we packed everything and decided it was ust better to go and lose all our money rather than continue to live this nightmare. luckily, kathy was working the desk that evening, and she apologized for all inconveniences, and offered to call the general manager. he was corteous enough to charge us for the three nights we stayed and refund the deposit and the rest of my money. they were kind enough to offer us to stay at teh other home suite home but we wouldnt want to stay anywhere near this company. the rude front desk girl should not be in the hospitality business she is terrible. i work for a hotel and if i ever treated a customer like that i would be out of a job.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cBeyond the worst motel ever\u201d", "Author": "sarah2570", "ReviewID": "UR55667796", "Content": "It was my birthday weekend. thinking I was going to Kissimmee for a nice get away.was I in for a surpise.the motel was so gross and dirty. and you better bring your own laundry soap and bathroom tissue,because they dont give you any there.and be ready to make your own bed,because they dont do that either.

I have never had to wait very long for a service call. We have two beds along with a full size fridge/freezer. The microwaves could be updated. The children who stay here seem to be very well behaved. Security at night is handled by a guy named CJ and he takes his job serious so I sleep well at night. The only disadvantance is the front desk staff and management. They are often rude and provide answers that change from day to day. The other Home Suite Home has offered having small pets and I wish this one would so that a lot of people who have pets can bring them along also.

In five years Home Suite Home has managed to turn it into a roach motel. We arrived after midnight and didn't get a good look at the place until morning, needless to say we left that morning. There is not enough space here to list everything that was wrong with this hotel but the highlights include a hole in the wall where you could see into the next room, windows that wouldn't shut, dirt everywhere, you are given one roll of toilet paper for the week, no hair dryer, you have to wash your own towels, maid service is only once a week, I could go on and on. When I asked them if they had any other rooms I was told that was their best room.

It was a mile down the road in what seemed to be a safe area and looked more upscale with fountain, pool, hot tub and tennis courts. We are not picky by any means about hotels and are not accustomed to the lack of luxury, but this hotel had serious problems. First of all, the lady at the front desk was extremely cold and rude and silent when you asked her questions. We started to wonder if she was hard of hearing. Second, our room had roaches, excessive mildew on the shower curtain (not just one or two spots) a musty odor and dirty carpets. It was not clean at all and wallpaper was peeling off of the bathroom walls. The elevator was smelly and filthy. The pool was not heated and very COLD... and the hot tub was small and not heated well either. My family and I were disappointed, especially since we paid the same price as our other hotel and found the place so lacking... When we told the front desk lady in a polite manner about the roaches and mildew upon check-out, she didn't say one word. Didn't even acknowledge what we said. Someone who was staying at the hotel told us it has been bought by new owners... hopefully they will make some very necessary changes.

We get into this room, well..........it has burnt out lights, moldy shower curtain, filthy air filter and BUGS!!!!! We complained multiple times!!! The maint. man took a shower curtain from the room next to us, along with one of their lightbulbs, I had to change the shower curtain because the maids did not pay attention to the complaint that was put in about the moldy shower curtain. We were told we could talk to the Night Auditor as there was not a manager available, this night auditor comes in at 11:30 pm and was to be there until 1pm (as told to us by the front desk) well, we went down at 7am but it was so busy we were not abel to talk to him, we are on vacation and should not have to wait around and waste our time, subsequesntly we never were able to voice our disgust to the right person. We had much more happen to us but I have not the time to write a novel just now. Unfortunately I prepaid for this hotel, otherwise I would have left this dump at high velocity. NOW to make matters worse I have been charged YET AGAIN!!! I called to fix this error only to be put on hold for 11 minutes (long distance) to be told to call back on Monday!!!! There is a hurricane coming which is to hit Tampa Bay, I was told that they were more concerned with this hurricane as it was their priority. Now, I am calling Orlando, it is not even 8am, the hurricane is to hit Tampa Bay sometime in the afternoon....why can I not be helped until Monday? Most infuriating!!!!!

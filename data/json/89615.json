It was great being able to choose what type of wood you wanted from the menu--the Butler recommended the Taj Blend which was a little bit of everything--just lovely. The hotel was quiet and comfortable and was in an ideal location. Directly across from the park, Beacon Hill and plenty of shopping around. Molten Brown amenities were lovely and the bed linens, and towels were soft and comfortable We did have room service once and the food was hot and delivered quickly--not always the case in many hotels. Brunch in the Cafe was excellent--staff fell over themselves to make sure we were satisfied. Some of the furniture was a bit dated, but the room was very clean.

No such luck. Typically not a problem but we had so many bags and we were just so exhausted from the day when we arrived to the hotel. We got in our room and the first thing we noticed was how outdated the rooms were and strangely the furniture was placed. The TV was placed to the left of the bed, not centered. The shower had shower curtains instead of doors so that instantly grossed out the hubby. Since we were so tired, we looked out the window (fantastic view of the park) and then went to sleep In the morning, we noticed that the water in the tub was not draining and the TV was not working. We called the front desk - they said that they would send an engineer over right away - no one ever came. When we complained to the manager, she said that they would definitely look into it for the next guest. What about us? It wasn't as relaxing as we hoped, not worth the money, and definitely does not live up to the Taj name.

The last few times we have stayed there I have said this one will be the last, the rooms are just getting too funky but the outstanding price and location keeps luring us back. I'm from Boston and I can say with confidence this is the best location in the city. As far as prices go, the last time we stayed here our room was $250 and we got a large suite overlooking the public garden; that kind of price just doesn't exist anywhere else (although the Eliot Hotel is also very reasonable and nice, sans the view). Those are the goods, here come the bads and they're pretty bad. The couch in our room had nasty stains all over it, I tried to turn the cushions but the other sides were stained also. It was so bad I was afraid to sit on it so I had to put towels on it. Even though our suite was large, there was only a sofa and one chair for furniture in the parlor area. When we got rooms service we didn't have two chairs to sit at, which was really awkward because the sofa was low and, as mentioned, not someplace where I wanted to sit. The carpeting was also stained and I'm not talking about small stains.The bedroom was fine, if a little small and chilly (the rooms seem to have forced heat and our bedroom never felt warm) and the bathroom was also fine, nothing special (though Molton Brown products are always nice). Just outside of our room there was a large section of the wall that was water damaged and all the wallpaper was peeled off, it was nasty. I guess in the end, my feeling is I would rather pay more for a nicer property. (PS: Service is very good, particularly valet, but one night we came back to our room and there were four people in there, which was a little unsettling. When we asked what they were all doing we were told they were bringing us our amenity--two thanksgiving cupcakes--why did this take four people??

Mercedes, the lady in charge there, was also very warm and welcoming. I had ordered room service for dinner one night, and the meal portions were tasty, huge and fairly reasonably priced. Finally, last but most importantly, the hotel has one of the best locations in the city, at the beginning of Newbury St., which is one of the main shopping and restaurant streets in downtown Boston.

That said, we spent a very enjoyable six nights At the Taj Boston (Business and Pleasure). The hotel is the former Ritz and lives up to the elegance of a Ritz and now Taj reputation. Boston has many areas so it is hard to say what is the best. It all depends on what you are looking to do. The Taj is in Back Bay, overlooking the Public Gardens and the Commons. Great location for shopping and business. It is on the corner of Newbury Street which has some great shopping and galleries. It is walkable to the business center and walkable to the waterfront/North Bay on a nice day or a short cab ride. The Taj is what you expect from an older, traditionial hotel. Excellent service and staff (although the reception area was always a bit of a cluster) with lots of friendly, efficient, and helpful staff. Room service was quick and the food was hot, and The Bar was comfortable and relaxing after meetings and shopping. We had a room with a park view. It was amazing with the fall colors. I highly recommend requesting a park view. An associate was there and had an air conditioner view. The view definitely added to the experience. The bedroom was fairly large for an old hotel. A pleasant surprise was the lighting in the room. One of my biggest complaints is the lighting in most hotels is not bright enough to work. The room was very bright. The two downsides were the small size of the bath room and the lack of outlets near the desk. The bathroom was tiny! Older hotels have small bathrooms, but this was one of the smallest I have had in quite some time. You could not fit more than one person in at a time, truly tiny. On the plugs, in todays world of lap top, mobile phones, iPads, etc, we need outlets. There were only two near the desk without unpluging a light. While these were inconveniences, they are not deal breakers and wouldn't prevent me from staying there. My only complaint would be some of the wear and tear. The carpet was filthy and stained, and the comforter and sheets were torn. You expect wear and tear at all hotels, but I do expect a higher standard at the Tag.

I then called the front desk on my way there and a very helpful front desk staff moved our room right away to one of the suites with a fireplace. This made me happy, although I had wished they had not made the initial mistake. When I arrived at the hotel and pulled up in front no one came over to help me with my bags or to move my car, so I pulled out my own bags and moved toward the door and finally the bell hop came and gave me a claim ticket but did not ask to help me with my things. I do have to say I expect a bit more service at this caliber hotel. When I arrived we had a fire in the fireplace and I found the room very clean, the carpet comment from a previous reviewer is on target as they did seem a bit worn. The furniture was nice and the bed very comfortable. I do wish there was a fan in the bathroom as the mirror quite fogged up after my shower. Yes, as another reviewer noted, the drain could not handle the lovely shower head as it did back up a bit. We were only there one night so I cannot speak to housekeeping but they did have nice robes, towels and toiletries. The next morning on my way to the Cafe for breakfast I dropped my valet tag with someone from the front desk. I told him I was grabbing a bite to eat and would be done in less than 30 mins. He told me my car would be out front waiting for me. This was busy but not overly hectic Friday morning, so when I got outside and found out that there was no car and no knowledge of getting my request 30 mins earlier, I was not impressed with the staff's ability to follow-through. I ended having to wait another 10 mins to get my car and when the valet showed up with it he was very apologetic but also did not offer to help with my bags, he only did so after I asked if he could grab them off the luggage carrier.

The street is busy and loud and I woke up about 5 times during the night as a result. 2. The service has mixed, but crucially flawed in dealing with complaints. I called down for my car, was told it would be up in 10-15 minutes, and waited 40 minutes (counted it on my clock). As a result, I was late to the meeting I flew out to Boston for. The valet management and hotel management was extremely unapologetic and quite frankly judgmental. Never apologized once, never offered to comp the valet. My company paid for the trip, but I don't care. I have worked in 4 diamond resorts and customer service is key. Really poor. 3. The food is really mixed. I love their breakfast, but their desserts in the bar with absolute garbage. I love desserts, my bar is really low, and I couldn't stomach either their Opera Cake or Boston Creme Pie.

We were told that they were \"preparing the room now.\" We went for a walk around Boston Common and returned at 4pm (having had no phone call) on the presumption that the room must surely be ready. We were told that our room still wasn't ready (apparently the manager was checking it)! We were not offered any refreshments or anywhere to sit whilst we waited. We made our way into the bar and, presuming that it would be a matter of minutes before we could get into our room and have a long awaited shower, we didn't bother to order drinks. 20 minutes later we were still sat there. By this point I was increasingly frustrated and returned to the reception desk to vent. Having made my opinion perfectly clear, they deigned to \"switch our room\" and we were given the room key. Bizarrely we were just handed the room keys with a card folder with the room number on - no explanation as to where our room was located or which direction to go. Once we had located our room we waited for our bags. After 5 minutes we had a telephone call from the bellboy asking how many bags we had - not reassuring! He eventually arrived about 20 minutes after we entered our room. This may all seem trivial but it created such a bad impression on our arrival and was so disappointing on the first day of our holiday. It really spoilt the hotel for me. The lobby is impressive, as are the hotel corridors. Our room was ok. The decor is quite dated but looks high quality. The bathroom had a shower over the bath, which was powerful, and Molton Brown toiletries. Our room overlooked Newbury Street - nice view and no problems with noise. There was a nightly turndown service with bottled water, small chocolates, slippers and weather forecasts provided. We visited the gym once, there were 4 treadmills, a couple of bike machines, some weight machines and a cross trainer. It was quite warm in there and relatively busy at 7am. There was a small fridge with bottled water and some fruit available. The location is great - right next to Boston Common. We managed to walk to most places we wanted to visit and there were plenty of restaurants close by. We would particularly recommend Epaluche as a nice restaurant to visit. The concierge was friendly and knowledgeable and made dinner reservations for us on a couple of occasions ( we had chosen restaurants ourselves). Overall the hotel itself is alright. We paid about \u00c2\u00a3200 per night, which seemed reasonable value given the superb location.

I'm 5'9\", so not exactly short, but I felt like I had to jump to get on this bed. I can only imagine the difficulty had by all the little old ladies who stay here (as evidenced by crowds in the lobby). Service: Not very good. I had difficulty with connecting to wifi, and nobody in the hotel had any clue what to do or with whom I should speak. I called the front desk for a wake-up call, but nobody answered, so I had to go to the front desk to get it. I went out with friends at night and didn't return to the hotel until about 2am - the front door was locked, and nobody answered the after-hours door bell, which I wrang for about 10 min. Finally, a janitor saw me and let me in. My wake-up call came 10 min early (not a big deal, but seriously?!!). On check out, I asked that my receipt be emailed to me (which virtually every hotel I stay at has no difficulty doing). The clerk took my email address and said he'd email it to me, but didn't get it until after I called the hotel several days later.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gdansk, Poland", "Title": "\u201ccould be nice years ago\u201d", "Author": "turysta78", "ReviewID": "UR118505563", "Content": "I spent three days in Taj Boston hotel this September.

He told me it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem and he would make a note of it on my reservation. When I checked in Sunday, August 1st, the front desk person first argued with me about directly billing the company I work for and then said she knew nothing about a refrigerator, a rollaway bed and a coffee maker for my room, but said she would have them sent up right away. I also requested a NY Times be delivered to my room each morning, which, I was told, also wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. The refrigerator and rollaway arrived right away, but I was given some story about only a limited number of coffee makers were allowed in the hotel because of the outlets. The a/c didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly and I asked the hotel to send somebody up to fix it, which they eventually did. I also asked for a couple of extra pillows, towels and a child size robe (which is advertised on their website.)

The a/c eventually malfunctioned again and gave the room a damp musty odor which was never fully removed by the time I checked out on August 12th (the third floor, where their Business Center is hidden, also has a damp musty odor.) When I finally complained to the Asst. GM, the NY Times arrived twice and then stopped coming and the coffee maker arrived with two packets of coffee (enough for two cups of coffee; when I asked for some creamer for the coffee, it was brought to my room and sullenly shoved at me.) Housekeeping removed the extra towels and never returned them, even though I again asked for extra towels.

We had all we required, personally I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like kettles ,cups and cartons of milk and sachets of sugar etc in the room, it reminds me too much of cheap motels so their absence was a positive...if anyone is that desperate for a fix of tea or coffee why can't they order from room service or even wander to a local Starbucks ? Wi-Fi reception was excellent and was about $10 per day which is slightly annoying but is all too typical and if you need it for business it is somewhat of an irrelevancy......and if you just want it for \"pleasure\" and are desperate to visit the ether then why not just tootle down to the coffee shop 100yds away and spend your days glued to a screen for free? The room fridge was well stocked and for this standard of hotel reasonably priced. Room service, maid and evening turn down was of the highest standard - 10 out of 10!

Now, the \"not so good\": As part of the FHR Program, we received an \"upgraded\" room, however the \"upgraded\" room was small, only large enough for a king bed & crib (room size has been mentioned in other reviews as well). While the room is furnished, the furnishings don't have any drawers where you can actually store clothing. The tables don't have drawers and there is an armoire, but the cabinet contains a large fridge and the 3 small drawers next to the fridge contain snacks, so there is NO place to unpack any clothing.

So, that's 4 personal electronic devices. We found ONE usable plug. No, that's not an exaggeration. Speaking of laptops, Internet is billed at $10.75 a day which is a COMPLETE money-grab and rip-off. You can stay at the Marriott or Holiday Inn for half the price and get free internet. For the price the Taj charges a night, they can throw in free Internet, but since their clientele can afford their prices, perhaps they think they can just charge for access? Finally, the \"complimentary continental breakfast\" I received through the FHR program wasn't complimentary. You HAD to order the continental breakfast to get it \"free\"; otherwise, you received a $16 breakfast credit. So, my pancakes and $6 orange juice (yes, $6 orange juice) + coffee = more than $16 which means that I ended up paying some cash for breakfast each morning. Once again, nickle & dimed.

I just couldn't find it and neither could housekeeping. Initially, they thought they might have thrown it away by mistake, they were quite apologetic. When I left, I called security at the hotel. The shoe bag, while having almost no commercial value was a very well made, old cloth felt bag passed down to me from my father. The security person treated this as if it was an heirloom diamond ring. After an exhaustive search of the room and \"key records\" to make sure it wasn't stolen, they found my shoe bag after they re-searched the room for the um-teenth time. This only happens at a hotel where the staff really take pride in their jobs. I travel a lot for business. By and large, I find it's not much fun. But This is one of my favorite all time hotels.

Well located and furnished, it's respectable, comfortable, and classy. So with high expectations come pickiness... but don't let the list of negatives put you off - it's a good hotel. The location is great if you need to be at that end of town, and it's a classic and well renovated building. I checked in just before midnight. There was nobody at the door, in the reception area, or at the reception desk. I had to call the house phone to find a receptionist. They came immediately and were polite and pleasant, but it was the first time I've walked into a five star hotel to an absent welcome. Ever. The room was large and comfortable. It looked over an interior courtyard, but having booked a cheap rate I had no complaint. The room was all you'd expect - good bed, long bath, good toiletries, sufficient working space. I'd have liked an ipod plug-in (there was a CD player), and bath salts for the bath would have been a nice touch. Nevertheless this was a classic five-star room. I slept well (overslept, in fact, which I hardly ever do!). Internet, which was fast and easy to connect to, was predictably expensive (and annoyingly your login works only for one device - you pay double if you want to use your smartphone, which is egregious). The workout room was clearly a converted accommodation suite. It had a good range of aerobic machines, good free weights, some resistance machines... all ok. The floor was carpeted, which always feels inappropriate in a gym (I'm sure the bacterial guest population would disagree). I had a very late breakfast in the cafe. The server was efficient, polite, and professional, maybe a lit aloof but then I was eating breakfast at lunchtime and this was Boston not northern California! The coffee upheld the most established traditions of American coffee (sorry, that was a European dig... ) but it kept coming and was fresh. The food was good as it should be at the price point and the ambience was pleasant. Checkout was excellent, with plenty of help with bags, friendly service, and help with directions; it redeemed the sad check-in nicely. As part of the Taj chain you'll see Indian specialities on the menu, and there were a few more Indian guests than you'd expect. Good to see Taj spreading its wings from its iconic Mumbai roots.

The Ritz was your properly aging grandmother; always comforting, always reminding you quietly to enjoy your stay in stately surroundings. But being New England, it was not grandiose, and with age came signs of slight fraying at the edges. That's probably why the Ritz group bailed on the infrastructure, chose to move to new digs across the garden and common, and see if what used to be referred to as the combat zone could be reinvigorated. Ah, the early and mid 2000s. So, along came Taj and chose to stick with the tried and true. I stayed for one night recently, at a very nice rate plan, and found the new owners to be loyal to the conservative vision. The service levels are up to Taj standards, there's been some cleaning and spiffing, but the Taj still reminds me of the old Ritz Carlton, and the new Ritz Carlton suggests a strange dream sequence.

I have stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past when it was the Ritz. It was a lovely hotel in a great location with impeccable service. The Taj chain has completely ruined one of the gems of Boston. Let's start with what was good. The hotel commands a great location right on the Public Garden - within easy walking distance of shopping in the Back Bay and all of the wonderful restaurants and small shops in Beacon Hill. Some of the lobby staff and room service personnel who pre-date the Taj takeover, are still as wonderful, helpful and gracious as always. I should also mention the bed was super comfy. What was wrong: We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon after a long day of driving. Check-in is at 3pm. We were told that our room was not ready and probably would not be ready for at least another hour, possibly longer. There were a number of people (many with small children) milling around the lobby (which is on the smallish size) who were in the same predicament. Apparently, the hotel had allowed a number of guests from the previous evening to utilize a late check out option - which is fine if you have the capacity to accommodate those folks as well as your new arrivals. Obviously, this was not the case. This was a huge inconvenience for us as we had dinner reservations with friends at 6pm and hoped to shower and freshen before going out. The hotel offered us NOTHING for this inconvenience. Not even a \"go have a drink in the bar, while we ready your room\". Nothing, zero! When we finally were allowed access to our room, it was clear that the room and bathroom had not been updated in 15 years or longer. The blackout coating on the curtains was peeling and completely gone in places so that with the drapes closed there were huge areas where the bright sunlight penetrated the curtains. The windows have not been re-glazed in 30-40 years and if you have a room facing the common it will be very noisy. The telephone system is very old and several times during the night our phone emitted a loud dial tone through the speaker - 1am, 3am and again at 5:30. It was horrible. They also charge $10.75 per day for internet access. There are many nice hotels in this area, which are much nicer and better value. I will not stay here again.

First the positives: (1) Great location, (2) nice property, (3) courteous valets and bell captains. Now the negatives: (1) service in room is substandard. With the maid service, they try to be cute and clever, and end up being annoying. For example, we arrived in the evening. By then the maid has placed chocolates in the room and left the radio on to \"tell us she had been there.\" We have seen this in other end high hotels as well. The problem is that each hotel has a different radio, and the radios are so complicated mere mortals can't figure out how to turn them off. As near as we could tell, we have to hit CTRL/ALT/Delete while simultaneously holding down F9, the Shift Key, and the letter Q. We just unplugged the radio after spending five minutes trying to figure how how to turn the it off. Quit trying to be cute and just leave the damn radio off. Another example: they close the drain the bath tub, but the tub design is so clever, there is no obvious way to open it, other than stick your hand in 3 inches of water and pry it out. Just leave the drain open. A third example: the designer marble bathrooms have pedestal sinks. It may look great it Architectural Digest, but don't the morons who design these rooms realize that travelers always have toiletry bags? A pedestal sink has no place to put the bag. Two travelers equals two bags. We could put one of the bags on top of the toilet tank, and then have it plop into the toilet. Lovely. Give us sinks with flat surfaces where we can put our stuff. Forth example: No plugs in the room. We travel with Blackberry's, computers, cell phones. If you don't have sufficient outlets, at least put a power strip in the room. Earth to management: design the hotel with travelers in mind. Skip the restaurant. We made the mistake of having breakfast there the last morning. The service was horrible.

We reserved a 1 Bedroom suite and asked for a rollaway for our daughter. On our arrival at the Hotel, we were greeted by a doorman who gave us a receipt for our car as well as our luggage. The front desk personnel were unkempt but polite and check in went smoothly until the bellman frantically began to ask us questions about our luggage. It seems he had some how given our bags to someone else and was trying to reconstruct what was and was not ours and where the bags may have ended up. Eventually they made their way to our room. The room was small, dusty and looked worn. The only portion that appeared to be up to grade was the small but well appointed bathroom. At 5:00am on our first morning our room phone rang. It was the front desk. the cheerful voice at the other end of the line said... \"Good Morning!, your Bellman is on his way up to your room!\". Super, I thought. Except that we were not expecting either a Bellman or a 5:00 am wake up call. The hotel itself seemed a bit rough around the edges and our room in particular lacked certain things you might expect from a Hotel of this type, clean floors for one. Second, we took a cushion off the armcair in our room after we had spilled some water on it only to find a huge blood stain on the other side of the cushion. Nice. On our second and last evening we heard a knock on our door at around 11:00 pm and were surprised to find a Hotel staffer waiting with some spray equipment and large rubber gloves on his hands. He asked;\"Did you call to have your room sprated?\" We had not. I have ko idea what he might be spraying for but I felt itchy until I got home to Chicago.

The experience was insulting and infuriating. The package I booked included a suite, dinner for two and breakfast for two, excluding tax, tip, and alcohol. When I checked out, the hotel had applied an $85 credit to my dinner bill and a $40 credit to my breakfast bill, and charged me for the remainder (about $205). When I complained, the woman at the front desk handed me a printed card explaining that the dinner for two could cost a maximum of $85 (on what planet was that going to happen?!) and the breakfast a maximum of $40. This card had the Taj and AmEx logos on it. I went back to my reservation e-mail and the AmEx and Taj websites. No mention of those limits. I called AmEx. They had never heard of the limits, and their reservations system indicated that the package included dinner and breakfast, less alcohol, tax and tip, just as the website indicated. I called the Taj to complain and, at their request, e-mailed them a screen shot of my reservation and the AmEx website, which reflected no limits. The Taj broke off communication with me at that point, and started to communicate directly with AmEx. They sent AmEx a fax (later shown to me by AmEx) claiming that I had received all benefits to which I was entitled--without mentioning the e-mail I had sent proving just the opposite. AmEx also told me that the Taj reported that I had been informed of the limits at check-in. That was an expedient lie. (And since when can the Taj change the terms of an offer AFTER you have booked it and shown up at check-in? The whole thing reeks of dishonesty and sharp practice.) Ultimately, AmEx credited me the difference, and apologized to me for the Taj's misconduct. The Taj has never apologized. As of today, the bogus offer is still on AmEx's website. One wonders how many people have been sucked in by this offer, then stiffed out of their free meals. (To be fair, the non-management employees were really great.

It was supposed to be a nice getaway for four girlfriends to celebrate a special birthday. We checked in to our rooms around 5:30 p.m. with plans to get ready for a special evening out. We had dinner reservations at 7 p.m. When we arrived in our rooms we found that the hotel had given us the wrong rooms. We had reserved two rooms with two queen beds in each. Instead our rooms each had one king. We called the front desk to let them know of the mistake and they said there were no other rooms available and there was nothing else they could do. We insisted that they find an alternative for us. The man at the front desk told me he was the manager and asked me to give him 5 minutes and he said he would call back. He did not call back for 10 min. I finally called him back. At that point he said again there was nothing he could do. Again - we insisted that he make some sort of adjustment for the mistake. He said he was busy and could I call back later??? To make a long story short - he eventually offered us two suites that still each only had king beds. We decided to take the option even though what we really wanted was the two beds in each room which we had reserved. We moved all of our luggage up to the 16th floor with no offer of help from the front desk. Upon arriving in our new rooms, we discovered that one of the suites only had a full-sized bed not a king or even a queen. So now we were worse off than before. We called the front desk and explained the situation and asked to go back to our old rooms where at least if we had to share beds, they were king size beds...and not full-sized. We were told that those rooms were no longer available. At this point, we were already late for our dinner reservation and had not had time to shower and change as we had planned. We complained to the guy who originally said he was the manager.\" He had the real manager call us back and this guy was no better. Instead of being apologetic and polite, he was very curt and not apologetic in the least. He asked us to explain the situation once again and had to nerve to admonish us for speaking quickly on the phone as we were rushing to try to make our dinner reservation. When I explained that the situation was making us late for dinner, the manager said I don't see how this bedding issue has anything to do with your lack of preparedness time!!!! Again I explained that we had been moving between rooms and have been on the phone with his staff for the past hour. At this point, we were about to loose our dinner reservation. We were already quite late. The hotel was quickly ruining a 40th birthday celebration for four moms who rarely have the opportunity to get away for an evening. Ultimately, the manager came up with another room that had a king bed so we had to move rooms yet another time. When it was all said and done - we were in FIVE different rooms. The hotel never apologized. The manager was very snooty and rude. To make matters worse, they charged my credit card with an additional $600 to cover any expenses that might have been incurred???? I called to question this and the hotel said they standardly run a $150 charge on a guest's card to cover any additional costs and that they then refund the charge if not used. In my case, they charged $150 X 4 -- four times for a total of $600. This did not need to be a disastrous stay. All it would have taken would have been a little competency from the guy at the front desk who claimed to be the manager and some level of customer service from the real manager who had quite an attitude.

Overlooking the Public Garden and Boston Common, this hotel remains the very foundation for luxury hotels in America and around the world. To learn more about this legendary hotel, visit http://corporate.ritzcarlton.com/en/About/OurHistory.htm. My last visit to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153then\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ritz Carlton was February 1982 when I was transferred by my company to the west coast and I had no opportunity to return to Bean Town until after the Big Dig was completed. My personal acquaintance with this hotel began in the fall of 1976 when I treated myself to supper in \"The Cafe\" as a reward for having recently graduated from college and arrived in Boston to begin my professional career. Here I was welcomed and treated as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gentleman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and over the next few years I continued the tradition of having supper on Friday evenings in The Cafe. After a few weeks I am certain curiosity got the best of the hotel manager and he was curious as to why a scrawny kid was having dinner in his restaurant. Certainly I did not fit the mold as to who was a Ritz Carlton guest. It was certainly evident I did not earn my money the old fashioned way, by inheriting it. Finally one evening the hotel manager approached my table; he introduced himself and welcomed me to his hotel. As it turned Mr. Bennett, the General Manager, grew up not more than thirty miles from where I spent my youth and we had attended the same college, and needless to say, we developed a bond and from that point on I was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somebody\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I entered the Ritz and Mr. Bennett knew how to put on the Ritz. James V. Bennett was the quintessential hotelier of his day. He lived and breathed ever y moment of his waking hours in this hotel. After all, he lived in an apartment on top of the hotel and could be seen at any time visiting with staff and inspecting the hotel. Jim always appeared in a smartly tailored Brooks Brothers suit, a fresh boutonniere in his lapel, a crisp white shirt, conservative silk tie, shined shoes, and manicured hands warmly and genuinely greeted his guests by name. In those rare times Mr. Bennett was assisted by the impeccably coiffured Miss. Eleanor O'Niel who knew the likes and dislikes of every hotel guest and had their preferences and personal telephone number committed to her memory. Eleanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister, Ruth, just happened to Mr. Yawkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary, owner of the Boston Red Sox. While Jim and Eleanor were conservative and formal, Ruth was at the other end of the spectrum, full of spirit and knew every statistic of every Red Sox ball player in her day by heart. She referred to the ball players as her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For the sake of disclosure, I became a regular to The Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and often I was invited to join Mr. Bennett, Eleanor and Ruth O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Niel for Friday supper. On occasion during the summer months Ruth would reach into her handbag and ask me if I could make use of some tickets, tickets that just happened to be along the third base line at the legendary Fenway Park. But I can assure you these tickets did not sway my opinion of this hotel. In those early days of my love affair with this grand hotel, one could not help notice nearly every staff member wore a pair of white gloves and the elevators were operated by staff. The elevators had little needlepoint upholstered benches so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ladies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be comfortable while traveling in the elevators. Fresh flowers were ever present, the brass and marble floors were highly polished and one could use either as a mirror. The table linens were crisp, tables immaculately set, and silver sparkled as if you were the first person to ever touch the flatware. The menus were professionally printed daily. And when you paid your hand-calligraphied guest check or room bill, your change was always new crisp, clean uncirculated bills and coinage. Back then the food was classic French, paying homage to the founder of Ritz Hotels, the incomparable Cesar Ritz and his business partner, legendary Chef Auguste Escoffier. One lesson Mr. Bennett instilled in me was his basic rule of quality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdYou can judge a hotel by its croissants at breakfast and the pate at dinner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It took some time; but, I now know what he meant and that rule remains applicable in my book. So what was different 28 year later? Not much. As I noted, I had not been back into this hotel for over two decades. I was aware the hotel had been closed and totally renovated. The heads at Marriott Hotels, made the decision to open a new shinny glass and more contemporary Ritz Carlton on the opposite side of the Boston Commons, in the middle of what was once known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Combat Zone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a rather unsavory area in Boston for many years. For several years both Ritz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-existed. Then a couple of years ago India based Taj Hotels expanded into America with the purchase of 17 Arlington Street. The lions head and cobalt blue entrusted to Ritz Carlton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity was erased. Ironically, the Taj Hotel Boston remains true to the original Ritz Carlton ideals, even more so than today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ritz Carlton Hotels. Call me old fashioned; but, I really enjoy the standards and traditions of elegant older hotels than many of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superficial polished chrome and glass hotels. The Taj Hotel Boston remains a wonderful experience. Times and economics have forced change upon this Grande Dame, just like every other hotel in America and most of the world, but at this hotel it was not very distinguishable. I was saddened to discover the regal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dining Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the second floor was now used as a ballroom. I understand dining requirements have changed along with demand; but, nevertheless, generations will never have the experience of servers in white ties and tails swirling around this elegant space capped off with its sparkling crystal chandeliers with cobalt blue decorations. As sad as it was to see this space no longer used for dinner, I was delighted to see the elegance of afternoon tea in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Lounge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd remains to this day. If one is not staying at the Taj, one should make every effort to indulge in afternoon tea. The accommodations were lovely. Though renovated just several years ago, the treatment reminded me of my stays back in the 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The crystal chandeliers in the corridors sparkled. The Frette bed linens and terrycloth bath lines were scrumptious. There was certainly no cutback or savings when it came to all the amenities offered in the bathroom. Even small packets of Woolite were on hand in case you needed to hand-launder your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delicates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the privacy of your room. Turn down was wonderful, complete with a linen floor mat so your bare feet did not have to touch the deep pile carpet before slipping into your Taj terrycloth slippers. The housekeepers were elegantly attired in classic black dresses with crisp white aprons. Even the housekeepers dressed for evening at this hotel. The only concern I would address is the lack of attentiveness of the staff in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To be greeted at the door, seated and then forgotten, is not what Cesar Ritz or Jim Bennett would have ever tolerated. And I did not like, as well. The bottom line is simply this, at least once in your life you should treat yourself to a stay at the Taj Hotel Boston. I dare say you might want to experience this classic hotel sooner than later so that you can be a more informed judge as to what quality and service represents in a luxury hotel.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bourne, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cHigh priced, Clean, Friendly, And Great staff and Location\u201d", "Author": "summerloved", "ReviewID": "UR55133039", "Content": "i recently stayed at the Taj located on newbury street and loved it! from the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the vallet attendents to the looby staff and maids, the glits and glammer was all over, it cathes your eye. the hotel is big with only 15 floors and a roof-top garden, a beautiful state of the art fitness center and a Chanel store located in the lobby!! the rooms were nice too with a HUGE bathroom and great beds. overalll. the hotel was Suberb and Serine", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201crooms are clean and elegant\u201d", "Author": "pcjunky", "ReviewID": "UR50136546", "Content": "rooms are very clean, nice bedding, friendly staff, great location. no coffee maker in the room, valet parking is $42 for overnight.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cUnforgetable great stay and service.\u201d", "Author": "Timco", "ReviewID": "UR49139466", "Content": "Location, Service, Everything is top noch What you expect from Luxury Hotel, Taj shows that they are in competition with other Top brands in the area,", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trumbull, CT", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable service and amazing location!

The concierge was very friendly and knowledgable and offered great tips. The room itself was truly amazing. I seriously thought we must have mistakenly be given a suite. (which was great since we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday!) There was a huge four poster bed and a beautiful antique style living room set. (big couch, chair, coffee table and desk.) The bathroom featured a huge garden style tub and had a large seperate room with a sink and vanity area.They have a pillow delivery service where you can pick the style of pillow you want (free of charge!) This location is truly to die for, too. We walked EVERYWHERE in no time at all! (to a Red Sox game, to the start of the freedom trail, to the Cheers bar--which is about a block away--to amazing shopping, even to the start of our Duck Tour.) The best part is that the hotel is behind the park, right where the swan boats are. So you are right by everything but you still have a nice view of trees and don't have the feeling that you're just surrounded by corporations. The hotel is a little pricey but not that much more than other hotels in the area. If you want to splurge a little and go all out on a trip to Boston, I would highly recommend doing it at the Taj!

So, I don't know what the hotel restaurant is like. However, we did order late night room service once, and it was solid. Hard to complain about 24 hr room service, since it's getting harder and harder to come by. The mini-bar could have been stocked with more boutique snacks and liquor, but that's pretty minor.

There were 4 of us and we had requested two beds rather than one king. They couldn't accomodate this request and said the only way we could get 2 beds was to pay an extra $50, which we did because we really had no choice. Check in process seemed to take a lot longer than I've experienced at other hotels, probably about 15 minutes at the counter, I'm not really sure why (there was no line). Room was very nice and large. Bathroom was large with double sinks, and the toilet and shower were sectioned off with a door that closed, which was nice since there was 4 of us getting ready. View was okay, nothing spectacular. We were on the 5th floor. Bed comfort was okay, nothing great, I think the beds at the Marriott are MUCH more comfortable. Room got very stuffy at night, we put on the AC in the middle of the night to sleep better, although the AC was slightly louder than I would have expected. We ordered room service at night and I'm pretty sure they didn't knock, as we waited forever, finally called down, and they told us they attempted to deliver with no answer. The food was on a cart outside the room, cold as ice. It was unfortunate, especially for the outrageous room service price, and I was suprised they did nothing to at least partially compensate us. Not even an apology. When trying to get a cab, the doorman pretty much ignored us, which surprised us. A couple came out of the hotel for a cab about 10 minutes after we had started trying for one, and the doorman got them right in a cab. Not sure if it's because they were dressed for dinner while we had on jeans, but regardless, don't judge a book by it's cover, we were going to a concert, of course we weren't dressed up. We still paid to stay at the Taj. Check out went faster, and our car was brought by the valet in about 15 minutes (we called ahead and it was waiting for us outside). Valet price is $42, which seems average for what you'd pay for valet anywhere else in the city Overall, we had a decent time. Hotel is very nice, and with better service I would have rated it better overall. They can't say they're a 5 star without a MAJOR improvement on service, from the front desk to the doorman to room service.

I had stayed here many years ago when it was the Ritz Carlton, and I am pleased to say the experience still measures up to that time...even though it is now a Taj hotel. The good things about the hotel include: 1. The location. It is right on Boston Common. It is a quick trip to get just about anywhere, from Copley, to Fenway, to the airport. All only minutes away. 2. Very well appointed. The common areas and the rooms are, as you'd expect, very well styled and appointed. You won't be wanting for anything. For instance, you get plush robes, slippers and free bottled water in your room. There is also a very fast wi-fi connection and a ton of cable channels for those looking for electronic entertainment. 3. Great service. Lots of \"my pleasures\" and \"how can I help you\"s at this hotel. We didn't have to lift a finger to do just about anything. Our bags were unloaded from our car and delivered to our room while we were checking in. Room service was available 24/7, which was handy given we arrived from the West Coast at midnight. But not all was perfect: 1. The rooms are very tiny. This hotel was built over 100 years ago, when people were apparently a lot smaller. The room was maybe 15' x 15', and felt like a small guest bedroom...made worse by the fact that a lot of furniture was crammed in that small space. And, the bathrooms are so small that you have to close the door before you can get to the toilet. So, don't think you're getting a spacious retreat. 2. The rooms are also quite dark. Our room only had one small window, which they made appear larger by draping it with window treatments three times the width of the window. Decorator trick, apparently. In any case, not much light came into the room, which made the room seem even smaller. 3. Parking is a bit cumbersome. They have a valet service, but they must park the car quite some distance away as they ask you to call for it 30 minutes before you need it. And, believe me, it takes at least 30 minutes for the car to come. 4. Restaurant on site was over-priced and had a disappointing (and overly eclectic) menu. 5.

When they screwed up my room (they gave me a room that hadn't been properly cleaned yet) they gave me a triple upgrade to a large suite, which was nice. Location is excellent, being right next to Boston's Public Gardens and on Newbury Street. Check-in was pretty efficient,. The room itself was huge, but that was due to being upgraded. The room I got when I first arrived was pretty normal ... I'd say a good size for a business person or a couple traveling to Boston. Quality of furnishings, beddding, etc. was all excellent, exactly what you'd expect visiting a luxury hotel. Toiletries were all Molton Brown and included nice touches like a shaving kit, toothbrush kit, etc. Room service was excellent. I ordered breakfast and it was at my door in less than 10 minutes. I've never had service that fast before. I took me by surprise. There was plenty of free bottled water, which I appreciated since it was kind of dry with the a/c on. The fitness center was pretty well appointed. Lots of cardio machines. The only minor complaint was that there wasn't much in the way of free weights or universal machines. But very nice and new nonetheless. Internet is the standard affair ... they charge $11 per day or so, which is normal at hotels like this. Did I say the room was huge? I had a sitting room, walk-in closet, bedroom with enough space to have a party. Good-sized bathroom. And an entry way that almost qualified as a foyer. In fact, when traveling I like smaller rooms because they I don't miss anything when I pack up to go. But it was a fun novelty to stay in a big suite like that. The only potential complaint with the room is that there was HVAC equipment nearby that made a humming noise if you stopped and listened. I'm a heavy sleeper so didn't bother me, but for some it could be an issue. Price paid was an excellent value ... I think I paid a little over $200 for a basic level room.

The hotel was very accommodating by setting us up with a microwave, fridge and DVD player at no extra charge making it very convenient to travel with a young child. What impressed us most, having checked in late, we realized we didn't have milk for our son for bed time. We took a chance and asked the restaurant for a cup of milk; they pleasantly provided us the milk and did not charge for it. Traveling with a child, we booked a room with two double beds. The room and bathroom was spacious and clean and overlooked the Commonwealth with a partial view of the Public Garden. The hotel supplied bottled water and chocolates with turn down service. Umbrella's are available and can be found either in the room or with the door man. In addition, the hotel had a stroller available; this came in handy during the Freedom Trail walk.

Like a snuggly throw blanket. The towels. Huge, fluffy bath sheets and plenty of them! Views of the Public Gardens from the club lounge Doormen and concierge became friendlier and friendlier during our stay What I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t love: My junior suite bedroom shared a wall with the elevator shaft. Room service took over an hour and the clam chowder made me sick (Boston has so much good food nearby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c skip room service) Nothing special to welcome children like the Ritz has always done At first I was a little irritated with The Taj, but after a five day stay, I fell in love with the hotel just as much as I fell in love with Boston. My room was a disappointment and traveling with a three-year old, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hassle with a change. I booked a junior suite on the club level and got a beautifully appointed room BUT it was next to the elevator shaft on the floor BELOW the club level (defeats the convenience of the lounge!) Unless you fall asleep instantly, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book this room because the elevator noise will ruin your night. Also, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the tranquil garden view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a look of windows and walls between the red brick buildings.

Also, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the fence about staying on the club level and you have small children, skip it. Children were tolerated, but unwelcome in the lounge. We made our trips to the club lounge for cheerios and cookies very short. Also, the drink setup is not typical Ritz indulgence as concierge staff serves you making you wait a bit for champagne or water or whatever. I saw some people leave after waiting too long for a cocktail. While the club food looked good and was plentiful, I preferred eating out for local crab cakes, lobster rolls, cod and chowders. Boston is such a delicious locale that the desire to eat on the club level was not the same as other destinations. But I still believe club access is a good value and nice splurge if you partake in cocktails. The location and building is the best and among the most beautiful in the city, but I think the Four Seasons might be a nice alternative and also the Fairmont Copley Plaza. If you have a view of the Public Gardens and appreciate the historic value of the Taj, I think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enjoy it! What a treasure Boston is.

I travel quite frequently, so I know what constitutes a good hotel, and this one was great! Pros: LOCATION: it is right smack dab in the middle of the action at downtown Boston. It is directly across the street from the beautiful Boston Gardens/Commons Area. The surrounding streets are littered with shopping, fine restaurants, beautiful architecture. The original Cheers is a 5 minute walk. SERVICE: from arrival to departure the service is top notch! ARCHITECTURE/ROOMS: the building itself is beautiful, and the rooms are also very beautiful and well appointed. The bathrooms are tastefully done in Marble. Be sure to ask for a room that faces the Boston Gardens/Commons park area. It is absolutely magnificent. THE CITY: Boston is a wonderful city. This was my first trip there, and you can explore all of downtown Boston from this hotel. It is all within walking distance. Even the harbors/marinas are only a 30-45 minute walk. The city is beautiful, clean, safe. I even rode their subways at midnight with NO Safety Concerns! Cons: THE PRICE: I stayed here on business, so I was not paying for the Hotel, but it is rather pricey. But you get what you pay for. As noted above, it has many things going for it in regards to Pros, so if you want to experience the beauty and history of downtown Boston, then book this hotel. It will be worth the price. THE TV: although a relatively minor concern, in a fancy hotel like this one would expect the tv's to be a little more upscale, ie...flatscreens, lcd, plasma, etc.....but they are the good old big tube 20-24 inchers.

She just said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I asked if she could find out how long the generator would be running. She put me on hold and then came back with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153three hours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was no suggestion about how she could make my situation better. I asked to speak with a manager and to be moved to another room. I was moved (to a much nicer, larger room on the common side of the hotel). When I checked out, nobody asked how my stay was and I received no compensation for the disruption. Overall, I was NOT impressed with this hotel. What kind of hotel operator runs a generator in front of the hotel for 4 hours during the night? This felt like an incredibly poorly run hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c certainly not 4-5 star level service.

I had heard wonderful things about the Taj chain and was excited to stay here. What a disappointment. We paid extra to assure a room with two double beds. Upon checking in at 4:30 in the afternoon, we were told that no double rooms were available. We were forced to wait in the lobby for over a half an hour while they found a room for us (even though the desk staff told us it would only be five minutes). Even though there was a bellman just hanging around the lobby, no one could be bothered to help with luggage. While the room was spacious, the bathroom definitely needed some attention, seeing as there was mold growing in the shower and along the floor. There are much nicer, cleaner and less expensive hotels in Boston that provide exceptional and courteous service.

Having read a few negative reports about this hotel (formerly the Ritz -Carton) I was pleasantly surprised. The accomodations of a standard room king bed where very large - definitly over 360 ' sq. The bed needed a step stool to get into it, and although my room was without a view of the Boston Commons it was very comfrotable. The service at the hotel was impeccable with very friendly accomodating staff. The location is amazing as you step out onto Newbury Street, he swan lake in the Boston Commons, a subway stop a block away, fantastic restaurants, pubs, shopping. I would reccomend that if you stay, you make sure that a refurbished room is available. The new managemanet is beginning its update of the hotel which is a little tired looking at the moment. I found the price of 326 a night on par for a major convention city. The negatives - the lack of seating in the lobby....you cannot sit and read a paper. The bar is very lovely and tends toward an older trendy crowd. The business center has only two computers - rather small. This is a great hotel for older travelers, business travelers.

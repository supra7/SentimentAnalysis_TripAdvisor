When I booked our reservation, I requested a higher floor and NO pet room. Both of my requests were honored with no problem. We were on the 15th floor in a room with 2 double beds, a sleep sofa, fridge and microwave, table and chairs, two dressers and a bathroom. The first thing I noticed when I opened the door to the room was the smell...........it smelled CLEAN! Very clean, and very pleasant. Everything in the room was fresh and clean, the carpets weren't worn anywhere, and were vaccumed everywhere. The carpeting was dark blue, so any misses or lint would have shown immediately. There were no stains visible either. The beds were clean and crisp with four pillows (2 soft, 2 firm) on each bed, and the sofa bed was also newer and stain free. Nice neutral colored drapes covered the large windows and sliding door to the small balcony. Each room has its own air conditioner that you can set to your comfort. Ours wasn't working, so we called the desk and within 5 minutes, a repairman arrived and put a whole new unit in, so we were cool the rest of the night (it was VERY hot). Unfortunately it had stopped working again by morning, and again, there was a second new air conditioner put in within 30 minutes, and no problems after that. The bathroom was spacious and clean, and they weren't selfish with soaps or shampoos or towels at all. And every day that the maid cleaned, you could tell that she CLEANED! Not just replace the towels and make the beds. Water spots were gone each day, the toilets were scrubbed as well as the tub and sink each day. And they actually give you glass glasses instead of those wasteful plastic cups in most hotels. All in all, we were 99% happy with our choice. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the small balcony. The balconies are not large enough to sit outside on, only to stand one or two people at most. I would have liked to be able to sit outside at night and watch the ocean or the bay. The staff of the hotel were all polite and attentive, anxious to help any way they could. And I believe they keep the pets on one floor. We never smelled or found any evidence of dogs there unless we were coming in or going out and ran across an owner with their pet on a leash. The whole hotel was clean and well maintained. They have a wonderful covered oceanfront deck with tables to enjoy a cold drink from their tiki bar, or their inside bar, or to just sit and relax, and with two pools......perfect! We would definitely stay there again..........and again............and again.

Most recent stay was last week of August. After checking in and walking around the hotel, my wife and I were disappointed at the overall housekeeping of common areas such as hallways, the Terrace Level, indoor pool area, Breakers Pub, elevators, etc. Our floor (12th) was very warm as it did not seem the hallway air conditioner was on or working. The place just seemed like it needed a good cleaning. I woke up early the next morning and saw a large tour group of 2 busloads of people checking out. The cleanliness seemed to improve greatly as the day went on along with rest of the week as housekeeping staff was seen cleaning elevators, vacuuming the Terrace Level, and attending to rooms in a timely manner. We again had the room with 2 beds and a pull-out sofa. The room is a bit tight for 2 adults and 2 teenage children but we do not spend much time in the room. The rooms are not fancy but our room was in decent condition, clean, and TV, coffee maker, air conditioning, refrigerator, and lights all worked. Ate a Breakers Pub one evening and had the buffet at Horizons another evening. I really enjoyed the buffet this time. The prime rib was very good. My son had the buffet breakfast at Horizons most mornings and had an ear to ear smile every time he was done. We continue to enjoy the the more quiet location (101st street) of the Clarion and beach in front of the hotel is fantastic. The fitness center at the hotel is well equipped with cardio equipment, weights, a sauna, steam room, and showers. I do think the property is nearing the time for some updating.

It isn't. Its small rooms and balconies, and outdated layout will not let it be anything special. It is also trying to wring every dollar out of its guests during the season. For nearly $300 per night, really, I expected more. We stayed there for three nights beginning on August 1, 2012. We had two adults and three kids in a room. The room was of average size for an average hotel. The bathroom was a handicapped bath with a roll-in shower, becuase we had been booked for a room without a fold out bed by mistake and they had to change us at the last minute. The roll-in shower allowed water to leak out onto the bathroom floor, and nothing was really provided to prevent that or to alleviate the condition by soaking up the water. The bathroom was also small. The air conditioning unit was an older model that had no thermostat. It kept the room cool but since you couldn't set a temperature, you would wake up in the middle of each night either too warm or too cold. The balconies of this hotel are the worst part of the rooms. They are extremely small triangular balconies that face north or south along the beach. They are too small to even put one chair on, so forget about relaxing out there with a dink and enjoying the view. Further, because the bottom of this hotel around the tower, forming the conference center and \"resort\" has grown so large, the view is basically many commercial air handlers, with associated noise. We were on the sixth floor and we were only a couple of floors above what must have been an acre of roof. the third or fourth floor would have been even worse. The pools were acceptable, but crowded, especially since the hotel rents out about half the condos in the building next door and they have access to the ammenities. The drink prices at the bar were offensive. My wife and I decided to have a round of margaritas in the whirlpool and ordered them from the bar. They were about 12 oz. each and served in plastic cups. The price, including tip was $22.00. What a horrible price gouge! We did eat at the buffet one night and, although it was expensive, and having less variety than other buffet's in town, if you want to eat a lot of good crab legs and excellent prime rib, it is probably worth the money. Well, not at the summer price -- that was still a gouge. The service throughout the hotel was very good, from the front desk to the beach rental stand. Overall, it provides what is basically wrong with Ocean City during the summer.

At first when we arrived at the hotel we thought it could have been cleaner, but after experiencing being chased off the beach due to a major thunderstorm I realized that there is no way to control the amount of sand that is dragged into the hotel.

We booked through Priceline so we got a great price of $159 per night for a Monday - Wednesday and I am glad that we got that rate because the hotel wasn't worth much more. We checked in and got our room, the first room, because it wasn't cleaned. They checked us into a room that wasn't serviced. Instead of having room service come up and clean it while we watched, just uncomfortable for everyone, we switched rooms. Our first room although not clean had a view of the ocean and a couch and a flat screen TV. Our second room, which appeared clean, didn't have a couch,had a squat 1980's television, and a view of a roof. We did find cherry stems all over the floor, in one of the beds, and a plastic cup stuffed between the bed and the night stand. It was pretty gross. The 3 elevators were always packed with people. The indoor pool was swarming with kids. The stairs to the beach were steep and I thought a little dangerous. They definitely weren't good for the older guests. The spa and gym were surprisingly packed with equipment and clean though. The entertainment and bar staff seemed nice enough as well as the kids that ran drinks and food to the pool and beach. The hotel is conveniently located though and there was plenty of parking. Bring your own beach towels! You have to take the ones from the pool area and they are not great. The hotel needs a makeover, it appears dingy, dirty, and unkept.

Some of the other reviews I have read mention a problem with finding a spot to park but I did not find this to be a problem. They have a lot in front of the hotel as well as another lot across Coastal Highway. The check in process was very smooth. We were able to check in three hours early which is a good bonus. Every room in the hotel is on the side so you have to turn your head to see the ocean. The room had a small balcony (as advertised) that is for standing only. The room was well furnished with two double beds and a sofa with a pullout bed. The room was very well cleaned and it seemed like the carpet had been recently replaced. Our toilet was quite loud and leaked sometimes. The shower was your typical hotel shower with tub. A complaint of mine with the design of the hotel is the number of elevators at the hotel. For a 16 floor building they only have three elevators. I've stayed at other hotels before in OC and some feature four elevators plus another elevator for service only. On the terrace level (second floor) there is a restaurant and bar which i did not visit. There is a pool inside and outside with a bar located near each. The outdoor pool features poolside food delivery. My one complaint is that the back steps on the hotel that lead to the beach are old wooden steps and I on a couple occasions and I almost fell on them because of their poor design. The staff at this hotel is outstanding. Every time you went past the bellman at the door he greeted you and sometimes had a conversation with you.

Pros *We got a deal through Expedia *It's right on the beach *It is pet friendly *Free wifi *They have indoor & outdoor pools (which were actively monitored by the Clarion staff). *Every room is ocean view *There is a fridge & microwave in the rooms *We had 2 double beds and a pull out couch (handy with a family of 4) Cons *The hotel staff were not very friendly (front desk, restaurant, bartenders/coctail servers) *About 75% of the time there was a LONG wait for the elevators. Although it's not a large hotel, we waited for elevators because they were too full to accomodate my family of 4 (over half the times this was due to the staff riding in them in masse). *The rooms were not cleaned very well (someone else's hairs in the bathtub, filthy bathroom door, coffee pot/basket not emptied) *No one told us that we had to set up a charge account upon check in to charge bar purchases to our room. *The restaurant (seafood buffet) was mostly prefabricated, tasteless food (& only 1 free refil of non-alcoholic drinks) for $36/person. *They do not have a charge/debit card machine. They still use the imprint system. Not only is that antiquated, it made my husband & myself very uneasy (due to ease of identity theft). We realize that we were guests over Memorial Day weekend (one of the busiest weekends of the year), however, I would think the staff would be \"fresh\", friendly & eager to start the summer season off (regardless what time of year, customer service should be number 1). I honestly do not understand having free wifi, but not having credit/debit card machines. I thought imprinting was obsolete.

We usually stay at the hilton but decided to switch it up a bit and figured for the cost of this, it HAD to be comparable to a nicer hotel, boy was i wrong! If you are looking at this hotel and are under the age of 50, please take my advice and spend the extra $10-20.00 and go to the new holiday inn or hilton. Not only does this place need some MAJOR updating (don't think the room has been updated since the early 90's (and that's being gratious), but it could stand for some better cleaners as well. Our bathroom was FILTHY with all sorts of \"spots\" all over both the toilet and bathtub ans the carpet was filthy!. This hotel is definately for a MUCH older crowd (from what we saw anyway) also. OH and the room service menu is a joke (really, $11.00 for eggs, toast potatoes and meat?!?!?!) The only upside i saw in staying here is that it is only 1/2 mile from the Greene Turtle. After staying at the Turtle for a while and taking a taxi to Ocean Downs (appx. $26.00 each way) we decided to end the night at the bar where they had a cover band with no cover and we were met by hands down the RUDEST and most arrogant bartender i have EVER come across. Not only was the bartender rude but we were charged almost $18.00 for two of the weakest drinks i think i may have ever been served. He was really rude and degrading not only to my husband and myself but to someone on the phone who had called in as well. I have been coming to OCMD since i was 5 years old and have really never been more disappointed in a hotel. At least when i have stayed at dives for $50.00 a night i knew what i was getting myself into. To think i paid so much for such an outdated place and rude service to boot makes me want to kick myself. I'm hoping at least this review will save young couples from making the same mistake e did, so again, PLEASE either spend the extra $20.00 for a real upscale hotel, or save yourselves some money for the same type of room and book at somewhere with a rating of a star or two. Lastly, to the management... you are one of the few hotels i have ever seen to not offer a flat military discount (no we were not part of a group or contracted... i asked). Maybe that should have been my clue... Perhaps had we gotten a discount,the price would have been a little bit easier to stomach. Needless to say, we will definately not be staying here again and i will make it a point to tell everyone and military person/spouse i know to follow our lead", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder", "Title": "\u201cHigh Praise\u201d", "Author": "MMLBoulder", "ReviewID": "UR129023225", "Content": "My son was married on the beach behind the Clarion Resort Hotel.

There is a very small balcony that provided a great ocean view. I requested this when booking and they complied. The staff was very friendly, check in/out was flawless. There is a great tropical themed patio and outdoor bar between the hotel and beach, which is just a very short walk over a small dune away. I prefer the location - 5 minute drive to the inlet/boardwalk depending on traffic lights - as opposed to being in the middle of all the action (and noise.) The restaurant and pub (sports theme) were both excellent. The views are awesome and the food and service was some of the best I have had in a hotel in a long time. Prices are reasonable. They also handled the buffet banquet our group had and they did a superb job with that as well. As others have mentioned the parking lot is split with some across the street. This seems to be a common theme in Ocean City as the land on the ocean side is too valuable to use that way. However there are a very large number of handicapped designated spaces in the main lot near the entrance which should serve those with mobility issues. The step for any business from good to great is a big one. In this case the raw material is there - put in some new mattresses, add nicer sheets (i.e. create a bed you never want to get out of) and you will have a great 4 star hotel.

Very few hotels in OC allow dogs and since the conference was at the Clarion and it allowed dogs, we booked there. First, the positives. The staff was very, very friendly and welcoming and even applied a better advertised rate than what we originally booked for to our bill. In the back of the hotel, there was a designated \"pet park\" and we had views of both the ocean and the bay in a little \"standing room only\" balcony. The business center in the hotel was wonderful and had computers with free internet access and free printing and there was free wireless connection to the internet throughout the hotel so it made working from the hotel very easy. Now, the negatives. As to our room, I realize that certain rooms are designated \"pet-friendly\" so that other guests who may have allergies or not want to sleep in a room that has had a pet are not subject to those rooms. However, it seemed that by being a pet-friendly room meant being subjected to a lower standard. That being said, I've stayed in plenty of pet-friendly places and none of them have been as dirty/unclean as this one. While the \"surface\" of the room was fine, there was grime in all the corners, gunk (not sure what it was) stuck to the wall, the couch had stains, the curtains had stains, the bathroom tub had rust marks, the towels had hairs, and most importantly, it really, really smelled. Plus, the TV was very antiquated, the remote didn't work, and the A/C/Fan was extremely noisy, like a belt was loose. Furthermore, the pet friendly rooms are only available as double beds. Finally, the hotel doesn't enforce the no-smoking policy very well and since we had to have our balcony door open (see the comment about the smell above) the entire time we were in the room, we were constantly bombarded by the smell of smoke from smokers on their balconies. Next year we will leave the dog at home and book at a different hotel.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cFamily Vacation Time!\u201d", "Author": "shellb4", "ReviewID": "UR118117992", "Content": "We stayed 3 night in late August with a two adjoined rooms to fit out big family.

I was asked on 2 occasions if enough towels were in our room and the room was attended to by 12:00PM each day. Common areas such as hallways, pools, fitness center and spa seemed cleaner. On a few occasions, I saw employees polishing the luggage carts. Our room was on the 15th floor and had 2 beds along with a pull-out sofa bed. Rooms are not fancy but still decently decorated and well maintained. A coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, and hair dryer are included. Next time I will ask if larger rooms or suites are available. Room is adequate size but we could have used some extra space now that my children are both teenagers. Equipment in fitness center worked and all machines seemed in good condition. A fairly large sauna and steam room is included along with showers and towels. Having the outdoor pool now is a plus. Had dinner 2 evenings in Breakers Pub and food was good and reasonably priced. Buffet breakfast in Horizons Restaurant was thoroughly enjoyed. This is the type of hotel that you can basically park your car, check-in, and not move your car until checking out.

My boyfriend and I were there from August 23rd to 25th. The staff was friendly. The hotel was okay, the bathroom had kind of a musty scent so did the carpet but it wasn't awful. There was a balcony that could only fit two people standing but we knew that going in. It was nice to go out on the balcony and feel for the weather and look out at the sunset. Also, on the last day we opened the ice bucket and saw empty bag of pork grinds in it which lead us to believe that they didn't clean our room that well. The perks of this place is there is a beach literally right outside the back of hotel, so no need to travel very far for some relaxation. We didn't eat at the buffet but heard good things. There are many restaurants outside of the hotel that you can eat at as well. We went to the gift shop which was small but has the basic apparel and snacks and such. I would advise that you bring your own beach chairs and umbrella so don't have to rent on the beach. Parking was not a problem to find as I have read on these reviews before. However, I noticed that they did have overflow of parking located across the highway. We went to the boardwalk twice really its like a 15 minute drive not bad at all and parking on the street by the boardwalk is a $1 an hour, so couldn't complain. The Lenny's bar and Grill located by the beach, selection of food wasn't that great, pretty generic stuff fries, burgers, onion rings, and chicken fingers..basically boardwalk food which we were tired of but if you have kids it will due especially since its right by the indoor pool. The hotel has 3 pools which is nice, 3 outdoor, and one inside. Overall hotel is good not the BEST but for a little weekend gateway it was good for us. Definitely a hotel for families they had a lot of little activities for the children. In addition, our last night we had to leave early because of Hurricane Irene which evacuated the whole hotel and all of ocean city. We didn't mind and the hotel was very HELPFUL in refunding guest's money and finding other accommodations for them.

The hotel does show its age and wear, but that's to be expected. The food was rather good and the service was also very good. Easy access to the beach directly in front of the hotel and a really great beach bar (my hat's off to the Lenny's staff - thank you Adam, Mary, Jason and David for outstanding unflinching service!). A few observations - If you use a debit card, be forewarned that without manager approval you cannot charge items to your room. This is not explained to you at check-in, and it caused me some grief and embarrassment during my first attempted purchase. Yes, this is a pet friendly hotel but, even on the holiday weekend, all I saw was the occasional pet on a leash going up and down the elevator and out for a doggie walk (to a conveniently located doggie area next to the hotel for their business). As a dog owner, I appreciate this for future travel. I saw no evidence of dogs around any of the main public areas such as the bars, pools or spas and no signs of any smells or anything that would put off someone who's not into pets. Yes, this is a family hotel so there will be lots of small children crowded into both the indoor and outdoor pools from opening to closing with the expected level of noise, splashing and activity that goes with it. If you want to get some sun and water in a more peaceful setting, stroll down a few hundred yards to the beach. Remember that this hotel is simply not near anything other than mostly high rise condo buildings. Other than the onsite restaurants, you'll be forced to get in your car and shuttle up and down Coastal Highway to go out to eat, which isn't all that bad, but it will be necessary. They do have free parking so there was no additional expense to come and go. You're about 70 blocks north of the end of the Boardwalk so this really isn't OC as you may think if you're coming from out of the area. If you're booking online, be sure to go to the hotel's direct website (www.clarionoc.com) rather than through the www.choicehotels.com website.

Even though we have the beach right outside our house, she loves the boardwalk and the atmosphere of OC, so we make the trip up and stay a couple of nights in the summer. I have only tried one other hotel once, and while it was certainly commendable, the Fontainebleau reminds me of my childhood, and an experience that I can pass on to my soon-to-be wife. She loved it every bit as much as I did. The place just has that feeling of countless summers of happiness in its aging but still welcoming walls. The desk staff is ALWAYS on the ball--never quite perfect, but way above the OC standard. You don't get the feeling you are being ripped off. The price isn't the cheapest, but the location is stellar, and we've never had a headache. I'll avoid going back to the days when this was the Sheraton Fontainebleau and I was a coming-of-age teen during Beach Week and rate it as a now-matured adult for the benefit of the TripAdvisor public, but it's hard to avoid some of those memories. Those who come here again and again understand the sheer nostalgic value of this place and their fantastic memories that they've made here. We checked in on a Tuesday evening and took advantage of the hotel's Romance Package, which is perhaps a bit kitschy, but sure produced smiles out of the girlfriend. As she grew up in the Rocky Mountains, she never had much in the way of a beach experience, and she just loved every minute of it--even the rose that was left on the bed (ordinarily, she hates them, but it's a nice touch!). It won't knock your socks off, but getting to spend some of your meal credits on room service is a nice touch. The food is typical beach fare, but fills you up. You can only take so much of the Dough Roller, after all. The beach at OC is of course crowded beyond belief, but outside the Fontainebleau around 101st St., you'll find it slightly less mobbed. SLIGHTLY. This can save a lot of headaches, though. Things are always CLEAN here, and let me tell you if you are an inexperienced OC traveler--that is something you certainly do not find everywhere. There are no shortage of unscrupulous dives in this town that make their money off the allowances and babysitting wages of Mid-Atlantic high schoolers. The Fontainebleau isn't rock bottom in price, but you'll always have an acceptable and comfortable level of cleanliness as well as service. We will be back next year and may even try one of their cabanas. Check it out--I would be willing to bet that with the hundreds of thousands (probably getting near millions) of families with screaming children who road trip here summer after scorching summer, the amount of negative reviews that OC hotels get is drastically higher than most other places.

She wrote on a scrap piece of paper mold on ceiling, gross stains on carpet. That left my family with the impression that our complaint was only good enough for a scrap piece of paper. We were very diappointment. We will never stay at a clarion. We plan on telling friends and family about our experience. We only stayed one night and moved onto the Dunes Manor Hotel.

Prior to my arrival, I made the mistake of reading hotel reviews -- and the reviews were actually almost scaring me. Prior to my recent stay, I never read hotel reviews and never wrote one. However, I felt moved to write this one, due to the negative press I previously had been reading regarding the Clarion. I found the room very neat & clean -- I was most pleased with the linens on the bed (so nice, luxurious & soft)! Since I had a pet with me and was meet friends on another part of the beach most days, I missed room cleaning time. However, early in the morning, I took it upon myself to call Housekeeping (not the front desk) -- I made arrangements with a time when they could come in to clean (and I would be with the dog) and/or I exchanged dirty towels for clean towels. The 2-3 times I did so, I found them to be most courteous, timely, efficient & thorough. Another time, my toilet was running, but was unable to fix the problem myself. I called the front desk who called maintenance. I asked them for an estimate of time for arrival & was stunned when they arrived within 5 minutes -- no more than another 5 minutes before the problem was fixed. Another time, my room key wouldn't work -- within 5 minutes, that was a non-issue. Periodically, I had questions and I was always met with friendliness and courtesy -- very professional staff. I stayed on a pet floor (brought my 11 year old lab mix). I was on the pet floor (5th floor) -- my only wish was that I had a room that had a closer view to the ocean. However, that's no problem -- I'll know what to ask for the next time. Only other negatives lie with other pet owners -- pet owners (and I am one) need to be responsible!!! If your pet has separation anxiety issues, be courteous of other hotel guests I was very happy to be travelling with my dog. Any issues that I might have had during my stay really pertain and should be directed to other dog owners. Advice to those who might be travelling with pets. The hotel offers a wonderful perk -- ability to bring your pet. Please do not ruin a good thing by being irresponsible. You know it's the law -- pick up after your pet. The sandlot there for you & your pet --- they supply bags, a trash dispenser AND a pooper-scooper. There is not one excuse for not picking up after your pet. I was stunned that people were not picking up after their pet and this was difficult especially in the evening. I got around the issue by taking my dog for longer walks (across the street (bayside of Coastal Highway). In addition, I used the fan a lot to drown out the whines and/or barking from other dogs. If you know your dog has separation anxiety issues, you might not want to stay out all night -- be courteous of the other hotel guests and their pets -- this is their vacation too! All in all, I (WE -- my dog & I) had a WONDERFUL time! Very courteous staff and very clean hotel -- we will glady come & stay at the Clarion again!!! :-) (Next time, I know that I will check for specials -- I stayed for $250 per night -- no inclusion of meals, spa time, etc. -- however, I think that's something I myself should have done a better job of looking into before having booked my stay. I should have looked for available specials.)", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA restful, pleasant stay at the Clarion\u201d", "Author": "ihatedopes", "ReviewID": "UR72263674", "Content": "I was happy with the room and the Clarion in general.

We planned this trip for many months and looked forward to trying something new (new place, new hotel). Unfortunately, staying at this hotel was a big mistake. The furniture was old and needed refreshing and it's the first hotel I've stayed in in 5 years that didn't have flat-panel HDTV's. But, this is not the real problem of the place. Our biggest problem was that the hotel allows non-guests to sit at the pool and use all the facilities at the hotel. Throughout our stay the pool, which is very small, was crowded and many people were not guests at the hotel. In addition, a few people put up tent-like structures on the beach with coolers and every other amenity you could think of. OK, I guess they have a right even if they're not staying at the hotelt, but what bothered us is when this one guy was telling someone else that the hotel allows non-guests to use all the facilities (parking lot, pool, beach, bathrooms, pool towels). I hate to sound like a spoilsport, but what am I paying for if anyone can drive up, park in the lot, and use the pool and beach without being an overnight guest? I sent an e-mail to Choice Hotels and the hotel's general manager sent me an e-mail explaining the hotel policy which allows anyone to use the restaurant, bars, and other facilities on the premises. He offered to help us plan our next trip there and would see that we got a good room rate, but why on earth would we ever stay there again?!?. Although the staff is friendly the rooms aren't nice enough and we didn't go there to be packed like sardines while sharing the facilities with non-overnight guests. That so many people come onto the premises from the parking lot made us feel less safe as there didn't seem to be any deterent if people came with the wrong intensions. I also don't know what prevented strangers from accessing the rooms if they just got on an elevator and got off wherever they wanted. I responded to the general manager that we would never stay there again and repeated that when I called Choice Hotels today to follow up. While the hotel must do remarkably well because of the free access to the premises it really doesn't work as well for people who do not appreciate the \"open party\" atmosphere. Regardless of how management responds to my review I find their policies unacceptable and don't care about what they might say beyond that.

When I drove up to check in, an apparent vagrant was loitering at the entrance, no valets to be seen.I has reserved a room on the north facing side of the building, knowing from the past that the afternoon band in the outdoor bar at the southeast corner will interfere with work or a nap. The Clarion had no such reservation, so I reiterated my request in person to the check in clerk. The cargo elevator (Filthy, and generally the elevator that comes upon call) brought me to a hallway that clearly had not been vacuumed in days and smelled like a sewage backup. On entering the room, you guessed it--south facing, as well as filthy and smelly. I demanded a change and after a long argument in which the clerk claimed it was my fault they did not have a record of the correct reservation, that I \"shouldn't \" be bothered by the rock band,and that there were no north facing rooms available, I was moved to the 9th floor (again, via the filthy cargo elevator) to an equally foul room but north facing room. When I stepped off the elevator I noticed a powdery white substance, perhaps a crushed mint, front and center. in the elevator foyer It was still there when I checked out 3 days later--the hallway was never vacuumed during that time, and it looked and smelled as if it was so neglected for a good deal longer! . The fellow who met me to let me in to the room was, to my shock, the vagrant from out front--a hotel employee! This frightening individual kept angling for a tip until I kicked him out. The carpet was filthy and multiply stained. Dust besmirched every surface. I opened the curtain for a look out at the evening, only to find a little pile of candy wrappers never cleaned from prior guests. Gobs of greasy dust coated the vents for the AC. Because of the extensive mildew and foul odor I had to keep the AC running (LOUDLY, I must add) the whole time--so much for ocean breezes through my window.Later, I discovered standing water in the bathtub. EEEEEWWWW. I was truly horrified by the condition of this room but since it was as bad as the first room and the general atmosphere of filth and uncaring staff indicated that more complaining would make no difference, I resigned myself to my lot--which meant touching things as little as possible, not using the shower (!) (or any other item where MRSA could linger, such as their much touted \"spa\" facility--can you imagine what the steam room is like? The locker rooms?

Both nights sleep was interrupted repeatedly and for long periods due to neighboring vacationers acting as if it's their own home.

They even granted our initial request to be in a king room! Dislikes: - Our biggest discrepency was that the pool room was freezing on the first day. So much so that our baby's lips turned blue and he started shivering. I called down and the front desk attendant said she was unaware of the problem and that she would have it taken care of. I find it odd that all day not one hotel staff noticed the temperature was freezing? On the second day, it was better, but still chilly and then on the third day, still chilly and the pool water wasn't that warm. We also had to call down to have clean towels delievered to the pool because there was a bin of old ones from the day before; no clean ones. Just very disappointed since this was one of the main reasons we stayed and cold temperature ruined the experience. - The room was not the cleanest; there were white stains on the carpet and the tub drain didn't work properly. - The heater was LOUD! Every time it turned on, it woke all of us up. It was also tempermental; either too cold or too hot; just didn't work properly. There was also a leak in the window and was a pool of water on the heater. - We asked for an extended stay to take a nap, which they granted, but apparently they were fixing the sliding glass doors and the banging and drilling was extremely annoying. No idea why they would start at 9:00 in the morning and not warn the guests staying in the hotel. - We thought it was rediculous that they would charge $4 to use the fitness center; seriously! Our trip overall was enjoyable, but the highlight was not the hotel.

We chose the Clarion due to it's very reasonable rate, the amenities, the ocean view from our room and, of course, it's location directly on the beach. The major disappointment during our trip, which had NOTHING to do with the hotel, was the weather. It rained the entire time we were at the beach (Monday, Sept 7 - Friday, Sept 11). The trip was full of mixed emotions because of the weather, as you can imagine. However, just about everything at the hotel met or exceeded our expectations. Here's a review of our experience at The Clarion: 1. The front desk staff at check in was very nice. The lobby of the hotel is very inviting and you definitely feel like you're at the beach when you enter the hotel. All of the staff members are wearing tropical button up shirts and there are many different things in the lobby that reflect the bright colors of what a tropical paradise would be expected to look like. 2. There is a business center right off of the main lobby that is only accesible with your room key. It features two high speed internet computers and a printer. I don't have a lap top (just a desk top at home) so it was nice to have access to the computers to check my personal email and to explore info about Ocean City. Of course, another thing to note: There is a concierge in the hotel who appeared to be available to answer any questions regarding things to do in Ocean City. We did not use the services of the concierge. 3. Our room was on the 9th floor and looked EXACTLY like the room that's featured on the website's virtual tour. The room was great. It was very spacious. There was a microwave and fridge (the microwave seemed a little older as we had a hard time opening it several times -- however, with determination, it would finally open). There were two double beds that were very comfortable (unfortunately, the pillows had a musty smell to them but my Mom and I always travel with Febreeze. We Febreezed them every day and they eventually were fine). There was a couch in the room and a nice table and chairs that could have been used as a desk or a dining table. There were three chairs around the table. And then of course one of our favorite features, was the 'standing room only' balcony. We noticed upon checking in that the screen door on the sliding doors had a tear in it and we didn't want to be held responsible for this damage since we, of course, had nothing to do with it. We called the front desk and it was replaced immediately. We were VERY impressed. As well, the bathroom was very spacious and plenty of towels and wash cloths were provided. Also, their bath products are made by Neutrogena and we really enjoyed using them. 4. Upon our first night of arriving, we didn't feel like going out for dinner, so we decided to order room service. The food came from the in house restaurant called \"Horizons\". I had a Chicken Ceasar Salad and my Mom had Chicken Breast topped with Crab Meat and a special sauce, a baked potato, some sort of vegetable, bread and she got a pot of coffee and we had glasses of water. My salad was delicious and Mom's dish (I had to taste it, of course) was beyond words! It was so good it melted in your mouth. The gentleman who brought the food in was very nice but for the price, I guess I expected him to help us set things up like a waiter would, but he didn't. The tip was included in the order so we spent $12.00 on his just brining our meal up (a 15% tip is included on room service orders). He literally set everything on the coffee table and just left. I guess I expected more but maybe I'm wrong in doing so. Regardless, the food was great! 5. Since it rained the entire time, Mom and I did a lot of sleeping in each morning, shopping, eating out and movie watching. 6. Horizons, the restaurant on the property, had a live band peform each night from 9 p.m. - ?. Bars are not are thing so we didn't go down for that but we did agree this was a nice thing to have for guests so you literally didn't have to go anywhere while you're vacationing. 7. I did use the indoor pool twice and I thought it could be a little bit cleaner than it was. The water temperature was perfect. I was the only one in the pool (while my Mom sat pool side and read), but each time I swam, many, many long hairs would get tangled in my fingers and I even had to swipe a few out of my mouth (I'm bald, so I know they weren't my hairs). As well, in the bootm of the pool you could see large strips of sand that seemed to form near a drain at the bottom. Then, several tables had trash on them from where I assume guests had been sitting and eating and drinking (technically I don't think you're allowed to eat near the pool); it amazes me how lazy people can be when they're out and can't clean up after themselves. There were trash cans all over the place. 8. There was a covered outdoor seating area that appeared to be part of the outdoor dining area when the weather was probably nicer but it was available to guests for smoking (the entire hotel is 100% smoke free with designated smoking areas on the property). My Mom is a smoker (I'm not) so it was nice for us to go sit there while it was raining so we could watch the big waves, relax and people watch. Each time we were passed by a Clarion Hotel employee we were always greeted and small talk always ensued. The Clarion also has it's own private beach and during the peak season there's a bar that's outside and an uncovered seating area with tables and chairs surrounded by tropical flowers and trees. 9. The only unfriendly employee that we came across was a bellman who was pushy and appeared to only have his agenda as a priority. On several occasions, Mom and I would return from being out and would come through the main entrance of the hotel. As we would be working our way toward the elevator, this man would apparently be loading up another guest's luggage onto a luggage cart to take to their room. More than once, he literally pushed the luggage cart right in front of us and would take the elevator that we had been waiting for. Now this may sound trivial or childish, there's a point about the story. We were a guest and we were just as important as the guest he was servicing. We felt like he was working for a tip and really disregarded anyone else in the lobby except for the people he was servicing. He just seemed very aloof and unaware of anything else that was going on around him. Things like this annoy me. If you're in line waiting for ANYTHING, you shouldn't jump the line. Of course, I didn't say anything while we were at the hotel because Mom kept telling me to let it go. Of course, I wanted to include it here. 10. Last but not least, there were two gift shops on the premises. There was a jewelry store that my Mom enjoyed visiting and then there was a general type of gift shop that offered small souvenirs, snacks, post cards and such. I think it would have been nice if the gift shop carried a little more selection of small gifts but I'm sure the size of the gift shop had something to do with it. Also, on the same floor of the gift shops and the restaurants appeared to be where the convention center activities were. There seemed to be a couple of conventions going on while we were there and though that could seem like a disruption to vacationers, it actually was nice to see that many people meandering around the hotel. There was a spa available, too, on this floor (which was caleld the Terrace) but we did not use their services. There was one other restaurant/bar that was open (and I can't think of their name to save my life). In closing, I want to say that we were quite pleased with the hotel. We didn't get housekeeping service every single day but the one day we went out late after sleeping in and lounging (remember, we had TONS of rain) we called for housekeeping services and to our surprise they sent someone right up. It was almost 3 p.m. and we thought it was mosly likely too late to get the room cleaned up Every housekeeper we came into contact with was very friendly and offered great customer service. We definitely tipped them! Again, it rained EVERY SINGLE DAY! We literally went on the beach for about ten minutes the first day because the wind gusts were anywhere from 20 - 40 mph and a couple of days it rained a minimum of 2 to 4 inches of rain! Even when we'd try to stand on the 'standing only' balcony, we would get pelted with rain drops that were coming down so hard it hurt!", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cBest ocean vacation yet!!\u201d", "Author": "PA-IndianRider", "ReviewID": "UR41415414", "Content": "On the day we made reservations to stay at The Clarion Fontainbleau Hotel (101 St.) was an indication of how perfect our vacation was going to be.

Reviews on TripAdvisor, including replies from the hotel, helped me choose the Clarion over some other places we were considering. The Internet special rate gave us a good deal, $180/night. Due to a booking error, we ended up with an ocean view room without paying the extra cost for it, which was very nice. It was an excellent value. We traveled with two children under 10 and my mother, who is elderly and not very mobile. The Clarion had everything we could want. - Ample parking right there. - We walked right onto the private beach. The ocean water was warm and waves were wonderful. Lifeguards were attentive. Umbrellas and chairs were available for renting. Boogie boarding was permitted (unlike at nearby Assateague). Plenty of sprayers to wash off before entering the hotel. - The hotel had beach wheelchairs available for our use, which my mother needed. They also loaned us a regular wheelchair for convenience when ours was in the car. - The indoor and outdoor pools were perfect and gave the kids endless hours of fun - warm, not too crowded, ample towels, sizable, with attentive but not overbearing lifeguards. There was an outdoor jacuzzi too. From the pools, you could hear the band playing, and order a drink or food. - The bar overlooked the beach and had great drinks and decent food for kids and adults, without being a ripoff. We hadn't expected to go there but hit it every day for a nice break after the beach. There was a bank, which was pleasant, and fine service. - As a bonus, my younger child enjoyed the clown with her face painting and great balloon animals, while my older child and husband really loved the lesson from the champion boogie boarder, provided gratis, on the beach two evenings. Who knew you could stand on a boogie board or do 360s'? - Free wifi in the room was also most welcome. - The staff was very helpful and friendly. The concierge provided advice on where to kayak, helped us load up during busy check out time, and assisted with whatever we needed. As noted earlier, they handled a booking error well. Our air conditioner broke one day and they had it replaced within 30 minutes. - The health club was great including a steam room, sauna, hot whirlpool, and eucalyptus room. - The location was fine. We ended up driving to the boardwalk and parking due to my mom's need for a wheelchair and found that to be convenient. - The hotel allows dogs, but that wasn't a problem for non dog owners, like us. They were cute but not obnoxious. - All the basics were spot on: clean room, friendly service, amenities, etc. - Anything to complain about? Not really. An occasional wait for elevators during busy checkin and checkout times, the original room mixup, but minor inconveniences. We might have liked a bigger gift shop. Having never been to Ocean City, we enjoyed what it had to offer - the beach, the boardwalk, crabs, and Assateague Island. My kids dubbed it the best hotel ever.

Unfortunately the problem goes beyond a good scrubbing. You can see the mold creeping in from behind the drop-ceiling tiles in the bathroom. We kept the bathroom door closed as much as possible, but my asthma was acting up the whole time. Part of the problem, I believe, is due to the very weak ventilation system in the bathroom. The bathroom vent fan doesn't circulate much air and I wonder if it is even vented to the outside. It is really a shame that this is the case, because the rest of the hotel is nice.

When I got there the check in was smooth and the staff was friendly. But when I got to my room and went to the bathroom I noticed there were no hand towels or wash cloths, the toilet tissue wasn't changed and the toilet seat was dirty (like cigarette ashes on it). I work in a boutique hotel and know what a cleaned bathroom should look like. I was slightly uncomfortable with that, but since it seemed that the rest of the room had been cleaned, I overlooked it. I later learned that the toilet kept running every so many minutes, which started to get annoying, but figured I could just close the bathroom door. What made my experience extremely disgusting was when I was ready to get in the bed, only to pull the sheets back and see a blood stain. Not a little sprinkle but a large enough stain that no one could miss. I would've taken a picture but didn't think to do so until after I was in the new room. It was so disgusting because housekeeping took the time to make the bed perfectly and fluff the pillows, but didn't bother to change the bed linen. I called the front desk for them to switch my room, and they called right back and told me to come get my key. I went downstairs to get my key to the new room (which ended up being directly across the hall), but wasn't given any kind of apology from the staff, they didn't bother to comp my room, half of my stay or even give me a credit for room service or any other form of compensation for this disgusting experience. Needless to say I wouldn't eat in a place that didn't change their sheets, but I did frequent the bar. The highlight of this stay was the bartender, Kevin. He would be the ONLY reason I go back here and that would just be the happy hour. I didn't sleep well, as I only kept thinking that the pillows and sheets in the new room weren't 100% clean either and probably weren't changed since there were no obvious stains (not that that mattered). So I slept on top of the sheets, and kept my arm between my face and the pillow. The hotel is pretty far from the boardwalk, as the hotel is located on 101 St., and the heart of the boardwalk is around 2nd Street. You do the math, and do not try walking.

One of our guys arrived from the south pulling a boat and he had no problems with space for it across the street. The animals were not a problem and weren't a factor in our stay even though we saw many of them. This is because they were on other floors and all the owners seemed to be sensitive to other people and handled the dogs accordingly.

Although I truly appreciated Russell\u2019s help, I could have easily managed our stuff and the rack myself, but I was told that all the ones available for guest use were \u201ctaken\u201d and that unless I wanted to wait indefinitely, I would need to utilize a bellman. Same thing when we checked out. Frankly, since there aren\u2019t enough elevators at the hotel, it seems that being forced to use a bell person\u2019s services just adds to the already problematic and over-crowded elevator situation. I overheard at least two families planning to hit the beach earlier the next day because of the crowds trying to get down on the elevators at the same time everyday. Then we got to our room. On the fifth floor (the pet/smoking floor, apparently), it was right next to the elevators, but fortunately, we didn\u2019t notice much noise during our two-day stay. We did have an ocean view, to the left of the balcony. We actually saw dolphins frolicking offshore a couple of times! I figured that the rooms that are maintained for pet accommodations probably wouldn\u2019t be plush, but the condition of our room was very disappointing. The carpet was visibly dirty and recently stained in many places. The footstool for the chair had a large brown smear on the side of it - care to speculate? The screen door on the balcony was broken. There was water/condensation dripping from somewhere higher on the hotel, and you would get wet if you stepped onto the balcony \u2013 the first time it happened, I thought it had started raining! Probably the worst thing about the room was the shower. Imagine coming in from spending the day on the beach, all hot and sticky, and you get in the shower and -- all you can get is scalding hot water! Not fun at all, and it actually prevented us from taking a dip the next morning before checking out. It seems that for the extra $30 a night charged to keep our dog with us, the least the hotel could have done was provided a clean, usable room. Also, the pet area is rather far away from the hotel\u2019s front entrance; Billy didn\u2019t make it a couple of times, and had to pee on in the parking lot :) Dogs are not allowed in the dining or pool areas, and not on the beach at all during the season; however, there was a group of people at the pool bar area who had their poodle with them, and no one seemed to mind. In our opinion, Billy had to spend too much time in the room to make it worth bringing him again during regular season (although he really enjoyed the small balcony, but watching him stretch his nose well beyond the railing made us quite nervous.) Now the good things. Overall, the staff at the hotel were just outstanding. They were unfailingly cheerful and helpful. We dined at Horizons for our anniversary dinner, instead of going to the all-you-can-eat buffet being served in a conference room. Horizons was relatively empty, and we were able to enjoy our meal at an oceanfront table. The prime rib was very good (plus you get 20% off all entrees before 7:00 pm, which was a nice surprise) and the service was attentive, if a little overly familiar. After dinner, we hung out at the pool bar, right above Lenny\u2019s beach bar, and enjoyed the live music and an after dinner cocktail. We hit the beach around noon on Sunday, and my limping hubby went down early and was able to get the pleasant young man who rented the beach chairs and umbrellas to set us up. The food and drink service on the beach was great \u2013 Jana was very cheerful and provided speedy service too. The pool bar makes a mean pina colada (just ask for a little extra rum!!!) Overall, the hotel staff get a 9 and the hotel itself gets a 5. I\u2019d go back, but probably only off-season. I will post some photos of the room and views a bit later.", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cJust okay\u201d", "Author": "Payd2Type", "ReviewID": "UR3807383", "Content": "My family has gone to the Clarion since way back when it was the Sheraton.

It states that if you leave the pet unattended in the room and it barks or cries, the hotel can go in and remove the pet. That is totally unacceptable. My toy breed dog is my little kid. Also, the \"pet rooms\" are rooms that obviously no one else will stay in...a view of the ROOF at an \"oceanfront resort\", with the balcony door welded shut. We would've been better off staying bayside. There were also urine stains all over the wallpaper in the bathroom. For all this luxury, they charged us $119 per night PLUS $30 per night pet fee. The pet is not allowed in the hotel restaurants or pool area, and the town of OC does not allow them on the beach or boardwalk. We spent our time confined to the room, as we were afraid to leave our pet even for a few minutes. I was infuriated. We were supposed to leave Tuesday morning, but packed and drove home about 10 Monday night. My detailed letter of complaint to the hotel itself was ignored, and we were charged for 48 full hours.

Had I known then what I know now, I never would have stayed there. Family of 5(myself, husband, 15 yr. old, 4 yr. old & 1 yr. old). I personally didn't have any issues with checking in. But the problems started immediately after that!!!! Went to room(8th floor) & almost got smashed with the elevator doors that shut after 3 seconds! Actually lost my 4 yr. old in elevator as she went up to the 16th floor & I am left standing there helpless. The doors shut before the rest of us were able to get in with our luggage. Great start, right?? It gets worse...Get to room & flip light switch & no light working at door.(Have to turn on bathroom light). Send in my 15 yr. old to turn on lamp while I hold open door so she can see & lamp light is also not working. Finally find a lamp with a working light. Call front desk to replace 2 lightbulbs. Next, the room smells so bad(like a dead animal or worse...just smelled so absolutely rotten & it was NOT a smoking room). Once we took our shoes off, figured out the carpet was soaked in spots & socks came up black from walking around. Yuck!! We end up cranking up the air conditioner & opening up our balcony door just to get fresh air circulating in there. Next, hubby makes coffee & when he goes to pour it, it makes a huge mess as he notices the coffee pot is broken pretty badly on the pour spout.(Another call to the front desk & they replace the pot). Ok, that's the first day! 2nd day, get up, take showers to find out hair dryer doesn't work & I have hair down to my butt, so you can only imagine(another call to the front desk..unreal! they must be lovin' me at this point)...man comes up & has to take dryer off the wall & says he needs to take it to the repair shop & replaces with one that works. Today, my husband who is 6'4 notices a plate of food on top of the tall beureau that holds the TV. When he gets it from the back, it is a moldy plate of fruit(probably someone's previous room service)..Nonetheless, we figured out where part of the smell was coming from. Also, most of the cleaning crew don't speak English(not a horrible thing UNTIL you need something from them & they look at you like you are crazy, especially when you are handing them a plate of moldy fruit)!!!!!! Ok, next day, since we had a Family Plan w/ our hotel room, we go to dinner at restaurant which is included. When we get to restaurant, they ask if we want the buffet. We say Sure! They send us to another room where they have the buffet, which we are promptly told it is an additional 6 bucks per person & that it doesn't include drinks, so we decide not to do buffet & go back to the restaurant where not only do we not pay anything extra, we get served, unlike what would happen at the buffet. Very rude front desk girl at restaurant(she seemed altogether unhappy to see us back)..I said we decided not to get the buffet & I swear it was like she was shocked. Anyway, we end up getting seated & this restaurant,especially the tables are not clean, sugar everywhere, dirty glasses, coffee cups & silverware. We told them at front before we got seated that we needed a high chair for the 1 yr. old(duh!!!). When we are seated, our server comes & we had already been there for 2 minutes & still NO highchair. We ask her for a highchair, she says she'll be right back. Comes back & says, all highchairs were taken to buffet room, so I said, \"Can someone bring us a highchair from that room??\" The girl at the front was also there & says she will see what she can do to get us a highchair. I watched her from the table & she made no attempt whatsoever to get us a highchair. She made no phonecall though at the buffet there were so many workers there, that someone could have brought us a stinkin' highchair. I chalk it up to this woman's rudeness of being someone who apparently doesn't like her job foremost & 2ndly doesn't like families with small children. Server trying to be nice & making excuses for rude woman at front, ends up talking us into a booster seat in which I told her we would need to change tables for a table that had chairs with sides to it so that she wouldn't fall off the side of the chair onto the floor in the booster seat. We changed tables though it seemed like the end of the earth was coming because I asked to do this. It seemed once we were settled, all was good from there. Server very accomodating. Food very good! Then back to the unbearably obnoxiously smelly room. Also, on this particular day, it took housekeeping til 3pm to clean our room. That is just unacceptable. I called to front desk to ask why it seemed like they skipped our room & they told me that they had til' 5pm to clean our room. Indoor pool area nice. Convenient to get to the beach. Ample parking area. We did not visit outdoor bar or indoor bar & did not visit outdoor pool(too busy seeing sites to be worried with all that). Staff at front door of hotel pleasant. People getting room service putting their trays of dirty plates & glasses in the hallway were not getting picked up all day as we came in & out of hotel. Just gross!!!~~~ Checkout was fine. After all this, WE WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN, especially after making us feel bad for wanting to eat in their restaurant(which was included in Family Plan) & heaven forbid, you ask for a highchair!!! If you expect they are prepared for families, you will be highly mistaken & extremely disappointed. I did not like the way I was treated there at all. The blatant grossness of the smelly room which I'm sure had to be hazardous & obviousness that the cleaning crew are doing the bare minimun after finding that moldy plate of food. We had stayed at Comfort Inn in the past & have never had anything less than clean facilities & wonderful service & that is where we will stay from now on. Feel free to let me know your experience, whether you went with family or not doesn't matter. I'd love to hear from you!!!!!!!!~~~~~", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cEverything is right in or near the hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3615181", "Content": "I stayed at the Clarion this past weekend.

One, I got a very cheap rate (70-80 dollars), only a couple of people were on the beach in front of the hotel, so we could let our dogs loose a little. The rooms are very nice, although it wasn't an oceanview room, I could see both the ocean and the bay because I was on like the 7th or 8th floor. In my opinion if you are above the 3rd or 4th floor where the restaurant can't block your view, you can probably see the ocean from any room. My only compliant about the rooms is that the heater was noisy and if you shut it off a draft came in from out side (the rooms have small balconies). Also, the buffet was bad, they cook ommletes or belgium waffles right on the spot, but the bacon was dried out and the sausage didin't taste that good, but other then that the food was great. Also, it was easter sunday, so they didin't have the breakfast at the restaurant like they normally do which is right on the ocean but instead in a room in a banquet room which was a disapointment because the restaurant looked really nice.

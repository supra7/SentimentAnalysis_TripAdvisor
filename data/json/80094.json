The last few hotels I've stayed in were nightmares for a variety of reasons, though the prices were normally at least okay. But price isn't everything. Cleanliness and helpfulness of staff are really hugely key to an enjoyable stay. For my latest trip, I asked the bookstore where I'd be signing for a hotel recommendation. They gave me this one, and thank goodness I asked and listened to them! The hotel has a great location right off the 805 freeway, so in the heart of the San Diego area. It looks dingy from the outside, honestly, but it's the inside that actually matters. Check in was pleasant and fast, and when I asked to change rooms from 2 beds to 1, it was easily handled, with the clerk making sure that I was okay going onto the 3rd floor. There's an elevator, older but working perfectly. Plenty of parking. The room was fine, nothing earth-shattering, but it was incredibly clean, the bed was large and quite comfortable, there were plenty of pillows and towels, and the bathroom was also spotless. The closet is part of the larger outer bathroom/sink area, but I personally found this convenient. Shower head was large, new and stainless steel, bathtub was good with the rounded curtain rod that gives you actual room to bathe. There was a huge chest of drawers and a large TV as well. Free and nicely appointed continental breakfast. Maid service was excellent, and no issues with them cleaning while I was in the room working. No issues with getting extra towels, either. Check out was also pleasant, with clear directions given to find a gas station (I drove for this trip). The free internet actually worked, and worked well. This is not the Ritz by any means, but for a reasonably priced, easy in and out hotel/motel, it's an amazing deal. I will definitely stay here again, eagerly.

The parking is narrow like others have said and I found the walls to be too thin.

There is one opening into the parking lot and the width of the actual space between rows is smaller than average. It took about 10 minutes to get in and out of a parking space with a compact car. This is because you simply cannot pull into a space, without doing various back and forth manuevers to make sure you don't hit either the cars on either side or the ones behind you.

If you want to spend your money on DOING things rather then on where you sleep, then stay here. We stayed here when we went to the San Diego Zoo and Legoland. The hotel is right off the 805, easy to get to and NOT hard to miss (despite what one negative reviewer had to say). Most of the people staying here were business men. Nothing about this hotel felt sleazy or scary. Our rooms were spotlessly clean. We became intimately familiar with our bathrooms as several of our family members were struck with the stomach flu. There is nothing fancy here. THe rooms are clean, linens clean and new looking, furniture new looking. The rooms are small. All doors face outside hallways and there is one window next to each door. The rooms open immediately into the bedroom so be careful entering and exiting if anyone is changing clothes. The bathrooms are located at the back of the room, with the sink and clothes rack opening into the room and only the toilet and shower over tub behind a seperate door. The shower/toilet is small. However the shower curtain over the tub bows out and gives even the largest person plenty of elbow room for showering. The lighting in here is florescent and dim when you initially turn it on, but gets bright within 2 minutes. THis is acutally a nice feature in the middle of the night when a bright toilet light is actually annoying. The musty smell someone complained of in a previous post is actually just a moisture smell from the air conditioner unit. There was no mold any where in our room. We had 2 double bed in each room and there was just enough room for a small table with 2 chairs to go next to the windows.

In fact, even \"renovated,\" I would say it is a more of a 1.5 or a 1 star than a 2 stars hotel. Breakfast is just danish and coffee - and not very good, I might add.

Standard Danish and coffee breakfast. Requested non-smoking room, room reeked of smoke. Use Febreeze. Receptionist was having protracted argument with both customers in line ahead of me. Expedia had not forwarded their reservations. Instead of trying to solve this issue, she was sarcastic and very argumentative with them. When I walked up to her, her greeting consisted of \"What's your name?\" With no further word, she located my reservation, literally tossed my keys to me and disappeared into the back office. So much for a welcoming greeting. The room has a cube refrigerator (you defrost),TV, tub and shower, pretty basic Best Western stuff. The bed was made without a fitted bottom sheet. The maid used a top sheet for the bottom sheet (top sheets are smaller than bottom sheets). Naturally, whenever I rolled over the bottom sheet came undone and in short order wrapped around me. Impossible to sleep as everytime I rolled over I had to reset the bottom sheet. I mentioned this to the front desk the next morning and they said they would have the maid put a fitted sheet on. That evening I discovered she again used a top sheet and shorted the sheet so that a good third of the end of the mattress had no bottom sheet. I re-made the bed. Next morning, same promise. I asked to be given the bottom sheet, I would put it on myself. I was handed a mattress pad. I asked the receptionist if her life depended on it, could she tell me what it was. She said she did not know. So much for knowledgeable staff. She suggested that if I wanted a fitted bottom sheet I should go to Walmart and buy one. That's just what I did. On leaving I mentioned that I was really put off by the reception I received and the bed linens. The response I got was basically, \"Yeah, that's too bad\". Then inspiration struck: I told them I was going to review their hotel on Travel Advisor. Almost INSTANTLY the manager/franchise owner appeared. After listening to my concerns with an obviously well practiced show of well practiced professional sympathy he offered to take 10% off my bill, which covered the cost of buying a fitted bottom sheet. I asked him if he thought it was inappropriate for hotel guests to provide their own linens. He stated that \"No Best Western provides fitted bottom sheets\". Of course his statement is nonsense. In checking with Best Western's corporate offices they said each Best Western is individually owned and the bedding type is determined by each owner. The customer service rep seemed taken aback that they were using top sheets instead of fitted bottom sheets. The owner's explaination of the rude reception I received was \"Well, that's a good reason not to make your reservation through the internet\". Huh? I told him I made my reservation directly through his hotel and still received a rude reception. I understand it's not the Four Seasons, but his staff is still presumptively in the hospitality business, they just don't know this.

I didn't have high expecations, but it turned out to be a very comfortable stay. The room was very clean. It showed a little wear-n-tear, but not much. The TV worked perfectly, nice clear picture and the mini-fridge looked almost new. There was an attempt to have some attractive art on the walls. The bed - a king - was very firm and comfortable with three big fluffy pillows. The air conditioning worked well, and was fairly quiet. The water pressure was good and the showerhead was far enough up the wall that my tall husband could fit. (I hate the low motel showerheads!) Although there were noisy kids staying next door, once they were inside their room you couldn't hear them through the walls. There is a small table and two chairs in the room, so you can grab a quick bite, or spread out your laptop. The staff was friendly. The young woman working the desk when I checked in was very pleasant and professional. When I later came down for an extra towel, she cheerfully gave me a whole stack. I didn't take advantage of the free breakfast, but it's served daily from 6:30-9:30 AM. There is a small dining room just off the reception desk. There's also one outside table where you can sit and eat/rest, but it's right next to the entrance and a busy road, so I couldn't say it was scenic. The Inn was recently bought out by Best Western and there aren't good signs out yet, so it's easy to miss. I pulled into the Motel 6 next door by accident, and my husband, who came seperately, missed the entrance. The hotel sits right next to I-805, so it's very easy to get anywhere you want to go. Within a 5 minute drive away are a large variety of restaurants - mostly fast food and small local places - so there's no need to eat at the place across the street (which isn't so great).

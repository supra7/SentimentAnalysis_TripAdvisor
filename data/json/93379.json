As people have pointed out, the rooms are tiny, with little more room than the beds and wash-stand, but the lack of room wasn't really an issue. We had cable TV in the room, a sink/basin, a safe, and a dressing table, so didn't really need much more. The bathroom was directly across from our room, with another a few doors down, and we never encountered any problems with it (always clean, always one available, and if not then it's a short walk to the other corridor and their two bathrooms). The staff were very helpful, pointing us to a cheap dry cleaners down the road with one-day service, and the place itself was very safe (the location is extremely safe, so we never felt in any danger even when returning to the hotel at 5am on New Year's Day!). The main draw of the hotel is its EXCELLENT location, though. Located in the East Village, it is just a few blocks to Union Square, one of the main transportation hubs, and only a 30 or so minute stroll to Greenwich Village, West Village and SoHo. Staying here we got to experience what it's like to be a New Yorker, rather than just another Manhattan tourist. Staying in a place with this kind of a location is worth a crazy amount of money, and when you take the very reasonable price of Hotel 17 into account, it's a bargain!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "crawfishmedia", "ReviewID": "UR126555922", "Content": "In a quieter section of the lower east side, Hotel 17 is a european style hotel with a victorian feel.

The rooms have new sinks which is a nice touch to an history building. I recommend asking for a higher floor and/or a room not facing the street, it can get a bit noisy. I found rooms not facing the street are quiet. If you are concerned about shared bathrooms don't be, with 4 bathrooms(including shower) per floor, I was always able to get in. I found the bathrooms and rooms quite clean and the staff was quick to take care of towel refresh and cleaning bathrooms. If your visit to NYC is going to be spent mostly on the town, Hotel 17 will do just fine. Just a few blocks away you can get on the L to connect to uptown/downtown trains. If you want to save $ you can even take the L train to the A train to JFK Airtran, takes about an hour and only costs $7. Compared most Manhattan hotels, this one is an budget friendly option.

The hotel is super clean, as are the rooms, and because I travel a lot, I have seen my fair share of hotels. The beds are large enough, and very comfortable. The bathrooms are in fact shared, but whenever I wanted to use it it was empty. I think the highlight of the hotel is its location. It is is 2 blocks from Union Square, and we walked everywhere, only cabbing once. My favourite part of staying at this location was that we got to enjoy the real, less touristy New York. My acquaintances stayed at the Sheraton at Times Square, and they complained that they didn't really get the NYC experience because they were constantly surrounded by fast food restaurants and chain stores. Yes, the internet is slow, but I wasn't expecting to use it while on vacation, and coffee shops with wifi are close by. The only downside I can think of is that our room was slightly cold.

I found Hotel 17 through an Expedia search. The room was only $70 per night with due reason ... was a tiny about 6' x 12' room with a twin bed in it. I should have called the hotel directly to be certain of what I was getting - my particular room did NOT have a sink in it. It merely had a vanity, TV stand with a tube TV (I unplugged and never used ... had my laptop which was better quality anyway). Therefore, I had to use the community bathroom for EVERYTHING (brush teeth, face, wash hands, etc). The community bathroom was right outside my room, and I never had to wait to use it (felt very private). So, this was not a huge issue for me ... but would have been nice to at least have a sink (like the picture implied I'd have). My room did not have a safe in it. This worried me but nothing went missing. The doormen were always pleasant & they even let me check out late on my last day (regular 12pm check-out; I checked out at 3pm at no extra charge ... they usually do charge though 1/2 a day). The only thing that did really annoy me about the place was that their WI-FI is HORRIBLE ... Very spotty connectivity. And I was not the only one with issues ... people were having to step into the stairwell to try and have consistent connectivity. It didn't matter the time of day & they were not having specific technical issues ... they just consistently have bad Wi-Fi signal in the building. When you're traveling and trying to check-in on flights and buy tickets online for events - this is very annoying. I have an iphone, so I was able to do a lot on it - but that does run up data charges ... The location is convenient for subway travel (2 avenues over from Union Square) and close to yum, healthy restaurants (highly recommend \"One Lucky Duck\" at Irving and 16th). Overall - for the price, it was great ... a safe, clean room in NYC close to Union Square. I would though call the hotel directly before booking to request a room with a sink (worth paying a tiny bit more to maybe have that one perk :)).", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAffordable sleeping quarters to wake up in in the city that never sleeps!\u201d", "Author": "asteri_in", "ReviewID": "UR125109755", "Content": "If you are in NYC to explore and experience what it has to offer - you need not a better place to lay your head down at night. This was my first trip to NYC and though, admittedly, I was a tiny bit nervous about staying in the city alone and about an unwanted encounter with bed bugs, I felt safe in this neighbourhood and it gave me a flavour of what living in this city - bed bug free! - would be like. Hotel 17 is located about 3 short blocks east of Union Square, where the 14th Street-Union Square subway station is and numerous dining options are available. I made my reservation via their website and had requested a nonsmoking, single room with a sink, preferably on one of the higher floors. When I was checking in, the only room available with a sink was on the 1st floor, in a smoking section. I was quite hesitant about the smell of smoke but this ended up not being an issue for me at all (perhaps it was just luck). Being on the first floor had the advantage of reaching the room without the use of the elevator or stairs and the disadvantage of having a view of a wall of the adjacent building. The room I was in had a double bed, WiFi access, a TV, an alarm clock, a safety deposit box, a hairdryer, and a sink, as well as towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. I was located across the hall from one of the communal bathrooms, which I thought was very clean for a shared facility, and I never experienced having to wait to use it.

We noticed how very clean and intelligently utilitarian the room was (nice lighted clock, hair dryer, good shampoos), a little like the Yotel we have stayed at in Heathrow. The dark wood ambience in the evening had given a false impression of tiredness.The bathroom just across the narrow hall was immaculate and the shower excellent. The location of the hotel is very good (just off Irving Place, in Gramercy, not far from Union Square). The price ($121 per night all inclusive, or about 40 bucks a person) is excellent for a lodging this well located and fundamentally sound in expensive New York City (twenty five minute walk to theatre district, Trader Joe around four minute walk). Good restaurants nearby, including Brother Jimmy's BBQ and Irving Place Restaurant at no. 71; also good Chinese restaurant on corner nearby.

We went in well aware that we were paying significantly less than we would at other hotels. On the plus side, the location was fabulous, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the shared bathroom was very clean. But on the down side, our room was kind of depressing. It had peeling wall paper in several places, and there was a powerful smell in our room that was reminescent of strong soap. We figured it was probably carpet cleaner. It was very unpleasant and giving me a sore throat, but we were so tired we just opened the window and got extra blankets from the staff (who brought them up right away--like I said, very helpful!). I don't know if they would have moved us because we didn't ask, and the smell did not bother my partner as much as it bothered me, so this should be taken in perspective. It probably coloured my impression of the room and I didn't give them a chance to do anything about it. The towels are small and thin and I was a little uncertain about using the shared bathmat in the bathroom but there is no extra towel to use for that purpose, and no soap in the bathroom if you are just going to use the toilet; you have to bring your own with you and then back out again. These are little things and the hotel is certainly better than some we have stayed in.

Spoke to reception about it, who offered us the options of switching it off or moving rooms, but as it was pretty cold and we had good light (a rarity in the hotel as its deeper than it is wide, so most rooms have no windows) we opted with neither. Room wasn't massive (but only slept there, was out and about the rest of the time), but had a sink, TV, phone and safety deposit box (which was free to use).

They were very clean and I never had to wait, actually only a couple of times I saw somebody going there. The stuff was not the frendliest I ever met but they were ok, no complain about that. The hotel seemed to be busy, cause there were always people at the reception area when I would pass from there. No breakfast, but around the corner are a couple of 24h places where you can have full breakfast at reasonable price. The neighborhood is great, I loved it. Many bars, restaurants, mini markets and daily life shops in the area, where you mostly see locals and you fell like that. If you like a neighborhood that is not fancy, not trendy, neither shaddy or dangerous, but residential and still lively, where you mostly meet locals, you will love this neighborhood! Union Square, where is the closest subway station, is just 3-4 blocks away and Chelsea is a short walk. If you like walking, you can walk all over Manhattan from this area, I walked all the way down to the Financial district and also up to the Central Park, both are maybe less than an hour, perfect! What I didn't like so much, was that because there is no breakfast room or a bar or a lobby, you don't really have any interaction with the rest of the people staying there. If you like meeting people where you stay, that's not really the case here. Also the wi-fi was extremely slow, when it was there.

It had a great low price, and while the rooms were tiny and not very impressive (with a shared bathroom in the hallway) there was something cool about being there....but that hype has faded, and we're seeing it now for what it is-- a cheap hotel with small rooms and a shared bathroom in the hall. There's an old-school style elevator and the hallways are thin thin thin. A few of the rooms in the front look out at the street, with large brownstone-style windows, and you do get a feeling that you're right there, in NY, and part of it, in an exciting way. The wallpaper in the rooms is funky-- either striped or old-fashioned patterned, and the beds are small (some just single beds) and old and with charming but crappy little blankets. Sink in the room. The prices have gone up, but are still relatively low. The lobby is no more than a vestibule, and the vibe of \"we have to be careful of who we let come in the front door\" is palpable.

However, I just got back from a two night stay there and do have a few notable gripes: 1. Avoid a room on the third floor at all costs. The entire floor reeks of urine. The smell permeates the carpet and walls so much that when we woke up yesterday morning I felt as if I had slept in a dirty litterbox. I actually almost threw up. Now, you're probably wondering how I possibly fell asleep in the first place? Well, my boyfriend and I figured out that the cleaners must use some heavy duty deoderizer that masked the scent in our room for a while. The hallways smelled from the moment we arrived. Thankfully the morning person very kindly changed our room for the second night to the 7th floor and it was just fine with no smell just like all the other times I've stayed. The desk guy admitted that there has been a problem with a long term guest creating the 3rd floor urine smell...(I'm assuming he pees everywhere??) 2. Avoid the overnight desk guy. When my incredibly polite boyfriend asked if it was possible to have our room changed, the overnight desk man responsed with \"F*** You, your majesty!\" Really. My bf thought it was a joke, so he laughed, and the guy reasonded, \"No really, F*** You!\". My boyfriend then stupidly asked if this guy could recommend somewhere nearby for drinks and the guy (who is about our age, in his 30's) said, \"Why the f*** would I know? F*** you!\" and started slamming things. My boyfriend looked around to see if he was being filmed for punked or something. Absolutely insane. All the other desk people were helpful and did not swear.

I've stayed in B&B's and European hotels with shared baths before, and I can tolerate it if I have my own sink. I checked into the room, and found it larger than I expected, very clean, with a comfortable bed. It appeared to be recently renovated. It was only after I was undressed and unpacked that I noticed there was no sink in the room. There were 4 shared baths for the 16 rooms on my floor, but only 2 of the baths had sinks. At that point I was too tired to complain, so I went to bed. The next morning I requested to be moved to a room with a sink. I packed my bags and left for the day, and when I returned, I had been moved. I was very happy for the remainder of my stay. I never saw more than 2 of the 4 baths in use at once, and I always found the baths clean. They must be serviced several times per day.

I got used to the noise. If you are willing to put up with the shared bath, and want a budget priced room, I would highly recommend Hotel 17.

The show was announced in late fall and therefore the hotels I normally would stay at were unavailable. I didn't want to go the sketchy \"rent a strangers' apartment\" route and since NYC is pretty congested on that night, I was hoping to get something within walking distance of Irving Plaza. After fruitlessly searching on Expedia and other travel sites, all of which had nothing for under 400 a night, a friend clued me to Hotel 17 and I decided to take a chance on it because it had single rooms for about 150 and doubles for about 250. (I noted that I had to book right at the hotel website - the hotel didn't seem to come up in the searches on the multi-hotel travel sites.) I booked a double for one night with shared bathroom for a price of about 250 which worked out to 300 with fees. To be honest, I would have preferred the single room given that I wasn't going to be in it that much, but at the time I booked I was planning to bring a second person and this hotel has a \"no extra people after 10 pm\" policy. Unfortunately, Hotel 17 does not give you any discount when the second person decides to cancel out last minute (as happened to me), nor did they have a single room left to move me into, which was a bit of a bummer, but the 300 dollar rate was still better than anything else I could find for New Years Eve at that late date. I'd booked a \"no smoking\" preference but they put me in what appeared to be a smoking room - it contained an ashtray. Because the room didn't reek of smoke and was otherwise clean (I also had a stuffy nose from a recent cold so couldn't smell whatever smoke might have been there) I didn't complain or ask to be moved. However, people with allergies or sensitivity to smoke probably want to be more careful. Other than that, the room was nicer than I expected it to be. It had a vintage decor with retro old-fashioned wallpaper (appeared to be new paper in a vintage pattern, rather than old paper) and dark wood. All the fixtures and furnishings were in good repair - better than most of the chain hotels where I stay, and with the atmosphere of a small historic hotel. It was sort of like renting a bedroom in someone's old house for the night. Walls were not the thickest and at times you could hear the other guests (particularly the guy who had a little too much New Years fun and came back drunk and screaming at 2 am) but there are signs posted in every room to be quiet, don't slam doors, etc. and most of the guests on my floor were more polite. Although the room did not have its own toilet or shower, it did have a new-looking sink and vanity shelf with towels, shampoo, lotion and soap. Also a number of other amenities I was not expecting, including a decent TV, working in-room safe, extra pillow, digital clock, ice bucket and 24-hour room service provided by carryout places. I checked carefully for signs of bedbugs, did not see any. The \"double room\" basically means you get a double bed rather than a single, and all of the room is pretty much taken up by the bed, so it's about the size of a college dorm space. Not a problem since I didn't have a lot of luggage and all the time I spent in the room was pretty much spent laying in bed. The bed pillows and mattress were kind of hard but I could still sleep OK on them - wasn't expecting it to be the Ritz anyway. My biggest problem with the room was that it was VERY COLD. There was snow on the ground outside and the maid had left the screened window open to the outside air (maybe she was trying to get rid of smoke smell?). I didn't discover the open window for about an hour after I checked in because it was behind a blind and partly behind the headboard of the bed. I couldn't figure out where the draft was coming from, and by the time I found the open window, the room had gotten really, really cold and there was no room heat control to make it warm again. There was an in-room air conditioning unit for cooling but nothing for heating. The room warmed up later in the evening when the building heat apparently came on, but if you stay at this hotel in the winter, you might want to bring your extra sweaters. I also noted that the area around the vanity sink was carpeted which seemed like a mold issue waiting to happen, since the sink tap was quite powerful and would spray water out on the floor if you weren't very careful. Like most people, I was turned off by the idea of a shared bathroom (especially for 300 a night) but figured I could put up with it for one night. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the shared bathrooms on the first floor were nicer than the individual bathrooms I've had in a lot of other places. The tub, shower and tiling looked pretty new, no mold. The toilet appeared older and not as nice but it worked OK and I only had one issue when the person before me had not bothered to flush. I did not have to wait for the bathroom at any time, although I was careful to schedule my shower very early so I could get in there ahead of everybody else. One thing they could use in the bathroom is toilet seat covers - there weren't any so I used toilet paper instead. Of the two bathrooms on my floor, one did not have a sink so if I used that one, I had to go back to my room down the hall to wash my hands. The other bathroom was bigger and did have a sink in addition to the toilet and tub/ shower. I am not sure about handicapped access at this hotel. There's a big flight of front steps to get in and when I arrived there was a family carrying a person in a wheelchair up the stairs with seemingly no other way to get her inside. The shared bathrooms on my floor also required you to step up to get into them. Again, no problem for me, but if you have any sort of disability you probably want to check on that stuff before you book. The surrounding neighborhood is nice - lots of private residences, picturesque historic buildings, little restaurants (both sit-down and carry out), wine/liquor stores, delis, cute bars, some places to browse antiques. I felt reasonably safe walking back to the hotel from Irving Plaza late at night, and the hotel has a desk person on duty all night. Union Square with subway, park and more restaurants and chain stores is just a 10-minute walk away. Overall this was a much better experience than I expected for a \"shared bathroom\" hotel and I would definitely consider staying here again for an Irving Plaza show or anything around Union Square, although when it's not New Years Eve I would hope to pay a lower rate.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southport u.k", "Title": "\u201ca home from home in the cusp of the village!\u201d", "Author": "huffy72", "ReviewID": "UR89950355", "Content": "HOTEL 17! where do i begin, well i first stayed here in 2001,before the refurbsee woody allen film)it was cheap back then,and it still is now,so much ive been staying here once every 9 years now,the hotel is \"euro\" style,me being from here im used to sharing a bathroom,which are clean,and no lines,the rooms are basic,bed window(lucky if you have a street view,but can be noisy,due to traffic early)sink,hairdryer,soap,towels,radio clock alarm,basic cable tv,good for late night mnn cable shows!! firm beds,no bed bugs,clean,ice bucket?? well you have $$ left after the cheap rates! quirky elevator,even tho i got stuck in it once at 3am(blame the east village bars)clean hallways,friendly staff,there used to be some resident on the upper floors,one had a lovely small dog who would greet you,in the hallway,nice dude,the location is great,close to the\"L\" subway 2 stops to brooklyn,union squre is 5 mins walk away,styvesant square is a lovely small park,mumbles on the corner,nice eatery,local bars,great nightlife in the east village,the l.e.s is a short walk away too,deli shops have everything you need,i stay in the low season,january,$63 a night!! a steal,all i can say is,hotel seventeen is one of the cheapest budget hotels in new york,in a charming street,great neighbourhood,safe,and thats why i recomennd to friends around the world,and keeps me comming back year after year!! just booked for january 2011, enjoy!", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time at Hotel 17\u201d", "Author": "Jen_Jen_627", "ReviewID": "UR89878597", "Content": "My friend and I were on a limited budget, but we really wanted to stay on Manhattan.

This hotel is good for a very short stay. Both the nights the stay was short. For first night stay I checked into hotel at 6.30PM and checked our morning 5AM. Similary 3 days later I checked into this hotel at 7.30PM and checked out morning at 4.30AM. First night we got a room, wihch was clean and well maintained but very small. Not good enough for two people. Bathroom was very clean with clean towels, bath tub etc. The second time we checked in we got a room in 7th floor which was good for 2 people. This room was a little better and bigger than the earlier one on 1st floor. Final words, dont expect any great service from this hotel. This is nice enough for people who would like to roam around NYC attractions and who dont linke to spend time in the hotel. There is no breakfast available and you need to pay cash in advance to use phone from your room.

Ugly. This quad was smaller than the previous one we stayed in. I would recommend getting one of the quads facing onto 17St. The hotel needs to find a way to be more responsible environmentally. For convenience, we would leave soap and small shampoo bottles you leave in the hallway bathroom. But they would get quickly removed. We did try to carry soap and shampoos back and forth to the room, but that can get messy and annoying. Permanent soap and shampoo dispensers attached to the walls would be much better I think. I feel badly creating unnecessary garbage when visiting a place as of couse after I'm gone the garbage stays behind. Where does New York dispose of it's garbage? In the ocean still? When we got home, we noticed we all had bites on our bodies. Not having experience with bed bugs, we could only assume that was the source of the bites. Not a fun way to end a trip.

I took this room, because I was insistent on having a non-smoking room and it was worth it for me to not have the sink. A word of advice, if you have a request, like non-smoking room, try to arrive early or call them earlier in the day to remind them that it's what you want. One oddity: each floor has four bathrooms, two of which are larger and have sink and shower, toilet. The smaller bathrooms have a shower and toilet but no sink! How strange. I guess it's because most of the rooms have sinks in them. Inconvenient for me though!

So when you pair that with the lovely location (nice and safe & only 5 minutes walk from union square) it's a great base to explore New York. one tip though: If you're going there around September time prepare yourself for the very hot subway stations, we didn't factor in how humid and hot it would be (coming from Ireland) so we had to ditch all our jeans and buy light clothes!", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBook this hotel now!\u201d", "Author": "CockneyScouse", "ReviewID": "UR28472156", "Content": "location - downtown Manhattan public transport - Union Square is 5 mins walk (can get everywhere from here) room - clean, comfortable with a double bed, sink, tv and safe bathroom - 2 on every hallway but never had to wait for one and was ALWAYS clean definitely value for money for where it is!", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and convenient for the price\u201d", "Author": "MissSian", "ReviewID": "UR28415625", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here for five nights in March. It is definitely a boutique style hotel, the wallpaper in the room was definitely bright and it was quirky. We had a twin room which consisted of a double and single bed. My bed was comfortable but very squeaky, but the place was exceptionally clean. I was initally concerned about the shared bathroom situation, as all patrons on each floor have two bathrooms to share. The bathrooms were cleaned regularly and I did not encounter anything unpleasant at all - it is just important that you remember your swipe card as you would not want to lock youself out of your room wearing just a towel! The same went for the toilets, they were exceptionally clean. Our room had a TV, two large windows which opened up to air the room, an airconditioner which we did not use, a dressing table with large mirror as well as hairdryer, and small wash sink with mirror. Overall we could walk from the hotel to the subway in 3 minutes and could walk to Times Square in 30 mins. We walked the entire time and only used the Subway once and we saw everything we wanted to during that time, from Brooklyn to Greenwich Village etc. There are two great diners very near the hotel which serve amazing pancakes - an authentic American diner experience and a great way to fuel your walking each day. There are also some cute little bars very nearby as well. Oh just one point - I think other reviewers have mentioned this - internet access looked to me quite bad in the rooms based on seeing some people sitting in the stairwell with laptops so perhaps this is not great if you want to take your laptop along! All staff on reception were very helpful and even called the shuttle company to book my bus for me for my very early flight out of the US - this was only $15-20 and saved me lots of money on a taxi.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Sussex", "Title": "\u201cLone female travellers- excellent\u201d", "Author": "Kitty1975", "ReviewID": "UR28349769", "Content": "I stayed here in mid April 2009 and was not disappointed.

Similarly, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, and Herald Square (think Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade) are a pretty easy walk North.

The weather in NYC was perfect for sight-seeing. I was there all by myself and it was my first trip to NYC. I was a bit nervous since I'm a girl who's never been to the mainland of the U.S. and I heard that NY is very scary city for a young girl by herself. So i was really careful about picking up a hotel that i was going to stay. Of course I was a budget traveler since I'm a college student and i was looking for a cheap but nice hotel. I found Pod hotel, Chelsea Lodge, Hotel 30 and 17. All 4 of those hotels were located in good places and price were reasonable. But even though I tried to book a hotel on April, Pod hotel, Chelsea Lodge and Hotel 30 didn't have room since it was around the Memorial weekend. But fortunately Hotel 17 had room and the price was very reasonable for me. I checked the location in google map and I also mapped from both JFK and LGA to the hotel. It wasn't that far from both of the airports. Plus, I've booked 2 other hotels from expedia when I stayed in Hawaii and I really satisfied with those hotels, i had no doubt that this hotel would be suck. On the day of arrival, i checked my luggage in first, since it was 9 am in the morning. Check in was fast and easy compare to fancy hotels like Hilton or Ritz Carlton. It was just 8 min away from Union Square and near to main avenues like Broadway and Park Ave. Also it had a lot of good restaurants around there, so that i could have beer or wine in the night time near the hotel. But the problem was the hotel itself. I couldn't get to sleep 2 nights in a row. Some crazy people next door made noise all night long in the aisle. Damn it was horrible! I was so tired from walking around the metropolitan and I needed peaceful rest at least for 5 hours for the next day. I called the front desk for more than 5 times but it was just for that moment. Those crazy people made noise over and over again. It irritated me a lot. They were yelling at each other and kept slamming the door all night long, seriously. And do you wanna know worse thing than that? I went to the front desk after that first night and told them that I had trouble sleeping the other night and if it's happening again, i will call the police. And the person in the front desk made mock of me. His attitude toward thecomplaining guest was totally wrong. I got more angry after talking with him. I felt so frustrated. And the same noise making happened again. Also, the card key that they serve was so bad in quality. I tried to open the door for 15 min and it didn't work. So i went up to the front desk and changed the card key to total new one, but it didn't work either! I've had to change my card key 3 times. And whenever I tried to watch TV, it kept shutting down the channel several times. Maybe it was because of the weak signal from the station, but it's their problem. It was so horrible when they shut down TV for a couple of minute when the show was at the peak. But they had some good sides. Even though it's sharing bath for people who choose to stay on the floor which doesn't have private bath, it was clean enough not to make people feel gross about it. Besides the location of it and cleaness of the hotel, my experience in Hotel 17 was horrible.

(Had stayed in a much smaller room at a Comfort Inn during a previous stay in NYC). The mattresses were comfortable, the linens clean, the carpeting appeared newish, the in-room sink a bit cramped in its alcove. We had 2 large windows offering great views of neighborhood life. We needed to run the air conditioner the whole time, but it never got too cold-so don't know what it would have been like in the room if it was really hot out. Our big fear, the shared bath, was just a minor inconvenience. 4 rms shared 1 bath. Using the shower after 8 am might necessitate a short wait, but all in all, no problems. And as everyone has been saying, the bathrooms were immaculate, bright and newly tiled. Need to remember to bring soap/towel each time, not just for showering...

Thank God we brought our own pillows!! The room was really stuffy and smelled mildewy. It completely lacked any air circulation. We put the AC on from time to time, but the room definitely had a dankness to it. I would have prefered being able to open the window than the AC. Our room was fairly quiet, except for the banging pipes which seemed to happen just a couple of times during the night. It was very hot, particularly for April, and again...the bed was awful!!!! We stayed two nights and on the second night my kidneys didn't hurt as much as the first night. I also learned to stay on my back and not my side to avoid my shoulder going numb, but I don't know if I could have taken a third night...and I like a firm mattress.

Our room was spacious, with a double bed, vanity, sink, clock radio, phone, & a coat-closet like nook w/hangers. Our view looked out to other large buildings in the neighborhood. Normally the bed would be too hard for my husband but he was so exhausted every nite he didn't care. TV channels are limited. I know you get the local news, public access, TBS, & Bravo. It is not like a spa or resort (like the W down the corner), but was better than a lot of Ramada Inns/Comfort Inns I've stayed in. And the location can't be beat. The restroom was 2 doors down & always *immaculate.* By far the cleanest restroom I found in the city. I showered every nite & had no problem--although being on the 7th floor it did take a little while for the hot water to heat up (pressure was fine). There are 2 restrooms in the left wing & 2 in the right wing of each floor--so if one is occupied, there are 3 more to choose from. The elevator is old fashion, meaning it's also slow. So if you're in a hurry take the stairs. The halls are relatively narrow & dimly lit. Our room was decorated in golds w/green carpet & we were a little disappointed it wasn't as mismatched as the other rooms. The style of the hotel added to the experience for me. The front desk & housekeeping were always nice. The front door is locked @ nite & they buzz you in. The neighborhood is exceptionally safe, quiet, residential. It's around the corner from the police academy & the private Gramercy Park so I'm sure that has something to do with it. Hotel 17 is 1 block away from the Gramercy Cafe that is open 24hrs & has a great lox-cream-cheese-veggies-bagel sandwich. It is 3 blocks away from Union Square & the subway. It is a short walk to the East Village & Greenwich Village. The location is absolutely perfect for me. It caters primarily to European tourists. We ran into a lot of Germans in the hallway. We seen guests who were 20-somethings to 40-somethings. It also has some apartments, with their most famous resident being Amanda Lepore. (My husband ran into her.) The only draw back was no Wi-Fi, but if that means rising the price ($128/nite w/tax, off season) I can survive w/out internet.

Now, there have been a lot of comments about the slow lift, but if you have ever been to a hotel in Paris it's the same principle, slow...small but fine. you can walk down the stairs or wait a small amount of time. either way if you have physical difficulties of getting down stairs or are impatient to wait for the lift then hotel 17 isn't for you. the hotel room was fine. now it's not the ritz but neither for the money did i think it was going to be. what we got was mismatched wallpaper, a clean double bed, a sink in the room and lots of storage. perfect. the most annoying thing was the birds on the roof that loved to make a racket and you have your usual urban noises of traffic etc. the bathroom was always clean but at peak times in the morning it will be busy. my advice get in very early or shower late at night. but absolutely clean. top tips - gramercy cafe on 3rd ave is very nice and very reasonable for food. the tips i got for st marks ale house down in st marks is great for food and drink. thirsty scholar on 2nd a great wee bar. molly shebeen's packed, expensive for drink but very reasonable for food. pete's tavern expensive but beautiful. other top tips - take the subway. it's $2 and very safe. didn't use it at night but it's perfectly safe. i would advise that you study the line you need to use as there didn't seem to be many maps in the actual station. other tips- go see a knicks game. now they aren't the best team but the spectacle is out of this world and a great alternative. you can celeb spot and have a good night. beer is expensive tho. and take good shoes to walk in, cause you will walk miles!! for cheap shoes etc try union square DSW and filiene's basement. for a great book store barnes and noble on union square to chill grab a coffee and read! anything else just ask!", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cnormal\u201d", "Author": "Lidashka", "ReviewID": "UR13929690", "Content": "This hotel is great variant for its price.

Hotel 17 is in a great location for the subway and places to eat and its away from all the hustle and bustle in a safe area. To pick up on some of the things other people have commented on: 1) Yes the lift is a bit slow, but its an antique - and why is everyone always in a hurry. 2) The desk staff were generally very helpful, apart from one 'vacant' guy, but I guess some people aren't born with customer service skills - he needs to work on acknowledging people. None of them were rude though. 3) Bed bugs - load of rubbish, I saw no evidence of them. 4) Shared bathrooms were nothing to worry about as they were always spotless and there was always plenty of hot water even after everyone else in the building had showered. 5) The central heating - our room was always warm enough even when it snowed, there were only 2 nights when it was making a funny hissing noise, but not loud enough to keep us awake. If you're expecting the Ritz then you're going to be dissappointed, but I think its great value for money (about \u00c2\u00a3180 for 7 nights). Tips for food places - go downtown from the hotel along 1st or 2nd Avenue a few blocks and there's loads of places.

After a while he made a call to hotel 31 (sister hotel on 31st street) and said we could go there for the night instead. Again no apology. I asked how would we get there. He said we could hail a taxi outside. I asked how would we pay for the taxi. He gave me $5. It cost $8. Still no apology. A disgraceful experience all round.

I had never encountered bedbugs before, but I showed the bites to my daughter (whose apartment had been infested with them) and she made a positive identification: big red circles lined up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bedbugs walk along the body in a line, biting as they go.

The room while not huge, was pefectly adequate, with a comfy bed, and it was always warm enough. We slept really well, and the street was fairly quiet considering it was New York. Whenever we asked for help from reception they were always obliging and friendly. However, one warning....the hotel were keen to order us their \"car service\" back to JFK airport, as they claimed you could get over charged in a normal yellow cab. They quoted $56 for the trip, to include toll and tip. Their driver arrived on time, but he demanded money for the toll, and the bill came to $66! We argued that this was not the price quoted by the hotel, but he was having none of it, and I would not be surprised if this is a regular occurance, he was just lucky that we had enough money to pay him, but he was definately trying his luck!

The square is also an ideal starting point for getting uptown or downtown, either by foot, on bus, or by the Subway. I will definitely return to Hotel 17.

My previous experience of staying in NY was horrendous, so it was with a lot of trepidation that I arrived at the hotel. Past experience had let me to be very cautious about what you book on the net and what you actually get can be two completely different things. But not in this case. I was met with complete courtesy at the front desk and help with any queries. I liked this place as it had character and the fact that it could have been the set of some 1950's noir movie also gave it a bit of something extra (believe it was the set for a Woody Allen film as well), but I digress. The room we booked- a triple, was roomy had all the basic essentials, we had to share the bathroom and toilet with the rest of the hall, however we never had to wait and they were always spotless (a sink in the room proved very handy). The hotel was generally quiet, accomodating as we wanted to change our booking dates etc last minute and offered helpful suggestions of things to go see and do. The area is also quite handy, there are some great little restaurants (Joe Juniors Diner I think it's called is fantastic which is just around the corner) near by for food, as well as close to the underground, bars etc... I think you would be hardpressed to be anywhere in NY and not be close to a great bar/area anyways. The only thing that I would mention is the smoking areas in the hotel were a bit unclear. We had a non smoking room, however the hallway we were in did smell very strongly of ciggarette's and there were ashtrays placed along them. This did not bother us hugely, however I can imagine that this would be an issue for some people. All in all the hotel was a bit quirky in its decor, friendly in its service, and provided all the essential basics you look for in a hotel at a very reasonable price.

My mother and I booked a trip to NYC and Hawaii for November this year, spending 2 weeks in NY and 12 days in Hawaii. We decided to go budget in NY because everything was so expensive for what you got. A lot of rooms were booked out so the only option was a shared bath, which wasn't so bad anyway. Some people on this website are exaggerating, the staff are not ALL bad. When we arrived James was on the concierge desk and was so helpful and wonderful, and was the same for our entire stay. There was also another concierge who was wonderful, but I didn't catch his name. The hotel is quaint and cosy and very warm inside. Yes there is noise from the outside, but hello you're in NY - the city that never sleeps. I'm a light sleeper, so I just turned on the air conditioning unit at night to drown out any noise. This is what I had an issue with. On about the 10th night of our stay I realised that a pair of boots I had brought with me from Australia were missing. The boots were new and in a shoe box, in a carry bag. For some reason I had this feeling that the cleaners had thrown them out (this was despite very clearly separating the rubbish on one side of the room from the shopping bags which were on the other). It was almost midnight but I went straight down to the concierge and told him that I believed the cleaners had thrown my boots out. His response was basically, \"So?\". I started to get pretty agitated and demanded that he called someone to find out what had happened. His response was then \"it's midnight, there's nothing I can do. You will have to wait until the morning\". I told him that there was no way I was leaving until they were found and asked where the rubbish was. He called a staff member located elsewhere and then told me the rubbish was out the back but that nothing could be done until the morning. By this time I was getting rather angry and told him that the rubbish would be gone by the morning and so would my boots, that they were $600, new and that if they weren't found I would expect compensation. This STILL did not provoke a response. After about 15 minutes of this, I ended up having to demand rubber gloves and stood on the sidewalk (not out the back as he had said) rummaging through garbage bags. The concierge was \"kind enough\" to call some cleaning staff to point out which bags the boots could possibly be in. At no point did they or the concierge help, they stood and watched as I did this. It turned out that my boots were in one of the bags, along with a $30 Christmas card I bought at bergdorf goodman. Since returning I have remembered a few other things that I bought in NY that are missing. I have never been so humiliated or angry in my life. I never received an apology or anything but a bill from him or anyone at the hotel. I would never stay there again or recommend someone to stay there.

I would have to say both were ok; very good for this price range, frankly, I didn't know there were acceptable hotels in this price range in NYC. Now I have no excuse not to go. Hotel 17 is slightly better on most scores than Hotel 31. At 17 we got a room in the front, so we did hear honking horns, but not very many. The room was larger and brighter, I want to say the bed was bigger, there was a new air conditioner-useful even the first week in october-, the TV cable channels more interesting. All of these things are probably not worth the extra money if you must be very tight, but I think for me they were. The location is near lots and lots of shops, restaurants of the first order, and everything you go to NYC to do...for example a cab back from Chelsea or the West Village is about 6 or 7 dollars.

As a first-time New York tourist, I was a little worried about staying in such an inexpensive hotel. I expected filthy bathrooms, roaches and stained carpet \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as a best case scenario. From the moment I spotted the awning of the hotel on 17th Street, I felt comfortable, welcomed. The front desk staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a man named Raymond \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was friendly and accomodating from the beginning \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he even gave me a larger room than the one I had originally booked \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at no additional charge! The elevators were \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as many have noted \u00e2\u20ac\u201d incredibly slow. However, I just hoofed it up the stairs, which was always quicker in cases where luggage wasn't involved. My single room, which included a full size bed, night table, sink, cable television and desk, was cozy and more than sufficient. The bed was incredibly comfy, the lighting was warm and soft and the carpet was clean. Maid service was prompt and offered only on request, which was major benefit on mornings I needed to sleep in. The hotel is not your typical institutional, boring Days Inn. It's quite charming with lots of dark wood trim, antique wallpaper and light fixtures. Nonetheless, it's obvious improvements have been made in areas where the comfort of the hotel is concerned. The bathrooms (4 on each floor) were all modern, clean and had excellent water pressure. I never once had to wait for the shower and was shocked to find the bathrooms still spotless after a morning filled with showering guests. There must be a maid hiding in a closet up there! Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the hotel is the part of town in which it is located. Situated on a quiet street, three blocks from Union Square (and a major subway station), Hotel 17 is the perfect place to escape after a tiring day of running around the city. The area is residential (flanked by lots of neat brownstones and row houses), but offers plenty of cafes, shops and even a theater. Again, I can't say enough about this hotel. Even if I could afford a more expensive place, I'd still return to Hotel 17.

The clerk told me \"I've turned away lots of customers today, we are full, sorry\" (be lucky to have a room anyway). This room was very small (see photo) but I get a double room for the next 2 nights (without compensation for the first night of course). The double room is far more comfortable than the single. This hotel is very well located, you have 3 metro lines nearby, among them the green line (4,5,6) which runs manhattan from north to south. I find the room very calm and the bed was good, I've slept well (with earplugs). The bathrooms are very clean, and are cleaned regularly, even at night. I remember I have noticed someone had taken a shower at 10pm and the bathroom was clean again at 5am. What you might not like is the ambiance. The hotel is very dark. The lobby is in fact a corridor and the front desk is above you, you feel a little bit miserable as a first impression. There are no paintings or posters on the walls, no decoration, rooms and corridors are nude and quite old.

It seems to be going downhill. Good location, close to the mall and other necessities, and yes - affordable. BUT -Rooms are small -noisy -maids knock on your doors between 8:30-9:30 to do your rooms -\"free\"breakfast is low budget and of poor quality -daily parking fee of $8 -\"free\" wifi is bottom of the barrel - very slow -the wear and tear is truly showing on this place and aside from the \"new\" flat screen LG tvs..that's the most modern touch to the place. We were there on business/leisure. We reserved a king suite. Upon checking in we were given keys to a room..went to the room to get in and it was answered by people already occupying the room! The gal up front had written down the wrong room #. Then we found out it was the room next door (right next to the 1st floor exit doors and pool? No thanks.) Another associate resolved the matter for us and put us in a different room. Better location, but the carpet had a huge kool-aid looking red stain on the green carpet right as you walked in the door. Had reserved the room on our business card no problem. at 11pm (yes 11 PM) we get a call from the gentleman working the front desk - demanding other form of payment because our card was declined. Not knowing what the problem was, I assured we would be down to solve the matter. He insisted I give him new card information over the phone? (excuse me?) He was very rude and accusatory over the phone and we totally felt disrespected. My husband went down and gave him another card to use while we sorted out what the deal was on the business account the very next day...and carry on! This was definitely our last stay at this place.

We had a kids suite for $99 a night. We looked at probably 15 hotels in this area before deciding to try this one. We tried it because it had a pool/jacuzzi, free breakfast and a bunk bed that we knew our toddler wouldn't fall out of (the bottom bunk) vs. having his own taller queen bed. The suite was laid out a little weird: door, king bed, sliding door, kids bunks, slider then the bathroom. So if your kids are light sleepers you could wake them up if you need to brush your teeth or use the bathroom once they're asleep. But each area had a flat screen so two tvs would be handy if you had older kids that wanted to watch something different from mom and dad. We were first checked into room 321. the King bed felt like a trampoline, like something was broken. We were so tired after a long day at the zoo, we let it go. But then when we tried to run a bath for our kiddo, the water only came out at a trickle. It would have taken an hour to fill up the tub enough for a bath! I called down to the front desk and Surika was very nice to come up to take a look and she brought room keys for another room. We opted to move even though we had already unpacked, but the room was next door #319. This was a better king bed and a bath that worked, so that was better. Has a mini frig and microwave in the king room and coffee maker in the bathroom. The breakfast for me was overall a 2.5 on a scale of 1-5. I'd give it a 4 for options but a 2 for quality. They had limpy, greasy bacon and runny scrambled eggs. They did have 2 belgian waffle irons but the batter was tasteless. Cold options were hard boiled eggs, yoplait yogurts, cereal, bagels, bread for toast and an assortment of muffins and danish. They had whole and 2% milk, coffee, tea and very watery orange juice and cranberry juice. The second morning instead of bacon and eggs they had sausage links and tiny omelette patties. The sausages were fair, better than the bacon. They did have sugar free syrup and regular as well as peanut butter, cream cheese and honey as condiments, so like I said, the selections are plentiful for fueling up for a big day at Sea World just not fabulous quality. My son liked the chocolate chip muffins and fruit loops, things he would never get at my house! The first day the jacuzzi was broken, I was bummed. At 5 months pregnant, my tired feet were aching for a dip in the spa after all day at the zoo. The next day it was open again so at least after Sea World I got my wish. All in all, it was an okay stay for the price. I will warn, other reviewers are right. The pillows here are very small and square, even if they give you a lot. Hard to get the right arrangement for comfort when you're used to a king size pillow at home. Then linens were fair, I've had worse. Shower head was medium pressure, but plenty of hot water. Bathroom has 2 big mirrors and one sink. Grout near the floor was a little grimy. Towels were plentiful, the same course fabric as most hotels in this price range. Hotel is not on hotel circle where the other 2 comfort suites are, but just down one exit, still near the freeway. We asked for a room overlooking the pool away from the front, but at night with tv turned off we could still hear some freeway noise. Pool noise too until about 9pm when families go up for bed. Not a big deal for us. They charge 9 bucks a night for parking in their lot, but there is free street parking right in front, room for about 6 cars, we did this and had no problems. Benihana is a 2 minute walk next door which really hit the spot after a long day (just make a reservation in advance). The mall is just over the freeway so there are lots of shopping and restaurants to choose from. Took us about 8 minutes to get there from the zoo, took about 6 minutes to get to Sea World. So if you're looking for value for a family this could be your stop. The Comfort Suites Zoo/Sea World on Hotel Circle seems to be exactly the same, possibly slightly newer furniture in the rooms and were charging $119 for this exact kids suite room, so we opted to save 40 bucks on our stay and used that money for the overly priced lunch and gifts at Sea World, worked out for us. As other reviewers mentioned, housekeeping knocks early, so be sure to keep the \"do not disturb\" sign in the door to avoid this.

Well, I can't say enough about my stay here. I have been staying at ths Comfort Suites M-F for business for almost a year now. I have seen a tremendous transformation during this time from renevation, to services, to staff. And it has all been very positive. The front desk staff are always personable and eager to help. Sarica, Ashley, Divina always have a smile to share. Adam and Frederick are who I see at night after a day of business. They don't just hello in a passing fashion. They ask you how you are and how your day was. And even more important, they listen to your answers and boring stoires. Not an easy thing to do at 11:30 at night! The breakfast buffet has improved ten fold. I apologize for not knowing the lovely woman's name who has taken over this task, but she is doing a wonderful job. She's always helping guests and asking if everything is good for them. She works at such a frantic pace keeping coffee and juice plentiful, and keeping the buffet clean amongst the constant spills from us guests. And she always smiles. The housekeeping staff probably have the most thankless job of all. Well a warm hearted thank you to all of them. Everytime you pass them in the hallways they won't look away, or not look at you at all, they will say hello, and if the occassion arises, they will ask you if you have evrything you need. How nice. And the maitenance guys always give a wave hello...when their hands aren't full! The renevation of the hotel increased the visual appeal as well. And the rooms with new carpets, flat screen TV's, and wall paper, and wireless internet has made my stays even more enjoyable. The center point to all this improvement can be contributed to Elizabeth Ming, the manager. I have seen her involved at every stage of transformation this hotel has gone through in the past year. From the gardens, to the renovation of the building, to staff changes, she has been completely involved with every aspect of the hotels improvement. One thing that is small in the whole scheme of things, but in my opinion shows a great managerial decision, is the change in the parking permits that you hang from your car mirror. When I first started staying here, the permits were multicolored and glossy. Pretty to look at, but at what cost just to hang on your mirror. Well eventually, in a smart cost cutting decision (again in my opinion) was changing these placards to plain white with black print. That is looking out for the best interest of the hotel, and the guests. Great job! I want to thank each and every one for making my stay away from home, feel like home. You have my gratitude.

The lesson is, don't let distance be your deciding factor, turns out a lot of the area close to Seaworld is VERY shady (strip clubs, night walkers, adult shops everywhere), and this area didn't seem to suffer from that and because of the freeway, you get to the park extremely quickly anyways.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE!\u201d", "Author": "crzyblonde23", "ReviewID": "UR114629302", "Content": "We stayed here for a weekend.

Around 8 pm, a single man used his card key to enter our room while we were relaxing in our room. The man retreated and said he'd head downstairs to have his room changed.

The pictures of the room sold us....but I should have known better. The room we booked online was the family suite, and it appeared quite spacious. In reality, it was the size of a regular room that had a wall put up to create 2 smaller rooms, hence turning it into a \"suite\". Whoever took the pictures worked some magic to make it look much bigger than it seemed. When we walked in the door opened up about 3 feet away from the bed. The room also came with 2 TV's, one in each room. Unfortunately the TV's were located about 4 feet from one another which defeated the purpose of having them since you could hear one over the other even with the sliding door shut. The shower floor was old and stained and the tile floor appeared unfinished. Our biggest complaint however is the unbelievably bad customer services. Because we were traveling with an infant, we booked a hotel that provided infant cribs. Prior to our arrival I called as we were driving down there from Orange County (about a 90 minute drive) to ensure that the crib would be in our room when we arrived. The woman who answered the phone said she would have the crib delivered so it would be in the room when we arrived. Once we got to the hotel to check-in I asked if the crib had been delivered and her response was, \"You asked for a crib?\" I then followed to explain that I had called about an hour ago asking about the crib and showed her the printed reservation which showed the crib request. She proceeded to say they would send one up immeadiately. Thirty minutes after getting to the room, still no crib so I called down to the front desk and no one ever answered. This was after calling 3 times and letting the phone ring about 2 minutes each time. My husband then went down to ask where the crib was and again the person he asked stared at him like a deer in the headlights like she had no idea what we was talking about. Now there were only 2 females working that night and both were present when I asked about the crib 30 minutes before. Again they said they would send one and about 15 minutes later it was received with the attendant hanging around waiting for a tip. He didn't get one. The service was absurd and a far cry from what I expected having stayed at other Choice Hotels before.

Our room had two queen beds, two small chairs, a small table, a tv/dresser/microwave/refrig piece, and a wardrobe, in a very small room. The bathroom was equipped for handicapped, and there was no counter, no place to put your personal items except on the floor or the windowsill. The hand-held shower was broken; my husband fetched tools from the car and fixed it so we could stand under the showerhead. The bathroom was large to accommodate a wheelchair, but inconvenient otherwise. The room was dark, without enough lighting, and we could not open the draperies since the room faced the pool/spa and people were standing around outside our door/window from morning until 10pm. Breakfast was adequate, although seating was limited since there were many families there. Staff kept the food stocked and tables cleared. Bed was okay, although one sheet was torn. I asked the desk clerk at checkout if they always gave their third-party guests that room, and she said that to get a \"suite\" you would have to upgrade with the hotel; so basically, yes. It was okay since we didn't pay full price, but I find it offensive when a hotel advertises something that it does not give to all its guests.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Adequate\u201d", "Author": "nmwritergal", "ReviewID": "UR61141829", "Content": "Wow, people are awfully picky, complaining about square pillows, bitterness over the lack of weekday waffles, and the size of the room.

The location was OK - close to the airport, Sea World, SD Zoo, and the beach. There's also a shopping mall reallly close by, along with several restaurants. But here are the problems that I had with this place: 1. They advertise waffles for breakfast, but they didn't tell you it's only on Saturday morning. I originally picked this place over other comparable facilities is becaues of their advertised waffle bar breakfast. Their normal breakfast consist of toast, bagels, pastries, cereal, milk, OJ, cranberry juice, coffee/tea. On Sunday they add eggs and sausage patties. 2. The pillows and mattress were REALLY uncomfortable. My husband descrived the pillows as bags of giant cotton balls. For the king size bed, instead of the normal 2 king-sized pillows,they give you 5 square throw pillows. 3. The TV cable to the kids' room cuts in and out. We had to fiddle around with the cable to get a somewhat clear reception. 4. The front desk clerk was RUDE. She didn't even know their own Sea World fun pass promotion when I asked her and told us to call Sea World ourselves...umm, it's a special that's advertise on your website, hello!!! 5. The toilet did not flush properly. We had to hold the lever down for the toilet to do a complete enough flush. 6. The shower head was really sub-par. The water pressure was horrible, though the water stayed hot while all 5 of us showered or bathed. 7. The water in the pool was somewhat cloudy. My husband attributed this to the fact that everyone was probably wearing sunscreen, but I think it's just gross. 8. They charged for parking. 9. The wall/door did not cut the noise out.

The king bed was comfortable, but the murphy bed (pull out sofa) was not at all comfortable. The room was dated, carpet was loose and dirty, and the worse part was the smell in the room. The smell was a urine/mold smell that was bad enough to where it woke me in the middle of the night. Fortunately, I'd packed a bottle of Fabreeze and used it to get rid of the smell.

I originally researched hotels in the San Diego area long before our trip. This hotel had positive reviews, and the kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 separate room was a humongous bonus, it seemed. My 4-year-old could sleep on the bottom bunk, and his 2-year-old sister in a pack-n-play in the same room, while we (my husband and I) slept in the master bedroom. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I did my research well enough! While the price was doable (about $179/night), the room itself was awful. When I first walked in I immediately noticed how tiny the room was. I opened the main door, which immediately puts you into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153master\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bedroom. The bed took up practically the entire space. There was also an armoire with a tv on top, a mini-fridge, and I think a tiny microwave. There was practically no counter space to set things down, no place to set our suitcases without unpacking everything into drawers. Looking from the door, I could see through the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153master\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bedroom, into the kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, into the bathroom. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to go through the kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room to get to the single bathroom. Not so handy while kids are trying to go to sleep, or if you needed to get up before them. The door wall separating the kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room and our room was a joke. The curtains didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t block out any light, so we had to sit with all the lights off and tv off while the kids fell asleep.

Full kitchen, 2 floors, separate room upstairs for adults (and full bath), along with separate room downstairs with blackout curtains on door wall, and another full bath on first floor.

We drove to the area where our room was, and contrary to the review below (staying one of the same nights as us), this hotel is not in a bad neighborhood, nor did I feel like I was going to be jumped going from the car to the room. I actually saw more that one security guard on the lot. To get into the hotel, you must use your room key, and you can actually enter from the lobby if that makes you feel more secure. Yes there are trash cans located outside each corridor entrance with sand for cigarette butts, but in the 5 days we were there, they seemed to be kept clean. As there is no smoking in the hotel nor in most of the state of California, these types of trash cans are common pretty much in every city/hotel/restaurant that I have ever been to. While staying here, I did notice that there are several layouts to these rooms. Some with the pull out bed first, some with the bathroom in the back. When you entered our room, the bathroom was immediately to your right, the main bed next, and the extra room/pull out bed behind a sliding door. The A/C is located in this room w/a fan between to pull the air in. The A/C was not noisy, it was very efficient and the fan was fine.

The prior reviews were accurate, but that does not necessarily mean you should not stay here. 1)Parking-As opposed to other hotels in San Diego, parking here is free. The spots surrounded the building, there were quite a number of spots, but still I wonder if one would get shut out if one arrived real late at night. We got back late a few times, did find a spot, but we had to back in , as the spots were tight. If you are a good driver, are adept at backing into a spot, then you will be OK. So, parking is free which is a positive. 2)The breakfast is typical Choice Hotel breakfast, cereals, bread, danishes, juices, coffee and this hotel even had hard boiled eggs too. Aside from the indoor breakfast room, there was an outdoor eating area also. We were earlybirds, so we were able to get an outside table each morning. I don't know why anybody would knock the breakfast at this hotel, it was fine. 3)Location- This hotel was one of many hotels that were near each other. A reference to the AAA Tour Book spotting map will show that there are many hotels in the vicinity. I found the location of this hotel outstanding. It is actually on the service road of one of the freeways. This hotel is centrally located as it is near 3 freeways concurrently. We went to : Wild Animal Park SD Zoo Seaworld Balboa Park Museums SD Airport The Wild Animal Park is a bit of a ride North, but the other places and Airport are minutes from the hotel. In addition, we were not real far from downtown, and visited the shops along the harbor. The entrance to the freeway was just a few blocks from the hotel, what more could you ask for? 4)Movie charge: I just reread one of the reviews before I wrote this, and was incredulous that I had the same thing happen to me. The night before we left, I channel surfed for a few minutes while my wife was packing the luggage. When I got the bill the next morning, there was a charge for a movie. I told the girl that I did not watch a movie, I just channel surfed for a few minutes. She asked if somebody else was in the room with me and I told her my wife was , but she never even touched the TV. She eventually took the movie off the bill, but it took a few minutes to get it straight, and I had a plane to catch at SD Airport. I was not thrilled that I was even doubted. 5)The room itself: decide for yourself: As mentioned in prior reviews, this really was 1 room and a partial wall was installed to make 2 separate areas. You come into the room, and the sleeping area is first. The air conditioner is in the next section, not the section that you sleep in. To circulate the air, they installed a fan IN the wall separating the 2 areas. The fan is by BROAN, the range hood people, and the sound is identical to the sound that your range hood fan makes. We spent each day we were in SD out all day long, and did not return until dark. Entire days at Wild Animal Park, LegoLand, SD Zoo, Museums, Seaworld, so we were pretty tired by the time we got back to the hotel, showered and went to sleep. Somehow, that fan did not bother us and we slept well each night. So, if you can handle a fan whirring over your bed, it will not be an issue, if you are a light sleeper, you will have a problem. There was a desk to work on next to the A/C, so you froze while working at the desk. The cold air did not seem to come into the sleeping area, fan and all. Still, we were able to sleep. Conclusion: You need to decide what is important in your life. I liked the great access to several freeways. I liked the breakfast , it was fine. I liked the free parking, if you found a spot, and know how to back in you will be fine. The place was secure as your plastic room key got you into the outside property doors as well. The hotel was reasonable priced. If you just need a place to have breakfast, sleep and shower you will be OK with this hotel. Downside: The room is claustrophobic as it is real crowded with that wall more a hindrance than a help. I was in an Embassy Suite and that is really a Suite. This may say Comfort Suite, but I do not agree, this is not a suite, simply a room with a wall that divides one room, doing more harm than good. I called Choice Hotels and stated my displeasure with this setup, and the girl told me many of the Comfort Suites are like this. I will make it my business to stay in a regular room next time. I will not turn my back on Choice Hotels, as I have been happy in many other properties that I have stayed in. I once stayed in a Clarion and it was magnificent, and I once stayed in a Sleep Inn that was fabulous. You must really do some soul searching about this particular property, to see if you can deal with a fan over your head while you are trying to sleep.

All and all this place was adequate, nothing fancy but, good for the money.", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton CA", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as the pictures look\u201d", "Author": "mama_goat", "ReviewID": "UR5011916", "Content": "We found this hotel through the AAA Tour Book, which showed a really nice picture of the room with a french door. Well, I second the \"Extremely Disappointmented\" reviewer's sentiment, that it is a bitter disappointment if you believe that picture. Everything the reviewer said was right (I just wished I had seen it before I booked!), and even though they say that breakfast is complimentary it is actually included in your room rate (try reserving for fewer number of people and see the difference in price), so you are actually being charged for it. For the breakfast, the food is continental, the breads are old, but it is convenient if you have a full day of itenerary, and the breakfast room is brightly lit and cheerful. The room is very small, I estimate that the entire area for the suite is probably around 14x30, or slightly smaller, so you can imagine how small each room gets when you section them off into 3 rooms -- the bathroom, the bedroom and the sitting room. Air-conditioning is loud and old, and if you are a heavy person you can feel the springs through the sofa bed, but our toddler slept okay on it. One thing that really annoyed me was that they separated the two rooms with a french door, but not quite enough, because the curtains on the doors are see-through viels, so when my son went to bed, we couldn't just close the door and do whatever we like on the other side, we have to turn off the lights from the other room as well, and go hide in the bathroom. For us this completely defeated the purpose of getting a suite, because we couldn't even watch TV. On the plus side, they do provide free internet access, which is nice, but you have to bring your own computer. The jacuzzi and swimming pool look really nice, in an outdoorsy garden setting, and seemed very popular. On the day that we were checking out, we got a bill that showed that we had watched two movies. When we called the front desk to tell them that we absolutely did not watch any movie during the stay, the manager called back and cited that we have watched 2 movies, and he cited a time that we were all in the room, watching ABC together. When I told him that there had to be some kind of mixup in their system, instead of apologizing he said \"Alright, I'll adjust it this time\", making it sound like we were culprits and he was just letting us go easy. I feel that if this happened to us, it must have happened to hundreds of people before us, and if they haven't done about their system, well they never would. I will never stay there again.", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood, Clean Hotel w/ Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3880921", "Content": "I really don't understand all the negative comments about this hotel. I have stayed in many, many hotels and motels throughout my life (I used to be an Events Planner for an Internet Company) and I can honestly say that this hotel is nice, for the price range and type of hotel it is. My daughter, mother and I stayed in this hotel for three nights, arriving the first night around 8:30pm. The lobby is very nice- all marble floor, nice designs on wall and a cute fireplace (I think faux-fireplace). I'm always a little leery of night-staff as they tend to be less accomodating and pleasant. However, this was not the case. When I walked in, there was a line of one person with another person at the desk and one staff person helping the guest at the desk. After a minute or so, the staff person, looked directly at me and said that he would be right with me. It did take some time to get waited on, but he was certainly going as fast as possible with each guest while still giving good customer service. When he got to me, he was very pleasant and helpful. We had a family suite- a main room with a second room with a sofabed separated by french doors. Yes, the room is ont he small side, but really, I've stayed in smaller and paid much more for it. The bathroom was nice with a long counter and the shower and toilet were clean and stain-free. The only downside was our room was at the end, next to the door that went out to the parking lot, so we had door noise and people noise, but again, nothing too unbearable and anyway, it was certainly not anything the hotel could be faulted for. The hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast every morning from 6-9:30am. Very nice, not extravagent, but there were 4 cold cereal choices, instant oatmeal, bagels, bread, pastries. muffins, apples and oranges, milk, coffee, hot chocolate, 2 kinds of juice, a microwave, two toasters and butter and jam. I had several occasions to talk to the front staff and each time it was someone different and each time, they were pleasant and helpful. When we called to request two extra blankets, they arrived within 5 minutes. ON the 2nd night, we arrived late back to the hotel and there were no parking spaces, so the front desk person told me to park in their red zone right outside the lobby overnight. No muss, no fuss. I would certainly stay there again. By the way, they have a very nice pool and hot tub and provide towels right at the pool.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fountain Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cComfort Inn- Camino Del Rio South\u201d", "Author": "hspandorf", "ReviewID": "UR3748836", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel August 2005 for 5 nights.

The few criteria I was looking for was a kid suite type room, complimentary breakfast and free parking. We were only staying 3 mights, so I took a chance. I booked a kid suite room, which has the bunk bed and queen bed with sliding french doors separating the two rooms. Yes, its true it wasn't the biggest of rooms, but the bunk bed and their own TV was a hit with my kids (ages 7 and 4). I've seen better complimentary breakfasts, but all my kids eat is cereal, anyway, and my husband and I were ok with the bagels. I thought the room was clean and the bathroom was larger than I expected. If you are expecting 5 star, don't come here...but my kids loved the pool, which wasn't crowded the time we were there, they loved their bunk bed and their own TV. I also noted the housekeeping staff actually said \"Hello\" when you passed them in the hallway. The location was also great. We spent the day on Coronado Island and it took all but 15 minutes to get there. The Target and the large shopping mall was across the highway from the hotel. So all in all, I would recommend this hotel for families with young children.", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Augusta, Ga", "Title": "\u201cHas its ups and downs\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3341133", "Content": "For the price, this place was good. We stayed here for a conference, thus we were on a budget. The breakfast was basically what was shown in the photos on the website- some fruit, cereal and pastries (bagels, danishes & muffins) and it saved us from buying food at the Convention Center. The positives: the room had a micro and fridge (although the fridge didn't work well), the AC in the room worked very well. The housekeeping was very good (they kept the room clean for us). I did notice a musty smell in the room when we turned the AC off for long periods of time, but the smell was gone after running the AC for a few minutes. And price- this place was a lot cheaper than the others that I called. Negatives- it is a mile from the nearest trolley station. We asked the clerk at the desk before we booked and he made it seem like the trolley was just over the bridge near the hotel. This was completely wrong. It is a pretty good hike. So if you plan on using the trolley- this place may not be your best bet (maybe try the DoubleTree at Hazard if you want to be near the trolley).", "Date": "April 7, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Suites Mission Valley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80004-Reviews-Comfort_Suites_Mission_Valley-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$108 - $148*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">631 Camino Del Rio South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "80004", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/21/71/2f/comfort-suites-mission.jpg"}}

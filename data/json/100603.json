Check-in after 11pm is ALWAYS a painfully slow process. The man who handles the front desk (Keith?) can't seem to locate a reservation, scan a credit card and get a key handed out in less than 5 minutes (or at least it seems that long). I have seen some improvement over the past 6 months or so but it is still slow. My last two stays I had no acknowledgement of my Diamond status, or welcomed back, or any of the \"extras\" such as bottled water and cookies. The service does not compare well with other Hilton properties I have stayed at. The property itself is a \"standard\" Hampton Inn: Clean, comfortable, predictable. The location is on the Airport side of the road and can be noisy if you are on the runway side of the building. The biggest issue is a late check in. Since I am usually just passing through, coming in at 10:30pm and leaving at 5:30 am, any delay has an impact. It will take the shuttle about 15 minutes to reach the airport although the trip to the hotel is just 5 minutes. When you add the length of time it takes to check in after 11pm, it can be 30-40 minutes from curb to bed. The Hilton and the Doubletree are closer and seem to have shuttles more regularly so you may want to check the pricing between the properties and choose accordingly.

I am a very frequent traveler, at least 70 nights in hotels in 2008, and I advise: Ignore the negative reviews of this hotel because apparently the hotel has been renovated: my room looks sparkling new and is VERY quiet. Specifically, I cannot hear any sounds whatever coming from other rooms (like people taking showers, bathroom exhaust fans, and the usual annoyances that I usually hear in any hotel). Special mention of the heating/ cooling unit that is over by the window. Wonderfully, it is usually OFF yet it keeps the room at the right temperature. It just comes on a couple of minutes every hour or so; and I can adjust it up or down as I please so the temperature feels perfect for me. At many hotels, even very expensive ones, they have an exhaust fan running all the time, or the unit is always \"on\" with a fan, and this is incredibly annoying. Whoever designed this hotel's renovation should be hired everywhere. I can see part of the airport runway from my room, yet I can't hear any planes taking off our landing. This room is quiet, Quiet, QUIET. I got curious and read the notebook in the room about local restaurants and so on (there are a few nearby). And in reading about the hotel, I see that this hotel has a \"honeycomb\" construction which the hotel modestly claims is one of the \"quieter\" hotels by the airport. I am not sure if 'honeycomb' refers to the kind of insulation in the walls, or the form of the construction, though to me (I knocked in the walls to check) it feels like the walls of my room are made of solid concrete. In any case, this room is so quiet, and that made for some very peaceful rest! I would add special praise for the nice woman who answered the phone when I called from the airport to request the shuttle, and who checked me in when I arrived. She was a true professional and so kind and courteous. Do not expect the other trappings of a luxury hotel (besides the nice room like the one I have). This is a budget hotel: the lobby is small and not for lingering, just for getting checked in, the free hot breakfast is fine to take care of the needs of a family feeding their kids, the pool is tiny (and outdoors, so forget about that if it's not summer), and the exercise room is tiny. But in my opinion, this hotel is an outstanding choice for a peaceful overnight sleep just a short ride from the Seattle airport. I know this review sounds like a wild rave.

The housekeeping staff are absolutely wonderful. The rooms are clean and the breakfast meets the Hampton Inn standard. The check-in was very disappointing, it took an extremely long time.

She was clearly getting frustrated at the computer and communicating with her co-worker in a manner that I would consider unprofessional in front of a guest. I was asked what floor I would like to be on so I selected the highest floor. However, she failed to advise me that there was construction on that floor and my room was about 1 of only 2 rooms on the floor occupied and that all around me would be construction. I had to climb over construction debris just to get to my room...literally....CLIMB! The worst part was that it was late afternoon and I had a dinner engagement so I wanted to nap so I could rest up. Unfortunately, it was next to impossible as the sound of table saws and other construction noise could be heard all around. At the end of the day, all of the debris was cleared out of the hallway but the construction started early again the next morning. Lucky for me, I had to be out of the hotel early. What disappointed me however is that despite the debris being cleared out of the hall, there was still saw dust and bits of dirt right in front of my door! Nobody made an effort to even vacuum the entrance ways of the rooms that were occupied. As a result, I ended up dragging in saw dust into my room! Upon check out, nobody asked how my stay was and what frustrated me even more is that the agent automatically put all of the charges straight onto my credit card without reviewing the bill with me or giving me a choice of how I would like to pay. Typically, I find Hampton Inns to be very good but I was very disappointed with this property. To make matters even worse, I wrote a complaint to the property via the Hampton website.

We had stayed at the hotel before and had a good experience. The hotel has ample free parking and the hotel lot feels safe although it is not gated. We parked very close to the front entrance of the hotel which may have contributed to our feeling of safety! Check in was a breeze. The clerk also offered a list of local dining locations and said that the on demand shuttle was available to take us anywhere on the list. Our room was spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. the king sized bed was incredibly comfortable with very soft linens and good pillows. We noticed some TV noise from an adjacent room but it didn't disturb us. The hotel offers an outdoor pool, fitness center and continental breakfast. We didn't make use of any of these, but noticed that the breakfast included some hot items (sausage, eggs and biscuits on the day we were there) as well as the usual doughnuts, cereal, yogurt and toast. They also pack items into \"breakfast to go\" bags that you can grab on your way out. No idea what's in there, but seemed like a great idea for travellers! The on demand shuttle was great. We returned our rental car the night before our flight and the driver came and picked us up at the off-airport rental location within a few minutes of our call. We used the shuttle to get to the airport in the morning and it was prompt and efficient as well. You can't reserve the shuttle, you just go to the lobby about 10 or 15 minutes before you need a ride and it works pretty well. We had to wait 5-10 minutes for the van to return from a trip but since we had allowed for that we were not late.

At check-in was given password for complimentary internet. Went to dinner with friends at a nearby place. Came back around 10pm and did some ironing before settling into bed. The room itself was a pretty decent size and bed was comfortable. Woke up around 4.15am and took a shower, the toiletries were standard HI affairs and not too bad.

We took a walk over to the park and there was \"Shakespere in the Park\" going on, with a huge crowd, and a beautiful lake just beyond.

We rented our car from Enterprise and it was just about 1 block away so quick access to drop off and back to airport if you catch an a.m. flight. We paid $119 on internet rate for family of 4.

First of all, this is an airport hotel. So expect plane noise. The location is to the side of the runway a couple blocks away so planes are not taking off/landing directly over the hotel. SEATAC is not too busy an airport, however, so there is minimal activity between 1am and 5am. The room walls are concrete which helps minimize the noise. I agree that this, or any other airport hotel, would not be the best choice for light sleepers. I requested a quiet room and therefore got one on the road side, farthest from the airport, on the 4th floor. Checkin: Front desk staff was OK, but lacked some knowledge and were not very fast compared to my favorite Hampton Inn in the Seattle area, the Hampton Inn Southcenter. I agree with the comment that they might be overwhelmed if there is more than one or two people waiting to checkin. One error is that they did not know if the parking lot on one side of the building could be used by hotel guests or not (it can't). There is a roving security truck trying to catch people, so be sure you do park in the right area. Second, they had slight trouble dealing with my credit card, trying to figure out my name vs. my company's name on the card. That's unusual. I think they were just inexperienced. They were very polite. They offered a list of restaurants, and will shuttle you to some of them with their free bus. If you have a car, I recommend the short drive to Southcenter Mall area. Room: Nicely furnished, generous size (possibly due to end of hall room), decorated in dark wood tones. Bedding is recently updated and was comfortable. Desk/desk chair, recliner easy chair. Plenty of pillows. Standard Hampton Inn setup. Bathroom was nice, no mold on tub caulking, plenty of light and mirrors. All facilities functional no issues. Oh, I did have one light bulb that was burned out, but didn't stay long enough to see if they would fix it when I left the burned out bulb on the desk in the room. And speaking of bulbs, they use standard bright ones not the energy saving, dim, compact fluourescent ones. That's a plus. Not sure if they have the mini-fridge/microwave like over at the Southcenter location. I requested one on my reservation and didn't get it, and the checkin staff didn't mention it. I didn't ask since this was a short trip. Another poster mentioned no closet - that's true it is an armoire/cabinet, which is OK by me. I do find a bit bothersome that the hangers are the security kind which can be inconvenient. Another poster mentioned about the power outlet. This was actually not a problem in my room - better than average. The desk lamp had a dual outlet so access for laptop and cellphone simultaneously w/o crawling around on the floor or rearranging furniture. Smoking observation: I noticed that the 4th floor is a combination of smoking and nonsmoking rooms, so the hallway smelled as a result. In the Southcenter Hampton, the 4th floor is entirely nonsmoking which is much better. My nonsmoking room in this hotel did not smell of smoke, however. I'm not sure if they have any entirely nonsmoking floors in this hotel since I didn't ask them. Fitness center: I used it and it's small but nice. One treadmill (wish there were two since that's the one item most people want), one stepper, one bike, one four-position multigym. Outdoor pool: Didn't use it or see anyone using it. I'm not sure if it is heated like the one in Southcenter. General area: Safe enough, fast food joints, other hotels, remote parking lots for the airport. One nice thing: there's a lake park right across the street - didn't have time to check it out but it looked pleasant for a walk. Breakfast: Hostess gets extra high marks. Very friendly, keeps the area clean, stocked and ready to go very early (I showed up at the advertised start time of 5am and everything was in place). The free breakfast is to my liking. Extended continental with one or two warmed up hot items (scrambled egg patties, canadian bacon), varies by day. Breads, cereals, fresh fruit, juices, etc. Coffee and tea are always available in the lobby, as are bananas and apples - good to keep the traveler healthy. Lobby has one public computer for people to check their email and so forth. That is a handy item and something missing at the Southcenter Hampton. I use my own laptop, though, and wireless internet is free for hotel guests and works very well in the rooms and lobby areas - very important to me in my work. Overall, it's a good place for the price, averaging around $100/night before taxes during peak weekday times. And of course, this is a per-room price, which makes it more attractive for families, all of whom get that nice free breakfast.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cDon't expect much except for free shuttle\u201d", "Author": "jcniii", "ReviewID": "UR5351892", "Content": "My tag line says it all...If you don't care listening to planes landing and taking off all night or a room without a true closet then this is your place.

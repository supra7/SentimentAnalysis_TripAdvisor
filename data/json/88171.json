Henry brought us china and flatware so we wouldn't have to eat using plastic flatware and Styrofoam boxes. We were told it wasn't his responsibility to assist us, but he brought our food out to us and provided plates, glassware and flatware. He even provided us with Tootsie Rolls for dessert. Henry truly went above and beyond to make our luncheon experience in the courtyard a memorable experience. Henry is truly an asset to the Marriott Indianapolis East.

The hotel was under construction, the atmosphere was less than desireable for the price you pay per night. Due to the construction conditions, they should have a discounted rate per night. At $169/night you somewhat expect good treatment. My family and I stay frequently at hotels throughout the Indiana & Michigan area so I do know something about hotels. I was appalled at how we were treated. We arrived at the hotel late, warning...don't do that! The night crew at the front desk was not courteous or willing to help at all. I was like we we were bothering them. Hello...by staying at their hotel, they have a pay check, couldn't they be nicer? We weren't rude! We could have stayed somewhere else! This was our first time at this hotel, we needed to ask some questions regarding the amenities this hotel offered, the front desk clerks were extremely rude. The night bellman was very helpful and showed us around. We ate at the restaurant, which was just a make-shift restaurant stuck in one of the banquet halls. The atmosphere wasn't pleasant, however, the food was excellent. Another thing, we had to pay for internet service. What! Yes, we had to pay $10 for internet service. This was absolutely ridiculous, other hotel's offer it free. At check out, the day front desk clerk and the day bellman were very nice and helpful.

This Marriott caters to conventions and meetings so it is usually pretty crowded, especially in the day time. As several people indicated the hotel is under major reconstruction causing some difficulty with entering the hotel. The management has set up a temporary check-in desk and the restaurant seems to change to a different location each day. The biggest problem with the reconstruction is that there is no signage directing customers to where to check into the hotel. After arriving to the hotel I had to call the hotel from the parking lot to ask where to check in to the hotel. Because of the numerous meetings the parking lot is usually very crowded making it difficult to find a parking space. The hotel is in a perfect location with free parking and numerous restaurants are nearby. The employees at the Marriott are very helpful providing directions and offering suggestions for dinner. When checking in I was offered a suite in the newly renovated tower section of the hotel. However, since this is away from the Club Lounge, I decided to stay in the older section of the hotel that has not yet been renovated. The room was dated, but the trade off was not having to come down the elevators and walk across the hotel for the evening refreshments or morning breakfast. I do think the strength of this hotel is it staff. They are very helpful providing information about local restaurants and other attractions. When leaving the hotel, the manager took time to provide me directions out of the city where I would encounter the least traffic.

Construction seemed to affect too much of the hotel and was not mentioned anywhere on their site. I booked the room last minute using Marriott Reward points and it just was not worth the points with the issues we had. Pros: 1. Marriott Pillowtop bed and bedding are always great. (Murphy bed is not a marriott bed) 2. Liked the shower (all tile and really low entry level) 3. Flat screen TV's in the suite Cons: 1. Construction going on which seemed to affect everything we saw. 2. Guaranteed a 2 double room but one of the beds was a Murphy bed which was not mentioned at check in. Sounds like thats all they had. 3. Check in was a temporary counter which looked very UN-Marriott. 4. No C-lounge on weekends and had to ask for the breakfast benefit (pro: which they happily provided) 5. Toilet didnt flush. The chain fell off inside. I fixed with a paperclip instead of waiting on maintenance as it was very late. 6. Murphy bed foot support swings down but one side was not attached. Again, just made it work instead of packing up the family at such a late hour. 7. Connecting room on both sides. Never seen that before... 8. Breakfast was setup in a conference room. Also temporary because the restaurant was closed for construction and not very good quality. Service was great. Bottom line is that the hotel is mainly a meeting and convention center and staying there during meetings would be understandable. The stay was not horrible and I have to imagine that it will be better after construction is completed. The bed provided a good nights rest.

We stayed while hundreds of high-schoolers were here and had to step out of the room early in the morning to ask them to keep it down as they were SO loud in the halls and their room, and the doors and walls are thin. If we were to stay here again, I'd request a room at the end of a hallway. We had one issue with a slow-draining shower the first morning that was fixed by the engineering team immediately.

We ordered room service one night and the lady demanded payment immediately which was not a big deal. However, she didn't have change so I gave her $30.00 and she stated she would leave the change at the front desk. The next morning, I went to the front desk and she had kept $5.00 for herself. She didn't leave any change at the front desk nor did she even turn the ticket in to the front desk. It's as if I never ordered room service.

They did accomodate me with one of the rooms available with their new massage chairs and that was great! On checking in we had to dodge a couple dozen drunken American Legionnaires but this was no fault of the Marriott. The value was O.K. but I would definitely spend my money across the parking lot at the much newer and nicer Fairfield Inn.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHated it\u201d", "Author": "ficoguy", "ReviewID": "UR3743446", "Content": "Well, they have these air conditioning units on the wall, the kind that you find in a Motel 6 - they are supposed to be thermostatically cpntrolled, but they aren't.

The room never got below 84 degrees. One morning, they forgot my room service order - I'm waiting patiently, finally call, and thet say they never got it ( it's the kind you ahng off the door ). They did nothing to resolve or address the room temperature conditions, because they were sold out. They did offer to send up a fan, so I could move the hot air around and have even more noise. This place must be very old, because there is no HVAC system on the rooms - only the Motel 7 wall units. What a nigtmare. I checked out a day early and went home.

I found the hotel to be okay, but service was so-so, and the stay did not live up to my hopes. First, I arrived with a confirmed reservation for a room with king bed. I was assigned a room with two queens. I came from California, so this was a bother at the end of a long travel day. (As an aside, the hotel is hard to find at night when coming from the east, another bother at the end of a long travel day.) Then, however, I was \"upgraded\" to one of the so-called Concierge Floor rooms. That should have meant the lounge on the 4th floor would be available to me. When I went up there on Sunday night, though, the reception was anythng but friendly. A man and a woman were lounging there watching TV, and I guess they must have been the Concierge staff because they questioned, \"What do you want?\" in a not very nice manner. At that point, I was mostly looking to see if I could find the computer \"hot spot\" the hotel supposedly had. I had no luck in the lounge so I tried the lobby. I had no luck there either. I believe the service just was not working correctly. All in all, everything was adequate, but I disagree with a prior posted review about great service. My experience was that the service was lacking, especially considering the prices.", "Date": "September 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay, will stay again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2576319", "Content": "my family and i attended a air show convention in indianapolis, the banquet was held at this hotel.

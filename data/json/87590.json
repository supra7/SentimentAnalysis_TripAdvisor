The location of the hotel puts visitors within easy walking distance of various museums, great restaurants, and shopping. I've stayed here many times. My consistent impression is that the Hilton Chicago is a big hotel. It's really big. But the service level of the staff make the Hilton Chicago seem like a boutique hotel. The staff is friendly and highly attentive. Ditto for the restaurant and bar staff. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Yes, it's an older hotel. It's an old fashioned decor throughout the property. However, to escape the weather of Chicago (summer or winter) and enjoy excellent views of Lake Michigan or downtown, this hotel offers travelers an excellent choice. Given the physical size of the hotel and the number of people staying here on a busy night, there can be a considerable wait for elevators. Unless you are running late for an engagement, a long wait for the elevators is a minor inconvenience considering the positive aspects of this property. One word of caution if you choose to use the \"L\" (public transport elevated train) to transfer from O'Hare to the hotel (use the \"Blue\" train line), the closest \"Blue\" stop is \"Jackson.\" Despite the appearance of proximity to the hotel, getting off at Jackson with more than one bag does not make for easy walking distance to the hotel.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful and historic hotel in a fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "RandPEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR126470851", "Content": "Our first visit to Chicago was made more special by staying front and center at this lovely hotel.

It was St. Patrick's day weekend and the hotel lobby was packed and the check in line was rather long. We were very fortunate for my boyfriend's Gold Hilton Honors membership because that got us in the Hilton Honors line! We walked right up to the counter and got checked in. Our room was on the 23rd floor and we had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan! The room itself was not very large. The bathroom was a nice size and both were very clean. The hotel lobby area is absolutely beautiful, but overall, we found the hotel to be a bit dated and it can use some renovations! The location is good....depending on what you want to do. We were able to walk to Adler Planetarium, but it was definitely a $10 cab ride to the Water Tower/John Hancock area for the 2 of us. We enjoyed the Hilton Honors Hospitality suite (for Gold members...I think!) in the morning. They served coffee, juices, cereal, bagels/toast, muffins, fruit, hard boiled eggs. In the afternoon, they served snacks and soda, etc. We never seemed to be around for the evening refreshments, but we were able to take a few cans of soda and I did get some popcorn one day too! A few issues that caused some disappointment... 1. When we received our bill, were over charged by $100 for the nightly rates. Thankfully, my boyfriend had his reservation printed off showing the rates he booked for each night. However, we should not have had to have this proof. When the woman at the desk rectified the bill, she never apologized. She just simply said, \"OK...it's taken care of.\" We expected at least an \"I'm sorry for your inconvenience.\" This was rather disappointing. 2. We had parking included as part of the package. However, when we went to leave, the ticket that was supposed to be validated for us wouldn't work. So, there we were in the garage...gate would not go up! So, my boyfriend pushed the \"help\" button and explained the problem. The man asked for his name and our room number to verify with the hotel. Without missing a beat, my boyfriend responded. After verifying that we already paid for the parking, they still sent a guy to check my boyfriend's id! We thought this was a bit much. Getting out of the parking garage took much too long. It honestly shouldn't be so difficult! 3. My boyfriend had asked for 2 Champagne glasses to be left in our room one day. When we got back to our room, it had been cleaned, but there were no glasses. He was trying to surprise me...and they blew it. It was a simple request they agreed to and it didn't happen. After the second request, the manager brought him the glasses. Again...no apology. Although our 3 issues weren't a real big deal, they were just a few things we don't expect to face with Hilton. Or rather, when things don't go exactly as planned or as they should, a simple apology would go a long way. We really aren't unreasonable people, but when we didn't get any acknowledgment from the staff on their mistakes, it became a bigger disappointment to us. This is why we would have to say that our stay was good...but not great.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat View but need renovation\u201d", "Author": "yayatran", "ReviewID": "UR126442423", "Content": "Me and my husband went to Chicago for St. Partrick's day weekend.

Not at this location. First off, I dropped my wife, kids, and luggage off at the front since I wanted to go park on my own and save $20 a night. (btw....if you park behind the hilton, it's $25 bucks a day versus $45 in the Hilton). I asked my wife to check in for us. She waited in line for 10 minutes, and then I received a call. She told me they would not check her in since it's under my name. I asked her to put them on the pnone, and she said they would not talk with me. 3 minutes later, I walked in and by then they had already moved on to the next customer. Of course, I was mad, but I figured I could handle waiting in line for a few minutes. Then, another line started to form as many people began to arrive at once. I realized we were all standing in the Hilton Honors line, and others were entering on the main line. So of course, the clerks started helping those people just arriving in the other line (not the Hilton honors line) before us! Why are there two lines and if so, shouldn't they be helping us in hilton honors line first regardless (i'm not sure most people noticed the difference in lines and no one was helping funnel traffic). So there were 3 desk clerks to help the 20 people in line. I thought they were short staffed for such a nice hotel. Of course, there were 7 bellmen waiting to grab our luggage! Maybe they should switch up their staffing and prioritze what guests really want? fast, speedy check ins after long drives in traffic. When I got to the clerk, I told her it was rediculous that my wife couldn't check us in? She never even asked for ID to see if the same address and last name? Also, I put a sign on some pizza boxes to throw away each day, and they never threw them away. the bar (not the irish place) has sllow service too!

I saw a lot of mentions of this in a quick skim of other reviews. Yes, the aesthetics are great. But the greed is out of control. $200+ per night is not unusual these days. But it would be nice if that came with something more than just a bed. Took nearly 10 minutes to get the TV to show TV programming. It had level after level of sales pitches that you had to get through. They wanted to sell you movies, hotel food, other services (because NONE are included!). Wi-Fi Access was $15 a day! Seriously?? Even if it's not included (which, for the price one is paying, it should be) at least don't gouge for it. $5 is not sufficient? I showed our Hilton Honors membership card and they said \"if you were a Diamond Member, maybe we could do something about the Wi-Fi\". Maybe? And only top tier? So, where's the Honor in Hilton Honors? What am I getting in return for my continued patronage of this chain? I have traveled around the world and stayed in all sorts of places. This is the first hotel I've experienced that did not (and would not) provide bottled water for morning coffee. Yes, they did provide a coffee maker. But we shouldn't have to make it with tap water. Every other hotel I've stayed at in the last 10+ years has provided water for drinking and making coffee. All hotels have late check-ins and early check-outs. No problem. It makes sense. So of course you just ask them to hold your bags before and / or after your stay while you do other things. EVERY hotel does it. Hilton Chicago did also. But they charged $2 per item. I can understand charging extra for everything when you're a small place charging $65 a night. A hotel that is part of one of the biggest chains in the world, charging full price (and we are \"members\", no less) shouldn't have to nickel and dime guests to death. I'm sure there are plenty of other places in the area that are nice and make you feel good about your stay. Doris Amidei, Manager at Hilton Chicago, responded to this review March 7, 2012 Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for taking the time to share your comments. It was a pleasure to receive your comments and to learn of your appreciation of the Hilton Chicago. We are always delighted when we hear we have a nice looking hotel. It appears as we fell short in meeting and exceeding your expectations especially, as it relates to the water, TV, internet & baggage charges and for this, we sincerely apologize for any disappointment this may have caused. As for the internet charges and other hotel fees, please be assured, the Hilton Chicago works hard to offer guests one of the most competitive pricings for the downtown area. We understand staying connected is important, and that as a business traveler internet service is critical to getting work done, we have dedicated our hardwire and wireless systems to run off a 100-Meg Metro E Circuit. Powered by AT&T when purchasing any internet services you will also receive onsite technical assistance along with 24-hour technical support via our help line. We truly hope you will allow us the opportunity to service you again, as we look forward to many more years of serving you in the true spirit of hospitality for which Hilton Hotels are known. Sincerely, Damien G. McArdle Hotel Manager Dear Doris / Damien (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even be sure who was writing that). The rest of it was equally confusing. I say how disappointed I am and they essentially indicate that I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that way and that they hope I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back. Why on earth would I?? There are 87 hotels in the area with better ratings. I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d try each of them before going back to Chicago Hilton. I have been a Hilton Honors member for years. Not much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd going on. It is a loyalty program and certainly *they* are showing no loyalty. I think their attitude (nickel and dime customers to death on top of a fairly high nightly rate) is already a poor one. But when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer any improved services for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153members\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more messed up. EVERYTHING in this place is extra. Health club, Internet, bag check, etc. The fact that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get tech support with $15 per day Wi-Fi fee is not a consolation. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need tech support. I just need a connection. I like it in my room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not paying $200 a night to go sit in the lobby. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to charge extra for every single thing, then cut the nightly rate in half! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just ask me to feel differently.

There weren't windows on the floor on which my room was located, and because the ceiling is not high, it seemed a bit claustrophobic. I had requested a room on a higher floor, and the hotel granted my wish, but once I went up to my room, I regretted my choice because of the closed-in feeling.

Yes, the decor is very outdated, but that didn't bother us much. The flat screen TV was good. Our two biggest complaints were noise and cleanliness. I found numerous black hairs in my sheets and duvet cover. I realize they can probably creep in during the laundry process, but this seemed like an excessive number. The bed was not comfortable, and the carpet didn't appear to be vacuumed well. A large wedding reception was going on while we were there, and we heard the loud music into the wee hours of the morning. Perhaps our room was facing a ballroom; I'm not sure. The architecture in the main lobby and ballrooms was definitely worth seeing. Location: We liked the location very much, and we walked everywhere (lakefront trail, Grant Park, Adler Planetarium, restaurants, Metra). The Harrison Metra station is very close. Be sure to get a daily/weekly pass at the CVS across the street; it will save you a lot of money. Lou Malnatis and Yolk (great breakfast) are just a short walk. Jimmy Green's was also a decent place for watching sports. Service: We arrived around 10:30 p.m. and asked for a room with two bathrooms. The front desk agent didn't seem too thrilled with the request but did change our room free of charge. The Wi-Fi is pretty expensive. I wasn't pleased when I noticed an extra $10 charge on my Visa card several days after being home.

Then (and I write this first half of Dec 2011) they had only ONE restaurant open, and that was Kitty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pub\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Either they have spent enormous amounts of money to hire Disney to engineer and recreate an authentic, dark, grungy, dirty, well worn Irish pub, or they have a dark, grungy, dirty, well worn pub that badly needs to be renovated. We ate there one evening, and certainly never went back\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Kiddo had dinosaur chicken fingers and mashed potatoes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get those right. There were four adults and one Kiddo for dinner, and NONE of us finished our dinner. Jeepers. So, until they have other food options, be aware of this. (Nice looking restaurant reno across from Front Desk, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only open for Breakfast, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at their mercy for lunch/dinner) In short, a dire lack of in-house dining. Nearby, I can verify that Eleven Deli (Wabash at 11th) was quite good, as was Tamarind (Asian, on Wabash, 200 feet from Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s porte cochere ). Both are a short walk from the Hilton. (Of course, short walk is a relative term in Chicago in the winter\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Concierge Lounge was reasonably nice. Evenings had two hot dishes and a full selection of soft drinks and coffees. Wine and Beer selections were available, although they never tell you precisely what wine they served. Also, $8.50 for a glass of unidentified Pinot Grigio was a bit steep when a very nice Kiwi Sauv Blanc was available in the lobby for $9. GM, please help me out here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 make me feel like you and Hilton want me back. Breakfast was Continental, with NO hots, no chafing dishes. Big bagel selection, variety of pastries and cereals\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Fully acceptable, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I did use the Parcel Shipping Center, and the gentleman there happily taped together two boxes for me, and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge me. Nice. Very nice. So, this was our second visit to this Hilton property. Looks much nicer now, but the lack of restaurants is a serious drawback at this time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If eating in will be important to you, check what is open/finished there. Would I return? Probably so. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the Hyatt Regency, the Hyatt McCormick, the Sheraton, the Marriott, the Allerton, and so on. It depends on what I am doing and where I need to be. Yes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go back, but if location was not an issue, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably choose further North in the city. It was a good stay, not great...

I got a room with two bathrooms which was great EXCEPT that when the neighbors on either side took their showers at 6 a.m. the bathroom in my room acted like an echo chamber and made it feel like I was actually in the shower with them. When the folks next door came home one night overly inebriated screaming in the halls and bouncing against the walls (not the hotel's fault) and THEN ran their shower at 4 a.m. for 30 minutes I was NOT a happy camper. The biggest issue was Internet access charges that are about as non-business friendly as it gets. Paying $7.50 for up to an hour for net use is highway robbery to begin with but that's PER DEVICE. Have a pc and an iPad? Ca-ching times two, Even if you just use the Internet for 5 minutes you are charged $7.50. Log on again? Another $7.50 You can opt to pay $14./95/day for unlimited access but again that's per device. If you are staying for 4 or 5 days pay the $39.95 flat rate for up to 5 days, but better yet, if you are like most who just read and respond to 1-2 e-mails at best accessing the net for 10-15 minutes a day, throw yourself at the mercy of the front desk clerk and they may give you a promo code that lets you access the Internet for free. Most of the charges in the gift shops, bars, restaurants etc, are dramatically overpriced but opulence has its price for sure. A couple of gems- Tamarind around the corner on Wabash had incredible food at incredibly low prices. The same can be said for Uncle Henry's Chicken (dont laugh- they have killer fried chicken). Eleven about 4 blocks south had great breakfasts too.The concierge desk was very helpful as were the bell clerks.

Even at the conference rate, this was by no means cheap for me, a retiree. I booked it with my Hilton Honors card and arranged with the hotel itself to pre-pay my total stay over a period of several months prior to my arrival with my credit card. This was a rather laborious procedure involving several telephone calls to talk with someone who actually knew how to initiate such a transaction, monthly faxes, etc. (I quickly learned to simply Xerox one form and send it 5 times - the number of nights I stayed). I took the train to Chicago. As is often Amtrak's wont with long-distance travel, the train arrived 6 hours late at Union Station. I took the cab to the Hilton and, upon checking in, was told all the king-sized bedded rooms had been assigned. It was at this point that I employed \"The Voice\" - a firm, resonant, and potentially terrifying instrument which had served me well as a 38-year veteran school vocal music teacher. I reminded the young man at the front desk that (1) I was an HHonors member and (2) I had pre-paid the entire rate through Hilton and not some discount travel site and (3) that I had booked the room over 9 months before specifically requesting a king bed. As a salve, he placed me on a Tower Floor with express elevator access. My room was near the elveator bank, had two windows from which I could see Lake Michigan, had two double beds and two full bathrooms thought the furnishings appeared a bit dated.

One serves a good buffet breakfast (and buffet lunches and dinners as well) but food ordered off the menu is fresher and hotter and offers a wider choice. Chuck quickly became my waiter-of-choice each morning. He was experienced, efficient, and had a droll sense of humor. At the opposite end of the lobby was one of those typical Hilton cloned Irish pubs which had Guiness, shepherd's pie and what-not.

The furniture was old and too large for the room. There was an oversized dresser/minibar/TV stand that was an absolute waste of space since I was informed they were no longer offering minibars in the rooms (what!?) so the big opening in the middle where the refrigerator was supposed to be was essentially non-functioning and served no purpose. It also meant there was no bottled water in the room so you had to drink tap water, get your own water from outside, or order it via room service which cost an arm and leg. The desk in the room was also essentially a waste since the big \"ergonomic\" desk chair was wedged in between the desk and bed making it quite uncomfortable to sit and move around. But, probably my biggest complaint was the gigantic computer monitor that occupied 80% of the desk space. I'm assuming Hilton thought they would get with the times and put a computer in every room providing guests with \"technology at their fingertips\". I think the idea is a good one but would make more sense if we were able to access the hotel's services via an iPad or other tablet device instead of some big, archaic LCD screen. Also, if the whole point of it is to offer convenience then why did it tell me to dial \"52\" on my PHONE to order room service? Sort of defeats the purpose, right? Not only was this huge, thoughtless piece of technology neither helpful nor convenient but the screen would randomly turn on in the middle of the night! Since it was 12 inches from my sleeping face I would wake up in the middle of the night cursing and wishing I could throw it out the window. Even when I thought I turned off the screen it went into some weird standby mode and still emitted a fair amount of light. I ended up having to cover it with a pillow and towel. The food in the hotel was atrocious. I was there for a conference that charged each attendee $2,000. The food we got was worth -$2,000. I won't go into details, only to say it was some of the worst I've ever had. Also, to the room service guy who brought us our breakfast -- don't stare sullenly at the receipt after I sign it and then sulk out of my room because I didn't give you anything extra on TOP of the 18% gratuity fee that is ALREADY on the bill and all the other miscellany charges Hilton added on to my $60 breakfast that was worth about $12.

But, I was sooo much off. Every step you take, there is a peace of history, and you can almost taste it. I was expecting to see Fred Astare and Ginger Rogers to start dancing when I heard piano in the grand ballroom. For a building built in 1926, this was quite a surprise. You can, of course see sings of usage where ever you look, but everything was functional. It takes a moment to figure out the elevators setup too :D.

The Irish Pub was packed with people and the menu was pub food - as one would expect - except we didn't want pub food. Also the bar in the lobby was frequently closed, even in the evening which surprised us, so the only place to get a drink was the Irish Pub. However, despite the lack of resturant options, there are plenty of great restaurants nearby, so it wasn't a big problem.

The good: It is a grand, historic hotel in a decent location (directly across from Grant Park). The staff is helpful, the rooms are relatively comfortable and the bar (Kitty O'Shea's) is an authentic Irish Pub -- brilliant! I love the blues and Buddy Guy's Legends blues club is on Wabash, across the street from the back of the hotel -- easy. There are some decent dining choices walkable from the hotel that include a good sushi restaurant and pizzeria (Lou Malnati's). Most other activities require a cab ride. The not-so-good: Other than Kitty O'Sheas (pub grub) the hotel's dining choices are very limited. The location is OK if you want to stroll through Grant Park or Millennium Park -- other than that you'll pretty much need a cab since the hotel is ~ 1 mile south of the river and most of the coolest places to visit in Chicago are north of the river. The downright ugly: Very expensive for what you get. Not sure if they hike up the rates during trade show periods (which is when I stay) but it costed $279 + taxes for a total ~ $329/night. What made the price harder to swallow was the fact that I had just stayed in The Whitehall Hotel up near the top of The Magnificent Mile (same age as Hilton but much smaller and boutique-y) in a bigger room, better restaurants, excellent staff and a MUCH better location for just over $110/night!!", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sioux Falls, South Dakota", "Title": "\u201cNice but too spendy!\u201d", "Author": "Josh W", "ReviewID": "UR119193764", "Content": "This was a nice hotel, but it was too spendy for what you received.

Anyway, we asked for a different room and were told that they could not change our room because our booking was not confirmed since it was through a third party (Priceline). Bad, bad excuse, as the room was entirely paid by credit card at the very moment that we booked it, a few days before. So we decided to check the room to see if the smell was bearable. It was not; in fact, it was really horrible. We called the reception to ask for a non-smoking room; the front desk manager told us he could not change our room but could have the room 'ionized' to purify the air. This operation required that we stay out of the room for 45 minutes, not convenient but we were really desperate. After waiting for an hour for the purifying machine to arrive, we went back to reception to ask that the operation was made asap and then, we talked to a different manager who simply offered us a non-smoking room instead of waiting for the room to be cleaned! Obviously we were very pleased with this outcome even though we wasted about an hour and a half on this issue. It would have been so much nicer for us and more effective for the hotel if they had given us the non-smoking room when we checked in.

It also had very competitive rates. When you first walk into the hotel, you may find the layout odd. But after a few minutes you realize it's because it's a very old hotel. Not old necessarily in a bad way, but in a good way. You feel like you're living in times past, like you might see Sinatra walking by. But it has its quirks too. I found the front desk/reception area to be oddly placed and difficult to find when you first walk in. And while the hotel did provide that \"classy\" sort of feel, it could have used more work to make things more elegant. As a 4-star hotel, I would say it's middle of the pack in terms of lobby, rooms, etc. It had some nice amenities, but all at a price. For instance, the fitness center was large and had plenty of equipment. But it cost $15 per day or $29 per stay, which is not terribly high, but it would be nice for that to be included. The bed was slightly firm but the pillows were plenty and very comfortable, as were the sheets and comforter. The bathroom was too small but nicely decorated. The room itself was rather large but ackwardly designed. The view was decent and I liked that the windows opened a little. The AC worked great and kept the room as cool as you'd like it. The onsite restaurant/pub called \"Kitty O'Shea's\" served good food in a Pub-style atmosphere. My only real complaint was the TVs were extremely small, so on game day there were throngs of people piled inside all looking at tiny television sets. For Pete's sake, someone put some large-screen TVs in there! The other restaurant that served a daily breakfast buffett was excellent for the price. The buffett was good and was $16 per person, but included coffee and juice. Overall, I would stay here again if I were doing another quick trip to Soldier Field.

More often than I'd like, unforeseen events occur that warrant my staying in town. Just as I hit the road to head back home at 7:00pm on a Saturday, I hit a pothole and got an instant flat tire. I couldn't find a place to assist me in a timely fashion, so I started my hotel search. By the time I arrived at the Hilton, close to 10:00pm, I had spent over 2 hours assessing the damages: AAA, finding a replacement tire/rim, contacting my career associates, etc. You get the picture: I had a bad day. Chun greeted me at the check-in desk. I have to say that she really turned my night around. I was tired and frustrated with the day, but her positive energy and welcoming attitude put a smile on my face. This is why Chun is great at customer service: She has found the perfect balance between friendliness and professionalism. She treated me with respect and poise, but still found a way to insert her sunny personality into our transaction. While she tapped away at the keyboard (making adjustments to accommodate my requests), she continued to engage in a genuine conversation. She seemed to actually care about what I was going through, and she NEVER stopped smiling. What a delight. I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago. My experience? Most of the nice, luxury places are: a) so snoody that you feel alienated, or b) so over-the-top that you feel uncomfortable. The Hilton Chicago has found the perfect medium in Chun. Professional, yet welcoming. Luxury with personality. There is often a huge mistake made in guest service: Ownership and/or Management focus so much on the precision of rules, verbage, and pre-written script that the individuality of the employee is lost. I don't want to deal with robots. I want to deal with human beings that relate! They listen, care, feel... and maybe even have a sense of humor (gasp!). I also give much deserved credit to Kelly Walsh for creating such a great team. After my interaction with Chun, I asked her for the name of her manager. I called a few days later to directly relay my experience to Kelly. She was just as pleasant as Chun, and extremely appreciative of the feedback. While I only dealt with Chun on my stay, I assume that the rest of the reception staff is equally as helpful. Now to quickly address the actual accommodations: As other reviews have said, the hotel is a bit older but really beautiful. It is huge, and I didn't take advantage of the many amenities offered. I definitely will in the future. My room was VERY clean and a good size; the bed was super comfortable with high-quality sheets and down blanket. The bathroom was quite large. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a big difference for me, being the only one in the room, but is a definite plus for multiple guests. I stayed in a King with lighted desk and armchair. In-room coffee maker and bar. Touch screen flat panel TV and computer: they offer multiple options on both systems. I am unsure of the pricing for bar/snacks/internet/movies. Probably pricey, but I challenge you to find a place in downtown Chicago that's not. My only complaint would be the two lamps by the bed: They each hold 2 light bulbs, but only had one, making the lampshades lopsided and revealing a bit of the bulbs. I'm sure that this was an oversight by maid services. Had I REALLY cared, I would have called reception, but I was ready to turn them off, anyway. (On the flip-side, the bases of the lamps have outlets which were very useful in charging my phone.) My only suggestion: I would love to see robes in the room! Thank you Chun and Kelly!

This is a giant hotel right on South Michigan Ave, with a historic, grand, still-trying-to-be-opulent lobby-entry. The hotel is located further south than many of you Magnificant-Mile shoppers may want, though walkable/bus-able/taxi-able, but also convenient to the Field museum, and all the others nearby, as well as the park for those with families/kids, history buffs, etc.. For us, the location was fine. We've already done the museums from prior trips, and we're not big shoppers of the Mag-Mile. It was however limiting in terms of nearby good restaurants, bars. Let's go to our review: Good stuff: The room was a generous size. A tad-bit dated, but not too bad. We got a corner room, though facing back side of hotel vs. facing the park on East side of hotel (b/c we declined the upgrade charge for our Priceline deal). Plenty of room with our double beds, to get comfortable, featuring club chair & ottomon, LCD TV, credenza with drawers, writing desk, usual over-chargeable snacks/drinks, good-sized bathroom with nice toiletries. So much room, that they could have put another double bed, and still have plenty of room. The room was very quiet, even though we could see the \"EL\" subway rumbling nearby. Beds were fine, and room cooling was very comfortable. Additionally, there is a separate flat-screen on the desk to offer information or local places to visit. We didn't find it useful so really didn't care for it, and it took a few attempts in order to turn off. We were worried that the room would be very dated, old, musty, etc., but were pleasantly surprised it was fine. The location was just ok...but so reachable via bus or extended walking from other parts of the city. It is a few minutes walk to the museum area further East, if so inclined. It is however, not very close to the Art Institute museum, or the \"Bean\" sculpture, so please note there will be some walking or other options needed. If you're into fitness, lots of good walking. We were also told of large pool and fitness center, but did not utilize (chargeable?). Bad stuff: Like we said, the location was just ok... away from Mag-Mile shopping, good restaurant options, and other parts of city. A bit remote, but not truly. If you don't mind walking/public transit, not as big a deal. Given its size, there is a large check-in reception area with the long requisite felt-ropes, to queue up in a snake-like route, to a fairly indifferent staff. Everything seemed to be chargeable. We asked for a room facing the park, chargeable. Fitness center, chargeable. You get the idea. We were there over a weekend, with a convention for good measure, and sure enough, there were lots of people. This made the elevator area crowded & noisy, and the waits for elevators was long. Once you get past the lobby/main floor of the hotel, much quieter. Summary: A good hotel for the price we got (well under $100/night). It was a good-sized room with comfortable beds and basic amenities. Yes, needs a little updating, but fine as-is as well .. depends on your tastes. As mentioned, the location may be an issue for some...depends on what you're doing/visiting. We wish it was closer (walkable) to some good restaurants, but this city has plenty of transportation options. Would we recommend it as first choice, no. There are so many other fine hotels that we've stayed at, closer to the hub-bub that is Chicago. Of course, the price goes up accordingly (?) We would recommend this hotel as a fall-back option if others (based on location) are too expensive, or fully booked.

I booked though price line and had already pre-paid everything so I told her a standard room would be fine. Then she told me the hotel was overbooked that night so there was no more standard room available. Wasn't I supposed to be upgraded for free? I didn't know if the hotel manager asked her to trick the customer to pay more or it was just her own idea. She worked on the computer for another 5 min, then told me she would give me a bigger room on the first night, but I had to move to a standard room on the 2nd night. I was a bit upset and told her I would like to stay in the same room for all 3 nights. She told me she would give me a free breakfast if I agreed to switch room. It was already 20 mins after I arrived and I was really tired, so I agreed. However she worked on the computer more but still could not locate the room. Finally she asked a more senior guy's help. This guy immediately found a bigger room and I could stay in the same room for all 3 nights. Then she told the guy she didn't need to give me free breakfast anymore because I got the same room for 3 nights. She just said that right in front of me!! The guy was very reasonable and told her that was at least she could do to let me wait for so long during checking in. At the end, I got free room upgrade and breakfast. However I am still not happy.

The staff was friendly and helpful, though, and upgraded us to a larger room, in the end, which was more or less neutral in odors. We ordered dinner through room service, and the food was okay.

Location and Getting There: We flew into Chicago O'Haire in the morning and took the blue line to Jackson Station, walked through the tunnel to the Red Line, then took it two stops to Harrison. It is a short walk (also seemed very safe) from the Harrison Station (on the Red Line) to the hotel. Total cost for 2 adults and 2 children was around $7. Transfers from airport were about $80. Huge savings. Trip took about 1 hour, and if you have a lot of luggage the stairs and train can be a hassle, but we did it with two small children and suitcases. The hotel sits right across the street from Grant Park, a beautiful location. The park itself has a lot to offer, so definitely check it out. There is always some event going on during the summer. The Hotel: The hotel is quite ornate, though a bit dated (which is part of the charm), on the inside. We had reserved two rooms, one for my family of four and one for my father and his wife. We arrived early, around 12pm, so the rooms were not ready. They took our cel phone number to call us when they were ready. We went to a nice NY-style diner nearby for lunch (Eleven City Diner), it is only a short walk from the hotel. During lunch, the hotel called to say the room was ready. Nice touch. However, when we got back, only one of the rooms was ready. We checked in anyways, headed to our room with a bellman, only to discover that the rooms were not adjoining. (which they had promised when we arrived) Well, the bellman was fantastic! He called down to his \"connection\" at the front desk, they did some juggling, and we ended up with adjoining rooms on the front of the hotel (these were supposed to cost extra, which we didn't pay for) with a great view of the park. Definitely recommend using a bellman to show you to your room, he said they can typically take care of things for you, and it only cost the price of a tip. Best money I spent all weekend! BTW, he was very courteous and didn't solicit for the tip. Overall, our stay at the hotel was very nice. Rooms are comfortable, a bit older, but very clean and everything was in working order. There was no \"musty\" odor, once the air-conditioning was on. Breakfast was very good (it was included with our rate), the cook at the omelet/pancake station even made us some special pancakes, guaranteed to be nut-free, for our daughter who is allergic. The rootftop pool and sundeck was nice, though we didn't end up using it, too much to do in Chicago. Overall, a very nice hotel in a good location (if you want to visit the park, aquarium, Field Museum, etc....).

When we walked in, we were absolutely delighted to find a very nicely-sized room on a high floor with executive access. The room was extremely well appointed, featuring polished cherrywood furniture in a classical style, suitable for the age and period of the building.

The experience was OK, but I expected better given the Hilton name. Rooms were OK although internet wasn't free; breakfast was slow and the food 'ok'. It's a large hotel and looking tired in places. The Irish bar offered ok meals and provided an alternative to the buffet restaurant. The location was too far downtown for shopping or much else; you had to taxi to/from or shed shoe leather to 'go' anywhere. But it's on the main list for a free shuttle to/from the convention centre. Taxi from O'Hare airport was $50 - no courtesy shuttle to/from the airport as some other hotels provide. I had time on my way home to take the airport express shuttle service to which the hotel subscribes - only cost $30 including gratuity and even though I allowed an extra hour I only just made my flight becayse this 'express' service stops at multiple hotel pickups before heading for the airport - so avoid - you're much better off paying $20 more for a regular taxi to get you to the airport on time.

Lots going on close by at that time like Taste of Chicago, concerts, fireworks, etc. This hotel dates back to the grand era of urban hotels with its cavernous ballrooms, ornate fixtures, and long list of VIPs who've stayed here over the years. With 2 adults and 2 kids (13,10) we had a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms. The 2-bathroom rooms are a HUGE plus when 4 people are trying to get ready in the morning! The room itself was a roughly 350 sq ft room and a bathroom was on each side of the main room. Beds were very comfortable, climate control was great for cooling, LCD tv had lots of channels, water pressure even at the 18th floor was very good. Getting extra towels each day was no problem. Concierge was good (but personally I thought could have given better deals - i.e. baseball tix with a 50% to 75% mark up???!!!). Check in/out was fast and staff were very knowledgeable. Called ahead a few days to reserve a refrigerator for the room - DO THIS if you can and go to a local food store (we used CVS a few blocks away) and stock your room with cereal, fruit, milk, juice, crackers, etc.- especially for when you're looking for a snack or quick breakfast. Fridge is $40 for length of your stay but we saved some serious $$ eating a quick breakfast in the room each morning as their buffet breakfast is over $20/person. Indoor pool is nice, sundeck is nice, lots of seating and even more towels available. Exercise equipment is not free unless you are a silver or higher HHonors member. Biggest gripe is the wireless internet charge of $40 for 5 days or $18 for 1 day. The Motel 5 at any truck stop provides free internet so being charged so much for wireless after paying nightly room rates of $250+ is pretty greedy in my opinion. But I must admit the wireless speed was fast and reliable.

There was lots to like, although there were some flaws. I'd say it's 3.5/5 (I defaulted to three, average, in the TripAdvisor system). Had the service at check-in been better and the concierge lounge more in-line with the quality of lounges at other Hilton properties, it would have easily been a \"very good.\" The hotel is huge and hosts big conventions. That has advantages and disadvantages -- it's advantageous in that the lobby is always busy, there's always people to watch, etc. It's disadvantageous in that the lines at check-in can be long, there are lines for elevators, etc. Overall, I think you have to know whether you like big downtown hotels or not. If you do, you'll like this property's size and vibe; if not, you should look elsewhere. Given its size, it's not the kind of hotel that's going to feel intimate and personalized, even if the service is of high quality. That said, the hotel's structure itself isn't corporate in that bland, every-property-the-same way that you often find with hotels -- the lobby and public spaces are beautiful and full of history; the hotel does a nice job of highlighting this history through wall-hangings, etc. My room was fine, although it was very small. (Given this hotel's historic nature, the rooms are all over the place -- I've stayed here previously and had a much larger room; this time, my room was small.) Everything was in good condition -- nice-looking bedding, very comfortable mattress, clean carpet, nice television, etc. The bathroom felt a little older, but still had nice surfaces. The decor is old-world, which is appropriate for an historic property like this one, but it felt relatively fresh and not worn-out. Since I was on an executive floor, I had upgraded personal care products (inclusion of body wash, mouthwash, etc.), a robe, etc. The desk had a large flatscreen monitor on it; this appeared to replace a typical guest service guide. You could look up information about Chicago, look at the room service menu, etc. Overall, I thought that the touch screen didn't add much beyond show -- the information on Chicago was limited (and, annoyingly, largely targeted those tourist-heavy businesses that had chosen to advertise on the system), the touch-screen functionality wasn't always responsive, and it took up a lot of space on the desk that I would have preferred for personal use. Service at the hotel was mixed. My check-in experience was not very positive. There was a VERY long line (even in the lane for Hilton HHonors elite members), no apology for the wait, and an agent who (1) was very transactional in her approach and (2) wasn't very knowledgeable about Hilton HHonors benefits. The doorman opened my cab door, but offered no assistance with the luggage in the cab's trunk, nor did he open the door for me. Thankfully, other service shined -- housekeepers said hello at every turn, there was nightly turndown service, room service was polite and very timely, etc. Food and beverage were similarly mixed. My room service ordered came very quickly and, for the most part, was very good. I had a salad that was full of vegetables and very, very good. The bruschetta I ordered had fresh ingredients, but the bread had gotten soggy, which made it hard to eat. While room service largely impressed, the breakfast and snacks in the concierge lounge were a huge disappointment. My advice is to NOT go for the upgrade of a concierge room at this property -- the breakfast (some stale-tasting bagels, cereal, and pale-colored melon) is on par with what you might find at a Fairfield Inn. That was a big disappointment -- you'd think Hilton would aim to impress with the concierge lounge at one of its flagship properties, but the impression given is that they've just aimed to cost-cut. The staff also didn't keep up with replacing the food in a timely manner. During both the evening cocktail hour and two mornings of breakfast, there were long lines while the guests waited for the staff to replace items that had run out. The hotel's fitness center is fantastic -- huge with tons of equipment, high ceilings, views of the city, etc. The only bummer is that it closes (I prefer 24-hour hotel gyms) and that, unless you are a Hilton HHonors elite member, it costs money to use (I didn't have to pay thanks to my Hilton status, but I still find it obnoxious when a hotel charges people to use its gym). The hotel's location is OK. It's right on Michigan, so it has great views of the lake (from at least some of the rooms) and is immediately across from Grant Park. However, it's in the South Loop area, so most of the major attractions and businesses are a few blocks from the hotel itself. Overall, I enjoyed the hotel, and it delivered a good value for what I paid. However, by no means did the hotel win my loyalty -- there are other hotels within the downtown Chicago area that easily match this hotel in terms of quality of accommodation, service, location, etc.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cDirty hotel and bad management\u201d", "Author": "djdjdj100", "ReviewID": "UR114888068", "Content": "I stayed at the Hilton hotel for 5 nights.

We managed! LOL! My biggest complaint is that the bathroom did NOT have a fan!! Ugh! The hotel should also update the carpet in the hallways and in the rooms (or at least on the 11th floor), or maybe even a really good cleaning, it would look a lot better. However, it was really neat that the room had a computer that said welcome and had information for me for free. That was cool!

I guess that doorman \"showed us!\" Welcome to Chicago. Our \"upgrade\" was a \"2 bathroom\" executive room. We weren't impressed. The reception desk was efficient, but not overly friendly or accommodating. The hotel, the day after Memorial Day, was almost empty on the executive floor, but we did not receive a \"view\" or \"corner view\" room. The room was incredibly noisy with street and \"elevated train\" noise - good luck getting a good night's sleep. The hotel lobby is beautiful and the hotel has a \"historic\" ambience, but the rooms, even on the executive floor aren't anything to write home about.

There is no safe in your room. Unbelievable for a Hilton. If you want to secure your belongings, you have to use the hotel lock boxes. If you lose the key, it will cost you a $175 \"drill fee\" to open the box.

The \"manager's reception\" is the same cheese and crackers and soft drinks night after night - and they throw in something \"hot\" like a meat-filled puff pastry which I did not find edible.

Big closet, spacious bathrooms are a big advantage. Disadvantage: no internet, it costs extra. No business center to use free internet. You have to pay.

The room is super small, but we were never in the room anyhow. It was nice having the 2nd bathroom since we had a teenage girl and boy with us. One bathroom has a stand up shower while the other has a bathtub. The beds were small, but worked, especially considering I shared my bed with my neice and it was fine and my husband shared his bed with our son, no complaints from anyone. The pool and jacuzzi were very busy, but we still managed to get a spot and enjoy the jacuzzi tub. BTW-there are 2 jaccuzis by the pool, so that was a plus. The pool is very large, and I'm sure one of the largest you'll find in Dowtown Chicago. The location was ok, we wanted to be as close to the museums as possible. The Shed and Field Museum are both within walking distance. We did get an all day bus pass on the second day, since the museum of Science and Industry is way to far to walk. The bus pass was only $5.75 each and we ended up going from the hotel to the museum, to Ed Debevics, Navy Pier, and Willis Tower, so it was well worth the cost. Much cheaper than a taxi cab would have been. There wasn't really any restaurants close by, except for Buddy Guy's Legends. Do yourself a favor and go there, I had the BEST jambalaya ever, no wonder its rated in the top ten of the taste of chicago. My neice had the Gumbo and it was also fantastic. Stay away from the chicken, husband and son had that, they both said it was dry. While we were there, we even got to enjoy some blues music. My first ever experience and it was awesome. Also you can bring kids as long as its before 8 pm, and btw- after 9 pm its a $20.00 cover to get in..We were there on a Friday night, so not sure if that cover is every night. There was a liquor store by the hotel which was an easy walk for beer, pop or wine and I must say they have a HUGE selection of wine, plus on that Friday they had a wine tasting event going on at the store, so I was able to try a sample of $80.00 bottle of wine that I will never buy. If you get the bus pass, ask the concierge at the hotel to write down what #'s or name of roads that you have to get on/off at. That way if your not familiar with the area your aren't questioning every bus driver to which stop you need to get on/off at. I am appalled that the Hilton charged me $7.68 for a bottle of water that I never touched. Its ridiculous that they would even leave the bottle of water in your room, with no note stating how much it cost.

This hotel is a museum piece. There are many beautiful, ornate pieces in the lobby. The Grand Ballroom is impressive as well. It was clean and well kept, at least on the inside. As with any old hotel, there are areas that need work. First, kudos to the staff. Along with the thousands of Cubs fans staying there, the Bears were staying in the hotel the night before their game. Thus, there were a lot of people in the building. But throughout my stay, I had nothing but positive experiences with the staff. They were efficient and friendly, created an early check-in to help alleviate the rush. They get 5 stars. The room I stayed in was nice. No microwave, no fridge (though you can use the window sill in the winter). Wireless access in the room, but at $25 per day, it was way to pricey. My biggest knock was on the plumbing. The shower had a very small \"hot\" range. The plumbing also clanged in the night. 3 stars overall. The location is good, so long as you head north or east. I did walk around a bit in all the directions, and while I never felt unsafe, there were a few areas that gave me pause. It's just outside the Loop, and there are train stops nearby to get you where you want to go. The expensive wireless was a big issue for me. $25 per day or $8 per hour - there is no way I am going to pay that. Instead, I suggest going to Caribou Coffee behind the hotel, buying yourself a drink and using their free wireless. Bagcheck was $2 per bag. They did offer an hour grace on late checkout, but after that was $25 per hour. For that, I can only give one star. (I suspect that a portion of the reason for the expense can be tied directly to the unions that work at the hotel. Some of the stories I heard from folks at the convention on the costs of doing business in the hotel were crazy.) Kitty O'Shea's, the bar in the hotel, was reasonable and the folks were friendly.

Would def. stay there again - great hotel, good location, and the Irish Pub inside is Awesome!!", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northborough, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMixed Feelings\u201d", "Author": "RedSoxRox", "ReviewID": "UR89337759", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a conference at the end of November. Walking into the hotel you see this grand setting with ornate decorations with a very upscale feel. Once you head to the rooms and other areas of the restaurant, that feeling immediately disappeared. I arrived on a Sunday and the hotel was filled with Bears fans from the game going on that day as the hotel was close to the stadium. At times this made me feel a bit out of place as a business traveler surrounded by a ton of football fans. Beginning Monday, the atmosphere transformed to a business setting. Check-In Check-in was smooth and I was able to check-in around 1pm. I was able to go up to my room immediately and freshen up. Room I arrived in my room on the 15th floor and walked into what was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in, even smaller than the European hotel rooms that are notoriously small. The TV was practically on top of the bed. When I turned on the TV and started flipping through the channels I came across a fitness channel with someone doing Yoga. I looked around and didn't know where anyone could possibly even do something like that in this room. Small doesn't even begin to describe it. I also found the lighting to be very poor. I needed to turn on about 6 different lights in order to be able to read and even then the lighting wasn't very great. Unfortunately, the bathroom wasn't much better. I began referring to the bathroom as the \"Brown Room\" because everything, from floor to ceiling was some shade of brown. It was very depressing. The bright side was that there was a TON of counter space and a full size hair dryer was provided. On the down side, I found the bathroom to be pretty dirty, as though it wasn't really cleaned after the previous guest. This feeling was confirmed when I went to take a shower that night and discovered that the shower gel that was provided in the shower was previously used. I was not very happy and didn't exactly feel very clean. I called down to housekeeping to ask for more shower gel to finish cleaning up and asked that the bathroom be cleaned the next day. I did receive more shower gel about 30 minutes later but the bathroom was never really cleaned. Mildew was on both of the soap holders in the shower for the entire trip. At one point I took a wet towel and wiped things down because I just didn't feel clean. There were two other things that bothered me about the bathroom. The toilet was one of those commercial toilets that everyone flushes by kicking with their foot. You know the kind I mean. I really prefer a standard toilet in my hotel bathrooms with your standard handle. It bothered me, but was something that I got over. The final thing that bothered me about the bathroom was that the shower curtain didn't go completely around the shower so a lot of cold air from the window at one end of the shower would flow into the shower as you were taking one. I had to crank up the temperature of the water to stay warm. Luckily, there was plenty of hot water to do that. I will say that for a hotel in the city, I did not hear the city noise except for the occasional siren. This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at in a city for cutting out city noise. Food The first night I stayed here I ate at the restaurant in the hotel lobby. I thought the selection of entrees was a bit weak and not exactly appealing. I started with the buffalo shrimp, which were FANTASTIC!!! After that, I don't think I had anything that I really cared for. I had the meatloaf entree since it was the least unappealing thing to me and it wasn't very good. Service, however, was great and very attentive. Later on that week I had room service while I was working in my room. The food arrived about 30 minutes after ordering. I had the BLT sandwich, which was probably the worst BLT I've ever had. After those two experiences I didn't eat at the hotel again for the rest of the trip. I don't drink caffeine, but for those that do, there's a Starbucks just past the check-in counter. Cleanliness As you could tell by my previous note about the bathroom, I was pretty disappointed with the cleanliness of the hotel. I think my experience with the bathroom pretty much sums things up well. Housekeeping didn't come one day to clean my room. I'm guessing this is because I didn't leave my room until about 9:30/10:00am to head to the conference after doing some work in the room. Still, for a hotel like this, I should have received housekeeping by the time I returned to my room that evening. It wasn't like I had the \"do not disturb\" sign on my door either. Service Service at the hotel was hit or miss. I had good service at check-in and at the restaurant, but other than that I felt like just another number and as though they didn't really care. Location The location of this hotel is great if you're going to a Bears game or don't mind walking. I walked around downtown the first day I arrived and had to walk far to get to where a lot of the action was. The nights that I went out for dinner I found it very difficult to find a half way decent restaurant in the area. Because there are several colleges around I found a lot of Subway restaurants (which I hate) and McDonalds, but no real restaurants except for those in other hotels. If I were to come back to Chicago for pleasure I would stay somewhere different and a little closer to the action. All in all, I thought this hotel was just very average. Nothing made it stand out in a positive way and there were multiple things that just weren't that great. I wouldn't return to this hotel and probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "2", "Value": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok\u201d", "Author": "momwithfivekids7", "ReviewID": "UR89119591", "Content": "We took our daughters to Chicago for the weekend.

The hotel is nice. You can tell it is old but somethings are really cool. Even though it is old they have tried to make it as modern as possible. The hotel is in an area that is far from most things but close to the aquarium and soldier field. There is so much public transportation that it's easy to get around. We are hilton honor members and we were \"upgraded\" to a suite. This was the smallest suite we have ever stayed in. When you hear \"we are going to upgrade you to a suite\" you imagine a big roomy and luxury room. Nope....not this one. After entering our room we wondered what the regular rooms looked like since our \"suite\" was so small and cramped. We were put on the 24th floor where breakfast and appetizers are part of your stay. So I guess the free food made up for the cramped room. The YOLK restaurant about 2 blocks away is the best. Once we found it we ate there for breakfast and lunch. Sooo yummy. The staff at the YOLK are great. Recommendations: The John Hancock building has a bar/lounge room. Instead of paying for a ticket to the observation room just go to the bar area and you get the same view but you get to enjoy the view with a drink in your hand. How yummy is that. The caramel martini is yummy. It's sweet but good. Hot Doug's.....This hot dog place is not around downtown but it's worth the drive to their location.

Yes, it's convenient to lots of attractions downtown. But I was nickled and dimed to death! We got a convention deal on our stay of $175/night. Regular rates are around $300. Parking is $40/night. Internet was something like $14/day. Two breakfast buffets and a breakfast ordered from the menu $75...and it was NOT room service. Yogurt, a small box of dry cereal, a water, a small container of fruit, and a soda was $25 at the convenience breakfast bar in the lobby. If you want to check in an hour or so early it's another $25. The one good thing is that you can take the South Shore train from northern Indiana for a few bucks and the station stops about six blocks down from the Hilton - it's an easy walk. I was never worried about the area being safe...I always felt comfortable walking and shopping...even in the evening. Lots of attractions nearby within walking distance but wear comfy shoes. We had a double room with a double bath. Pretty cool. The beds were double/full size beds...not queen and not a large full size either. But not bad for one person. It really seemed like an over-sized single bed. But super comfy!!! The two bathrooms are small-ish. But they were both full bathrooms...each had a tub/shower/sink/toilet. It was convenient when we were both getting ready in the mornings. I had seen other reviews about the rooms being out-of-date but I thought they were very nice. I saw a friend's room - she had a corner suite - living room area and separate bed/bath area. It was super nice. If you have Hilton upgrade points, do it, it's worth it. The hotel is older but very, very pretty and well-kept. The front desk clerk was over-the-top friendly as were all the hotel employees. There are other hotels in the immediate area if you are interested in something cheaper. Lolapalooza was playing directly across the street. I could hear the bands from my room..even with the window closed..but it wasn't annoying. The bands stopped playing early enough that it didn't disrupt my sleep. Saw lots of palooza fans staying in my hotel and also walking to others to the west of the Hilton. All in all a good experience. I know how Hilton has made its millions though....the freakin' fees!! My 401k will never be the same....HAHA. I marked that I would recommend this hotel to a friend because it was beautiful, was close to lots of attractions, etc., but I would also not recommend it because of all the added expenses. One thing I did like was that you could put a stop on any charges to the room when checking in. So no one can charge meals, drinks, etc. I also wanted to say that there is a formal dining area in the hotel and also a casual bar. Regardless, they are both pricy.

Priceline rated this hotel four stars. I have stayed at other four star hotels in Chicago (Palmer House Hilton & Westin North Michigan Avenue), sadly this is not a four star hotel. I was excited to stay at this hotel due to its history and Grant Park location. The lobby is regal and stately, if a little worn. The greatest disappointment was my room. I was given a room on the 13th floor (I should have known!) at the end of a hallway. The door to my room was difficult to open and there was a used pillowcase on the floor. In addition, the room had a distinct odor, like antiseptic and pesticide mixed together. The furniture was dated and the bed springs creaked - this was most surprising to me as most HIlton beds are great. A few other tidbits I noticed during my stay - toenail clippings on the floor (I guess they don't vacuum) and mildew in the shower. The fixtures and style of the rooms are circa 1979's idea of regal and stately. A friend of mine stayed on the 6th floor and visiting his room (which was smaller) confirmed my review. Some people would say that I shouldn't complain as I only paid $70/night through Priceline. I say that Priceline should re-examine its rating of this hotel. This hotel is not on par with other four star hotels it lists in Chicago or in other cities where I have bid and won rooms such as Los Angeles, Houston and New Orleans just to name a few. The Chicago Hilton might not care about its Priceline guests and place them in its least appealing rooms. This is a mistake as most of my travel is work related (over 50 room nights/year for work) and I choose to stay at Hilton or Hyatt hotels. I will never book this hotel when I travel to Chicago for work, nor will I recommend it for coworkers. I might use Priceline for personal travel, but pay the full rate when traveling for work. Earlier in the week, I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and found that to be a true example of a four star experience.

This is a legacy hotel property of historical significance. When it was built in the 1920s, it was the largest and most expensive ($30 million!) hotel in the world, with the finest, most modern amenities. Staying here allows one to travel back in time to an era of elegance and opulence. That said, it is a property that, while recently renovated, has an older feel to it, taking you back to a different generation of traveler. We were upgraded to a spacious room, lake view, with two beds and two full baths. (My friends on the executive level said their room was tiny, so be sure to request a larger room). There are plenty of pictures already posted of the large marble baths. One has a tub/shower combo, the other a shower. Double beds were clean and comfortable. Two closets, beds and baths make this the perfect room for two people traveling. You don't have to trip over each other and there is plenty of space. We paid conference rate of $175 (with taxes, $200). When we arrived at the room, we had no shampoo (lots of conditioner!) and our headboard had a grease stain on it (probably from someone sitting up in bed) but a call to housekeeping brought hangars, soap, shampoo and a pleasant supervisor who wiped down the headboard. On the whole, housekeeping in the room was fair. Sometimes we were left amenities, sometimes not, and the furniture was a bit dusty, but overall, it was just fine. AC works well when you are in the room but automatically shuts down when there's no movement. You can fiddle with the thermostat, but it appears to be preset to 73, which when it's 95 and humid, feels just perfect. Staff is pleasant and helpful. Conference facilities were very good. Location is great for folks wanting to head to the planetarium or Field Museum nearby. Room service and food service overall is convenient, although hotel priced. The Mercat restaurant in the Blackstone Hotel next door has the world's latest Iron Chef, and we ate there two nights it was so outstanding. There was a huge convention here, as well as the Chicago Air Show, and the hotel was packed. It never felt overwhelming, however, and the concierge and reception staff kept their cool and were always cheerful and professional. I am a Silver Hilton Honors member but they still allowed me a very late check out with no additional fees. I'd recommend staying here, but make sure you ask for a lake view (it's worth the $25 upgrade if you have to pay it - otherwise you're probably looking at a brick wall) and try to get the two bed, two bath rooms.

I thought this charge was unnecessary for a guests checking in. We had to store our bags the last day too so we had to pay the bag storage fee yet again.

Marble and baroque wall paper. Brunch is very nice and also packed and comes at a reasonable cost. The hotel is rather large and check in and check out times can be very much like going to a large airport. A few areas for improvement are as follows: I was travelling with a group and we had two separate reservations. Upon arrival we asked if we could have rooms at least on the same floor as each other. The front desk person informed us that we might be able to but at that moment the rooms she had available on the same floor were smoking rooms. We were not amenable to that so she suggested that we try to check in later when more rooms would be available. I asked when should we check in she suggested that we try every 1/2 hour or so. I told her that she should call us when our rooms were ready and she agreed that she could. At a hotel with this \"grandeur\" I felt that she should have suggested this not the other way around. Our second issue occurred when we attempted to use the gym only to be told rather rudely that it cost $20 per day to use the gym. It was said in a rather condescending \"You know this costs $20, right?\" by the attendant. First of all a fee to use a gym in a hotel that you are a guest of is absolutely outrageous. And at that cost I could pay for 1/4 - 1/2 a month use at most gyms. \"Higher end\" hotels seem to have this problem with adding on fees for everything from the use of the internet to the gym whereas lower cost hotels see these as part of the package. This is the difference between American Airlines and Jet Blue. The hotel industry needs to do better. Our last issue with this place and the most major one related to them charging our stay on our credit card prior to check out versus simply placing a hold. This became a major issue at check out as we had planned to split the bill. In the end it took the staff about 20 minutes to resolve this issue. I have never had a hotel do this before and did not appreciate having the stay charged on my account even though I was sharing the bill with friends.

The continental breakfast was adequate, although very busy! They had bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt, etc. The usual for this type of breakfast. The one perk I did like was the room was open all day for guests to get coffee, water, or pop if you were thirsty. This was very nice since the rooms only had an already-full mini bar for a fridge. As I said earlier, the room was also quite large - which I know was an Executive perk since I had read many reviews of how small some rooms were. Other amenities: We didn't use the parking as I think $43 / night is highway robbery! I did notice some surface lots in the area that were as low as $22 / night though, that seemed quite cheap. The pool and hot tub area were very nice although busy. There were plenty of towels and the outside deck was a nice touch. Overall, I would stay here again if doing a primarily sightseeing trip to Chicago. This hotel is much closer to the museum campus and the Art Institute than it is to the Mag Mile shopping area. We walked a lot and used the \"El\" system to good advantage - the closest subway stop is only 2 blocks or so from the hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cA Hilton with centipedes in your bed\u201d", "Author": "nathanf1975", "ReviewID": "UR72374955", "Content": "Only paid $89 on Hotwire for this historic but rundown hotel on Michigan Ave. Let's be honest, the only things keeping this hotel going are its history and the location.

The room exceeded my expectations. There were 2 double beds like I had requested, but the best part was that it had two complete marble bathrooms i.e. with a sink, bath tub, and shower, toiletries, and extra towels. The agent also sent housekeeping up to set up a fresh pot of coffee, I guess because I had mentioned that I had a long flight in and a busy day ahead of me. I had not expected that and I was pleasantly surprised. The decor definitely seemed a little outdated to me, but it did not bother me as much as it would have had it not been for the great service I experienced.

I typically do not write letters to express my stay or concerns. This particular letter I am writing since I did not feel that the value of our stay met with the high expectations that should have been associated with the Hilton Hotels. ..... During our stay, we did request a non-smoking room. It was clear that the room was not as such..... It was acceptable, but not overly comfortable. What I did find dismay was that the accommodations and the service was sub-par. ..... The television was clearly outdated as a 500 pound CRT, leaving very little counter space for any belonging to be left out for convenience. I was somewhat surprised that updates had not happened as advertised with a flat screen television. Not only that, the television was broken. We had to call for service after putting up with a non-functioning remote for the first two nights when the remote finally just stopped working. The remote could not control the volume or the channels, despite the electrician coming on two separate nights and repairing the television, only to leave and have the television stop functioning again. It was just too disruptive to continue requesting his services....... I would have expected that the maid service would offered better service unspoken. The usual complementary coffee and tea bar in the room was nice to have. But unfortunately, the maid never replaced any cups after we used up the 4 that were provided on the first day. We thought this may have been a slight oversight, but when it was not adjusted the third and fourth night, we just did not bother. Similarly, when we ran short of Kleenex tissue on the second day; we thought it would be replaced the next day. I had to guess again. I am sorry to bring this to your attention, but I am sad to say that we did not find value in our stay or worth in the price. We are previous members of the Hilton Gold club, although we realized that we had let if lapse over the last 3-4 years. We have stayed many times at Embassy Suites and Doubletree, finding great value for the money and more than adequate accommodations. I am sad to say not with our most recent stay. For your records, we stayed in Rm 1918 during the above mentioned dates. Maybe the Hilton will respond or others will find the same and the managment will respond appropriately.

Room size was adequate. We had enough space to leave the roll-a-way bed open the entire time. Can't stress enough how comfortable the beds were! Elegant drapes and bedspreads. We had 2 bathrooms - one had a window which opened about 4 inches - nice for ventilation. We could see Buckingham Fountain from our room. Nice flat screen TV. Very quiet stay - we never heard a sound from other rooms or from the hallway. Since we were on the executive floor (we paid extra for this) we had use of the executive lounge. This was very convenient ! Had continental breakfast every morning - Bagels, mini muffins, cereal, fresh fruit, small pastries, juice and coffee. They also offered afternoon hourdourves - two items each day - proscuitto wrapped around aparagus spears, mini pizzas, crab rangoon, mushroom tarts, as well as bottled water and cans of pop. You could also buy beer there. The view out the windows of the lounge was of Lake Michigan - very nice. There were also cookies at nighttime. The only complaint I had was that guests from other floors took advantage of the executive lounge. Like I said, I paid extra to stay on the executive floor and didn't appreciate having to wait in line behind a freeloader to toast my bagel, not be able to sit in the lounge because all the tables were taken, or not be able to use the 1 computer in the lounge because someone who did not pay for the convenience was there.

I got an excellent deal on the Hilton Chicago via Priceline. We are a couple in our late 20's that drove down from Wisconsin, parked at a blue line station, and rode in to the city via the Blue Line with a transfer to the Red Line. The Hilton Chicago is about 2 blocks away from the Harrison Red Line. Was a convenient way to save money on parking by taking the train, and the short walk to the hotel was not bad at all. Upon entering the hotel, we were in awe of the beauty of the first floor. Check-in took about 5 minutes due to their being a long line. We had a great room on the 12th floor with 2 full beds and 2 full bathrooms. As previous reviewers have stated, the beds and linens are very comfortable and clean. Our room was very clean as well. There was a large flat screen TV on the bureau. Plenty of room for 2 adults. Again, gotta love the 2 bathrooms. I would say the only complaint I have was that the rooms were a bit warm and stuffy. Air conditioner seemed to be set at 74 degree's which was a little too warm for our liking. We probably could have called the front desk and had this resolved, but really didn't spend enough time in the room to justify a call (other than sleeping!). On day 3 we ventured into the pool area. We wished we wouldn't have waited until our last day to check this out. After spending time in the pool and hot tub, we sat outside on the attached outdoor patio (this all being on the 8th floor). There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance, or via a short ride on the Red Line. Like I said, I had negative thoughts due to reviews i've read prior to checking into this hotel. It's too bad others have had poor experiences, because we had a great experience! I can't comment much on the restaurants in the hotel. We only stopped at the bar area near the concierge desk for a Starbuck's coffee and pastry. Coffee was reasonably priced, pastries were pricey, but that was expected. If you do wish to use the wireless internet, there is an additional charge for this. We chose not to use this as we both have iPhones. Due to the Priceline savings, we saved about 50% off the price of this hotel.

Other L stops and State Street businesses are also within a short walk. We parked at Grant Park South for $28 a day, which is as good a price as you will find in that area of downtown.

The bathroom was also spacious, with a good-sized marble counter, and the shower was more than adequate. We thought the room was clean overall and that the bed was quite comfortable.

When we get to the room, the smell of the room was pretty bad...so we asked the front desk to check again. He told us that there is one room available, but it was a living room of a suite. But the living room has been secluded now from the suite and the sofa can be turned into a bed. Hello!?!??! Did I pay for the room/bed or a living room with sofa?

We had reserved two rooms several months before and brought two children and an adult friend. After a full day of travel I attempted to check in. The desk clerk scanned his computer screen, then announced \"we don't have any rooms for you\". He went on to state \"several people with your meeting decided to stay an extra day.......\" Excuse me? Control your hotel for god's sake. His solution? \"I can put you in two smoking rooms tonight then move you tomorrow\". I looked over at my 3 and 5 year old spinning in circles and my wife managing the 3 suitcases and various carry-ons and caved. I said we would try the rooms. We dutifully made our way to the smoking floor. When the elevator doors opened, the wave of smoke immediately made our eyes water. We bravely went to the rooms. Two words: NO WAY ! To think that putting two little children in a gross disgusting smelly smoke infested room is idiotic. Oh, by the way, my wife and I are health care providers which is the reason we were attending our academy's meeting. After dropping off our luggage and quick change, we went to the hotel restaurant right across from the check in desk as we all were hungry. After ordering, I went back to the front desk and told the person who put us in the cancer rooms that it was not going to work out. His next option was to put us in a \"parlor room\". We went back to emphysema central, packed our stuff up and all crammed into a room with a roll-away and pull out couch. He promised two rooms that connected together the next night. Mind you, this is the Hilton Flagship. Pathetic! The next morning, I went to check on the room status. There was much fumbling around and of course, the rooms were not going to be connected as previously promised. However, they said they would call when the 2 separate rooms would be ready. We went on with our day. That afternoon, the children went down for a nap (we made a bed for one by cramming two chairs together). I went again to the inept front desk to get a luggage carrier so I could move our opened suitcases and \"stuff\" while the kids were sleeping. The same person who thought second hand smoke is good for you was there. I explained I wanted a luggage carrier to move my self, he said \"you can ask the bell captain, but he won't give it to you\". I looked at him and said \"You will get it for me\". After more fumbling, I did get the luggage cart. Bottom line: Inexcusably, did not have our previously reserved rooms. Down graded us to two smoking rooms: perfect for 2 young children, and two non smoking health care provides (ridiculous). Crammed us into a parlor room, were we had to make a bed out of two chairs.

The room however, was where everything fell apart. Looking old is alright, but when everything is broken in your hotel room, something is wrong. Upon walking into the room we realized no one had been in there in months, judging by the rank stale air. The clock hadn't even been changed for daylight's savings time! The lampshade had holes in it, the sink had a hole in it, the toilet didn't flush properly and left toilet paper everywhere, the A/C was nonexistent and the shower was terrible. When I touched the shower handle, it fell off. I put it back on, to realize the shower didn't even work! The handle wouldn't turn even when my boyfriend tried it. We called down to the desk, who told us someone would be up to look at it shortly. This was at 10:15pm. At 11:10 I went downstairs to complain because we were tired of waiting and wanted a room with a working shower. The front desk lady was rather distant but told me they would \"send security up shortly to 'escort' us to a new room\". So I went upstairs and found out that the maintenance guy had come up while I was gone. Apparently he had had to put his entire weight on the handle to make it turn a little bit and told my boyfriend that he was glad it wasn't a 'real' problem. After waiting a few minutes someone came with new keys, which were for a lake view room. When we tried to turn the A/C on in this room a strong smell of ozone and burning hair quickly enveloped us and we had to turn it off and open a window. Also the outlet in the bathroom of this room didn't work. At this point we were laughing and trying to figure out all the things that were broken in the room. In the process we found that the bed has a tilt to it, the drying line hangar was broken, and the plush down comforter which used to be white had acquired an old gray color. In short, the only nice thing about this hotel is the location and the giant entrance hall.

The beds were very comfy and we slept well. This hotel has a big lobby with lots going on. If you like the big hotel experience with restaurants, shops, etc., you'll be right at home here. The location is on Michigan Ave but not in walking distance to the magnificent mile section of Michigan Ave. You'd have to drive or take a cab for sure. As for things that are in walking distance, the museum campus is very close so you can go to the Field Natural History Museum or the Aquarium, which are both great.

Paying $42 to park overnight is a little expensive for the South Loop area, however the conveinance of being attached to the hotel makes it worth it. **Note: You will have to pay for parking EVERYWHERE. There is no such thing as free parking in downtown Chicago!** Or, if you are not too scared to take public transportation, please do so as many buses and the Harrison red line train step is very near the hotel.

(pretty nice for paying $90 a night per room on Expedia!) Parking was an additional $43 per night. At check in they took all of our considerable baggage and it arrived at our room very quickly. Lobby and first floor of hotel is beautiful! The rooms were clean and very large with plenty of space between the beds and bathroom (about 15 feet) which was great for the kids. The room had three large windows and a small closet for suitcases and coats. The beds were very comfortable and bathroom was typical but clean and nice. The pool area was very great and looked recently updated. Staff was always present and the area was kept clean and tidy. It was a large pool with plenty of towels and the water and air temp were very warm which was great for the kids. Two average sized hot-tubs were also nice for the adults. Right next to the pool area was the exercise club which is probably the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel. The track you can use for free but they do charge for use of the equipment.

You can also valet it for about $10 more per night. The self park is very easy and just a short walk. The hotel is about about a 15-20 minute walk to Shedd aquarium, Adler Planetarium, and the Field museum. It looks shorter on the map but even at a brisk pace it will take a good 15 minutes to work your way around the park and Lake Shore Drive. Navy Pier (and the Children's museum) is about a mile to the North and in the summer it might be a nice walk along the lake but it would take some time.

We booked rooms on the executive floor for a small amount extra which means we had complimentry pastries/ cereal / tea / coffee etc for breakfast and unlimited access to soft drinks all day/night - well worth the money when you think how much an american breakfast would cost every morning ( we booked through 1800hotels.ie for these rates) . There is an Irish Bar in the hotel that served nice food and was a good bit of craic in the evening with the Irish people working behind the bar. The hotel is about 6/8 blooks from the discount stores on State Street. - Filines / Marshalls and those kind of stores. If you want to stay right beside all those shops and not have to walk the Palmer House Hilton would be a better location as it's right beside all those shops. The more up market shops are further up the street, but if you do the City Tour you'll get to see where they are. All the big hotels have the outlet buses that stop outside but as we hire a car every year I'm not sure how long the buses take - it takes 40mins to drive to the outlets. If your travelling over shopping like so many Irish people do PLEASE be careful when collecting your bags from the baggage room and TRIPLE check everything! We had a lot of cases plus hand luggage and a very young Bell Boy that really did'nt know what he was doing and didnt get any help from the older guys that were busy chatting. The hotel ordered our mini bus to bring us to the airport. When the bus arrived the Bell Boy only brought out 1 trolley with our bags (eah..1 trolley for 6 Irish women shopping!!)and told us that was all our luggage. We insisted we had a lot more luggage and asked for our baggage tickets back to get our own luggage. As the Boy went off to get help with our tickets we went to the baggage room ourselves to get the rest of our bags. When the confused Boy came back with no help we had most of your luggage out of the baggage room. The Boy said he would double check the rest of the tickets to make sure none of our bags where left in the luggage room and follow us out to the bus as at this stage we were running late because of the the whole fiasco! Moments later we were told all our bags where on the bus and off we went after tipping him $40. On arrival to the airport we realised 1 bag was missing and immediately contacted the hotel.

The beds were comfortable and my daughter thought the gold bathroom fixtures were the fanciest things on Earth! Our room had an unexpected little wet bar where I assume the 2nd bath would be had we opted for one of those rooms. I was glad that the room looked exactly like the pictures I'd seen. No surprises and no sense of switch-a-roo. The layout of the hotel can turn into a bit of a maze and we had to actually pay attention to the wall signs to know where to turn.

If we were staying more than the 3 nights, and the cancellation policy wasn't so poor.we would have switched to another hotel. The entrance doors are heavy and to close together to have a wheelchair between them so you cannot even open the double door entrances one at a time.

Of course you could order the two eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast with juice at the hotel restaurant for $76.00 for 3 people???? Yes very spendy and not inspired in the least.

The live Irish duo Saturday night added to the ambiance, which we enjoyed. The hotel is relatively close to public transportation -- in particular, the Harrison exit for the Red Line. My husband and I didn't feel uncomfortable walking around the neighborhood at night, whether to get back from the train station or to just wander around and enjoy the city.

The carpet could stand replacing and the bathroom tile grout could use some professional work. The bathrooms have been well-covered by others on here.

We couldn't find a telephone book or any other kind of directory (i.e.: churches; hospitals, etc). The air conditioning system was apparently right outside our window and ran constantly. I will say the air conditioning our room worked very well. As other people mentioned, the internet was too expensive. I found the bed too soft. The restaurants were overpriced, but we did eat at Kitty O'Shea's one night. I had potato leak soup($6.00) and my partner had Shepherd's Pie ($13.00). We've eaten both all over the UK and didn't recognize either dish. The Shepherd's Pie was especially bad and seemed more like a canned beef soup (light on the beef) with mashed potatoes on top. There was no discernable seasoning in either dish. The service was slow, but friendly. We had trouble several times with our room key not working (I heard other people expressing the same thing). The front desk assured us that it was because we had it near credit cards, cellphones or something else with a magnetic strip. What we found was the keys worked sometimes and not others.

We stayed for a week. Check-in was not till 3:00, so we decided to kill time by wandering through O'Hare and then taking the blue line to the Loop (Jackson) then walking to the hotel. We got lost (our fault) but if your compass works (ours didn't) it shouldn't be too far of a walk, even with suitcases. The check-in process was quick and the staff was friendly to us (we are both 20 but we look closer to 16, so we were happy to be treated like adults). We ended up arriving a little early anyway (around 2:30) and they let us have our room. The room was small-ish but there was enough room for two people and suitcases. The one thing I did not like about the bathroom is the industrial-type flusher on the toilet; I prefer my hotel to have a homey feel so I did not like the public washroom-style toilet (the toilet worked fine though). The bathroom had enough counter space for both of us. The bathroom did not, however, have a fan, so the mirror was always foggy after a shower. The shower was big enough, and had a good waterflow. Also, there was enough space on the edge of the tub and in the soap holders, etc. for all of our shower stuff (and if there wasn't, the ledge of the counter is right outside the shower). The only time we could hear the room next to us was in the bathroom, so that was fine. However, on the Friday we were there, there was a lot of noise in the hallway, and some drunk person was knocking on our door and trying to get in. Also, the people in that room were smoking (I believed it was a non-smoking floor). We could smell it in the hallway but after a few days the smell crept into our room. The staff we dealt with for these issues was friendly and accommodating (the lady at the front desk walked us over to the security kiosk about the noise complaint). We had hoped that the mini-bar would have a fridge in it, but it was just a cabinet with munchies (we were not even offered the key but we could see in it). Also, the bottled water in the room was $7, and the vitamin water was $5. Needless to say, we drank tap water, but there are Walgreens and CVS everywhere so you could go buy 24x500mL bottles for probably $10. So whatever you do, do not drink that water provided in the room! The room service menu was ridiculously expensive, and they add a $4.50 in-room dining charge, so if you wanted a sandwich it would cost you more than $20! We did not order, but I do wonder what a $20 club sandwich tastes like. The location was awesome. We attended Lollapalooza festival in Grant Park, and the hotel was close enough that we could go back to use the bathroom (and sit in somewhere air-conditioned) and get back in less than 20 mins (and not have to use the porta-potties). We timed our walk to the Hancock Centre and it was about 40 mins, but it's very easy to catch a bus or a train to the Magnificent Mile. The concierge lady we talked to was useless. We asked a simple question (when do we have to leave the hotel to be at O'Hare for 7:45?) and she kept telling us to leave 2 hours before our flight (which was at 9:45). We kept trying to explain that we had an international flight and had to BE there 2 hours early. Eventually she said it could take \"20 mins to an hour\" so we decided to catch our cab around 6:30 just to be safe. We ended up at the airport with about 2.5 hours to spare (but O'Hare is big so we shopped and explored). The cab ride back cost us about $45 after tip and took about 1/2 hour-45 mins.

Our large, male Airedale is over 70 pounds - so, he isn't allowed in most \"dog friendly\" hotels. At the very last minute, we booked a one-bedroom suite on the 25th floor (executive floor). The entire experience at the Hilton was excellent. From the moment that we arrived, the staff was very accommodating - especially to our dog! They made sure that Oliver had a dog bed, bowls, treats and lots of attention and praise. They even offered to walk him in the park across the street! The suite was updated and since it was a corner (south east) suite, we had windows on two sides - very nice - lots of light. The bed was comfortable and well appointed with plenty of pillows. Room service was very good - we ordered dinner at 8pm and at 8:20pm it arrived, hot and well prepared. Breakfast on the executive floors was excellent - nice options (including \"take away\" coffee cups with lids) and very friendly and helpful service - especially the concierge. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised - we didn't expect much since it's the \"old Hilton\" - and, since we just needed a night someplace that welcomed our dog, our expectations were pretty moderate. Hilton greatly exceeded these expectations - we would highly recommend this hotel to families with kids or dogs - the hotel staff goes out of their way to make sure that you're welcomed. Finally, I have to say, the common areas are beautiful and very grand (especially the front, 2 story entrance). With the very reasonable rates that Hilton is charging this summer, you can't go wrong - especially if you're from out-of-town - the location, across from Grant Park, can't be beat! P.S. - Be sure to check and see if you can upgrade your room rate by $10/night to allow for indoor, attached parking (the usual rate (if you don't include it in your room rate) is somewhere around $45/night!).", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "iNDIANAPOLIS,", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel\u201d", "Author": "pammie724", "ReviewID": "UR32115573", "Content": "I have stayed in this hotel four times for a trip to the city.

We have a relative that works for Hilton, so we got a deal we couldn't refuse to stay here, but I knew I had to hold on tight to my wallet when I walked in based on the previous reviews. Here's some things I learned: Rip Offs: 1) Drinks - At $10 a drink for a house wine or well cocktail, the bar in the hotel is absolutely out of control. We didn't have any food at the hotel after this experience with drinks. TIP: There is a sports bar one block west of the hotel where you can get reasonable drinks. Its called SLC I think. 2) Parking - Parking at the hotel was around $50 a day when we were there, even more for valet. There is a lot of other parking around there, with a wide variety of prices. We found a parking lot one block west (across the street and under the \"L\" from the Sports Bar) that was $6 for an over night, and then $13 for the next day. TIP: Unless you need to get pretty far out of the city, the mass transit system is comprehensive, cheap and seemed safe. We rented a car, which was really just a hinderance. 3) Business Center - There is a business center, but its around $1 a minute just to use... another rip off... No tip here. 4) Anything in the room to drink - the vitamin waters or regular waters are like $5-7 a piece... asinine. The mini-bar drinks were similarly priced. Just leave this stuff alone. 5) The gym and pool - The pool was closed when we were there, but I heard was complementary (I would check that, as its hard for me to believe). There is also a gym, but it costs $18/day to use. More $$$. Other cons: - The rooms were somewhat small, but fine. The beds were very comfortable, but the bathroom was cramped and somewhat dated. Maybe it was just me, but all the \"gold\" was very gaudy instead of beautiful. So why would anyone stay here? It makes sense if the following is important to you: - Staying at a historic hotel. At one point this was the largest hotel in the world, every President has stayed here, etc. It is very historic. - Money is no object for you when you are vacation - You need to be in the Grant Park area (though I imagine there are similar hotels for cheaper in the area) All in all, it wasn't a bad stay, but I can't stand people trying to rip me off at every corner, so I wouldn't probably stay there again.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cConrad (and Paris) Hilton should be ashamed.\u201d", "Author": "shlevine", "ReviewID": "UR27985629", "Content": "It's not a bad hotel.

And what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 6:30, not sitting down to their meager breakfast. The in-room wifi is a pain to access, and I somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though I selected the basic plan.

It's an unseemly waste of space, especially when the rooms are so meager. And the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992, not 2009, as does the picture-tube TV (vs. flat panel).

The hotel is beautiful, and for the 20,000+ crazed Cubs fans running around this weekend, they manage to keep it pretty spotless. Other than the view we've had some years (view of another wing of the hotel, or of a train track), we've had no compaints about the rooms. We have stayed here every year for fifteen years, and while service has been exemplary, as others said, it's \"Tip, please\" every time you turn around. January, 2008 we also stayed at the hotel. The chlorine concentration in the pool was so high that my three children had full-body rashes, and refused to get in the pool on the second day. (And for a 12-yr old and two 9-yr olds to REFUSE to go in the water is highly unusual!) I talked with other parents whose children has the same problem. We have been to several water parks whose pools are also well-chlorinated, and never had a reaction like this. I let management know during our stay, and then followed up with a phone call and internet complaint once we returned home. They explained that there *might* have been a problem with the chlorinator, but they offered NO compensation, or even an apology letter. Rather disappointing for someone who holds one of their Silver Hilton Honors Member cards. This year, just my husband and I stayed, not bringing the kids. Our room this year was $312 with tax and charges. The first year I stayed here, it was about $175 -- prices have gone up considerably. But the $8 bottle of water, and the $16.95/day charge for internet access are over the top (we chose to decline both). The Pavilion restaurant offers a buffet only during the convention, at $16-20/person. With a family of five, I don't relish spending almost a $100 on each meal. Buckinghams, the steak restaurant, apparently closed down recently, as it still shows on all of their in-hotel literature. Kitty O'Shea's, a pseudo-Irish pub, is a nice place to eat, with good prices. You can get a good burger there for about $9 if I remember correctly. During the convention, the hotel also offers some breakfast items at the bar -- you could get a bagel for $5, or orange juice for $8. Get the picture? I could purchase TWO GALLONS of orange juice for what they charge for a 12-oz bottle. That's not markup - that's flat-out robbery. Overall, the Hilton, while beautiful, needs a reality check for 2009. You're overpriced to start with, and then you overcharge for everything else.

No disappointments there. Chicago is great, friendly, fun and easy to navigate. The Hilton is in a pretty good location if you want to see the lake or catch a taxi anywhere, but it really isn't close enough for walking in winter with kids to any main attractions or shopping. No problem. The hotel is very nice and the rooms are equivalent to most Hiltons - nothing too fancy or big, but nice, quiet and clean. The restaurant downstairs gave you a fabulous view of the Check-In area (sarcasm) and it was very expensive for marginal food, but you kind of expect that from hotel food. The real downside to the hotel is that you are constantly required to cough up some money for everything. Do your kids or you want to watch some legitimate cable shows since the TV channels are boring by design? How about $10 for several repeats from cable? Would you like to print out your airline boarding passes at the hotel? They can't do that at the desk, but feel free to use the computers in the lobby that are there just for that purpose. I should mention it will cost you $3 to print that boarding pass. What's that? The computer receipt said $15! They can't help you, they say they don't own the computers. Want to check some bags for part of the day because your room isn't ready at 3 in the afternoon? Sure thing - that will be $2 per bag, plus the very overt reach for a tip when you pick them up. Are you exiting one of the incredibly high priced lobby stores with your $5 mints and are ready to leave the hotel? No need to walk to the front door for a cab. Some kindly doorman will intercept you and let you know that he has a cab at the side entrance. Tip please! When you get in that cab, you'll realize he must have had a special deal with a driver that couldn't come to the front entrance in his dented, urine soaked cab. Ours was so bad looking the cops pulled it over a block away, determined some paperwork was out of order and took it out of commission - letting us get out to hail another cab. And so it goes - \"Let me open that door for you.\" Tip please. \"Let me push the elevator button for you.\" Tip please. Knock, knock. \"Here's an extra towel from maid service.\" Tip please. You ordered room service. Tip please (as expected). But wait. \"I forgot something and will return.\" Several minutes later a different, very put-out person will arrive with the article. Tip please. The hotel is expensive to stay at, but I'd rather they charged another $50 per night per room and then let you enjoy the hotel experience.

Only a few minor things prevented me from giving it 5 stars. Pros: Check in was quick and easy, despite the kind of crowded main level (a lot of big events going on in the ballrooms mean people everywhere). I had reserved a double room (which is kind of tricky to find at a reasonable price in Chicago), and they had upgraded me to a double room with two bathrooms at check-in. The room was nice and decent sized and had modern conveniences despite the historic-ness of the hotel. The bathtubs were nice and very clean and bathrooms had granite counters and floors. There was a full-size hair dryer instead of one of the typical tiny hotel ones (which I didn't discover until the second morning that it was hidden in the closet). The mattresses were very comfortable and had down comforters with the nice white duvets. The room was nice and fairly quite despite facing the west side which faces the El track. The location of this hotel is great. It's within walking distance of the Museum Campus. Also it is easy to catch a quick bus along Michigan Avenue to get to the Magnificent Mile or State Street. The coat/luggage check charges $2/item once you've checked out, so that was convenient. Cons: The TV in our room was pretty poor quality. The picture was a bit fuzzy, and the TV itself seemed like it was about 10 years old. The granite bathroom floors can mean for cold toes in the morning. Our second night when we came back to the room, there was a $7 bottle of Evian on the table that was not there the night before. When I got my bill, they had charged us for that nonexistent bottle on the first night. They were able to take the charge off, but unfortunately it meant I couldn't use the zip checkout. Also, be aware, the person staying with me made a 1 minute 1-800 number phone call, and I was charged $1.50. Not a big deal, just something to be aware of.

I enjoyed the view of the lake, boats, Navy Pier, museums, and Grant Park very much. Nice fireworks show over Navy Pier on Saturday night which was pretty cool. The room was pretty big, but we did have an upgrade, so I can't speak for all of the rooms. You could tell the hotel was old, but they had tried to keep it upgraded with newer furniture and tile in bath. I didn't realize this hotel was so historic. Several movies were filmed there like My Best Friend's Wedding, which they promoted on various literature in the room, and the tv show ER films its helicopter scenes on the roof apparently. The lobby was pretty small for such a large hotel and kind of crowded with no where to sit oddly enough. Looked like they had two large ballrooms that I can imagine are used heavily for weddings and what not. With the upgrade, we were given access to the Hilton Honors floor which had a nice continental breakfast and cokes you could grab in the morning. Considering HHonors is free, definitely worth joining before you go to this hotel to get your free breakfast. Didn't try any of the hotel restaurants, although Kitty O'Shea's was tempting. ha ha Not. I saw the fitness area in the hotel which was REALLY big for a hotel with a walking track and nice indoor pool. A great amenity if you're into that kind of thing or have kids to splash around. Probably the best asset of this hotel was its proximity to the museum core of Chicago. You can literally walk to the Art Institute a few blocks up the street and spend a day there alone. You can also walk toward the lake and access the Field Museum of Natural History and Shedd Aquarium. I can't imagine a better hotel for walking to all of these world-class attractions. There are closer hotels to the Michigan Avenue shopping areas and Navy Pier (Embassy Suites for one), but this hotel is best if you are going to be doing museum hopping, and all three of those museums are worth visiting. I heard you could rent bikes and ride 20 miles up and down the lakefront, which I imagine would be cool in the summer time. Don't miss the Frank Gehry-designed amphitheatre just past the Art Institute a few blocks from the hotel. Amazing structure and facility. Also don't miss Giordano's Pizza. Yum. We mainly took taxis to-from Michigan Avenue shopping areas to eat, which cost about $9-13 each way. We dropped a LOAD on taxis over a 2-night weekend, but figured it would be about equivalent to a rental car and $40 hotel parking, plus parking in downtown Chicago is about $9 an hour, so that would also add up quick.

As others have noted the rooms also lack sufficient electrical outlets, which meant the coffee maker had to be plugged in either at the base of the bedstand lamp or in the bathroom (we couldn't reach the outlet behind the TV/minibar console). The real maintenance issue, though, was the bathroom, with badly peeling paint and some crumbling plaster on the ceiling above the tub, as well as strips of epoxy missing from the tub itself. The drain was also badly clogged -- or simply not up to the task of draining from a high-powered showerhead -- which we didn't discover until in the morning too close to check-out time to call the maintenance staff. (We showered in mid-calf high water; ugh.) When we mentioned this at check-out (the peeling paint , the crumbling plaster, and the nonworking drain), the clerk said simply, \"Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that,\" and proceeded with the check-out transaction. We weren't looking for a discount or a comp, but it's really been on my mind since then that we received such a lackluster response -- perhaps because the staff already knows that the ceilings and the drains need work but can't do anything about it. A gentleman behind on the way said out that this has been a problem in the rooms before when he's stayed there. The bathroom issue really makes it difficult to recommend another stay, although we otherwise loved this grand old hotel.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "streator, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room., Super Service, Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "cshager", "ReviewID": "UR20313484", "Content": "We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago.

I was at the back (with a view of the carpark) and I was pretty impressed with the room, although I guess having a view would make it much better. 2 beds, 2 bathrooms, 2 cupboards, desk and nice tv was great. I was on my own but the amount of space was very useful indeed. Very comfortable beds indeed! The lack of any sort of radiator or heating beyond a not always working air vent was worrying, I don't know if it's different in the middle of a Chicago winter. Paying for the internet was easy but why charge for that these days? I found the actual corridors and everything beyond the immediate entrance very drab and grey, looking much more like a bog standard hotel, not the sort of thing of place you expect when you walk in. I can't judge the food, drink or conference facilities as I didn't use them but the lack of ice/drink machines was a bit of a pity, especially being up on the 13th floor. To be fair they might have been there but I never saw them and there wasn't anything saying they existed. The $7 bottle of water in the room didn't get touched though.

I just returned from a convention at the hotel. The ballrooms and meeting rooms are lovely. The hotel services were very poor indeed, with very rude hotel workers who had little to no interest in doing anything outside of the minimum possible standards of service. This is NOT a desirable attitude in a $300+ night hotel. The restaurants are adequate - but very over-priced for the ambiance and quality. The breakfast buffet was very nice - but at $22 per person I do expect something better than an open to the lobby restaurant. The $7 half litre bottle of Evian was just the beginning of the nickel and dime behavior of this 'flagship' hotel of the Hilton chain. $3 for a 20oz soft drink is the standard. The cost of the wi-fi in the hotel was atrocious. We were relieved to discover a coffee shop a quick walk away from the hotel with FREE wi-fi. The rooms were nice - but $300 per night should be better than a 'nice' hotel room. The 2 bath room was wonderful - but the fact that neither of them had any ventilation was highly disappointing. For all of the Hilton's much touted \"be hospitable\" marketing - in this hotel; it is non-existent. Not one employee could have been described as going one inch to be helpful when very simple matters (key cards not working, etc) occurred. Just from when the airport shuttle dropping off passengers at other hotels and the complete lack of welcome we saw at the Hilton, there are several more hotels in the Chicago area that seem much more willing and eager to make sure that you will have a better experience than the Chicago Hilton.

I was not impressed with this Hilton at all and the staff acted as though all of their customers were a burden. My trip was not off to a great start when I called from the airport to let them know that I would need late check in (as in 8pm) and was informed by the snooty Hilton rep that she would put in that request. Fortunately, when I arrived they had a room available. I found out the next day that several of my colleagues' reservations were cancelled and they were told to find lodging elsewhere. When I got to my room, the \"dead bolt\" on my door did not work. I called the lobby and told them about it. The woman asked me in a very frustrated tone what a dead bolt was and once I referred to it as a privacy lock, she said she would send up an engineer and hung up on me without saying anything further. This was eventually resolved. Although I requested a King bed, I was given a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms. I found out that this was common in the hotel. The bathrooms were very clean. However, the rug in my room was very worn out and at times my feet stuck to the carpet. The beds were soft and felt worn out. They squeaked every time you moved. The pillows were comfortable and the linens seemed clean. The A/C was very old fashioned and did not work. My room was probably 80 degrees at its coolest. There were several amenities in the room but most were available at an additional cost- $7 bottle of Evian, $3.50 for 1 hour of wireless internt, a mini bar where you could buy $3 candy or $7 beer. You are even charged for 800 numbers. When I woke up the next morning to iron my clothes, I discovered that the ironing board had blood all over it and the iron did not work. I managed to iron my clothes without any blood transfer but I called to ask for a replacement ironing board and iron (keep in mind I just asked for it to be delivered at some point that day). Again, I was greeted by an annoyed Hilton rep who sighed and said he would see what he could do. Fortunately, it was replaced. (A colleague of mine told me that she discovered a large roach in her bathrub when she first checked in). Even though I was able to secure a group rate, I felt that this hotel was not worth the money. Although it is historical and decorated purposely in an old fashioned style, the hotel still comes across as worn out. The rugs need replacement and they need to make it a little brigther.

Everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful-the bell captain even took care of our recycling! We liked the airline check-in kiosk in the lobby too-this was the first time I've seen this. The bathroom in our room was fine but not generous. The big problem was with the floor of the bathtub, which was extremely slippery. It had those built-in strips that are supposed to provide traction but they were almost worn away, and no mat was provided. Adding to this, the drain was slow, so it was a dangerous situation. We had two meals in the hotel, one of which was the breakfast buffet. As usual in a hotel of this nature, it was expensive but in this case, the price was very much worth it. There was a huge variety of food, everything from cereal to lox. We also had lunch at Kitty O'Shea's, which was fine but nothing special. Prices were a bit high but not painful. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby during breakfast hours, with a comfortable sitting area adjacent. The hotel's location is a mixed blessing. It's across from Grant Park, with some shopping and lots of restaurants nearby. You can get to fast-food or a reasonably priced sit down meal within a block in any direction. There's not much in the way of shopping,though-the big stores are about a half hour walk or a ten minute cab ride. It's on the loud side though-Michigan Avenue is the front of the hotel and Wabash is in the back, with the El running all night. I like the train sounds but some might not. The elevators were slow most of the time. There are 3 banks of them which all operate from separate controls, so people press buttons on all 3 banks, which means that extra elevators are always on call. There must be a more efficient way of dealing with this by now, right? The most annoying thing about our stay was the outrageous price of internet access.

Now for the review: For a Hotel with such a grand history things have really gone down to the level of horribly average. Arrival: Upon arrival from the airport in a taxi our cab driver was of more assistance with our luggage than the bell staff was. The bell staff was very young, inexperienced and seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than opening the cab door; welcoming us; assisting us with our luggage (tagging it to be delivered to our room after check-in, etc). It seems that the work of a bell-person was a chore they were not paid to do. Check-In: Efficient with no problems what so ever. Given the room type that was reserved. Total time at check-in: less than 5 minutes. Room: Lugged our own luggage to the room. Bell-staff ignored us as we walked past them with our bags. The room was clean, seemed a bit dated but well maintained, until we needed the air-conditioning which did not blow cold air. Called over 5 times requesting maintenance. No one came so we left for dinner. Arrived back at the room at 1:00AM and the air is still broken. Also needed 2 toiletry kits as the airline had lost our one bag that contained liquids. Took almost an hour and over 5 phone calls to a very annoyed person at the front desk to get these kits and take the report of the broken air conditioner again. When the person arrived with the toiletry kits turns out Housekeeping only sent 2 travel sized sticks of deodorant. (Hard to brush your teeth with that). Made a sixth call to tell them that we needed the rest of the kit. The annoyed front desk person said she would correct housekeeping and have them sent back. Also informed that she had no idea when or if the air would be fixed. Asked to be switched to a different room and we were told the hotel was completely sold out. Asked to speak to the manager. He was able to move us to another room on the \"Executive\" floor. In addition he delivered the toiletry kit himself. By this point it is almost 3AM. He comped the 1st night. An acceptable end to a terrible beginning. The rooms were probably last updated in the 80's based upon the style of furniture, the bathroom tile, brass fixtures and \"gold\" trim on the furniture. Everything is in working order in the room. Carpet is probably newish. Beds are comfortable but sheets have numerous holes in them. The Executive Level rooms are NO DIFFERENT than the other floors. Also, the television is located on a large stand right in front of a window. It makes it VERY difficult to open or close the curtains. This was the case in both rooms we were in and can be seen in the submitted photo. It can also be noted that if you need to use the vanity mirror in the bathroom it is located VERY HIGH up on the wall and can not be moved. If your tall your ok, otherwise it is useless. See photo. The hotel is Grand in it's public areas some might like it others might call it gaudy; and very very average everywhere else. The service has A LOT to be desired. Based upon the service this should be a 2 Star Hotel, not a 4 Star as advertised. We've stayed in Courtyard by Marriott's with superior service and ammenities. Restaurants: We had lunch at the on-site Irish Pub \"Kitty O'Sheas\". The service was ok. The server's friendliness made up for her lack of speed. Overall the food was below average and pricy but the french fries that come with the hamburger were good as was the Onion Soup. All in all I wouldn't eat here on the property again with the exception of maybe room service.

Note: The free trolley has a stop right outside the Roosevelt station and could have dropped me very close to my hotel, if I had known about it. They have a system of free trolleys that run several different routes during the day until 6pm through the summer. This is a GREAT way to see the city for absolutely nothing.

Now..this place was gorgeous and truly a 4 star hotel, but the room was on the small side, even though it was a corner and overlooked Grant Park.

There are few places to sit and relax in the public portion of the hotel because there are event areas and bars/restaurants taking up most of the downstairs space.

There was a room service platter sitting outside our room when we got there, and it was still sitting there when we left the next day.

The website states it has one room with 2 doubles, and one room with a king, also includes a parlor. When I checked in, the clerk told me we had 1904 and 1905. When you get to the room, 1904/5 are listed on a plaque together, and have a seperate enterance at the end of the hall. You go in the double doors to a little foyer, the room enterance to 1904 is off to the right, and 1905 is straight ahead. 1904 was the 2 double bedded room, with 2 bathrooms. 1905 was a huge room with a wet bar, lovely views, a king size murphy bed, a sofa with a fold out bed, a loveseat, and assorted chairs. This room had one bathroom. We believed that this was the two doubles/one king/parlor, and this was sufficient for us, but we had another relative that decided to come in at the last minute, and I couldn't get another room unless i paid almost double for a single room than what I paid for the suite. So we reserved a room at the Swissotel, and she cabbed back and forth over the weekend. Upon checkout we examined the bill and there was a charge for food and beverage. Called down to see what it was, and was told it was for a bottle of water from room 1903. I said we don't have 1903, we have 1904/5. The person said you have the two bedroom suite, that encompasses 1903/1904/1905. The check in clerk never told us that, and we wouldn't have known, because the entrance to 1903 is outside the double door entrance to the suite. I had someone check, and sure enough, our card opened the door to 1903. We had shelled out over $250 and countless cab fares for another hotel room, and had an empty room with a king size bed sitting there all the time. I felt sick. They did check with housekeeping and verified that the room had not been touched. They took off the beverage charge and gave me a slight credit. I think they were unwilling to do more because I had such a good price on the room. The guy asked when I had made the reservation because he had never seen a price that low. Other than our unpleasant surprise at the end of our stay, we were very happy with the accomodations. There were a few gnats in one of the bathrooms, but not a big deal. My mom could sit at the window, and watch the boats on the lake. We are all women, so it was nice to have 3 bathrooms. The staff was all very nice, especially the waitress at breakfast at the Pavilion, and the Valet guy.

Despite my low pre-paid rate, my request for a spacious, quiet room on a higher floor was readily accommodated. (I was offered a lakeview room at an extra cost of $25/night, but I declined.) I was given a bright, spacious room with a king-size bed on the 17th floor, with a west-facing city view (Loop skyscrapers). I found the brown-and-gold decor rather boring and dated, but the room must have been newly renovated, because everything seemed brand-new and spic and span - not a stain in sight. The bathroom was also spotless. Bed and bath linens were pristine, bright white, soft and high quality. The room was quiet (except for howling winds one night) and I slept really well. Only shortcoming of the room: the thermostat wasn't working well, so the room got a bit chilly at night. It wasn't a big enough deal for me to bring up with hotel staff. Also, the room lacked a safe, which was a minor inconvenience. As expected for a hotel of this size, the lobby was often bustling with tour groups and convention-goers, so it wasn't a very relaxing place to hang out. However, despite the crowds, I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the elevator.

Now, the negatives- 1) I felt like the hotel nickled and dimed the customers for everything. Internet? $3.75/hour, and $12.00 per day. Want to use a treadmill in the gym? $15.00.

So when she said that she liked her room at the Hilton, it didn't mean much, other than she didn't hate it and wasn't miserable. But the next morning, when we were walking down Michigan for enormous breakfasts at the Artist Restaurant, and I was pointing out the Hyatt and other hotels I'd stayed in over almost three decades of visiting the Windy City, she casually referred to the Hilton as \"our home in Chicago\". The deal was done, the score settled: the Hilton Towers is her favorite Chicago hotel, and it is unlikely that we will ever stay anywhere else when we come here. This is a lovely hotel, gigantic and fully earning its four stars in every respect. Everything there seems to be new, and in great condition, from the fancy coffee makers in the rooms to the carpet in the elevator lobbies. It all seemed new to me when I stayed there three years ago, and yet it looked new now. I get the impression that the place is in a state of perpetual, tasteful refurbishment. Not bad for a hotel that dates to 1927. We had booked three rooms at a highly discounted rate: a single for my mom, a double for my sister and her son, and another double for my daughter and me. As we checked in, I mentioned to my mom that if it was available, I wanted to upgrade my room so that my teenage daughter could have her own bathroom. (Yes, we are spoiled, and so are our children. Mom is well aware of the fact that I and my three siblings grew up in a one-bathroom home that had a tub but not a shower, and that we all turned out just fine.) I don't know if the young woman who was checking us in had overheard me, or if we were just lucky, but all three rooms were upgraded at no additional charge to two-bathroom status. Mom was flustered but also kind of thrilled: extra bathrooms DO make us feel special. All of our rooms were equipped with luxury bedding -- quality cotton, warm comforters, fine pillows. The beds were made well. This is important to me. I have stayed in hotels where the beds were sloppily made up, or where the sheets were thin and/or clearly made of cheap man-made fibers and/or not big enough for the bed.(Seriously, just ask me about the $950/night suite that overlooked Niagara Falls --- great view, ridiculous bedding. Don't get me started.) At the Hilton, the beds are made for luxiourious, fabulous sleeping. My daughter looked forward to and once again loved sleeping there, and yesterday, our first day home, she began lobbying me about getting sheets, comforters and pillows for her room to duplicate the Hilton experience here at home. (Fat chance.) The weather was vile that night, and that's an understatement. The concierge suggested several places for dining with teenagers, but they were all at least six blocks away, and we would have been drenched just getting into a cab. We opted for staying in and ordering a pizza. We passed a quiet night, given the wild fury of the winds just outside our windows. My sister and mom said they heard nothing at all during the night. I was in a different wing of the hotel, and I heard the wind, the el, and the sounds that a hotel makes that can be heard on the 18th floor. These were soothing sounds, and my daughter and I slept well. We loved the HBO. Didn't use it this time, but we liked the indoor pool on previous visits. BYO H2O... the bottles supplied by the hotel are $7 each. Seriously. Views vary. My mom's room had a view of the Shedd and the planetarium, if you stood in a particular spot near the window and craned your neck. My room looked out at windows identical to my own, as did my sisters. But we weren't there for the views. Most importantly, we felt safe at the Hilton. Yes, we spent just a small amount of time there, just enough time to watch a movie (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and sleep (very well, thank you). But if we hadn't felt safe we would have found another place to stay or would have just gone home to Grand Rapids, MI. In the morning before we checked out we explored the hotel's ballrooms, reception areas and convention facilities. This is an historical property, and we enjoyed our wanderings very much. The grand ballroom is an architectural as well as an engineering marvel. I recommend this hotel if you're traveling alone, with family or with multiple generations; if you're interested in Chicago history or architecture; if you need a place close to the museums; if you're looking for something romantic, or if you want someplace to stay with your kids. For me, the Chicago Hilton is simply the best possible shelter in this wonderful city, a place that makes me and my children feel welcome, pampered, and that we deserve every good thing. So my mom is right: The Chicago Hilton is, absolutely, our home in Chicago.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cStay Elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "BigdawgChicago", "ReviewID": "UR14948255", "Content": "I live in the Chicago suburbs and stayed here for a weekend to attend a company meeting. I am mystified by the favorable reviews so many people have given. Maybe I stayed on the worst floor in the hotel or some visitors are so in love with Chicago that it carries over to their reviews of the Hilton. I wouldn't want to stay here if I was from out of town, not with all the nicer hotels in Chicago. The halls are decorated from the 1950's, the hallway carpeting and wallcovering are dated, worn out and ugly and smelled. The couches and chairs near the elevators on my floor haven't been replaced in decades. The room was very small and very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable. As another reviewer noted, the heat/AC really couldn't be regulated and the room was very warm. I opened the window only to find that the EL trains sounded like they were going under my bed, even though they were 2 blocks away. My company has offices and conference rooms literally next to the EL and the noise in the hotel room was ten times wosre than in my office. I would suggest you do not stay on the west side of the hotel, especially if ytou have trouble sleeping. The $41 parking is highway robbery and the restaurant is overpriced.

If shopping on the Mag Mile and frequenting the nice restaurants (or bars) in River North or the Gold Coast areas are high on your list, I'd stay somewhere closer to those areas (like Wacker/Michigan, Streeterville, North Loop, Mag Mile, or the Water Tower area). It is quite a trek to those areas if you are walking. Cabs are faster but can add up. Our room had two beds and two bathrooms and that was fine wih me (I love having my own bathroom so I can spread my things out).

After an \"investigation\" to determine whether the locking mechanism had failed or not, they determined that they were not responsible. I was in shock initially. We're talking about a 3rd generation 20 gb iPod here. The insurance company's argument was simple; they were not responsible period. They said that as part of their investigation they had interrogated their staff and found them completely innocent of any wrongdoing. As if anyone would own up to that. What a wonderful world we'd live in indeed. I asked the agent to let ME interrogate them to which they responded with no. I made it clear to them that regardless of their policy they had essentially accused me of lying and fraud. Their agent did their best to deflect that statement but the definition was a black and white one. Now, I do quite well in my profession and could purchase my own iPod.

When you are sold a lake view, you will be able to see the lake but don't be fooled like we were and expect a full 180-degree view. Like I said, the room decor and bathroom were nice but a bit aged. The bed was quite comfortable though, and there were lots of windows. We were at the end of a hall and were not at all disturbed by any noise. Room wise, we really don't have any complaints but don't have anything to rave about either. OK. Two complaints. The bathroom sink did not drain well. But, the bathroom had a large frosted window that let in lots of wonderful, natural light. Also, my wife found lots of spiders (6-8) in our room. The guy that checked us in was very nice but gave us misinformation about finding late night dining. The rest of the staff was quite pleasant except for the very grumpy gentlemen that work the baggage check counter. Watch out for them. Even a nice tip hardly evoked any friendliness. We only had one meal at the hotel. We ate at Buckingham's. The service was friendly but VERY slow, and the food while tasty, ended up making us both ill. We complained about it at check-out, and the hotel manager did credit us back for half of the dining bill which was nice. The hotel is in a decent location right next to Grant Park. But for most everything including getting food, we had to walk quite a way. There are other hotels in slightly more convenient locations such as Palmer House. Chicago Recommendations: We love Chicago in the summer! There are so many great events. If I had to recommend one thing to do there, it would be to rent bikes. The city is flat with excellent walking and bike paths for navigating the parks and lake front. The fireworks are fun too. Watch them from Navy Pier or next to Alder Planetarium or from a charter sail boat. We really enjoyed sailing with Windy City Sailing! Also check out the free dance lessons and dancing in Grant Park. Just arrive early so as not to miss the start of the lesson and grab some chairs. If you want to grab a cheap bite to eat close to the Hilton Chicago, there is a good little bar called South Loop Club at the corner of Balboa and State which is open until late. The best steakhouse is Chicago Chop House. Make a res. and eat there. We took the Blue Line to the Loop and then a cab from there but probably could have walked. It was fun taking the train, and we avoided traffic and saved some money. For a great deal on pricey Chicago hotels, use Priceline.com. We have had great success.

It took the hotel 1 hour to get me a rollaway bed and another 1.5 hours to get me pillows and a blanket. They had claimed that the rollaway was as good as a regular bed at the front desk as well as promised that it would be complimentary. In reality, it was actually more of low sofabed quality and I had to go in person to the front desk at checkout to get the charge for it removed. To their credit, the front desk did give me a complimentary breakfast coupon and were generally very helpful. In addition, the location is convenient for the Park, buses, and not that far from the El station. Echoing one of the other reviewers, there were spiders outside the window even on the 20+ floors, and the outside of the windows was not that clean. They did charge for WiFi access. Basically, this hotel needs to enforce nonsmoking in their rooms. As it stands, there are not even prominently placed \"No Smoking\" signs and no \"There will be a $500 cleaning fee if you smoke in the room\" signs. If the hotel fixes their smoking problems, it would be a solid 4* hotel.

Coffee packets for in-room brewing systems are $3.25 (for a single serving pod)! It also cost me $3.50 for seven minutes of internet. There was a bottle of water next to the television on the dresser that had a $6.00 price tag! I'm surprised they didn't charge for ice in the ice machines. The hotel boasts four great restaurants, but these prices are also radically high. My friend and I ate dinner at Kitty O'Sheas in the hotel and were surprised when we realized that beers cost $6.50 a piece! (This is more expensive than beers at a White Sox game). Chicago is a relatively cheap city. There is no reason to charge those prices. One would expect a first-rate hotel like the Hilton to at least offer free internet access! (I know that the Holiday Inn does!). I also must complain about the unfriendliness of the staff. Several of the employees were arrogant and just plain rude. When I asked for the key to the mini-bar, the attendant asked for my I.D. (which is fine), but then insisted that I wasn't 21 (I'm 26). It turns out she was reading the expiration date on my license instead of the birthdate. Then she claimed that my I.D. looked fake. I guess she's never seen a Texas driver's license before. I was in town for a professional conference and didn't appreciate being treated like a kid trying to sneak into an R rated movie. Speaking of kids, for the first few days of my stay, the hotel was crawling with teenagers! (There was some sort of High School Student Government convention going on in the hotel). They were everywhere! Goofing around with the elevators, sleeping on the couches in the lobbies, running down the halls screaming and giggling at 2am! Each group of teenagers was followed by equally troublesome adult chaparones, that screamed and yelled orders at the kids. It was mayhem. (I realize that it wasn't the hotel's fault, but it was an annoyance). The hotel also hosted a local prom on Saturday night. The nearest subway stop was closed and I was forced to either walk five blocks to the next stop or take a cab. The concierge informed me that this particular subway stop always seems to close down on the weekends. If you must stay at the hotel (if you're attending a conference for instance) then here are some tips: stop at Walgreen's which is only a couple of blocks away and buy drinks and snacks to stock your hotel room.

She told me it would be difficult to find, but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers, tucked into a very dark corner, facing a wall of rooms. I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request, but to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit tight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and someone would call me. No one did. Further calls yielded similar results.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real hospitality for you. Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave, I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. (I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds.) The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms. Other than that, it was tight quarters with a tiny closet, two uncomfortably low chairs, at the desk and in a (dark) corner. Light fixtures didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much to brighten things up. Since I was here at a conference, I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail, but instead I got a cave.

This was my first time at the Chicago Hilton. I must say that the hotel is very elegant and has a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charm to it. All the ballrooms are huge and the second floor reception area is beautiful. That being said, I felt that the sheer size of the hotel made it a little bit impersonal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a summary of my experience- Check-In- There was a long line when I got there but the line moved fast and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait too long. The lady at the counter was very professional but seemed impersonal (yes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I used that word again). Room- The room itself was a little small (plus I got stuck with a view of the AC vent) and the bathroom really needed to be renovated. Again, it reminded me of the older hotel rooms of the 80s a little. The room itself was tastefully decorated and the bed was comfortable (although the king bed was much smaller than any king I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen). Food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I must say that I was very disappointed with the food at this hotel. First of all, I called for room service at 11pm one night and they told me they were closed. So I tried the Pavilion and the food there was mediocre to say the least. I tried Kitty O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sheas one night but that place gets quite crowded and it gets smoky as the night progresses so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stick around too long. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many other restaurants in walking distance so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to take a cab and explore the city for great places to eat. I went to a place called The MK Restaurant, which I would highly recommend. I eat out in NY all the time and have seldom found placed outside NY that I am that impressed by\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this place was one. Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I absolutely loved the location of this hotel! The park is right in front and the hotel is in walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions. They even provide a free shuttle to the Magnificent Mile. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one really good reason to pick this hotel, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in the middle of things and therefore it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not noisy, yet you can get almost anywhere walking (or in a 5 minutes cab ride). Overall, I had a pleasant stay at the hotel. There is a lot to do and see in Chicago. This hotel is well located and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor/overall feel of the hotel is elegant, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always nice returning back to the hotel.

The Chicago Hilton has 3 main restaurants - Kitty O'Sheas (Irish), Buckinghams (American/Steak, dinner only), and Pavilion (American, 24-hours). I was surprised that soda/coffe/tea was more than $3 at the Pavilion! The \"Exotic Fruit\" dessert at Buckingham's was fantastic - a huge plate of exotic fruit with chocolate souce for dipping - well worth the $8 price and large enough to share. The 4th \"restaurant\" is the Lakeview Lounge, which serves Starbucks coffee in the mornings and alcohol at night. All in all, we enjoyed our visit.

We were on the King Tut package booked through the hotel, and it was a VERY good move. Our tickets were express tickets that did not specify a time to visit the Field Museum. We could enter the exhibit anytime with the exception of 2 blackout weekend times that did not affect us. Plus the tickets allow you to enter from the South entrance rather than the East entrance which is the primary entrance for the Tut exhibit. The lines at the East entrance were ridiculous, so we felt very lucky. The weird thing was that the hotel gave us 6 tickets to the exhibit when we arrived, and there are only 2 of us. We could have gone through the exhibit 3 times each if we had wanted. I am not sure if this is standard practice or a fluke. The hotel is in a great location if you are visiting the Museum Campus, Millenium Park, Grant Park, etc. It is walking distance to shopping if you really like to walk. We didn't find a lot of local restaurants nearby, and we tended to eat while we were out and about. The El was only a short walk away, though, and taxis were always lined up at the entrance to take you anywhere you wanted to go. Overall, I wasn't blown away by the hotel, but I can't find anything specific and horrible to complain about.

We were on the 11th floor in a 2 bed room with two bathrooms. The main bathroom was very nice, but the additional shower room was very badly designed, with the door opening into the shower so much that you had to press yourself up against the shower wall to get enough space to close it. The room was clean and the beds and bedding very nice and comfortable. The concierge who I think was called Donald was one of the most helpful people I have come across and he helped us book tickets to see the Cubs play at Wrigley Field and offered a whole host of advice re transport etc. The worst parts of the hotel I would say is the pool, its so overpowering with chlorine, that you can smell it as soon as you exit the lifts on the 8th floor, if I had been staying on this floor I would have asked to have been moved, due to this. As for Buckinghams, the waiting staff are very polite to begin with, but if you leave a less than adequate tip (which we did as they had forgotten a coule of things off our order), we were asked in a very surly tone if things had been ok, they were obviously not impressed with out 10% tip... rather than a 15 - 20% tip, this ruined what had been an ok dining experience and I wouldn't eat in this restaurant again, due to this. Kitty O'Sheas was very good, we had a couple of snacks in here, the service was good and the live music also very good. As for location, its ideal for Grant Park, The Shedd Aquarium, Museums and Planatarium/Soldier Field etc, but a little out of the way of the shops/river, having said this the free shuttle bus which leaves on the hour every hour was very very useful and we used this several times. Tips for the Tourist Sites: Dont pay to go up the Hancock Centre, instead go to the bar a couple of floors down, which is free entry and spend the money on a cocktail! If you visit the Cheesecake Factory, you will have a wait, but it was worth it, dont orders starters though as the portions are huge, you will never finish it all... save room for the cheescake. The Spirit of Chicago Dinner Cruise was very average, the food was poor and the entertainment very holiday camp standard, however the firework display and the views of the skyline were very good. The architectural boat cruises were very good, a nice way to spend 1.5 hours. If you intend to shop in Bloomingdales, visit the Guest Information Desk first, they will give you a 10% voucher for any purchases you make on the day over $50, and they also have some very useful maps and booklets of where to shop, where to dine etc, I found these booklets really good and better than the ones available in the hotels. Do try to get to see a baseball game, the EL or subway train will take you right to the ground. We also found a lovely little place for breakfast behind the Hilton at 75 West Harrison Street, its called Orange and the fresh fruit and pancakes and freshly squeezed juices are really worth the 5 minute walk from the Hilton for breakfast, the staff are friendly and the place is nice and relaxed, several pieces of local artwork on the walls... all of it for sale also make it interesting, definitely worth a visit. The beach is good for a hot day, take something to sit on as we didnt manage to find any sun loungers or chairs to hire. One thing I would recommend you to do is The House of Blues, Gospel Brunch, this was really fun, the food good and the Gospel Singers were fantastic, book ahead for this one to make sure you get in.

The fitness center, which is very nice for a hotel, was $13 per day!!! It certainly wasn't that nice - I think the indoor track was probably 1/16 of a mile - not great for a runner. I actually managed to get exchange privledges for the FitPlex gym on State street which was absolutely fabulous. The pool (and the tiny track) are free but the pool was closed the first dy we were there. Now that wasn't the hotel's fault, as a child had contaminated it, but they should have allowed guests to use the fitness center at a discounted rate since the pool was unavailable to swim laps. Frankly, the girl working the desk was rude when I made that comment, even though I was polite to her. Additionally, like many travelers, although I checked out in the morning, my flight wasn't until the evening. I have never before had a problem storing luggage at the hotel. At the Hilton Chicago you had to go to the 2nd floor (not the bellman) and pay to have your bags stored. Granted, it wasn't expensive but it seems ridiculous given what you pay per night that they feel the need to charge $1.50 per bag. At the end of the day, I probably wouldn't go back.

The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk to Sears Tower and about 5-10 minutes to the Shedd Aquarium and Lake Michigan (through Grant Park).

I've stayed here several times, and have some wonderful memories of family events here. It's definitely one of the grand old hotels, and relatively well kept up. However it seems like there are so many better choices in Chicago. On my last two stays we've been upgraded (Hilton Hhonors diamond level) to the executive floors and had great views of the lake. The executive floor lounge has drinks and snacks in the afternoon and continental breakfast in the morning. Both are average and comparable to the same at any other hotel. The lounge room itself isn't anything special. The rooms on both of the past two stays were very small, although I've had bigger rooms in the hotel without lake view. The bedding and decorating in the bedrooms are typical Hilton and fairly new. The TV is comically large for such a small room. The bathrooms were updated at some point with marble floors and countertops, but it looks like it was probably in the 1980's because of the gold trim faucets and fixtures which look very out of date now. On top of that the finish isn't holding up very well. My biggest complaint with my most recent stay is that there is NOTHING available in the hotel for eating after 10 PM. except room service, and even that is very limited. I returned from the theatre at 10, expecting to be able to at least get a sandwich in the bar, but no. I wanted to ask the concierge to recommend something in the neighborhood, but nobody was working at that desk. The front desk had one employee and about 5 people in line. I finally asked a person at the bell stand, and he said there was a bar two blocks back, but that looked too seedy to me. So the only choice was room service, and that was extremely limited and of course had all the extra costs associated with it. I'm really surprised that such a large hotel, with the level of service that this one promises, couldn't do better. For this reason alone, I think I'll stop using this hotel while I still have SOME nice memories of times there. One final note: parking here, like any of the downtown Chicago hotels is expensive. There is a private parking garage directly behind the hotel on Wabash St. that has 24 hr parking w/ in & out for $21. It's almost as close as parking in the hotel, and about half the price.", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herndon, VA", "Title": "\u201cWon't stay here again...give me a Marriott any day!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4615771", "Content": "I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending. Before I arrived I tried to find out about the \"In Room Fitness\" program advertised on the corporate website. I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. I explained that I was inquiring about the 'In Room Fitness' advertised on their website. She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly. I did and got the same response. I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. Again, this was a problem. When I arrived at the hotel, no treadmill was available. When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm. When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge $13 per day to use the fitness equipment. The pool, track and locker room are free, but to use the treadmills, etc. you have to pay $13 per day. This charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website, not in any of the guest service materials in the room. The food for the conference was mediocre, but the one room service meal I had was pretty good. During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn't hear the speaker. The HVAC didn't work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay. The beds were comfortable with very nice linens. I tried to get a late checkout, which was offered on a card in my room. The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour, not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room. The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office. The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms, so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldn't carry it out of the hotel.

Let me start with the great things. Number one is the service, everyone we met provided outstanding service from the bell staff to the Pavillion waiter. I was espically impressed with the Towers Floor Concierge Oscar. Not that my questions and requests of him was all that burdensome, but getting to observe him with other guests while relaxing in the lounge made me wish every hotel had an Oscar. But overall, the entire staff exhibited a Four Seasons level of service. The first disappointing thing was the room itself. It was a very small room (2341) with no view of anything other than other rooms directly across from it. Also while it did have a desk it was too small to have a table or any other way for 2 people to have an in-room dinner. On the plus if not unusual side it did have two bathrooms. At first I brushed off this knowing that the hotel can only have so many lake view, or city view rooms. Then I met other guest who were loving their fantastic lakeview room the booked through Priceline for about half the price I was paying for mine (and we're Hilton Gold members to boot.) They said they got it since the hotel was at such low occupancy. The low occupancy was my other disappointment, although I can't blame the hotel for that. Because of the slow period one of my to-do things, dinner at their steakhouse Buckinghams, was skipped because Buckinghams was closed during our stay. The Pavillion was certainly good sandwich fare, but no steakhouse. Also because of the low occupancy their free shuttle to the downtown shopping area wasn't running either. The last disappointment, and I don't want to make too big a deal about these, is the nickle and dimeing the hotel has taken to. First the $32 parking fee another reviewer referenced is now $38 ($41 for valet), late check out (even with low occupancy) is $25 and if you want the bellstaff to hold your bags for you that is another $1.50 per bag. This has to the first time I've ever seen that charge at any hotel, I hope it doesn't catch on. To finish on a good note, because there is more good than disapponts, the room and entire hotel was extremely clean and well furnished. We had a large flat screen TV, very plush bedding with a least a half dozen pillows, and housekeeping kept the room well stock with their evening turndown service.

The only downside to the Hilton Towers is that the location is poor for shopping and the neighborhood is not desirable. Also, we had a hard time hailing a cab after the concert at the United Center.

Having read the reviews I was a bit concerned but to be honest it is not that bad. Good bits: We arrived on Labour day and check in was speedy. First impressions of the hotel are fantastic - on entry you walk into a very grand opening with steps on each side leading up to pianos and a terrace overlooking the park. You certainly get the feel of staying somewhere expensive and elaborate. All of the public areas are clean and for such a huge hotel it is a bit of a comfort to see security guards patrolling around. Our room on the 19th floor was at the back of the hotel but we still had a great view of the Sears Tower at night. Our room was more than big enough and the television was a huge widescreen (I only mention this because a previous reviewer mentions the TV as being small!). The bathroom was big enough for two of us to be in there at the same time. It was clean with plentiful hot water. The hotel is across the street from Grant Park and the Buckingham Fountain. You can also walk a little further up to Millenium Park. It is also close to the shops on State Street and some great pub/diner places on South Wabash. There is also a free shuttle that will take you up to the shopping on North Michigan. Not so good bits: The hotel is so huge it can feel a little impersonal. Didn't really bother us but I can see how others would be irritated by this. On our second and third days the Hotel hosted a nurses convention and a printers convention. The lobby was just packed the whole time with people on mobile phones. If you are a tourist looking for personal service and peace and quiet this may not be the place for you. Although in a nice location the hotel really is out of the way for most of the \"tourist\" type things, nice restuarants and shopping. We are young and fit so didn't have a problem walking up to the North in the day but I can see how the location of the hotel could be a hinderance for the less mobile. Having said that we didn't really venture too far out at night - only a few blocks to eat - as it is definately quieter once the sun sets. The bad bits: $13 to use the fitness facilities. A cheek given the cost of the hotel in the first place. $1.50 per bag to store your luggage. Again, we consider this to be unreasonable. You would think such things would be complimentary?? The room service and restuarant costs. It was something like $15 for two eggs for breakfast. Take my advice - walk a block to Starbucks or the nearby Corner House Bakery!

The way to the elevator hall was sided with tacky display of shop arcades. I find it really cheap to see these features on the lobby level. On each floor, the corridors were really grand and wide stretched endlessly but the features were from 80s and looking tired and again with tacky carpet colors. The room we got was cornered to have the view over the lake, and the park in-between, but, that particular spot in the corridor had a very unpleasant piss smell with wet floor. I guessed someone pissed in the floor and the cleaning staff did not notice it while they clean the rooms. Or, they have simply too many rooms and could not check the same spot everyday. The room size(deluxe) was excellent but again, looking tired with this sour smell from an old room I believe. And I demanded them to come and clean the windows as there were some greasy hand marks and faces/lips. Instead of changing the room immediately, they said they would send a cleaning crew to recheck the rooms. When I got back after 11pm, still the same, and I was roaring one the phone demanding them to clean the windows and desanitize the air in the room and in the corridor. And, the receptionist instead of apologizing, was saying that 'I should understand this was an old hotel.' I understood old tired features unlike other HIlton hotels I have been to, but I could not compromise with cleanliness. Eventually, the director stepped in and deducted my cost with double points, but, it was too late. It spoiled my mood already. I am sure this is a good deal for the group travelers.

The first room I was in was small, but sufficient for one person. The king bed was VERY comfortable and I had a lovely view to the lake. However, during the weekend live music was playing until late into the night - all of which could be heard in my room while I was trying to go to sleep. Unfortunately, the bathtub didn't drain very well (several other people also mentioned this while I was there). Furthermore, halfway through my stay, my neighbors decided to turn up their TV to full volume. I could hear it loud and clear over my television. I called security and they came up. Of course, nobody answered the door so security called downstairs and advised about the situation (they even mentioned that the noise level was obscenely high - you could hear it all the way down the hall). The noise continued despite repeated phone calls by security. I finally asked to be moved to another room only to be initially told that no other rooms were available. I was put on hold and magically one opened up. I was moved downstairs to another room with a king bed. This room was much larger, with two large windows overlooking the lake. Overall, I was pleased with the rooms (especially since the tub in the second room drained normally). However, the service left something to be desired. The second day I was there nobody showed up to clean the room. I finally called at 4 pm and was told that someone should have already been there. They came up after I called. The next day the same thing happened. I think the housekeeping service thought I was calling for additional services but in reality I was calling because I never had service to begin with. The third day they still hadn't cleaned. By the time someone came up after I called, I told them to forget it because I was in for the night. A stop at the front desk fixed the problem for the remainder of the week. The AC was frightfully inadequate in the meeting rooms and foyer of the hotel. It was very hot and humid in Chicago and many of us sweated inside the hotel. When asked about the temperature in the meeting rooms, we were always told it was a \"union problem.\" We were lucky if things got fixed within a few hours. The food at the meal functions was mediocre at best, despite the fact that the meals were supposed to be high end. We waited 30 minutes between finishing our salads and being served the main course. Some of the serving plates and cups were filthy - see photo of \"clean coffee cup.\" Waitstaff was brusque (union employees).

Then, they said they couldn't guarantee me a non-smoking room for the remaining three nights I'd be there. As an asthma sufferer, I was appalled. A friend who had stayed at the Hilton warned me that they'd treated her the same way, that she'd been given a smoking room when she'd requested a non-smoking room. We both had similar experiences: the rooms wreaked of smoke, and opening the windows didn't help. When I ran the shower, the smoke smell intensified. I spent the night with the covers over me, blocking out the smell, and suffering from a tight chest and a runny nose. They had promised to put an ionizer in the room, but that never happened. The only thing they did to accommodate me was reduce the rate of the room. In the morning, I got this non-apologetic message on my phone, telling me they'd be unable to change the room. Then they lied and said my reservation never specified a non-smoking room. Livid, I called the front desk, told them I had asthma, that I did in fact have a reservation for a non-smoking room, and that their policy of overbooking rooms was a disgrace. I guess my complaints had some effect, because a half hour later, I was transferred to a non-smoking room. Considering how expensive the Hilton Chicago is, I should not have had to work this hard to get a comfortable room. I later found out that they were giving other non-smokers smoking rooms, even the day before I arrived! I hope this review alerts hotels to the fact that they should honor reservations, and not overbook. Plus, they should think about converting more of their smoking rooms to non smoking rooms.

The Hilton Chicago was able to book us the following day and were able to keep us in the same room. Quite impressive when the American Medical Association was holding their conference in the hotel. They still found room for us. No need to move. I'm really not much for big cities and crowds so while my husband was away for the day on Friday, I stayed in the hotel. The room was so comfortable, I probably wouldn't have left, but the housekeeper talked me into enjoying myself outside of the room too. She was very sweet and most informative about the area. She was the one that told me the hotel offered a free shopping shuttle that ran all day long. Even though I didn't go, I thought that was a great feature since getting around that city is almost impossbile unless you're on foot. The pool area on the 8th floor was very nice, even though it was an indoor pool, there is a great sun deck just off the pool area. There is nothing in the hotel directory letting you know about this deck. I wish I would have known earlier in the day, because that is what I really wanted to do. The room was beautiful, but it was the bed that would make me come back for sure. It was absolutely the most comfortable hotel bed my husband and I have ever slept in. Another nice touch were the books and magazines that outlined everything to do (and eat) in the city. There was also a book written by Mr. Hilton himself that outlined the generations of his family and the history of the Hilton chain which I enjoyed very much. I would have liked to have bathrobes provided especially with that caliber of room. The view was, well - there wasn't one unless you like looking at the side of a brick building.

It has a lot of wonderful things going for it. The location is very good - on Michigan Ave, across from the largest park in Chicago and very close to the lake and to a number of bars and restaurants. The rooms were well appointed, though a little tight. Linens, furniture and other appointments were rather nice. The beds were extremely comfortable. The best part of the hotel relates to its history. When it was built (I think in the 20's or 30's), it was the largest hotel in the area. Be sure to look up when you first enter, as the high ceiling features an enormous, elegant mural, detailed accents and beautiful lighting. I nearly missed it the first two days, never having looked up!! So why only 4 stars? A couple of reasons. First, though elegant, rooms were somewhat tight. This was expected, but still I think of this as a negative. Primarily, though, the service was lackluster. I asked for a king room with a rollaway (there were 3 of us), booked the hotel months ago, and was told no such rooms were available. We had to check our bags and come back a few hours later, and then the only king room was extremely small, so we settled for a room with two doubles - not a great option for two tall people and their daughter. What bothered me was the very clear secondary way we were treated. The hotel had conventions, and we, being of a smaller party, were clearly not that important. One shining light - the bellman was extremely helpful, and brought us complimentary wine and cookies. He seemed genuinely concerned and helpful. Also, a goofy practice - the bell desk will not check computers. They were going to let us walk around town for hours with our computers, until they relented after our plea. Housekeepers were very friendly and courteous. A sidebar - I will never understand the unwillingness of a hotel to take the extra effort to confirm the room type requested at reservation. I understand that they cannot guarantee such things, as many things could interfere - accidents, repairs, guests overstaying their reservation. What they should and CAN do, though, is slot you for such rooms, if available when reserved, with some caveat (\"...unless certain things interfere, like X, Y or Z\"). I used to market reservation systems, so I know they can do this. They choose not to, which is disappointing. OK, a little off topic, sorry! The breakfast restaurant was good - a wide assortment on the breakfast buffet, omelette station, and menu items, with good service. It's a little pricey, but not above \"Chicago prices.\" The Irish bar, whose name I forget, was fun, though they always seemed understaffed, so service was slow. Plus, they close at 1a, in a town with a 4am curfew - what's up with that? While in Chicago, we dined at Spiaggias. Outstanding food, though the portions made French restaurants look generous by comparison. Also, try the South Loop Club, not too far, a good \"regular\" bar with fun people working it. We also went to the White Sox at their \"new\" ballpark - great time, easy to get to via subway. I do recommend this hotel, particularly with discount rates (we paid $80/night).

The hotel is huge and very crowded--lots of families and large groups. Still, if you ask for a quiet room the hotel is large enough that it's easy to get away from the hubbub. Be aware that when you book those great rates, however, they usually don't offer a view of Grant Park and the lake. According to the lady at the front desk this is $25 extra. Sure, the hotel is a tad worn here and there, but the \"bad\" elements of the hotel's age (carpet a bit faded in the hallways, electrical outlets and light switches yellowed) are far outweighed by the good, which gives the hotel its grandeur and elegance. The lobby area is classy yet not too stuffy, mostly because the throngs of people that inhabit it are obviously tourists. I didn't visit any of the hotel's restaurants or bar although I thought they looked equally elegant--like something from a movie (and probably very pricey). As for the room, the bed definitely was a highlight: quality comforter and linens, plush pillow top mattress and pillows. I slept great, and the room they gave me was very quiet. I had just a regular-sized room with a king bed and I thought it was plenty roomy in line with what I paid. Didn't have any of the climate-control problems referenced here in other posts. Large TV, big bathroom with lots of marble, and the water pressure in the shower was one of the best I've ever had at a hotel. My main beef with the hotel aside from the rather crowded and chaotic public areas had to do with the business center. Sorry, Hilton, but it's time to bring this element of your hotel into the 21st Century. Guests want 24-hour access to the internet and it should be free as is done at the Hilton Garden Inn across the river. I like to print out my airline boarding passes at the hotel before I ever get to the airport, but this was not possible at this hotel. For one thing, the business center has very limited hours--I had to leave for the airport in the morning before the place even opened. Second of all, the Hilton charges $6 per every 15 minutes of internet use. Not an incentive for me to make a return visit when other hotels charge nothing. Finally, the computer stations themselves did not appear to be in very good condition--all but one of the computers and printers didn't even look operational to me. More attention definitely needs to be given in this area. But all in all, I enjoyed staying in a hotel with \"history\" and character that for the most part has been kept up pretty well.

We booked for two adults and one child. Upon making my reservation, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a executive level room, for a fair price. I agreed. Upon getting to the room, it contained one kind size bed. There was no place for my child to sleep. No other rooms were available, so we had to bring in a roll away bed, which took up whatever remaining floor space was in this already too small room. There was a large chair which protruded from the desk, and would not fit under it, that took up the remaining floor space. I walked into that thing at least a dozen times. The room was HOT. We turned off the heat, opened the windows for the whole stay, and we were still uncomfortable. There were numerous dirty dishes sitting outside of rooms, many remained late into the next morning, when we saw them there the night before. There was continental breakfast (6-9) and evening hor devors (5-7) for executive level rooms. I am someone who prefers bottled water to a morning coffee and was pleased to find they offered it, the first day only. After that, they said they ran out, and it was never offered for the rest of the weekend. Food options are limited and/or expensive in the restaurants. Really nothing for children, at all. Altho, they will make you a 6.00 grilled cheese for the asking. I had Sheppards Pie at Kitty O'Sheas on evening. It was WONDERFUL! The best thing about this hotel was the BED~ Best Hotel Bed Ever!

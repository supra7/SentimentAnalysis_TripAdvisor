We had the time of our lives! We stayed in room 250, which is spacious and impeccably clean. Every staff member we encountered from front desk to housekeeping, were courteous and friendly. Mom and my sister each won $100 in comps in their daily drawings. Victoria Room restaurant was busy, but the service was good and the food was too. The Steak House was amazing, service was excellent and so was the food. We were on the Strip side of the building, so yes, there's some street noise, but that's to be expected - it's Las Vegas. The hotel's location is right in the middle of it all, so we weren't bothered by that, as we were out late anyway! Casino staff were also a lot of fun, especially the Blackjack dealers. We got our information wrong and missed all but a bit of the Fat Elvis show, but what we did see was pretty good - given that it's free, we can't complain about that :) The only criticism I have is that there is no coffee pot in the the room, and the restaurant does not offer coffee 'to go'. The bar does, but they don't have lids for the cups... the bartender directed me across the side-street to the Flamingo ($10.59 for 3 large cups of coffee - ouch!) Suggest bringing your own coffee pot or at least travel mugs if you need a morning caffeine fix. Still, if that's the biggest \"complaint\"... it's minor at best. I would definitely come here again. We enjoyed the smaller size of the hotel, and the friendliness.

It's on a very cool part of the Strip, and some of the rooms actually have a pretty good view of the Bellagio fountains. Also, compared to many of the other nearby hotels, it is pretty cheap. I stayed there many years ago for New Year's Eve, and it was perfect for that. Most of the other hotels are insanely expensive for New Year's Eve, but this place was reasonable. More recently, I stayed there for a couple of nights during the week. I had originally planned to stay there through the weekend, but we left after two nights because of the street noise. It can be pretty loud at night. In particular, there was a street musician playing the drums until after 2 AM. I could sleep through it, but my wife was tossing and turning. Even without the street drummer, it can be pretty loud with shouts and horns and sirens. Ear plugs would have been nice. I guess it depends on what your plans are. If you plan on spending most of your time out partying, then this might be the perfect place to stay. If you are planning to party all night and stumble back to the room at dawn to pass out, then the street noise really won't bother you, and you'll love the great location and cheap price. In our case, we wanted to go to sleep around midnight, and that just didn't work. As I said, after a couple nights we couldn't take it anymore switched hotels. We moved over to the Vdara, which was a little more expensive, but much, much better. Bill's has good prices, but I question the value. Be sure to compare other nearby options. In particular, check out the Flamingo next door. I've never stayed at the Flamingo, but looking at it from the outside it seems like the Flamingo might have some rooms with the same good view of the fountains, but without as much street noise. Or if you can go a little higher in your budget, you might want to check something like the Vdara. I thought that place was awesome, and a really good value. If you do stay at Bill's and you want a really good view, ask for a room close to the front corner of the building overlooking the fountains. We were in room 302, and it had a great fountain view. Room 402 would be even better. Our room was a smoking room, which was unfortunate. (They said that you can request a non-smoking room, but they can't guarantee it.) Our room didn't smell too much like smoke when we arrived, but I woke up the next morning to a strong odor of cigar smoke. I soon realized that the smell was coming from my pillow. I asked for fresh pillows, and I didn't have the problem the following morning. By the way, Bill's is a good place to park even if you aren't staying there. It's a small hotel, so the walk from the parking garage to the Strip is very short. In contrast, if you park at Paris, Bellagio, or Caesars, the walk from your car to the strip can take 10 minutes. The garage is small, but I have never seen it full. However, I'm sure it gets full sometimes. Gambling at Bill's is relatively cheap, too. After you lose your shirt at the big strip hotels, and you only have the change in your pockets left, head to Bill's to stretch your last few bucks.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DONCASTER", "Title": "\u201cWorth waiting for\u201d", "Author": "OLDBRITDoncaster", "ReviewID": "UR126558751", "Content": "On what is probably the last of our nine trips to Las Vegas (we can't take the ten hour flights from the UK any more) we finally got around to spending some time staying at Bill's.

This was our second and last time we will stay there. The location as always is great and the rooms clean and cheap but that's all it has going for it. We spent 5 nights there in Oct of 2010 and raved about it but either has new owners or managers and it has gone down hill since our last stay. After traveling for 17 hrs to get there we tried to check in at 3:15 pm and were told that there would be a $10 early check in fee as check in is not until 4 pm we were tired at wanted to clean up so we paid the gouge. .......Poor customer service I had visited their web site and noted that the breakfast special in the Victorian cafe of steak and eggs for $6.99 was on until 8 am. we had gone to bed early and were up by 5am cleaned up watched some local news on TV and got down for breakfast at 6:05 am 5 minutes too late for the special so live and learn we paid over double for the breakfast we could have had 5 minutes earlier. The next morning we would not make the same mistake and were down by 5 am only to be told there was a half hour wait not because it was so busy but because the manger had gone away and didn't have enough staff scheduled to work .............Poor managing. On our last trip to Bill's I had the Prime Rib 4 out of 5 night because it was great. This time I didn't see any advertising and ordered something un-memorable off the menu fter diner I mentioned this to the waiter and he brought us over a table add that showed the Prime Rib diner available 24hrs a day. Again live and learn but had the add been on our table as well I would have ordered it.The next day I ordered it and it was not as remembered, I received a tough, rubbery and fatty/ greasy hunk of meat more akin to a cheap prime rib steak than roast and a sad old baked potato that looked like it had been cooked days before...............Cheapened product. We played the slots and the payouts percentage were the worst of any casino we visited in our 5 nights in Vegas. Every other casino we went into and played had some payback but not at Bills it was take take take take and keep.............. Poor value Usually we would be able to get a drink / beer without problems but at Bill's we would order then about 45 min to an hour later the waitress would come by again apologize for forgetting us then return 15 minutes late apologize again and serve us our beer. We had tipped each and every time we had a beer delivered to us but that didn't matter either they were short staffed or the waitresses just weren't very good............Poor management. I had requested a quiet room away from Bill's and the Flamingo's air conditioning units the first 3 nights were fine but on our return they gave me a room with a constantly running toilet and non-stop air conditioning noise............ Poor customer service None of these complaints by themselves would make for a bad stay but when all combined it makes it so I will go elsewhere the next time down to Vegas. We spent over two thousand dollars in Bill's on rooms, the machines, in their restaurants and tips and we won't be back ..............

I've stayed at other bottom tier properties in Vegas (Imperial Palace, Riviera, Circus Circus), and didn't think that Bill's would be among them. I'd go back to IP before I'd stay here again. I arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon and attempted to check in. My travel agent said check-in time was 3:00; the front desk (and Bill's web site) says it was 4:00. Would I like to pay $10 for early check-in? Fine. My wife and I head up to the room. The elevators are creaky, and we exit onto the third floor. A stained marble shelf in the elevator lobby clearly used to have a vase bolted down to it -- the bolt hole and the round stain make that obvious. To my left, an ice machine with a semi-permanent handwritten \"out of order\" sign exudes class. We head to the room, open the door, and it's a smoking room. We'd requested non-smoking. We've got a view of the parking lot. There's no safe, no refrigerator, no closet. The bed's very firm. The shower head fixture is attached to the wall with lots of red putty; the cover for the connection is loose on the pipe. My wife wants to take a nap, and fortunately, we've got one more comped night at the Riviera to use (we thought we'd skip it and stay here, but that ain't happening). I drive her back, and then come back to Bill's at 4:30 to request a change to a non-smoking room. The front desk says they have none available, and that they don't guarantee such requests. Really? Maybe ask again tomorrow, he says. So if I'm understanding correctly, on a Sunday in early March, when there's no major events in town, there's no non-smoking rooms available for early check-in (fine, maybe they weren't clean yet?), and none after the regular check-in time either? And you can't assign me one that you'll know will be available tomorrow or the next day? Really? We stayed at the Riviera instead of Bill's on Sunday night. I dropped my wife at the airport on Monday morning, went to work, and returned on Monday night. By this time, I'd given up on the non-smoking issue.

I accidentally left my very expensive MP3 played in the room, it had fallen off the bedside table on the floor, so I forgot to pick it up when I left.

I called house keeping and they said they would check the room again - as the MP3 player hadn't turned up - and let me know via email which yet again they didn't. I would have thought a Vegas hotel would be used to dealing with lost property. However Bills did not 'Find' my item or give me the necessary assistance to lodge a claim with my insurance company.

We wanted an inexpensive, overnight stay before heading out the day after. We came and saw good reviews here on TripAdvisor, so we felt comfortable making this selection. Yes, this hotel is affordable and SO conveniently located in the heart of the strip. Yes, we had an incredible view of the strip (viewing south toward Paris, Bellagio, even the fountains). Yes, it is great to see all the lights and excitement of the strip. The room was clean and certainly decent enough. There is a lovely, large flat screen television on the wall. So, what's the gripe? We arrived at the hotel at 3:15 PM and began checking in with our reservation. We were greeted by a friendly staff member, who looked up our reservation and mused aloud \"Humm..that room isn't ready yet. Let me see what is.\" So, she found a room that was ready and moved forward with checking us in, taking a credit card for additional expenses. When the check-in was completed, she mentioned \"Oh, there is an additional $10.00 charge for checking in early.\" Check in time, apparently, is 4:00 PM. Our car was one flight up from the desk, we could have easily waited out the 45 minutes so as not to incur the extra charge. Ehh, $10, what the heck? So, we went up to our room, looked things over, enjoyed the view and the adequate interior. Nothing at all fancy, but we weren't there for a resort experience. Fine. Upon check out time the next morning, we went to check out using the option on our TV, only to notice that the early check in charge had gone from $10 up to $11.20. Huh? Ok, still not a lot of money, but we wanted to understand why. The hostess at the desk said, even after hearing that we were not told of the charge in advance said \"The $11.20 is the original $10.00 plus tax, which comes to $11.20. I'm sorry, but we cannot refund that, it is hotel policy. I am sorry that you were not told in advance, but we can't change it now.\" When looking at the receipt we were given, we say that there was not an itemized charge for the $1.20 tax like the rest of the bill, so this seemed a bit suspect. By nature, we are not people who complain, nor are we cheap. Still, this felt wrong. (We also learned in this discussion that Bill's is owned by Caesar's...good to know.) Here's the bigger beef. The hotel is located at the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Flamingo Road. Truly at the heart of the strip. We've stayed on strip facing properties on many, many occasions, but somehow, some way, the other hotels manage to mute the sounds of the strip. This was a Friday night, the entire strip was hopping. And hopping. AND HOPPING. The sounds were deafening! Loud music from the strip (we never were able to determine where the music was coming from..maybe an animated, brightly lit sign at Bally's?) The cars honking, the party people reveling at the street level, the endless sirens..ALL NIGHT LONG. The drunken revelers coming back to their rooms at 2, 3 and 4 AM. Loud, laughing, wall-pounding as they walked down the hallway, inconsiderate drunks. We're all for people having a good time, we realize that alcohol renders people less inhibited, but COME ON!! 4 AM screaming up and down the hall? We also understand that this is, in now way, the fault of the hotel itself. For these reasons, although we appreciate the prime location, the inexpensive but clean and decent room, we will not be staying here again. Better to spend more money for a good night's sleep. I will say that the staff member, Lisa, at the \"rewards\" desk was extremely friendly and helpfully chatty. :-)", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Independence, OR.", "Title": "\u201cJust what we were looking for!\u201d", "Author": "RUCP", "ReviewID": "UR124792540", "Content": "We just returned from 3 nights at Bill's.

But.. if you're a \"my hotel room is for sleeping in and I hate dragging my luggage through monstrous jungles of slots \" type, give Bill's a try. The room we had was bigger and better appointed than what others in our party had in Ceasar's, beds were comfy and tidy. (eg -We had 42\" flat screen tv, Caesar's still had a 27\" crt. Caesar's bathroom had no door, just a switch back hallway that echoed - kind of odd when you have a bunch of people in the room and someone has to use the facilities.). Our room was quiet, but we were on the back side of the hotel, so the view was back alley but we were never in the room long enough to care anyhow. Our whole group had fun in Bill's casino even though others were staying at Caesar's and The Mirage. If you're looking for Craps lessons, they have free lessons every day at 10:30 - try to get the older pit boss as a coach - he was hilarious without trying to be. I'm guessing he's seen a few things in his life there.. :) Fat Elvis was good for a laugh, everyone in the crowd was having fun. It's just a lot more low-key and friendly than what we saw in other casinos. If you want a suite, either for entertaining or just because you have a bigger group, apparently the John Wayne room is a hoot - it was supposedly built and decorated for him to stay in way back when and then he died just before he was supposed to stay there. Cowboy decor, leather and wood, 3 room suite for a few hundred $$/night. Might be worth asking about. Victorian restaurant was good, prices were reasonable and staff was helpful and friendly.

Room 312 which overlooked the strip. Let me start by saying I have read every review for Bills going back 6 months on Tripadvisor and can not believe what some people complain about. The noise from the street was a non issue. In fact, it was great watching all the people walking down the strip. We did not have any issues with street noise while going to bed. The elevators were not slow and I never waited more than 30 seconds for one. We had so much fun here. The place is full of hard working middle class people who would rather spend their money on gambling, drinks and shows than on their room. It was perfect for us. Why spend 200 or 300 a night for a place to pass out when Bills offers 60 dollar rooms with a perfect view? The room was nice size. Very clean. Little window in the bathroom that opens and you can people watch even while showering. I only turned the tv on to check out. It looked nice though. There is a huge dresser, a work desk and a table in the room along with 4 chairs. It served our needs well. The staff was very pleasant and I had no issues with any of them. Check in was quick with no wait and the elevators are within steps of the front desk. It was great to walk in this place and be in the room in a minute or two. The property is a little old but thats what I like about it. Nice looking wood work. It is in the center of it all. The only time we cabbed was to and from the airport. I didnt find the casino to be smoky like some people have said. There is karaoke at night and my wife and I had so much fun watching this. There is only one thing I did not like about Bills and that was their Victorian Room restaurant. We went here around 2 am after a hard day of drinking so everything should taste good at that point. We both got the steak and egg special for 6.99 and the steak was inedible. I realize that for 6.99, the steak would not be a prime cut but at least make it edible. All and all, great time.

I mean... what do you expect from an old old old building. Easy to navigate around but the elevators are slow....so what. The more time you are in the elevator then less time you loose money right? Still not too shabby. When you get out of the elevators, you make a quick turn to the right and there is the front desk. Check in was SUPER EASY. This was one of my wife's main reason for staying here. NO line queue. I mean the walked from the elevator, made the turn and walked right up to the Front desk agent. She was really nice and noticed it was my birthday. We received our keys and walked right up to our room. Room was everything we needed. Its not like we needed much due to we were not in the room, but to rest and shower. We had the 2 beds and we used one of the beds to lay out all of our clothes for the next day. The TV was a large flat screen and was above the 2 person dresser. There was a decent table and chairs right next to window were we had a view of the entrance to the Flamingo. The view was really cool at night when that huge sign was lit up. JUST FYI, they don't turn off that sign until 7am. The bathroom was kinda small, but it worked. There was a small stained glass window you can open in the shower. If you close it and take a hot shower, it steams up the small bathroom when the door is closed. It left sooooo good. We really liked this hotel because you can walk from your room down to the strip in less than 5 minutes. Unlike those huge resorts where you may have to walk through a mall or something. Even the check out was quick and easy. No wait on a Thursday afternoon and again walked right up. Normally other resorts have the Thurs-Sun crowds filtering in. There was only 2 issues we had. One was when the heater kicked on the vents would make a load noise, but it only lasted a few times each night. The other issue was that we called down to request more bath towels, and they said the maid service was out for the day and we needed to call again in the morning. 10 minutes later someone did bring up the towels we needed. All the people are super nice, the bar tenders are really cool and even the security will stop and talk to you if they are not doing anything at the moment. I would stay there again if need be.

The casino floor seems to be a favorite place for \"working girls\" to socialize in the early morning hours (i.e., 6-8). Some readers might be offended by this, while others will find it just another colorful aspect of the Vegas experience. In any event, forewarned is forearmed.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cNot for me.\u201d", "Author": "Reddy45", "ReviewID": "UR121610164", "Content": "I believe I am a very fair and reasonable person in most respects, so giving Bill's a Terrible rating is taking a lot of effort, but I need to review the hotel from my perspective for the benefit of other travelers (who may be like me). I'm not much of a gambler, so my review only covers the hotel. The major perk about Bill's that is echoed in many of these reviews is the location. You cannot get a better location that puts you literally minutes away from the big resorts (CityCenter aside). As a regular Vegas visitor who normally stays at MGM properties, I found that Bill's is easy to get into, easy to get out of, and easy to get back to. The size is also a perk somewhat because very little walking is required to go from your car in the parking garage to the casino, to the registration desk, to your room. The perks stop there, though. Now, before I begin, please realize that I am aware that travelers aren't staying at Bill's for the hotel, but many other reviews vaguely state something along the lines of \"the room was decent and good enough\", which is very loose for interpretation. For the benefit of others, I am going to highlight the issues that I observed during my stay. 1. The elevators can be extremely slow and in-use during peak periods. It was not abnormal to press the elevator button and then wait up to 5 minutes for it to finally arrive. There are only 3 floors of hotel rooms, so I can't really understand what would take them so long. 2. The room I was in exhibited a random thud or thunk noise many times per minute. When i first checked in I thought it was just noise from other guests, but when it continued all night long I investigated and it is tied to some machinery. It may be from the elevators or the heating/cooling system. Either way, it drove me nuts. 3. I'm pretty sure I booked a non-smoking room, but with the room I was given, I'm not really sure what I got. There is an obvious scent of 'cigarette smoke cover up' in the room that varies in intensity throughout the night. I also think cigarette smoke from other rooms creeped into mine at various times. There was a matchbook and ashtray on the side table when I arrived in the room, so I am inclined to think I was given a smoking room? 4. If your room faces the Flamingo, you will hear the constant mechanical whirr of the heating/cooling units on the roof of Bill's. It's actually quite loud and impossible to block out. A useful tip I read here regarding this problem is that closing the bathroom door helps. I can confirm this, although you cannot block out the noise 100%. 5. So not only was I given a smoking room (I guess) when I had booked a non-smoking room, I also was given a handicap-accessible room. I'm not handicapped in any way so I don't understand why this happened. First of all, save the room for those who really need it as I'm sure there were plenty of non-handicapped rooms for me to stay in. Secondly, the presence of all sorts of hand rails and usability accommodations is a big turn off. The toilet was surrounded in a large metal tubed frame that is supposed to help those who cannot stand using their leg muscles and the tub was lined on all sides with the same metal rails. I hate to be complaining about it, but it really was not necessary and Bill's should probably save rooms like this for people who need it. 6. During my morning shower I noticed that I was pretty much standing in a few inches of water as the drain apparently doesn't function as intended. 7. The room door only has a single deadbolt and no supplemental locking device. Additionally, the doors are thin, so you'll hear all the hallway noise. 8. Victoria's Cafe has what I feel is a ridiculous policy of charging $2 + 15% gratuity on takeout orders in addition to NOT serving their specials as take-out. So by now you are probably saying that I'm a hotel snob, and you're right. I am accustomed to staying at 4 or 5 star properties that don't necessarily mean everything is full service, but that there are certain minimum levels of acceptance for how the hotel room is designed and maintained. If I book a non-smoking room, I expect to get a non-smoking room. I also expect that the room be quiet against any mechanical noises present in the building. It also doesn't hurt to not be booked in a handicap-accessible room. That's my 2 cents. Take or it or leave it, but I had to state my observations and I won't ever be returning to Bill's.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location / Stayed Dec. 5th through 7th 2011\u201d", "Author": "Tonysledge", "ReviewID": "UR121538574", "Content": "After reading all the negative reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect.

The room had 2 queen beds, small dining table and 2 dining chairs, writing desk and hard chair, a full size ironing board and iron, wardrobing and hairdryer and by UK standards was very spacious. The bathroom was split into 2 spaces, a washbasin area, with hanging rail, large shelf for cases, ironing equipment and hairdryer - this had no door from the bedroom - a door from here opened into a room with a bath (shower over) and toilet. There was an ice machine and a soda machine within 10 yards of the room. The only missing item for me was a kettle, for early morning tea or coffee. The room service charge for this was exhorbitant, so I walked out to the coffee shop on the casino level to get this. If I make a return visit I will take a kettle for sure. In response to other reviews on here, yes, there is no flashy lobby but a reception desk in the corner of the casino level, but equally there were no long queues waiting to be checked in, such as I saw in all the other hotel lobbies that I visited. Again, the carpet at casino level is grubby, but the housekeeping in the rooms was perfect with crisp clean sheets. The hotel is dark, but it's meant to be that way, dark doesn't equal dirty; the rooms are traditional with dark wooden furniture and regency style wallpaper so if you like a contemporay feel, this hotel is not for you. The bonuses are that you can be in your room from the strip inside of 2 minutes and if you have a car, the parking is equally close. No long haul from either the carpark or the street to your room. Located between Bally's and Flamingo's and directly opposite Ceasars the location is brilliant. If you like pool facilities you have access to the ones at the Flamingo immediately next door.

I'm assuming the fact that Bill's is #38 of tripadvisor's hotels in Las Vegas is because of its location and price - there would be no other reason to stay here. I think for those who only sleep in their rooms, it would be okay. One bed is pretty well like any other at this price point. But we like to chill out in our room, enjoy super-clean bathrooms and housekeeping staff that provide you with fresh towels, extra coffee cups, wipe off bed-side tables, etc. without getting a tip every day. Under those criteria Bill's would, in our opinion, be way down the list. We called ahead of time to ask for one of the coveted rooms on the fourth floor that overlook Bellagio and were told that although they couldn't guarantee that room, the prospects looked good as the hotel was not fully booked. When we got there, of course, there weren't any of those rooms left - even with a $20 tip which the clerk swiftly pocketed, saying she would get us something on the strip, but looking in the other direction. Our room was right above the outside bar at the Flamingo and the \"boom-boom\" of their dance music went on until the early hours. The only way we could drown out the sound was to have the air conditioning on - which sounded like a 737 landing when it kicked in. The linen was worn and shiny polyester, the grout in the bathroom unspeakably discoloured and unattractive, and the mattress lumpy. There was no security at the elevator doors in the evening and an assortment of scary looking men and women crouched in the corner where the internet was trying to get warm. I doubt very much if they were staying or gambling at the hotel. I would not stay here if I was a woman on my own. On Friday and Saturday the casino was constantly patrolled by groups of young men who seemed eager for a fight - they also were not gambling. The only time I noticed security was when a very drunk young woman threw up on one of the slot machines. Perhaps, Big Elvis was entertaining at one time, but he looks very sick and tired and could only stand for a few minutes before he had to sit. He seemed more interested in singing his own Elvis-like songs, instead of actual Elvis tunes. He was also disconnected from the audience, his patter out of sync to what was actually going on. And the bar charged $7 for a small drink during the performance - you could walk down the casino and get the same thing for $2 cheaper. In the evenings one of the worst bands I've ever heard in Vegas, where the standard is normally quite high, unethusiastically sang old \"Heart\" and Pat Benetar tunes. We used to enjoy drinking the cheap margarita's in Bill's but they don't offer them for $1 any more, and the ones they have are now all syrup and no booze at all. On the positive side, the location is in the heart of everything with Caesar's and Bellagio across the street. The free shuttle to the Gold Coast - which has a very reasonable buffet for $7.99 if you sign up for their free player card - is nice for a break from the Strip (and perfect for eavesdropping, as there as some interesting characters using the bus service). The Victorian Room had an okay breakfast. And there is a Discount Ticket office at the front of the hotel.

He was not a happy man- so after trying to contact the customer service manager we found he wouldnt be in for two days. Our friend let us borrow a cooler to keep my insulin cool.went down and asked about the fridge 3 times...each time NO! So the next day we ask about the fridge - still no- also now armed with the info about us not getting the suite and at least having a fridge- still NO! Finally i had to remind them about the ADA rules and regulations-i also reminded her of our check in and that she did not give us the suite we were suposed to have- i also reminded her that she tried to get us to pay 30 $ a nite extra!!! she was so snotty - and rude and def should not be in customer service!!!! Amazingly enough they FOUND a fridge for me...Pathetic! some good- great parking and the room we had was clean and roomy. Ok shower and even a window in the shower.

The hotel is one of the older hotels on the strip, in an unbeatable location. Situated on a crossroads opposite Caesars palace, Belagio and Ballys could not wish for a better spot for sight seeing. Excellent entertainment provided in the form of Big Elvis who is actually very very good. Restaurant on site. Exceptional value hotel and the room was spacious with a flat screen tv. Unfortunately no tea/coffee faciltes so went to the local supermarket and purchased a small kettle. Very happy with the hotel, who provided us with a room facing the Belagio fountains and the fantastic music which we could view from our window. Lots of slots and entertainment downstairs, buses outside the hotel, short distance from the airport transfers. From the hotel you have access to all the fantastic hotels on the strip - you can walk everywhere from here and as you are directly on the strip you can get a taxi or bus up and down the strip for a around $5 a day. We really enjoyed looking round all the amazing hotels. There are a lot to see we made sure we saw them all. You can also take a trip to the Grand Canyon from here also but will be a day trip by air. This is not a cheap holiday by any means, but certainly an experience of a lifetime, there are lots of Buffet meals available which are set prices, try a champagne breakfast and make sure you use discount vouchers which are avaialble everywhere in booklets and at the hotels and airport - these will cover your tips or quite a lot of them. Expect to tip 15 to 20% of your bill the vouchers can be worth 15% of your bill, or a fixed sum per person. You will also find discounts on entertainments and shows etc. LAS Vegas is not as glamorous as you might think, there are lots of people giving out cards advertising 'models' for rent they will give to both women and men, and at night they are a nuisance. There were are also people that are not so well off hanging round most of the popular hotels asking for help, beers etc. which is a sad indicaton of the reasons they are there - to win their fortune. We went for 8 days, saw all the hotels and it was a very interesting experience, we did find it very difficult to find a quiet place to have a drink without a fruit machine in front of you and as we are not gamblers probably wont go again, but having said that glad we went as is an amazing visual experience. We would recommend this hotel due to the location. Entertainment in Las Vegas is comparatively expensive some of the shows in the larger hotels were in excess of $200 per ticket - but some others such as the shows in smaller hotels are free or you may go to a dinner and show in somewhere like the Stratasphere for around $50 per person, we did and thoroughly enjoyed the evening.

I went to reception first thing to ask for a non smoking room, and explained about the smell and our both having asthma. I was told there were no free rooms, which being peak season was quite possible. They said they would get maintenance to see what they could do. I was sceptical, and was fully prepared to come back later in the day, grab my luggage and go elsewhere. I was pleasantly surprised when I got back, what a difference. Nice subtle deodorised smell, all stale smoke smell gone! From there things were fantastic.

The price was much better, and Bill's seemed to be just across the street from Caesar's, as were a few other hotel casinos. When we actually got there we discovered that, thanks to a pedestrian overpass rather than crosswalks, Bill's really is closer to Caesars than any other hotel with the possible exception of the Bellagio which, of course, is not a lower-priced alternative. (It was still a bit of a walk. However, anything in Caesars still involves a lot of walking, so we probably weren't much worse off in that regard than if we had stayed in Caesars.) It's also a central location on the Strip. Check in and check out at Bills were fairly fast, and the hotel lobby is right adjacent to the hotel door, not a long walk as in other Vegas hotels. Taxis dropped us close to the door and were immediately available there again when we left. The casino is noisy and reeks of tobacco smoke, but our room near the far end of the top floor was quiet and odor free. The guest room also seemed a little larger than many hotel rooms we've stayed in. Since the elevator is just inside the side door on Flamingo, it was not necessary to spend much time in the casino area. The room was reasonably clean and comfortable, but there were a few issues. The flapper valve in the toilet leaked, so the toilet would noisily refill periodically. Keeping the bathroom door shut kept down the noise. Also, the tub drained slowly. The most annoying problem was the time housekeeping removed water glasses from our room and did not replace them. It took half an hour after I called the front desk before we again had water glasses in the room. On another day my wife ran into some difficulty in getting housekeeping to take care of our room. Although the room was adequately supplied with most of the usual amenities, it suffered from the conspicuous absence of a coffee pot. Colleagues in Caesars Palace had the same complaint. Apparently they want people to leave their rooms and go to the casino. There is a coffee bar in the casino where $3.00 coffee is available. Another problem of sorts is that one of the two elevators was out of service for most of our stay. However, we got along fine with one elevator and never had a long wait.

We arrived around 10pm on a Thursday night, only to find that our room type and bed type were not available. While I understood that the bed type was not guaranteed, the room type (Deluxe with Partial Strip View) is what we paid for, so I was upset that we were downgraded with no compensation. The desk told me to call at 7am the next morning to switch to a room with two doubles when it became available. I did so, and I was greeted with a very negative attitude. They told me to call back at 10am, so I did. As you can imagine, starting your vacation to Vegas with a major sleep deficit is not pleasant. After being told at 10am that my bed type was not going to become available, I consulted a manager, and magically, I was immediately given the keys to a room with two doubles (it was still downgraded from the deluxe room I prepaid). Didn't receive an apology or any perks. The other customer service issue had to do with check-out. I was notified at 11:15am that I was late checking out, even though the plaque in the bathroom clearly stated that check-out was at 12 noon (they claimed it was 11am, but that info was nowhere to be found). When I requested a late check-out to buy some time, they told me one was not available, which seemed like a complete lie on a Tuesday. I was forced to vacate the premises within minutes to \"avoid additional charges\". Not a fun way to end your Vegas trip. Now for the good. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. It's dead center of the strip, steps away from Flamingo, Ceasars, Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood, City Center, etc. The parking garage is conveniently located close to the hotel. It requires a different elevator, but it makes getting around so easy. The casino was on the smokier side, but that didn't affect me much, as I did most of my gambling elsewhere. The rooms were very basic, but came with comfortable beds, effective air-conditioning, a bathroom that didn't flood/steam up, and sleek flat-screen tv's. The decor is outdated, but reminded me of the old Vegas within the new Vegas, which was very cool. Everything in the room was quite clean.

The rooms, as most people note, are large, clean and tidy. Our room had a great bathroom, really large and looked like it has possibly been recently renovated. There is no doubt Bills is awesome value for its location and the size and the quality of the rooms. Unfotunately for us we didnt have the greatest experience there. Our room was located at the very end so one side of our room had nothing and the other side had a suite. Great, we thought, no one on one side of us. There were people staying in the suite though and they were in Vegas to party (isn't everyone?) Unfortunately though, they wanted to party in their suite. And they literally had a party. The music was pumping, at first it was just guys drinking, then girls came over. The kind of girls that can't speak but have to shriek and woooo all the time. It was so loud, we could every word they were saying, like they were in our room. We understand it's Vegas so we tried to give the benefit of the doubt but after several hours we called the front desk and asked if they could possibly turn the music down. We did hear security come up a little while later and the music was turned down but their loud talking and screaming didn't stop all night. Unfortunately this happened the second night also. While this was nothing really to do with the actual hotel, and they did respond when we asked about turning the music down, it just gave me a negative view overall. I also think that when you go to Vegas, the hotel is part of the experience and I probably wouldn't stay here again.

However I felt a bit bad that she had no pants on so we gave her my husbands shorts and escorted her back to her room which we eventually discovered was next door.

I went immediately down to the front desk and they sent someone to check the lock. They assured me they would fix it in the morning. We stayed another 4 days and we could never get it fixed.

This being my fifth trip to Vegas (having stayed at the Stardust, Aladdin, planet hollywood and MGM previously), I was apprehensive about going to an inexpensive older hotel such as Bill's, but based on the TA reviews and needing to do the trip on a shoestring budget, I was pleasantly surprised. For $29/night for the first 2 nights ($69/night for the Friday night), I couldn't ask for a better deal -- the room was spacious and clean (albeit dark and drab decor -- the quiet A/C more than made up for this), we had a perfect view (I used the $20 trick at check-in and were upgraded to a deluxe room with a clear view of the Bellagio fountains and Eiffel Tower), were centrally located (within steps of the escalators to Bally's or Caesar's, and the Bally's/Paris monorail) and because of the size of the hotel, it was a very quick check in and it wasn't a long trek to get to the Strip from our room. My one grievance about the stay was after having friendly, quick service from our front desk lady and being greeted by the cleaning staff every morning, the bellhop who took our luggage for storing after check-out was so rude, it put a damper on our day. It was a quiet morning at the front desk (read: not busy or crowded) and we were four women in two rooms with 4 carry-on bags and 1 day bag for storage. After reacting with shock and unconcealed irritation when we said we were storing the bags until 7pm, the bellhop rolled his eyes, scoffed, and said, \"I'll store four bags.\" This after allowing a young family ahead of us with multiple carry-on and check-in bags and strollers to store all of their items. He then rolled his eyes some more and glared at us like we were inconveniencing him when we went off to the side to re-pack the fifth bag (while the front desk clerks whispered and laughed at our predicament), gave me the stub and dismissed us condescendingly. I regret not getting his name. It wasn't even the inconvenience of having to re-pack that was the issue, but the confrontational way it was demanded. After having received such friendly service from the other staff, I have to say that this was so out of no where that it ruined the rest of our morning for us and we -- a group who appreciates good service and tips liberally -- were set on not tipping at all upon retrieving our luggage. Having said that, another bellhop named Windell was working when we returned, and was so polite, friendly and gracious that we did tip him (and told him to please only keep the tip for himself as I specifically did not want a cent to go to the other man). He offered to hail us a cab and made up for our bad experience. All in all, the two stars down down is because of that one incident, along with the $12 internet fee, the $5 fee if you ask the front desk to print your boarding passes and some minor noise issues at night (which aren't that bad but would disrupt a light sleeper). Ultimately, the pros far outweigh the cons -- location, view and value can't be beat.

I think it has been described as a 60's porn suite by others. It was also in need of a bit of attention in places. Having said that, it was clean and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Bills is tiny compared to the majority which you can get easily lost in. Ate in the dining room a few times which was also good value. Tried the steakhouse one night and the majority of my party were not impressed. Also it was very expensive and they added an incredible 20% gratuity charge on the bill which we weren't happy paying and only paid 10%. Our family love playing poker but I found the poker at Bills a little boring and we ended up playing at the Harrah a couple of times which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Excellent value, I could find no other hotel in such a great central location that offered such a good price. The rooms are rather dated.... but clean, with smart flatscreen TVs.

With only 4 floors of rooms you can get in and out of the hotel in a couple of minutes.... and out onto the strip - and decide which way you want to walk - north or south!

It is not a glitzy chrome on plastic sort of place but it does have an atmosphere all of it`s own. Where to start ? The room was on the corner and had a brilliant view right across to the Bellagio, watched the Fountains, with Bally`s on the other side, It was very well maintained and the beds were both large and comfortable. Facilities were excellent although we missed the Tea/Coffeee maker. Breakfast was enormous and very, very tasty they do try their best to make you overdose on coffee. For the beer drinkers do not bother with the bar near to reception, go down to the bar at the Strip end, they sell 4 pint jugs at $4:00. The continual Karaoke nearby is an added bonus although a bit wearing. Location could not be faulted with all the Casinos within walking distance.

We stayed in Room 402, which is the corner room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Ballys.

I brought ear plugs just in case, but never had to take them out of the package. The casino had lower stakes gambling, which was nice to find. They regularly had poker tournaments for a $30.00 buy-in. However, due to the limited tables, you have to get there ahead of time. As for the service workers, they were wonderful. The cocktail waitresses learned our names and consistently took care of us -- especially Kim! The dealers in the poker room were nice and fun to sit around with. Many thanks to Matt, Shawn, and Hector! There was only one instance of an older guy behind the bar that was rude. Other than that, we never had an issue with the staff. The only downside we found was the hotel's cafe restaurant. With tax and tip, it cost $50.00 for breakfast! For that kind of money, we could have ate a champagne brunch at Treasure Island and still would have saved $15.00. In my opinion, the only time I would eat here is between 12:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. when they run their breakfast specials! Lastly, do hit the ticket vendors. There is one at the front of Bills.

You get picked up from the hotel, taken to the airport, given a safety overview then on to the choppers. There were four all up and we flew over the Hoover dam as well. We landed on the floor of the Canyon, a little above the Colorado River and had a small meal and glass of chamnpagne, took some amazing photos and then left just before sunset to get the best pictures.

I understood the property was aged and the furnishing were not new. I really looked forward to being able to get out on the strip in a few seconds of leaving the room and not having to traverse a full scale resort to get anywhere. We stayed Memorial Day weekend, so we did not enjoy the cheap rooms everyone talks about here. 3 nights = $550 Once arriving at Bills for our Deluxe room, check in was very quick. The room was large and as expected, the carpeting, bed and other furnishings were dated. The bed was actually lumpy (weird). The drain in the tub/shower was slow and water buildup happened with each shower. Maid service excellent! No safe or refrigerator in the rooms. A/C worked great and kept the room super cool. Here is why I rated Bill's so low: First, Our room faced Tropicana Blvd. Each night and all night long, the emergency vehicles from the nearby firehouse would sound their sirens as the raced up and down the street. Very loud to say the least. Secondly, on one night of our stay during Memorial Day weekend, the fire alarms kept going off again and again, but there was no emergency! I asked what was going on and I was given some bull line about annual testing. So, they selected one of the busiest nights of the year at 4am in the morning to test and re-test their fire alarm system. I think someone who had something against the place was pulling the fire alarm, knowing the place was full and the complaints it would generate. Third, The unionized bartenders at Bill's just do not give a crap about service. Even with good tips, they just acted like you were a bother. One of them actually told me that he did not care what management thinks, because they cannot fire him anyways. I thought, WOW....why is this guy a bartender to begin with if he is so miserable. I had not been to Vegas in many years and the place has changed substantially. When in the casinos, you have to be gambling with more than $10 to get a complimentary drink. If drinks are not complimentary, the regular prices are high! You cannot have more than one drink at a time, even if you are paying. So, you cannot have a shot and a drink at the same time. We tipped, but observed those that did not tip....did not get drinks. The days of cheap food are few and far between. Buffets are expensive (at least the nicer ones are) and even with coupons, it seems to cost much more to eat than what I remember from the past.

Positives- clean, great TV, and good size. Bathroom was a bit tight, but not worth a complaint at any level! For me the noise from the strip was a bit of a hassle- it is pretty loud and goes on all night. This means you can't open a window and this leaves the room a little stuffy despite the aircon. We tried both restaurants and they are both so-so. The more casual 24 hour establishment is OK, but this is Vegas and there are really dozens of nicer places nearby. The steakhouse on the other hand had reasonable steaks and service, but the hostess had dissapeared and the waiting staff were clearly put out by it- never mind the queue that had formed outside- while there were many empty tables inside! We honestly waited 15 minutes and there was no management to complain to. Casino? A bit down at the heel, with barmen who look like they've been there forever, and treat you like you are a bit of a nuisance despite the fact the bar was really very slow when we were there.

It was busy, even at 4.30am when we wandered through past full tables and a queue to get into Drais nightclub. It has a Victorian charm totally unlike the wonderful grandeur of the Bellagio or Wynn's. The only drawbacks I could find were the windows were single-glazed so the sirens and traffic from outside was quite loud on occasions. Their internet was also incredibly slow. For $5 I accessed about three sites in 20 minutes and wouldn't get Hotmail. Apart from that though, there was nothing wrong with the place. There is no pool but you can used the Flamingo's if you're a resident at Bill's and that was fine, despite the pool being freezing at first. We braved that though.

The hotel is pretty easy to find, but if you are coming from I-15 be prepared to wait on Flamingo until there is a break in traffic to get into the parking garage. The front desk woman seemed to hate her job, but we did not let it bug us. The players club workers were wonderful though! Bills is an older hotel, but the room was nicer than rooms I have stayed in at Tropicana, Excalibur, Stratosphere and New York New York for a MUCH cheaper rate! It had a flat screen TV with about 30 channels, dresser, desk, and sitting area. The first night we came back to Bills around midnight and the elevators were stopped on the bottom floor because someone pulled the fire alarm. We were standing around there for a while because no workers would tell us where the stairs were! They kept saying that security would come to take us up. Turns out the stairs are just by the parking entrance and not hard to get to at all. Just know that Hotel Floor #1 is actually Building Floor #5. That's why the hotel elevator takes so long. We gambled the most at Harrahs- that is where we had the most winnings. Bills was nice to gamble in, too. I was worried about the smoke smell in the casino from other reviews, but in comparison to other casinos, Bills is not bad at all! Harrahs buffet was no good though. Dont waste your money. The desserts and seafood were good, but nothing else. It was a little loud outside our room because we were right at the intersection, but we were so tired that we went right to sleep. The A/C helped drown out a lot of the street noise as well. During the evening we heard sirens go by like every 20 minutes! Crazy! We used the pool at the Flamingo on Saturday and it was PACKED! They did not check our hotel key, just our IDs. There were no open chairs and they kept letting people in! I guess they want you to pay the money for a Cabana or lounge when they run out of seats. Luckily we found 2 together and I was able to drag an empty one over so we could be together. THEY DO NOT ALLOW ANY OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINKS, so leave your snacks at the room. People in front of us got their bags searched and had to throw away all their treats. Bring extra money for drinks cause they are expensive. $20 for 5 Coors Light bottles was more than we wanted to pay. I recommend Fat Tuesdays for your frozen drinks. I have tried a bunch on the strip and Fat Tuesday is worth the extra few dollars. Also ask them for a coupon for $1 off your refills! I also recommend Margaritaville for breakfast. We used our 20% off coupons from signing up for the players club and got a really good, generally inexpensive, breakfast! Overall it was a great place to stay! Totally worth the money!

Let me give y'all what I see as the pros and cons. Pros: 1. Great location! You couldn't be in a better place strip-wise! Bally's on one side, the Flamingo on the other, and Caesar's Palace right across the street. It's very easy to walk to most of the desired strip properties from Bill's. 2. I loved being able to get in and out of my room quickly! The casino is small and intimate and easy to navigate. You can literally go up to your room and be back out on the strip in a manner of minutes, a great thing for those shoppers out there. 3. Great deals - the gambling is cheap and the two restaurants are very good. The Victorian Cafe has a great steak and eggs special ($8.99 from 12 midnight to 8 am), and you can get into Bill's Steakhouse for half off if you visit the on-site discount tickets outlet. 4. Great views - best view of the Bellagio Fountains I've ever enjoyed, we were able to see the fountains do their thing time and time again during our trip. The Cons: 1. Street noise - I'd read other reviews about this, but it was actually pretty bad from our room. You could hear every motorcycle and sirens wailed constantly. Needless to say, my sleep was disrupted more than once, at Bill's you sleep in one to two hour modules and hope you can go back to sleep once you're woken up. 2. The bathrooms are really small - Not to the point they're uncomfortable, but if you need a little bathroom space, be advised this isn't the property to stay at. The tubs/shower tend to drain slowly as well. 3. Maybe this was just me, but every late night occupant at Bill's seemed to slam the door to their rooms as they returned. Needless to say, this didn't help one's sleeping a bit. All in all, Bill's is a great value and in a great location. I also happened to by chance run into some Harrah's execs over at Caesar's Palace.

I think the only difference in the room category was the view (of the strip), but it was nice they didn't stick us with two queen beds. Overall, the room was nothing special. It was spacious, and the bed was pretty comfortable. The pillows were pathetic, but what you'd expect for the price. The TV was a nice large flat screen attached to the wall in front of the bed, but the remote wasn't in the best working order. The bathroom was okay. The tub was very slow to drain, and the shower head was pretty low (however, the water pressure was great). Also, the caulking around the tub was discolored and looked moldy but otherwise it was pretty clean. The casino was small but fun. It's more smokey than the major casinos on the strip, but we didn't spend much time there and won at the slots, so I can't complain. We didn't eat at the restaurants, so I can't speak to that. The parking was free and adequate. It seemed pretty safe. Overall the hotel and the room were run down and old. It is adequate, especially if you plan to spend minimal time in the room, but nothing impressive. Also, we had a problem upon checkout, but I'm not sure it was the fault of the hotel. We had booked and paid for our room via a travel website, and when we went to check out the hotel tried to charge us, saying that we had only reserved the room through the booking website.

The street noise was there, but not really a big deal at all. The LCD TV was awesome. The sundry counter had very reasonable prices on everything. My biggest issue with this hotel is the pillows. They are half the size of a normal pillow, and they give you 3 for a king sized bed. I called down and requested more, but they were booked up and didn't have extras. I did not sleep well for 6 nights on those minipillows. The second issue was minor, but it was a constant hassel. They have a bottleneck of people at the front desk/bell desk/victorian room entrance. All 3 of these services conjoins in a 5 sq ft area, so if you need the bell desk or front desk anywhere around meal time, you are screwed. The staff were all very friendly and helpful as much as they could be. No complaints there. I was very surprised to see all the drug dealers in the casino restrooms at 6am though.

We took advantage of Seattle's Best coffee in the morning to get us going for the day. And the 99 cent margaritas were a good way to start off the night. We also liked that we could use our room key to take advantage of the Flamingo pool.

Right across the road is Ballys, where many shuttles depart from, and there is a good little convenience store in the lobby for chips/snacks/drinks etc. Bills does not have anything like that on premises. Casino on premises is fine for average punter. Poker \"room\" is only 3 tables, but is best entry level cash game around, and tournaments are held regularly and generally made up of only 10 or so people. Played a few games there, and also tried Ballys poker area across the road. Drinks were good and waitresses were fine with a nominal $1 tip per drink. There's also a great little hotdog cart next to the poker tables. Don't pick a hotel right in the middle of the action & complain about the noise. Turn the air cond or tv on if outside noise bothers you, or get a room off the strip. Don't whinge about minor conditions of the room or bathroom as Bills is an old building, but price reflects this.

Negatives: bed linens a tad scratchy; only two straight back chairs in our room for seating; 24-hour restaurant is kind of pricey and no to-go service, which makes getting a cup of coffee difficult after 3 PM when separate coffee bar closes; attitude of dealers much sterner after 2 AM.

Here's my suggestions based on our trip - 1. Staying at Bill's let us get away without renting a car. We're within a reasonable walking distance of everything. We could walk to NY-NY in about 20 minutes and on the other side to the Fashion Show Mall in about the same amount of time. 2. Take the Bells Tran shuttle to and from the airport. If you book a round trip it's $12 per person total. We got jobbed by taking a taxi. Seriously, they are all out to rip you off. They purposely took us through the tunnel so that it would take longer. A trip that should have cost about 15-16 bucks, cost us 25. Plus, the back seat was wet and smelled like the drying agent was a cherry air freshener. 3. Save the gambling for the week, or during the day. If you like to play the tables, then all the minimums go up at night. During the day or on the weeknights, you can find a $5 minimum just about anywhere. 4. We upgraded to a Deluxe room at Bill's which was the midgrade. The description said \"Strip partial view\". Our room (124) directly looked at Ballys and Paris and we even got a view of the Bellagio. It was great. I read comments about Bill's being noisey at night, but it wasn't any noiser than any other place. We weren't disturbed at all. Thinking about the comments, I turned on the AC to fan only for the night to drown out the noise. It wasn't necessary, but it helped drown out the occasional ambulance/police siren. 5. Another comment was about Bill's being too smokey. I don't like smoke any more than the next guy, but you have to expect it when you go to Vegas. All of the casinos are smokey. It isn't terrible, but Bill's is right on par. The room is not smokey at all, just the casino area. We didn't eat at Bill's, so I can't speak about the steakhouse. 6. That brings me to my last point. For the money, Bill's can't be beat. We literally slept, showered, and cleaned up, then spent almost our entire day somewhere else. The location is perfect for this. You can walk right across the street and you're at Caesars or Bellagio. Ballys or Paris is right across on the side of Bills. It's the perfect place to stay, especially because there is no resort fee.

Our room was big and we had a comfy king size bed. Our room was towards the back of the hotel and faced Flamingos; it was quiet, with the only noise being a ventilation unit outside. We rarely heard any noise from the Strip. Another benefit of Bill's is its size - because it is a lot smaller than the other hotels on the Strip, there are smaller queues at reception (if any) and it doesn't take 20 minutes to get from your room to the front door! Almost all the staff at Bill's are really friendly too (although we did find this across the whole of Vegas). The hotel itself doesn't have the plush and swish style of some other Vegas hotels, but it does have some charm. It's old, but not shabby, and our room was spotlessly clean. Bill's location is great too. Across the road from Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio, the hotel is just about central on the Strip. We ate at the Victorian Cafe in the hotel and although we weren't exactly adventurous in our choices (2 burgers please! It was late and we'd just been travelling for 15 hours!), the food was good and served quickly too.

She refused to try and listen to me. 2) While I was there it was 106 throughout my stay give or take a little. When I went out in the morning I would leave on the AC on. When I came back the maid always had shut it off. It took about five hours to recool down my room. I get why they shut it off, but if they are going to do so they need to get better AC units. 3) It was a very far walk from the elevators to my room. Once in my room I had to walk back down to the elevators to get ice then back to the room. As I said before it was about 106 so ice was definitely needed. This isn\u2019t that big a deal, but I have a bad hip and knee which made this really awkward, especially after all that I walked throughout the day. It was my fault though since I forgot to ask if they had handicapped rooms available. 4) On my last day (the 7th day) I grabbed all of my shopping bags from my rental to take up to my room to box and ship home UPS. For the first time the entire trip a guard was at the elevator doors, which made me have to put down everything I was carrying to show my room card. This was a hassle with my bad hip and knee (bending over isn\u2019t that easy) just to flash a card. What makes no sense is why be so worried now that someone is going to sneak up to the rooms when they have been unguarded for a week already. Also the fact that anyone that kept their one-time room card/ or could find-get one could still sneak up there.

We stayed in the hotel for 7 nights in a room overlooking the Flamingo so no traffic noise and a great nights sleep. Bill's more than met our expectations in terms of cleanliness, room size, restaurant and casino however the security and access to the rooms could be greatly improved. The huge negative for us was that our room was broken into on our last day. It took us a while to realise that someone had been in the room as it had been cleaned by housekeeping but when we arrived back there were a few things out of place. My husband then discovered his watch was missing and I could see that someone had been through my handbag as all the zips were open and a few things were spilling out. We are seasoned travelers so we had all our other valuables with us (iPad, iPhone, Camera, rings) and our passports were in a travel safe we had with us. We went down to report the incident to reception who called security and came up to the room with us to look things over but it was obvious that they didn't believe us. The guard even called up to the room later to ask if we had found the watch! There was no damage to the door so it has to be someone with a master key card. We discovered the following day that noise reduction headphones had also been taken. We were given an incident number and asked to call the Risk Management team 3 working days later. Its been tricky to call with the time difference but I have tried and always reached an answering machine. Today we received a letter stating that the information has been reviewed and that Bill's provided reasonable care in its duty to provide a safe, secure, and fun gaming environment for its customers. Our complaint was not to do with the casino but to do with the rooms upstairs. If there was more security to get to the rooms and a couple of camera's in the corridors it would be easy to see who entered our room. I have responded to the letter and included a copy of this report in my response. The items stolen total about \u00a3200 therefore we are not making a claim on our insurance so we weren't looking to recoup our losses in the casino! To conclude the hotel rooms and amenities were good but until I am assured that the security has been improved and that there are safes in each room I wont be returning or recommending my friends to stay.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aarhus, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cFun atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "ekawq", "ReviewID": "UR85610042", "Content": "The whole \u2018hall & saloon\u2019-theme was fun \u2013 location perfect in middle of the Strip.. no amenities in room (=no coffee machine; no refrigerator; WI-FI relatively expensive) but that might be room/rate specific..

En-suite bathroom with bath and shower over top. perfect size!! Air conditioning kept the room lovely and cool, was still in the 40's when we were there! Air con can be a bit noisy at night but not enough to keep us awake all night. Hardly any street noise!! Casino is a lot smaller than some others along the strip but still has everything you could want.

If you are reading this in the first place, odds are you're not a high roller looking for a 5-star world-class hotel. That being said, Bill's simply CANNOT be beat for the value. I challenge you to go ask one of your friends tomorrow who have been to Vegas and ask them what they thought about Bill's. I know what they'll answer.....\"About which place???\" But don't let that fool you. See specifics below. Location: Location is 75% of the draw of any Hotel in Vegas. If you don't believe me, just read the reviews on the Stratosphere. Bill's is on one of the hottest corner's in Vegas. Situated across the street from Caesar's, The Flamingo, and Bally's (also caddy-corner to the Bellagio). Bill's places you in the heart of the strip. It is within WALKING DISTANCE OF EVERYTHING. The only time I took a mode of transportation other than my feet, was getting to and from the airport. One of the biggest bonus for me is what I call the \"room to strip time\". (No, it's nothing sexual). From the time it takes you to leave your room and be out on the strip took me an average of 1 min and 50 seconds. Compare this to 90% of other resorts and you'll find that it is AT LEAST A 10 MINUTE WALK from your room just to get out to the street. And that gets real old, real quick. Food: The food was decent at the Victorian Room. They have good specials and the wait is usually minimal. But a 3 minute walk away from the hotel will take you too Ellis Island. For $7.95 all day you'll get a great steak, 2 sides, bread, and a tall beer of your choice. Room: Awesome. Very spacious, separate sitting area, great view of the strip, computer desk, several mirrors, big plasma T.V., spacious bathroom, and separate toilet/shower for privacy (so one person can get ready while the other person is still nursing last night's hangover). I will say this however. MANY of the older casinos still have a slight musty smell when you first walk in. This was in no way enough to bother me at all. But there are those people would could be sensitive to this. That being said, the room was VERY clean, and the staff was always seconds away from assisting us if we needed anything. Casino: Depends what you're looking for. If you want a laid back place with friendly dealers who give you advice, this is your place. It is busy during the busy times and slow during the off times. That being said, I never had a hard time finding a table, even at the craps table! Bill;s even has a great poker area. They have .50/1.00 no limit games which are very friendly and most of the players are average at best. They also offer $30 buy-in tournaments several times a day - a VERY REASONABLE buy-in. Great dealers and manager Chris are friendly, professional, and very helpful. I met some very cool people in the casino, and most of them ironically, were from other nearby hotels! Sign up for a players club, for free money entries, comps and more. It only takes a second. Nightclub/Karaoke: I didn't sit in the karaoke area but there were a lot of people having fun. On to Drai's Afterhours. Bottom line, if you're still looking for a place to hang out when everything else shuts down, then Drai's is your place. Especially if you like house music. MUSIC is key. Most places place a mix of hip-hop and top 40. Personally, I can listen to this at home or in my car if I want. To me a the heart and soul of a club is the music and sound. And Drai's has it. I went to XS one night at the Wynn and it was nothing short of amazing, but the whole time I was still looking forward to Drai's when it shut down. It doesn't get busy until around 4:30, so do something else in the meantime. A variety of rooms to choose from, authentic decor, intimate feel, expensive (but strong) drinks, great vibe, good-looking girls, and great music make this a perfect spot to end (or start) the day! Miscellaneous: Bill's doesn't have a pool, but a 4 minute walk takes you to the beautiful grounds of the Flamingo, where you can use that pool for free. DO NOT LET THIS BE A DEAL BREAKER. It's really not that big of a deal. Overall: I have been to resorts and casinos all over the world. When I was in Vegas, I also made it a mission to walk in every hotel on the main strip. Keep in mind, when you're in Vegas, your hotel is typically just a place to lay our head at night. Walk into a place like the Wynn, Venetian, Caesar's, etc and you'll be stunned. But beyond visually impressed, it's not worth the extra 150 a night. I stayed a Bills with a friend for 5 nights. The total came to $295 ( 142 p/person). If I stayed at the Venetian, I would have payed around $900. You know what that equates to?.....MORE GAMBLING MONEY. Remember, it's free to walk into any hotel and casino. You are essentially paying the difference for which ceiling you stare at before you shut your eyes. That being said, Bill's does have a lot to offer, just not in the form of luxury. But again, if you're reading this, that's not what you're after anyways. You're looking for the best deal in the closest spot. And if that's the case.

I spent about 3 and a half hours playing blackjack with my wife and a guy from montana and having a great time. We lost all of the money we started with but it was a good time. After the first session we came back at least twice a day for single deck 5 dollar blackjack which is a rarity in most vegas casinos on the strip.

I would suggest that you check for promo codes for Bill's and also check your reservation online a few times before you go, because I ended up getting the room cheaper just by re-checking my reservation, I called the hotel and got an adjustment very easily. One of the things I like best about this hotel is the size. It is so small compared to other hotels on the strip. And that means that check-in is seemless and no wait, the elevator is steps away from the front desk. Everything is easy to find and compact. You don't have to walk a mile from the entrance to the hotel elevators or anther mile to the parking garage. Bill's is also a very small casino compared to its neighbors and is always busy. The room is very clean, nice flat screen TV mounted on the wall and a fairly comfortable bed. Not the best but not the worst. Really, for the price we paid, anything would have been fine!

Wow...I've never been asked before to pay extra for the room type that I reserved. If I really wanted a view of the fountains, I would have stayed at the Bellagio. I stayed at Bill's because it's cheap. Since I was alone, I just took a room with 2 double beds and didn't pay extra. The room was pretty beat up and old, but clean for the most part.

This trip I was going by myself for a UNLV seminar and decided to stay at Bill's asI have enjoyed gambling there in the past and enjoying the entertainment. Bill's was absolutely a fine place to stay for the price and what I needed. I arrived at 11:30 AM, not a good time to check in I know. I was the first and only person in line (I later walked through the line at Flamingo which was comparable to DisneyWorld). I was greeted in a very friendly fashion by the lady at the front desk and told the king room I had reserved was not available until 3:00 (that's more than fair) but a two queen room was available right then. I was offered to upgrade to a bellagio/strip view room but passed as I knew that my be noisy. I just asked for a quiet room. The lady at the front desk really was great - I received a room on the top floor (415) that still had a great view of the strip looking north and was very quiet! The room was good size with a 42\" flat screen. TV remote was missing battery cover and they fell out a couple times, but no big deal. I'm not a picky traveler, but the room appeared very clean to me with a nice big window. Temperature was a bit warm when I arrived by easily was adjusted and cooled quickly. Bed was comfortable. The toilet and shower are in a seperate room, both were very clean but I didn't get on hands and knees to inspect. The sink is in a seperate room with clothes rack in there. A different set up, but not a bother at all. The decor was older style with dark brown colors, not the latest in interior design but fine for a place to stay. I was reminded right away by the front desk I had access to the Flamingo Pool, but didn't use it. I had breakfast at Bill's a couple times, nothing spectacular but a decent value on the strip. The bar has decent specials and has \"Fat Elvis\" on the weekday afternoons and karaoke at night early in the week, lounge bands later in the week. Gaming - just simply an excellent experience. From the moment I sat down, all the dealers and pit bosses were very friendly. First dealer I played with told me I should sign up for a players club card as they give away $100 in comps six times a day if you sign up for a card and sign up for the promotion. Sure enough, I won $100 in comps one day! You can use at Bill's with a swipe of your card or go to the Players Club and can print out a voucher for any restaurant at a Harrah's property. Great deal! Location - spectacular. Quick walk to Caesars, Bellagio, Flamingo, O'Sheas, Imperial Palace and Casino Royale which all offer either from classy to budget gambling/dining. I checked out very early (4 AM) and the front desk was right there and friendly as ever, even at the early hour. Took about two minutes. My overall experience at Bill's was very pleasant and I was glad I took the chance to check it out as I will definitely consider it as a low cost, great location option on my next trip to Vegas.

Its small size also means no lines to check in our out, which made a refreshing change. But the rooms are noisy. If you're on the Flamingo hotel side, there's the constant and suprisingly loud hum from their airconditioners, and the rooms on the other side, being close to the Strip/Flamingo intersection, get very loud traffic noise day and night. You'll need earplugs to sleep, and even then you'll be woken by not infrequent sirens. I also found my bed uncomfortable. I may have been unlucky, as several other reviewers have said how comfy they found them, but I had to change room once as the first bed was so lumpy and soft I could never have slept in it. And the second was only a little better. To summarize, if budget and location are key issues for you, then Bill's is fine.

I can honestly say that I had expected the hotel would have some flaws, but nothing that would generate a negative review: Check-In: Due to the hotel's size, the wait times are usually minimal. During my 5 days, I did not see more than 5 people in line. Our room was not ready (we had arrived at 12pm), but within a few minutes of going to our friends room, it was ready. Check-out can be done through your TV. Room: A fairly sized room, with a good king bed, flat panel TV, small bathroom and great view (Room 316). The closet is in the powder room, with the toiler/shower in a separate room. Like the previous review, our shower had a minor drainage problem. Our remote did not work either, and within 10 minutes, problem solved. Bed was comfortable, with 3 pillows (Not average size though for a king bed) and we had new ones brought to us the next day. Oh also, this is a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, Bally's and Paris. Casino: Small, and a bit smoky, but what can you expect for a 31 year old hotel, that Harrah's had planned on tearing down? About as low of a limit as you can find without going downtown, or off-strip, lots of penny slots, and $5 blackjack. Sign up for a Bill's card. Comps are used throughout all Harrah's resorts, and ensure you enter your name into the Comp Explosion draw for $100 of comps (My girlfriend and I had both won and used them). Dining: Victorian Room offers good quality food at a hard to beat price. $14.99 for prime rib all day, All You Can Eat Chinese food at 9.99 (Limit to one specific dish) and lots of other specials. Sebrina was an amazing server, super friendly and funny. Did not eat at the Steakhouse, since it was closed 2 nights, but I heard good things from the people i talked to. Did not like Seattle's Best Coffee, but their cold drinks were top notch. Clientel: Nearly everyone and their next door neighbour. A good mix of young people and older people. You would see some young 20 somethings for a birthday, and a seniors trips at the same craps table. This place also has a Tix4Tonight location, and a few people trying to hock timeshares. You are within spitting distance from Flamingo, Bally's and just a few short steps from Bellagio, Caesar's and Paris. You can use the pool at Flamingo, which is one of the better ones. In final, this hotel is ALL about location vs price. You cannot beat the deal you will get here. Keep that in mind, and you will have a great time.

And at $89 for the night of July 4 (i.e. one of the busiest of the year). no-one could possibly complain about the price. Negatives: facilities misrepresented on hotwire.com, through which I booked (the site said the hotel had free wi-fi, whereas in fact it costs $10 a night on top of the room rate) and a blocked drain in the bath/shower. We called Room Service and an engineer came, cleaned out the plughole assembly and told us it was all fixed. It wasn't: when we tried the shower again the water was up to ankle length in the tub within a couple of minutes. It being the night of July 4 there was only one guy on duty for the whole hotel and he couldn't do any more. The very smoky atmosphere in the casino/lobby (you have to walk through it to get to and from the elevators) wasn't nice, either.

My boyfriend and I stayed at Bill's all three nights and we were very glad that we did. Last year we stayed at Planet Hollywood, which is an excellent hotel don't get me wrong, however I always found to get from your room to the strip or the other way around, it took way too long. This year we decided to give Bill's a whirl and it was great! First off, it's right smack dab in the middle of the Strip. It neighbours Bally's, and the Flamingo and is very close to Paris and Planet Hollywood. It's right across from Ceasar's Palace and the Bellagio... Seriously it doesn't get much better than that for the price you're going to pay. Our room was a South facing view, so we got a bit of Bally's but we could see the Strip and the Bellagio fountains as well. Bill's is very small for a Vegas Strip hotel, which is really awesome because it doesn't take you long to get anywhere and check-in/out was a breeze. We didn't have to wait one second in line. The rooms were everything you'd expect. The decor is certainly dated, it wouldn't be my first choice but seriously if you care about things like that then you and I probably wouldn't get along. The bed was nice and comfy, the lighting was good and the bathroom did it's job. The bathroom is split into two, with the shower/bath and toilet having it's own door, so if someone's using that, others would be able to do their make up, use the sink, etc. We had no issues with water temperature or pressure, it was very good. We had a flat screen TV with about 30 basic channels and there were other on demand movie channels you could pay for if you wanted. For those who are interested in knowing, there is an internet hookup but you do have to pay extra for it. We didn't use it because we didn't have a computer. We didn't really have any issues with noise, although if someone knocked on your neighbours door it kind of sounded like they were knocking on yours. But really nothing bothered us at all. We didn't really have any noise from the Strip but mind you it was a South facing window and not directly over the strip. Cleaning service was good. Our second day we came back from shopping and everything was spic and span. Our third day (after the wedding we attended) we were very hungover and lazy, so we pretty much spent the entire day eating pizza in bed with the Do Not Disturb sign on the door... and they kept our wishes and did not disturb :) As a Bill's guest you can use the Flamingo pool for free. It's very easy to get to you just hang a right out of Bill's and head into the Flamingo and follow the signs for the pool. To be honest they didn't even check my room key... I could have been anyone, from any hotel. The pool was very packed and has a real party vibe but mind you it was a Saturday at 1pm. I'm sure during the week it's a little easier to find seating. We ate at the Victorian Room once for breakfast and it was good. I would have liked to try some other meals there but didn't get a chance to. We're not huge gamblers but I did some slot and video poker playing. It was pretty fun and there's a good selection of machines. The drink service if you're gambling is very good. I've been to bigger hotels where they won't really care about you if you're playing penny slots, but they do here :) If you're not gambling, drinks are cheap at the bar. Dollar margaritas, and you can get bottles of beer for $2. I was drinking half pints of Dos Equis and it was $1.50 each.... Pretty awesome! If you can, check out Big Elvis who sings there Mon-Fri at 3, 5 and 6:30 I think... something like that anyway. It's always packed to see him though so grab a seat early. Anyway all in all we were very happy with Bill's Gamblin' Hall. It's exactly our type of place... we're not very swanky. We just want a cheap, clean place to rest our heads. This is the BEST place to do it because not only is it cheap and clean, it's the best location you could get on the strip. We really want to get a friends' vacation going next year and this is definitely the place I'd recommend because all of our friends are young and broke, haha. Better to spend your money on more important things like dollar margaritas!

We stayed five nights, Sun-Thur, March 28th - Apr 2, 2010, and were satisfied with the value we got for our dollar. Easy access to the strip in either direction was a huge plus, as we had opted not to get a car for this trip. Pedestrian walkway over LVB to Caesars and more importantly Serendipity 3 was quite helpful. We arrived late enough that they had all but figured we were no-shows, and as such there was no choosing of a room - we got what they had. That meant it faced The Flamingo, rather than facing Flamingo Blvd, and that may have been a good thing. No view of the Bellagio fountains, but also no traffic noise to speak of. Occasional strains of music from Margaritaville and from the CP sign we could hear, but it wasn't awful by any means. The beds were too firm for my liking, but comfortable enough, and there's a plenty-big flat panel TV. The bathroom was infinitesimally tiny, but got the job done. Would I stay there again? Heck yes. Just not for as long as we did, and not on a vacation where I wanted to feel pampered. We were there for value as part of a last minute spring break jaunt.

First room fine, but the furniture hard back chairs didnt make it comfy. Rooms bit dark due to small windows with decorative bars over them. Biggest dissapointment was the suite.

Raised whirlpool was right next to living area. which i liked! It is vegas. But the room was shabby; chipped formica, wall paper peeling, old CRT TV on a rotating plinth so you can watch tv in bed or on the large sofa. One concern was the double doors didn't close or lock very well - moving a good 3-4 inches - a good kick would have opened them. The 1980s decor grey, black and red was dated and very Miami Vice. Whirlpool huge, filled fast (switch to operate is on the wall though!) but the lining was shot, again chipped with holes in it. Returning from a day out, to find a cigar butt in the middle of the floor in the room was a bit of a concern.

We had previously stayed at Bally's which was fine, but, being alone, I wanted something different with shorter hallways. Bill's was the perfect choice for me. On the plus side, of course, is the location. It is right at the main four corners of the strip. You can hop from one casino to another, as so many casinos are within an easy walk. You are located in the heart of the Vegas street life, with outdoor bars and music and people watching. it is a very safe location. If you play limit 2-4 Texas Holdem poker, you are right next door to the Flamingo , which is the best place for this game. Bill's is about 10 yards to get to the Flamingo poker room. closer than if you stayed at the Flamingo. That is where I spent most of my time, but with less commotion. (see next paragraph.) Bill's is uncomplicated. There is little to no wait for check in, little to no wait for an elevator which is right near the registration desk, and easy access to your room at all times of the day or night. The hotel has only four floor of rooms, and it is a short walk to your room. Bill's is fun. The free Elvis show and the karaoke time after the show is so much fun. People sit and have a drink or get up and dance or move around on the carpet. Bill's is friendly. You can sit on a chair at the show and talk to other guests and feel as if you have known them forever. The casino is hopping with folks having fun and it is well known for its atmosphere. The rooms at Bill's are very spacious, 400 square feet, and well appointed. Nothing too fancy but certainly attractive, with flat screen TVs and comfort. The only negative would be that there is no comfy chair in the room, so you have to watch TV on the bed. There is both a desk and a table and chairs in the room. The bathroom has a nice touch with a stain glass window. The restaurant, Victoria's, is charming with stain glass windows and the rich dark wood,,with good food, priced slightly below other strip restaurants for meals.There is also an expensive steak house and a Starbucks on premises. There was not a line to get seated. The casino also has the Victorian theme with the rich dark woods and the gorgeous Victorian chandeliers. I loved the charm, and I prefer it absolutely to the more modern and huge casinos, Bill's is good value. The rooms were affordable and you can ask for the AAA discount of 10%. My only negative was that I couldn't find a cab lined up when I wanted to go to the airport, so I rolled my small suitcase over to the Flamingo. I am sure that the front desk would have called one for me, had I alerted them, but I didn't think of it at the time, but there are generally a couple cabs that are in front of the hotel entrance. ( Cab was $13 plus tip) I highly recommend Bill's for an easy, uncomplicated experience. If you want the glitz and commotion of a bigger place, you might be disappointed, but if you want good value with Victorian charm , nice rooms, and a short walk to many casinos, you will be pleased.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookfield, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat location...Bad customer service\u201d", "Author": "zephed64", "ReviewID": "UR61986987", "Content": "Based on the reviews on this site and the perfect location in the middle of the strip, I booked 4 nights.

It was nowhere near as fancy as most hotels on the trip. Think cheap eats and drinks in a slightly shabby English Pub-type setting. I didn't have good luck with the slots, but I just piddle around, I'm not a serious gambler. Our room wasn't fancy but was comfortable. The only thing I'd change is a taller showerhead. I'm 5'11 and I had to bend all around to get under the thing. We went from March 29-April 2 and got a really good rate coupled with an Allegiant air flight. The hotel was running a prime rib dinner special for $14.99 at the Victorian, which aside from occasional specials was overpriced. The prime rib was wonderful and HUGE, it had to be at least 16 oz. They under-cooked it a bit so we had to send it back, so be mindful of that. When it came back, it was perfect. The other special was from midnight to 6am and was a\"Ribeye\" and eggs (with hash browns and toast) for $5.99. Ribeye was a bit of a stretch, think more like a breakfast sirloin. But after a few drinks, what does it matter? And the drinks, there were 99 cent margaritas, as well as 99 cent Newcastle beer (that they ran out of one night.) Now keep in mind, the margaritas came in the small clear plastic glasses so they weren't huge, but they were pretty potent. The red flavor was very sweet, we preferred the lime margaritas. Basically, they were a little cup of slushie mix with alcohol mixed in. Not very fancy, but addictive. The location of this hotel is wonderful, it's pretty much in the middle of the strip, with the Flamingo on one side and a street and Bally's on the other. One downfall: this hotel doesn't have a pool and it is free to use the Flamingo's, you show them your room key. The hotel staff was neutral. They weren't overly friendly, but they were sufficient. The room was very comfortable, and it should be noted we were on the \"quiet\" side of the hotel, the north side. So we had no view to speak of (unless you consider the side of the Flamingo as scenery) but we didn't hear the foot traffic. The air conditioner was pretty loud, but we like white noise.

I recently attended a convention in Las Vegas and stayed a couple of extra days after the meetings. Upon recommendation from fellow colleagues I booked into Bill's Gamblin Hall and Saloon. The rates varied per night - from a high of $100 to a low of $40. Took a cab from the airport here - it is a shame the monorail is blocked from being extended to the airport and it is doing so poorly that it will likely be in chapter 11. The cab cost $20 - and the airport is essentially in-town! A place like this should have decent mass transit! The nice thing about this property: it doesn't have 4-digit number of rooms like a city until itself. Just a simple couple of person check-in area and four or five floors. This is what I remember a lot of Las Vegas being like decades ago ... Check-in was quick and efficient. The only complaint I had was the room on the street side (Flamingo) of the hotel. The first night I found the noise was a bit much: the traffic plus people and the audio from Lake Vegas a half a block down the strip (fountain music show). I would suggest asking for a room on the back side of the hotel or further from the main intersection. Rooms are fairly basic but clean. There was a large (42-inch?) plasma TV on the wall albeit it was fed with analog signals (and stretched to fit the HD format screen). They should think about upgrading their in-house cable system to provide digital and HD content. There is no safe in the room and no closet; your clothes hang in an area near the sink (which was fine). The amenities were nice but nothing out of the ordinary. Then again - what do you expect for the price? You can't beat the location. As far as I'm concerned - this is pretty much centrally located on the strip. And we walked up past Wynn and equally as far in the other direction. You can also get to a monorail stop in a minute or two from Bill's (we met people at the Flamingo hotel monorail stop). Bills has a tickets for less booth inside the casino (on the corner) - there are a number of these throughout the city / strip. We were able to get half-price tickets for the Blue Man Group. Much better than the $143 \"list\" price! The hotel also has FREE parking. Amazing - considering what you pay for hotel parking in a lot of other big cities. For the last day of our stay I rented a car on-line and picked it up at a nearby hotel. This worked out well as I kept the car, didn't pay anything for parking and dropped it off at the airport - saving a return cab fair. The only thing that wasn't free at Bills was the Internet access. But it seems like most of the hotels charge you - in this day and age I have just come to expect that some kind of free Internet access is available and usually only stay in hotels that provide such. Bills does have both wired and WiFi access. Through a menu choice on the TV you can get your access code (which also causes billing to your room). Didn\u2019t eat whilst at Bills - but did have drinks in the casino, or saloon. Drink prices were quite reasonable - I was surprised. Can't say anything about the gambling as we didn't blow any money here or anywhere else. I'm sure there are other hotels in Vegas where you can get rates like $40. If I found one - I would probably consider it (as long as it was one of the major properties). But otherwise, I'll definitely stay at Bill's again and same some $$$.

These folks obviously didnt know they were going to LAS VEGAS!. Lets face it. Vegas is not a \"family\" vacation. Its an adult vacation. If you are looking for a great place to stay, that is affordable, in a great location, access to everything on the strip, cheap gambling, 99 cent newcastles, 99 cent margaritas, friendly/helpful staff, no lines for check in, easy access to your room without having to take 20-30 minutes to go from casino to room, and a whole lot of fun...the Bills is the place for you. Just returned from a Vegas New Years (which was awesome), and enjoyed every minute at Bills. We spent 5 minutes in check in...5 minutes! We were in our room and then back down to the bar in less time it took to check in. This will not happen at the larger, more expensive, less personal hotels. Had a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio. At night time the views were even more spectacular. But we didnt come for views, we came for action. And Bills puts you right in the heart of the action. Walk out (and on your way stop by and pick up a few margaritas and newcastles for your adventure) Caesar's Palace is right across the street, Ballys and Paris is to the left, Bellagio across the street, Flamingo, Harrahs right next door to the right, 15min walk to the Wynn, 10 minute walk to the Venetian, 7 minute walk to the Mirage...what else could you ask for. Do yourself a favor. Save your money for the shows, nightlife and of course some gambling...stay at Bills Gambling Hall and Saloon.

We don't think so. My two teenagers and I spent our first night, during New Years week, in a room facing the Flamingo Hotel. For some reason, there is free wireless access on that side of the hotel, but not on the other side. We upgraded the remainder of the stay to a strip view. Add a $20 upgrade fee, $20 for a second child in the room, and $12 internet fee per day, and the hotel rivals nearby hotels in price. You need to expect noise. With only four floors, the noise from pedestrians and traffic is close by. There is also noise from nearby bathrooms, and the air conditioner is intermittent and loud. The hotel also offers a free wake up call at 8:45 AM each morning as the cleaning staff knocks on every door announcing themselves. Apparently they do not know which rooms are in use, and have to knock on every one. The hotel is clean, but older. The clientele is older. Everyone smokes. The elevators should have a cancer warning label. While the view of the Bellagio fountains is dramatic, it is partially blocked by a huge television screen with a billboard of a dancer's butt located in front of Bally's Casino. The check in staff, restaurant staff and bell staff are all very good. We made quick friends with Mike, the Bell Captain, and he helped us several times during the week. While the food in the Victorian Room is very good, the restaurant is expensive and seems to have a permanent 20-45 minute wait. $5.00 for a bagel and butter? There is a Tix4Tonight outlet in the casino, which advertises show tickets for \"up to 50% off.\" The truth is that most shows are overpriced to begin with, then marked down an average of 20%, and an undisclosed $5 per ticket fee, plus a hotel fee of up to $25 is added to the cost.

We looked at the highly priced options (my partner really wanted to stay at The Venetian, but we couldn't get a good deal for the time we were visiting). Then we started looking at the highly rated options, and Bill's came to the top, time and time again. We checked the prices and couldn't believe how low the cost would be for a hotel located in the centre of the Vegas Strip, opposite Caesar's, Bellagio, Bally's and The Paris. It seemed too good to be true, but we couldn't resist. Bill's did not disappoint. Obviously Bill's does not have the grandeur of Bellagio's lobby, the amazing shows of Caesar's or the magnificence of Paris' ornate buildings, charming Parisien streets and the half size replica of the Eiffel Tower. However, Bill's is only a few steps away from all of this - you can have it all. Our room was a double queen sized and we upgraded at check in to get a Strip view - which was the best $20 a night we could have spent. We overlooked Bellagio's fountains and it was a delight everytime they danced to a variety of different musical styles. We also had a great view of the Eiffel Tower from our room. The room was clean, and regularly serviced. For those who need it, the 40\" plus sized TV is hung on the wall with all the tv and pay per view you need (we didn't switch it on at all - the Eiffel Tower and fountains were enough for us). Bill's is famous for their Steakhouse restaurant (they even have a $5.99 Steak & Eggs deal from midnight to 8am ... we never got the chance to try it out, but we spoke to several people who had been to the Steakhouse and loved it (these people came from some of the big hotels on the Strip). We did eat in the Victorian Restaurant, which is very popular - basic quick meals and a Chinese menu on top of that. We enjoyed our food before strolling over to Caesar's to see Cher in concert. No need for a taxi. There is a coffee bar (Seattle's Best) open long hours - I managed to get my much needed java before our early start for The Grand Canyon - at 5:30am! Drai's after hours lounge was highly recommended to us by our Red Rock Canyon tour guide as being one of the best in the city (we didn't have the stamina to try it out though). Caught one of the Big Elvis shows (a 300 pound Elvis impersonator) - he was awesome! Later the same day we heard a guest belting out a Phantom Of The Opera song in the Karaoke bar - he was amazing and it was hard to believe he wasn't professional - the atmosphere there was electric and good fun was had by all. In summary - as you have probably gathered - I am a big fan of Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon. If you need a swimming pool and/or fitness centre you have to walk to the neighbouring Flamingo hotel. I have stayed at some of the finest hotels around the world, and yet me and my fellow travellers agreed we would stay at Bill's on our next Vegas visit. By the way, for those of you who wrote about poor service at Bill's I don't know where you got that from - everyone was so welcoming and friendly. It can be quite noisy at night (lots of sirens and car horns all through the night) so if you are a light sleeper you will need earplugs. If you want a great location and a great deal I would definitely recommend Bill's.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cChoose Bill's if you're on a budget!!\u201d", "Author": "CaliforniaMy2cents", "ReviewID": "UR50367523", "Content": "I stayed here from 11/26-11/29. Here's the deal: If you can afford to stay at the Bellagio or Caesar's...do it. Both are perfectly centered on the strip and absolutely beautiful inside! However, if you are like me and can't afford a room for $250+ a night, definitely choose Bill's. It's not beautiful, but it's really chill with an old Vegas kind of charm. And of course, it's an amazing/excellent location. I had a room with a partial strip view which was the top of the Eiffel tower, some of the fountains and some of the strip- very cool! And we didn't have ANY street noise (room 138) and they didn't charge us extra for this room. Big king bed, very roomy, nice little vanity I claimed for myself and a huge flat screen TV. I would MUCH rather choose to stay at Bill's than the Flamingo, Harrah's or Imperial...their prices/location are equivalent but they are SOOO tacky! I mean, basically just ugly and lame. There's not much going on inside and they seem old and weird. Similar to Excalibur, Circus Circus, etc. They are all just tacky and cheap. There's a difference between \"inexpensive\" and \"cheap\". Bill's is inexpensive. Plus, at least with Bill's it's got a nifty charm, you can get to your room in a snap, location is brilliant and Big Elvis headlines during the week. A few cons: 1. we couldn't get the temperature too warm, had to keep fiddling with the thermostat. 2. no real quilt on the bed...bring your own and you'll be fine. (although, you can probably ask for a thicker blanket) 3. water in the shower tends to not go down the drain very well BUT the water pressure and cool window in shower totally make up for it!

Rooms are large, comfy bed, clean, iron & ironing board - everything you need. Only downside was that there were roadworks right outside our room so it was noisy. However, earplugs sorted that out! And then exhaustion sorted it out the rest of the trip! We didn't do much gambling at Bills but it's worth joining the players club as we still got a free t-shirt & $16 off our hotel bill.

We waited 10 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check us in. We went up to our room on the 2nd floor to find we had been allocated a room with 2 queen beds - not the one king bed that we had booked. Surprisingly it was quiet! The beds were old and fell down on the edges meaning you could only sleep in the middle - but the middle also sunk down - not comfortable at all, but the least of our worries. The room had a massive TV, old worn out decor, a strange bathroom/closet, and a small window with a grille on it. The carpet clearly had not been cleaned in years, and my socks ended up extremely dirty from just walking on it. The 'non-smoking' room was clearly a smoking room, as it stunk of stale cigarette smoke, and had a general old musty smell. In the morning we tried to shower, but instead of having a shower ended up being immersed in a bath half full of water. Clearly the bath did not drain. We complained about it at reception and were told it was unusual and assured they would get the engineer to have a look. The next morning when we went to have a shower, guess what? The bath fails to drain again and ends up filled with water. Again we went down to reception and complained, and were told that the maintenance log showed that the an attendant had been to our room and 'fixed' the draining issued. The receptionist also added that most of the bathrooms in the hotel had the same issue, and that we shouldn't expect any better from a 30 year old hotel! As the staff couldn't guarantee that this would not happen in another room, we decided to check out, absolutely fuming by this stage. We found another hotel nearby for a comparable price for the rest of our stay - the other hotel was fantastic and of course all the facilities worked! We enjoyed the rest of our stay, and think that staying at Bills Gambling Hall & Casino was the worst decision we made in our entire trip to the USA. Never ever would I recommend it. Oh, and on one last thing, Bills charged a random sum of money of approx $300 to our credit card at some stage during our 2 night stay with them - they have still not refunded the money stating that they are unaware of the charge. The approx $300 neither reflects the initial deposit amount nor what should have been the total figure if we were to have stayed the full duration of our original booking. The charge was clearly identified as 'Bills Gamblin Hall' - exactly the same as the initial deposit. Of course it is being disputed.

Check-in was pretty quick and painless. There was virtually no line. I checked in super early at 11am (I had just finished a drive from LA and overestimated my ETA to the hotel), but they had no rooms available and told me that they had placed a rush order for my room and to come back at 1230pm. I came back at 130pm after picking up my sweetie from the airport and sure I was speedily given a key to my room. Btw, parking was a breeze. Lots of ample parking spots when I arrived. I had originally booked a nonsmoking king but they gave me two queens. Hmm...is something wrong here? Better yet, there was a caulking gun and paint bucket in my room. It looked like someone was in the middle of doing some touch-ups and forget to take their things away. I called the front desk and explained the problem, and after a brief shuffle, they moved me to another nonsmoking double queen room, which smelled heavily of smoke. Our beds did not have the same consistency; one bed was rock hard and the other bed was averagely average. We didn't bother calling the front desk again and decided to grin and bear with it, as we were only to stay for just a night. I was pretty worried about the noise level outside of the hotel because it is right next to Harrah's, but I was surprised how quiet it was. We were situated on the \"1st\" floor, which was, in reality, the 5th floor of the hotel. I slept pretty well on our average bed, so I was happy about that. Overall, the room was decent and designed for th budget minded. The bathroom was divided a bit weirdly, but the basics were covered: towels, shampoo, soap, cups, hairdryer, and a clothes rack (what the heck?). The large flat-screen TV was a nice addition in the room, but hey, it's just a TV. The casino was very small, which I kind of liked because you can never got lost in it. It is a lot smokier than other casinos because the ceilings aren't that high and aren't well ventilated. However, the casino is right next to the two entrances of the establishment, so that's basically the only ventilation for the casino. I'm torn. It is a decent, budget hotel--save for a few inconsistencies in my experience--in an excellent location (right in the middle of the strip), but it really needs to be renovated. I can't say much about customer service, but I can say that I was treated well and the people at the front desk were friendly and accommodating upon check-in.

Our room was on the 3rd floor room 102, right on the corner of the strip facing south and overlooking Ballys and the Bellagio fountains a prefect view, the room was very clean and spacious, although the bathroom sink area could have been a little bigger, the best thing about the bathroom was that they had a stained glass window that opened out so you could hear the strip, this was especially nice when the Bellagio fountains were on as we watched a few times from here and could hear the music. The bed was comfy and we had clean sheets and towels everyday. a large plasma tv on the wall was nice also and plenty closet and drawer space. We had a little noise from the strip due to being right at the front of the hotel on the corner but nothing that really bothered us. The casino is nice and small not too big like the other huge hotels so you could easily just go up to your room in no time at all.

We ate at the (\u201caward winning\u201d \u2013 which they don\u2019t mind announcing over and over again) Victorian Room a few times and found the food good and reasonably priced. If you like (Americanised) Chinese food, make sure you ask for the \u201cspecial\u201d Chinese menu as it offers a banquet style meal for much cheaper than the regular menu.

Don\u2019t miss Big Elvis, although you only need to see him once as the spiel begins to get cheesy after a couple of shows. We felt safe and secure at Bills and did not see any dodgy characters hanging around. There is a tix for tonight booth inside Bills which is very convenient when planning your day. There are ice machines on every floor and a bottle shop just down the (side) road if you like to BYO drinks. \u201cBills\u201d is perfectly located on the strip at a bargain price. It doesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles as the big resorts, but it is clean, comfortable, and walking distance to almost everywhere on the Strip (providing you are wearing comfortable shoes!).

Finally, a quick tip for any Aussie\u2019s reading this review and planning to play the slots in Las Vegas. Be aware that all wins over $US1200 are taxed at 30%.

I would happily recommend the place to a friend -- but maybe not a fussy friend. It is located smack in the middle of the strip, and is surprisingly clean and quiet. Despite the noise and lights of the strip, sleeping in as late as you want is no problem -- the room was nice and dark, and the air conditioning adequate even in July.

The staff are reasonably helpful and friendly, and they have plenty of TVs and 99-cent frozen margaritas. You can't miss their free house act, Big Elvis -- he's an obese Elvis impersonator with a decent voice. My favorite perk was that staying at Bill's gets you into the pool at the Flamingo next door, which was lots of fun. The free parking was nice, too. Bill's is a Harrah's property, and kind of a redheaded stepchild one at that. I wouldn't be surprised if they tore it down or gutted it to build something fancier because the location is so great.

Meanwhile, I consistently contributed to Bill\u2019s bottom line, a nickel at a time. The reason why this slot session lasted so long was because we waited about 40 minutes to be called in to dine at the Victorian Room coffee shop. While we did eventually enjoy our food, we decided it wasn\u2019t worth waiting around for. So we decided to order room service on the following mornings.

Check in: 5 stars. checked in at 9pm on Saturday and did not have to wait 1 second to check in. The check in lady was very nice, friendly and even hooked us up with a room with the strip view and the Fountain view at no extra cost. (usually these rooms are $20 extra a night). The room had two queen beds and was very roomy and nice. Hotel has that older theme but is very nice and the elevators are fast and roomy. The walk to the room was not that far. (see my pictures for visual review). The hotel has no pool so they let you use the Flamingo pool which is the best and soooo nice with waterfalls etc. The casino is nice but the payout is not that good. If you want the good payout and game, try Wheel of Fortune at the \"Orleans\". I started with $5 and ended up winning $430. The restaurant at Bill's is very nice and the all you can eat Chinese is very good deal. The coupon book they gave us at check in was somewhat nice with few coupons that were worth using.

I actually got a better price online than the relatively cheap one my friend was quoted fpr a group rate. Trip advisor had such great things to say about the place and seeing that we could use the Flamingo pool, I was looking forward to the trip. I got some tips from Trip advisor for checking in.

But at the price, I almost felt like i was stealing the room. I wish someone warned me to bring conditioner, they only supply one small shampoo. In these days of carry on luggage, I often depend on the shampoo/conditioner from the hotel. Its very basic at Bills. Use of the flamingo pool was easy and convenient. I don't recommend eating at Bills. The flamingo is just next door. Bills' givesy ou a coupon book with many $5. off for buffets and resturants at Flamingo, harrahs, ballys, IP, all right next to Bills. Food, water, etc, is still pretty expensive at the hotels.

You can park in the garage, and be in your room in < 5 mins. In many other casinos, getting to your car or the check out desk from your room entails an epic trek across the entire casino and/or shopping/eating areas. Not fun if you have large bags to carry. IMHO, the best feature about Bill's is precisely that it doesn't have many of the \"extras\" of the other casinos. If you want great shopping, more restaurants, or a more extensive gambling experience, Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, Flamingo, and Paris are all a 5 min. walk away.

On my last few visits to Las Vegas, I have stayed at Mirage, Harrah\u2019s, Excalibur and Treasure Island. Of those, I liked Treasure Island the best. On those trips, we have stumbled into Bill's Gambling Hall; a fun, old-school casino right on the strip. They have $2 hot dogs, $0.99 margaritas and $5 pitchers of beer. Despite not really being a big drinker myself, I do appreciate a cheap beverage. Why pay $15 for the same thing across the street at Caesars? This trip, I decided to be adventurous and book a room at Bill's. It\u2019s a small hotel above the casino with only four floors. I was so happy I did! This is not a big mega resort. There are only two restaurants, no gift shop other than a souvenir counter, no day spa and no pool. Guests are invited to use the Flaming pool next door, which is only a 2-3 minute walk. This walk is considerably shorter than the walk through most of the larger hotels to the pool. The Flamingo pool is gorgeous and has numerous water features, not to mention the flamingo and bird habitat adjacent to the pool. The elevator to the rooms is right next to the check-in desk in the back-end of the casino. The steakhouse and Victorian Room cafe are literally steps from the desk and elevator. Convenient internet access is right there as well. The hallway to our fourth floor room was clean, as was the elevator. The room was spotless. The bathroom was a bit dated, but clean. The room was huge! Very spacious, with new bedding and modern touches. There was also a brand new huge flat-screen TV on the wall. Other than typical Vegas street noise (screaming middle-aged women, drunk frat guys and sirens), the hotel was a quiet as can be on a Saturday night. The bed was comfortable and the mattress looked relatively new (I always check for bugs before crawling into bed). We paid just over $100 for Saturday night, and $40 for Sunday. What a bargain! The location could not be better. There is a bridge right outside the side entrance of the casino that takes you directly over to Caesars. It is a two minute walk to the Flamingo for taxi service, shows and the pool. It is also a less than 5 minute walk to Bally\u2019s, Paris, Harrah's, Imperial Palace, Mirage and others. The Venetian, Treasure Island and a host of others are also close. Also within a five minute walk are O'Sheas and Casino Royale for cheap food and cheap gaming. You save a ton on taxi service! For casinos further away, there is a monorail stop next door at Bally\u2019s or down the street at Imperial Palace. There is a small bar and lounge in the lobby that is packed all the time with fun bands, karaoke and a big fat singing Elvis. Upon checking in we were given coupons for restaurants and attractions in other Harrah's properties. We were given two free passes to the Auto Collection at Imperial Palace in which we spent and hour and a half. I am so glad we chose Bill's Gambling Hall. The room was perfect and we were able to spend the difference in money on food, tours and souvenirs. I would stay here again without hesitation.

I think it may have been part of a suite at some point as to get in you had to go through one door into a lobby area, off the lobby were two hotel rooms and a what looked like a parlour lounge area which was all locked up. Our room had a very retro feel, right down to a telephone in the huge bathroom! The bed wasn't particularly well made when we entered the room, but I've noticed this seems to happen sometimes with king size beds in hotels for some reason? Our room had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip which was cool. A very loud alarm went off at 4am one morning, some sort of fire alarm, warning us to \"stay in our room until further notice\" which was a little scary. Turns out water had got into the air con lines or something and triggered an alarm. Pretty minor inconvenience though. The location of Bill's just cannot be beat, especially for the price.

The room consisted of a large comfortable bed, two night tables spaced about a foot away from the bed on each side, 3 drawer dresser with a flat screen tv-possibly a 36 in. There was a desk with a straight back chair, dining talbe with 2 straight back chairs, Wi-fi was available. There was also one more chair in the corner. One think that I felt was lacking in the room was a stuffed comfortable chair. I enjoy sitting and relaxing in the room and not on the bed or a straightback chair.

If you want to be right where the action is - Bill's shares the intersection with Bellagio, Bally's and Caesars - so you can't get any more central than that. Checkin and checkout is a breeze at Bill's - there were always 2 people on the desk - we didn't ever notice a queue (in the larger casinos with over 2000 rooms we witnessed incredible queues at registration- maybe they were giving something away?) All of our questions were fielded promptly - help and advice was given - requests were filled - all with a smile. Our room included an oversized king bed, a desk and chair, a table and chairs, a dressing room and walkin robe and a separate bathroom. And the window of our room overlooked the fountains of Bellagio. We were on the top floor - and although the traffic noise was audible - we were suprised how little we actually heard! We were sleeping easily until 10 and 11 in the day without any external noise disturbances. Bill's has some great restaurants - the chinese food menu was excellent and we enjoyed the don perignon and fillet mignon special at the steakhouse for mother's day - silver service and scrumptious! On the downside - and these were minor - the bath/shower didn't drain quickly so you were standing in ankle deep water (picky I know), we could have used a fridge in the room because of the lenght of our stay, the internet was available but was an add on charge so you had to \"register\" each 24 hours, and avoid the dry cleaning service - sooo expensive.

It doesn't have a pool but you can use the Flamingo one (hotel next door) which is beautiful and large. A word of advise: many of the nicer spots are taken by 8:30 a.m. at the pool so if that's important, go early. The Victorian room restaurant isn't that big but certainly is busy. The service is usually fast except when they are really busy. The wait staff aren't overly friendly but the food is quite good with reasonable portions. It isn't cheap but reasonable compared to other places on the strip. They have breakfast specials before 6 a.m. & a prime rib dinner for $14.99 that runs 24 hours/day. The rooms are exactly as you see in their advertised pictures. The bathrooms do have a stained glass window that opens. The window in the room is like a patio door but does not open. Air conditioning worked great. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Our only complaint was that housekeeping did a poor job. We called the supervisor one morning to complain and there was only a slight improvement after that. Our ice bucket was left full of water each day with no new ice bag. No soap was left as well as the dirty cups were not replaced. The mirror in the bathroom as well as the hairdryer needed some cleaning. One day, our air conditioning was turned off and the heat turned on! The temperatures ranged in the high 90's on our visit so we didn't appreciate that much. We requested a coffee maker and got one but I wouldn't bother. I had to clean it as it had old coffee grounds caked inside and the coffee they give you is beyond disgusting. The front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating. When we mentioned some noise from service elevators next to our room they moved us to a view room (that is usually $20.00 night extra) without our asking for a change. The view was from the far side of our window & looked out at the Paris tower and the Bellagio fountains. It was nice to see but I wouldn't pay the extra money to see those things unless it is something that is very important to you. How long would you stand at the side of your window looking at them to warrant that extra money each night? There is a good amount of slot machines & tables for gambling & also a few bars. Seattle's coffee is at front of the casino. Coffee tastes better & is more reasonably priced than most places on the strip. They have a small assortment of squares/cookies too.

We were happy with and the level of cleanliness. Another reviewer commented that the bin etc was not emptied but we didn\u2019t have any problems with this \u2013 the service of the room was fine; and that their towels weren\u2019t changed \u2013 again we didn\u2019t have any problems with this, as with many other hotels in the area Bill\u2019s has a policy of only changing towels when you ask (ie indicated by placing them on the floor etc) to conserve water and we were happy to use the same towels for two nights. Our one problem was that there was quite a bit of traffic noise but I am guessing that this is probably the case with a lot of Las Vegas hotels. Also we had requested a room with a Strip view and we did get one sort of looking sideways down towards Paris Paris but in retrospect it might have been better to get a back-facing room that might not have had a view but might have been quieter. We also made a couple of non-local calls and were charged an exorbitant connection fee which was not made clear at all in the information about making calls that was provided in the room. Maybe our own fault but I still felt it was very disingenuous not to make it clear to people \u2013 we left the hotel with a bad taste in our mouths and the feeling we had been tricked. This, and the traffic noise, is the main reason why I\u2019m giving the hotel three stars rather than four. We didn\u2019t eat dinner at the hotel but we did have breakfast there one morning (cereal and fruit etc although cooked food was also available) \u2013 it was OK but for the second more morning we realised it only cost a few more dollars to go to the all-you-can eat breakfast buffet at Treasure Island (or presumably other breakfast buffets), which was much better value. We\u2019d recommend the buffet at Treasure Island (we also had dinner there one night) as mid-range ie while not the cheapest nor the fanciest it was good quality and had a wide choice.

It is directly across from Bally's, next door to Flamingo and diagonally across from the Bellagio. This allowed us to get to all the nice sites and casinos in good time considering all the foot traffic and stops at the many shops in every casino. It is also the location of Tix 4 Tonight which sells discount tickets to shows for that night as well as discounts to different restaurants. They post the schedule at 9:30am and start selling at 10. The line starts forming around 9:30ish and things do sell out so get there early for best options. We preferred walking up the strip toward the Venetian and Fashion Show Mall as opposed to the other direction - MGM and Luxor. It was a much nicer walk toward Venetian. The walk toward MGM is not nearly as nice, lots of construction and cheap looking places...although maybe there were bargains to be found. My husband and I arrived late on Thursday night and had no wait to check-in to our room. The first room we had was on the Flamino side and was quiet, but it was equipped with a handicapped restroom (room 256?) which my husband was not comfortable with. We asked to change rooms and for our trouble we were upgraded to a room with a view ( Bally's). This room (#462) was quite a bit different than the previous. It was not renovated and was a little weird and the view was not worth the added expense if you choose to upgrade. The one plus was that the shower had a steam vent in it and it worked very well. This room was very noisy due to the street noise as well as the room next door. To enter this room, you had to go through a common door that lead to 2 rooms and this exterior door made a lot of noise when the people in the other room came and went. The next day we asked to be moved again to the quiet side of the hotel. Once again the staff was extremely accomodating. We were put in room 451, a few doors down from 462 on the opposite side of the hall. This room was renovated as you can see from the pictures I've included. We were told that you can hear the fans from the Flamingo at all times. This did not bother me because it was a low hum...similar to white noise and I believe it probably helped me to sleep better, however if you think this will bother you, stay away from this room and inquire about the room you do get to make sure you are away from the fans. As far as the size, the rooms were spacious and the size of the hotel is not overwhelming like much of the rest of Las Vegas is. You can get to the street from your room in less than 5 minutes, which I hear is not the case w/ the larger hotels...(15-20 min). I don't know about you, but I like to maximize my time and that does not include taking 15-20 minutes to get to/from my room out to the street. The other benefit is check-in and check-out time was seemless and quick. Again, maximize your time. We went to use the pool at the Flamingo and couldn't believe the excessive check-in line at the reception desk. I'm sure people would be in that line for at least 30-60 minutes. We took advantage of the $5.49 steak and egg special in the Victorian Room. It came with 2 eggs, hash browns, toast and the steak. Everything was good except the steak...to be expected for $5.49. We can now say we were able to take advantage of one of those unbelievable great food deals, but you do get what you pay for and there are so many good restaurants to choose from, why waste your calories on mediocre food. Some of the great free things to do while you are there are: 1. Bellagio fountains - these are shown every 30 minutes in the day and every 15 minutes at night and they are played to one song. 2. Bellagio Conservatory - this is a changing exhibit and is well worth your time. 3. Sirens of Treasure Island - this is a Risky Pirate show in front of Treasure Island, get there early for a decent view. This show (15 - 20 minutes) starts at 7pm and then is shown every 90 minutes after. It was well done, but may not be suitable for children. 4. Volcano at Mirage - hourly shows starting at 8 pm.

The hotel is an older one, and was not meant for the traffic that they get in the lobby. The front desk isn't situated in the best place, but the desk clerks were very pleasant as were the bell boys. The one bell boy in particular was very pleasant and remembered us when we needed to store our luggage at check out as we had a later flight! Once we got to our rooms, we were very pleased.

The casino is a bit smokey but it is not as bad as some casinos in Las Vegas. The smoke does tend to travel up with the elevator (we were on the second floor) but even though I have some bronchial problems I did OK when we were not in the casino for too long. We don't gamble but we did stay for the 'Big Elvis' show and that was fun. Bellagio view? We arrived at the casino before noon and they had a room ready for us. We did not ask for but were given (at no additional cost) a room facing the strip where we could see the Bellagio fountains. But you really can't hear the music too well from the room due to all the street noise so it was not that enjoyable to view from the room. I certainly would not pay extra for a Bellagio fountain view because it is not that far to walk to get the whole experience which is so much better to be right there with the music and the power of the fountain waters. Sound resistant walls: It appears that all the doors to the hotel rooms have about a one inch gap at the bottom and because of that, noise would filter in & out of rooms. But I am more adverse to sound coming through the walls and we had no problem with hearing anyone through the walls from the rooms on either side of us for the whole duration of our stay. I just used a towel to put at the bottom of our door and kept it in a drawer to use each night. The drapes on the window were heavy enough to keep the room dark after the sun came up in the morning. Outside, across the street, off to the left of our window was a large LED screen with rotating pictures and the drapes were helpful in eliminating that light as well. Some have mentioned that there was a security guard at the elevator but we never saw one and we were in and out a lot. But, I never felt insecure about my safety except for the not so secure looking door lock when we first arrive. I guess I got use to it. Also, I never found any employees at Bill's that were friendly but I never encountered any who were rude. A little indifferent maybe, but not down right rude. Roomy and clean rooms: The rooms at Bill's are a nice size to move about in easily - a king bed, desk, 2 side tables, a double dresser and a small round table with 2 chairs. There is a big screen TV on the wall that we could view while sitting in bed. It came in handy for the news. There is no weather channel available though. The carpet was very clean and I felt comfortable walking in my bare feet. The bedding was clean and neat and nothing in the room was tattered looking. And the pillows smelled free of odors. The bathroom is a bit small - one sink with maybe 6\" on one side and 2 feet of counter space on other side. We were able to scrunch both of us in at the sink counter at one time, it was doable but cramped. With a little cooperation between us we were able to alternate sink times. The closet area (in the bathroom) was maybe 3 or so feet of space. The toiletries were minimal but enough for our stay. There is a hair dryer, an iron and ironing board in the bath room. On close inspection of the caulking around the tub I found only a couple small mildewed stained areas. All the tile grout looked very clean. That was our room experience. Well, I think I pretty much covered the rooms of the hotel so the following info is about a few other experiences at the hotel and then outside on the streets of Las Vegas. I hope our experience will be helpful to you. Bill's for breakfast: We ate breakfast one late morning in the hotel restaurant. It was about 11:00 am and we had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated. We shared an omelet which was just so-so. The service was slow and our server was not very attentive. The 99 cent margaritas are in the back, straight back form the elevator (with elevator on your left side) at a small bar. They are small margaritas and there isn't much alcohol in them. They didn't seem worth it to me. Free Big Elvis show: We kept missing the Big Elvis show because we did not realize that the small number of seats get taken 45 mins or so before the show begins. If you don't get a seat then you have to stand and I found myself in the way of people trying to move to and fro so we left. After learning when the show times were we managed to get a seat on the last day of our visit. He really does a good job of sounding like Elvis. I am not a very big fan of Elvis' music when he was into the Las Vegas scene and that is primarily the songs that Big Elvis sings. But, it was the showmanship and his interactions with other people and how much others got into the show that made it so much fun. Before he came out we were told that he had lost 500 lbs over a few months sometime during this last year. Sorry, I don't remember the amount of time. The show is free. Convenience store: If you would like to purchase your own alcohol for less money then you can easily walk to a handy little convenience store nearby. When you walk out of the entrance to Bill's (entrance closest to the elevators), make a left and walk about 2 blocks (approx. 106 Flamingo RD.), there on your left around the right side of the building next to the parking lot is the store connected to the back side of a store front casino. The prices there were better than some places along the strip. This being 2009 in Vegas, you can walk with your own drink down the street or into the casinos. My husband & I share our meals so going to the Buffet for us is not a good enough deal. I thought that an awful lot of restaurants along the strip were too expensive so we ate in some of the indoor malls at the food courts where the prices were better. We would have driven off the strip but we were without a car. We walked nearly everywhere we went because there is one place after another to stop and see. Also, it is great when you have to find a restroom because they are all right there in the casinos for anyone to use. Deuce Double Decker bus: We did get a 24 hour pass one day to ride the Deuce Double Decker bus down to Fremont Street Experience, downtown for the evening light show & then later back to the hotel. The next day, we road the Deuce all the way to it's transit center but for the return trip ride everyone had to disembark at the transit center and board another bus. The Deuce bus does not stop just anywhere you want along the line. There is one stop in Front of the Flamingo Hotel and to learn of the others just do an internet search on The Deuce Las Vegas. It cost us $7.00 each for a 24 hour pass or $3.00 one way. A 24 hour pass only got us 4 good rides. You still have to walk in-between bus stops and sleep sometime during that 24 hours. If you have a group it might be better to take a cab. The Deuce will also take you to the outlets mall. City bus to and from airport: My husband and I flew into Las Vegas airport and took the city bus to Flamingo Rd. where we then walked to Bill's (about a 2 mile walk) but you can stay on the bus until you get to Desert Inn Rd. and then take the monorail to the MGM and then walk to Bill's (10 min. walk). On the return trip to the airport it is much easier. You walk about one mile east on Flamingo Rd (toward Paradise Rd.) and catch the city bus off of Paradise Rd to the airport. The bus was only $1.75 per person - that is much less than any other means of transport back and forth. Just make sure you have the correct change because the bus driver does not have change to give you. You could also take a bus east on Flamingo Rd. and get off at Paradise Rd. for the bus to the airport. This mode of transport is customary in a lot of other countries we have visited and we look at is as part of the adventure and good exercise for the body and mind. For times and bus schedules just do an internet search for Las Vegas transportation. Also, google maps provides public transportation information for where ever you need to go, if transport is available there. Fremont Street Experience: Last year I was in Vegas with 3 girlfriends (we drove) and the Fremont Street Experience (a 90-foot LED graphic display canopy and 540,000 watt sound system) was really cool but this year they were not showing the same light show and I did not like it at all. Also, this year the center walkway in this downtown location was full of street vendors with their carts and the atmosphere was not as festive. Pasta Pirate Restaurant: That evening downtown looking for a place to eat, my husband and walked out of Fremont St. and took a right on East Ogden Ave. We walked about 2 blocks (12 East Ogden Ave.) to the California Hotel & Casino and found a restaurant there named 'Pasta Pirate' (there were others also). We did not have a reservation so we had to wait about 15 mins in the lounge which was comfortable and the beer was only $3.00 ea. We shared the Chicken Portobello for $17 and it was wonderful and a lot of food. They also include a glass of house wine (it was not to my liking) and a salad. They split it for us at no additional charge. It also comes with white rolls but we don't eat white flour products so we asked if they had any bread that was whole wheat. They did not but our waitress immediately asked the bus boy to go next door (without our suggesting) where they had whole wheat rolls and gave us those at no extra charge. Even when we first entered the restaurant the hostess was very friendly as well as the bartender in the lounge. Nearly every patron there was having the 6 oz. filet with the baby lobster tail, including glass of house and house vegetables and pasta or rice with bread and soup or salad for $19. It looked amazing and the next time I go that is what I will order. From the demeanor of the other patrons, I gathered that quite a few of them were locals. If you want to see their menu, do a search online - it's all there. Oh, and the atmosphere was cozy. I have been in some very swanky places on business trips and I must say that our experience with the employees at the Pasta Pirate was top class. I hope that is the rule there and not the exception. The M & M store on the strip is my favorite store because there are so many cute products to purchase or just look at. Some are very expensive and some are very inexpensive. Free show at Venetian: We also happened upon a free show in the Venetians Grand Canal Shoppes in St. Mark's Square. It was 3 women looking like statues (referred to as The Living Statues) with water coming out of their finger tips and hair tops. When the music started they began making slow and graceful movements. I don't know what time of day it generally occurs but I would imagine that the Concierge would know. Antique Car show: Bill's gave us a coupon to The Antique Car Show at the Imperial Palace. We we able to go for free and there are some really incredibly bizarre looking old cars there. There are 3 or so very large rooms full of old cars and other old items that are interesting to see since it is free with the coupon. I would not pay more than a few dollars to see it but my husband would probably have payed more since he finds that sort of thing more interesting than I do. If you have not been to Las Vegas in quite a long time or never, then you might be surprised at how much skin is displayed on big screens and billboards that travel up and down the street, all in BIG view of little eyes.

Just for the record, Bill\u2019s is not The Bellagio or The Venetian, so please don\u2019t expect those types of accommodations or amenities . But for what we paid, Bill\u2019s offered above average (3 star) accommodations at a great location (in the middle of the Strip). The staffed at the front desk were very nice and got us to our room very quickly. Upon entering the room, we thought the room was very clean and well kept. The room looked just like the photo on the website. The bed was firm and comfortable. My wife and I slept very well. On a guy note, the flat screen TV was wonderful. The heating and AC worked very well. To our liking, the cleaning crew comes early. We hate leaving a hotel room in the morning (9ish) and coming back to an unclean room. The cleaning crew at Bill\u2019s does a great job cleaning the rooms in a timely manner. You can hear noise in the hallway (when people come in late intoxicated) and from the strip, but it\u2019s not unbearable or loud enough to wake you when sleeping. For the most part, the hotel is pretty quiet. The bathrooms are in need of remodeling, but they were clean and fitted our needs. However, we did encounter a drainage problem in the tub. I called the front desk the next day to notify them and they said they would dispatch a technician to address it. They had three days to address the problem and never did. Getting out the shower with about foot of water in the tub (as it slowly drained) was a bit of a nuisance. But we considered the drainage problem a minor irritation and it didn\u2019t ruin our view of the hotel. Recap If you're celebrating an anniversary (or something of that nature), I would suggest that you just pay the extra $70-$100 a night and stay at a nicer hotel with more amenities. But if you are looking for a decent hotel with clean rooms and a great location so you can get a taste of Vegas, Bill\u2019s is the place. We would definitely stay at Bill\u2019s again. Couple of things to note: For those renting a car, Bill\u2019s has a free parking garage that always seemed to have plenty of parking. We had not trouble finding a space 2 days we rented a car. The \u00bd price show tickets booth located at Bill\u2019s seemed to always has a huge line. I would suggested going to Fashion Square mall or further up the strip to another \u00bd price show tickets booth for tickets. There aren\u2019t many cabs waiting in front of Bill\u2019s. I guess because it\u2019s a smaller hotel. The Concierge can call you cab, but we needed to get to the airport and didn\u2019t have time to wait.

Also for the shampoo, conditioner and lotion - sometimes they were refilled and sometimes they were not. And even though they refilled them for you, the bottles were never been closed. They don't have shower caps (but there was a hair dryer in the bathroom) and adapter converter so you have to buy it yourself. I bought one converter from ABC store in Miracle Mile shops. The TV screen was huge-I love it! However, I think they can improve more on their services in both housekeeping-as mentioned above and the front office. They didn't seem very helpful to me and kept me waiting for their answers most of the time that I had to call to ask again.

Bathroom was great and seemed to be a constant supply of hot water whatever time you took shower/bath. The casino itself was very friendly - we played on the slots mostly. Highly recommend signing up for the 'players club card' (its freee!), - we didnt gamble enough to gain many points on the card but when you sign up you are given a book of vouchers for money off food and 'buy one get one free' tickets for various top attractions. Bills is in an amazing location - previously stayed at the Luxor but you are a long way from the centre of the strip, with Bills you are very central although the deuce bus is fantastic value - ride for 24 hrs for $7. We also drove to the mountains for 2 days ski-ing - approx 1 hr drive from the strip, returning to Bills at night. Can recommend Brooks car hire just down the strip. Collected us from our hotel and great service. We were struggling to hire a car from the usual big names as apparently there was a big conference on but Brooks were able to sort us out with an hours notice otherwise our ski-ing trip would not have happended. Can recommend Grand Tours for a Grand Canyon trip to the west rim/ sky walk. $125 compared to many charging in excess of $185 for the same thing. Again great service.

We also chose this hotel based on previous reviews and we were not disappointed. I contacted the hotel directly after seeing the prices for room rates on the internet a few months previous to our travel and booked directly with the hotel rather than online with no issues. I noticed about one month prior to travel that the room rates were $25.00 USD lower than what I had booked during the same time period. I called the hotel and it was not an issue to get the lower rate for our stay. This allowed us two rooms for basically the price of one which meant 'no sleeping with our young adult sons'! Noise - was our only issue. Our room was on the street side - it helped to leave our bathroom door shut at night and earplugs cut out the rest of the noise. Our boys who were across the hall said they had no noise issues. We stayed at this hotel for five nights. There was security present (outside the elevators) on only two out of the the five nights although we didn't find it an issue other than some late night, loud guests going to their rooms. The rooms were spacious and clean. The location is excellent and we were pleasantly surprised with not having to pay for parking our car. There was always plenty of parking available. The purpose of our trip was shopping and shows, not gambling so the location of this hotel was ideal for both. It was great to have a car as we went to both outlet malls to shop. Yes, there is no fancy reception area but from reviews of other hotels it sounds like you spend a lot of time in line ups - checking in/out. We were the only ones at the desk to check in as well as to check out - no line ups here! The pictures on the website are exactly what you get. I was impressed that with the amount of smoking in the casino that there were no odors in the rooms. We requested non smoking rooms.

It's always a popular place as the parking is free, unlike some casinos. The hotel is located right in the middle of the strip, next door to Ballys and Flamingo and opposite Bellagio. You can walk to any on-strip casino within 10 minutes, location wise it's the most central of anywhere on the strip. Additionally, Rio and the Palms are only 1 mile up Flamingo, the road to the side of the hotel. The check-in staff were super efficient and our room was very clean and spacious with a large TV and king size bed. I had no complaints about the facilities other than I couldn't get a wifi connection as advertised. There are a couple of eating establishments in the casino, but given the central location you're never far away from somewhere to eat anyway. Apparently they also sell $1 frozen cocktails in the hotel, although we didn't see where. The only complaint I would have is the noise; the rooms, in common with a lot of Vegas hotels, are not well soundproofed and given that the hotel is opposite the Bellagio you will hear the fountain music every 15 minutes until midnight if you choose to go to bed early! If you've never been, Las Vegas is a noisy place and the weekday traffic will wake you at 7am with horns and loud engines.

For gambling and drinks, I would suggest popping around the corner, towards IP, and checking out Casino Royale. The drinks there were cheap and strong with a choice of bottle beer (Michelob) for $1, which is $6 elsewhere on the strip. The waitresses were always on top of things here too.

I booked on the strength of reports here and because it is small and low rise and mid Strip. It was perfect for us. It was our eighth trip to Vegas and we have stayed in various hotels including the Venetian and Aladdin. Bill's is not in the themed luxury bracket but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the rooms and we will be staying there again. The only things which would have improved it would have been an in-room safe and coffee/tea facilities. We used the safety deposit facility at the Cashier's desk which is free but they ask for a $60 cash deposit which is refunded when the key is turned in. We were lucky enough to get a side view of the fountains at no extra cost (but New Year's Eve was triple the price anyway!), from room 428. The room was bigger than I expected with plenty of space for storage. The bathroom space is small but adequate and I was glad to see a bath as pacing up and down the Strip all day needs a bath to soak in at the end of the day. Something we didn't get at Excalibur. The window in the bathroom was great but obviously made it noisy when left open. Generally we did not find it too noisy to sleep. The TV was huge! Parking was easy too as we arrived on Flamingo Road from the Hoover Dam direction and there is a multi storey car park which is clearly visible. Check in and out was easy with no queue which is rare in Vegas. The staff were all courteous and friendly. The carpets in the casino part have seen better days but that didn't worry us as we are not gamblers. Big Elvis is worth watching and there was another live band who were very good. The 99c Margaritas were also very nice! Couldn't fault it despite my initial reservations that it may be a bit tatty and attract the wrong sort! Sadly the nature of Vegas attracts all walks of life - some undesirable, but we did not encounter any hookers or obvious 'low life'. We did not use any other facilities there but will definitely use Bill's on our next visit, assuming the price is still competetive.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrogate, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "angwri", "ReviewID": "UR23106915", "Content": "The location is the main point for staying at Bills.

There was also a security guard at the ground floor elevator, to make sure that only guests are given access to the rooms. A great idea.

Two days before our trip, I called Bill's and asked if there would be any problem getting a non-smoking room with two beds, plus a rollaway cot., even though we'd be arriving at about midnight. I was assured there would be no problem. When we arrived, I was given a key card by a bored and eventually quite rude desk clerk. Upon finding that the room had *one* bed and was *not* non-smoking, I called the desk guy, who told me that we had no guarantees since we booked through Travelocity and that he would send up a rollaway. The bellman arrtived 15 minutes later with the news that all the rollaways were being used, and all he had for me was some blankets and a pillow! I asked the desk clerk to get us a different room somewhere, and he said that was impossible and all I could do was speak to the manager the next day. After also trying and failing to get through to someone at Travelocity, I gave up and went to sleep on the floor, as we had a full day planned for tomorrow. When I spoke to the manager the next day, she apologized and said our reservation had been \"screwed up\". She upgraded our room to a non-smoking double with a side view (big deal) but said that's all she could do. After getting home, I contacted Travelocity and asked for a partial refund. After some time, they told me Bill's had \"met their obligation\" to me, had provided a rollaway on the first night, and had upgraded us for the rest of the stay, so no refund was possible. I reiterated that they did *not* provide a rollaway, that the manager had admitted that the reservation was screwed up, and the so-called \"upgrade\" was insufficient compensation for having to sleep on the floor. Travelocity finally agreed to refund the money out of their own pocket. (I waited for all of this to happen before posting this review.) I will never stay at Bill's or *any* other Harrah's property again (unless I'm comped to one).

They also do margarita cocktails for $1 and hotdogs 24hrs a day for $2 which is handy for a snack.

AMENITIES If you are into gambling, this is probably good enough for you. There is nightly entertainment and full out gambling.

I wasn't aware, but you can smoke pretty much everywhere in Vegas, and this hotel is no exception, so be prepared for the smell of smoke.

When we got to the hotel, we told them we were there for our anniversary and were upgraded to a room with a view at no charge. The casino (well, the whole hotel) is small, but that actually is an advantage at the end of a long day of walking or a night out partying. We could walk in the doors of the casino and be in the room in less than five minutes. I also liked that a security guard was at the elevators every night checking for room keys. All the staff we encourtered were friendly. We were on the first level above the casino in a corner room (if you look at a photo of Bill's at night, you can see on the corner above the round sign there's a light shining on a window \u2014 that was our room). We had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and could even hear the music if we opened the window in the bathroom. The room was actually bigger than it looks in pictures. There is not closet, per se, but there is a place to hang clothes by the sink in the bathroom (the sink is separate from the toilet and bathtub). A previous reviewer mentioned something about smelling smoke in their room, but we didn't experience this at all. The room was quite clean and up to date. Housekeeping did a very good job and never woke us up. I did notice that there was noise from the street, but I popped in some earplugs and was fine. If you're a light sleeper, you may want to do the same. It's hard to complain about the noise, though, seeing as how it's Vegas. My husband was not bothered by the noise at all. Bill's has also added a poker \"room\" (really it's a roped-off area) with very low- and no-limit Texas Hold'em. Had pretty good luck there. We ordered room service several times. The food (from the Victorian Room restaurant) was OK, but service declined as the week went on. Also, the last day or two we were there, the water temperature was a bit sketchy. It would get very hot for a second, then regulate. However, because the 4th of July crowd came in over the last few days of our stay, we might have experienced this no matter where we were, so I don't really count these last issues against the hotel. We had full use of Flamingo's pool at no charge, which was a plus. However, be forewarned: This pool has VERY COLD WATER. VERY cold.

Shhh!\u201d", "Author": "HopSkipJump", "ReviewID": "UR18022791", "Content": "If you're looking for a GREAT VALUE in a GREAT LOCATION, this is the place. First, the location: 1. On the northeast corner of East Flamingo Road and Las Vegas Bl 2. The other three corners of this intersection have: a. Northwest Corner --- Caesar's Palace b. Southwest Corner --- Bellagio c. Southeast Corner --- Bally's (with Paris Las Vegas next to it) 3. On the north side of the hotel (away from the intersection) is the Flamingo. You cannot be more central to the Strip than being at this hotel. Now, let's get realistic. This is a 3-star hotel -- a good, solid property without the WOW of all of the other famous 4-star and 5-star hotels. If you want the WOW, stay somewhere else; if not, then Bill's is your place. My room (#428) was on the south side of the hotel (top floor) and cost me $49 (including tax with a AAA discount). Without the discount, the room is $5 more. I had a view of Bally's and the right half of the 'Eiffel Tower' of Paris Las Vegas, peeking out from behind Bally's. I had a king-size bed, a writing desk, a little table and two chairs, a dresser with 6 large drawers and a flat screen TV (which I never turned on). To be honest, the bed was a little lumpy. It took a few minutes, the first night to find a comfortable area on the bed but after that, no problem. The bath was modern and had a frosted stained-glass window in the tub/shower -- a nice touch. Water pressure and soaps, etc were good. The front desk (reception) personnel were not terribly friendly. They weren't unfriendly but they didn't smile much. I checked in at 1:45 pm and there was only one person in front of me. When I checked out, at 12:30 (after requesting a late checkout, which they gave me with no hesitation) there was no one in front of me. The availability of late checkout depends on how many people are checking in for that day so don't get mad if they deny you the ability for this checkout. I took a free 'craps' lesson at 10:30, one morning in the casino (the lessons are given daily) and I have to say, I was almost as confused after the lesson as before but maybe you'll have a better experience. (They give you a book of rules but that still didn't help much). The BEST part of the hotel is the free access to the pool area at the Flamingo Hotel that is next door. It takes 30 seconds to walk from Bill's to the entrance of the Flamingo (they are separated by a 2-lane driveway). The walk to the pool area takes a few minutes through the Flamingo Hotel but it's easy to navigate. The pool area (which opens at 8 a.m. and has some people lining up at 7 to claim chairs) is, in my view, the best that Las Vegas has to offer. There are 5 pools, as I recall. There is a cool, spiral slide that empties into one, then 2 more pools that are connected by smaller slides, then the main pool which is huge with a waterwall at one end that you can swim under; lastly, there's an 'adult only' pool (topless is ok). Adjacent to the pool is a mini zoo of a sorts with, you guessed it, Flamingos (black ones) and some other water creatures. There is also a wing of hotel shops that is adjacent to the pool area. I spent a solid 1/2 day at this pool area and truly enjoyed myself: rode the slides, met some nice people in the pool and chatted, and swam, of course. I regretted not having the time to return. There were kids there but everyone was very well-behaved, surprising given the scarcity of available seating in thIs GIANT pool area. I, too, found the casino a little bit smoky but I found most of the smoke to be in the late afternoon and evening. If you want to gamble and don't like smoke (as I don't), gamble early. (There are also 'smoke free casinos' and 'smoke free areas' in some casinos. The other thing to remember is that the casino is on the corner of the aforementioned streets. The reception area for the hotel is in a tiny corner of the casino that is accessible from an entrance on East Flamingo Road (or you can enter the casino from Las Vegas Bl and walk through it to reception). The hotel elevators are 20' from reception. So, if you want to avoid the smoke of the casino, come down the elevator, exit onto Flamingo Road, turn right (walking along the exterior wall of the casino, until you reach the intersection of Las Vegas Bl) and then turn left or right onto Las Vegas Bl, and you're on your way -- smokeless!. As mentioned by a previous poster, the casino, by Las Vegas standards, is small and is a simple rectangle (also, unusual for LV). So, it's easy to navigate from the elevators and front desk area to the Las Vegas Bl exits. I visited the hotel at their website and, as a result, made my reservation by calling the 800 number that I found there.

The rooms look clean and it's spacious, however there's a strong smell in the hallway. I'm not sure if it's because the hotel is one of the oldest, or it's smoke smell. Another thing that bothered me is that you can hear every whisper in the hallway from the room! Also, the coffee maker I got in my room was very dirty & stained inside! However, one good thing I liked about it is that, there is always a security guard in front of the elevators checking your room keys through out the night. My conclusion is that, it is a great deal, but I personally would much prefer newer/fresh smelling hotels.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cDouble Check Everything\u201d", "Author": "roldog13", "ReviewID": "UR17899307", "Content": "I just recently returned from a Vegas trip which was a birthday present for my father's 75th birthday. First off - this is NOT a 5 star hotel. If you are used to hotels like MGM, Mandalay Bay, Rio, etc..this is not the place for you. However, since the trip was for my father - I have to give credit that my parents did like the hotel mainly that you could not \"get lost\" in it. They were able to split up and meet up again in the casiono with little to no problems (and since my dad is not the cell phone carrying type - this was a big plus). So here were my thoughts on the hotel. The good - Small enough that you could navigate through the casino easily and the table limits during the day were perfect ($3- $5 minimum) for the non-highroller. Also the cocktail waitresses visited all the tables very often so you did not have to wait 15 min for a drink. The rooms were very spacious and clean and the flat screen TV's had a good picture (not that you came to Vegas to watch TV but they looked cool). The location was great. You were in the middle of everything and a literal stones throw away from the Flamingo where you could hop on the monorail if so desired. Bally's and Bellagio were also within a 1-3 min walk. The bad - There are 2 sets of elevators here. 1 set for the hotel and another for the parking garage. We arrived Friday morning and Friday night one of the parking garage elevators broke down. When we checked out on Monday, the elevator was still broken. So there were long lines to get in and out of the hotel (if you brought/rented a car) and there is no A/C in the elevators or garage. The casino is a bit smokey but tolerable. The Worst - I have to take some responsibility on this since I booked 2 rooms (one for my girlfriend and I and the other for my aparents) and the other room was in my mother's name. My mother did not have her license with her so they refused to let us check into the 2nd room. However, I showed the front desk clerk my itinerary from Expedia which showed the flight and hotel info with all our names with the same last name. Both rooms were paid with my credit card - yet she still refused. So I called Expedia and they told me that they could not change the names on the account but they would speak to the hotel for me. I offered my cell to the desk clerk and she stated that she could not take the call from my cell. So Expedia called the hotel directly. She even gave Expeida trouble on the phone. This clerk was not friendly, extremely UNhelpful, and in the end said that I was frustrating her. My check-in process took over an hour and she was frustrated..poor thing. Anyway - had there been no problems with check-in, my opinion of the hotel would probably be better. But the hotel itself should not suffer from it's staffs unprofessionalism.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Tx", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Hotel And Casino\u201d", "Author": "bandd91", "ReviewID": "UR17876961", "Content": "We booked a hotel flight package through USAIRWAYS,(I highly recommend this).

It was a great place to stay in if you don't have small kids and don't stay in the hotel most of the time as there is not much entertainment in the hotel except for casino.

Bill's has a fantastic location, right in the middle of the strip and once you step out of the hotel, it's within minutes to the other grand hotels nearby - Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood which has great things to view/shop, but which you would have to pay several times more to stay in. Bill's is also steps away from the Deuce bus stop at Flamingo, which we took to the Las Vegas Outlet Centre and Premium Outlets for our shopping sprees. It is also a pickup location that tour companies and airport shuttles will not miss as it's surrounded by other popular hotels. I must also compliment the Victoria Room which is the 24hrs hotel restaurant. It always has a long queue and the waiting diners on list will be announced via the PA system. The Chinese food served was very nice and in huge portions, and the steam rice, tea and coffee were free and free-flowing too! Not to mention that we were served by a very friendly and helpful waiter on our second time there. The only thing is that for the 4th July stay, the price is 3 times the normal rate, as it's a public holiday.

Boy, do I wish we would have just shelled out $50 or so more to stay at another hotel... The disappointment hit as soon as we arrived. Upon arrival we found the desk, but no one was there. We waited for five minutes then asked someone in the Victorian Room restaurant if someone could check us in. The lady said she would call someone and it took another 5 minutes or so for the desk lady to finally show up! If there isn't a line at the desk there is no reason for a wait. Even Motel 6 has someone at the counter! The room did look just like the picture, which was a pleasant surprise, but was less than satisfactory after being there for a minute. It stated that there was a safe in the room, but there wasn't. For some reason they put us in a handicap room (unless they are all accessible like that) and the bathroom was terrible. There wasn't a tub...accessible...so there was just a bunch of drains on the floor. Well, the drains were in the wrong places so when you took a shower the whole bathroom would flood and be a sopping mess for hours. It was a colder than usual weekend and the lack of covers on the bed wasn't helpful. There was only a sheet and a small blanket that barely covered the two of us. When I asked for more blankets or a comforter I was told that they didn't have any extra. This was also the worst room for noise I have ever stayed in!! There was about an inch gap between the floor and the bottom of the door so everything going on in the hall was heard quite clear! People were hanging out in the hallway all night both nights we stayed. Also, there was tons of noise from the parking garage right outside our window (from the Flamingo). The staff was absolutely horrible! Every time we tried to call the desk no one answered. If we needed anything we would have to walk to the desk and then wait for another staff member to track down the desk person. The whole time we were there I never saw anyone standing at the desk. They could never help with anything...blankets, getting people to stop partying in hallways, etc. At checkout the lady asked us if we enjoyed our stay and when I started saying that we hadn't she totally cut me off, handed me the receipt, and walked away.

It has been re-done, but still feels like it is straight out of the 70's. The casino is smoky and the rooms are not huge. There is no pool, but you are allowed to use the pool at the Flamingo (5 min walk.) We ate in both restaurants. The Victorian Room is great for a late night breakfast or dinner, and the Steakhouse was perfect for a good meal with food friends in a retro environment. We did not go into the night club, Drai's, but there was a big line of good looking young folks trying to get in. Probably a good place for a late night pick-up if you are single. Although Bill's is not anything like the other Mega Resorts in Vegas, there is something a bit special about the place. There was a buzz in the casino everytime we walked through the doors. The bar has great specials ($2.25 Bud/Bud Light aluminums 16 oz) and is a welcome relief from the $13 drinks we were buying at Mandalay Bay. The table games are usually $5-$10 minimums and the dealers are much friendlier (Not to mention better looking) than at the bigger casinos. We placed a few bets at the sports book, and although it is smaller than most other rooms in town, the variety of bets that could be placed were matched only at the Hilton.

Bathroom was in great clean condition, we had a bath as well as a shower. Our window faced the Flamingo hotel and the strip itself.

I would also recommend the Victorian Room in the casino for dining, it is fairly cheap and the food is of a good quality. The only thing that let it down a few times was the speed of the service.

It was great to walk through the doors on Flamingo Road and be at the check-in counter in about 10 seconds. The elevators were right nearby, and it took us only about a minute or two to get to our 1st-floor (above the ground level) room. We had a room near the southeast end of the hotel, so we were able to see Bally's, the top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris, and a bit of Bellagio out the window. The room was clean. The bed wasn't as comfy as a Heavenly Bed at Westin, but it was okay. The bathroom area was a little small, but it was perfectly fine. The shower head was a little low, but we're not excessively tall, so it wasn't a big deal. There was a nice wall-mounted 42\" plasma TV--biggest TV I've had in a hotel room. The hotel is nicely situated on the Strip. And the casino was small enough that even when we walked all the way through the casino to get to the elevators, we never felt tempted to gamble. Sorry, Las Vegas--we didn't spend a penny in any of your casinos. Compared to the loooooong, tortuous walks we took through the Flamingo, Caesar's Palace, and Planet Hollywood, a relatively tiny place like Bill's was great.

You don't need to walk for what seems like miles to get to the street like a lot of the other strip hotels as it is right on the street. On check in we requested a fridge, coffee maker and extra pillows,which we had when we got to the room.

We mostly heard police/ambulance sirens which we hear at home anyway as we live near a Police station.

It\u2019s not the most glitzy, in fact it\u2019s easy to ignore and walk straight passed. It doesn\u2019t have hundreds of rooms, or swanky suites with every mod-con you can imagine. There isn\u2019t a fancy shopping mall, or a reception/foyer area designed by the latest award-winning interior designer. Nor is there a Michelin-starred chef designing the menus for the restaurant. But then they\u2019re charging only 35-60% of the rates of the hotels located within a 5min walk radius who do offer all the above!!! So it really is your choice as to what you want to spend your money on. The rooms in Bill\u2019s are small-ish, clean and comfortable. I was slightly disappointed that our double bed seemed to be 2 singles pushed together underneath double-sized bedding so we had a slight ridge in the middle, but it was still very comfy. The rooms have a certain \u201cold time\u201d charm, with new world additions of air-con (which is needed!! Not the most up-to-date systems, though, so the units can be a bit noisy) and a 42\u201d plasma TV fitted unobtrusively onto the wall at the foot of the bed. Everything worked, and everything they promised would be in the room (shower/hair dryer/toiletries etc. etc.) was there. Check-in was dead quick and easy (tiny desk at the back of the casino) and we got the corner room overlooking the Strip that we\u2019d asked for. There was no safe in our room, but with security staff near the lifts to check room keys before you could go upstairs I wasn\u2019t too concerned about this \u2013 we always keep things like money and passports on us anyway. We were on the 4th floor and could hear no noise at night at all, with the exception of a bit of traffic going up/down the Strip. Not bad for getting a good night\u2019s kip in a city that never sleeps! The Victorian Rooms restaurant is not bad value at Vegas prices, but it isn\u2019t the best food on the planet. Lunches/dinners were better than the breakfast, which was perfectly edible but nothing special. The Steakhouse is supposed to be very good but we didn\u2019t get a chance to try it in the 4 nights we were there. Last word about Bill\u2019s - do go to the Lounge and see Big Elvis!! He\u2019s a legend on the Strip, and the best Elvis impersonator I\u2019ve ever heard (and with a sister who\u2019s an Elvis nut, I\u2019ve heard a few!!) \u2013 he plays late afternoon, which is a great time to just sit down for half hour (if you can get a seat!) with a cheap beer (we were getting new-style aluminium bottles of Bud for $2.25) and relax. Now for some general info/tips on Vegas itself: We went end of May and it was HOT!! The dryness of the air can come as a bit of a shock to a pale-faced Englishwoman like me \u2013 take plenty of sunscreen and moisturiser, as I couldn\u2019t believe how dry and itchy my skin went. We did the Grand Canyon helicopter trip, and I think it\u2019s something everyone should do!! By staying at Bill\u2019s instead of one of the \u201cbig boys\u201d you should save enough money to pay for it anyway!! We combined the helicopter trip with a 4x4 Hummer drive back over the Hoover Dam and an off-road desert track part of the way back to Vegas \u2013 the helicopter trip was brilliant, the Hummer trip just OK and probably not worth the money. Food and drink prices on the Strip aren\u2019t cheap by American standards, but aren\u2019t extortionate either. Surprisingly the best value, and impressive, breakfast was at the Bellagio \u2013 go to the buffet restaurant and, for $16, you get the largest buffet I\u2019ve ever seen!! You certainly won\u2019t need lunch after you\u2019ve stocked up on traditional eggs/bacon/pancakes, fresh fruit, various smoked fish, cereals, breads/pastries, Mexican breakfast burritos, Japanese teriyaki bar etc. etc.!! And, being the Bellagio, the quality of it is top notch. Don\u2019t miss the Bellagio fountains either \u2013 one of the few free attractions on the Strip and truly breathtaking!!! Word of warning, don\u2019t put off watching a show (normally every half hour from about midday onwards I think) to leave it nearer the end of your stay, especially if you are only there a few days. Vegas gets quite a bit of the desert winds coming through \u2013 nothing major, but anything over about 10mph and they stop the fountains running. The monorail system is very cheap and easy to use \u2013 we bought a special 2-day pass for about $13 each. Bally\u2019s is the best stop to use for Bill\u2019s \u2013 a 2min walk brings you out of the side entrance of Bally\u2019s where you can use the pedestrian crossing to get over the road and into the side entrance of Bill\u2019s. Using the Flamingo stop seems as if it will be just as close, but you have to walk through the entire casino complex to get out the front!!! The light canopy show in downtown Vegas at the Freemont St Experience is also well worth a visit one evening \u2013 don\u2019t go by bus, though, unless you have time to spare!!! Bus tickets are cheap ($2) but stop at EVERY stop up the Strip and the journey took about 50mins. Took a taxi back (cost about $15) and did it in under 15mins\u2026", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WA", "Title": "\u201cLoved our stay at Bill's Gamblin' Hall\u201d", "Author": "Liggs", "ReviewID": "UR16833797", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights at Bill's.

Our room was on one of the ends of the hotel on the 4th floor. You had to walk through some double doors to get to it. When we walked in, we were kinda intrigued by the big room. I guess it is considered a suite, with a sitting area. The bathroom and tub were huge and made of marble. The room felt like no one had stayed in it for a long time. I say that because the clock hadn't been changed to reflect daylight savings time. The furniture was very old but had character. If you have been to Elvis's home Graceland, then you will have an idea of the character of the room. We tried the tub, and the jets didn't work and the water wouldn't drain. The mattress was very very old and had me worried through the night. (I attached a pic of this room) We decided to move to another room and were were extremely satisfied. The room is done in great taste. The huge t.v. is awesome and the window in the shower was really great to peak out and let walkers on the strip know that I was naked up there. Got to see the Bellagio Fountains while I showered. I am not judging the hotel on the first night's stay because 99.9% of the rooms are not like that, and I actually loved the other room and the price that I was paying for Memorial day weekend. THE CASINO: we played slots and video poker throughout the casino and were are thoroughly convinced that the good paying slots and video poker machines are in the back near the Western Union window. We hit several big winning hands on VP in the back of the casino and the Wheel of Fortune video slots where also paying nicely through out the weekend. The newer machines in the front of the casino were very tight. For those that have been to Vegas before, they know that walking the strip can take it's toll on you, and the walk back to some of the rooms can be a challenge and tiring.

As other reviewers have noted, it's not the opulent luxury of Caesar's Palace, Bellagio, Venetian, or Wynn, but it's a hotel staffed by very friendly people who truly want you to have a pleasant experience. We were assigned a two-room suite on the north side of the building. You entered the room in a large sitting area with a wet bar, dining area, and 1/2 bathroom. The adjoining space was a large bedroom with its own full bathroom (with a window in the shower overlooking the pedestrian bridge to Caesar's) and a king bed. Both rooms had old CRT televisions.

It seems the hotel has recently upgraded a number of the slot machines (Ebay, Wizard of Oz, etc.) and a lot of people seemed to be excited about that. Drink service in the casino is swift and the waitresses are open to special drink requests. The bar in the back of the casino serves $1.50 Coors 24 hours per day. Rail drinks and beer are comped at the bars if you're playing the bar poker machines with at least $20. If you're playing a single credit, you're only supposed to get one drink, but that rule was only enforced on a crowded Friday night.

Bill's is on the same side of the street at MGM Grand, Harrah's, Imperial Palace, Casino Royale, Bally's, Venetian, and Palazzo. It's is located right at Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd, and between two Monorail stops -- the closer stop is actually the Harrah's/Imperial Palace station because it's the easiest walk through the hotel. The rooms are deep, but not very wide. The king bed easily fits in the room, and the 42\" plasma screen on the wall allows the room to feel bigger since you don't have a massive armoire when you walk in. But the rooms is so deep that there is some funky/wasted space towards the window, but it's a nice place to set your luggage, etc. YES, the bathroom is small, and at an odd angle in the room -- but the room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the hot water was plentiful. If you need a place to flop that's easy to get places from, then Bill's is the place to be. The casino is fairly small and cramped, and it tends to attract a lot of grizzled veteran gamblers that enjoy their cigarettes as much as their slot machines. I spent a total of 20 minutes playing there, and opted for the much nicer, comfortable settings of the mega-properties a short 5-min walk away. From Bill's you can hop the Deuce Bus (Route 301) along the Las Vegas strip. For $5, you get a 24-hr pass to ride it as much as you want. The Deuce runs from the Airport Rental Car center all of the way to Fremont Street -- certainly the best & cheapest way to get from the Strip to Fremont, though it is a bit slow since it makes NUMEROUS stops along the way.

In addition to the alarm there would periodically be an announcement that the alarm we just heard would be explained. It never was. Finally, my husband called the front desk and said we would be checking out and asked for a refund. Management did refund our money and we went to the Palazzo.

I was traveling with my cousin, both 50 somethings and first time visitors to Vegas. We had decided we didn't want to spend a fortune on a room we'd spend little time in - preferred to put our money into shows, etc. We wanted to be on the strip, preferably not at the end farthest from the airport (Bill's is about 3 1/2 miles from the airport). We wanted clean, safe, and comfortable. Bill's fit the bill perfectly! Our room was spotlessly clean. The flat screen TV was really nice, although we weren't really in the room enough to use it much. We never used room service so I can't comment on that. We ate in the Victorian Room - somewhat pricey, but comparable to others in the area and the food was good. All the money I won (and I did go home a small winner) was won at Bill's. We had a second floor room that overlooked the Flamingo. It was quiet - no disturbances from outdoors. I wondered at booking about noise from their after hours nightclub, but no problems there either. There is a security guard at the elevator and one on the floor. Even though the hotel was nearly full, we never even ran into other guests, much less any \"undesirables\". Still, their presence provided a nice sense of security. Bill's doesn't have a pool - not an issue for us on this trip - but guests are invited to use the Flamingo pool. With only a couple hundred rooms, check-in and check-out was a breeze. We visited all the hotels - one more beautiful than the next, but at certain times, their registration desks were backed up forever. And the sheer size of the big boys made it clear that getting to and from our room every day would have taken forever, first winding our way thru the casino and then waiting for the elevator. Bill's features an Elvis impersonator called \"Big Elvis\". He is big, but more impressive is his true-to-Elvis voice. We really enjoyed his show. If you're looking for an exclusive, glamorous, feeling like you're living in the lap of luxury hotel, skip Bill's.

It's a smaller than average Strip hotel with larger than average rooms, very clean, and very easy to navigate compared to the 2500+ room behemoths that line the rest of the Strip. Bill's location on the corner with Flamingo, Caesars, Bellagio and Bally's truly is center Strip. Although room decor is a bit Victorian frilly, there's a great flat panel TV to compensate. Bathrooms might be considered a bit small for couples, but for singles, it's quite adequate. The only thing missing in rooms is a comfortable lounging chair - there are four straight back dining-style chairs in the rooms. Because the property is located right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Flamingo, you're going to get some street noise. Here are some tips to minimize this problem if your ears are sensitive: --All rooms have a home-style thermostat, which you can set to have the fan run continuously. This does a great job of masking noise, and for people like me, the air rush actually induces sleep. In my stays at Bill's, the AC units provide \"quiet\" air rush with no accompanying hum, vibration or other motor noise. --Ask for an odd-numbered room. These rooms face the north and look out over the Flamingo, so the view isn't spectacular, but they are quieter than the even-numbered rooms, which face Bally's. (If view is more important than noise, these even numbered rooms do have an oblique view of the Bellagio fountains, and the view improves for rooms numbered x34 and lower.) When all other center Strip hotels are selling at $200, Bill's is at $70; when they're at $400, Bill's is at $150.

My husband and I visited some of the \"biggie\" hotels - Bally's, Mandalay Bay, Bellagio's, etc and in these places, even though you pay top dollar for the room rates relative to Bill's, there were long queues of hotel guests waiting to check in. By contrast, we did not have to wait to check in although it was full house at Bill's, and the receptionist very kindly switched us to a quiet non-smoking room on the 4th floor at our request. Highlight of our stay there was Big Elvis at Bill's Lounge who performed to a standing room only crowd that Mon afternoon I was there. This guy has had his contract extended through 3 management changes, and has become an attraction in his own right. Bill's has changed hands a couple of times in the last few years, and is now owned by Harrah's.

It was definitely worth it to be able to see the Bellagio fountains perfectly from the comfort of the room. The rooms are simple, decorated in a Victorian era style complete with stained glass window in the bathroom. The 42in plasma tv adds a nice modern touch though, and the beds and linens are comfortable and CLEAN. Nice crisp white sheets and good pillows all make for a very restful sleep. The bathroom I found to be a bit small, but with the sink separate from the shower/toilet you can make due. Casino is small but fun, mainly because the limits are lower than other casinos, and when people aren't losing the equivilant of their mortgage payment they seem in better spirits. Walk over to the Flamingo and sit at a $25 minimum Blackjack table and you'll know what I'm talking about. Crickets and tension....not my idea of fun. My only criticism of this hotel is the daytime front desk clerks. We only had one encounter with them during check-out (nighttime staff seemed fine) , and boy were they miserable, rude, etc!

Rooms are a little smallish and oddly shaped (with tiny bathrooms) but not terribly so and very clean (maid service was excellent); flat screen TVs are nice; you can get from room to Strip in, oh, two minutes; there are great views in some of the rooms; I really like the downtown-ish/rowdy-fun casino although some don't; I shot the bull with lots of staffers who seemed to like working there (always a good sign). A few dings, one serious, others not so much: --Rooms on the Flamingo Road side, especially as you get closer to the corner of the Strip (and I paid the $20 extra/night for a room with a good view) are VERY noisy. I am not a light sleeper and the noise was still very obvious and bothersome (lots of sirens in particular). The location has a lot to do with that but so do the windows in the bedroom area, which once slid open but now have been bolted shut (the bathroom window still opens). They appear to leak in a considerable amount of noise. The faux balcony design outside the windows also might help funnel in noise. Consider staying on the Flamingo Hotel side (no view) if this is at all an issue -- and I mean, *at all.* I think the windows on the Flamingo Road side of the hotel should be replaced at a bare minimum. The AC/heating unit is also fairly noisy, but it's a 'white noise' kind of thing that I found to be fine. --Carpeting in hotel hallway was very worn and needed to be replaced (carpeting in room was fine). --Price was really just OK against its competitors for the time I was there, but it probably varies during the year. Basic rooms at neighboring Bally's and the Flamingo were both only about $10/night more when I was there -- and of course, both places offer many more amenities (and also suffer from the down side of megaresort-ness). I've stayed at both hotels; Bally's rooms are substantially bigger, IMHO, and rooms at either hotel are likely to be much quieter.

No extra fee for the view rooms maybe because my sister-in-law had sent me a gorgeous fruit basket (ordered through flowersbytonilasvegas.com) so they knew it was a special day I guess.

Only complaint was the breakfast in Bills restaurant. I had ordered the scrambled eggs, with hash browns and toast and the eggs were dripping in butter or margarine. Took one bite and couldn't eat any more of the eggs. Below average comments from the rest of the group for their breakfasts which were sunny side up eggs, over easy eggs, soft boiled eggs and omelet.

Lots of hotels on the Strip are \"next\" to each other, but involve a 10+ minute walk, so Bills was ideal being next to Flamingo, across the road from Caesars etc. It's a small hotel for Vegas, but lively and the room was just like the photos - very comfortable, clean, big TV and quiet as we were at the back. I asked for a fridge (medical purposes) and was given one within 20 minutes of arrival. Bathroom had good shower, hairdryer, big mirror; plenty of drawer space, a table and dressing table - it was a fairly big room for the price. The view was the back of another hotel, but didn't matter to us as it was quiet and we weren't there much. There was one lift/elevator in the hotel, although it was never busy. Checking in/out was very easy and quick. A tip - booked a helicopter flight to the Grand Canyon and the bus picked us up right outside Bills, to take us to the airport. There are also lots of other trips that pick up at the hotel and shuttles to the Rio etc, direct from Bills. We ate at the Steakhouse a couple of times.

The slots are the tightest we found on the strip! They did have at least one $5 BJ table, but the payoff was 6:5 and finding a seat was impossible after about 11 AM. As far as rooms and rate - warning - if you want the BEST rate available, contact hotel by phone, not by website. We booked a month out via website and our rate was decent - $65 on Sunday, $75 Mon - Wed. Two days before we left for Vegas, I checked the website and they quoted a $49 rate for all 4 nights. When we checked in, I asked for the cheaper rate and was told that the \"hotel policy\" was that you had to pay the rate you booked on the website, but, if I had called to make reservations, they could charge the lower rate. So - because I had the foresight to book early and NOT tie up a reservation clerk to do so, I was penalized! I also found out this is Harrah's policy and one of the employees at Bill's agreed with me that it was ridiculous but he would get in trouble if he violated it. It may seem trivial, but it's the principle, not the cash. The room was pretty decent as Vegas rooms go. We were able to get a coffee pot simply by asking for it and at no charge. Internet access was $12.99 per 24 hour period. Wireless was available but slow; RJ cable available for a high-speed connection and it was very good. We had two queen beds - very comfortable and got extra pillows from housekeeping with no problem. The staff - all of them - were very friendly and helpful - not a bad one in the bunch! The room was cleaned promptly after we left and housekeeping was excellent. Of course, I always tip the housekeepers at least $3 a day, more if I want something special.

Beautiful dark wood everywhere (not PLASTIC molding like in The Venetian tourist trap), REAL stained glass windows everywhere, beautiful crystal fixtures. The real deal. Looking at my vacation pictures I realized this really is the most beautiful casino room left on the strip. Nothing compares to it's CLASSIC Victorian charms. Amazing that it was built in 1979. 3) Know that your really your staying at the best location in The Flamingo Resort. When staying at Bill's your walk to The Flamingo pool, taxi stand, showroom, casino and Margaritaville is MUCH MUCH MUCH shorter than if you are in one of The Flamingo towers.

Lots of chrome, glass, mirrors two bathrooms (that have seen better days). I was very surprised how well the rooms have held up over the years. Both bathrooms had stained glass windows that OPEN (fresh air is key in Vegas) and other than fire / police going by once in a great while - no real street noise. No flat screen but a cool set up with a rotating TV stand built into the bar - so you can spin in around depending on what side of the \"great room\" you are in (platform bed / dining table or living room / Marble Jacuzzi) The Jacuzzi is right to window - so while you enjoy yoru hot tub you can watch the Bellagio fountains).

The TV, as mentioned, was a 27\u201d tube, which looks small in today\u2019s world (but they are remodeling all the rooms with larger plasmas). The lighting was very dim, as the many track/recessed lights didn\u2019t help to really light up the room. There were 10 different light switches in the room, and the room was still dark with all of them on. Finally, the windows were VERY thin. We constantly heard the honking of cars from the strip.

Next to Flamingo, right by Bellegio, accross the street from Ceaser's! Everything is all around there in walking distance. GAMBLING: I think the best place to go is Flamingo..no matter what you are doing there is always a drink girl right there to order- Plus they would bring it pretty fast! Also, they are the only ones that has cheap rapid roulette, $2.50 min anywhere in the board...no restrictions. The drinks we're also really good there! Bill's was a nice smaller casino, everyday they had a \"cash blast\", when you sign up for the player card (free) you entered in a drawing where they pick 5 people to go in a money blower and you get to grab as much as you can. ROOM: We went thanksgiving week and we got the best rate imaginable...$49.95/night. It has a king size comfortable bed, very spacious, plasma TV, table & chairs, blow dryer, ice, dressers, body mirror, desk w/ mirror, vanity mirror seperate from toilet & shower, shower had beautiful flower design (see pic), balcony view (can't walk on it), all dark wood furnature that looked bran new, very clean! Was no way cramped like a holiday or days Inn. This place was up to par for that price. OVERALL: The service we received was very good, and it's one of those smaller places where you can get more of a personal touch. They had their own restaurants in there, special 14.95 for steak dinner. Also, when you sign up for the players card you get a coupon book. TIPS: (1) Super good show to see: CARROT TOP (at LUXOR) (2) PURE nightclub is worth waiting in line for (even though their drinks are expensive, $14 for a martini..ouch, then a long island & red bull/vodka was $26) It was all worth it though (3) Don't sign up for the player card on the weekend, try doing it on a Monday, because everyone seemed to be in the drawing on Sat/Sun when they first get there. If you were to wait for like a Monday, you have a better chance of getting into the cash blast (4) Think twice before seeing Penn & Teller...I heard alot of good things, but I paid $93 for 5th row ticket, and I expected more for that price. Of course they did some really cool things, but $93?? I wish I would have checked out Julibee (which was another reference I received) (5) Bus ride, be prepared to wait (if you have extra money, just take the taxi) avoid trolleys all together. (6) Avoid slots...if you were smart you would do this...you have more of a chance at the tables. Slots- you are seriously wasting your money. (7) At some places, you may want to order 2 drinks at a time, because alot of the time it's really busy. (8) Of course, bring good walking shoes- i tried to wear high heels and i almost died. i saved them strictly for the club.

This is a lovely hotel and we really liked the old Wild West feel to it. The rooms are spacious and very clean and it only took a few minutes to check in and only a few minutes to get to the rooms. I requested a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains but I would recommend asking for a room further away from the Strip as it can be quite noisy with the traffic and sirens. I was aware of this from other reviews on here so that was my fault. - and the fountains are much more spectacular from the pavement outside the Bellagio anyway. Bills location is excellent - right in the middle of the Strip and for the money you can't beat it. I've even recommended this hotel to my boss who is going to Vegas next year and there is no way I would do that if it was bad - I value my job too much lol. We ate in both restaurants and thought the Steakhouse was very nice with good service but the Victorian restaurant wasn't as good, it was just ok, however they were open 24 hours so it was convenient for a late dinner after a show. Hints n Tips: If you get a chance, see Big Elvis in the bar at Bills. It's a free show for an hour and he is very entertaining. They also have $1 Margarita's at the bar near the restaurants and the beers are cheaper here too but come in plastic cups. If you buy them from the main bar they are normal prices. Get a coupon for free entry to the classic cars at the Imperial Palace. They have some lovely cars on show. The views from the Paris hotel (up the 'Eiffel Tower') and the Stratosphere are very similar so you only really need to pay out for one. The rides at the Stratosphere are hair-raising but it's at the top end of the strip so if you don't intend on doing the rides they just opt for the Paris view and save yourself a few $. We thought the Venetian hotel was stunning and worth a visit. New York New York is a fun hotel and would have liked to have gone to the Coyote Ugly bar but sadly ran out of time. The Village Restaurant at the Paris hotel is great for a buffet breakfast at $15 and is in a nice setting. There were only 2 negatives at Bills that I could think of - the reception guy was a bit sourly and the windows were dirty -but obviously they were only minor ones.

The parking is free and it takes no time to get from your car to your room (unlike MGM and others that can take forever). In all, we had a god stay, with no complaints.

We wanted a hotel that was clean and in the centre of all the action. Bills is that and more. We stayed for 7 nights and the room size was perfect for that length of time. Bills is situated between Flamingo and Ballys with Bellagio and Rio just across the street. We took the $20 a night upgrade for a view of the fountains. We were put on the 4th floor (top floor) with a view of the fountains, Paris and Ballys. In my opinion the $20 was worth it but it all depends on how much time someone is going to spend in their room. The outside noise never bothered me. The only time I woke up was during the thunderstorm on our first night. I am fairly sensitive to smoke but our room was fresh and I found the casino smelt better than quite a few larger hotels too. The decor is very old fashioned but the rooms are very very clean and 42 inch tv is a nice feature. The kingsize bed was one of the most comfortable I had ever slept on. One massive advantage this hotel has got is there is not much of a walk to your room. The evalvators were situated to the left of the reception entrance. Most staff we came across were lovelly.

Rates were not so great either $149 and $199. Main problem I found was that even though the room was non-smoking it, and the rest of the hotel, seemed to smell of smoke. The casino especially I found particularly smokey. I couldn't stay in for more than 10 minutes and ended up going to another. Vistorian room for breakfast was a 20 minute wait followed by an average breakfast and then a struggle to get the check from the waitress who insisted I must want more coffee or water.

We paid an extra $20 over the above rates, in order to get this room which had a view, which allowed us to look down the Strip and watch the Bellagio fountains. The only drawback about the room was the traffic noise coming from the Strip (you may want to bring earplugs). The Big Elvis show in the lounge was fun. Also, we had a really nice meal at Bill's Steakhouse, and breakfast at the Victorian Room. This is a smaller, friendlier casino, and if you like table games, and aren't a high roller, the table limits are lower than the bigger casinos. We took the Craps 101 lesson at 10:30 am, and that provided a nice introduction to the game. There is no pool on site, but you have access to the pool at the Flamingo, a short walk right next door.

We were the only folks at the counter for both check-in and check-out although the hotel was booked. The room elevators are 20 steps from the front desk, which was a nice contrast to other casino hotel rooms. We checked in late and no Bellagio-view rooms were available but our room (number 415) still had a real nice view of the strip. We loved the larger than average room (450 sf as opposed to the standard 350 sf). The two queen beds were wonderfully plush and comfortable. The large-screen plasma TV was mounted on the wall above a nice large bureau. The bathroom was tucked away in the back and was divided into two areas, with the shower and toilet in one room and a sink and changing area in the other. Being a group of 4, this came in very handy! Shower pressure was just perfect. On the down side: we did put a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door, but I saw housekeeping knocking on everyone's door at 9a.m. to see if the room could be cleaned. Seemed a little early for Vegas. Staying at Bill's you can use the Flamingo pool next door... a large complex with 2 hot tubs, and several pool areas.

We found it to be an excellent hotel for the price, & would easily recommend Bill's to any potential guests. Although there are a lot of places to choose from when picking accommodation in Las Vegas, unless you have a ton of money, you might end up being stuck in the 'back section' of some of the nicer hotels. Don't let this happen to you - as with many Las Vegas hotels, the prices are cheap during the week, & in general, Bill's is a good compromise between classy & cheap. We arrived in the evening & easily found a park in the car parking garage next door (free). Check in was straightforward & we were also told that we had been upgraded for free (I think I may have asked before our arrival about getting a larger room if possible) - in fact we were upgraded to a suite. I imagine this to be a junior suite of sorts, knowing the type of luxury that some visitors stay in while in Vegas, but to us, it was really nice - we had a lounge room with a TV, leather couches, coffee table, dining table & cheairs, & a bar area (with fridge). There was a guest bathroom, as well as one for ourselves (which was on the small size considering the rest of the rooms, but we weren't complaining in the slightest). The main bedroom was large, with a massive bed, double wardrobe, safe, easy chair & TV. It was certainly luxurious compared to what we had been expecting, & compared to other places we have stayed in the past, as far as price was concerned. Bill's looked as if it had had a recent upgrade. There were several restaurants to choose from, including the Victorian Rooms where we ate several times - there were loads of people here who had come to eat from other casions, & it was open 24-hours. I don't think there was a pool at Bill's, but I felt as if the casino was about right for us. Many hotels don't have a casino but again, Bill's managed to find the middle-ground. If you are looking for a massive gaming floor & boutique stores then Bill's is not for you, but of course, these are all nearby. The gaming floor at Bill's was fairly small, but there was just enough of everything that you could have a decent time there. There was a stage for performances, several bars, & low-limit tables (some of the lowest in Vegas). It was also actually possible to get free drinks here, whereas other casinos apparently seemed to offer them but rarely actually came to take your order. The casino had a good feel about it & we preferred it over a lot of the other places. Located fairly mid-strip, it is opposite Caesar's Palace, & near the monorail & Bellagio's (with the fountain display). Most other casinos are a short walk or monorail ride away. There are also plenty of restaurants & small stores to shop in nearby on the strip, if you are after cheaper alcohol or tourist items. In general, we really enjoyed Bill's - it offered a taste of luxury without costing the earth, & is a well-presented, spacious mid-range Las Vegas hotel. The casino & restuarant were great for first-timers or older people who might not like the larger environments. My boyfriend & I would easily stay here again, & in fact, already talk of our next trip to Vegas, based on this hotel alone.

It's a rip - high prices for Denny's-like food. Go across the street to Caesar's or the Bellagio. Breakfast at the Victorian was good and reasonably priced.

I had read all the reviews on tripadvisor and for the $ it was worth it. Got there at 10am and was able to check in immediately. The check in process was a breeze and the girl was really nice. Was on the 4th floor(top floor) view of Bally's and the Bellagio water show everyday and night. The room was clean and spacious. King size,non-smoking, 42inch plasma tv, desk,table w/2 chairs,and nice bathroom w/all amenties(soap,shampoo,lotion,etc.). The room was done everyday w/no problem. The hotel was very clean. The casino/hotel had an old look to it like Victorian style. Which was nice. Ate at the Victorian restaurant 3 times and was very happy with their food. Had breakfast,lunch,and dinner. They also had a band playing a few days on the weekend. They were called, Freeride,and they were really good. They played all kinds of music. The drinks at the bars were good and inexpensive. Everyday they had small frozen margaritas for $.99 cents. So they were good and refreshing for them hot days. They also had a hotdog cart person selling a hotdog and beer for $3.00. that was a good bargain too if you wanted something quick. A rum and coke was $4.25 and a 16oz beer miller lite was $2.00. Never gambled at the casino, so was not sure how the machines were really. Security all over the hotel was great. Whenever we came in late at night, there was security by the elevator checking room keys. So that felt good and safe. Ice machines on every floor by the elevator, a/c was strong and cold. The best part of this hotel was the location. It was in the heart of the main strip. You had Bally's on one side,Bellagio on the other, Flamingo next door,and Ceasars across the street. You can't beat the location. Why pay sooo much $ for a fancy hotel that you are literally going to sleep and shower at. We were only in the room late at night to sleep in and left early the next morning. I highly recommend Bill's and there staff was really great! Polite and courteous from the front desk staff to the bell hop guy to the maids,etc. The only thing that I suggest that was a con was no safe in the room and a mini refridge. The safe was the most important thing. I had never been to a hotel w/out a safe. If you want a safe you have to rent one in the lobby in a cage like and its $60 refundable. But, who wants to keep going there to get some $. So, that was the only complaint,other than taht we did fine. A samll fridge is good so when you are thirsty you can have something cold to drink. But, I would recommend this place to anyone on a budget or just for a nice clean place. Another thing is that I liked about this hotel was,when reading all the tripadvisor reviews,people complained about these huge hotels and the wait for the elevators. Bill's had 2 elevators,4 floors and they came by quick all the time....no major waiting. Also, the front side that I stayed in can get a bit noisy,which some reviewers put in, that is true.

Bill's patrons can use the Flamingo pool next door. It is a very easy walk -- in fact, my friends staying at Flamingo joked that the pool was closer for me than for them. The garage is extremely easy access (again, very unusual for Las Vegas) - bankrupting the valet. This is not a fancy hotel at all. But, the location is unbeatable. I walked all over the strip and loved having the central location and manageable hotel size. There's a Seattle's Best Coffee bar downstairs -- as well as a dumpy coffee shop and the most popular after-hours club in Vegas (Drai's). Service was very friendly - but, I didn't need much help. I was very pleased with security checking for keys at the elevators. There is noise from the strip and street. I was on the top floor looking at the Flamingo entrance on LV Blvd. It was noisy, but tolerable. I brought ear plugs, but didn't need them.

The problem some mentioned with noise in the hall I do agree. I think why that is is that most hotels have the bathroom right when you walk into the room so there is a buffer, Bill's has the bathroom on the outside wall. The only complaint I have at all with the room would be the shower head is too low, I am 6 foot and it was about eye level. One of the best things is the size. I can get from my room and thru the casino in no time. After playing poker all night at the Flamingo the last thing I wanted was a long walk thru a casino to get to my room. I was closer to the poker tables than if I had booked at the Flamingo. I was able to check in at 1230 so that was a great plus. Any staff I came in contact with was very friendly.

You're about the same distance from the very north end as you are the south. Pretty much everything is going on within 2 blocks on either direction of where Bill's is. If you want to be on the strip, I suggest you go here. It's not big, fancy, or have a theme like the other casinos on the strip, but it is a small, more quiet, and a nice place to stay for 1/3 of the money that the casino right across the street charges. I paid $70 dollars a night for 4 nights. That's $280 and will get you one night in the Bellagio which you are a half of block from. All you are doing is sleeping and showering in your room. I might add that this room was just a normal king as in any hotel and was very nice. It had a 42\" T.V, a cherry wood \"i believe\" headboard, very comfortable bed, nice wood trim throughout the room, nice shower, sink, toilet, with instant hot water, and the room was always clean no matter what time we left it was clean when we got back with fresh linens. If you're room means everything to you and you're not going to leave it, I'd still stay here over the Bellagio, MGM, Caesars, you name it. I stay in hotels every other day for my job, and this is a nice hotel for what you do in a hotel. There are 2 restaurants that are very good, and plenty of slots and table games to choose from. Security stands post at the elevators after 7 to make sure you're a guest going \"up.\" I never lost any sleep. I often stay in hotels in big cities right downtown. Bill's was more quiet than what I'm used to. Check in was about 3 minutes and checkout was about 1 minute. Waited about 3 minutes for a cab at 8 am when none were around. The bellhop saw me and came right out and got one for me. There are bus station all over the strip that take you downtown or on down the strip for $2. If you want to go \"see\" the big casino's/hotels, just walk there. You have to leave your room to go see them anyway even if you were staying there, so why not get a nice, cheaper room and just go visit them? Caesars, Ballys, Flamingo, Paris, Bellagio, are all a stones throw away. Venetian, Mirage are about a 15 minute walk....with the crowd, and the Rio is directly in front about 2 blocks. Bottom line, if you want the strip, but don't want the $200-400/night strip price, go to Bills.

But there is room for a couch, coffee table, you could probably even fit a ping pong table in there. But instead there is just lots of empty space that makes the room look incomplete.

There were two incidents of loud and drunken guests being escorted out of the place by security. And the guy next to me at the craps table was warned several times about shouting curses on every roll he missed. The pit bosses and security were on top of the situation but it seemed like a disproportinate amount of bad behavior at what is usually a slow time on the casino floor.

My room was ready, and exactly as I had asked for it with 2 queen beds. The rooms were spacious and clean. The plasma tv was large. The bathroom had a nice set-up, especially for 3 females, as the toilet and shower were in a private area, and the sink had it's own private area. Both locations with doors you can close off from the rest of the room. The tub/shower was a good enough size for me, and having a window in there that you can open is great for letting out the steam or other fumes before the next person uses it. The beds are very comfy, and the maid service did not bother you if you had your do not disturb sign out. We always removed the sign once we would leave out for the day, and would always return to a clean room. At one point, they did not restock the washclothes, only towels and handtowels. And when I requested more, they sent up more handtowels. This was minor, but was a little strange. Maybe they ran out of washclothes. Anyway, I have no complaints about the room or the hotel. There is security at the elevator, that checks for your room key at night. The casino was small, but not being an avid gambler, it was perfect for me.

We stayed at three hotels during our week the first being Barbary Coast. This hotel was great for the price we paid as we wanted cheap for the beginning of our trip before we got married. It was around $65US/night. Located across from Caesar's right in the heart of the strip it is a perfect base for exploring Las Vegas Blvd. When we checked in we were upgraded to a suite. Not sure why, but we weren't complaining. The room was large with seperate living area with 27\" TV (bedroom also had 27\" TV neither plasma, unfortunately), two bathrooms and a bar. My husband's family also stayed at Barbary for the same price in regular rooms so we also saw those rooms. They were just fine and they had plasma TV's. The rooms are very clean and quiet as we were on the first floor directly above the casino I thought it would be noisy. We never tried the restaurants, but there is a really friendly Italian restaurant right behind the Flamingo (next door to Barbary) that is fantastic. Can't remember what it is called, but it starts with a \"B\". Our first night we went to the casino bar for a couple drinks and decided to play the slots. I was able to play for over an hour on $5 and I got a bit drunk as they gave us free drinks while we played. Great first night. If you don't plan on spending much time in your room, and who does in Vegas, Barbary Coast is a great buy. We also liked how small the hotel/casino is. After walking through the mega Casino/Hotels, coming back to the Barbary was a relief. My husband and I hope it is still standing the next time we visit as we both agree we would be happy to stay here again. We also stayed at Bellagio and the Venetian and although Barbary doesn't hold a candle to Bellagio, I would choose it over Venetian.

Having been to Vegas and walking by the Barbary Coast, it wasn't even a consideration when planning, but a friend of ours that was to meet us there suggested it. After reading all of the positive reviews, I reluctantly agreed and booked our room. Boy, am I glad we did. I am a bit of a hotel snob, a room has to be absolutely clean. I take my ever present container of Lysol Disinfectant wipes with me on EVERY trip. I wipe down the toilets, counter tops, remote controls, doorknobs....you name it, I clean it. Each and every surface I cleaned, the wipe came up just as white as before. I can't say that about some other higher priced hotels. The rooms where fairly good size, the toilet is in a separate room with the tub/shower, so you aren't holding up anyone from using the sink/vanity area. The beds where VERY comfortable. And the plasma TV hanging on the wall is a beautiful thing. We never heard a sound from any of the other rooms or from the hallway, even though the hotel was booked solid when we were there. One morning my husband ordered room service. We had waffles w/fresh sliced strawberries and cream. YUUUMMMM!! The cream was real whipped cream, not that mess in a plastic tub. They told us it would be brought up to the room in 35 mins. It only took about 20 mins. QUICK! The casino is small compared to the other mammoth casinos, but it is nice and cozy. Every employee we encountered was very nice and knowledgeable. We asked for a good \"locals\" place to eat breakfast one morning and was sent to a great little place. And according to Mike the wonderful bellman that has been there for 22 years, Harrah's bought Barbary the same week that an investment firm out of Texas bought Harrah's, so it will be years before they can do anything to this hotel. This investment firm does not have its gaming license and since it takes years and years to get it, they can't touch the hotels/casinos. I was very surprised by this hotel. On the outside, it looks dated and in need of some TLC, but on the inside, its warm, cozy and very nice. Barbary Coast is home to a 4 diamond rated restaurant (sadly, we didn't take advantage of it) and one of the hottest after hours bar around. Who Knew??? I really liked the fact that after dark, you had to show your room key to a security guard to get on the elevators. I would definitely stay there again. We highly recommend this hotel.

We had chosen the BC based on the reviews of this website and were not disappointed! Check-in was quick and easy as was finding our room. Unlike the huge mega-resorts, we did not have to wander around the hallways looking for our room. We had read that noise might be a problem and since we had a room on the 2nd floor, there was some concern. But, we did not have any problem for 4 of the 5 nights we were there. The exception was Friday night when there seemed to be a lot of sirens, etc. But it never really bothered us all night. We had a partial view of the fountains and the strip but our room was a little far back but we liked it! We also liked the fact that security asked for a room key after 7:00 at night to anyone wanting to go to a room, makes you feel a little safer! There were also a lot of security in the casino itself, I suppose because there are so many people at the tables. The rooms were exceptionally clean, we thought that might wear off after a few days, but our room was just as clean the first day to the last. The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly and they don't make you feel like they are waiting for a tip just by giving you directions. We especially liked the casino which is on the smaller side but always lots of people, especially at the tables. If you go out the side door which faces Bally's, you can catch the shuttle which will take you to the other Coast properties and you can get a taxi there also. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes but we never waited that long, they seemed to always be pulling up. The other properties seem just as nice but the Sun Coast was definately for the geriatic crowd. We did not eat at the BC, as the Victorian Room was always crowded. But, as was also recommended on this website, we tried the Paris Buffet. It was incredible and I would recommend that buffet highly! We will definately stay at the BC again next year and would recommend it to everyone, it is an excellent hotel!

My girlfriend and I stayed there for four days in the middle of December because of the reviews and enjoyed every minute. We checked in around 6 PM on Tuesday. There was no wait at the reception and hardly a walk to the room. The airline lost one of our bags, and when it finally arrived, the Bell Captain delivered the missing bag to our room around 11 PM. Good service! The room is just like the picture on the website. The bed and pillows are very comfortable for those that like a firm but soft mattress (I think the mattress was a pillow top). The pillows are the kind you can fold in half and it will still contour to your head. We had a 2nd floor view of the Bellagio fountains. The only noticeable noise was from the sirens on the strip and an occasional tour bus, but didn't bother either of us. The window that opens in the bathroom is a very nice feature. It's great for letting out steam from the shower or smoke if only one person is a smoker in the room. As with the Orleans, the amenities were good; they provided lotion, face soap, body soap, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The plasma TV is nice (though it is not high definition). The casino is small with limited seating for the lower limit tables during the busy times. If you like the Sports Book action, you could find much worse. We never had a problem finding seats, like in some of the better known sports books. We had an unobstructed view during the NFL games of the aged 56\u201d (estimated) projection screen in the lounge and the multiple 32\u201d (estimated) screens in the betting area. We received free drink coupons for placing a wager. We enjoyed good food and service both times at the Victorian Room. If they are busy, they will call your name in the casino when your seat is ready. Everyone was very friendly and housekeeping was exceptional. No matter when we left the room, within an hour, the room was clean. Also, expect a gentle wake-up warning knock from housekeeping around 10:00 every morning, which wasn\u2019t so exceptional.

The AC was old and really loud, but still works. Our room eventhou was facing the strip, we can hardly see the water show across the street at Bellagio. That's the only reason I requested a room facing the strip. I should have picked one not facing the strip, at least it won't be so noisy at night. Noises are mostly from motocycles.

We had room 410 - a King Non-Smoking room overlooking the strip - awesome view of the Paris Hotel and Eiffel tower, Ballys, and most awesome we had a straight shot view of the Bellagio Fountains! It can be loud with the street noise but we used the fan feature on our heating/AC unit to create a nice humm in the room while sleeping and it blocked out ALL of the street noise. The room was very large and roomy, the linens they use are top quality, beds were high quality too, the rooms were fantastically clean and nice, the 42\" plasma flat screen tv hanging on the wall (while we didn't use it much) was great, the bath products in the room were top-notch too. Housekeeping was very effective and very friendly, the front desk staff are pretty rude and unhelpful and the casino is dark, dingy and the smokiest of anywhere we went. The nice thing though is you can get from the front door of the hotel into your room in less than 30 seconds and once in your room, you are in your own nice little oasis! Loved the stained glass window in the shower that actually opened to let in some fresh air and let out steam. Heard a rumor that they are going to tear down BC, Flamingo, Imperial Palace and Harrah's but upon asking the front desk staff they said that Harrah's had bought all of the hotels/casinos but no plans to tear anything down yet. Recommend gambling at the Flamingo next door (slots pay out well and frequently and the free drinks are plentiful even if you are playing only the penny slots) or taking the Deuce Bus ($5 for 24-hour unlimited pass- works great and runs the entire length of the strip both directions) down to Riveria (they pay out pretty good and they have a restaurant that has over 35 selections for 99 cents including margaritas and beer! Good quality stuff, very yummy and cheap!) and Binions at Fremont Street has an awesome steak and lobster dinner for $10.95 - big meal and really great service and food quality.

We were treated like guests where the staff went out of there way to accommodate us and seemed to care about their hotel. The rooms were clean. The beds were so comfy. The bathroom including the shower was perfect. Some folks reported the showers as being too small but they were just right for me and I am a tallish woman.

The Victorian Room restaurant, which was lovely with its pointsettia decorated Christmas tree surrounded by the red velvet decorator touches once again served up tasty food. Nothing fancy just good old-fashioned American cuisine. Location is a plus as Bally's and Paris are across the street. The Flamingo is next door and Bellagio is not that far either.

We are already planning another trip within the next month or so as we enjoyed our stay at the Barbary Coast.", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "Candleuk", "ReviewID": "UR6476697", "Content": "We stayed at the Barbary Coast for 10 nights from the 8th Dec 06, we did a lot of research on here before booking and what everybody has written is true. The location could not be better, it is smack bang in the middle of the strip, it is in-between the Flamingo and Ballys, only a minute or so to the Paris casino which does an amazing buffet. We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon and were checked in and up in our room within 5 mins of arriving. The elevators are next to reception which in turn is next to the main entrance so no dragging your cases through the casino. we had requested a room with a view of the fountains across the road when we booked 3 months earlier and that is what we got. We were in room 216 on the 2nd floor, see the photos for the view and some room samples. We found the room very clean and they serviced the room every day, the maid never bothered us when we had the do not disturb card on the door but we could hear her knocking on other doors. The room was quite large and as people have mentioned the 42\" TV on the wall was a bonus. They gave us clean towels daily and they provide plenty of free shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, soap and a hair dryer. Plenty of draw space for the clothes but no wardrobe as such. You go into the bathroom which is split into 2 rooms, in the 1st room you have a wash basin, mirror etc. and then at one end of this room is a ironing board and a pole that runs between the walls with hangers on and a shelf above. It was different but actually worked quite well. At the other end of this room was a door leading to the bath, shower and toilet. This layout worked well as while one person was in the shower someone else can shave or brush teeth. The bed was massive and extremely comfy, probably one of the best beds I have ever slept in, luckily they also provide an alarm clock. The main road outside was always busy and the noise at night from the traffic was loud, I have stayed in New York a couple of times but it was much worse in Vegas. I am lucky in that I can sleep through anything but if you have trouble just take some earplugs as the view on that side of the hotel more than makes up for the noise. There is no safe in the room but you can use a safe deposit box at the casino cage, we had to give a $60 deposit for the key in case we lost it but this was returned when we checked out. the casino cage is open 24hrs so you always have access to the box. The elevators were quick and we never had to wait very long, they have an ice machine on every floor by the elevators and a soda machine on the 1st and 3rd floors. At night a security guard will ask you for your room key when trying to use the elevator to get back to your room which was nice. We never felt unsafe walking up and down the strip and never came across any trouble. They have a little gift shop which also sells crisps (chips) and sweets. We had a meal in the Victoria Rooms in the hotel a couple of times and it was fine, it is open 24hrs so you can eat at anytime. We had to wait 20 mins or so before a table was free as we didn't book but they announce it over a loud speaker system so you can go and get a beer at the bar or have a gamble while you wait. Alcoholic drinks are brought in by a waitress and paid for separate to your meal for some reason. A beer at the bar in the casino was between $2 to $3 depending which beer you had when you are not playing on a machine, they only did half pints for some reason which seems to be a bit of a theme in many of the casinos. If you are playing a machine which is set into the bar then the beer is free. I am not much of a gambler but all the staff are very very friendly from reception to the pit staff. We tried roulette for the 1st time ever and they made it easy for us. They offer free craps lessons daily if you want to learn. The slots start at 1 cent a go so you don't have to go mad. They had entertainment daily from Fat Elvis in the afternoon to a live band in the evening. They have a coffee shop in the far corner of the casino which was very nice and not badly priced, we would have liked a coffee machine of some sort in the room for 1st thing in the morning when we woke up and to be honest the lack of the coffee machine is the only bad thing I can say about this hotel which when it comes down to it is nothing at all to worry about. I had never been to Vegas before and I loved it, when I go back and I will the Barbary Coast will be my 1st choice every time.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience!\u201d", "Author": "Rach212", "ReviewID": "UR6452080", "Content": "The wonderful reviews on this website are all true.

Our room #110 (on the 1st room floor) faced the Bellagio Fountains - which is the direction we requested. It was, however, noisy - being on what is really the 3rd floor -as there are 2 floors are parking above the Casino and below the 1st floor of rooms. Our room was fine - but on day 1 for eg. there were two water glasses, day 2, one water glass, day 3 no water glasses. Shamposs etc. were not repleished on any day - and were of a Motel 6 quality. The bath was clean - but we did notice mould on the tiles. The room was clean - but given the cold weather, we were surpirsed there were no blankets, and the heating system (a fan system linked to the air condfitioner was very noisy). The Plasma or LCD screen is a nice touch - but rarely used. As we had coats (it was cold) we needed to hang them - but no closets, or room safes. Bottom line is that room is basic - do not expect a 4* or even a nice 3*. What is great about the Barbary is: (1) location, location, location, (2) ambience - loads of it, (3) the small size makes it comfy - the Casino being small enough so you feel at home after a day or so and (4) car self parking was a breeze, so very convenient (valet is also available) and 2 minutes from self parking to walk to your room - need we say more? We had the \"famous\" hotdogs - which were OK - but nothing special. Service in the hotel is very good, and staff are great, We did not eat in the hotel, despite trying twice - but the regular restaurant (Michaels?) had a 40 minute wait - so we went elsewhere. Would we stay again? - we have thought about it and if we visit in the fall/winter we would stay at the Barbary as we do not need outdoor amenities. But for the summer/spring - will stay in a place with a large pool area, loads of resturants and bars etc. We have stayed at the Orleans, MGM etc. so do know what our options are.

My wife and I got a room on the top floor (4th so you can tell how small it is) with a view overlooking the Bellagio fountains. This was an added bonus as both our friends had rooms on the other side of the hotel looking out on the top of the car park. The positioning is great as you are on one of the busiest cross roads with Paris, Ceasars, Ballys and Belliago all within 5 minutes walk. The atmosphere of the hotel is great compared to the hussle of the bigger ones you actually feel like you get a personal service which makes a change in Vegas. There were only two very very minor problems, but they are worth mentioning. Firstly the shower head is set very low in the bathroom, so if you are slightly too tall you can hit your head on it. Secondly though the view was good the windows are not overly sound proof so you can hear all the traffic and noise from the strip.

We chose to stay at the Barbary Coast after reading reviews of it (and other hotels) on this site and found the reviews to be entirely representative of what we found. A comfortable small 200 bedroom hotel right at the centre of the strip, ideally placed for sight seeing. Our room was large and comfortable. (The bed was amazing!) As other reviewers have pointed out, the rooms do smell a bit smokey but not to any degree that we were put off. Our room as with all rooms on our side of the hotel have a view of the Bellagio fountains which are an awesome sight. We managed to catch most of the shows whilst we were there. Unlike other reviewers however, we did not find any problem with outside noise at all during our stay and we were on the noisy side apparently! The bathroom is small and outdated, but clean and functional. The bath is teeny. I just managed to fit in it and I am 5'2\" so husband had no chance at 6'1\"!!! The showerhead is also low as someone else pointed out, but it's not insurmountable and we got on fine with the facilities available. The only thing we didn't like was the closet area being inside the bathroom area, and the only place to hang clothes. There is more than enough room inside the room for an additional wardrobe. An expensive dress I had with me for my birthday dinner was ruined whilst hanging here - we can only assume by housekeeping but are confident that it was accidental. The hotel were very quick and accommodating and sent officers up to investigate and take photos, and have promised to resolve the matter as quickly as possible with us. We are waiting to here from them but have every faith that they will. Arrival and departure were swift and hassle-free. No queuing. The bellman, Mike, was tremendously helpful during our stay. The casino is small and old-fashioned looking, this gave the hotel an unique character, certainly amongst the strip hotels and it's small size seemed manageable rather than overwhelming as some of the larger hotel resorts. The Seattle Coffee Shop inside the hotel has fantastic coffee, tea and cakes. Avoid the Victorian Room at all costs - awful and greasy - there are plenty of other places to eat in other hotels which are far better.

Our room overlooked the Bellagio fountains and although there was some noise from the strip at night, we were usually so tired it didn't really bother us - anyway, the air conditioning drowned it out! We picked the Barbary because there had been so many good reviews and we were not disappointed. The location is really good and you are close to all the action. We stayed at the Luxor last year which we found to be a bit far out, especially if you're relying on the bus to get around. It was also also nice not to have a 10 mile trek to get to your room. We went to the Victorian Room a couple of times for breakfast and this was ok but we found the Sidewalk Cafe next door at Ballys was much better - it certainly filled us up for the day! We didn't try the other restaurants (Michaels & Drais) but they have good reviews. The hotel also had plenty of entertainment in the form of Big Elvis most afternoons and they also had \"lounge bands\" in the evening. The drinks were reasonably priced and during the day there is a hot dog stand in the hotel which only costs $1.25. I'm pretty fussy when it comes to food but it wasn't bad at all. The rates are so much lower than the bigger hotels and although it doesn't look as grand the table limits are lower, which is probably good for beginners. They also have free craps lessons every day at 10.30. If you want to see a show then try the half price ticket booths. They are situated in Fremont Street, the Fashion Show Mall and at the Hawiain shops up from Aladdin. Tickets go on sale at 11.00 for shows that night and there are some bargains to be had. Be prepared to queue but you will save a hell of a lot of money. The Fashion Show Mall is good for shopping but so are the shops in Aladdin & the Venetian and you should definitely look around the Forum Shops at Ceasars just for the fantastic ceiling!

And getting to your room is easy. Our room was small, but very adequate. It was clean, and the 42 inch plasma gave it a feel of a much more expensive room. The only down side was that it was pretty loud. If street noise (lots of sirens) keep you up, the BC may not be for you. The gambling was pretty good. Double deck blackjack for five bucks a hand. Tables were usually available. On Friday nights the after hours club still had a line at 6:00 AM. There was no pool at the BC, but that allowed my wife and I to attempt to sneak into some of the better pools in Vegas. Successfully. Best of all, the BC has one of the best locations on the strip.

The room was a little on the small side, but when your in Vegas what do you need a gigantic room for??? it was fine for us! and the 42\" flat Panel TV was a neat touch and since i was hanging on the wall it didn't take up any extra space. The room was very clean, and since my dad smokes i booked a smoking room but it didn't smell of smoke at all. the beds were way too comfortable I almost didn't want to get out of bed. The shower was clean, but the shower head was mounted a little low for me, had to crouch down to wash my hair, lol. and i am only 5'10\" but it wasn't bad and they gave you Shampoo, conditioner, Body wash, hand lotion, and body scrub bar. which was nice. We never got up early, and usually headed out around noon or 1:00pm but the room was always cleaned and made up while we were out, so we always had made beds and fresh towels when we came back in the wee hours of the morning. I am going again in December and am definately booking the barbary. I reccomend booking early as they sell out fast only having 200 rooms and a few of those are Suites. but the entire trip for me and my dad was less arounf $700 that included round trip airfare from BWI to LAS and back and the four nights hotel accomodations.

The hotel is one of the smallest along the strip next door to the Flamingo Hotel. The check- in service was quick and we were swiftly taken upstairs to our rooms by the bell man who again decided to tell us about all the things to see and do in Vegas. I think we were getting the picture!!! The room had large queen sized beds and a plasma screen TV. We were pleased with our choice and liked the fact that everything was so conveniently located. We were on the 1st floor of the hotel and was able to nip downstairs without too much fuss. We used the hotel restaurant which was ok. However all of the hotels had an open door service so you could go into the hotel restaurants and be served. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast at the Hotel Flamingo for $15 you could eat a hearty meal it was fantastic. Having the casino within the hotel meant that there was so many people coming and going and you felt slightly alienated from the staff working in the hotel you kind of lost track of who worked there. however most staff were courteous. For the cost of the rooms I think it was good value for money. Although be sure to change your travellers cheques into dollars if wanting to settle your hotel bill and also be aware that you will need to bring the credit card used to book the room as this hotel was the only one which requested that you pay for one nights stay as part of the deposit.

The restaurant is reasonably priced. Also, the hotel gives you a coupon book which includes a free drink at their cocktail bar. I had the most delicious virgin strawberry daiquiri! The Barbary Coast has a free shuttle to other hotels that are owned by the same company that owns Barbary Coast.

What's not to like? I was in Las Vegas Aug 13-19 with my boyfriend, he was there for the letter carriers union convention. We originally planned to stay at the Stratosphere. When I realized I would be spending my days alone while he was in the convention I decided to change our reservations to a more central location. I am very glad I did. The Barbary Coast is in the center of everything! It is a small hotel and casino, especially in comparison to the giants nearby like Ceasars and Bellagio. Barbary Coast couldn't be in a better location. It is next door to the Flamingo. It is located on the same corner with Bally's, Ceasar's Palace and Bellagio. We arrived at the Barbary Coast at 2am and I was afraid we would get a crappy room. Our room was great. I called ahead to say we would be arriving late and that we wanted a King room. Our room was very nice. The king bed was very comfortable. The linens were soft and wonderful. All the rooms have been recently spruced up. The furniture was rich looking, crown molding all around, carpet and wallpaper new. I know the furniture was new because there was still some plastic on the chairs. Our view was good, except for that bothersome Bally's sign. The Eiffel tower at Paris was right outside the window. The fountains at Bellagio would have been in plain view if not for the Bally's sign. I could still see everything except the center of the fountain display. Yes, you could hear the street traffic outside. It didn't bother either of us at all. The room was clean and comfortable and quite large. The bathroom was a bit small, but also clean. The tub/shower had a lovely stained glass window that could be opened. There was ample storage space, a desk with internet access, and a table and chairs. The 42 inch plasma TV was a real hit! The hotel staff was wonderful, especially the bellman who arranged my tour to Hoover Dam and our shuttle back to the airport. The room staff was also great. Our room did not have a coffee maker, but I think if you ask for one you can get it. We ate at the Victoria room a couple of times, it's open 24 hours. I had the prime rib special for $13.95. it was excellent. The breakfast was also good, cheap and fast. They gave us some coupon books when we checked in that had some good stuff in it. You can get another coupon book if you sign up for the Coast Club Casino card. I took the hotel shuttle to the Orleans one day to go to the pool. I got another coupon book there with more free stuff. All the drinks are $2 all the time. If you are gambling they are free. The entertainment in the lounge was good. I enjoyed the bartenders at Harrah's Carnival Court. You must have the breakfast buffet at Paris. You have to stroll the Venetian and Ceasars. Buy the 24 hour pass if you ride the Deuce to downtown because you will want to use it the next day to go to MGM, New York, New, York, etc. See the dancing fountains several times at the Bellagio up close where you can hear the music. It's a different show every time. The pirate show at TI is crowded and hard to get a good view. The volcano at MIrage is worth seeing. I rode the roller coaster at NY NY and loved it, but I'm not sure it's worth $12.50. We saw Tom Jones, He was AWESOME!!!! There are live flamingo's at the Flamingo and lions at the MGM.

Also, the restaurant is really good! Cons: There is only the one restaurant, as opposed to the bigger hotels that have tons of eating options. But it is so centrally located that you can get to wherever you want to go easily. Also the casino is not the best. It is kind of old school--like what you would find on Fremont Street. A little cramped, etc. So unlike the bigger hotels, it is not a place to just stay for three days and never leave. However, I now find that to be a plus after the MGM experience.

I did not hear the massive noise that others have referenced, but then again, by the time we went to sleep, we were usually beyond exhausted. To make our bargain even more delightful, a friend of ours meet us in Vegas and stayed at Treasure Island. She paid almost $60 more a night and to be honest, the only thing she had on us was a just slightly larger bathroom. Definitely not enough to warrant $60. In addition, we had views of Bally's, Paris and Bellagio, she had views of parking garages. It's also worth noting that we won more at Barbary Coast than at the other casinos we played in. Try the big wheel of fortune penny slots in the front of the casino. We won $80 and saw others win upwards of $400.

We didn't pay much for this room in comparison to other showy hotels on the strip (about $100/night), so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly suprised. We had a great stay for 4 nights and got married while we were there. The Barbary is a tiny hotel next to neighboring giants, but that can actually be a good thing when travelling with a group of people that are staying in various hotels. If you want to meet up, all you have to say is come to the Barbary, no questions asked. You don't have to direct through mazes of slots, tables, fanciful lobbies, multiple escalators or what have you that has become Vegas these days. Beleive me, if you want that you can go to any of the surrounding hotels for a visit and you'll get your fill. The rooms were also very nice. We had a king sized bed, decorations were upscale and tasteful. Plasma TV was a bonus. The room was clean and housekeeping was excellent. Only they were almost too on top of things, coming around at 8:30am, you could hear them knocking several doors before and after yours. \"Houskeeping\" tap tap tap. The do not disturb sign doesnt help too much. Come on, this is Vegas I don't go to bed until 5am, thats prime sleeping time. The a view of the Ballagio fountains was nice aside from the giant Bally's billboard. My only other warning to those of you wanting peace and quiet, its pretty loud on the strip/Flamingo Ave. facing side, with all of the traffic noise, ambulances, hot rodders and not to mention the Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin and Dean Martin coming from next door (I think it was that giant billboard). You will have that music stuck in your head for days after you come back home. All part of the Vegas experience! There's no pool but if you know anyone staying somewhere with a pool all you need is one room key and everyone can get in without any hassle. One side comment, Jubilee, the topless review at Bally's right next door was such a great show. Go there, its only $50, the best entertainment you'll see in Vegas and it was done in such taste. Back to the hotel, one other extremely handy feature of the Barbary for us was the roomservice. It was really affordable considering you usually shell out for a dissapointing buffet or eat crappy fast food. For your time, money and your poor aching feet, roomservice is the way to go. They also deliver liquor which is the smart thing to do if you are trying to save some money. The food was really pretty good too. There is also a real liquor store if you walk east a block down Flamingo Ave. The best bet for getting free drinks in the hotel is to sit at the bar and play video poker. Drinks are free if youre playing reguardless of how slow you play and they keep em coming at the bar, just tip them to keep them happy. All of the folks working at the hotel were really friendly and extremely helpful. Especially the bell hop, even if you call from you're room. One other tip, if you are looking to find a taxi, go to Bally's. There is an actual cross walk, thats right you will be walking on the street, on the south side of the hotel that will take you right over there to a whole line of waiting taxis. Barbary does not get this kind of taxi service because they are such a small hotel. WARNING!!!!!: Never get into an unmarked taxi. On our way to the airport while toting luggage over to Bally's to get a taxi ($12 by the way), my new hubby was chatting on his cell, we were grumpy and tired and ready to vacate Vegas for a long time, when this man approached me. His car was pulled up backwards to the curb just down from where the taxis usually are, with his trunk open. He asks me if we need a taxi and starts to grab for my bags. Luckily Im still holding on to them. As I check out his car I notice it is not labeled as a taxi would be in any way, so I asked him about it. He says they are \"new company, specializing in no wait service\" I asked him for ID and he says there just too new to have it. Im no sucker but I bet someone would have bought the whole game. He was on it..... So I said no and he was like \"well you can go wait in line down there\" and I look to see that only 2 people are in the real taxi line. Come on...so we walk down there and ask the people at he taxi line if there is such a thing as an unmarked private taxi company (seems obvious) and they say there are no private companies in Vegas. The guy just completely takes off as soon as we starting talking to the staff at Bally's. Such a crook. Dont know what he would have done, maybe stole our stuff or worse. So shady and creepy. Be wise out there, you never know. Don't ever let your guard down. Thats all I can think of. I would definately go back to the Barbary. I just wanted to write this becasue I saw a lot of bad reviews for this place and I think people just expect different things. If you have a lot of money this may not be your ideal getaway in the lap of luxury, but if you are short on cash and dont want to spend it on a hotel this is the place to be.

We were in Vegas for our wedding, and had two nights at the Barbary and then three nights at the Bellagio ( where the wedding was being held ) and after seeing the room, we both wished that we had the room the whole 5 nights and only stayed at the Bellagio the night of the wedding - it was that good and a real bargin ( especially compared the the Bellagio prices! ). Some of our other wedding guests who were staying elsewhere were kicking themselves that they didn't stay at the Barbary also as they were paying a lot more for a lot less! The location is probably the best in Vegas - and certainly the best for the price! An easy walk everywhere and to everything! The staff were also extremely good to one of our wedding guests who was very ill and ended up in hospital - they went out of their way to assist with extending the stay, arranging transport to the hospital and even constantly checked up on the patients process.

Had the best time. It is a small hotel (about 200 rooms), so check-in is fast (about 10 minutes), and we were in our room five minutes later. At first, we were placed in a room with two Queen beds rather than the single King we had requested, so we went back downstairs to the desk and they switched us immediately, with no questions and no hassles. The new room renovations look wonderful, as does the casino after its recent facelift. The decorations and furniture are tasteful, and the new plasma screen tvs are very impressive. As is the view from the room (see photos). As an added bonus, the little stained glass window in the bathroom can be opened so that you can get both fresh air and all of the sounds of the strip. Down in the casino, the bartenders and waitresses were always prompt, courteous, and friendly. As were the slot club attendants. This is no small thing over the crowded New Year's weekend, the busiest of the year! On New Year's eve, just after midnight (when we came back inside after cheering our lungs out), we sat down at some nickel slots and had a waitress come by about every 15 or 20 minutes or so. Two years ago, when we stayed at the Aladdin, I do not think we saw a single one (not to bag too much on the Aladdin, we loved it there too, but they are simply too big to have that kind of waitress to customer ratio... Oh yeah, and Aladdins buffet is truly amazing. Well worth the wait). And the bartenders and the rest of the employees were also very busy, but never too busy to help us out or even just smile and say hello. Makes you feel appreciated. In the wee hours, we ate at the Victorian room, which is one of the better diner style places on the strip. Try the chinese food and the steak and eggs. Pretty reasonably priced and pretty damn good. People complain about noise at the Barbary, but it has never been a problem for us. Either we keep getting the quiet rooms, or we are just heavy sleepers. To sum up: Great service, nice rooms, good value, excellent location, and easy access. Keep in mind though, if you are looking for extra fancy, huge, impressive hotels, the Barbary is not for you.

When we checked in, I asked if it would be possible to get a view and the woman at the front desk said that they had already set aside a room with a fantastic view based on our request. I didn't think that any hotels actually took requests seriously but, the Barbary actually tries to honor them. Go figure. Anyway, the rooms have recently been remodeled. Appeared to be new carpet, wallpaper, furnishings, and television. The bedding was a little worn looking but, otherwise, a very clean hotel room. The bathroom itself (toilet and shower) is a little small, but not unreasonable. Plus, we enjoyed having the sink area separate from the rest of the bathroom. That way, you don't have to de-fog the mirror everytime someone gets out of the shower. The one downside on the accommodations is the street and air/heater noise. When we turned on our air, the wall unit started clanking and grinding. It subsided, but the unit was still quite loud while it was running. The funny part is, we ended up turning the air on at night just to drown out some of the street noise. The Barbary is on an extremely busy intersection and you can, most certainly, here the traffic. It is not unbearable but, I would consider bringing some earplugs or some \"white noise\" contraption with you if you are a light sleeper and plan to stay here for several nights. We were able to take advantage of the complimentary shuttles to the Orleans and the Gold Coast on several occassions. The shuttles arrives about every 20 minutes and there are different shuttles for different routes. The only downside with the shuttle is that no one really forms a line while waiting so, if it is busy, the boarding gets a little crazy.

I choose the Barbary Coast for the exact reason that a lot of people would over look it. It was small, did not have a swimming pool, it did not have any special attractions and it was quoted as being \"Victorian\" in decor. It became our safe heaven from all that is Vegas, when we needed a break. To some that might be a turn off, to me it was perfect. My husband and I loved the location it was easy access to the Monorail that we used everyday we were there, and within walking distance to some of our favorite places like Paris, Desert Passage and the Flamingo which we really liked. The room we had was wonderful. I loved the burgundy colors and the brass king size bed. I like to stay up late and read and the drapes that separate the bedroom from the little sitting room made it a great place to read while not bothering my husband.

When we got our room it was like going back in time to the old west, like in an old western movie thats how it was decorated, the brass head board the colours, we were really pleased with the room, so it had a small bathroom big deal, how much room does someone need to get cleaned up or take a shower. My son had come with us and this was his first time to Las Vegas and he was quite thrilled with it all, he had lust turned nineteen so was unable to gamble but this did not really concern him, although he appeared to be old enough that the security did not notice so they always wallked right on by. We really enjoyed the restaurant their great steaks good service. Now the only problems that we encountered were the elevators or should I say the one elevator, and our room keys. The elevator was really really slow and the other was always under repair for a week, guest were always waiting for an elevator I found this to be a little annoying at times. Now the room keys, I found this a little odd my wife and sons room keys had stopped working but mine still functioned, so we went down to the front desk and the attendant said oh! you have been here to long, I replied that we had booked for seven nights as per usual while in Las Vegas, she just looked at me with a smug look gave me new room keys, very rude no class what so ever, just turned her back like we did not exsist, oh well I thought, oh and getting a cab (FORGET IT!) good luck in this department, the bellman had to stand in the street and whistle real! loud! needless to say we tipped him for his great effort, other than that we love Las Vegas.", "Date": "February 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "boise", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2945174", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend decided to stay here when we decided to add an extra day to the begining of our trip.

First I asked for late checkout at the front desk, and they said no problem, then I asked for king with view of belagio fountains, they said no problem. We got 302 last room down the hall and with a great view. Now there was the ballys sign across the street which played all night but not so bad you can't sleep well. The view totally makes up for it. 25 dollars per night was nice too. Made us wish we had stayed there instead of the over rated aladin down the street where our strip view comprised of the paris balloon and some wall. Just on a side note I think vegas is in for some knocks down the road. Customer service is at an all time low, stinks of corporation most places you go on the strip. Sad cause I really used to like going there. They really need to start remembering they have to earn my money just like I had to, sticking too downtown and off strip from now on.

Excellent location, right in the middle of the Strip. I thought the room was very nice - large and well maintained. Beds were very comfortable, as well. Free parking available in their parking garage. It\u2019s actually around the corner from Las Vegas Blvd., which made it a little hard to find, but once located, the fact that it\u2019s off the drag makes it easier to access. I thought that it was a fantastic value. Hey, its not the Bellagio, but point out the time periods when I can get the Bellagio for $20 a night! Regarding a few of the negative comments I've read here: The bathroom was kind of small (but not that small - how much room do you need to take a bath?). No, it didn't have a Jacuzzi (refer to the $20/night observation). It doesn't have a pool, which wasn't an issue for me, but it might be for some people. As was pointed out previously, you can take a shuttle to one of their sister hotels for that. They also don't have a fitness facility, although I was told that (the Orleans, I believe) does, and can be accessed by shuttle. Remember that there is like a three hour turn around for their shuttle schedule. They also don't have any wi-fi access points in their hotel, which was a bit of an issue for me. I had just stayed a couple of nights at the Las Vegas Club, which was arguably not as nice a place, and they did have a wi-fi \"hot spot.\" Lastly, regarding employees with \"attitude\"... In general, I found the staff to be reasonably courteous and helpful (one of the guys at the front desk was kind of distant, but not bad). The exception, however, was the hostesses at the restaurants (Michaels, the Victorian Room). I did find a noticeable \"don't let the door hit you on the butt\" demeanor from a number of employees there. By the way, I do have to say that the food and ambiance was very good, however. I think that some people believe that an aloof staff is required in a nice restaurant (#!* those French, anyway).", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ames, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great view (at least from my room: 401)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2308854", "Content": "Easy access from parking lot.

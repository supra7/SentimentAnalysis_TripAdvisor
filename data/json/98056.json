We decided to book this hotel because it was relatively close to Beale Street, and wasn't especially expensive. We stayed on a Tuesday night, so it was very quiet. When we got there, they initially gave us two rooms with a king sized bed instead of two rooms with two doubles in each. The staff apologized and switched our room without any problem. We also locked our key in our room, so we got an extra without any problem. We didn't use the wifi. There was no free breakfast or anything, but we had planned to go to Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken anyway. Pros: The rooms really weren't that bad. They were clean and relatively nice looking. The bathrooms looked very new and very clean. The hotel staff was friendly. The drive from the motel to Beale Street was very short. Cons: Much of the parking lot was being redone, so we couldn't park directly outside of our room. The pool was empty; the pool, ice machines, and vending machines probably hadn't been used in years. The front lobby was being renovated, and the hotel was for sale. It wasn't exactly in the greatest area of town, and the next morning there were some sketchy people lurking around. Only one room had a mini fridge and microwave in it. Overall, I would say for the price, it wasn't terrible. If you're a college student with some friends staying the night after a concert drinking a few beers and partying a little bit, go for it. It's probably ideal for a stay for more than a night or so, and not really a family place, but the hotel could be a lot worse.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cTAXI DRIVER\u201d", "Author": "lois s", "ReviewID": "UR126156539", "Content": "Taxi driver in memphis, i pick up and drop at many hotels and this one never gets a good review.i should have known better.These room are sold very cheaply during the week days and sold at the max during events. property unkept(CHECK CURRENT PICTURE ON GOOLE MAP) rooms and bed are ratty and nasty.

On checking on, we were told there was no breakfast as it is only served on weekends. Our printed confirmation meant nothing, there is no breakfast Mondays to Fridays. The \"free\" wifi is only okay if it is working which is wasn't. We were then told they had called their ISP but nothing was fixed before we left. We will never stay there again. And booking.com didn't do anything about it either, except to say they contacted the hotel who basically refuted our complaint. This whole episode was badly managed by everyone. Also the hotel is near a noisy highway.

However, the room we were placed in was different to the one we were initially shown: it stank, the bathroom sink was clogged and building materials and cigarette butts were strewn everywhere outside our room. Someone knocked on our door in the wee hours of the morning and we heard the cops walking around the grounds during the nght - this did not make me feel safe at all. The pool was covered and did not seem to be in use (not that would have put a toe in anyway). This was by far the worst hotel we stayed at on our trip and I really wish we'd had had computer access to check the reviews here before our stay....

It was an absolute rip off. Continental breakfast was very bad coffee, weird looing juice and cold danish in a package. The shuttle to Beale street was $3.50 each way per person. They told us a cab was more expensive. So once we got there we asked a cab driver how much back to hotel and he said around $8. So on New years eve we chose to call a cab. Especially since they decided they weren't going to run the shuttle (even after passing out information upon check in about the shuttle schedule on 12/31). Lots of students staying there which wasn't a big deal because it was Liberty Bowl, but they ran out of towels at the hotel. Towels were nothing more than a piece of cloth anyway, but they should have been more prepared knowing they were sold out. Front desk folks were friendly, but they didn't know anything about the trolley system which is one of the other reasons I chose this paced to begin with (it was on trolley line that went to Beale). It is definitely not a place I'd stay again. Doesn't seem to be the best part of town, even if it was convenient to Beale Street in a cab.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jonesboro, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cit was awfulllllllllll\u201d", "Author": "small870", "ReviewID": "UR122383130", "Content": "this place is a dump need to be shut down fast......... run down bad not safe... trash omg....", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joplin, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDo Not under any circumstance stay here Ever.\u201d", "Author": "nevereveragain_11", "ReviewID": "UR106567731", "Content": "When reservations were made, rooms were quoted at $ 120 per night due to the Beale Street Music Festival..when we arrived $145..then with 3 of us in a room, we only had 2 towels..they charged us $10 per extra towel..Rooms were filthy, very run down place...worst part: The cleaning lady told us to lock all of our things in our car when we left, because, the owner always went through the rooms when guests were out!!!!!!!!..Our other friends, also staying there were greeted with a recent hatch of cockroaches...This was the absolutely worst lodging available...I would have preferred joining the homeless on the street corner...!!!!!!!!!!!!

Staying at the Econo Lodge was one of our best experiences in our travels. The front desk clerks, Rick, Jeremy and Lauri were very friendly and made our stay very pleasant. They were all helpful with our stay from check in to check out. Our trip was 4 days and during our stay, we had a very nice man named Jerry that attended our room. He made sure everything was clean and we had everything we needed to make our stay more enjoyable. I would recommend the Econo Lodge to anyone! Thanks to a GREAT staff at Econo Lodge. We will be back and will definitely being staying there again!

This Econo Lodge had the 3rd best rate compared to its neighbors on a Saturday night, but it was worth the few extra dollars. I stayed in a single king and the room was freshly remodeled with microwave and personal size refrigerator. It was a little smaller than a comparable room I stayed in at one of the competitors but had a nicer d\u00e9cor and new mattress. The Econo Lodge had a larger variety of TV channels compared to some of the others on the block that will make the price difference worth it when I return with my youngest. The room was very clean and the staff was very courteous. Breakfast had longer hours than most which was also a plus to me. This is a nice property in this price range and I am returning soon to check their double rooms.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cRoom Clean, Courteous Clerks, Great Value\u201d", "Author": "JB B", "ReviewID": "UR132972101", "Content": "I've stayed in Branson for over 20 years at different hotels, depending on how long or how many were with me and how much I wanted to spend on a room. I had become unhappy with the hotel I usually stayed at for the last two years as it had become less clean, clerks less friendly and concerned. What a wonderful surprise Econo Lodge was. Large clean, nicely decorated room, refrig and microwave, quiet, good bed, good breakfast choices and the clerks I talked too seem really interested that I have a good stay there. The price was unbelieveably reasonable for this kind of room. A new renovation, inside and out, had just been finished the week before.

They are remodeling the rooms and it looks like they had just painted the outside. Beds where not to hard or soft and where not wore out and did not look like they where 100 yrs old. The carpet was nice and clean and didnt make your feet/socks black when you walked across it. All rooms are 100 percent smoke free which we had ppl that smoked with us and we just went outside and smoked. We didnt make any reservation and just walked up and got 2 rooms which one was not cleaned yet but the lady at the front desk went and got the house keeper and she got right on it and clean the room for us.Towels where white and didnt look old and wore out. Pools is not to big but was nice and clean. Hot tub did not work but they have put new chairs by the pool they still had the paper on them. Love that it is right behide walmart and it didnt take no time to get to the main strip.

We have stayed at this motel, in the same room, every year for 6 years, which we again requested 6 months before our arrival. When we arrived, we were told that this room was not available & given a smaller room, which we were told would be at a cheaper rate. At checkout time,however, an attempt was made to charge us the higher rate & only after my refusal, did I get the lower rate from a very unfriendly clerk. Also, the bottom of the stool looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time & the bathroom floor was sticky. When we pointed this out to the clerk, again, she acted very disgusted with us,& said, \"I'll tell someone\", which never happened while we were there. Needless to say, we spent part of our trip this time, looking for another motel, & found a much cleaner & friendlier place to stay when we come back at Christmas.

Bed was hard which after 5 hours I would be up due to back problems. Rooms were clean, continental breakfast was decent. Chairs were older and we had to use a pillow in the seat to be able to sit in them. The room was just not comfortable due to the furnishings. The Motel is in a good location, the grounds were well kept and their booking system seems to have a major problem with giving you what you paid for.

It was clean but old, & the tub had something chipping off the bottom of it. The bed was the worst I've ever slept on. I would get my dog a better bed to sleep on than that. So uncomfortable-you could feel the metal coils. In vending everything was melted. The hot tub was drained & filthy. The pool was tiny, but clean. The free breakfast was canned mixed fruit, donuts from a box, frozen waffles. It was food-barely. Next day a new lady was there, and she was hostile as well. Apparently, they are having leadership issues, and the unprofessionalism was revolting. The only professional was a teenage girl that worked there, who checked us out when we left--4 days early. We had even paid for another night, but I couldn't take another minute there. It was an atrocity. This is a bad bed, bad food, a roof, a tv, and a hostile person taking your money.

Also outside entrances which we usually try to stay away from, but this place had doors that sealed well. I have seen some doors that have a big enough gap to allow critters to come in for a visit.

Hotel is only 2 blocks away from a great bike/walking trail along the San Diego River. The neighborhood is fine. We took several walks around. Lots of good independent eateries and also chains (if you want....) . There is a CVS pharmacy right across the street where you can get groceries, wine, sundries.

If you don't take the turn immediately you will end up on the freeway and waste an abundance of time. Don't let the exterior of the building fool you.l As you enter the building you are greeted very friendly by the front desk. The reception area is tasteful, modern and the adjacent breakfast area is clean and welcoming. I had a non-smoking room which had modern furnishings, pillow top beds, fair size fridge & microwave. I wasn't impressed with the overall area however it was in close proximity to the Sports Arena and accessible to major freeways. The room was clean and the bathroom really impressed me with a granite countertop; something I wasn't expecting. The TV was the old type but they are slowing being replaced by flatscreens. I did not think the coffee pot was sanitary as it was made all of plastic and you drop the filter in as well. So when I wanted to make tea, my tea tasted terrible as it smelled like coffee or a mix of the two. Those need to be replaced by a new system with a glass carafe. The walls are relatively thin so that was a downfall if there was someone noisy next door. The hotel is fairly quiet and you do not hear the street noise.The free breakfast was great offering cereal, milk, yoghourt, juices, pancakes, toast, bagels, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, coffee, muffins, hard boiled eggs. There is a computer in the reception area you may use with free internet and there is an elevator in the building. My major concern would be the back door which is connected to the parking lot does not close properly which is next to the elevator as well. This is not a good security feature as if someone does not check the door behind them, it won't close properly and anyone can enter the elevator and roam the halls. The reception area has survelliance and monitors it however this is not enough. For the safety of the guests, and being the brand name holiday inn, it is imperative the door get replaced. Guests must use their room cards for the door to open however, sometimes the door sticks. I must say the hotel definitely is great value and the staff really try hard to make your stay as pleasant as possible.

The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable with soft and cozy linens, but the constant door slamming made relaxing and getting a good nights sleep nearly impossible. Why oh why can't hotels come up with a door closing system that will avoid the loud BANG when inconsiderate hotel guests let the door slam? I've always been mystified by that. Also there were children running up and down the hallway, but there's not a whole lot the hotel can do about rude parents who can't or won't control their children. The room had a small fridge and a microwave, and we used the former but not the latter and the fridge actually kept things cold, which seems to be not a consistent feature with hotel fridges. We had one hotel (not this one) tell us that the fridges in the room were actually \"cooler boxes\" and so weren't expected to keep the items cold. What? That's just ridiculous. Dolly at the front desk was very sweet and helpful, and there were great \"welcome\" cookies by the registration desk that were a nice perk. She also presented me with a gift bag of snacks for being a HIE Priority Customer when I checked into the hotel. Parking is tight but there seemed to be plenty of spaces, at least there were at the times we needed to park. There's a shopping center across the street with several restaurants and a pharmacy (if memory serves it was a CVS) so good places to eat are withing walking distance. You just take your life into your hands if you attempt to jaywalk across Sports Arena Blvd. Play it safe and walk a bit to use the signal just a short ways down the street. Oh, lots of street noise and police/fire sirens as well. Windows are not what I would call soundproof by any means.

The hotel and room were very clean. The room came with a frig and microwave and HBO. There is no pay-per-view channels, or room safe. There is a breakfast provided each morning; fruit, breads, juices, eggs, biscuit and gravy, and bacon. Not special, but because it was free it will save you from having to go out and buy breakfast. The eating area is a little small, but you can always take the meal to your room. The pool and outdoor jacuzzi were a little small. Nothing special. I think they close at 10:00PM. I can see why other people said the parking was tight, it is limited, but while we were there we had no problems finding a spot.

After having read previous reviews and expecting the worst I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel is NOT the Holiday Inn next to Bakers Restaurant which a lot of the reviews written here are about. We stayed for 10 nights and had a trouble free stay. The rooms were spotlessy clean and the housekeeping was fantastic. Clean towels every day and toiletries replaced daily as well. There is undercover parking which was a bit tight but we had no trouble getting a parking spot everyday. Well situated for getting about, a taxi Downtown or to Mission Beach was about $16 (approx \u00c2\u00a39) where there are loads of places for eating and drinking. In walking distance of the hotel is a Soup Plantation which is just across the road - they have a buffett style salad & soup bar which is great when you have had enough of eating enormous portions and just want something reasonably light. Denny's (also across the road) is good for breakfast. We also walked down to Red Lobster and Phils BBQ and had great food at both. We had no problems walking about at night, you don't see many other people but we never felt unsafe. We mainly had breakfast at Bakers Restuarant ( next to the other Holiday Inn ) and Bakers is also excellent for afternoon cake & coffee. Bakers also has a bar attached to it - unfortunately it calls last orders at 10.15pm but you can get a couple of drinks in after your evening meal. For great shopping head to the border to the Las Americas Outlets, we spent the day there and bagged some real bargins. I can also recommend Old Town and the Navy Carrier HMS Midway is well worth a visit.

He also said that no one else was there who could help me! He was able to tell me how to get there from the freeway but didn't know if I should go north or south from Sea World - after driving north on the 5 for 10 miles I turned around and found that it was the next exit just south of Sea World. By the time got there I was not a happy camper but tried to give him the benefit of the doubt as he was new. Driving in from the freeway I almost headed to another hotel that I was familiar with in downtown San Diego becuase of the fact that there were strip clubs and adult book stores on every corner for several blocks coming off of the freeway. After I turned toward the hotel it got a little better but, being there by myself with just my son, it was a litte unnerving (sp?)! Check in went fine but there wasn't enough parking in the lot closest to our room so we had to walk across several dark parking lots to get to the building.

Not a place I really wanted to hang out for the morning! We did get a free voucher for a free children's breakfast at Bakers Square so that was a plus.

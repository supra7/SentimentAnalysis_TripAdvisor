I booked this trip through interval according to its rating\" Premier\", well the only thing that makes the grand seas a premier resort is its location. The views are beautiful, beach is clean and close. Unfortunately I believe this hotel draws many undesirables on the weekends. Our room was not as clean as I would have liked, the hallways and elevators were dirty and smelled of beer. The outdoor pool areas were meticulously cleaned. One thing I noticed was anyone from the beach area can come in and use the resort, there are no security to prevent outsiders to enter. Also there were never enough lounge chairs in the pool areas because many people reserve them with towels for the day and never return to use them. As far as our room, I feel they skimp on cleaning. The rooms really need to be thoroughly cleaned maintenance needs to wipe down the walls and windows, vacuum the dirt behind all furniture. The kitchen was small but appliances were clean.

I have to say, the beach was amazing & the hotel was right on the beach. We did not mind not having a balcony at all & we did have plenty of space for everyone to have room & not be up in everybody's business. We didn't even mind the fact that they didn't have housekeeping every day ... They did offer clean towels & sheets every day. We knew it was a rome share & were prepared to be bothered to purchase one. What we did have an issue with was safety. The lack of security & the fact that management was so out of touch with what was really going on in and on their property. There was an incident where a young adult male (24 yrs old) was soliciting young girls (14-16 yrs old) and our daughter happened to be a selected target. That didn't work out well for him at all!! Dad got ahold of him & took care is the situation. Came to find out that our daughter was the 3rd victim in 2 days!! We did notify security & they did nothing. Then we were robbed in our room. It was an inside job. They took cash & prescription meds. That had been just a few hours that I had not locked up my purse in the safe while we were at the pool. We did tell the front desk & they did nothing. Police said that we needed to get out of that hotel immediately!! We then learned that one of our credit cards had fraudulent charges on it at a Florida establishment. The bank quickly handled the issue. And we again notified the front desk & requested to speak to management & we were NEVER contacted by anyone to follow up. Keep in mind, my family had spent almost 10 days at this resort at this point. We were ending our vacation & got out as quickly as we could. We did not feel safe knowing someone had entered our room with either a key made by the front desk or another means of overriding the electric key-door lock. Bottom line ... No matter how great the location is ... If you can't feel safe there it will ruin what time you do have left ... We moved onto another beach & hotel altogether.

I walk into the resort and immediately there was already a confrontation going on about an incorrect reservation. Instead of empathizing with the guest the front desk just shook their head and continued to argue with the guest. Either the front desk personnel were not trained properly or the owner does not care. I then had to find where the carts were, find my car, unload it in the pouring rain, and attempt to get this cart into my room to unload it. I was also surprised to find that all the studios didi not have a balcony, as advertised. There were paint chips falling from the ceiling at the window, obviously in need of repair. The mattress was old and sagged in the middle. I had made two more trips to the front desk for information only to find confrontations with dissatisfied guests each time. There were plenty of staff around but no one would help with any issues and often speak in their own foreign language during one of the front desk confrontations.

Front desk personnel were extremely rude and unaccommodating when I just called down to complain about the piercing alarm sound that has gone off in the room every 2 minutes for the last half hour. Apparently, maintenance is testing the alarm system and they \"can do nothing about it\" what was extra insulting is the glee with which they say \"my pleasure\" at the end of every call whether it was pleasant for the customer or not! This is our last day here, and boy are we glad to be headed home tomorrow! Upon arrival, we were permitted to check in an hour early as our room was ready.That was nice. We were informed that we had to see the concierge to get our \"pool bracelets\". This is their ruse to get you to go face to face with the guy who will attempt to schedule you to attend a breakfast sales presentation. There is no real breakfast (donuts and coffee) and the presentation takes more than an hour. We went for the free \"sand dollars\" (resort credit for meals). The vacation package/plan they are selling is a big ripoff, but the little restaurant, Gilligans, has a good breakfast special and the food was yummy (and the Gilligans staff is very, very nice), and you can use your sand dollars there if you choose to endure the sales pitch to get them. FYI- nobody seems to be checking for those bracelets at the pool. In fact, they do not seem to care much about whatever goes on around here. The room was old, floors were dirty as others have observed, no hangers in the closet (we had to call 3x to get some), fixtures old, dust and other peoples' odd junk (hair ties, books) found behind furniture. No garbage disposal, whirlpool jets in the tub spewed black gunk. Brought plenty of lysol products and decided that we are basically camping out. The view is awesome from the upper floors, almost worth the grief of dealing with the rude and unhelpful staff and the sub-par accommodations. The one day our room was to be cleaned was Wednesday, but staff came in on Tuesday while we were at breakfast. Our belongings were tossed into corners, floor was mopped, but fold away bed was left open, so a large bit of the floor was left unmopped. Strong smell of bleach in the room was the first tipoff that they had been by. We were not pleased. We have stayed at many different places via timeshare exchanges, but this was by far the worst both with regard to the facility and the staff.

When looking up from the pool, people had their windows open and the drapes were blown outside by the breeze because of no screen. Very tacky, looked like a real 'seedy' place from below. It looks like it has not been renovated since at least 1950 with old, old appliances, the stove was rusty in parts, one burner was broken and did not work, and the oven had not been cleaned in a very long time, the floor molding was coming off and rusted at the corners, a bad uncomfortable mattress pad on the small Murphy bed. On and the bathroom had one small mirror and no mirrors at all in the room. I would never use that bathtub as a jacuzzi spa. The vents were black, looked dirty. I wish I had looked on this site of trip advisor before I booked. And those who said this so-called resort was great, either do not expect anything at all or must work for this resort in some capacity. The only saving grace was the beautiful view of the ocean, nice flat screen TV, and the small restaurant/bar attached was okay and the food quite nice and reasonably priced. But all in all it, will go down as 1 on a scale from 2 to 10; 10 being best. I hope we never have to experience a dumpy place like this again. In the paperwork I had, there was a fee to change rooms.

Its part of staying on the ocean! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful in every way... going above and beyond to help us! One guy even used his own internet to find a location for us on his break... not many people would do that where we are from. The area in general is very laid back, the people are interesting, fun, sooo friendly and non judgemental! We LOVE daytona beach/ormond beach! This resort is not right \"downtown\" near all the activities, boardwalk, bars, etc, but its right down the street, we even walked it a couple times which is a beautiful walk along the beach! The buses run frequently up and down atlantic so we didnt even rent a car and we got everywhere we wanted to go and more! We actually liked the fact that this resort is a little further north because the beaches arent even close to as crowded its more peaceful and relaxing! No there arent balconies on the beach side, but we got a room that had a balcony type walk in the hallway.. which was almost as good... and the view from our room is amazing!! The entire wall is a window! There was plenty of space and included everything we needed for a week stay. I wouldnt say its a 5 star resort but its pretty darn nice, and only a snob would complain about this resort! We werent bothered at all about a timeshare, and when we were asked once they left us alone aterwards. If you dont use the internet they dont charge you the resort fee. We didnt see one single bug in our room just amazing and beautiful beaches. The pools are clean and beautiful, it would be such a great place for a family with the waterslides and playground and mini golf. We really liked the hot tubs outside which are great on a chilly night. The bar is nicely located and friendly. The food at gilligans is GREAT and not too expensive, and is nicely decorated and modern. Their specials are awesome.

We had initially booked an efficiency unit but declined the one assigned when we realized that the Murphy bed was approximately 15 inches off the floor and there was paint spattered on the kitchen floor. We were told that all efficiency units have Murphy beds - a fact not noted on our confirmation page. We were told by the resort that we could \"upgrade\" for $150 for the week. After phoning Interval to complain, we were advised that we would receive a waiver for the next time we exchange. My husband and I agreed and were given the keys to a one bedroom unit. Upon entering, we noted a minimum of TEN DEAD INSECTS on the floor plus TWO dead insects on the headboard of the bed. Again we returned to the lobby to decline the second room and were given keys to Rm 5010. After nearly 90 minutes of being hassled, we were finally in a marginal but more acceptable room. The Grand Seas is more of a glorified six story motel - the building, inside and out, is poorly maintained. Outside, we noted chipping paint, rusting around elevator openings, filthy elevator doors, paint spatters everywhere, broken glass and other debris by the steps leading to the beach which were present for our entire six day stay, trash containers that were full for several days at a time plus incessant country music in the lobby and on the ground floor. Inside Rm 5010, we noted chipped floor tiles, stained grout, dirty bathrooms, dirty soap dish in bath/shower, stained toilet seat lid, dirty hand prints on all doors, furniture that was chipped, wall that had paper/sheetrock peeled off/paint missing, windows that needed washing, stained seat cushion on furniture, and stains on curtains in living and bedrooms. Another major negative is that the Grand Seas does not allow anyone to move lounge chairs from the pool to the beach area and one would have to rent such lounge chairs from a vendor at an absurd cost of $35/day per chair. There are several positives to this resort \u2013 the young women who helped us to obtain a more suitable room were pleasant and the maintenance worker arrived within 10 minutes to repair the door lock. Although there are no balconies on the upper floors, the view of the beach was gorgeous from our 5th floor room and the location was convenient to grocery store, restaurants, museum.

We thought that was unusual. Our first room had a kitchen that was extremely small and to our way of thinking unusable. The television blanked out repeatedly. The sink does not have a garbage disposal. They do not provide filters for the coffee maker so that had to be our first trip to the store. Since we had exchanged a Marriott Barony Beach property for this through Interval International we were very disappointed with the Grand Seas. The Grand Seas is only 25% of the property we deposited for the exchange. We arrived late and didn\u2019t check everything out before falling into a very uncomfortable bed. In the morning we discovered ants every where in the master bedroom. We then moved down to the second floor to a unit that had a much better kitchen, still without a garbage disposal. 3 of the 4 outlets in the kitchen did not work and one of the outlets did not have a cover on it. A call to the front desk got that corrected. After walking around the room for a while, in our bare feet and socks, we discovered that the floors are so dirty that the bottoms of our feet turned black. It was disgusting. We called to have the floors washed. Really!!! The bottom cover of the refrigerator was missing and we had a wonderful view of a rusting gaping hole. I don\u2019t know how fast things rust down here but this looks like it has been through a few hard winters driving the streets of Boston. The exhaust fan vents were caked with dust, the kind that you get if you don\u2019t clean them for several months. Housekeeping came and cleaned our room. They say they washed the floor but our feet still turn black when we walk from the bedroom to the kitchen and then to the living room. When they cleaned the exhaust vent in the shower they left black foot prints on the bottom of the shower. We had to wash the shower before we could use it. The television in the second bedroom did not work. They came and changed it out and couldn\u2019t get that television to work either. I don\u2019t expect them to come back voluntarily.

I usually do all my research ahead of time, but I didn't do any research until after I booked and was very concerned about what our vacation would look like. I originally booked a one-bedroom unit, but had to call about another Interval reservation and the Interval rep said there was a two-bedroom unit available so he reserved that for me instead. When we arrived, the desk staff was very nice. I was tired after a long day of driving and they realized that and quickly got me all the information I needed. I was pleasantly surprised that we had a room on the ground floor with a patio. Much to our daughter's delight, our patio went right out to the mini golf course. I'm accustomed to beach properties as my parents have a large private home on the Caribbean and I've vacationed at some pretty exclusive beach locations around the world. There are some things I have experienced, no matter what level of resort I've been at...I've had a scorpion in my bathroom at the Ritz; I've had a cockroach in my room at the Atlantis; I've been stung by jelly fish on the beach outside my resort in Mexico. Based on the reviews of the Grand Seas, I was prepared to be overwhelmed by bugs, malfunctioning appliances, dirty rooms, etc, and I was surprised that this was not the case at all. My daughter is deathly afraid of bugs and she is always on the prowl, but we had not a single bug in our unit during our entire week. Our appliances worked perfectly. The ice maker pumped out ice to keep our drinks cool all week. Our jacuzzi tub was awesome. My husband thought the bed was a bit firm, which I actually liked, and I thought the pillows were a little too fluffy, which he actually liked. The bedroom our daughter had bordered the parking lot and I was concerned about the noise as she is a very light sleeper, but she slept straight through every night without a problem. We went to the on-site restaurant one night for tacos, but the tacos didn't look that appetizing, so we walked across the street to Ruby Tuesday's instead. We did have lunch one day in the restaurant and it was good and the staff was very nice and efficient. The tile floor does for some reason make your feet dirty. We put two hand towels down on the floor in two places in our unit and that seemed to keep our feet cleaner. We did the timeshare sales pitch, which I always agree to (and my husband hates!). My parents own with seven different companies and I manage their properties and this program is one of the worst I've seen. We didn't buy and I will say the free promotions they give you are the cheapest I've ever seen as well. But, it was just a small bit of time during our fabulous week.

Let me list the problems with the room first: No light bulb in a sofa lamp, the stripping on the bottom of the shower door was hanging by one corner, several wands to open and shut the curtains were missing, the toaster didn't work, the fridge had no light, the kitchen had ants, the sound for the TV in the master bedroom took awhile to warm up, the 1st room we tried didn't have internet,(it was too far from the server) the curtains for the bedroom on the hall were louvered and let in too much light, in the master bath there were no towel racks by the bathroom sink, nor were there any hooks, the shower pressure was very weak the mattresses were poor, and to top it off, there was no DVD player. We had trouble getting a 2nd parking pass even though we had a 2 bedroom and were two families. We understood one pass per unit, but we had originally had 2 one bedrooms and we had switched when we got there. The restaurant on site was nice.

Now.... when you talk about the pool area and ocean, the set up was the best I've seen. There were two large outdoor pools, one with a slide, a circular kiddie pool with a small slide and an indoor pool. The pool chairs were very cheap plastic and did crack easily but there were enough of them and they also had tables with umbrellas. They had a bar in the middle and even tho we didn't use it, it was nice. The ocean was right there. Boom! Down the steps and put out your chair. I had a great time. It was my best best beach trip ever. I liked this pool and beach set up better than any place I've stayed in Sanibel, Sarasota, Pensacola and Panama City Beach.

Mold in the jets on the side of the tub- did not even consider using the whirlpool- gross. First day had to call maint. to fix the fridge (blown fuse). Responded quickly and fixed it, but when I asked him to fix the bedroom closet door, he just pulled on the door to realign it. The screws could be seen coming out but apparently it was not an option to fix it then. Three or four days later it popped back out. The reason I gave two stars instead of one was the staff and the beach access. View was fantastic. Staff were great, always a smile and a hello, helpful, pleasant. The beach was great, not crowded like the places on either side of us, can see it from the pool; (did not get in the pool since I had doubts about the cleanliness but still a cool feature-looked clean, tho. Decent landscaping. If they could just get the property up to par (really, just clean the room and hire pest control already). Now, just in case someone from their management comes on and says \"if only you had informed us...\" I shouldn't have to tell you your place is not clean, hire someone to do spot checks, isn't there a supervisor for the cleaning staff checking on their work? The fridge-yes, the door-yes, cleaning-no, I will not advise you.

Overall, it is not such a terrible place but the sanitary condition has to be better than what is offered. I have never stayed at an hotel or resort where the rooms are cleaned only once a week.

The wireless network was nightmare. We paid a daily fee of $3 for something that never worked...shame, shame ,shame... My advice to Grand Seas personnel is to take all the guesses' complaints into consideration. I am sure others had complaints about similar issues, however, it is very clear that little has done to improve on the satisfaction of the guesses, otherwise i would not be writing about these issues. it is all about cashing in.

So needless to say, getting home and getting a good night's sleep was awesome. I hope the resort addresses the issue with the beds. I was not the only person whe experienced this.

Twice I went down for a cup of coffee, once the coffee pot was empty, the other time it was very cold.

However, the restaurant couldn\u2019t provide any change either. The least this resort could have done was to provide free washer and dryer to their guest.

One room the door would not lock properly, the new room then had a broken air conditioner. Another family had a roach in their room! Even though these family members got new rooms, all the rooms still showed lots of ware and tear.

One of the hot tubs wasn't working, but they were extremely relaxing with no dirt coming out of it. There were a little lovebugs in the hot tub so we had to get them out. The staff paid no attention to that. The laundry service was simply outstanding. All of our towels were clean and fresh. They had some very fun kid activities, but I think they should come up with better ideas.

We never expect much. We were not disappointed in the Grand Seas Resort, however. We had a 2-bedroom oceanfront condo. It was smaller than the pictures portrayed, and it would have been nice to have a king bed in the 2nd bedroom instead of a queen, but the accommodations were nice and the beds were very comfortable. We did have to mop the tile floors the morning after we arrived - we discovered the bottoms of our feet were black from walking barefoot on it all morning. The floors appeared to be clean so they had been swept, but apparently not mopped. The ice maker in the refrigerator didn't work, but we just got ice from the 2nd floor ice machine. There is no air supply vent in the guest bathroom so it gets pretty hot in there if the door is closed. And the kitchen supplies (dishes, etc.) are pretty sparce. But we saw NO roaches and we felt like everything was mostly clean, so we were quite comfortable. As to the resort amenities, the pool area is FABULOUS! If you want to hear music or you have children, stay at the South side pool area. If you want quiet and don't have children, the North side pool is perfect. The water temperature in the 2 poolside hot tubs is way too hot so we couldn't utilize them. The small putt-putt golf course at the end of the North pool is fun. The resort has workers on site at all times and they keep the exterior looking clean and wonderful. They did have some really loud work going on around the windows on the pool side of the resort (men on scaffolds doing drilling and creating a cloud of sheetrock dust) for several days, but I guess there is no good time for that kind of work. One thing I would suggest is that they lower the sound on the live music every afternoon/evening. We had to turn the television sound up really loud one evening in order to hear the movie we were watching - and we were on the 5th floor. I would have hated to have been on one of the lower floors. And pool security needs to be upgraded a bit. Although signs are posted everywhere that you have to wear the required wrist bands in the pool area, at least 50% would not. And one day it was obvious that a group of people that came in were not even guests of the resort. People also come in off of the beach who are not guests and use the pool facilities. They do have a security guard who walks around the pool area but we only saw him on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The rest of the week there is no guard and evidently the local people are aware of it and take advantage.

Another frustrating thing happened - the lawn service came in the middle of the day and one of the workers actually asked me to get up from where I was laying in a chair and move the chair along with all my belongings next to it so he could get to the small patch of grass behind me. I thought he was joking, but he waited with the hand-held gas-emitting weed whacker while I moved everything.

Little rubber or felt buttons would resolve this - we didn't complain about it but I can't imagine someone else hasn't.

We were wrong, the only modification we could find was the removal of the ocean front balconies. The room was nasty down to the furniture, and even after cleaning it remained filthy (they cleaned around everything including the dirt evidently). There is virtually no parking, dozens of hidden fees and charges on top of the $209 per night and our room had not 1 but 2 broken Microwaves. The hotel had more restrictions than GITMO, you had to wear an arm band to even be on the pool deck and if you didn't return it at check out there was a $15.00 fee. You even had to rent towels at the pool for $10 each every time you needed one. Our room keys had to be recoded at least 7 times in 3 days so we spent a lot of time in the front office. They were lots of guests making complaints every time we were there. We were given a \"free\" night for attending their timeshare presentation. We endured 90 minutes of sales puffery only to find that at checkout they charged us an additional $209 for the night and only the manager could reverse the charge and she would not be available until 2 hours after checkout time. We were given the option of waiting 2 hours or we could leave and they would call us when the credit was processed.

And while it is true that it has had a few rough years in the past, while recovering from hurricane damage, and undergoing a long term remodeling plan; it is a great place to spend a relaxing and/exciting vacation. The resort is actually a time share, which rents out available rooms as a hotel. So at any given time, the majority of those staying could be owners, rather than just hotel guests. The more newly remodeled rooms are taken by the time share owners first, so a hotel guest may end up in one of the older rooms that have not had the latest updates. Still, nearly every room in this resort faces the ocean, with a full wall of glass the only thing between you and a spectacular view of the beach. The last stay, the heater was not working on one of the two main pools on the expansive pool deck. One is normally kept at ocean temperature, while the other is usually heated to a nice warm temp. Both were cold with the heater being down. However, there is a smaller indoor pool that is toasty warm. We stayed in a two bedroom unit, which has a master bedroom with a roman whirlpool tub in the room, along with a separate shower area. The second bedroom shared a bath with the main room, full with shower. The main room has a sleeper sofa, as well as a large flat screen tv. Fully equipped kitchen allowed us to save a lot of money by eating in several times throughout the week, with a very large grocery store directly across the street from the resort. Some have complained about the car traffic on the beach, which did on occasion seem a bit much. But this is Daytona Beach. If you were not prepared to deal with this aspect of the beach, you should have gone somewhere else. The traffic is on the public part of the beach and is beyond Grand Seas control.

If you go to my review, I cover a lot of specifics that were pertinent at the time. The Grand Seas has made \"some\" progress in the last few years but I wouldn't say it was as much as I would have expected over the time since my last review. They have just begun to replace stoves and furnishings, entrance doors, etc. but still have work to do in terms of cleanliness and overall quality in the rooms. They apparently have replaced the washer/dryers on each floor and are doing repair work on the concrete walkways. They hopefully will do major work on the elevators because they seemed to be on their last leg on this visit. We were there in mid-April and the resort did not appear full, so parking was not an issue. I did see a guy working on a unit and he was putting in crown moldings around the ceiling, chair rails, two-tone paint, etc. He invited us in to see the work and mentioned that it was one of the owner's units. It looked great and he indicated that they were considering doing all the rooms in that style. The down side was that he was doing the work alone and said he had a regular job and this was a part-time sideline. My guess is he will have several years of work ahead unless they plan to hire a work crew to do this work - if they actually plan to do it. The maintenance fees are quite high at the GS and more should be done to upgrade rooms. Our biggest complaint w/our unit was the bathroom - old fixtures, etc. We also did not have new countertops in the kitchen but supposedly these are being replaced, albeit slowly. We have never had issues with making reservations but we are not (and never will be) Club Navigo members (see the 2005 review). I had requested an upper floor unit and when we arrived we were given a ground floor unit. I simply noted that we were promised a higher unit and we were moved w/no issues. Everyone was nice and the addition of the juice/coffee and snack party and margarita party was a plus - just be aware that the purpose is to get you to attend your \"owner update\" - going to that will subject you to the Navigo sales pitch - not a good deal in my opinion. As always, the beach and area provide the draw. The mall across the street has everything you need and the little Italian restaurant next to the Navigo (remember NEVERGO) sales office has great food for very reasonable prices. We walked in and got their special including salad, bread, homemade spinach ravioli, and a drink for $9.95. More than enough food, delicious, and we didn't have to drive!!! My biggest complaint is that almost every hotel in the country has free internet access (and/or a business center w/free access) except the Grand Seas - what's the deal folks? How can Super 8 provide it free for $80 bucks a night and a \"5-Star\" resort like the GS has to charge for it? Oh yeah, the manager never seems to be available. Maybe he knows that GS is less than advertised? Where does the buck stop at the Grand Seas?

The unit was well appointed, clean, adequately furnished and had a great location. The ocean view was worth every moment of viewing. The units are basiscally quiet (except for nights the loud music played by pool partyers who had little or no concern or respect for the other guests - but that was not the fault of the resort - other than providing security to control it). However - I would give the resort an 8 out of 10. A great place to vacation - a great beach and safe environemnt for a family with children. The negatives - parking issues and no balconies from which to enjoy the fantastic sunrises. But a short hike out to the beach with a cup of coffee in the morning will take care of that shortfall.

We traded through Interval. After reading the reviews listed here in TripAdvisor, I was very worried about going to this resort. It wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be. Our rooms were for the most part clean. They are trying to work on some of the issues. However, it looks like the interior walls, cabinets, counter tops, vents, etc have had water damage. They've improved some items, but they really need to keep spending money on improving the rest. The amenities, we felt, were very nice. Our family consists of mom, dad, 5 yr old twin boys and a 14 yr old daughter. We enjoyed their pools, playground, minature golf, pool bar, outdoor bands and beach. I have absolutely no complaint about that. I would not recommend this resort for young couples looking to hang out into the evening hours. The band and bars close relatively early. The pool/beach towels are on the chincy side. However, their bath towels were decent. If you're accustom to staying at Marriott or equivalent resorts, this is in no way a comparison. It is stated that this resort is a 5-star resort. What I've been told is that that doesn't mean the hotel is 5-star like most people would think. It means as a timeshare resort it offers many different activities for families/individuals to take part in and certain amenities for their guests/owners. They did have daily activities for families, individuals and children, which were fun. We were never harrassed by sales people trying to sell the resort. But, we laughed when we saw people that were being taken on tours. We would have loved to see the model they showed these people. If I were in the tour, I would have asked to see a \"real\" room. I'm sure the model room is perfect! Now, if they would bring the rest of their rooms up to that \"model\" standard.

Starting with check in, we were told that we did not have a reservation on file by a very unfriendly, unhelpful front desk employee. We were then told we had to call the 800 # for Club Navigo get the reservation information, at that point we were sent to the Cove at Ormond Beach for the night. Giving us two rooms on two different floors. Which doesn\u2019t work well with a family of six, of which four are under the age of ten. We didn\u2019t get things work out until almost 8PM that evening. Not a good start to a week long vacation. To top it all off we were forced out of the room at 10 AM, before I was ever able figuring out why we didn\u2019t have a reservation? Next it was off to the Club Navigo sales office to work on my issue. Which continual to be an unpleasant experience, the sale person helping me said he had fixed everything and to go over the hotel, I would be set, this was not the case. At this point I was get very upset again and had to return to the sales office. Final after 3 hours of getting the run around I had a conformation # and a room. By the way the reservation was in the system the whole time. This whole ordeal took up about a day and half of my vacation. Now this is when the fun begins, first off the room\u2019s look NOTHING like the model we were shown during our tour in December 2006. The kitchen was smaller then the model, \u00bd stove not a full range like in the model. No walk through bathroom to the second bedroom like the model. No flat screen TV\u2019s like the model? Pictures missing off the walls. Air vents were rusting and the AC was leaking water all over the floor. Which had to be fix twice while we were there, the over all cleanness of the unit had lot to be desired. Old wore furniture, dirty counter tops in the kitchen, grease & dirty blinds in kitchen, bugs in light fixtures through out the unit, lampshades not attached with on and off switch that were broken, just mention few the thing we notice. (Which I have picture to the above areas listed). A total remodel would be in order. Next the staff was not very pleasant at all, the staff in the restaurant took there time and had no sense of urgency, almost making you feel like you were interrupting they\u2019re day. Then there are the guests (outsider/locals) that were not guest of the resort that were using the pool the whole week we were there. Not very family friendly, like the guy that told my wife that he lived in Deland and everyday after work he would stop by the pool bar and have a few drinks while his children swam in the pool and the ocean in front of the so called resort. Also I never saw one employee of the resort policing the pool area so why waste the money on waist bans if you are not going to enforce the use of them. P.S. the man from Deland tried to pick up my wife, which is not what I would expect from 5 star resort guests. I will also say in general that most of the guest around the pool used foul language, had excessive tattoos and pricing all over they\u2019re bodies which I do not find offensive but is not what I would like my ten, nine, seven and four year old children to be exposed too. Continuing on with our unpleasant stay at the Grand Seas, I happen to notice that most of the cars in the south parking lot did not have parking permits issue from the hotel, another step you can do away because no body is policing the parking lots, As our mini van was run shacked our last night at the resort. When it\u2019s all said and done, we were very disappointed with what we have been sold, it is NOTHING close to what was presented to us when we tour the resort.

Read the fine print PLEASE. I will leave this story alone. (You do NOT stay at the Grand Seas with the $49.00 deal, you stay at a partner dump). We just paid the full price and canceled. 2. Hotel: What engineer would design a beach hotel without a balcony? Why is this important? a. The pool bar closed at 6:30, Sat. night, Memoial Day Weekend? The bar inside closed at 9:PM the same night. The resturant is only open 5pm-10pm and is $$$$ higher than Ruth Christ (Really). This FORCES you into your room. (Even the kids stated they could watch TV at home?) b. There are 2, 5'X5' elevators. weather they passed expection or not is questionable, but.........Take a family of 4, a cooler, boogie board, beach wear. So one family coming from the 6th floor basically has it to them self going down. Now take the fact that there is no service elevator and the employees must use it........One trip down took 15 minutes (I had no choice as I had the cooler) b. As stated, parking. They may have 75 parking places, problem is, anyone who wants to go to the beach parks at the Grand Seas and hops the wall. After I was forced to park across the street, I walked the parking lot and found exactly 11 cars with tags in the window. I informed Management, and 2 hours later it was the same situation. (Or you can do like the Tiki Bar Manager and park your Yellow Porche directly in front of the front door all weekend?) Since cars could not drive past the front door, get ready to walk to check in! c. As for the room, ours was clean and we really had no complains with the exception of no balcony. (Oh Yea, put 1 hour aside because they make you inventory EVERYTHING!!) #forks, #spoons, # pots, #TV's, #remots...........But the room was clean. I have seen some complaints about sand in the bath room...YOU ARE AT THE BEACH!!!! I was not feeling the tile floors but I could live with that. My suggestion: If your in your 70's, retired and just looking to get away for your 50th year of marriage, OK. If you have kids or looking for things other than a pool, look elsewhere! To be fair, I will not list them here, but I personally know 3 places at Daytona that are cheaper and more \"family\" friendly.

To start: we needed (and requested) a handicap accessible first floor unit for a family member in a wheelchair .About 10 days prior to our arrival, we called Grand Seas to confirm the availability of the unit. We were informed that we could NOT be accomodated, as the accessible first floor units were only available for Saturday check in,not Sunday. We called the resort on May 1 and spoke to a manger who again insisted that they could NOT accomodate us. I should have cancelled at that point and booked the Hilton, but we persisted and Carlos finally agreed to reserve the requested room. Upon check in on May 7, we were informed that although the first floor accessible room WAS booked for us, someone gave it away! The best that they could do was give us a first floor, NON accesible unit..Because it was after 4PM, we had no choice but to accept the unit. The unit, 1044, was down a long narrow hall across from the elevator and trash room. Upon entering the unit, we realized that Grand Seas was not what we are accustomed to. The Kitchen We were greeted with ancient blue countertops that were missing parts of the Formica ,cabinets that the laminate was falling off of, knobs that were falling off, wet,slippery tile floors, and very old,worn utensils. The burners on the stove did not fit properly and they did not even supply wine glasses or an ice bucket. The Living Room Again, wet slippery tile floors, old, worn furniture. Nice french doors with view of ocean. Small TV. Phone that had no dialing instructions--not even for an emergency! The Bathroom Very small room with wet tile and Formica cabinets that were falling apart. Could not fit wheelchair through door, and even if we could, there wasn't any room for it. The Jacuzzi tub/shower had mold growing in the jets and it was not accessible for someone in a wheelchair. The Bedroom One king bed,nightstand,and dresser. Blinds on only window in unit (that every one passing through hall could look into) did not close properly and had no curtain. Worn, musty smelling thin carpet on floor. Could not get wheelchair into room, and there was no room for the chair anyway. Despite trying to dry floor, the kitchen kept getting wet.

I thought that before I cancelled our booking, I would go back to Interval International and tell them what I had read and ask how it was that they rated this a 5 Star resort with these kinds of bad comments from so many travellers. They told me that 85% of Interval International exchangers rated the hotel highly. I then e-mailed the Grand Sesa directly about my concerns. I received an e-mail back promising me that I would have a great vacation, the Front Desk manager would ensure that. How did it go? The location of this hotel is a 10. On the beach and when you arrive it looks great. Front desk check in was smooth and friendly. So far so good, I started to relax. Got parked and then found out that the only elevator in our wing wasn't working - no problem only had to lug suitcases up one set of stairs to the second floor (elevator was never fixed during our stay). Unit we were assigned was recently upgraded, so it looked nice when we walked in. That is where it ended. Within minutes of our arrival all of our feet were black from walking on the floors. The main bathroom was not clean and the toilet in the main bedroom was plugged up. Looked under the bathrom cabinet and had to plunge the toilet myself. I called the Front Desk and asked that the Unit be re-cleaned and that the toilet be fixed. Next morning a service man arrived and uplugged the toilet - cleaners never made it back, so we cleaned the floor ourselves. Next morning when having a shower, the shower backed up so we were standing in 2 inches of water - eeeeeeew! On the pool deck, pools were unheated and so cold the kids couldn't swim in them unitl the 4th day after our arrival - even then it was like an arctic plunge each time you entered - the ocean was warmer. Why could they not heat one pool in the Jan/Feb timeframe. The Pool Bar was never open during our stay. So much for a 5-Star Resort and the amenities they profess to have. They missed our cleaning day and never got unit looked at until our fifth day there. The worst part of the unit was the noise. Every TV, every step, every conversation and every chair dragged across the floor transferred to our unit - it was like the other people were living in our unit. Sleeping was impossible until everyone went to bed after midnight. Then it started early in the morning when people woke up. The construction of this place is horrible. So much for a relaxing restful holiday! The constant parade around the pool of sales people trying to sell this resort to unsuspecting clients was irritating to us while we tried to enjoy the pool and deck area and given our experience there made me want to stand up and scream run - while you can - save yourselves! In my opinion - DO NOT BUY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! I did receive a call from the Front Desk Manager to ask how things were after complaining about the cleaners missing our unit on the Wed, but at that point I couldn't be bothered anymore. Stairs to the beach were dangerous and I would not let my children go down them by themselves. In the end we packed up and left a day early and returned back to the Sheraton In Orlando, upset and feeling misled by both Interval International and the Hotel. This is not a 5-Star resort period. I will be contacting interval International to discuss our holiday with them.

I have never been to Daytona. I have never been to this resort. My family traded in a 5-star Paris Marriott timeshare for our week stay. A week alone to celebrate our anniversary. Booking was difficult, as it is Spring Break time... so we got Daytona and this hotel. We were excited to explore the area and relax. Thanks to the Grand Seas and it's deplorable condition, the week was an absolute nightmare and total waste of time and money. I'm not going to sling mud. I will just spew the facts and have the photos to prove. - Upon our Sunday arrival, 2 of the 3 elevators were broken. We stayed on the extreme North of the hotel. Only the elevator on the extreme SOUTH was working, so it wasn't worth it. Mind you, the elevators were broken until Friday morning. 5 days of up- down up-down with laundry, groceries, and 40 pound suitcases. Not exactly the ideal way to begin a \"relaxing vacation\". - We realized in the middle of our first night, when we were SWEATING to death from the Florida humidity, that the A/C in our condo WASN'T WORKING. The next morning (Mon.) maintenance \"fixed it\". It, once again, stopped working in the middle of Mon. night. This pattern occurred the first FOUR DAYS of our stay until on Wednesday, when it was 85 degrees according to our thermostat and HUMID AS HE** in our room, management finally told us that we had to move units. They couldn't fix it. Would have been NICE to know that a few days earlier before we went to the grocery store or lost several night's sleep due to heat and humidity in our unit?! In addition, HUGE pain re-packing and unpacking EVERYTHING including groceries. FIRST UNIT THAT WE STAYED IN (in ADDITION to the AC not working): Built-in Microwave didn't work so they had a SECOND one sitting on the counter. Toaster didn't function at all. Safe was not attached to the floor properly AND didn't function. Remote control for the TV didn't work. Tub was dirty and not draining properly. SECOND UNIT THAT WE STAYED IN: Tub AGAIN not draining properly. After several run-ins with maintenance that week who had proven to be idiotic and incapable, my husband finally got fed up and found a plunger. He had the sheer delight and honor of removing enormous CLUMPS and CLUMPS of other people's hair so we didn't have to stand ankle-deep in funk every time we showered. If you opt to use the old jacuzzi... be aware THAT'S what you're soaking in. GROSS! Again, the safe didn't work. The A/C of our NEW ROOM stopped working on THURSDAY NIGHT. By that point however, were counting down the MINUTES to our Saturday check-out and didn't bother reporting it. No working TV remote. BOTH ROOMS: HORRIBLY FILTHY. And I am not talking a little. Scuffs on the walls. Film on the windows. Gunk on the baseboards. Paint chipping. Visible dirt on the bedspread. Not to mention, ridiculously high internet charges (hello Starbucks across the street). Total rip off. THE WORST: If you are a guest here, plan that every time your bare feet touch the tile floor... they will be black. Even a quick midnight run 4 feet to the bathroom. We heard SEVERAL other guests complaining about this. We finally bought a box of baby wipes to wipe our feet before getting into bed or putting on our shoes. AROUND THE RESORT: Obviously the elevators were an issue. Doors covered with rust and unmaintained. Roaches and cigarette butts a common sight in the corridors. The steps to the beach are flat-out DANGEROUS. Crumbling, slippery, total hazard. 1/2 of the laundry machines were broken. When we dried our clothes, it took THREE CYCLES ($1.50 a pop) to get our clothes dry. The outdoor pool so cold there's NO way you could enter. One of the hot tubs SO hot, seriously it's dangerous. The Tiki bar was never open. Nothing going on during the day or night, minus a wine and cheese that was actually kind of fun. Plus, the rooms don't have balconies?! This is like the ONLY hotel that doesn't have them in the area. Everyone just stands like prisoners looking out their windows. It's very odd?! OVERALL: If you are accustomed to Marriott (or ANY OTHER REPUTABLE, HABITABLE hotel) quality, do NOT come here. This resort is dirty, unmaintained, and is in need of a TOTAL overhaul. DO NOT ALLOW MARRIOTT TO PLACE YOU HERE AS A TRADE. YOU WILL BE APALLED BY THE QUALITY AND DEFERRED MAINTAINANCE. PLUS, IF YOU WANT ANYTHING OTHER THAN A ROOM THE SIZE OF A CLOSET WITH A MURPHY BED... YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PAY FOR A $100 UPGRADE!! We talked to many guests. The only people HAPPY at the Grand Seas are those who, seriously, don't know better. This IS a nice hotel to them?! They have never been to a 4 or 5 star hotel. They will overlook dirt and grime and broken appliances. The management responses on this site are laughable. I have BEEN THERE and seen it for my OWN EYES. The only work being done while I was there was to the roof of the Tiki Bar thingie that WASN'T EVEN OPEN?! And mind you, they blessed all of the guests with the BANGING of these repairs at 8:30 in the MORNING. Hope that you weren't planning to sleep-in guests?! A working elevator would have been nice instead?! ~roll eyes~ I feel as though when staying at a timeshare or hotel for that matter: appliances should work, the rooms should be clean, and guests should be comfortable. If you agree, then PLEASE do NOT stay here. You will be extremely disappointed. The Grand Seas ensured that our anniversary getaway was stressful, tiring, and disappointing.

I had read that the rooms were dirty, but we did not find this so. The rooms were very spacious, but if you plan on any kids or teens sleeping on the floor, beware, the floors are all hard tile. We stayed in a one bedroom/one bath room. The bedroom was clean and had a nice big tv. We wondered if we could have taken our dvd player with us to this unit (because we didnt want to rent movies from the hotel for $14.00 a night), and yes, a dvd player would have worked. There is also a Blockbuster Video directly across the street! The livingroom was clean and had a good size tv there also. The kitchen was lacking a bit because obviously the hotel must have had problems with utensils and bowls, plates, etc walking away. There were four people in our unit, therefore, there were 4 bowls, 4 plates, 4 cups...you get the picture here. The pool area was nice, but if you forget to return the towels to the fitness room, you will be charged 10.00 per towel, I thought that was a little steep. There was also a charge for 1.47 a day for nothing at all. We asked the front desk clerk what that was for, she told us that she didnt know and that she was sorry if we had not been told about the charge. The internet there is 4.95 an hour, like most of the area hotels. The putt putt there was pretty decent for a hotel course and there was no fee for that either. One thing that I did like was the staff there was very courteous, they had alot of fun things going on for smaller children. They also had a game room that was better than I thought it would be that was perfect for teens. It had a pool table, ice hockey game, several pinball games, some shooting games, and a dance game. They also have a ice cream machine in that room. The location of this hotel couldnt have been better though. Right across the street was a Publix grocery store, Blockbuster Video, Subway, a Chinese Restraunt, a Bowling alley, Starbucks Coffee, Quizno Subs, and some good shopping (Foot Locker, Dots, etc.). Right down in front of the hotel (on the beach) was a guy that rented 4 wheelers by the hour. Overall, I think this was a nice, inexpensive place to stay. If you are with small children (ages up to 8), this location would be perfect for you. If I was going on my honeymoon, its not the most elaborate or romantically decorated choice.

We also had a bottom floor room on another stay and the patio door didn't lock from the outside so you had to walk out the front and all the way around to the pool if you wanted your room locked. It didn't lock well from the inside which we notified maintenance about but they never came.

We were fine with that, 4 nights for $50 was no problem and we received that money as soon as the presentation was over. The problem was the presentation. First, the presentation was for the Grand Seas Resort but our acccomdations were in the Palm Plaza Hotel, miles down the street. Once we got there, there was a young black guy by the name of Jimmie. My husband turned to me and said \"I bet you money they give him us\". My husband and I are young african americans (26 & 29) and they must have figuired this is someone we could relate to. Wrong! He comes out all loud and swinging his necklace talking about that bling. bling crap. He walks us around the presentation room and back to the big room where they make all their deals. He preceeds to tell us he makes $400,000 year, he does this time share thing on the side, how is likes meeting people on myspace.com lalalala, etc. After about 15 mins of talking about himself, some other man comes over with the break-down of the contract and they walk away so that we can talk amongst ourselves. I turned to my husband and said \" I still don't know crap about Club Naviago\" Finally we decided to purchase a 'preview package'. Later that night we got back to our hotel room and starting reading all the information they had given us and realized that were a lot of stuff they never mentiononed. Since we had so many questions, we had to write them down to make sure we didn't forget. The next morning, we drove down to the Grand Seas to have breakfast and get some answers. Besides the fact that there was pieces of paper in my waffle, this day Jimmie had the nerve to insult my intellience by telling me I didn't need to read, that's were the problem is. He keeps telling us that we don't need to worry about anything, just call him and he will handle everything. During this whole conversation is was touring with another black couple. After me and my husband went to tour their other property The Cove at Ormond Beach and was still not impressed we decided to cancel our contract. You have 10 days to cancel all contracts and receive a full refund. We took all the materials back to the Club Navigo preview center and said thanks but no thanks. Later that night we ran into the couple the was touring earlier that day and they informed us that once we got in the car Jimmy talked about my husband and I so bad it turned them off and they decided not to purchase.

I called Grand Seas Resort management to see if I could get them to pay one or both change fees - I knew it was only a slight chance of it.

That means you can use any week of the year you wish, so they would be putting you in whatever unit is available for the week you requested.

We usually stay at a hotel (not fancy ones) but with my brother buying into a timeshare at the Grand Seas - we all thought we would try it. This year we had 4 families going down. First off - none of us were able to get any great deals because of my brother's ownership at the Grand Seas. I was able to obtain three rooms through a broker - did get a great deal. I had no problems with check-in - we were even able to check in 3 hours early. The room was a little disappointing. We were hoping for a bigger kitchen - like the pictures on the internet - didn't complain though because we really liked the size of the unit. We had two bedrooms and two baths. The floor is all ceramic tile - hard to keep clean so I went out and bought myself some flip flop slippers to keep my feet clean. The resort has three pools - one indoor and two outdoor, plus a kiddie pool at three hot tubs. The slide at the big pool was broken - hear that it's been that way for a while. I did overhear maintenance that they ordered a new slide and it should arrive within two weeks. We were there for two weeks and it never happened. Then I heard that it was always broken. Kids didn't complain at all though. Music is played each day at the pool - kids enjoyed the DJ on Sundays - he keeps everyone entertained and has contests such as belly flops, hulla hoop, trivia - etc. Other DJs just played music and sometimes it was quite loud - you could not carry on a conversation with the person next to you. The resort has a gym that is pretty good. Several eliptical machines, treadmills and weight machines - more equipment than what most hotels have. The resort also has a tiki bar outside and a restaurant that you can order food poolside. Food was great and so were the drinks ordered - the kids even had kiddie drinks. There is also a jungle gym outside for the kids - they really enjoyed that too. Parking was difficult on the weekends as the resort was more crowded but we were always able to get a space. We didn't seem to mind that housekeeping only came on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It was strange having to exchange your linens/towels each day on your own - but we got used to it. The resort does not have balconies but the windows are floor to ceiling so you could still enjoy the ocean - the dolphins were plenty this year. I also felt that no balcony was safer due to the little kids in our party. I know that is a downside for some people - but it didn't matter to us. Loved having Publix, Walgreens, Dots, Bealls - all across the street. Very convenient. We did have an extra visitor the last two nights - my husband was finally able to kill it the last night and the exterminator came the day we left - but that is life in Florida. We really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Seas. It was a different experience for us since we have never stayed at a timeshare resort - but all and all - it was pretty nice. I have stayed at five star resorts before - this is not one of them. It's a great place for families - be prepared for crowds on the weekends but by Tuesday things seem to settle down.

Infact if the owners aren't happy they should get together and complain and if all else fails they should seek legal action. After all aren't the owners paying good money for up keep and remodeling? Also I would not have bought if I had been told that this was the only property available. In fact if you really want a timeshare look to the resale market, that is where the deals are, and you can shop around too... As for our tour we only wanted tickets, but once they knew we owned a timeshare they befriended us, and then over the next six hours they cut down our Westgate Lakes property telling us that we needed to buy with them. In the end they wore my husband down, because he had a bad headache, and he missed my dropped hints that we should leave... I was then ganged-up-on by the closing staff and our agent who kept trying to assure me that this was a good deal. I finally caved when the manager vowed he wasn't going to leave until we were happy and he closed the deal! Well I'm Not happy. And \"Thank God\" for the ten day right of recession, which will cancel this mistake. I ONLY HOPE THAT FLORIDA WILL KEEP THIS OPTION AVAILABLE TO THOSE OF US WHO JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NO! Finally the State of Florida should take a long hard look at these timeshares, regarding code 721. For they {timeshares} make it sound like they can't take advantage of you, but in reality they are for you are led to believe that if you say NO you will loose the deal forever. This code is also being used in a deceptive way for they make it sound like the State of Florida is keeping them honest with these regulations. But\" how can this be fair or benefit people when in fact this just prevents you from being able to shop around for the best deals out there? Good Luck. Nancy P.S Oh if you want to tour a timeshare for the tickets we have been told by some \"Timeshare Pro's\" these tips. Hope you can use them where we failed. 1. Tell them you are not interested in buying and that you have just come for the gift, and you have agreed to see their property. 2. Don't get into long conversations; if you disclose an interest in traveling this will only give them more ammunition to use against you so that they can go in for the kill. tip {say you don't intend to travel that much, or You stay with friends, or that You like hotels because you feel that there will always be cheap hotels to stay in.} 3. Take a watch, and if the tour is getting too long and drawn out; tell them you will only stay for the ninety minutes, and that you expect your gift regardless of what has been done.

We hated the tile floors in the living and dining area. Yes, they do make your socks/feet dirty no matter how much you sweep or clean them. We had no problem with other areas of cleanliness. The kitchen area was somewhat well equipped considering we bring some cookware from home. It looked to have a newer fridge. The baseboards were not only rotting, but parts of them were broken off. You would think that would be something easy to replace considering the annual fees that owners at this resort pay. The Gilligans Grill is just so so and below average. We only ate there the first night because we were so tired from driving and had to stand in line 45 - 50 mins (after 4:00 pm) to register. They said they had \"computer problems\".

He said he would look through the security tapes and get back with me and I never heard from him the rest of the week. The sad thing is, when I went down to report the break-in, another guest was in his office complaining, so I had to wait. And throughout the week, I overheard many unhappy people with the resort. Luckily, we traded from a time share in Orlando, so we were not out much money. I just can't imagine my frustration had I paid good money to stay in such a dump! I will say that Daytona Beach is beautiful. We had a wonderful time. Stay somewhere else to eliminate all the hassles, just don't ruin your vacation by staying at the Grand Seas Resort!", "Date": "June 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWould return\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1559795", "Content": "I bought a time share unit.

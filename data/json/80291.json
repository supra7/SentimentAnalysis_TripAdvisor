How can Hilton put their name on this?\u201d", "Author": "dlabrake", "ReviewID": "UR126690506", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I'm a big fan of Hilton. Usually, the Hilton name, regardless of the type of brand that falls under their umbrella means you will have a quality stay. This is not the case with this property. I have never heard such dreadful sounds come out of pipes all night long. The sound was so loud, even when the bathroom door was shut it woke me up no less than 6-7 times throughout the night. Three nights in a row. I had read previous posts about this but I had also read positive posts that never mentioned it so I thought I would give them a try. Afterall, it is a Hilton property, how bad could it be? The walls are so thin you can hear the conversations in the room next to you. Not just noise...but the actual conversation. This past weekend the hotel was pretty full so you couldn't switch rooms. The guests on one side of me were out for a good part of the night and when they got back to their room, they stayed up talking. Not partying, just talking. You should be allowed to talk in your room, afterall you paid for it, right? I had to ask them several times to stop at 3am, 4am and 5am because I needed my sleep. This took place three nights in a row. I never left a hotel so tired. The decor is average, the lobby is very modern and the shuttle service was just ok. I asked for a 6am ride to the airport the night before and I was told they would be ready at 6am for me. It was actually 6:15 when they were ready. You may want to allow yourself a little extra time. The shuttle drivers were very friendly and apologized for not being ready at 6am. The property had a dining area and a gift shop as well as a pool and jacuzzi. All were very good. Overall, I base a hotel on cleanliness and sleep quality.

Staff - the staff were friendly and helpful. The cookies were quite the treat. The Okay Location - on the outskirts of downtown San Diego - it is a 15 minute walk into the Gaslamp District. However, you do walk by some seedier parts of downtown to get to the Gaslamp, so in the evening, we ended up taking a cab back to the hotel rather than walking. Parking Garage - as most people have already pointed out, the garage has extremely tight turns. I drive a Toyota Prius, so it wasn't as big a problem. However, I am not sure how people with larger cars, SUV's, trucks, etc. can get around those tight corners. Also, parking is expensive at $22/night, although you do get in and out privileges. Bathroom - there was something weird going on with the plumbing, because whenever you used the sink, the drain in the bathtub would start making funny noises. The hotel is clearly older, although they have done well to refurbish the decor of the rooms. Bad Thin Walls - we were awoken at 2am in the morning (and my wife was kept awake for the next hour or two) by (a) people in the hallway coming back from a night of drinking, (b) our neighbor's alarm clock going off for 30 minutes, (c) our neighbor watching TV at God-awful volumes, (d) our neighbors having a drunken argument, and (e) someone in the next room vomiting.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for families\u201d", "Author": "nkcanada", "ReviewID": "UR125808722", "Content": "Stayed one night in the hotel located 10 minutes from the airport while passing through.

Its worth a 10 point decrease on the blood pressure meter to me when I visit. The people are friendly, The streets are clean, restaurants of high quality and there's always something to do. The Double tree hotel embodies these qualities. From my room 9 with a small balcony, I could see the harbor and the masts of the Star of India, a sailing ship from the early 20th century. The location of the hotel, just a few blocks from the Little Italy Quarter, easy walking distance to the Harbor and gaslight district make it a great base of operations for a San Diego visit. The light rail system is close by so there's little to want for. The hotel staff is friendly and attentive, beds are comfortable and the rooms a decent size. a good value overall. They also have a large pool and Jacuzzi that are perfect after a long day. The breakfast buffet was extensive and reasonably priced, but there are a few little places for a light breakfast or lunch in the area as well for the budget minded. The only caution is if you have a car and need to use the garage. Try not to panic when you see the narrow, walled ramps between the levels. it OK for a Fiat 500, but if your driving an American midsized car or larger, you may have to plan your maneuvers more carefully; Think landing on the deck of one of the Aircraft Carriers in the harbor if you want to avoid a \"body rash\"on your car.

My husband and son came along and they were going to sight-see while I worked. The suite was a good size, but there was no door and therefore no privacy between the master bedroom area and the living room sofa bed area. My husband liked how large the room was and the quality of the furnishings. The bathroom featured a jacuzzi tub with a shower head looming over the tub - it didn't look safe and showering was awkward at best. There was one small sink and for a large bathroom, it could have been two sinks or a larger sink for the space. There was one bathrobe in the closet and there should have been two. There was no refrigerator, but we made a call to the front desk and one was brought up. My son had brought his Xbox to play games in the evenings. The TV uses a closed circuit which means we had to hack the TV in order for him to get a channel to play on and he couldn't connect to XBox Live because the internet service has not been set up for game play. If you bring a DVD player with you when you travel, you also would not be able to play DVDs on the flat screen TV unless you know how to hack it. We did call an engineer in and he was pretty useless. We knew more about what was going on than he did. My son was extremely disappointed, to say the least. It appears that the hotel expects you to pay for movies and does everything to discourage anyone who brings in their own equipment for entertainment. The parking garage is a bit stressful to drive in, the passageways are quite narrow and if you are driving anything larger than a sub-compact, be extremely careful. I am not sure if the structure meets code. We swam in the pool and used the jacuzzi (located on the fifth floor). Both were clean and in good working order. The room was extremely noisy due to the HVAC system. We were kept awake by the air conditioning system from the room next to us. My husband and I aren't used to a lot of ambient noise at night, so it doesn't take much to keep us up. Some people might not have been bothered by it. We ate in the restaurant (located off the lobby) one evening. Prices were reasonable for a hotel restaurant in the $10 to $15 range for entrees. Food was decent, but nothing worth raves. My husband ordered a burger. My son ordered a chicken sandwich. I had a fresh beet salad. The fresh beets came from a can and the walnuts overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients, but the portion size was large. Service was uneven. Our water was filled regularly, but the food service was slow - especially since the room was less than half-full. The actual location of the hotel was unremarkable. There are no restaurants or shopping close by and we had to drive to the convention center due to the distance. Last time I had attended a conference here, I had stayed at the Hilton next door to the Convention Center and it was a better choice, but that Hilton was a lot more expensive for a suite. For a two room - king size bed and sofa bed, it was $242 per night plus an additional $20 for parking our rental car. There was no breakfast included, although you can get fresh cookies daily and a US Today. Next time, since we had to drive to get anywhere any way, I might pick an Embassy Suites away from the downtown or convention area.

When I went to my car in the morning, there was a sign saying I didn't display a pass and my car would be towed if I didn't move it. When I ran to the desk requesting a pass they seemed like 'oh well, here's a pass.' There is no sign stating you need a pass, and I assumed you needed your key card to exit the lot but this isn't needed....They just come around and look for parking passes - so make sure you get one. 2. I stayed in 1703, which had a connecting door. Whatever you do, DON'T take this room. Can't say whether it was this specific room or whether all rooms in the hotel are like this but I could hear every breath the guy in the next room took. In fact, while laying one bed at night I found myself laughing at a joke that was on his TV! The connecting doors are paper thin and I don't think he was overly loud because I could hear every sniffle he took. Overall, it was a typical Doubletree.

It's on the side of the freeway where you can walk to Little Italy and the Gaslamp District easily ... as opposed to, for instance, the Holiday Inn. In fact, being on the off-ramp didn't pose any real inconveniences, except that when we exited the freeway, we drove past the hotel before we started reading address numbers to find it. To have a hotel so close to the freeway is a little off-putting, but did not break my experience.

We're leaving?\" He said he wanted them to know that they had a problem and didn't want the next guest to encounter it. The employee responded by saying that they were working on the plumbing in the entire hotel and hadn't gotten to our floor yet. Lastly, we were attending a seminar that weekend in a ballroom inside of the hotel. At one point, the workers were really loud behind the walls. They quieted when someone in our group went back there to alert them. Otherwise, we had a great time in downtown San Diego. The hotel does not leave a bad taste. I would say it delivers on quality, but the hiccups in the experience make it just miss the mark for me.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, although some noise\u201d", "Author": "JATB", "ReviewID": "UR121841758", "Content": "The Doubletree by Hilton Downtown is what you'd expect from a 333 room, high-rise hotel - business centric and functional.

It featured 40\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat panel televisions, new furniture, and a new bathroom vanity. In most respects it felt like a modern hotel.

Personnel: Every staff member that we encountered was friendly and helpful\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially in the restaurant. Each time we had a question or special request we were more than satisfied by the kind attention we received. Restaurant: This hotel has one restaurant which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Unlike most of our other trips we ate breakfast and dinner on site. The breakfast buffet, which featured all the usual fare, was competitively priced when compared to other San Diego hotels. Dinners were priced closer to traditional hotel pricing (a poor value). Our only complaint regarding the restaurant concerned the lighting in the high-ceiling areas. Those fixtures used cheap fluorescent lights which gave me a headache and reduced the visual appeal of their food. The booth seating, under an overhang, had incandescent light fixtures\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwithout the headache. Lastly, other reviewers have commented on the narrowness of the parking garage. Although I was skeptical I now believe them. The minivan we rented barely fit on the ramps between floors, and the parking spots themselves were narrower than the ramps. Making this situation worse were the reserved parking spots for hotel staff. It seemed that the widest and easiest to access spots on every floor of the garage were reserved for the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees or managers.

The hotel is located close to the airport and Little Italy but a bit removed from the convention center area. That wasn't a huge deal since a taxi to the conference was only $8.00. Got a room on the 19th floor which had a gorgeous view of the harbor. However, the hotel was inconsistent in a number of ways. First, the Internet service was really, really poor. As it turns out, you had to ask the front desk for the \"upgraded\" service for it to be useful for anything but basic email. No one ever told me this nor was any in-room information provided in this regard. Asked them to open up the bandwidth for me and was told they'd do so, but never got anything faster than 0.4 Mbps. I had a number of hours available before the conference started each day but could not get much work done due to the painfully slow connection speeds. Next, the plumbing in this facility was very strange. Anytime an adjoining room (or room above you) used their sink, shower or toilet, my plumbing made loud gurgling noises for about five minutes afterwards. Does this even meet local building codes? I have stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms and this was a first. Speaking of adjoining rooms, the privacy between rooms was non-existant. Honestly, I could hear every single word being spoken on the phone by the person in the next room. This was creepy and definitely is something that the hotel needs to fix and do so soon. The person next to me was obviously staying there by herself. I can't imagine what else I might have heard in other circumstances! The location was acceptable. The room was clean.

You can also take an easy 5 minute stroll to the streetcar and catch an easy ride on San Diego's excellent trolley system to get to Old Town. The location might seem a little scary.

But absolutely no one bothered me and, during the three days I was there, no one ever approached me. I did a lot of walking (the official conference hotel was about a mile or so away, and I always took advantage of the beautiful weather and used my feet to go back and forth), and never had a problem.

Pros: Low price (through Priceline bidding process), friendly staff, free internet, wonderful views, very short walk to little Italy (great food!), short drive to gaslamp, old town, and all attractions (Seaworld, Zoo, Petco park, etc.). Cons: $22/night parking, strange parking garage lay-out (use the mirrors they provide or else you literally can't see around the ramps). Other: Average sized rooms. A/C was adequate... but never got the room quite as cool as I'd like.

Good news is that you can park on the street for free on the weekends......beats the $22 they were asking for.

The hotel is conveniently located downtown, just a couple of miles from the airport, so it's a really quick hop between the two. The public spaces are updated and felt modern and comfortable. The lobby was a little dark because of the way the lobby is set in the building's footprint. But the check-in desks had a chic up-to-date feeling. There was a water feature in the lobby, which I rather liked. The restaurant and bar areas also felt very updated and were nice. The rooms were basic: clean, comfortable, and okay. A really nice bonus was the balcony and spectacular view of the skyline and water. It wasn't really big enough to do anything other than just step out for a look, but that's a big plus over what most hotels offer in the way of a balcony. One odd thing, though, was the room's coffee station, which was dead in the way.

It took twenty minutes or so before it turned up. On the way back out, I was told that it departed every fifteen minutes. This wasn't my experience at all. I waited for about 25 minutes before the front desk finally called--and paid for--a taxi. Kudos to the hotel for offering to foot the bill for the taxi (it was extended as an offer, without my prompting), but they really should make sure that this important amenity is toward the top of their priority list.

I never heard anything back from anyone about the problem. And during the entire stay, I stood in foot deep water while I showered.

This is my first stay in San Diego. I did some research, read some alarming reviews about the noises, still, I decided to book here because of the location. First of all, the CSR that I called to book the hotel had some attitude problem when I made a request such as upgrading from double twins bed to king bed and etc. Then I was told to enroll in HH account which she gave me an account number but later I found out that the account isn't active so I would get no credit for my stay. Needless to say that CSR was a [--] with an attitude problem. When I came to the hotel, I got my room and everything was ok. The noise from the AC isn't that bad, it does sound like somebody opens your door when it turns on. Anyway, another problem with this hotel is the attitude of the waiters at the Ariana restaurant. The waiters expect you to tip them for everything, even \"take out / togo\" orders. They seem to think that they get paid for standing there and doing nothing. If they have to ring up your order, you are expected to give them a BIG TIP, $2 for togo tip isn't good enough. They won't even look at you the next time they see you if you don't give them TIPs. How pathetic. I don't really understand how the waiters expect to get tip for bringing food from the kitchen to outside doing no extra service that deserving of tip. This attitude problem from the waiters has to change. Especially, the food from the hotel is so horrible and expensive. For the same price, you can go out and buy the same food at half price that the hotel charges. Another thing about this hotel is the narrow parking garage. It is literally NARROW so watch out your speed and make sure you drive very slow in there. The room overall is decent, NOT super clean or new., just standard. Overall I would give a C = 3 stars for everything about this hotel. However, they charges a little over price I believe they charge the price of a 4-star hotel when they are only about 3-star hotel.

The asking price (rack rate) was $209, which seems excessive to me given the location and facilities of this hotel. The Priceline rate was considerably less and made for a good value stay. So, if you can get a discount, this would be a good place to stay. The hotel has been recently redecorated and the guest rooms are attractively furnished as are the bathrooms. Beds have comfortable pillow-top mattresses. A small observation: the in-room coffee maker is unlike any other I have seen in hotel rooms, and I liked it. I generally avoid using hotel coffee makers because the brown liquid that they dispense is not worth drinking, at least not for my tastes. But this is not the case at the Doubletree; the Wolfgang Puck-branded coffee and the unique style coffee maker made for a decent cup of coffee. I had read about the noise problem here on Tripadvisor, so I requested, and was given, a room facing south, away from the airport & highway. Noise was not an issue for us. We particularly liked the balcony. It is rare to have an urban hotel room with windows that open let alone a balcony. This balcony was greatly appreciated and added value to my stay. In-room Wi-Fi access is free to guests. As others have noted, they will provide you with warm cookies at check-in, and they will be happy to give you additional cookies on other nights if it appears that they will have \"extras\". The location is on the outskirts of downtown, which may not appeal to some travelers, but I came to prefer this location because it made the hotel more accessible. On the weekend, I was able to park on the street and avoid the $20/night garage fee. This might not have been possible at a downtown property. It's a subtle point, but It seems fair to say that the Doubletree has hotel facilities but with an easy \"motel-style\" access. I got over my initial apprehension about not being in the downtown core, and came to prefer this peripheral location in the \"Little Italy\" neighborhood. It was interesting to read a previous poster's comment about the mechanical noise made by the air conditioning sytem when it turns on or off - we experienced the same noise, and it was indeed annoying.

The hotel still needs to invest in modern windows and patio doors to provide the quiet and peace one would expect of a hotel in this price range. The interior decor of the room was pleasant, but there are some basic maintenance issues that are still in dire need of attention, namely plumbing and electrical. The diverter in the shower was so bad that you had to wrench the handle to stop the flow of water. Even then, the water would start to drip after a while. I'm sure the city of San Diego doesn't appreciate the wasted water. There were two light fixtures that did not work and one outlet that wouldn't work either.

I paid $18 to have raisan bran and fruit delivered to my room. Annoying. I WILL NOT book a room here again and WOULD NOT recommend it to a friend. If you are not a light sleeper, this hotel is nice. - noisy AC...whenever it would shut off, it would make this super loud \"bang\" and scare the crap out of me. As you can tell, I am the worst sleeper! (I even had a sound with me and ear plugs, by the way, but they did not mask the hotel noises). Try the Westin which is a few blocks away. It looks really nice and it's in the middle of the Gas Lamp shopping area and has no major roads are around it.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!\u201d", "Author": "psmoove", "ReviewID": "UR17823100", "Content": "Our family loved this hotel. 3 miles to Balboa Park/San Diego Zoo, and very modern furnishings and contemporary lobby.

The Best Western and Holiday Inn were full and the Doubletree wasn't. Rooms were around $200 each per night. Our rooms were on the 16th floor, overlooking the freeway, airport and school sports field. I think they were refurbished as they were more modern looking than those pictured on this site; everything felt new and the fixtures and fittings were of a high standard. The beds were remarkably comfortable - my wife insisted I take pictures of the pillow labels so we could buy the same make on our return home! We found the service to be generally good, although it did not seem to be possible to get help with the bags (nobody turned up on both the occasions we requested help). The car park is a very tight squeeze to exit if you have a large vehicle (we were driving a Ford Expedition and just managed to get out). The bar and restaurant lacked atmosphere, although were good enough for a final drink before bedtime. There are plenty of good restaurants around and about, however, so this isn't a problem. There are a couple of stores within a 5 minute walk (down towards the sea front) along with coffee shops and a variety of restaurants (sushi, Italian, Delis, etc). You can hear the freeway clearly at night, although this was compensated by the great view of the airport, freeway and harbour. Although we live in a rural location and normally have no traffic noise at home this wasn't a bother at all. In summary, we found the Doubletree a very comfortable hotel. There are a couple of issues with service and the car park, but we would stay here again without hesitation.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "long beach, ca", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Christypix", "ReviewID": "UR14671626", "Content": "I got a good goverment rate on this hotel ($110 on a fri) so i had to prioritize what was important to me. Obviously the price was a big deal. I have stayed at hotel solimar, hyatt, and hilton and those hotels are very nice compared to the doubletree but they are also more expensive. The location of the doubletree was a bit to far north for me. I personally like to walk out of the hotel and be directly where the action is.... but I took a cab ($5) down to the gaslamp district and when we went to the padre game the shuttle bus took us to Petco for no charge, just tip of course (they were very nice). When you enter the hotel lobby was average, small, not flashy but clean. Seems like a lot of people that stay there are there for business. There is a free shuttle to the airport and the airport isn't too far. We stayed on the six floor and the hallway we stayed at kind of smelled funny, I dont know if it use to be a smoking floor or what?.. The room was a good size, quiet, clean and had comfortable down blankets. If you are a light sleeper the airconditioning went on all night... so that humming sound might anoy you. The pool area was very nice. The pool is small with a jacuzzi. It looked like they just got new pool furniture and it had comfortable chairs and cabanas. It was pretty empty... don't expect any poolside service its not that kind of hotel. The gym was small but had all the necessities that you need to work out.

The best parking spot was reserved for a Porsche SUV that belonged to the management...handicapped people had to walk further. The free newspapers were non-existent. There was old food around the pool in the morning with plenty of bird droppings. The exercise equipment was missing important parts. We were compensated with a free breakfast. It was beyond horrible. There was water spilled under the toaster. The food in the warming trays was overcooked and the selection was not vegan friendly. We left a sports coat there and when we went back to housekeeping they had placed in a plastic grocery sack. Don't even think of driving a large vehicle into the hotel parking lot. The tight turns and the damaged concrete speak of the dangers of this. It took a month, several emails, and phone calls to get some service.

The shower had good water pressure, and was stocked with plenty of towels and other niceties such as lotion and two kinds of soap.

I asked the 'concierge' if he knew where the shuttle would be to the wedding (something I would think he would at least be aware of, even if it was a private shuttle, since many many hotel guests were taking it) and he had absolutely no idea, and made no effort to find out for us. Another thing that bothered me about this hotel was there is no mini-fridge. It seems most hotels these days offer that, if you want to chill some water, soda, beer, etc. The pool area was nice, albeit windy. We decided that they should move the bar that is currently in the restaurant in the lobby to the 5th floor pool, because there is some great furniture up there, and it looks like it could even be a 'scene', with little cabanas, etc. But it was sort of quiet and boring in the pool area, and I think it had some potential.

First the good news. The actual property, rooms and location are great. I would go so far as to say that the rooms are a great value since they are brand new with the Doubletree bed, a great balcony (but if you're a light sleeper, the traffic noise from the 5 might be a bit much), the biggest tray of bath amenities I've ever seen (and I'm a Hilton HHonors Diamond!) and free internet (a rarity in full-service hotels). Parking is reasonable at $18 a day in a covered garage. The walk downtown isn't far and Little Italy is right next door. The pool on the fifth floor is also really cool as it looks out over the city and the bay. I'm also a big fan of their little Wolfgang Puck coffeemaker, its a nice touch and makes great coffee. So. like I said the actual hotel itself is pretty good, if not great. I also recommend the little gelateria a block west of the hotel. Best gelato and coffee I've had outside of Italy; they also have a nice pastry selection. Now the bad news. Guests and employees of this hotel almost make it unbearable! I suspect the Doubletree kept many of the Radisson hotel's employees, as a result, they don't know policy. I had to argue with the front desk MANAGER about whether or not I got free breakfast. I asked another one to recommend a restaurant in Little Italy and they recommended a local chain! When I asked if they could make reservations, they said \"no\" and when I asked for their phone number, he said they didn't have it! I expect answers like that from employees new to the hotel or industry, but a manager?! On the weekdays, the hotel fills largely with business people and the staff actually appears to act more professional! I guess that's because on weekends, the hotel fills with families and people looking \"to party\" and they're relieved that those people are gone. Which brings me to the guests. I spent 3 weekend nights at the property and felt like I was at a frat house! Between the parties and the screaming kids, this otherwise nice business hotel goes nuts! When I checked out early on a Saturday, the police had just kicked out a sizable number of guests from the hotel for drunk and disorderly conduct!

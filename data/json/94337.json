We usually stay at Ritz-Carlton hotels wherever we travel, but opted to try something new on our trip to Boston. The XV was good, but not exceptional .We are willing to pay for a truly awesome experience and felt like we did, but just received a good experience. Nothing was wrong, but nothing was truly great. We did have an issue with the temperature and asked it be addressed upon our return from a day out. Our room was still sweltering upon our return and we again asked that it be taken care of. They kept asking us if we had the fireplace on. Duh! No! We couldn't even use the fireplace, although it was chilly out because the room was a sauna! The maintenance guy came, looked, and offered to open the window and bring a fan. Not what I expected for the money we paid. The car service was nice. We took it to the Garden, but they couldn't pick us up because they had other people to pick up, they said. No one greeted us when we entered and exited, other than the door man. Our room was very cute and I liked the furnishing. Bed was nice, pillows were either too over stuffed or under stuffed, no in between. It was very central for the park and shopping and there's a great Irish pub just across the street. We ate sushi down the street also, and it was lovely. Overall, again, nothing was terrible or bad.

Funny enough, my boyfriend and I had a conversation earlier that day that good customer service seems to be non-existent everywhere. We were pleasantly surprised by our amazing stay at the XV Beacon. First of all, I had contacted them on facebook saying \"can't wait to stay with you this weekend to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday\" They responded and said they were looking forward to our stay. Upon our arrival, two men came out from the building, dressed very nicely and classy. One of them opened our doors of our car, the other unloaded our luggage onto the cart. They took our car for valet, and escorted us to the front desk. Once at the front desk, we checked in and the man working there was extremely helpful with all the details of our stay and services available to us. We then saw the concierge who booked a Lexus for us to take (it's complimentary!) to our dinner in the North End. Were escorted to our rooms and our luggage was unloaded. Once in our room, the bell hop showed us all the awesome things in our room, which included a gas fireplace, stereo system, in room dining, mini bar and the privacy light (no crazy signs to put on the door). Another man, who appears to take care of guest requests and room service, appeared during this time and brought us a few snacks complimentary. This included a chocolate dipped strawberry, chocolate dipped apricot, chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal cookie with crasins in it. Ice was immediately fetched for us upon our request. Within a few minutes, they came to our door again with a special chocolate cake and waters as well as a card wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday. I was very impressed!! I hadn't even requested this and they remembered my facebook post! We went downstairs to get our car for dinner and the driver was waiting in the lobby for us. We took a spacious and comfortable Lexus SUV and it was nice ride to the restaurant. The car service does only run until 11pm, but they will call cabs for you as needed. The room itself, was beautiful! Not much of a view (we were on the 2nd floor) but the gas log fireplace was awesome, the stereo was great and had speakers in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable as were the chairs in the room. There was a safe in the closet and plenty of area for storage if you were there for a long stay. The mini bar was by far the most impressive on I've ever seen. Everything from gourmet snacks, comfort food, varieties of wine, champagne, hard liquor, water juice and coconut water. The bathroom was very clean and beautiful! The rain shower head was amazing and the jetted tub was treat in the morning before we started our day. A newspaper of our choice was delivered for us the next day and they remembered our room and names during check out! I was so impressed that everyone here is so detail oriented! Our bags were placed in the car for us and the car was brought up to wait for us, while we enjoyed a delicious and leisurely brunch at Mooo... next door. Overall, one amazing weekend in the best hotel I've ever stayed in. This will now be my new go to hotel for when I stay in Boston with your great service, excellent staff and a beautiful hotel in a great location!

The decision to go with XV Beacon was made based on the fact that we were travelling up from New York where we had stayed 12 days at the Marriott Marquis over Christmas & New Years. What we were after was a smaller, quieter & more boutique style hotel. What we discovered in XV Beacon though, was a hidden gem. It all started with contacting the Concierge from their website prior to our arrival (about 2 months). I was after recommendations for great restaurants in the area and also appropriate tours of inner-city Boston which would give us a real sense of what Boston had to offer. The Concierge's name was Jonathan. I cannot praise Jonathan enough for all the work & attention he put in to my requests. He listened & his local knowledge was brilliant. The recommendations were exactly what i was looking for and as a result we booked all the restaurants for each night along with a couple of the tours he recommended (for anyone looking / interested there is a 'North End Tour' that i would highly recommend which will give you a great sense of the food culture & history in Boston's North End.) Jonathan also helped in sourcing tickets for both a local NBA & NHL game for the time that we were there. Considering all of the above was discussed & confirmed over email and prepared before my arrival (including the tickets for both the NBA & NHL which were delivered and ready to go at the Hotel) needless to say my expectations were well and truly exceeded by this stage. Jonathan's attention to detail and ability to help the guests queries 100% of the time was a clear standout for this brilliant Hotel. Both Michael & Molly (whom are the other two Concierge's there were also incredibly good to deal with, very helpful and very knowledgeable) Upon arrival to XV Beacon we used the complimentary car service to collect us from 'South Station'. A fantastic feature provided by the Hotel which we used as much as possible to help in getting us around Boston to either dinner reservations or sports games! This was as easy as calling the hotel 10 minutes before the train arrived into South Station and the car was waiting and ready to collect us. The driver we mainly had was a chap by the name of Chris who was absolutely brilliant. He gave us some great local information and insight into Boston and also helped in giving us feedback for some of the things we had already booked. The rooms at XV Beacon were simply stunning. Generous on space, well appointment & fantastic amenities. These alone will guarantee the perfect stay. The Hotel's layout was very appropriate for both its location and size which gave us as guests a very warm welcoming upon arrival. The style in which XV Beacon had been decorated gave a certain charm you don't often find these days in hotels. I have been fortunate to have travelled alot both personally and with work, XV Beacon to date has been the best experience of my travelling life on all levels. A World Class Hotel that will both guarantee a deliver a truly magnificent stay / experience.

From months before our arrival (about twelve people coming to town) the concierge helped me plan a weekend of events to surprise my wife.

In addition to the hotel restaurant, which offers high quality food and service, there is also a cheaper but good dining option right next door and a Dunkin Doughnuts over the road. We stayed in a Corner Studio which was a good size offerred plenty of light and decorated pretty much like the hotel website pictures. Some aspects of the furniture were starting to show a few scratches and bumps, but overall the quality of furnishings and decoration were definately 5 star. The only thing that bugged me was the restaurant adding 20% tip for a table of two. While the service is definately of the highest order, I think it should still be up to me to add a tip which I think is justified. But overall this is a great, albeit expensive, hotel.

As we were planning for our trip... everything I read about XV Beacon made this place seem like a great place to stay. Luckily for us... when we were ready to book... the hotel was part of a Sniqueaway deal and we were able to get a great rate on a Traditional Room for 4 nights. After taking an overnight flight from the west coast... we arrived at Logan around 11 AM. We did not rent a car during our stay and headed for the shuttle bus that takes you to the T Blue-Line. The XV Beacon is a short walk (maybe 5 minutes) from the Government Center station. Upon arrival... I was figuring that we wouldn't be able to get into our room yet... since we were getting to the hotel a bit early. However... the reception was able to get us into our room early so we could clean up after our overnight journey across the country and start our vacation feeling a bit refreshed. The Traditional Room we were given was very spacious but lacked any sort of view (which did not matter to us). The room was well appointed... clean... and very modern. There is a small sitting area as well as a desk. The queen bed was quite comfortable with a large flat panel TV above the fireplace. There also was a stereo system... which was tuned to some relaxing music by the staff who did the turn-down service. Overall... we were quite impressed by the size and design of the room. The only suggestion I would put toward the hotel... since there isn't a shower curtain and just a partial piece of glass in the bathroom separating the tub from the rest of the bathroom... water easily escapes onto the bathroom floor when showering. Its only a minor detail... but we did have to clean up some water after each shower. Day 1... My wife and I visited the New England Aquarium in the afternoon (took the T Blue-Line) which was nice... but nothing like the aquariums in Chicago... Atlanta... or Monterey. It however was enjoyable for the cost. For the evening... since Game 7 of the Stanley Cup was taking place... we decided to go to The Fours to watch the game. The T Green-Line was jam packed heading to this part of the city (since it seemed the whole city of Boston was heading up to near The Garden as well). We luckily were able to get in to The Fours and somehow got a table (I still don't know how). This was 2 hours before the game... so we ordered dinner and then kept ordering drinks while the game was going on. It was quite the experience to see the fans celebrate their first Stanley Cup since 1972. We ended up walking back to our hotel... watching fans celebrate the entire way. Day 2... We accidentally slept in a few extra hours since the bed was so comfy and we were exhausted. This extra sleep probably helped though since we were heading out to do the Freedom Trail. The XV Beacon is in a great location to start the Freedom Trail... only a block or two from Boston Common. We used the Boston Frommers Book to guide us along the trail... which we thoroughly enjoyed. There was nothing to skip... eveything was so interesting. To get back to the harbor... we took the T Ferry back to near the aquarium for dinner. We went to Legal Sea Foods for dinner... which was excellent! The staff was very friendly... and took extra care of my nut allergy. The gazpacho was oh so yummy and my salmon filet cooked to perfection. We chose this as our dinner because we were heading out on a Sunset Harbor Cruise right afterwards. Seeing the city from the harbor was beautiful. We also got to see \"Old Ironsides\" lower her flag at sunset. Day 3... We did the very touristy think and take the Boston Ducks tour. It was a good way to see the sights of the city while sitting back and relaxing. It definitely was worth the price. Afterwards... we went to Cambridge to take the tour of the Harvard Campus provided by the students. It was a job well done. We got to learn about the history of the campus and learn about some of the famous graduates. For lunch... we visited Mr Bartley's Burger Cottage. Definitely not a healthy meal... but oh-so-tasty! This evening... we went to go see the primary reason we went to Boston for vacation... take in a baseball game at Fenway Park (Brewers v Red Sox). The park is amazing! It should be on everyone's \"bucket list\". Day 4... Since the Boston Bruins celebration parade was this day... our second baseball game at Fenway was pushed to the evening. So... to get out of the crowds in downtown... we took the T Red-Line to see the JFK Library and Museum. I highly recommend seeing this if you are interested in politics... history... and want to learn more about JFK. After getting back downtown... we visited the Public Gardens and took the famous Swan Boats. What a beautiful area in the middle of a metropolitan area. Then we headed out toward the ballpark with a stop at the Atlantic Fish Co for dinner on a recommendation from the concierge at the XV Beacon. One word about the food... WOW! The clam chowder was amazing and the sea bass just melted in my mouth. Probably our best meal in Boston... even though it was a little pricey it was definitely worth it! Afterwards we headed to Fenway for the ballgame. We actually walked most of the way back to our hotel since the T Green-Line was stuffed from all the fans. Day 5... Departure Day. My wife and I went to the Prudential Building for a view of the city from atop the tower. We were able to pick out many of the landmarks we had visited during our stay. Afterwards... we wandered around the Beacon Hill neighborhood. Finally... we picked up our bags from the XV Beacon and headed back to Logan after a wonder visit to Boston. The XV Beacon was a great starting point for each of our days activities. The hotel is very close to many of the T Lines. The neighborhood is extremely safe and not once did we feel at risk when walking around at night. There are always people around at all hours of the day. The staff at the XV Beacon were very professional... friendly... and helpful. They recommended dinner locations... got us checked into our room early when we arrived... helped us print out our airline boarding passes... and greeted us whenever we got back from a day on the town. The room at the XV Beacon was just what we expected. It is as beautiful as the pictures on their website. The room was comfortable and nicely appointed.

We naturally booked a direct flight and chose a smaller airport (Boston, not JFK or PHL) to minimize as much of the chaos associated with airports as possible. We flew with Lufthansa as they are quite experienced in transporting dogs and seem to take their job seriously compared to some of the carriers out there where misadventures abound. Boston has several modern, upscale hotels that not only accept dogs but cater to them and their owners. After much debate, we chose XV Beacon for its location near The Common so that our dog could romp not far from the hotel. During the planning phase, I found the Concierge there extremely helpful in answering my many questions and in arranging a limo from the airport, roomy enough for our 4 suitcases, dog crate and we three weary travelers. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted in a genuinely friendly manner and shown to our comfortable, well-appointed Corner Suite Room, selected for its roominess and lay out. When we booked our room, we actually took the Dazzle Your Dog package, as I think it was called. So, our dog, upon entering the room, was thrilled to find water, a loaner bed and some apparently very yummy homemade peanut butter dog cookies. And the best part was that her name was written on the cookie plate with edible peanut butter script! Every letter was appreciatively licked up. What a nice treat after the stress of such a long flight and ordeal! As for our comforts, the seating area was well- thought out, the beds not too firm or soft and the shower was modern and the towels lush and thirsty. The whole room design was welcoming. As we were very tired form the long flight and associated stress, we ordered room service which came in good time, was attractively presented and tasted as we expected it to. The disappointment we had was with Moo, the restaurant downstairs. We found the food over-priced for what it was and did not live up to the interesting descriptions on the menu. Then again, we had the less than stellar experience for lunch, our breakfast was okay and our dinner we experienced in our room was also acceptable. Maybe lunch should be avoided.

The amenities of the hotel make one feel pampered including a small plate of sweets on arrival, two newspapers delivered every morning (you choose which ones on check-in) which included the Sunday New York Times, turndown service that includes replacing used towels, bowls of apples and oranges on each floor and, best of all, the complimentary car service. The hotel has a sedan and a SUV, both Lexus, and one or two drivers (depending on day/time) provide complimentary car service within the city. Service that goes from the hotel can be reserved in advance. We had a plan of our activities and on arrival reserved car service for once or more each day. The driver then gives you his cell phone number, and when you are out and about you can call directly and, if the driver has time available, he will pick you up where you are and take you someplace else or back to the hotel. We tipped $5 each trip, but even more than the savings in taxi fares was the pleasure of being treated like royalty. There were just two things that marred what would have been a perfect hotel. The lighting in the room was inadequate overall (although bathroom lighting was fine) and there is no coffee service in the room or in the lobby. Coffee at the hotel's attached restaurant Moo is $4, expensive even for Boston. In fact, we ate breakfast there one morning and for two coffees, one bagel with cream cheese and one omelet (served with potatoes but no bread or toast) the bill with tax and the included 20% tip was $38.

It's obvious he knows what it takes to accommodate clientelle who enjoys and expects a certain standard of accommodations and service. Having a majority of their staff still within their employment from the hotel's initial opening speaks volumes in terms of how they are treated and respected. The staff take pride in every aspect of being a part of a classy understated establishment. It's evident. Having worked for a US Fortune 500 organization with 42,000 employees for many years and in charge of operations, I'm not easily impressed with how businesses operate but when I see one operating in the manner XV Beacon does along with the commitment of all its staff extended through their concientiousness, care and effort, I was TRULY IMPRESSED. Like some have mentioned in other reviews, yes, the lobby is dark and yes, the rooms may also be a bit on the dark side during the day but I would think most people don't check into this hotel to stay in during the daytime hours. It is a perfect setting in the evening if you wish to come back to a tranquil, handsome, and soothing space and remove yourself from the bustle of a business day or having navigated a city full of tourists. Keep up the efforts. It shows and is appreciated. I guess what doesn't hurt is what appears to be an owner with the resources and coommitment to keep everything in fresh form in the rooms and of top quality in every arena. If you like frilly fussy styled establishments, this isn't the place for you. If you like eloquence, professionalism, and efficiency executed at every level, try XV Beacon.

We never heard noise from the street (we were toward the back of the building) or our neighbors. We ate brunch at Mooo! and enjoyed it but we also loved a simple breakfast around the corner at Fill-a-Buster next to the state house, or a little further down the road at the Paramount. The hotel was very well placed -- we were able to walk to several T stations to easily access the green, red and blue lines. We were also able to walk to the Freedom Trail, North End, the waterfront and throughout Beacon Hill. The staff was very pleasant and friendly throughout our stay. However, we did not make use of the concierge or front desk staff during our stay so can't comment on that service. We found only two very mild drawbacks to this hotel. First, the shower shield on the tub that is meant to keep water from splashing onto the floor leaked, I believe from a design flaw. The cleaning staff gave us extra towels to use as an extra thick bathmat but it was an annoyance. Hopefully this will be fixed with better shield. The second drawback was the television didn't seem to be high def and the analog channels were a little fuzzy. These drawbacks were not major to us and the benefits and character of this hotel far outweighed them.

After reading the recent reviews regarding bed bug reports, our family decided to try a different hotel, XV Beacon. While the hotel's decor was certainly very nice, there were several negative things that my family and I found while staying at this hotel. Firstly, the staff is lovely and very friendly. Unfortunately, however the service is extremely slow. On one occasion we were told by room service that someone would be up in 10 minutes with our ice cream, however it took nearly 40 minutes for them to bring the ice cream. And this was after we had called down to see where our food was. Secondly, the classic room is extremely small (compared to other hotels), and can barely fit a rollaway. If you are a family larger than 2, you are going to need more than a classic room to fit your family comfortably. Thirdly, the classic room DOES NOT have a bath tub. So, if you are looking for a bath tub, the classic room is not a room for you. The reason I am writing about this is it is not explicitly stated on the website. Aside from 1 hotel that I stayed in in Europe, I have never stayed at a hotel that did not have a bathtub or bath/shower combination. On the other hand, we found the breakfast to be quite delicious. They were very accommodating and the order came out quickly. It is however, expensive. Breakfast for two people was nearly $60.00 for 2 egg dishes and a cup of coffee. While it certainly did not affect our stay at XV Beacon, I would like to make mention of the fact that the hotel's online reservation system is not updated. When my family wanted to upgrade our room, the front desk told us that no rooms were available. However, when we went online shortly after and tried to book room for the night it allowed us to chose from several different options. It even allowed you to put in all your credit card information etc. and book a room. Just to be safe, if you book a room online, I would call the hotel to verify that you have secured a room.

Overall the hotel does impress and the staff were absolutely fantastic, very helpful and obliging. My observations are: 1. It is a dark hotel, the lobby quite dark \"atmospheric\" and the rooms were also very dark with nothing of a view, and faced with an office directly opposite we had to keep the curtains closed and due to the dim lighting in the room had to go to the bathroom if I needed to do anything that needed a good light. 2. Queen size beds and not the best mattress quality, i was really surprised at this being such a classy hotel. We had a room on the third floor and had to ask to be changed as it was very noisy during the night with traffic outside our window. The staff obliged and we were put on the 7th floor which immediately was quieter and lighter (but not by much). 3. On our last morning we needed to be up and about by 5.30 to get an early flight and when my husband rang for coffee we were told by the reception that it wouldn't be available until 7 when mooo opened. I was not a happy bunny!!!! They advertise 24 room service and yet failed to deliver with coffee for the early risers. Why advertise 24 hour if it's not. Eventually I just couldn't function and rung down and told the guy that I wanted coffee and that they advertised 24 hour so why couldn't I have it??? If you're not going to provide coffee on a 24 hour basis then suggest you get coffee makers in the rooms. Finally at approximately 6.45 coffee arrived. The bathrooms are OK - we had a studio. Bath small but then this is Boston where I suppose space is at a premium. We used the hot tub on the first night as it was open, but when we tried to use it again the next two nights it was covered up and not working. Again, if you're going to advertise a facility then please leave it open during the hours you state it will be (7 am till 1 pm) we shouldn't have to wait for an hour for someone to come and sort it out. It was certainly warm enough all it needed doing was switching on but we couldn't find the switch to do it ourselves. Would have loved use of the hot tub after a long day of walking round town. I can't say enough about the staff who were so pleasant and helpful from the door men, to the drivers, concierge (who were fantastic) and the reception - perhaps with the one exception of the reception guy on nights who wasn't the happiest person there but then I suppose after a night on night shift (without coffee) I wouldn't be either. Storage wasn't that fantastic either for a studio room. One hanging space with a couple of drawers underneath (kept having to move shoes to open the drawers) and baskets on top of the hanging space which was just too bulky and impractical. I wanted drawers, a chest of drawers that all pull out to put my clothes. And the hanging rail wasn't that long as i wear maxi dresses and long skirts these were dragging over the side. Would I go back........ don't think so, I think I would try other hotels that really do provide 24 hour room service and coffee when you want it and have a hot tub that really is available to use.

The lobby is not large but it is full of welcome and the concierge staff (Jonathan, Julie and Michael) is usually there to be of assistance.

The temperature in the room was easily controlled. We were never uncomfortable. We got room service for breakfast one morning. It was delivered quickly and the meal was delicious. The fitness room was great. There are treadmills, a life cycle and free weights. It was cool in there and there were clean towels and cool water. The roof top patio has a beautiful view. You can see a lot of Boston from there. There was comfortable patio furniture up there and you can order room service items for up there. Overall the hotel is very quiet. I can truly tell you we never heard a slamming door or water running. The only noise we ever heard was a garbage truck one morning. XV Beacon exceeds every expectation possible.

My husband and I stayed here over the Fourth of July mainly to take advantage of the rooftop deck for fireworks viewing. We stayed in a Classic Room--the least expensive room type. The room was nicely appointed with showcases like a cashmere throw, a gas fireplace (which is likely delicious in the winter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot so beneficial in the summer), a doorbell, and built-in speakers. This room taught me two valuable lessons\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be perfectly happy I need a view and a bathtub: this room had neither. When I inquired at the front desk I learned that all Classic Rooms (and all of the least expensive room types at XV Beacon) face the alley behind the hotel which is approximately 20 feet from a Class B office building (complete with people working at their desks). Given the premium of space in Boston, especially in Beacon Hill this makes perfect sense, but when paying an average of $401.72 per night (including all taxes) in an attempt to escape from my own office job, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care to face directly into someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. While there is no way to upgrade the view for these rooms, the hotel could mitigate the situation by installing sheers behind the light-blocking curtains. If there were sheers, the curtains could be opened to let in light (the strategic lighting in the room created a unique atmosphere, but was way too dark for dressing, unpacking, packing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), provide privacy, and give the impression of a more desired view. XV Beacon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooftop deck delivered the fireworks with a decent view of the harbor and speakers which pumped in the Fourth of July broadcast. During the rest of our stay we were able to enjoy the hot tub on the rooftop deck when we planned ahead. The challenge was the hot tub required a call ahead of one hour to pre-heat and closed at 11:00pm, which eliminated a spontaneous end-of-the-day dip (and we missed out on our anniversary because we stayed out on the town until 10:00pm). The fitness room which has excellent equipment located indoors adjacent to the hot tub has more flexible hours. The aesthetic features are what make this hotel truly special. The transparent elevator shafts add interest and excitement and the apple and orange bowls around the hotel serve one part ambiance, one part late-night snack which is especially good because Boston is a city that shuts down early. The stairwell is constructed of gorgeous marble of a bygone era, but we got the sense that guests are supposed to travel by elevator as the stairwell is home to housekeeping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staging area and used room service items are placed on the stairs. We chose XV Beacon because we were looking for something intimate, but even with the boutique-nature of the hotel it had a busy, hurried feel. Overall, XV Beacon is a beautiful hotel in a prime location with a hardworking staff. While it likely would be ideal for business or family travel, it is just missing a certain je ne sais quoi for a romantic getaway.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cSpecial and unique boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "K_P_S24", "ReviewID": "UR115164037", "Content": "beautifully designed, friendly staff, great location and all the special touches", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cAn Outstanding Boutique Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "dfund", "ReviewID": "UR115122608", "Content": "We stayed at XV Beacon on July 4 and had a wonderful experience.

Not too shabby. It's in demand, however, so you have to plan ahead. They have a deal with Lexus; you can valet park any Lexus for free. Otherwise, it's $44 overnight. The attached restaurant, Mooo... was excellent. Like all upscale hotels, watch those breakfast prices, it adds up fast. We were very pleased with our stay at XV Beacon and hope to return soon.

The location is fantastic. They are right on the edge of Boston Common and right next to the state house. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Upon arrival we found out that the drain in our jetted tub was not working right. I put in a call to the front desk and within 3 minutes, (no lie) they were there fixed the problem and were out within 6 minutes. We stayed in a studio. It had a King bed with a stereo system throughout the room and bathroom. There was a gas fireplace and great views of the city. I read one review that complained that they could see into the building across the street. It's a city people! come on! The sheets were very soft and there was turn down service every night. They also turned on the stereo at this time to some easy listening music which was nice to come back to. The concierge Jule was a great help for setting up appointments and suggestions for restaurants. She was also a big help in getting us the hotel car for a few trips around the city. All of the drivers we had were great; friendly and professional. Housekeeping did a great job during our entire stay, even organizing my shoes for me every day. I have very few negatives to say about this hotel. While they did have an iPod dock it would have been nice to have it tied into the stereo system. Also, the fireplace is tied into the heating system so it shuts off when the room gets too warm and we had issues trying to find a balance trying to keep the room cool enough to be able to enjoy. I figured out that we need to crack the window a little to get it right, but I think there should be a better way. All in all we loved our stay.

Very well appointed, plenty of space, lovely bathroom with massive towels, great smelling toiletries, and quiet. Really quiet. In fact, that was almost the nicest thing about the place. We never heard another resident. Maybe old thick walls and ceilings? No street noise either (our room faced an office block on the 6 th floor, so maybe that was never going to be an issue). No sweeping views, but then again that's what you step outside for. Great location, easy to walk everywhere, close to the airport (just a $20 dollar ride away). There is so little traffic in Boston, and so few sirens etc., that the ovrwhelming feeling is one of calm. The restaurant downstairs ('Mooo') is excellent, though not cheap. In fact, Boston struck us as expensive all round. It's pretty upmarket. But provided you go there expecting that you won't be disappointed. Standards are generally high, and XV Beacon does not disappoint. The other big impression is of the designer's influence.

Location was excellent for business or pleasure. It was not a far walk from a lot of the sights of Boston. Charles Street was pretty close and the cemeteries and other sights (like Fanueil Hall) were not as far as you'd think. I liked this location a lot better than my previous visit which was to the Copley Square area. I was concerned that it would be far from the T, but it wasn't far at all. I took it almost every morning to the Silver Line to the Seaport World Convention Center without any issues. The hotel valet was pretty good about getting me a cab when I needed one. The hotel advertises use of a car, but every single time I asked I was told it was booked. I thought this was lame. Also, the restaurant in the hotel (\"Moo\") was overpriced and underwhelming. Not recommended. Other complaints: the hot tub on the roof is not kept hot (more like lukewarm) and so needs advance notice to be heated and there was a billing error on checkout (something double-billed) which was eventually rectified. One other niggle was that someone kept changing the radio station on the sound system in my room! Sounds minor, but we were annoyed by this! Otherwise, though, my stay was great! My room was a corner room which was decorated in a sleek modern manner. It had a jacuzzi bath tub and a heated towel bar (which I actually took advantage of to dry my socks which I washed in the sink). It had a great bed and a nice surround system. It had a lot of windows, but the view was non-descript - mostly views into neighboring office buildings. I thought that it was a pretty good value for a hotel with a luxury boutique feel. I felt fortunate to book here versus the Hyatt, Marriott, etc. or even the Ritz-Carlton which was holding a special at the time which would have made it cheaper.

Each time our stay was just perfect! The hotel is beautiful and located wonderfully close to the park and gardens. I booked everything from overseas by email and the communications were all efficient and welcoming. On our first visit we arrived after 20 hours of travel and were extremely jet-lagged. Check in was easy, staff were helpful and nice despite the large volume of luggage we had. The corner suite was lovely with a nice view, pull out couch for our son, and also a great flat screen tv where he could watch the celtics! The bed was wonderfully comfortable. Breakfast the next day was terrific as was the great dinner we had pre-booked at Moo (superb steaks and truffle fries!). The free car was such a help as my son and I purchased a lot of new computer equipment from the Apple store - all of the drivers we had were polite and friendly. The doorman was a genius at packing the truck of the taxi as we departed making sure all of our luggage fit so we did not have to take two taxis (a real feat if you saw all of the luggage we had)! On the second visit it was just myself and my husband. The staff remembered us and made us feel like we had returned home. We were upgraded to the corner suite and had a wonderful last night in the US where I enjoyed watching a movie on the bathroom tv while soaking in the bath. Our romantic room service dinner was also a treat. The car service again did not disappoint; the staff were even flexible and allowed my husband to use it to travel to his hospital appointment despite the fact it was technically outside of the radius for use of the car. I had also worked with the management to set up breakfast on the roof patio to entertain my cousins and their twin babies. When it ended up raining, the hotel didn't even blink and eye and found a quiet place for us at Moo where my cousins did not need to worry if the babies were fussy. The waiter even comped our coffees. This said the real reason I am writing this review is because of the way the staff at XV handled my family's third and final visit. We had planned for my teenaged son to fly back to Boston from a 30 day hiking trip in Alaska, meet my mom who was coming in from Atlanta , stay overnight with family before returning home to Africa where we live. Unfortunately his flight was cancelled and subsequent flights were delayed. It took him from 9pm on Tuesday to 11:30pm on Weds to get to Boston. Meanwhile my mom had been up since 3am trying to help him make the flight changes. Knowing they needed a \"soft place to land\" I called up XV and was able to quickly make all of their arrangements (rooms and the next day's airport transport) despite the early hour in Boston (about 6am). Because the hotel had all of our information on file from our previous visits they were able to bill my credit card so that my mom did not incur any additional costs. The staff were great on the phone (calm and reassuring) when we kept calling and finding that my son had not arrived as expected (yet another delayed plane). When they finally did arrive the hotel greeted them like superstars. At check in the man at the desk talked a bit with my son in swahili (what they speak where we live) They also upgraded them to the corner suite (again!), which my son loved, and had the beds ready as soon as they arrived. My son said the room service burger was the best food he'd had in a long time! The next morning my son only had four hours do do any shopping before catching his flight out of the US and the hotel made sure the car service was available for him so he could fit everything in before leaving. As a parent halfway around the world it was amazing to be able to count on the hotel to greet my son (and mom) and make his horrible day just a little better. I cannot recommend this hotel enough - thanks to the Katie Barr and the rest of the wonderful staff.

But in this case, I'm so in some ways freaked out by this place, I feel it's necessary. Here's the thing - the people who work here could not be nicer. They put a major emphasis on service and I'm really impressed. They're considerate and efficient, they don't forget anything, and that says something. Another major perk is they have a car service that will drive you to local spots (though you need to pre-arrange this). But the drawbacks, I've found, are pretty severe. I might just go in order of what struck me wrong. When I arrived, I checked in and had to ask for someone to bring up my bag. Then I got to the room. It's in a business area of Boston and out my window are people very close to me in the adjacent building, working. Way too close for comfort. Outside the other window is a building wall. They have plants outside the window which would be nice but because of the watering, the windows are filthy. I mean dirty to the degree that my Mom, who's almost 80, noticed how filthy it looked. In requesting another room, the front desk definitely made a concerted effort to accommodate me, but to be in another room, it would cost more, I'd not have two beds, but one and a pull out from a sofa, and I'd not have that room for a full stay. I decided to stick with what we have and find another hotel for the remainder of my trip. Very kindly, the front desk man, Terrance, sent a bottle of Champagne because they were sorry they couldn't work it out with me. I thought that was very nice. I'd love to leave the story at that and yet I wouldn't have been moved to write anything if not for a few other real weird and one very costly problem. The room is DARK. I mean dark like it's cavernous. My mother wondered if it was an afterthought - as though perhaps it was extra space and they should've made it a large utility closet and instead they decided to make it into a room. When you draw the curtains so you don't look at the work people, it just becomes ga-loom-y. Perhaps in the winter that would be nice but I'm not so sure. And there is very little lighting. I'm traveling with my mom and so reading is frustrating for her but even for me, and I love \"atmosphere,\" it's dim in here and hard to read. The colors are nice (all shades of browns and whites) but somehow, in a hotel room, especially this one that suffers from poor lighting, it ultimately feels depressing. There's also not a whole lot of space to unpack. We had originally planned to be here four nights. But there are a few drawers and a small closet. For two people that's not so hot. I kept stuff in the suitcase. And then there was breakfast. I actually started to laugh when I saw the bill. Here's the thing, we got a full breakfast. I'm not going to say we only got a few things. We got 1/2 a fruit plate, two juices, coffee, oatmeal, yogurt with berries, toast and bacon. They add in a 20% gratuity on top of tax of course, and somehow that is 76 dollars. I've spent that much on a budget hotel room in California, a dinner out, a haircut -- but breakfast? That blew me away. Two or three times a year my mother and I meet up in Boston to stay in a nice hotel, play Scrabble, go out for a few meals, and connect -- I live across the country and this is what we do to spend some real time together. We're kind of a kooky little travel duo. We've stayed in some very nice places with impunity (The Charles Street Inn and Hotel Commonwealth -- where we're about to head next). I've had problems with hotels, restaurants, etc. but I'm not a complainer. I'd never want to warn anyone about anything unless I really felt as though I'd be helping someone not get screwed. If you're reading this, I just don't want you to get screwed. I'm sorry to say we cannot recommend this hotel.

Without exception, the staff was very gracious and accommodating, especially the concierge Sunday evening, June 27. Lemonade or ice tea is offered at check in. This will seem small, but a nice touch is receiving an envelope with the room key and what looks like a business card attached with your name embossed on it, the hotel phone numbers, and the phrase \"In residence through (date)\". A small plate of cookies, a full bucket of ice, muted lighting, and background music are waiting in the room. Lots of upscale amenities, starting with a complementary Lexus courtesy car and driver to take you around town. Complementary shoe shine is available over night. TV, phone, towel rack warmer, bath robe, and rainforest shower head in the bathrooms. Beautiful accommodations with lots of crown molding and two tone paint jobs in the rooms. Downsides are no iron in the room (but readily available from the front desk), and no in-room coffee maker (typical of up-scale hotels). There was a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, but the layout of my room limited viewing to the bed or desk chair. Gas fireplace in the room is nice... and available for use even in June! It would be wonderful in the winter. Easy access to T at Government Center Station - straight shot from the Airport Blue Line Station ($2.00). Room service for dinner was excellent. 14 ounce sirloin steak was cooked exactly right. The chef filled a special request for a baked potato, even though not on the menu... and gave me two of them. Evening turn down service includes filling the ice bucket and leaving a card on the bed with the weather forecast for tomorrow. I wouldn't hesitate to go back on a pleasure trip... the true test of how much I like a hotel. I would, however, ask about the availability of a larger room if my wife is with me.

The Lobby is an intimate and very striking space. Check in was cordial and we received our keys (yes metal keys) to our room. Our room was on the fifth floor #506. The room was a luxury studio room on the outside corner of the building. The room looked the same as the picture above here on TA. The room looked out onto Beacon Street and down Beacon Hill with the corner of Boston Common visible and the Prudential Building looming in the distance.

The king sized bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom, while somewhat small was handsomely appointed. The rainfall shower was perfect. My wife and I enjoyed the hotel Bar at their fine restaurant Mooo while our babysitter watched our children in the room. Our bartender was great. She was friendly and professional. We were heading out to dinner and the house Lexus whisked us to our destination. Our driver was great. He recommended a place for breakfast on Charles Street.

Plumbing problems, i.e. no hot water. There was lukewarm water in the shower and the bathroom sink. Management sent someone up to fix it, but the water was still lukewarm the next night. In desperation, I crouched down under the sink and saw a water valve and turned it all the way open. That fixed the problem. I didn't know I needed basic plumbing skills to stay in a four-star hotel. I was so demoralized by two days of no hot water that I didn't even bother mentioning that the shower didn't drain. I just stood in water up over my ankles every morning. 2. Extra blanket problems. I called the front desk around 10PM to ask for two extra blankets. After a long pause, the night manager said he would check with Housekeeping to see if there were any (?) and that he would call back in 15 minutes if there was a problem. A 1/2 hour later, no call, no blankets, so I called again and finally got the blankets. How gauche of me to expect a hotel to have blankets! 3. The layout. The bathroom has a separate room for toilet and tub, with a sink and vanity area outside of it. Unfortunately, this area is opposite to the bed. There are no sliding doors to close it off, so you both better have the same sleeping schedule. 4. Everyone has their hand out for a tip. It is really obnoxious, especially in a place that doesn't really have a doorman. We were there for 5 days and 4 nights and except for our arrival and departure, where the doorman knew he was going to get a tip, we opened the heavy doors ourselves. 5. Don't bother with the free limousine service. The driver talks your ear off, hustling for a tip. A taxi is cheaper and quieter. I will not stay here again.

The front desk had confirmed our dinner reservation, but knowing that we had arrive a bit later than anticipated, took the liberty of letting the restaurant know we would be late - a nice treat to not have to do that ourselves. While we loved the idea of the car service dropping us off anywhere in town, we decided to dine at Mooo, the hotel restaurant. The service was impeccable. We were never rushed through dinner and our waiter allowed us time with our cocktails, our appetizers, and our dinner...he made sure we had everything that we needed, but never intruded on our quiet conversation. We asked to split the lobster bisque and it was served in small crocks - and tasted DIVINE! Best ever. We'll be back for it. We also split a tuna appetizer which was refreshing before switching to our filets which were worth the entire stay! Yum! We did not order dessert, but the homemade \"mallomars\" were just enough sweet treat to top off the meal. After dinner, we took advantage of the quiet roofdeck to see the city in a new light while having a nightcap. Inside a city oasis, it is lovely to have an even quieter spot to enjoy the stars. Getting back to the room, I cannot get over how clean and well appointed it was. The bathroom was modern, but also warm and inviting. The rainfall showerhead made us both re-think our own showers at home, too! What a treat. I could have stayed there forever. It was also nice to have a real hairdryer - not the typical hotel hairdryer (a small thing that makes a huge difference to a lot of women when packing!!!). The gas fireplace set a great mood, even on a summer evening, and we enjoyed just curling up and catching our breath from a busy week. We ordered room service the following morning so as to just continue enjoying our little escape. Service was prompt and the food was fantastic - allowing us a bit more time before heading back into our busy world. As we left, our farewell was as warm and charming as our arrival. And we agreed that XV Beacon would definitely be a once a year treat to ourselves. A perfect escape!! And while we did not bring our pets, the fact that it is a pet friendly hotel makes our recommendation to others even easier!!!", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helmut", "Title": "\u201cAn Absolute Pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Frau_Gunta", "ReviewID": "UR32315248", "Content": "My friend an I had the opportunity to stay at XV Beacon last week and had an amazing time.

Initially we were given a room that had a queen size bed and when they realized I am very tall and have a hard time sleeping in queen they immediately moved us to a room with a king. Frank even stayed to make sure we got situated in a new room. Once in the room, it did not disappoint. Great bed, large flat screen tv, gas fireplace with switch next to the bed. Great modern luxury decor. In addition, the bathroom was great as well, great supplies, tv next to the mirror etc. Just a great overall experience. We did not get a chance to have a meal at MOOOO their redone restaurant but we did get to go when it was The Federalist. It was so good we were disappointed that they changed it but we hear it is great. We did however go out to a restaurant and the hotel provided us with a Chaffeur driven Lexus LS460 which was such a nice touch, In addition, Matt who drove us over gave us a full review of the restaurant and told us what was good on the menu. For the record his suggestions did not disappoint. My only compaint is that i had to leave the next day and head to the chain hotel.

We were told that no upgrades were available that night but would be available the next night. No effort was made in day two to upgrade our room. Additionally, part of the program was to give us an $85 credit for dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. When we went to the restaurant for dinner and told them we were hotel guests, we were told that there were no tables available for us for the entire evening but we could sit at the bar and eat. Breakfast was included as part of the program and available. My wife and I had to share a rather smallish queen bed. In the room, which faced the side of an adjacent building, was only one rack to place our luggage.

Yes, the staff, except for one incident, was very pleasant and attentive, but my expectations were not met. The hotel is beautiful and in a great neighborhood, but here are my issues: I was told that, with the exception of two rooms, there are no king sized beds at this hotel. When I requested a king bed, I was told king beds are not available in my rate category. Excuse me, but for $400+/night, I can get a king bed at plenty of four star hotels without being told \"it's not available in my price category.\" I'm 6'2\" and my wife isn't short, so we prefer a king bed. To deal with the situation, we ordered a rollaway bed so that we wouldn't end up kicking each other at night. I couldn't believe the rollaway. In my opinion, it was ridiculously uncomfortable, so we it taken away. In addition, the hotel wanted to charge us $35/night for the rollaway. I thought that was pretty hilarious given that we couldn't be accommodated with a king bed. Lest I forget, when one of the staff members entered the room to stock the minibar, or bring in the rollaway, they didn't pull the door entirely shut when they exited. Hence our room was left open for anyone to enter. To add to my disappointment, the room was dirty (see photos). There was a substantial amount of dust on the television shelf and in the bathroom, not to mention a grimy build-up of gross material toward the bottom of the shower door seal. The HVAC vent is located above the sleeping area so that air was constantly blowing on us as we tried to sleep. We ordered a blanket, but none were available. A couple of sheets were given to us instead. Evidently the HVAC is not a climate-controlled system that shuts off once the room reaches a specific temperature. Perhaps the system in our room wasn't working properly, but I finally turned it off so that we didn't have a constant draft blowing on us. This, however, created a whole other issue. Food odors from the restaurant started to come through the vent. The four-poster bed is positioned in such a way that one's view of the television is impeded, it's absolutely absurd. We had to call to ask for tissue and toilet paper as it wasn't replenished, nor did anyone think to store any of these extra necessities under the rather ample sized bathroom vanity. There was no hot water in the shower one morning, evidently there were plumbing problems that day. I realize that unexpected issues arise, but this certainly didn't make me any happier, nor did the excessively loud music that permeated from the adjoining room. To sum things up: great location, beautiful boutique hotel, but housekeeping could do a better job. In my opinion, you should add king sized mattresses -- there's certainly enough room to do so. Eliminate the four-poster bed or install a plasma above the fireplace so that one can see the entire television screen. Given the four and five star hotels that are under construction in Boston, I think XV Beacon needs to focus on making some changes if they are going to effectively compete in the marketplace.

When we checked in I was disheartened to see that we had been given a room on the 2nd floor. When I asked the woman working the desk if there was anything available on a higher floor, she told me that there was not but not to worry it wasn't on the street side and therefore wasn't noisy. Is it possible that she is unaware of the garbage truck that arrives at 6 every morning and spends 30 minutes loading all the garbage from the hotel restaurant?? Trust me, we would have welcomed a bit of traffic noise by comparison!

I had intentionally not booked the least expensive rate for just this kind of reason. The man at the desk gave me $200 off our stay which at least was something though it could be considered an admission of guilt. But what really upsets me is that I left a shirt in the room. There is no doubt in my mind because I had it when I was unpacking and didn't have it when I got home the day we left. The room was extremely dark so it doesn't surprise me that I might have overlooked something. I called to inquire and they said that it had not been found. I then wrote the assistant manager an email imploring him to look again and I received no response at all! Then I forwarded that email to the manager of the hotel letting him know that the assistant hadn't responded and I have had no response from him either.

One of the reasons I was so attracted to this hotel was that every room had a 4-poster bed but having stayed there now - I really didn't see the point in having very plain metal bed posts round the bed in the Standard Room we stayed in. It looked like we were sleeping inside a fish tank or some kind cage! I think the larger rooms have more decorative bed posts but they should take the posts out of the standard rooms because they look boring and out of place and get in the way of the TV! I sent the following e.mail to the hotel and have had no response: .............. My husband and I stayed with you last weekend and enjoyed it very much but I would like to note a few things for your consideration: 1) We had to call several times for things to be brought to our room. I asked twice for a second robe but never got it and we waited more than half an hour for an ironing board and iron after requesting it twice. Your In-room dining service managed to prepare and deliver a full cooked breakfast in less time than it took for someone to deliver an iron! 2) The fire was always on (although very low - with one small flame - it still created a fair bit of heat) even when it was switched \"off\" so that we had to have the air conditioning on all the time just to keep the room at a reasonable temperature. I imagine that this wastes a considerable amount of energy and as someone who cares for the environment I found this very unsatisfactory. 3) There was a chair in our room that space didn't really allow for. We had to move it to get into the mini bar and it just didn't fit anywhere else. My advice would be to remove this kind of chair from this kind of room. 4) It was an unpleasant surprise to find the housekeeping area with a mess off dirty laundry and cleaning products at the bottom of the stairs coming down from floor 10 to 9. It looked really bad compared to the high standards elsewhere in the hotel. I assume it is unintended for guests to use the stairs here but this was not clear to me. 5) When we checked out the person at the front desk didn't ask us if we had enjoyed our stay and although he was polite I would normally expect such a question to be asked. When they don't ask it feels like they don't care about their guest's experience at their hotel. We still had a good time but overall - for the price - I feel that the XV Beacon isn't worth it.

The reception desk (in particular Josh) were friendly and understanding throughout this process. Our room was very luxurious and comfortable - as you would expect from this type of hotel. Room service was fairly quick (about 30mins) and tasty - although the room really wasn't big enough for the enormous wheely trolley it came served on. We also ate in the restaurant, the Fed, which was also good quality food - the winelist is impressive and extensive. One draw-back if you like to relax somewhere other than your room, is the lack of \"public space\" at the hotel - there is only a small area in the lobby. There is a roof garden, but it was closed during our stay.

I am reluctant to \"share\" this rare find with others but it is truly one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in. We usually stay at 4-5 star hotels and found this hotel to compare with the likes of the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons, but with more character and a truly amazing staff. First, it is a smaller hotel with a TON of character. From the minute you walk into the lobby to the moment they bring your car to go home, you feel as though you have your own staff to help you. Michael, at the front desk, is fantastic and even upgraded our room upon arrival. The room was fabulous, with 5 huge windows, a fireplace, sitting area (with a very comfy couch for 2), a walk in closet, and a four-poster queen bed with fine linens. The bathroom featured a 4-inch TV, a towel warmer, a jacuzzi tub with a \"rainfall\" shower head, AND \"Fresh\" shampoo's and lotions (which is a skin care line I LOVE from Sephora). The room itself was very cozy, comfortable and romantic - great for a short stay without the kids. We ordered room service from the restaurant downstairs for dinner and lunch, and have to say it was one of the best in-room dining experiences we have ever had. The portions were very large and not too expensive for the great tasting food. Try the Chicken breast entree, the Fed burger, and the salads. My husband had the lobster bisque soup and said it was the best he had ever had. I wish that we had tried their breakfasts but we'll save that for our next visit. Also, they have a new Lexus sedan that you can use as your complimentary transportation while you are there. We did not use it, but if we had wanted to go to dinner downtown the driver would have dropped us off and then we would have paged him to pick us up!! Very nice touch~ We were at the Beacon because we had an appointment at Lahey Clinic today. We stayed over last night and then checked out today. Our appointment ran until 12:30 at the clinic,so we asked if we could have a late check-out so we could come back and have a rest and some food before we hit the road for home. They, of course, said \"yes\". We ended up checking out at 3 pm and they were MORE than accomodating with our requests. We WILL MOST DEFINITELY stay here again. This is our new Boston hotel.

The hotel is very well located in downtown Boston and has an excellent reputation. Unfortunately we did not have as nice of an experience as we had expected. Our room (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Classic Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) was decorated nicely but was lacking in some major areas. The first thing that we noticed was the size of the bed. If it is any bigger than a double bed, I would be shocked (you will notice that the website never describes what size the beds are). The worst part of the room had to be the bathroom. We were put into what turned out to be a handicapped room with a handicapped bathroom (i.e. no tub, only a shower that basically consisted of a shower head and curtain on one side of the bathroom). When taking a shower, you had to strategically place towels around the shower to keep water from flooding the bathroom and spilling out into the hallway because there was no divider between the shower floor and the bathroom floor. Flooding was obviously a problem in the past because the wood on the bathroom doorframe looked like it had been rotting for some time. The worst part was that the white shower curtain was pink with mildew and with nothing holding it back you constantly had to fight it off as you were trying to get clean. The grout in between the shower tiles was also pink with mold and there was no place to put your soap or shampoo except on the disgustingly moldy floor. Additionally, a few of the things the hotel touts as unique are in-room fireplaces and TVs in the bathroom. Well, neither of these worked in our room. We called the front desk about the fireplace and they sent someone up to try and solve the problem. After discovering that the pilot light was unlit, the fireplace was turned on. After about 15 minutes the entire room smelled of gas and the fire, which was obviously out of control, started melting the exterior paint on the fireplace. We complained twice at the front desk and both times received a short \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before they turned back to their work. In my opinion, the ultimate disservice was never receiving a response back to a letter that I wrote to the General Manager complaining about our stay.

We had heard that XV Beacon was an excpetional place to stay, and thought we'd give it a try. We've traveled extensively, and have had the very appreciated opportunity of staying in wonderful resorts and hotels in the world. Our room was quite lovely in that it encompassed expansive windows across two walls and beautiful sunlight, and has a very intimate feel to it. However, a five star hotel should not, for instance, have a writing pad stuck underneath a wobbly desk leg, a lamp and blinds that do not work, and have forgotten to put shampoo in our room. It should not take three phone calls to have ice delivered, especially in a hotel that puts a clear emphasis on service. And, although many reviewers have had terrific experiences there, which I am sure are all accurate, a five star hotel should never have this kind of lapse in service. We were also disappointed in the concierge service -- nice person, but overly expedient in getting us out the door when asked for directions, etc., and fogot to call us back when he was trying to find a dinner reservation for us. Although, I should always remember to ask, we were also not told about the additional valet parking fee, and would have parked our car in the convienent lot next door; because my favorite little light from The Boulder's in Arizona, that was attached to my key chain was completely crushed when we got our car. Some valet service. There were numerous other problems with service, which is most unfortunate for a hotel of this kind. Perhaps this is primarily a place for business travel (it's very quiet and private), with much less care and attention paid to the weekend getaway person.", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot the Best...

On the plus side the room service was very quick and reasonable quality. The prices for mini-bar, which stocks top rate wines and champagne like Opus One/Krug, and room service were very reasonable. The Mercedes drop off service is very convenient. The rooms are spacious and comfortable but could use some touching up. The beds could be better but were acceptable.

The time it was expected to go back on became later and later, so we moved into the Four Seasons for a night. The next day we returned to XV Beacon (the Four Seasons was sold out). The AC was working in the rooms, but I had requested a quiet room, and was somewhat anxious about the second floor front room I had received. The clerk assured me that Beacon Street was quiet at night. It was technically not night at 4:30 AM when the garbage trucks arrived. I asked to be moved to a quiet room in the back, and was warned the garbage trucks in the back came at 6:30 AM. Which they did, but I get up early. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is elegant and amusing, but the rooms are underlit. It is hard to find anything in the drawers or even to read in bed. But services were good. Room service was prompt, the Mercedes house car was very convenient, and laundry was done quickly.

Josh, who answers comments in this forum, made sure that our room was exactly as it was supposed to be with a pull out couch and a crib. I emailed him prior to our stay and he got back to me within a day. We were in one of the suites, which had plenty of room for me, my wife, and 3 kids. Rooms need a little bit of work, as TVs are CRT, the furnishings are a little plain, and walls need some touch ups, but they say that those renovations are coming soon. The beds are very comfortable, though. I would personally like to see iHome iPod compatible alarm clocks, but that's just me. Room temperature was perfect even on an 80 degree day.

This was a work trip that came up and I had very little time to price compare and little time to plan. The room was clean, renovated and fairly spacious. Location was awesome. By the time we arrived, handed my keys to valet (typical $55 valet parking charge for downtown CHI), and checked in I was exhausted...yet we were in Chicago so we had to search out good food, right? On our way to our rooms we stopped by the concierge desk to ask about good dinner options that were within easy walking distance. Note...even if it is an unseasonable winter in the Midwest, cold windy city weather off of Lake Michigan is still cold. Most of my tried and true dinner options required a bit of a walk or transpo (aka Frontera and Greek Islands come to mind, there are others...but those are two of my faves). There was no one at the concierge desk when we arrived. We waited 10 minutes before a staff person walked by and asked if we needed any assistance...duh. He was sweet but informed us that there was no concierge on duty (really...no sign? really? it was only ~ 6pm on a weekday?) he was also new to the city so he referred us to the front desk. I walked back to the front desk, obtained a restaurant list, then proceeded to drop my luggage off in my decently appointed room. Ethnic is awesome and Spanish Tapas is something that we can't get at home in Madison, WI. We walked 5-6 blocks in biting, windy-city cold only to learn from a neighboring hotel bellhop that the place had \"been closed for several months\". At this point, we walked so faraway from the Mag mile, our hotel and our \"known\" faves that we just started looking for something that was easy with good flavor. We ended up walking up Division an hit Lou Malnatti's. Another good fave with Italian flavor...so we hit it. We walked back to the hotel. I logged in to email. I really wanted Midwestern free WIFI. It didn't happen so I went to bed, slept well, got up, woke up, checked out, crossed the street to the Corner Bakery for breakfast and free WIFI and worked for a few hours. Overall, this is a great room and great location for a great value ($99 +$55 for parking). I would pick this up for a leisure trip without any question...I would have time to research dinner and entertainment options. For a work business trip with limited time I would have paid a bit more for more service .", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vicenza", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel in a nice city\u201d", "Author": "alessandro f", "ReviewID": "UR125244502", "Content": "my wife and i went there for a night and we were surprised about the size of the room that we stayed in.it was really big and clean.Also the rest of the hotel was clean and the staff was nice. the only thing that for me wasn't right was the price of the parking: 54$ against 98$ of the room. so my advice is to park the car close to the hotel where you can save 30$ and have a drink somewhere.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "camillenesler", "ReviewID": "UR125087378", "Content": "Really close to everything on Michigan Ave, loved walking around and seeing all the Christmas lights!

The room was very big, it was nice to have a separate room that closes off from the living room with the fold out bed so our tv didn't keep the kids awake. We were hoping for a great view, however, the only thing we had a good view of was offices across the street, close enough that we felt we had to keep the curtains pulled even during the daytime. The location was excellent, right off of Michigan Avenue. The breakfast buffet was expensive, so we decided room service was a better value. Still expensive, but the kids enjoyed it. However, because it was still so expensive, probably would go to Corner Bakery next time, we just were unsure if our picky eaters would find something they liked there. Another reviewer wrote that the pool was the size of a postage stamp, I would definitely have to agree. I had promised the kids we would go swimming at night, got there at 9pm, and the pool was so full of kids in such a tiny space that we just had to say no and go up to the room and rent a movie instead. To me, there is no point of having a pool if it is going to be this small and in such a small, dark area. However, a lot of families probably won't go to a hotel without a pool, so I'm thinking this is why they put in this tiny pool. Overall, with the Groupon, this was an excellent deal and we would stay again, and just not plan on going swimming.

The situation with the reception on the second floor is a tad odd and when we arrived there was a crazy-busy conference reception happening and the noise was insane. We took the elevator up to the sixth floor and the state of the carpets was abysmal and had me seriously worried about the rooms. There were enormous dark stains on the carpet. That said, the rooms actually turned out to be just fine. They were clean and relatively well-kept, although I'd say the double beds ran small and were not terribly comfortable. And I have to give credit to the housekeeping staff - by a couple of hours into our stay they had removed almost all the stains from the carpeting. (By the next day, a couple of fresh ones appeared which made me fear the stains said far more about the behavior of guests than the level of staff attention.) Pool is small, but serviceable. The hot tub wasn't particularly hot. Sauna and steam room are nice touches, although the former had stopped working by the second night of our trip. The staff were very polite the entire time.

Was a little hesitant at first but based on what the other hotels cost during this time of month, the deal we got was a no brainer on top of the fact that it sits right in the middle of everything. Literally was 1 block from all the shopping of North Michigan avenue and close to many accessible bus stops. Pros: Room. We arrived early around 830am and was hoping to check in early than the 4pm check in time on our reservation. No problem there. Jordan the front desk person hooked it up and we were in our room in a matter of minutes. The room was huge, like a suite. First half was a living room type area with a couch and TV. We hardly spent any time in it and down the hall way was the bathroom and the large bedroom with another TV and nice view with a descent view of the city. We were on the 4th floor right next to the gym and swimming pool. Staff: Both the front desk and concierge's were awesome. Russell, Kaitlen, and another young gentlemen (forgot your buddy sorry) were always very welcoming in the mornings and evenings when we would pass by their desk and ask how our day went and what he had planned. If we wern't so tired from walking everywhere and getting up so early both days, we would have took them up on some of the nightlife entertainment hookups they had to some of the nice lounges/clubs. Cons: Not many but if I had to mention one thing it would be the lack of a true refridgerator. There is a fridge looking thing in the room but is only used to temporarily keep things cool. It would have cost us an additional $15 a day to have one delivered from housekeeping. Would have been nice to store some of our yummy leftovers to snack on but ended up throwing it all away. Also the TV's were pretty outdated but then again, by the time we got back from a long day outside, our eyes were too tired to pay attention to the quality of the monitor. Personal suggestions: 1) Purchase an unlimited CTA pass (for metro and bus) from the airport. We took the orange line from Midway Airport all the way to the Rosevelt stop and just hopped on the bus which took us a block away from our hotel in front of the coach store (ontario and michigan). Was very conveneint and affordable. A 3 day unlimited pass will cost you $14. We used my wife's Google App on her phone to figure out the most optimal transit routes to take (bus/metro/walking) to get from point A to B. Very helpful. 2) Take the architectural boat toar suggested by the concierges. It was about $38 per person and was a great way to city all the different buildings. Unfortunately it rained during our tour but it was still a great time. The tour also provides snacks like muffins and cookies along with hot coco and starbucks coffee to keep your stomachs happy. 3) Try some of Chicago's famous eateries for lunch, which are chicago style hot dog, deep dish, and italian beef sandwich. The first day we hit Mr. Beef, was awesome. Highly recommend it. The next day we hit Giordono's and watch some NFL football. Wasn't bad. The last day we hit this hot dog spot next to Pippin's (thanks for the suggestion Russell). Was very tasty. 4) If you want to get away from downtown for dinner and experience some good authentic Italian, I would highly recommend checking out Lincoln Park/Lake View area. It's probably about 2-3 miles north of the hotel. We went to Riccardo Trattoria and must say it was probably the best Italian we've had since we visited Rome. They have a 3 course menu for $33/person and the portions are very filling and full of great flavors. You won't be dissapointed. Be sure to make reservations. 5) If your a baseball fan, take the metro (L) to wrigley field. The cubs were out of town when we were there but they were offering a tour of the stadium/locker rooms for $25 a person for an hour tour. Would have done it but the wifey wasn't big on the idea so we hit a bar next door to watch the Steelers/Bears game. Fun experience. We'll definitely be back again. Probalby with the kids next time. There are so many awesome museums and other things for the kids to do there that we did not get to explore. Beautiful city and the beach there was very pretty and clean. Great place for a morning/afternoon run. Was within walking distance from the shopping on N.

The previous two visits were very pleasant. The staff was always great & seemed to go out of their way for us, the rooms seemed a bit tired when we were here 2 years ago, but not too bad. Plus, the great service made up for it. However, this time I called a month prior to our trip & asked if they by chance they were renovating & if so, if there was any way we could stay in a renovated room. The person at the desk transferred me to a manager, & I left message for a manager (unfortunately I cannot remember her name) asking the same questions. No one ever bothered to return my call. That should have been my first warning. When we got to hotel, the staff was pleasant, but our room was very tired. The carpet was filthy & the light fixture in the entrance was so outdated & dirty. It was a dingy cream fabric light that fanned into half a circle. It looked like it was falling apart & was stained. The last night of our stay, we were upgraded to a suite by Kartika (manager), for some of our troubles, so the extra space was definitely nice. Kartika was the friendliest person we dealt with by far, she was great! The sofa in the suite was so stained, we were afraid to sit on it. Since we took this trip to treat our youngest daughter to American Girl Place, we purchased the AG doll hair styling package with our reservation. This package included a doll bed, hair products for the AG doll, & it was supposed to include a DVD with hair styling tips for the doll. Also, the package included an AG channel. What the package failed to tell us was that no one would have any idea what hair styling DVD we were referring to. Also, the \"channel\" was just the Kit Kittredge movie playing over & over. The package, at the time (2 weeks ago), did not say that the movie looped again & again, but it does now. It did not at the time, we checked while there & shared with the staff. At the time the website even said the DVD was one to take home. It no longer does say it's to take home, but I bet the staff still doesn't know what DVD the website is referring to. Glad the website at least now says the movie is looped & the DVD doesn't say it's to take home for the sake of those staying there from here out. Not major things to some, but still irritating & disappointing. Also, the first two times we stayed at WC, the staff had the AG bed & everything set up so nicely in our room for our daughter. Such a sweet treat for our daughters. This time, they did not. In fact, when we got up to our room, we had to call down to the desk to ask where our AG bed was. They brought it up, but I was disappointed that the extra details we once loved, no longer existed at WC. One day, our beds were never even completely made. We got back to our room late & didn't even bother calling down to let the desk know about our unmade beds because we were tired. We were greatly disappointed that this hotel we once loved just didn't seem to care about the little details that matter greatly or about the major details that make one sleep better at night (dingy carpets, etc). When we got home we found out that WC overcharged us. My husband called & spoke to Kartika (since she was great with us) & she took care of it, but this was just another let down from WC. No one from the staff was ever rude & the rooms were cleaned the best they could be given the situation, but like I said, the staff (besides Kartika) just didn't seem to go the extra mile & the rooms need a major renovation or at least new furniture, carpet & fresh paint.

The living room area has some outdated (and ripped) furniture that looks like it was just thrown in to eat up some of the space. (I posted pictures). It's a large open space that I really dont want to spend any time in and doesn't feel relaxing. The bathroom is larger with HUGE counter space which is nice but that's the only plus there. In a suite I would expect a nice closet and probably one that is even larger than a standard guest room. Well, the closet here is TINY - less than 2 feet across (picture posted). There a 2 TVs in the room but both old tube TVs. The carpet throughout the hotel is well worn. The only reason I didn't rate this lower is becuase all of the staff I have met from front desk to housekeeping, concierge, banquet staff, and front desk have been professional, helpful and friendly.

The other concierge who was helping me was very helpful nevertheless and he gave me some helpful insights about the city, which I appreciated as it was my first time visiting Chicago. However one day I tried to reach him over the phone a couple of times but he was never available. That same woman working with him was the one who always answered the phone.

A couple other minor issues I had is that one of the bell man hit on me as I was getting out of the elevator and one gentleman working in the pool area made sure he took a quick peek at me as I was getting out of the water. Otherwise everything was fine. The pool was the perfect size as I am 5'3 and I don't swim. The steam room, sauna and whirlpool were enjoyable.

The lobby is dirty-- the carpets are a mess. Once in the room we called down to the concierge to ask about a service in the hotel-- no answer. Called the front desk-- no answer. Our room was clean and that was a relief. But the amenities in the room are so antiquated. A cd alarm clock? A hair dryer my mom had when I was 14 stuck to the wall. An old Panasonic tv. No internet cables to plug into? I was surprised. Given the expense and location -- I expected something more updated. Then we moved to the pool-- TINY. Very small. And at 10:30pm it was filled with children. With no life guard on duty they dove, splashed, and generally annoyed everyone else there.

Service was a different story. Upon arrival at valet, there was a huge line. Probably 10 cars waiting to be parked, doubled stacked along the street. No one approached us to ask if we were checking in. We unloaded our own car entirely, along with our daughter in my arms and stood there looking for someone to help us. Finally we saw a valet who came and gave us a luggage claim ticket and ushered us off. Upon walking in the doors, it was very unclear where to go, but you must get on the elevator and go up a level to check in. The check in attendant was less than friendly. No smiles, no \"enjoy your stay,\" nothing warm or welcoming. We went to our room and waited for our luggage. We waited and waited and waited. Finally we called the front desk - which transferred us to valet - valet claimed they had no luggage waiting to be delivered. They asked for our claim ticket number - which we gave to them. They found our luggage and brought it right up to us. Freddy - from valet who delivered our luggage - was really the only friendly and helpful employee at the hotel. Total time waiting for our luggage was around an hour and a half. We consulted concierge a few times. Once for a dinner recommendation, somewhere we could take our 13 month old, and were given unuseful suggestions. Small, overcrowded restaurants, certainly not baby friendly. The second time was to ask where we could purchase a cup of milk for our daughter at bedtime. The concierge attendant answered \"the bar\" and then walked away. I felt as though I was keeping her from something more important. As for the amenities...the room was clean, the bathroom was quite large and the beds were comfortable. The walls were thin and I often worried that our crying baby might disturb other guests. We plan to visit Chicago again soon, but we will be staying in a different hotel.

Negatives: 1. The shower in the bathroom must be about 5 foot from the base of the bath meaning that the average person would have to crouch to have a decent shower (also the water pressure was poor). 2. The pillows. I presently have a very sore neck/upper back. You are provided with plenty of pillows on the bed. However they are either exteremly soft (even piling 3 on top of each other the head touches the mattress) or large and very hard. I requested for something inbetween however, apparently only these two types are available...poor show. 3. Timing of room being cleaned. Each day i would leave at 9/10 am and returning at 4 (ready to crash after a hectic day) my room was never made up. On the plus, it allowed me to retreat to the bar for a drink! The maids were exteremly nice. However, water was never replenished. 4. MiniBar. Why offer a fridge and nothing in it? If I want a Coke, should I really have to call room service (including SC and delivery fee)? Often room service did not answer (despite calling separately over 30 minutes). Eventually I needed to call the front desk with my order. 5. Room service - food only available until 10pm. Also, there was no dining menu in my room. When I had this sent up, it was very very limited. Additionally, I had a rather strange guy (with pony tail) that came with my order. Not sure if he is suited to room service as I felt rather uncomfortable (mentioning service charges and looking strangely at me when I know full well it is included with the bill), so much so that I didnt order again. 6. Noise - not much the hotel can do about being next to the Emergncy Department however, the sirens are very loud. 7. Information in the room. Very limited details of pool etc. 8. Access. The hotel really should have its reception on the Ground floor of hotel with direct access to all floors. Using 2 lifts is a hassle. 9. Staff. Really quite impersonable. In 5 days I had not one welcome from the door staff despite me attempting to smile and make eye contact. Also, an extremelly disappointing member at reception when I needed a new room key (as the one I had didnt work).

There was nothing but problems and the staff was far from helpful. When I arrived and checked in, the man at the desk said that he was having problems programming the keys. He then sent us up to the tenth floor for our room. We entered into the living room portion of the suite and that is when things started going downhill. The TV was on in the bedroom and as we started walking further into the room, we noticed used towels laying on the floor. My boyfriend tiptoed into the bedroom and when he saw a lump on the bed, we realized that WE HAD BEEN SENT INTO A ROOM THAT WAS ALREADY IN USE! We lugged our heavy luggage back down and informed the man working the desk about what had just happened. He did not seem too concerned. He gave us two breakfast coupons, which I guess was supposed to make us feel better about the bizarre experience that had just occurred. We already had all of our meals planned out and reservations made at the restaurants, so we were not going to be able to use the coupons anyway. Then he goes, 'We'll put you on the ninth floor. It is a corner room, so it is nice.' At this point I am irritated, but I just want to get into a room. We bring our luggage up to the ninth floor and find our room. We walk into a room that is definitely not a one-bedroom suite. I call down and get a woman working the front desk. I ask why I was downgraded to a different room than the one I had reserved. She goes, 'Well, there are no one-bedroom suites left. He already gave you breakfast coupons.' I explained that the breakfast coupons were for the fact that we had walked in on someone's room, now we had a different problem. Not only did he downgrade us, but he didn't even tell us. That is just deceitful. She suggested that we switch rooms the next day. She was rude and sounded completely unconcerned. The next day we had to repack all of our stuff and lug it back down to the lobby. There were different staff working and I explained the situation. They said that we could check our luggage in downstairs and our room would be ready in the afternoon. I asked if they had ever figured out what happened the night before and they just laughed and avoided the question . They then said that they would talk to their manager about it, but I was never contacted by any manager. I am assuming that they never told anyone. We checked our luggage in and went about our day. When we came back, the room was ready. For the third time, we hauled our luggage back up, this time to the fourth floor. It was the right room and no one was in there so that was a small victory. We sat down to relax a bit and watch tv and it wasn't working. We called down to the front desk and you could tell they were irritated. We explained that the tv wasn't working right. A repair man had to come up and change out all of the wires behind the tv and then reprogram it. It was just one more thing to add to the list of problems. The room was rather dirty and I will be adding photos to the review. I had planned this whole weekend for my boyfriend's birthday and all of the problems really put a cloud over our plans. I would have felt so much better if the staff had acted like they cared. Instead they made me feel as though I was being a brat for complaining at all. We used to live in Chicago, so we come back quite frequently to enjoy the city. I can guarantee that we will not be staying at the Wyndham for any future visits.

After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit nervous about staying here, but I got a pretty good price from Priceline and I was looking forward to my first experience in a four star hotel, so I decided to give it a try. When I called to confirm my room, the gentlemen who answered the phone was rude and hung up on me before I had a chance to ask him for my confirmation number. Not a good start. The actual check-in went very smooth. I arrived early, the young lady at the desk was very nice and I was able to get an early check in without a problem. I stayed on the 17th floor. The king room is small and not very clean. Even though the beds were very comfortable, there was a HUGE COBWEB right above my bed. Also, I can't believe how old the TVs are. I didn't go to Chicago to watch TV, but it would have been nice to have something decent to watch and one would think since they don't provide free WiFi, they would at least invest in modern TVs, and more channels. After my first night there, I left my room at about 10:15am, after more than four hours of walking and shopping, I wanted to come back to the room charge my cell phone and relax a bit before going back out for dinner and a show. I arrived back to the room at about 2:45pm and the room had not been cleaned. Housekeeping walked in within 10m of my arrival to begin cleaning, so of course I was not comfortable staying there watching them clean, so I went back out. Also, the faucet on the bathroom sink was loose to the point that I thought it may actually come completely off. On the plus side, the restaurant downstairs makes a GREAT steakburger and the bartender, (I've forgotten his name) makes a great cosmo and was very helpful with information about nearby jazz clubs and even gave me a free pass to Backstage.

I did not eat in the hotel as there are several inexpensive eating options across the street and within a 5 minute walk.

The restaurant seemed to have lots of staff, and claimed to be upmarket, yet had a very limited and constant menu, and the one time we tried it two burgers took ages and though the fries were hot the burgers were nearly cold. The bar had no draft beer and was in near total darkness - this may have made the TV easier to watch, but seemed a bit low-rent in a good hotel.

We are Aussies and arrived early(11am) having travelled approx 18 hrs. Firstly: Check in is not on the ground floor, you need to take the lift up a floor. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman & explained why we were here early. He actually asked if we wanted a high or lower floor.! I was \"armed' with all the reviews \"dont's\" so I was prepared to argue/fight to get a room on a higher floor, so no noise & we could sleep. He offered us a room on the 17th floor with a king bed, so we took it. I didn't have to say a word - he must have sensed I was well prepared & very jetlagged, so don't argue with a tired Aussie! Unfortunately, our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm, but he suggested we come back at 2.30pm & they'd see what they could do. The gentleman recognised us straight away & advised our room was ready. The room was clean, tidy with a limited view & the bed was very comfortable. The best part was - we DIDN'T HEAR any sirens from the ambulances at the hospital.! The hotel doesn't have a pick-up service & no free Internet. Secondly: The location was great - easy walk to Michigan Ave, the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier etc, we walked everywhere & there is a tourist information just up the road near the Water Tower. Shopping is on your doorstep & there are some great restaurants, so venture out as we didn't eat in the hotel. It wasn't windy at all for early Sept, & we went Chicago Beach for lunch, where there is a great cafe/restaurant right on the beach. If you get a sunny day its excellent down there- a good feed & some cold beers (made us feel at home- except no waves at the \"beach\").

Basically, don't let that detour you from staying here. And, if you're not happy with something, don't hesitate to ask.

It was GREAT. We got a deal through travelzoo for $129 per night upgrade to a jr suite and free breakfast buffet for each morning. This was an amazing deal! We got the top floor corner suite and it was great ! The view was nice and the bed comfy. Can't say enough about the staff. They were great from the restaurant to the conceirge to the front desk. We came in early and our room was not ready so we left our luggage which was no problem. This was our first trip to Chicago and i would recommend taking a map everywhere you go and asking for directions as its a bit confusing becaue the streets are named and not numbered like nyc. The concierge recommended a fabulous restaurant Piccolo Signo for our first night and it was GREAT. moderately priced and you MUST sit outside to get the full affect. primarily italian food. it was really great. The breakfast buffet was very good. all you can eat scrambled eggs, fruit, potatoes, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, bacon, etc. we had no problems and no complaints at this hotel. I would definately stay again. it is super close to michigan ave and close to other sites. You can hear the noise from the hospital outside but it did not bother us to much. One thing we did for our stay i would not recommend was the Adler Planetarium. Personally, it was not worth the $40 admission for the two of us. The exhibit was soso and we saw the 3D show and i would not reccomend it. Especially for kids. I was bored and I'm not 5 !! Overall though, I recommend Chicago and this hotel highly.

The bathroom was large with nice amenities. My husband used the workout and pool facilities that were on 4th floor. There was a wide range of equipment. The pool & whirlpool area was small but very clean. For a quick breakfast we went to the Corner Bakery which was kiddie corner from the hotel or else you could go in the opposite direction to Dunkin Donuts. We did eat in the bar area of the hotel one day for lunch. They ran a $10 special that also included a drink. The food was very good and the service was excellent. We had a window table so we could watch all the people walking by. Friday night we ate a Gino's Pizzeria which is only 2 blocks north (corner of Superior & St. Clair).

I was offered an upgrade to a Corner Suite for $30 extra a nite. I wanted to see the difference, so at first I declined. The standard room I was given was nice, and clean and well appointed. Had it been just me traveling, it might have been ok. The view was not spectacular in this room as I guess many on that side of the hotel are since they directly face a 16 story wall next door. Like I said, for the business traveler or someone who doesn't mind that view, it would have been just fine. I wanted to have a lil more room and a great view for my first time guest, so I opted for the suite. I can honestly say this was the best $30 I spent all weekend. (per nite). It made ALL the DIFFERENCE. The room was larger by about 100 sq feet or more and the view from 4 huge windows was great. Just what we needed. The hotel itself was very quiet all weekend and the staff and housekeeping never bothered us at all. The bathrooms were all marble and very updated and also had a full size tub too. I am reaching to find ANY vice, but the only one that I can account for is the Northwestern Hospital across the street. The \"almost every 10 minute\" ambulance arrivals were annoying at first but can't make a dent in the overall enjoyment of our stay. But this, of course, is not the fault of the hotel, so they still get top marks from me. The trick is, get a high floor room, and these sirens may fade a tad. Across the street, what luck!

It had a fold-out queen couch, two chairs, an armoir with tv and mini-bar and a business desk with ergonomic chair.. The bathroom was huge and featured marble fixtures.

At first we thought that the noise was from doors slamming but after some investigation we realized that it had to be the pipes and the water pressure. We could not take the noise so we went straight to the front desk and complained. They immediately gave us another room and that room was excellent. No noise!! The first room was on the 7th floor and our second room was on the 11th floor. I would definitely recommend the hotel just stay away from room 734.

I recommend that you take the CTA to the Clark/Division and hail a cab to the hotel. It is a great place to shop and eat. Upon arriving at the hotel, Esmerelda checked me in and was very gracious in accomodating me in a room that I would like, as well as secure my valuables in the hotel safe. This area is a very safe area and was once a bank building that has been renovated into a hotel. It is adjacent with a surgeon center and Capital Grille. Since my room wasn't quiet ready, and I was there earlier than check in time, I walked up the road for lunch at Boston Blackies....check my review out on that one. After arriving back to the hotel. and upgrading to a Corner King for $40 a night, I found the room to be comfortable. It had large windows (not floor to cieling) but large windows with a nice king size bed, a TV with limited cable channels (not a flat screen) a love seat with a coffee table (could have been updated) and a nice secretaries desk with a desk chair. The linens where very comfortable as well as the pillows and a large bathroom which the Housekeeper, Anna Marie, had prepared very nicely. The hotel offers a pool, sauna, whirlpool, steamroom and excersize equiptment. I was very nice, well kept, and the treadmills looked over the high rise buildings outside. The Bathroom had great hot water and pressure and offered Bath and Body Works True Spa amenities. The concierge desk was very helpful with accomadating me on places to eat. I booked a volunteer at the cultural center and we went on a walk. She showed me many sites, and the service is free. Book ahead and take the bus 8 blocks up the road to get there. They will give you a free day ticket on the CTA. We walked through the Theatre District, took the subway to Argyle Street and shopped at Oriental Stores and a bakery. We stopped by a post office and shipped my package back home, as well as, walked through Lincoln Park in the snow, Second City, and ended up in Old Towne. We also ate Dim Sum @ Funerama (check out my review). While in Second city I purchased a ticket for their Monday show. She gave me directions to get back to the hotel and I walked down Dearborn Street which is quiet old Chicago. Once I had breakfast at the onsite restaurant and the Lemon Meyer Pancakes with Scrambled Eggs where great. There is a great restaurant for breakfast a couple of blocks up from the hotel called the West Egg (see my review) ...The TGIF that is up the road is a place to skip totally.

The kicker.....a loud thud happening anywhere from every 5 minutes to every 10 seconds, depends on the time of day and how busy the hotel is. This constant thud was the pipes running through the hotel for water pressure. It sounded like doors slamming constantly. REALLY ANNOYING!!! My husband slept with ear plugs the second night. I was so exhausted from walking so much in the city that I only woke up a few times to the sirens. One last thing I noticed, being pregnant, didn't bother my husband, was the counter tops in the bathroom. I am 5'8 and 32 weeks pregnant, the counter hit me directly in my belly and had a difficult time using the sink or putting on makeup in the mirror. I had to sit on the counter to get anything done....also not safe if pregnant. We did not have to shell out any of our cash for the rooms, but I am disappointed that our hard earned points went to these two nights in Chicago.

We were on the 16th floor I believe and I could hear the noise but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect if you were at home and an ambulance was going down the street rather muffled. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well away from home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very conveniently located hotel so may be worth the minor noise disturbance. The room we had was an upgrade because of the By Request membership which is something you sign up for and requires no money. Of course we received the complimentary drinks and snacks requested. You have several options to choose from, we opted for the fruit bowl, green tea and water. Also, there was a large bowl of green apples at the front desk when you checked in. Much like some older hotels the front desk is on the second floor. It was a nice suite with a living area with the standard TV in an armoire and a bedroom which a pair of frosted doors closed so you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturbed. The bedroom had its own armoire with a TV. The bed was very comfortable, nice down pillows and comforter with the duvet which seems so much cleaner. The whole bedroom wall was filled with large windows with good curtains that keep out the dark. As everyone else has mentioned the bathroom was really very nice with a wonderful scale that measured your body fat and weight once you put in your height and age. The makeup mirror was great and the products aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the tiny little bottles you get even at four star hotels but medium sized Bath and Beyond items that you might give in a gift set which was a nice surprise. Overall the room was nice, clean, fresh, very satisfactory. Everyone was helpful and friendly. There were only two problems. One was the Internet which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind paying for as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that much but my daughter wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to get it hooked up. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call for assistance either and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find out until too late so that might not have been a problem. The second was that the cable stations kept going out. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call about that either though so maybe it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem for anyone else. I should mention in the morning the stations seemed fine. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use room service or try the buffet or even the restaurant though I did have drink in the bar with a friend and enjoyed the atmosphere. They had several TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with sports on though there was no noise to disturb our conversation. We sat on the couch which was nice and comfortable. The waitress was prompt and pleasant. I must add that thanks to other reviewers we avoided another problem which was using the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valet service. They charge $49.00 a night and while I understand parking is horrible in downtown Chicago right next door to them to the right was a perfectly adequate parking garage with valet service as well, 233 E. Erie Parking, phone number is (312) 255-8200 should you want to contact them before hand. The sign said they charged $39.00 on a weekend for 24 hours but the kind gentleman said there was a $5.00 discount which was applied. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about this garage. The two men were so kind and helpful. They told us we could easily get whatever we needed out of our car at any time. The convenience, service and price were unbeatable and the best thing is that there was barely a five minute wait! Also, when I accidentally left a bag beside the chair my daughter had been waiting in they marked it and had it ready when I returned twenty minutes later after having had to turn around on the Interstate and go back. If I went back to Chicago I would be very pleased to stay at this hotel and park at the same garage again though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d make it two nights instead of one there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just so much to see.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "COL333", "ReviewID": "UR20778214", "Content": "The Wyndham hotel is in a great location right next to the magnificent mile although it is a small walk to the nearest train stop.

After a while, all he said was sorry in a neutral tone; I proceeded to ask for a king size bed (instead of two double beds) and was told that none was available. (Incidently, when I went to ask the hotel attendant recommendations for restaurants in the area, he told me to ask the concierge, without even realizing that no one was staffed at the concierge desk.) I was disappointed that I was given the room right next to the elevator, especially when young children screamed nonstop in the elevator lobby when I was attempting to sleep. It goes to say that I did not exactly have a peaceful night's sleep in this hotel. What's more is that there was some rattling noise from the air conditioning. I set the room to a comfortable 70 degrees; however the level of noise was annoying, especially when you are trying to sleep. For a four star room, the beds were not as comfortable as they should be. They seemed to be \"over used.\" As for the furniture, most of it seemed worn even if it would considered to be elegant. I was also disappointed that the televisions were not plasma screens. The bathroom, however, was wonderful. Granite counters, spacious floor plan, \"spa\" toiletries, and a nice shower system helped to counter the problems with the room.

The three young women at the front desk were discussing their \"myspace\" profiles and hardly looked up when I arrived. They gave me my room key and I asked them \"is there somewhere in the hotel I can get food?\" They said \"oh yes, you can get food in the bar until 10:30!!\" I thanked them and went up to my room. They had put me in a \"suite\" but it was a smoking room and smelled TERRIBLY of smoke (I had specifically requested a non-smoking room and paid extra for it!) I went into the bathroom and found it disgustingly dirty. Someone had clearly been sick on the toilet and it had NOT been cleaned since...it was disgusting. The towels in the bathroom were also dirty, with hair stuck to them and crumpled on the hangers as if they'd been used and then hung back up. I called the front desk and the girl said she'd send someone up. I waited 10 minutes and someone showed up with a long metal pole to \"unclog the toilet\". I explained the situation to the man at the door and he told me I'd need to call back downstairs. When I did, the girl said \"I just sent someone up to unclog it!\" and I had to spell out for her what the exact nature of the probelm was. They sent someone else up 10 minutes later to clean the bathroom. The man who cleaned the bathroom said \"it' looks like somebody has been in your room since it was cleaned!\" as if it was very normal. When I finally made it down to the bar it was about 10 p.m. They told me they had stopped serving food a few minutes before. I told them I had been told they were open until 10:30. They shrugged and told me some local places that had food at this hour (there was a snowstorm...I didn't really feel like walking 5 blocks for food). I was very annoyed because I would have eaten first if I'd known they were closing. So I went to bed quite hungry (the front desk girls hadn't offered me a mini-bar key or else I would have at least had a snack) and couldn't sleep most of the night since my pillows reeked of cigarettes.

We switched our hotel last minute to the Wyndham, based on a good rate from Expedia, and the fact that my 7 year old insisted on a pool. The hotel check -in was very easy, although we were told at check-in that they could not honour our Wyndham By Request membership, since we had booked through Expedia. The front desk however, was nice enough to give us a \"club room\" on the 16th floor, without the benefits of the club services. We found the room to be more than adequate. It appeared to have new carpet, 2 double beds with duvet bedding and a small tv. Being that we were there during Spring Break, the hotel was packed with other families, and the pool was jammed with kids - much to my chagrin , however to my kids' delight. I think my ears are still ringing with the sound of kids screaming and the roar of the jacuzzi! Our concierge \"Russell\" was very helpfull with suggestions. TIP: If you plan to go to the Rain Forest Cafe, make sure to phone in advance reservations! Playing it by ear cost us 1.5 hours of wait time!!!! Overall- we found the hotel to be nice enough to return, and more than deserving of their 3.5 star rating. We did not eat breakfast in the cafe, instead used the miniscule coffee maker to heat water for our instant oatmeal, and hot cocoa. 2nd note: the club floor bathrooms must be designed for very tall people. My 7 year old couldn't reach the bathroom sink. Luckily she has great balance, so we inverted the plastic trash can and used it as a 'step stool\". We also loved the shampoos and soaps provided by the hotel. I also liked the make-up mirror in the bathroom. My kid thought the first floor lobby was very fancy - although from a space planning point it seems inefficient since you either have to climb the grand stairs, or take an elevator to get to the lobby!

However, the bellman and others working the street were helpful and anxious to get our bags out of the snow and into the hotel. Upon check-in at about 2:30 p.m. we were told no rooms were available with the 2 double beds we had requested. They were going to give us a room with a King and a hide-a-bed. Having done that already this trip, we opted to stand firm and wait until a room with 2 double beds became available. The person at the front desk was pleasant and figured out a way to make it happen. I over-heard the person next to me checking in though. She did not stand firm in her request and was given a room with a King and a hide-a-bed, which didn't make her happy. We strolled around downtown Chicago, enjoying all it has to offer, so the time went quickly. When I returned at 4 p.m. as requested, the room was ready and our bags were quickly delivered to the room by a very pleasant bell hop. The room is nice - comfortable bedding and soft towels. Most of the hooks holding the shower curtain were not hooked, so I fixed that while in the shower. We were also not given 2 soaps, so had to use the small one from the sink area for everyone to shower with. And there was no shampoo, only conditioner. All in all, no major problems, but just a lack of attention to detail. We had everything with us to get ready for the day, so I did not ask housekeeping to deliver more soap.

After booking our room, I immediately signed up to be a \"Wyndham-by-request\" member, so that our stay would be extra special. Upon arrival to the hotel, however, I quickly learned that despite my \"by-request\" membership, I was instead going to forever be \"the guest who paid through Priceline.\" This was pointed out to me by more than one Wyndham employee (very politely) . . . like I needed reminding or something. Because of the way we booked, we were denied all of the perks that other \"by-request\" members automatically received. In addition, I saw that all of the other guests were enjoying complimentary breakfasts at the hotel's buffet - but not us. That being said, I crunched the numbers and discovered that even if we had purchased each of the extras that were complimentary to other \"by-request\" members, we would have still come out ahead by booking through Priceline. The upside: We stayed on the 6th floor, facing west, which was nice since the hospital, and all of the emergency sirens, were on the north side across the street. The room was surpisingly large, with an oversized bathroom. Very nice! The bed linens were oh-so-comfy. The housekeeping staff was prompt and efficient. The hotel lobby was beautiful, with a winding staircase leading to the check-in desk on the 2nd floor. All-in-all, it was a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing environment. The downside? The carpet in our room was wrinkling (poor installation) and the TV looked older than my 1999 discount-store no-name cheapie. The room's walls didn't block alot of noise from adjacent rooms. The work-out room on the 4th floor was small and had bad views of nearby rooftops. The pool was teeny-tiny: maybe 10' x 17' - about the size of two lap-lanes at my community center. The hot tub was average size. Due to the crowds, we didn't use any of these amenities. The Wyndham is located just one block from the Magnificant Mile shopping corridor, super convenient. We were walking distance from everything. We would shop, then swing by the hotel to drop off our stuff, and shop some more. We were a 15-minute walk from the Navy Pier (tourist trap), and a 6-minute bus ride from the The Chicago Institute of Art (must see!). I found the Wyndham was an affordable way to enjoy Chicago during a very busy time of year (courtesy of Priceline!). It was a pleasant hotel with a great location. But if someone wanted to visit Chicago, and was willing to pay top-dollar, regular rates, I would strongly suggest staying somewhere else.

All the employee's were very nice & always said hello. The room was great. We got a room with two queen size beds, which by the way were very comfortable. The comforter itself was to die for. (I don't know about the reviews stating to much noise, we never had a problem) The location was perfect. It's with-in walking distance to just about everything. Magnificent Mile is two blocks from the hotel. There are several bars, restaurants, 7-11's and delis around as well. Valet parking tells you to call them 30 minutes in advance which was true on Saturday but every other day it only took 15-20 minutes. And we've stayed @ several hotels in Chicago and that's pretty good. I am a referring travel agent with YTB and would recommend this hotel to any one of my client's.

I finally called the number listed for web rate information and she helped me get the rooms I wanted. We got a corner king which I heartily recommend and a double room for the kids. The corner king was huge, and had non-rectangle dimensions, almost like a triangle. We had windows that covered one entire wall facing the front of the hotel. Yes, the sirens were constant but we got used to them after a while and they did die down by bedtime. They never woke me up and I am a light sleeper. The corner king room had a sofa bed as well which I wasn't expecting. The bathroom was huge as well but a bit cold for me and no way to heat it up. The temperature in the main room was easy to adjust however. The room had a large entry way with a table and lamp and large closet. The tv was in the typical armoire with minibar and coffee set up. There was a nice desk and ergonomic desk chair and a coffee table in front of the sofa. Even with the sofabed pulled out, the room was still spacious. We were very happy with our room. This room was large enough that the five of us could hang out without feeling cramped, then at bedtime, the kids went to their own room which was just around the corner from ours. Their double double room was a little cramped but their bathroom was a nice size. Our beds were very comfortable. We did not use the restaurant as it was a bit pricey for a family of five. The bar was a very happening place the Monday night we arrived. We also did not use the concierge for anything but they always greeted us as we walked by. The pool area was small but big enough for a nice swim and the gym was a nice amenity. We ate breakfast at a place kitty corner to the hotel called Corner Bakery and there was a Friday's Restaurant a block away that the kids enjoyed. They also insisted on walking to Dunkin Donuts a block or so away. Michigan Avenue shopping is literally a short block away and that was the main reason I chose this hotel. We walked one evening to the Hancock Observatory, not far away at all. Parking was $44 a night and they add it to your final bill. We tried different ways of getting about. One time we left the hotel and then parked at the museums and that cost $15. The next day my husband thought he'd save money by taking a cab to another museum but it was $20 each way. It would have been cheaper to take the car out of the garage. Next time we'll explore public transportation! I liked having the car in the hotel lot but you cannot access it at whim.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try room service nor did we at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really comment on them. POSITIVES: The location; only a block off of Michigan Ave. the hotel is in a prime area of town. NEGATIVES: Noise from the hospital; No free internet (+/- $11/day) MY OVERALL IMPRESSION: I would never pay full-price for this hotel; however I am satisfied with my stay and feel that I got my money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth. MY RECOMMENDATIONS: -Request an upper-floor room away from the hospital side of the hotel. -Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay full price.", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201c4th Time--Still Love the Wyndham\u201d", "Author": "evans045", "ReviewID": "UR6925449", "Content": "My daughter and I have been staying at the Wyndham each winter for 5 years now, with one interruption when we tried the Omni.

The concierge gave us contradictory information on transportation to O'Hare Airport, but it all worked out in the end. An interesting fact: I had paid in advance and I wasn't supposed to see how much they charged priceline.com for the room, but they inadvertently slipped a notice under my door. Priceline had paid them $76 (plus tax). I found the fact that you had to take two elevators (or walk up one flight of stairs and then take an elevator up to your room) mildy annoying (especially if you're loaded with shopping bags), but for the price I won't complain.

The hotel is located just off Michigan Ave, so you're close to the hustle and bustle without being right in it. Additionally, Navy Pier is an easy walk to the SE of the hotel. The hotel itself offers a nice first impression, with an elegant (if not stuffy) lobby area. Check-in was pleasant and easy. Despite being just by myself, I was given two beds because that's all they had left. Fine enough, as I figured that the 2-bed room would have more space. Sure enough, the room was one of the bigger non-suite rooms I've seen in the city. The room had just about zero flair whatsoever, but its \"understated\" look worked well enough. Beds were surprisingly springy (in a good way) and the Herman Miller chair at the workdesk was comfortable (if shockingly expensive in the catalog in the room.) The bathroom was quite nice, with a large sink area and the toilet and shower tucked away a little further back. Wasn't interested in anything on the room service menu - either in terms of price or content - so went to Corner Bakery, which is a very nice restaurant (if you like one of them, know that it's a chain and that there's more scattered around the city.) Elevators seemed slow upon arrival, but things were a little more crowded at this point of the evening and a crowd gathered around the elevator and settled in for a rather long wait. Upon return, also noticed that there's surprisingly limited selection of cable channels here - mainly news. No MTV (not a huge MTV fan, but was surprised that it wasn't included.) Next morning, I notice a charge on in the TV menu that is just about the same (slightly less) charge as my Priceline bid. I guess that maybe it's what Priceline paid for the room. I ask at check-out if there are any charges at all on the room. The person at check-out looks me up, confirms my name and room (so there's no chance she's looking at the wrong person) and tells me that there are absolutely no charges owed. Three days later, the same charge shows up on my bill. I call the hotel, expecting that this will be taken care of in a professional, prompt manner (as it has been when it's occured at other hotels in the city). Less than 30 seconds after the representative picked up, she'd already transfered me. No apology. Front desk (where i was transferred to) seemed annoyed, interrupted me when I was trying to tell her the situation and transferred me to the manager's message machine. Furious - because it's not my mistake and I don't want to be the one to have to spend my time trying to chase after them to fix it - I write Priceline and both call and write Wyndham Corporate, who would do absolutely nothing besides forward a claim to the hotel and that let me know that it would take a ridiculous 5 business days for the hotel to investigate. Sure enough, 5 business days go by, norhing's done and I'm furious. Meanwhile, I've heard nothing from the hotel. After 7 business days, I filed a chargeback and eventually, the hotel refunded me, but they never communicated with me at all about the refund - it just appeared.

(5) There are no views of anything except the walls of other buildings. So if views are your thing, you'll need to stay elsewhere. (6) It's nearly $11 PER 24 hour period to use the internet. This should be a courtesy. Now the good. (1) The staff (although minimal) were extremely friendly, greeted me with a smile and the service was prompt for the most part in terms of concierge and desk reception. I believe had I requested to move to another floor they would have accomodated me. They provided lots of apples at the front desk. (2) There is a GREAT whirlpool, sauna, excercise room and steamroom. The water pressure is in working order. (3) The rooms were VERY clean and VERY nice. No complaints. (4) If you like shopping, the location is ideal. It's two very short blocks from the Magnificent Mile, 3 minute run to the beach trail and a 10 min walk to the subway. As a runner, I would stay here again but on a different, non-smokey floor.

I booked the special \"Take Your Daughter to Chicago - American Girl Package,\" which offered a rate of $169.00 a night for a standard room, a $100 savings over the regular room rate. I booked a room with 2 double beds, as we thought our son might want to stay with us. The package included a Wyndham bathrobe which fits an American Girl doll. When I checked in, I discovered that the hotel had changed our reserved room with 2 double beds to one with only a king sized bed, because that was my preference when I joined Wyndham ByRequest. If we wanted our son to stay with us, we had to pay a $20 a night fee for a rollaway bed. I was tired after driving almost 600 miles that day and didn't have the energy to protest. I did not get any kind of upgrade for being a ByRequest member, although I did get a free small bottle of wine and a cheese and cracker snack. Our room was on the 8th floor, and was on the small side, but was adequate. As a ByRequest member, I did not have to pay the $10.99 fee for internet access. The room had a queen sized bed (NOT the promised king sized bed), a small sitting area with a chair and a desk, and a refrigerator/mini bar. It was clean and quiet; I did hear a conversation from a guest in the next room, but did not hear any street noise. My son decided not to stay with us, so I asked the front desk to remove the rollaway bed about an hour after it had been delivered. This was done promptly, but when I checked out, I was charged $40.00 for 2 night's use, which I had to ask to be removed from the bill. When we first went to our room (around 4 pm), there was a full bottle of beer in the hall by the door and there were dirty dishes and an empty beer box outside several other rooms which were not cleared until the next day. Housekeeping is quite slow; on the second day of our stay, our room was not cleaned until almost 4 pm. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of shopping and many area attractions. I highly recommend the delicious food at the Corner Bakery, located across the street. Overall, this hotel was fine, but it is really not a 4 star hotel.

I've stayed at the Embassy Suites down the street which is also a good choice and the Doubletree on Delaware as well as a Courtyard near the loop and the Palmer House Hilton. For my money, the Wyndham (booking on the internet with an internet rate) has offered the best combination of location, value for the dollar and service. My only complaint would be that the rooms are much too dark. Lighting is low and they are decorated in dark colors. Of course, this means some dirt doesn't get spotted by the housekeeping staff, but my rooms have been as clean as any of the full service hotels that I've stayed at in Chicago. None of them have been perfect (I have a low tolerance for dirt) but they've been acceptable. If you drive, understand that they charge you $30 to park your car. You can self park for less at the lot by the Embassy Suites a couple of blocks away if you're so inclined. The pool area is older but nicely maintained. The gym is nothing spectacular but it's much better than those at competing hotels in the area. As for the location, for the leisure traveler it's great. Navy Pier and the lakeshore are within walking distance and Michigan Avenue is only two blocks from your front door. There are also many good restaurants at all price points within two to three blocks of the hotel. Although, with so many good choices in Chicago, I'd recommend investing in a cab and venturing out.

My main problem was the reception staff who were seemingly disinterested in their guests, their manner was hardly welcoming. Also some of the Concierge staff had the same attitude except a guy called Ryan who was helpful.

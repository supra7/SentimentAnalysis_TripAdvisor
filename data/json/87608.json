I had a south facing view of the Chicago River and Willis Tower, which was incredible. The room was nice and very comfortable, especially the bed and linens. The hotel staff, including front desk, bell staff, concierge, housekeeping and room service, were all very professional, friendly and efficient. The only drawbacks were the television reception, which was very slow and lots of static. This did not really bother me as i only turned on the tv one of the 7 days; however, others did complain about this. The restaurant/room service is pricey, but to be expected for downtown location. This hotel is conveniently located to great restaurants, shopping and sites. You can easily walk or take a quick cab ride to any place you want to go.

He suggested the hotel bar for dining as they have a great view of the city on the 15th floor. I did go to the bar area and the food was very good and the view spectacular.

I had friends that stayed here over the weekend, and it was perfect! (I didn't stay here, but I did visit them, saw their room, wandered around the hotel, and used the concierge service with them). I think the hotel is in a great location. It's easy to get anywhere downtown, in river north, or off the brown line. This place has amazing views! The views from the rooms are stunning, the views from the bar are incredible, the views from random areas in the lobby are outstanding. Really, the view is that great. The room was nice. I think what makes this place amazing is the staff. I got a flat on my bike on the way to visiting them. Since there are no gas stations particularly close, I thought I would see if the hotel's garage had an air compressor/some type of pump. We asked the concierge. The concierge called the engineer, but didn't get a response, so he called the nearby Ace Hardware and quoted me 2 pumps. We didn't get to Ace until they had closed. So when we returned from dinner we asked the concierge to ask the engineer again. He called the engineer down to meet with us. The engineer was able to blow up the tire. The staff were so friendly and so helpful! My friends had a great time, and plan to stay here again anytime they need a hotel in the city in the future!

Entrance is through the very grand foyer, then into an elevator to the fifteenth floor hotel lobby. This too is very stylish, but from there it's downhill. The room was just Holiday Inn average and looked like a refurb wouldn't have hurt. It's hard to be sure though because the lighting was pretty bad. The view was probably quite dramatic, but it was hard to tell because the window seemed not to have been washed since 2003. Two other grumbles are that the walls are pretty thin, so keep your voice down, and the heater was very loud. On the plus side, the bathroom was very good - clean and modern with a good shower and a tub that drained well. Another definite plus is the pool - big enough to swim laps and like the bathroom, spotless. And the location is good, right next to the Merchandise Mart and about a seven minutes walk along the river to Michigan Avenue. Self-park is available just in front of the hotel, and at $39 with unlimited in-out it's actually a pretty good deal for downtown Chicago. One weird thing that I feel compelled to mention: some time after midnight my wife and I were woken by the room moving. Yes, seriously, the floor and our bed seemed to be bouncing up and down, which was a little alarming. I thought about calling the front desk but I wasn't sure what to say ... \"excuse me but my bed is bouncing\"?

We asked for a room with a view, used points for the stay, and the view was spectacular. WE took some great photos, and it was beautiful and night and day. I think since it is right by the water that thee can't be a building right next to it, so the views are better than a lot of hotels, also due to fact that the hotel is up on high floors (starting at 15th floor, I think). So, PROS 1- views 2- access to public transportation, you have to walk a bit, but you don't have to go outside (if you go to CVS about a block away, you can purchase a day pass for subway, train, etc. for about 5 dollars- good deal). 3- free wifi 4- value for the room for Chicago is good 5 extra treat bag if platinum member 6 access to taxis- there's always several there, and to get to most places downtown (aquarium, field museum, etc) should only cost you about ten dollars and take about 15 minutes or less. Sometimes this is really easier than trying to take public transportation, since you are relatively close to a lot of stuff 7 concierge is very helpful- let them help you- you don't need to figure out the subway map, etc. Either use walking Garmin GPS or ask concierge instead of looking at maps online, etc. CONS- Getting luggage to room- they have a bellman if you want to pay, though. Strongly suggest you pull car over at entrance (you can leave for 15 minutes of so) and take luggage up from there. You have to go in lobby, take one elevator to 15th floor, then go through hotel lobby to another set of elevators to go to room. Sounds harder than it is, but much better if you have rolling luggage. Don't park the car and then take luggage up steps, etc just to get back to lobby entrance- that'll wear you out. Parking- although to be honest parking is expensive everywhere- it costs about 40 a day- but you can come and go as you please. Just remember to take ticket to registration at check in so they can validate it- don't leave in the car. Then they can put charges for it and link it to your credit card on file so it will get paid automatically. There are some other surface lots we could see from our room, but they don't look easy to get to, and I am not sure how much cheaper they would be. Parking everywhere is expensive unless you can find a meter downtown (good luck with that). It's just the going rate there, and I'm from Kentucky so it was bit of a shock. WE found that combination of taxis and public transport was cheaper than trying to take car around city and pay parking. no free breakfast- not a holiday inn express, but I often get free voucher for breakfast at holiday inn with platinum status. Not a big deal, though. We are connected to a plaza that has Dunkin Donuts, Au Bon Pain, etc. and that is fine if you want to save money and not use room service, etc. All in all, a good stay. Great room, good value for price anyway, and convenient to a lot of downtown Chicago compared to staying outside city. You can stay out in suburbs to save money, but you will have to fight traffic and still eat significant parking charges (like 25 for two hours, etc.), so this is easier.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cClean, quiet and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "WallyDog", "ReviewID": "UR118420331", "Content": "Our room was clean and comfortable with a spectacular view.

Cityscape Bar next to reception is a pleasant place to people watch, or catch a game on TV, or simply take in the surrounding Chicago buildings. There is no doubt it is a dramatic place to enjoy an drink. However, the drinks are somewhat expensive, most beers are $7.00 or more. You do need to be careful with your card keys, as any magnetic source, even your phone, will erase these, and you will then have to go to reception to get the card renewed. This also goes for the parking ticket. The hotel is surrounded by bars and restaurants so don't worry about getting food and drink at good value prices while staying here. Just in front of the express elevators leading up to the reception is a small store, which sells deli food and drink as well as a selection of gifts. The parking charge is excessive, though in keeping with the rest of the city, where parking spaces are at a premium. Interestingly, having read sheilaUpholland's review, we were charged $36.00 per night for self parking rather than $38.00. Despite these extra costs the hotel is well situated, the rooms spacious and pleasant with great views in most, and the staff visible, friendly, helpful and efficient. So I would have to recommend this hotel if you are staying in Chicago.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big Canoe, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Experience\u201d", "Author": "523HappyTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR118289068", "Content": "My wife and I were attending a reunion of her hospital unit from the Vietnam War era; attended by more than 90 people.We had a river view room with a queen bed.

So when Holiday Inn revamped and re-emerged in recent years, I avoided the chain! Well, I may have to reconsider after my experience here. It was great! The hotel is nice with a great Asian flavor restaurant and a bar area with all windows--great city views. The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Chicago for shopping, dining, and the merchandise/design area. Rooms are nice--not luxury but updated and very comfortable. Ask for a room on a high floor (I was on 21st floor) to enjoy the AMAZING city lights! It's right on the river so it's pretty during the day as well. One evening my classmate and I needed to get a lot of work done so did not want to spend an hour or so going to eat dinner at a restaurant. I called downstairs to ask if we could order food and come down to get it in order to use our 15% member discount and to avoid room service fees. I was told yes. However, once I arrived there had been a misunderstanding and we were charged as though the food had been prepared and brought to our room. I politely relayed that I did not understand this and within minutes of returning to my room a manager called me and brought a refund and restaurant coupon up to my room. Very nice! It's sooooo nice to get this kind of response when I didn't even have to gripe or be mean. The manager explained that they appreciate my membership in the Holiday Inn rewards club and they'd of course rather have us eating food here than ordering food elsewhere. Good overall experience.

Tony immediately appreciated our predicament and ensured that we would be well accomodated for our stay to meet each family members needs, and also went above and booked us an additional night at our request, at a discounted rate - which unfortunately I later had to cancel (as I was ill and we ended our travel plans rather abruptly) with no difficulty at all. I could not have asked for better customer service. Our room was spectacular, the views were enthralling and the room was far better than expected, a Junior Suite.

I was scheduled to speak at a meeting at the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in downtown Chicago on Friday, February 4th. As a result, I was doing a scan of all the mid-priced hotels that were within walking distance. Once I had narrowed my search down to 2 or 3 hotels, I went to TripAdvisor to check out the recent reviews and ratings. All of the ratings for January for were VERY positive, but there were two ratings in mid-December that caused me some concern. I was, however, impressed that the Hotel Manager had responded to all of the comments, both positive and not so, and that he had included his email address in one of them so that the rater could contact him to discuss her concerns further. I decided to take advantage of the email address and sent my own email, expressing both interest and concern. I decided to include my phone number after my signature in case anyone cared enough to follow-up either by email or phone. (I have to admit at this point that I am a Customer Service Director and as actually baiting them a bit.) Less than an hour later, I received a phone call from someone I am presuming to be one of the Assistant Hotel Managers (maybe the Reservations Manager). We played phone tag for a good part of the afternoon, but he (Carlisle) never gave up. We discussed the property and the comments that the reviewers had made in December. By the time we had finished our conversation, I had no qualms at all about making a reservation, and did. Carlisle even insisted that I look him up once we arrived at the hotel. I was really looking forward to our stay at that point. Unfortunately, the record snowfall in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 1st, which then moved into southeast Michigan, caused me to change my plans, as I had been planning to drive to Chicago. I called and left a message in the Carlisle's voicemail on Wednesday asking about their cancellation policy as the meeting organizer and I were scheduled to speak Thursday to make a \"go/no go\" decision. I received a call back from him as soon as he arrived in his office on Thursday morning. When I asked him how his \"local\" drive had been, he responded that it was \"only by the grace of God.\" That actually triggered me to make my final decision as I didn't want to put my husband I through 200+ miles of \"only by the grace of God\" driving. Although I wasn't able to actually stay at their property on this trip, I have already committed and will have no qualms about staying there on my next visit because \"Carlisle\" and \"Charnita\" (reservations) convinced me that they care about my business, even though I'm only one lone traveller. Well maintained facilities are important and from the reviews it sounds as if they are (much above your average Holiday Inn) but the attitude of the employees and the service they provide from top to bottom is what will really make or break a stay at any property.

I definitely don't view a hotel as 'just a place to sleep in' - especially durng a multi-day stay. Both my bf and I really enjoy nice rooms with great views, so when Hotwire revealed to me that I had received the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza, my heart sank a little. It had been a long time since I stayed at a Holiday Inn and I was not looking forward to a potentially low-quality hotel experience. After I had reviewed the room choices on the website I phoned well ahead of our arrival date and spoke with a front desk associate. She was very friendly and was more than happy to offer us payable upgrade to a 'Executive King Suite' for an extra $50 USD a night. It was WELL worth it. I absolutely recommed upgrading any time you book through a third party website. We arrived extremely late on our first night because we had to go after our 5pm work day was over. Fortunately the streets were basically deserted so driving in the city was effortless. The Mart Plaza is very conveniently located close to the highway turn off, I feel like I only had to make three or four turns in the city before I was there. The self-parking was easy. The lot had survallance cameras and I was able to get a spot right under a lightpost so I felt more than comfortable leaving my car out in public. Check in was quick (though it was after 1am by the time we got there so there was obviously not going to be a lot of other travellers). The lobby is nice, but I've certainly seen better. Still, for being a renovated part of a office building - they did a pretty decent job. Our room furniture-wise was nothing to run home about, but the amount of space was fantastic. We had a desk, flat screen television, a small two person dining table, a couch, coffee table, and a king size bed. What really made our stay was the absolutely divine view. Truly gorgeous. We had a panoramic view (the room was at the corner of the building) of the city and it honestly took our breath away no matter what time of day it was. I also REALLY appreciated the free internet! Not enough hotels in Canada offer that! Our only complaint would have been the concierge. He didn't really seem to take my bf or I seriously. At one point his directions sent us 20 minutes away from where we needed to be. It completely ruined one full days agenda which was obviously disappointing. My goodness though, Chicago may be called the 'second city' but it's second to none. So much to see and do. My bf and I actually ran out of time. There was so much we could have still seen and done. We didn't even get time to shop which is very unlike us. We were too busy with the trolly tours, boat tours, museums, parks, fountains, Navy Pier. We had a fantastic time and our wonderfully situated room at the Mart Plaza really complimented the stay.

Arrving in Chicago you can walk from the Amtrak station, take a taxi or from the airports take the L train to Clark/Lake and walk over from there, or transfer to the Brown line and do hardly any walking at all. In inclement weather this is a nice option. Now on to the hotel itself. The hotel occupies the higher floors of the MM so once there, take the lobby elevators to the 15th floor for checkin. Employees at front desk have always seemed friendly and professional to me. The view: I do have an issue with the random treatment when it comes to booking a \"room with a view.\" I have received nicer views when booking through an opaque site than when booking the hotel direct; I guess it all depends on availability.

The rooms are clean and comfortable, with the upgraded HI bedding you will get a very restful night's sleep before your big day, whatever that might involve.

The onsite restaruant has excellent food, ambience and service, with a \"kids eat free\" bonus but you have to remember to stop at the checkin desk before (or after) the meal to get the coupon. Not sure why they don't just offer this at checkin. The hotel is connected via walkway to the Merchandise Mart which has a food court including Dunkin Donuts, McD's, Arbys, and other chains that can be helpful for getting a quick and inexpensive meal so you can splurge on another meal at the hotel or elsewhere in the Windy City. also a Starbucks.

The hotel lobby was on the 15th floor. It had a nice open atrium, surrounded by sterile-looking corridors of rooms, overlooking the lobby, up to the 23rd floor. The lobby, hotel restaurant and cocktail bar were all very nice. Check in was seamless. Staff was polite but not overly friendly. I had an erroneous room service charge to my account but they promptly removed it at checkout. As with any other hotel in downtown Chicago, parking rate was very expensive ($37 a night). So walking, taxi or public transportation would be the best way to get around. There was a pool and pretty large exercise room. The pool was about 2/3 size of a lap pool. I did not try the onsite restaurant or bar, as there were lots of great places to eat within walking distance. Accommodation The room itself looked newly renovated and was fairly large. Furniture and decorations were very plain. Carpet and bathroom were clean. The bed and pillows were reasonably comfortable. There was very little noise. Plus the way my room was situated, I did not hear any street noise (e.g. police sirens), which is unusual for any downtown hotel. The room had a single-serving coffee maker. No mini-refrigerator, safe, or closet. The HDTV was a nice touch but no DVD player. No wired Internet access.

The hotel lobby is very nice and serene. Tthe bathrooms have been remolded since my last stay in September and they are very nice, they have bath and body works products in the rooms which is a nice touch The location is very nice easy to get around and walk to places. The view is absolutely beautiful especially at night. CVS and Subway is right around the corner from the hotel. They also have restaurant that you can walk to call Merchandise Mart there is a food court there where you can eat as well. This time we walked everywhere and my legs were so sore but it was well worth the stay. Phyllis at the front desk is awesome she is so nice and friendly and helps you out however she can. We always go to the pool area but the water is a little too cold for my liking and I also feel that they should put a hot tub in to make your stay more pleasurable. The swiiming pool is a nice pool and it has see through roof so the sun shines in, but the water temperture is still to cold for me.. The inside of the pool area is warm, but not real hot to where you want to jump in a cold pool. We did eat at the restaurant for breakfast and the food is very good but it is very pricey. We saw the room service menu and it caters to Italisias which I think is the name of the restaurant but no common food items that you want at least not me.

When we pulled up in front of the \"hotel\", we realized we were pulling up in front of an office building. The hotel starts on the 14th floor. So...if you want to run in and check in but leave older teenagers in the car until you get a room key...impossible to do. The option to unload luggage at the front door is fine IF you feel comfortable leaving a family member with it while you park in the lot and then walk up 2 flights of stairs, or you can park and drag your luggage up the steps yourself (which is what we did), then take the elevator to the 14th floor to the hotel, then take a different elevator to your room, or you can park all the way at the bottom of the garage and take a hallway to an elevator (handicapped route) which I chose not to do because of the time of night we arrived. All this to say that it was just very inconvenient. The pluses were: The front desk staff, and information desk people were very friendly, and the view from our room was fantastic. Our room was just O.K, cleanish, but we had to call maintenance since our toilet wouldn't flush. Evidentally someone before us had flushed a bar of soap. The restaurant that we went to was a bad experience. As the waiter was putting my child's plate down, half the food slid off onto the table. The waiter acted as if nothing had happened, did not offer to get a new meal, did not appologize, nothing. I should have asked for a replacement, but it was very late, we'd been driving for 16 hours, and so my son just ate the food that hadn't fallen off. After we paid, and walked away, and I guess after discovering that I hadn't tipped him, the waiter began yelling and cussing that this was 'the second time....\" This was actually a bit scary especially to my children.

The beds were okay, but the pillows were great, and we got a \"pillow menu\" in case we needed different types of pillows. The hotel occupies the top 9 floors above the Chicago Sun Times building, and we were on the 21st floor. We were on the back side of the hotel and had a great view of the Hancock tower just to our right. The service we received in this hotel was wonderful. James checked us in and he couldn't be nicer. The concierge (Robert? Richard?) was so welcoming. He answered all of our questions and had information about how to get places, what to see and where to eat (we never made it to the restaurants he recommended, though, as there was a McDonald's on almost every block and my husband is not very adventurous when it comes to food). I did not use the exercise room, but it looked well-appointed. The pool was a little bit chilly, but not too bad. The hotel is in a great location. We had a 15 minute walk to Michigan Ave. in one direction and a 15 minute walk from the Sears (Willis) tower in another. We walked almost everywhere (we took a water taxi a few times), and didn't fear for our safety (except from the crazy cab drivers that were EVERYWHERE). The hotel is right next to the Merchandise Mart which has a lot of very high end home decorating shops and some restaurants and snack shops. Parking was $31 a night and although we didn't check in until 5 on Tuesday, we were able to leave the car there for a full 48 hours, which allowed us to do some sight seeing for a few hours after we checked out on Wednesday (Wendella offers a great architectural boat tour). We are priority/preffered members (free to join), so we got a coupon at check-in that gave us the choice of 15% off a meal at the restaurant or $5 a day off of parking. We chose the $$ off of parking. The only negative thoughts I have about this hotel were 1) it seemed rather small for the price, but I guess that's to be expected in a large city such as Chicago, 2) the hotel restaurant was a bit pricey ($11.95 for a continental breakfast???), and 3) the water temperature in the shower fluctuated so much that I spent more time adjusting the temp than I did actually showering. I will stay at this hotel again the next time we visit Chicago. Instead of driving, though, I would find a cheap flight. That way we would avoid having to pay to park, and having to drive in city traffic or on any of the freeways near the city.

Housekeeping was spotty, and they forgot to replace our amenities half of our stay. Room service is offered (costly), but many of the local restaurants deliver. Your food options are limited after 9pm as you are in the business district. There is a nice deli on the ground floor of the building that makes fresh sandwiches, salads, soups, and also sells sundry goods, but they close around 8pm or earlier.

There is a literal hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant about 3 blocks away called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eat, Drink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they have virtually no place to sit, but they sell good cheap Chinese food, and they deliver too.

The lobby, bar and restaurant are located here. Check in was very easy, the staff was very friendly and nice. The bar had a nice view of the city and the drinks were delivered very promptly.

Just as in my previous review, the restaurant staff is amazing. Everyone is so pleasant, helpful and genuinely happy to be working in their hotel. Dined in Cityscape Friday night and fell completely in love with Tony Miu's Zentini, a wicked combination of Skyy Citrus, Zen Green Tea Liqueur and lime juice, followed by an equally wicked Grand Pandaro Cheese Pasta, all while watching the beautiful night skyline along the river. Earlier in the day we had watched the Chicago Police boats going back and forth past Wolf Point and the river tour boats have already started service. Wish it had been warmer so we could have enjoyed some outdoor activity too. This trip we got to the gym and were very impressed with the equipment available. Everything was spotlessly clean to begin with and there were wipes and sprays available to clean the equipment before and after use, which gives great peace of mind. There's stacks of fresh clean towels and a convenient spot to drop the soiled towels, so everything stays invitingly clean, unlike many gyms.There is also a very nice sauna in the same area, but we hadn't thought to bring swimwear this trip, so no pool - no sauna. Next time for certain! Cityscape was a verrrry popular spot for Earth Hour so alas, we thought we'd have a better view from our room. We settled in front of the expanse of windows and watched as the lights went off in many downtown landmarks. It was gratifying to see how many people became involved in the energy saving movement, including, of course, the hotel who even doused the parking lot lighting.

We arrived a bit before checkin, but the early check in was not a problem for the desk clerk. She quickly found the reservation and sent us up to our room, which was on the 22nd floor as I recall. When I called in the reservation, I remember talking with an operator who tried to talk me out of getting the room with a view; she said that just about all of the rooms have a wonderful view and that it probably wouldn't be necessary to pay extra for that feature. Somehow, though, I read \"room with a view\" to be \"corner room\". Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed it was not. Don't get me wrong, the view was still great (see the photo with this review), but I don't think it was anything for which I needed to pay extra. The room was clean and seemed a bit roomier than most hotel rooms in which I am accustomed to staying. Housekeeping did a great job every day. Everything looked great. It is a standard hotel room; I mean it's clean, had a great view, and you're in Chicago, so how much time will you actually be spending in your room? Pool seemed a bit cool, as others have noted. It also was a bit too crowded for my liking, so I didn't get to enjoy it too much. Again, as others noted, the food prices looked quite a bit too high to justify eating in the hotel, but again, you're going to be in Chicago. Get outside of the hotel. Do go to the bar at least once during your stay; the view is absolutely magnificent. I could justify drink prices that were a bit higher for that view--right at the fork of the Chicago River. The open air courtyard was nice. It was relaxing and the open feel was nice to see when leaving the room. I was quite tempted to get some of those little plastic soldiers with parachutes and drop a bunch of them to see them fall down to the courtyard, but thankfully, was talked out of it. The hotel is accessible via enclosed walkways all the way from the brown line station (Merchandise Mart). Some previous reviews I read noted that the walkway wasn't open on the weekends. I didn't find that to be the case, but it seemed as though there was a special event going on that weekend, so I'm not sure if that was a fluke or a new rule. Finally, I gave 5/5 for value. Since the stay I'm reviewing in Dec. 2008, it appears as though the hotel has raised it rates and substantially. If I'd paid the current amount for the room, I'd probably give it a 4/5 for value. The location is right near the heart of Chicago, yet far enough away that you're not awakened by sirens and/or traffic and/or trains.

We did not swim in the pool but it was very pretty. The view from the room was very nice with city lights. However, we stayed on the west side of the buliding facing away from the lake and city, and I think the view would be even better from the east side. The truly amazing thing about this place is the value. The public rate on the room was pretty reasonable for being in the city. The amazing thing is the AAA discount which was over 40%. I am already a AAA member, but even if I was not, I would have saved over $100 on our three night stay even after incurring the cost of joining AAA.

The first night's rate was very reasonable, but nights #2-4 were nearly double. Other comments about the difficulty in finding the hotel are well founded; the signage is inadequate. Exiting the elevator on the 15th floor, where the hotel begins, one is met with NO signs or personnel, just some construction work in progress. Turning the corner, though, and you can find your own way to the reception. At that point you realise that the HI signature dining room beneath the atrium is not there, or at least it isn't finished, so meals are served in two other locations. The bar overlooking the city is very pleasant, though you should check carefully what you order, and not assume you'll be given a promotion/cut-price drink unless you explicitly ask for it. The rooms are adequate in terms of amenities, and the exercise room/indoor pool really quite nice. But the major drawbacks are - apart from the dining issues - the constant rumble/occasional roar from the trains etc. below the hotel, and the workers who began their hammering at 6:50 am. To make the most of its location, the hotel needs a signifcant upgrade on its double/triple glazing, and either it should close while construction is underway, or it should warn the guests and require its building workers to hold off until, say, 8 am. Personally, I was disappointed, and I checked out by 8:30 am, finding another Chicago hotel for the same price that was drastically better on every level except the absence of a pool. By the way, don't use the internet facility in the rooms - they have obsolete software, and many major sites (including, ironically, orbitz.com) can't be accessed. When I complained about this, I was refunded the cost, but other than that there was only a half-hearted apology from the front desk.

Also, the staff was very friendly and concierge \"Robert\" was helpful with restaurant recommendations and can get you last minute tickets to shows or the Cubs. If you can afford it, stay next time at a hotel that is closer to Miracle Mile, the Pier, or Millennium Park.

Staff: Everyone we spoke to was very helpful. The lady who checked us in was quite miserable, but nevertheless they all seemed ok. Hotel: The hotel itself was OK. The hotel is sat on the top of a tower block starting at the 15th floor. When you arrive at the foot of the tower it is not straight forward on how you actually get to the hotel, we managed to find out by asking a gentleman, who had a similar experience. The room itself was very spacious but at the same time very average. We had problems with reliable hot water in the bathroom, most of the time the water was warm but not hot. We had a fairly decent nights sleep, although in the early hours I am sure I could hear what sounded like a washing machine going, which was quite loud. Although being high up is a good thing as you get no traffic noise. Another thing worth mentioning is the tremendous view of the surrounding city, from your room this is a visually stunning experience. Main features in the hotel are the beautiful swimming pool on the 16th floor along with the impressive fitness center. Also the lobby area and dining is visually impressive, the bar in particular offering great views looked very good. As with most Holiday Inn's the price to eat in their diner is a joke, you are looking at 30 dollars minimum or so per person for a standard meal which you can get down the road for half the price. Overall: If you want an OK hotel in a good Chicago location then this may be a good move, however for the $180 a night rate I am sure if you looked around you could do better.

Positives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I booked through Priceline, and I had heard ahead of time that this particular hotel was unfriendly to Priceline customers. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my experience at all. The check-in clerk was very friendly and competent, asked about my room preferences (bed size and smoking/non), and gave me an excellent room that met my preferences. At check-out I had the same very helpful clerk, who seemed genuinely interested in how my stay was. There were no problems whatsoever with the bill. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I loved the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c huge (king-size bed, full-size couch, and lots of floor space to spare), and a nice view west over the Chicago River and Chicago landmarks to the west (United Center, Ogilvie station, etc). Since the rooms begin above the 15th floor, you get a nice overlook. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for a room with a view so I was thrilled to have been given one. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The room was kept very clean. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The water pressure and temperature in the shower were both fine. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The rate I got through Priceline was extremely reasonable ($65/night). \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Merchandise Mart el stop (Brown Line), food court, and shops are convenient. The exit from the el stop is directly into Merchandise Mart; this exit was always open during my visit and always staffed with a CTA staff member. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The hotel was very quiet. I heard no street noise or noise from other guests. I did hear noise from the Ogilvie train station just to the southwest of the hotel, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find train noise irritating, and I enjoyed watching the trains pull in and out of the station. Negatives/other factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This hotel is not especially close to the Mag Mile or the Loop, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly within walking distance for healthy adults. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really close enough to just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pop in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the day and drop off bags, etc. If you want to be within a block or two of Michigan Avenue or other downtown attractions, you may wish to choose another hotel. There are several good River North restaurants close to the hotel, however. (I would recommend researching nearby restaurants in advance.) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The hotel has a pedway that connects the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building with the Merchandise Mart, and when this pedway is open, you can walk directly from the hotel to the Merchandise Mart el stop without having to go outside, which was great during the early dark cold winter nights. (You also thus avoid the dark and deserted area under the Wells Street part of the el.) However, the pedway is not always open; the Sunday I stayed at the hotel, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open at all, and the weather was brutal that day. When the pedway isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open, neither are the Wells and Orleans street exits from the mart, and you need to take the stairs or elevator down one floor, exit the mart at its south entrance (about halfway between Wells and Orleans streets), and walk outside to the hotel from there (about 3/4 block total). This pedway was, however, open late on Saturday night and also late on Christmas Eve. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The hotel entrance is not necessarily that obvious (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the south side of the building). You can use Google Maps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 street view to get a look at it ahead of time, which is helpful. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you want any el other than the Brown Line, you have to transfer either downtown or further north at Fullerton. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This hotel (in my room at least) is still using the blanket/bedspread system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I much prefer the duvet system. The bed was adequate but not as comfortable as those in, say, Hiltons or Westins. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The two lamps by the bed were not as bright as I would have liked. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c You have to transfer elevators to get to your room. One elevator takes you from ground level to the lobby on the 15th floor, and a second set of elevators goes to floors 15 and above. My room was on 17 so I usually took the stairs (well lit and unlocked on all levels). \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the hotel at all so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that. In summary, for the price I paid via Priceline, I was more than satisfied with this hotel. All in all, I prefer the convenience of the many hotels in the Loop and nearer the Mag Mile, but this hotel was still within a reasonable distance, and the convenience of the el stop and the pedway (when open) made it more amenable to getting around than I had expected.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem, Israel", "Title": "\u201cReasonable Choice\u201d", "Author": "ezpass", "ReviewID": "UR11572482", "Content": "Nice downtown hotel.

Staff and concierge were very corteous and knowledgeable. Room and bathroom were clean and of average size. However, it felt like the rooms need to be freshened up, maybe new decor and carpeting would do. Mattress was hard. Hotel has a nice size pool and an excercise room. Haven't tried their restaurant but the prices were on the high end. One word of advise if you are driving. The direction says to turn on N.Orleans street but you actually need to turn on Franklin street which becomes N.Orleans. Not knowing this, I kept driving a bit around the hotel and wasn't able to find an entrance. I had to call the front desk from my cell phone to get directions. Overall, if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Chicago where you won't need to drive and look for parking spot, Holiday Inn is a good bet. We paid $100 per night booking on Hotwire.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat View\u201d", "Author": "TJCCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR8538199", "Content": "We stayed Aug. 16-Aug. 19.

The wireless was unavailable to several of our group members. They offered a \"box\" that picked up the wireless signal and connected like a LAN. Still nothing. Their help line suggested I turn off my virus software. Our company does not allow that and it does not impede my ability to use wireless networks at any other hotel.

We booked through Priceline about a week prior and were ok with the $147 per night rate. With Chicago's steep tax rate, we ended up paying $166 per night. Not cheap, but at least it we didn't pay full price. We were originally booked at the Club Quarters but decided we might need more space since we travel with a toddler. Both hotels cost the same and, in the end, we traded location for square footage. The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is located on the northern bank of the river, just before it splits. Although downtown Chicago is very walkable, it seemed most sights and restaurants were right near Michigan and Wacker. So, any sightseeing trip started with either a 15-20 minute walk or a $6 cab ride. If we were to visit Chicago again, we'd probably give the Club Quarters a try. The hotel is housed in the upper 8 floors of the Chicago Sun-Times building and is connected to the Merchandise Mart via a walkway. Although the website and the hotel's tv channel claim that all rooms have a view of the river, they do not. We had a view of the indoor pool. The special Priceline rate did not include breakfast. The hotel staff was always helpful and informative. We arrived at the hotel at 1 p.m. and a gentleman by the name of Angel was nice enough to check us in then instead of 3pm. He also recommended some sites. In the evening, when our toddler wanted milk but all stores were closed, the restaurant staff generously poured us a glass of milk to take to our room at no charge. When you travel with a two-year old, small details like these make all the difference. Just FYI: stores in Chicago close early. The room was clean, although, it needed some updating. Most notably, the hotel has not switched to duvets. They are still using bedspreads which are, well, usually very dirty as they are not changed after each guest. The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is about a 10 minute walk from the Brown El Line (through the Merchandise Mart) which will take you into the Loop and all other El connections. Wrigley Field and the University of Chicago were each about a 25 minute ride on the El (Wrigley is north and the U of C is south). Nothing else is in very close proximity to the hotel. Everything is about a 20-30 minute walk. Bottom line: The price was good but the location was not great.

Upon arrival we were told we would be staying in one of the Hotel rooms, not the condo promised and not with a King size bed as promised. Also not with a jacuzzi tub or fireplace or kitchen as advertised and promised. We were offered a room with 2 queen size beds not King. After some complaining on our part, we were given a King room without a bathtub. No kitchen,just a small refrigerator, no desk or even night stand on the right side of the bed so my wife had to use a chair to hold her sleep machine. The air conditioner made so much noise we could not use it. The small shower needed the shower head replaced. The room number for anyone interested was 112. Now when we went for the tour and voiced our complaints, we were asked to write it down. After doing so, we found out it wasn't good enough to send to corporate, we needed to write it as if we were lied to and not as angry customers. Fact is we were and still are angry because we were lied to as it was a classic bait and switch. We did not get the promised accommodations . Worse the room we were given was dingy and just dirty looking. There was not even any pictures on the walls and strangely the bed did not have a headboard.

Concierge Veronica helped us map out our routes to get to and from our destinations easily. She had some great suggestions on restaurants too.

When I was making the arrangements, my kids specified a place with an indoor water park. My Google search turned up the Welk Resort. I was familiar with the resort, but had never stayed there. I got what I thought was a great deal price wise and made our reservations. I was initially pleased with the front desk staff and found our room clean and everything in working order. The beds were comfy and we had plenty of room. My kids, 17 and 10, LOVED the water park! My husband and I LOVED the hot tub! I liked that it was open late so that we could use it after getting back from dinner and shows. They also used the game room and liked it as well. The short drive into Branson wasn't bad and I enjoyed being away from the \"Strip\" and the traffic. In return for attending a sales presentation on the time shares offered, we were able to get SDC tickets for $30 each! I was thrilled by this as it saved me over $100. The presentation lasted a little longer than we had been told, but it ended up not being an issue. We did not purchase a vacation package and this visably disappointed our sales rep. He was never rude, but once we said no, his demeanor changed and the friendly, personalble guy he had been, was ready for us to leave. This did not spoil my opinion of the resort and we will likely stay there again. I would recommend this for families and we look forward to coming back in the summer months so we can take full advantage of the pool area and other outdoor activities offered!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Friendship, TN", "Title": "\u201cSpring Break stay at Welk Resort in Branson, MO\u201d", "Author": "DinahFFriendship_TN", "ReviewID": "UR126385936", "Content": "For the second of two spring breaks in a row, we have just returned from the Welk Resort in Branson, MO.

We arrived on Friday, 6/24/11 and by Sunday I was already changing rooms for the second time. The first time was not the hotel's fault. There were three rooms jam packed with loud and obnoxious people/kids slamming doors and having a party in the hallway. At midnight I called the front desk when their kids were running wild up and down the halls, screaming and slamming doors, and they quickly worked to resolve the problem. If anyone is reading this, I understand you are on vacation, but HAVE SOME COMMON COURTESY FOR OTHER GUESTS LATE AT NIGHT! The rudeness of some people completely amazes me. That being said, the hotel's walls are paper thin. The carpet/padding NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. It is too old and outdated. This means if you are not on the 4th floor, it will sound like a stampede of elephants running over your head. The second room we were put in on the first floor had an infestation of flies. There were nearly 20 by the time we changed rooms again, after maintenance had killed a bunch and after we killed the first batch. By Sunday I had now unpacked a third time. I will say that the hotel staff was completely awesome in helping us. I cannot say enough about how polite and friendly they were; I never once had a problem with anyone I dealt with and had very pleasant encounters with them all. My children, who are 7 and 8, enjoyed the pool and water slide. Unless I was guaranteed a room on the 4th floor I don't think I could return and/or recommend this hotel. Also, half of the pillows are beyond lumpy - the other pillows were new. And when I say lumpy, I am talking lumpy, like they were run through a washing machine instead of being replaced. In fact, it's like they only replaced half of the pillows in the hotel, and having been in 3 different rooms in 3 days, I can attest to this. The buffet at the restaurant in the mornings was full of choices and the food was a great way to start the day. We ate at the restaurant for a couple of lunches and one dinner. It was very good. This hotel has great potential if they replace the remaining lumpy pillows and replace the carpet and padding to alleviate the obvious noise problem. It's also important to note that I traveled for over 5 years continuously so I am no stranger to \"normal hotel noises\" and do not need absolute silence to sleep, but this is above and beyond what you would expect as far as noise levels. All in all, my kids enjoyed it and would return in a heartbeat. I'm about 50/50 on whether I would return.

We booked a package deal and breakfast was included and was delicious every morning! This was refreshing since we woke up every morning exhausted even after sleeping all night. The beds were so uncomfortable that we tossed and turned all night. The only other negative was that the concierges were less than the best. They were not on time to help people any of the day's that we were there and could not give us much info about area attractions other than what was printed in the info materials that we could clearly read ourselves. While they could book anything we wanted, they were little help other than constantly trying to push us into viewing the timeshares. Overall we had a lot of fun and would return.

Not sure what was going on with the hot tub, people were getting out with foam all over them, as though they'd been in a bubble bath. I asked my daughter if she enjoyed the pool she said \"no, I'd have rather been at the Grand Oaks, at least there I have room to actually swim.\" One evening I made her get out of the pool because a child was standing on the edge, coughing up nastiness, and spitting it into the pool and watching it drift to the bottom. It was one of the most disgusting things I had ever seen. I was absolutely shocked. We had no internet for two and a half days. When we'd call the front desk we were told they didn't know why there was no internet. Checked in on Wednesday and finally had internet about 7 p.m. on Friday. We had three laptops and two Ipods with no connection.

( a little over 3 hours away) I am way too familiar of the cons of Branson as my family has stayed on the strip and stayed in a local community of Rockaway Beach. I booked the Welk Resort through a Reserve Direct while purchasing a Silver Dollar City package for my family. I did this because the location is awesome. NO it is not on the \"the strip\" but it is so convenient to get to either the East or West side of Hwy 76 from this location. You don't get the noise like you do when you stay on the strip. I will take the scenic route of 10 minutes to avoid the 1 hour plus drive it takes to navigate up and down Hwy 76. After I booked I read several reviews on Trip Advisor and based on some negative reviews went with little expectations. So glad I went ahead and kept my booking. We were in town earlier than anticipated and was allowed to check in early. Very accomodating. Young lady at front desk was polite and helpful. Ask about being on the 1st Floor but was advised up front that we were on the 4th floor and would be more than happy to change that however 1st and 2nd floor were being renovated and noise may be a factor. I kept the 4th floor rooms as they were already renovated. I've read alot of reviews referring to \"paper thin\" walls. Honestly I couldn't hear anything going on outside my door with the exception of some children at ONE point who were excited about swimming and that was when I was close to the door. I don't blame hotel just excited children that may have gotten louder than usual. Rooms were not overly decorated with gaudy pictures and ridiculous bedspreads. In fact I have been on several cruises and the linens and bedding were exceptional quality and comparible. We had 2 rooms and guess what they were the same in both rooms. Rooms were cleaned daily. Fresh supply of towels and wash clothes. Mattresses were firm to my liking but not my husbands. Once again a matter of opinion. I do agree not queen size beds but then I didn't measure either. Wi fi worked instantly with no problem. Mini golf course was free along with game room with air hockey, pool table and foosball. NO quarters required. With children 12 and 7 years of age that is a blessing. No the mini golf isn't the 36 hole course that you pay an arm and a leg for on the strip but hey it suits its purpose and my sons took advantage of it not once but twice. Splash a torium! My sons loved it. No it's not Whitewater thank god! Kids loved the slide and they have been to several water parks and said it's the fastest they've been on. What a nice change from the game boys, Wii and playstations! If you go with out children there is also a nice pool on the other side of hotel that is peaceful but you will love the Splash a torium as well. On site restaurant. We had the breakfast buffet. Service was friendly. Buffet was quick and just that a breakfast buffet. Food was hot and fruit was FRESH. No extra charges for juices, teas or coffees. Go somewhere else and see if they don't add an additional $1.95 for your drinks. Not here. Sure wish we had tried the room service or dinner in the restaurant but never really had the chance. My husband visited the lounge a couple times during happy hour. $3 Margaritas were great and good sized and they didn't slight you on the alcohol either. Restaurant and Lounge do close at 8 pm. If you want a snack plenty of vending machines available and if you can't find what you want.. there is a Shell station maybe 1/4 north of resort that has a little of everything.

Very clean hotel, nice staff. Some updates would make the rooms nicer, but I would definitely come back. I was a little worried because of the Splashatorium, since I didn't have any kids, that I would feel out of place. Well, the Splashatorium is a seperate building from the hotel, so it seemed as if everyone was over there swimming, so the pool located right outside of the hotel was more for people without kids and it was pretty relaxing! The hotel isn't in the middle of town, so if you are wanting to just walk from your hotel, this isn't the place to go. But it is very peaceful where it is located and definitely worth the drive. I'm sure you won't mind, especially since you can pick up speed when you get away from the grid locked streets in the middle of town! One downfall would be the rooms/floors seem thin, I kept hearing kids running at night time.

I know it was not isolated to my room since one night I tried sleeping in a chair in the lobby to escape the 30 year old beds and I was swarmed with flies in the lobby area on the 1st floor. I am guessing that the flies are a result of whatever horrible thing happened in room 112. When I asked about this room the only answer I got was \"all I know is that it is out of order\". That was an understatement. I peaked in the room (the door was not locked and was slightly cracked open), and saw a completely gutted room with wet towels, water and flies everywhere. The \"watery substance\" began oozing into the halls and by our last day there, you could smell mold. I would think that a cleaning crew or carpet dryers should have been in place to prevent this awful mess from getting worst, but there was no cleanup effort for the 5 nights that we were there. When a hotel says \"Free Wireless Internet\", one assumes this means in their room. I only saw the Welk SSID one time on my laptop from my room and the connection was too poor to connect. I am guessing I was not alone since every afternoon, every chair in the lobby was occupied with other guests and their laptops. The guest computer setup in the 1st floor lobby had a 1Ghz CPU and 512MB of memory and was so slow it was worthless. Upon checkout, I made the reception staff aware of these issues. Her response was \"Did you enjoy the Splash-a-Torium?\" My response was \"Yes, it was nice, however the main reason for staying at a hotel was to have a place to sleep each night and this was miserable.\" Her response was, \"We are remodeling and if you come back next year it will be better\". So, obviously, her efforts at an apology or to make it right fell very short. The only positive was the splash a torium.

It was a short distance from the strip though, so we didn't feel like we were in the middle of the action. Overall, the best part of the stay was the splashatorium and clubhouse amenities.

If we had not had the $30 coupon for dinner we would have been very disappointed when we received the bill - the price of 2 only avg buffets (no menu available) tea and a too thin marguerita was MORE than a wonderful meal at Olive Garden and the most fantastic marguerita the evening before.

The condo is beautiful and well equipped. The kitchen is fully equipped, and has a full size refrig/freezer. I'd recommend stopping at a grocery store for at LEAST your breakfast meals, so you don't have to go down to the hotel restaurant in the morning. I had asked for a room that is handicapped accessible. We were on the first floor. (It is two floors, and I didn't see an elevator) There was no handicapped parking with flat curbs by our building. There was at another one of the new buildings. Our lodge is part of a new timeshare resort that is still being built. Luckily, my husband is not 100% wheelchair bound. It would be difficult getting in and out of the bed, the toilet, and the bath tub, which is a jacuzzi (nice if not disabled) is tough to get in and out of without help. We stayed in the one bedroom, which is over 800 sq feet. VERY nice. The porch is private and has two adarondike type wooden rockers. It overlooks a pond. The new pool/water park is not open. This was disappointing. The hotel pool is about the size of a backyard pool, and is outside the main hotel. There is a 9 hole mini-golf course that is older and nothing special. It would be fun if you had small kids. There is no additional charge to use it. If you are diabled, you need to take a car down to the main hotel. The main hotel is shabby looking. The carpeting is dirty and older. It smells smokey/not pleasant. The gift shop is only open during the morning and when they have dinner shows. The restaurant looks like a cafeteria. The lounge smells smokey, even in the morning. The staff is very friendly and nice. Ramsey, the consierge was SUPER in helping us choose our shows, get our tickets, and help with handicapped patron issues. The resort is located a few miles from the main drag. This is not necessarily bad. In summary, if you stay here, stay in the condos..

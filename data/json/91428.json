The hotel was outdated, but it was very clean and reasonable for price paid during the event. If wanting to use a pool, you have to walk across the lot to the adjacent Comfort Inn, which is not ideal during the winter. The staff was very friendly, same lady working when check-in at around 4pm and check-out around 11am. Only complaint was the parking, with the hotel sharing a parking lot with the Comfort Inn. No spots were open in the general parking, so we parked in the park and fly area, even though we did not have a tag. GPS didnt find the correct exit number but that wasnt a problem since we know our way around Indianapolis somewhat, even though getting to hotel once off interstate is somewhat confusing.

I did, and I got a confirmation number. When we got to the motel around 5 pm on May 29, the front-desk person asked for my reservation/confirmation papers. She looked something up and told me there was a problem with the room and that we were being sent to Days Inn, \"about 5 miles away. \" I had chosen Sleep Inn because it was supposedly within walking distance of the track, about 2 miles away. It turned out that it was actually more like 3 miles. I asked why there was no room, when I had a made the reservation in January, and I was told \"I don't know.\" She also said that it wasn't her fault, she didn't do it, I shoudn't be taking it out on her. I told her I wasn't taking it out on her and asked for a manager, since she claimed it wasn't her fault. She said she didn't know who the manager was because the motel had been bought out a month ago. We asked for directions to Days Inn. She marked a spot on a map and said she \"thought\" it was there. (Turned out the location she marked was incorrect.) My husband got the correct directions to Days Inn from the computer in the lobby, but couldn't get a printout. The computer spat out a blank piece of paper across the room. By this time, the front-desk person presumably had called someone and found out that the reason we didn't have a room was that the air conditioning was not working. I asked her when that happened. She said 2 days ago. I asked why no one called me. She said she didn't know, they should have called, don't take it out on her, \"everyone\" is blaming her, etc. (Another guest was also complaining about his room.) I cannot comment on the rooms at Sleep Inn because I never saw a room. We ended up at Days Inn (same owner). Days Inn was 7 miles from the track. Not exactly the \"walking distance\" I had reserved 4 months earlier. We would be charged Sleep Inn's rate to stay at Days Inn. I found out after the fact that Days Inn's rates were actually lower, yet we were being charged the higher rate for a room we never had.

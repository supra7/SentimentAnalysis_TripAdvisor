I've tried several, higher category hotels in the area but this has become my preferred hotel. I used to live in the area and I also think this is a great location if you are visiting LA for a vacation. It is right in between Venice/Santa Monica and Beverly Hills/Hollywood. Plus, you can easily hop on the freeway to drive up to the Getty, Universal Studios or Disneyland. The rooms are very spacious and some have lofts with a spiral staircase leading up to an upper level with a queen bed and TV. I always request a room that is not directly under a loft room because it can get noisy when people are running up and down those stairs. I love that the rooms all have microwaves and refrigerators. There is a grocery store across the street so you can stock up on snacks and drinks. Plus, there is a great mall nearby where you can see a movie or get some delicious food. The free breakfast is exactly the same as every other Holiday Inn Express but I happen to think it is more than adequate and usually throw my diet aside for the cinnamon rolls. I do have to say that I have stayed at many Holiday Inn Express hotels over the years and this is the nicest one I've encountered. The staff is very friendly and helpful and I always enjoy my stay. Plus, I think that their rewards program is one of the best in the business. If you aren't a Priority Club member, make sure you join before your stay.

We stayed in a suite which had 2 queen beds, 1 upstairs in a loft area and one on the main level. It gave us a bit of privacy from the kids, however we didn't realise at the time of booking that the only bathroom is on the main level, so it meant that the kids had to go up and down a metal spiral staircase to go to the bathroom. Of course the kids thought it was excellent, but the novelty wore off for Mum and Dad pretty quickly. The suite was comfortably furnished and very roomy, which was a plus. We looked onto the rear of the hotel rather than the main road (on request) and found it very quiet for sleeping, which was especially appreciated after a long flight.

So that being said, here we go: Check In/Front Desk: First, locating the hotel is difficult. There are no signs. It is right by a huge sign for the Courtyard by Marriot. So when you see that sign, you know you are in the right place. There is a $15 valet service. The valet guy was incredibly nice and I felt very secure with leaving my vehicle over night there. The front desk person, Troy, seemed very cold at first. He did not welcome me as a priority club member and I did not receive a gift at check in, which at other Holiday Inn Expresses seemed to be the norm. I later inquired about a fitness center and he offered a pass to a gym which was incredibly convenient! He was very helpful and cheery after my initial check in, which was good. There was also another person at the front desk when I checked in. I didn't get a name, but she was incredibly personable and even struck up a little conversation with me, which was welcoming and seemed like natural conversation, where as with other hotel front desk staff, it seems that they ask questions because they have to. The Room: There was a lot of noise from W. Olympic Blvd. in my room. Also I could hear every step being taken in the hallway outside and in the room above mine. I can generally sleep through the noise, but this was a little excessive. The room was clean, except the bath tub looks like it needs a good bleaching. Also, there was a small stain on one of my bed's comforters. One thing about the \"Two Queen Non-Smoking\" beds is that they are small. I sleep on a Queen bed at home, and these were definitely smaller, almost the size of a double bed. The beds are very very comfortable and the room was incredibly spacious. There was a microwave, mini-fridge, flat screen TV, iron and ironing board, small desk and chair. Location: Like I said, incredibly difficult to find. It is in a good area though. There is a grocery store nearby and a great mall with plenty of fine dining opportunities with in walking distance (about 5 blocks) Overall: I liked this hotel's staff and the room wasn't bad.

Both had a ridiculous amount of room-- a full sitting area on the first level, which made it very easy to have meetings. (Of course, I as a parent, I was thinking it would be awesome with kids, plenty of room to move, and separate sleeping area-- not something you get in a trad room.)

I called the hotel, spoke to the front desk which were rude to begin with. I asked to speak with the manager, they transfered me to a general staff answering machine, instead of telling me he's not in his office. It took forever for me to get a hold of the manager as he \"had no direct line\" to get a hold of ...leaving messages, and finally I insisted on calling back until I got a hold of him directly. He was very rude and wouldn't even listen to anything I had to say before he assumed it was my fault in the cancellation, saying he does not have a cancellation number on file. He also said that the booking was checking in for 2 nights, then checking back in on the check out date for another 2 nights. Doesn't that seem a bit fishy to you when I only made one reservation? And why would I do that in the first place?! I even got my manager who has been in the travel industry for many years to talk to him. He still denied it, saying it was our fault and would only drop one of the charges out of \"good will\".

It was okay, a mixture of plus and minus points. I was upgraded to a two-level \"suite\" because the hotel was full, which was nice, but did involve going up and down stairs between the bedroom area and the bathroom. The room overlooked the street, and was pretty noisy, as was the air conditioning / heating system. This last was controlled within the room, and was quick and accurate, though. The hotel is opposite a grocery store, which was convenient, but I didn't feel safe walking alone between nearby locations at night so had to take cabs. (A friend of mine was not bothered by this.) There was a complimentary breakfast which was very pleasant and extensive for this kind of hotel - it included hot oatmeal, bagels, toast, cinnamon rolls, a variety of cereals, juices, fruit and coffee. Service was unpredictable: the first day I got a very friendly welcome and extra blankets arrived at my room within minutes. The second night however I was treated extremely rudely by another employee who refused to provide government tax forms (which were then supplied easily by another employee the next morning).

Obviously, you don't expect much from Holiday Inn. They offer basic accommodation at a low price, and usually do so reasonably competently, as long as you're not staying for too long. I only chose Holiday Inn because I was only going to be in LA for one night, and because my priority was to be as close as possible to a specific Century City address, as I am unfamiliar with the city. But this place really failed to live up to Holiday Inn's usual standards. Whether you consider their usual standards to be adequate or not is besides the point - even a true Holiday Inn devotee would struggle to find this sty acceptable. Everything in the building (carpets, furniture, appliances, decor) was at least 30 years old, or had been horribly mistreated in order to give that impression. Nothing was particularly clean and it was all depressingly drab. Front desk staff were genuinely struggling to understand me (whether it was the English language or simply my English accent that caused the problem, I don't know, but if I were foolish enough ever to return, I would come armed with a Spanish phrasebook) and they also managed to lose the suitcase that I left in reception (although it did eventually turn up). The food and furniture that I found in the squalid breakfast room depressed me beyond belief. I have given 2 stars rather than one to take into account the low price and my already low expectations, and to reflect my grudging admission that it propbably could have been worse (at least the TV worked and the water was hot).", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAvoid at all cost!\u201d", "Author": "icenet", "ReviewID": "UR5611848", "Content": "I had my parents in town over the weekend.

Now you can't turn around either because there is no room. The room had a leak from the bathroom above so my parents had to move after they had already unpacked.

Valet indoor parking right outside the lobby door. As stated in other reviews, this hotel is very small, but the room was quite comfortable for 2 people.

I do think the rooms need some updating with the wallpaper & tile in bathrooms other than that it was comfortable & quiet. I noticed the light out at the entry and a slight smell from the sink drain and informed Melanie at the desk and it was taken care of while we were out for the day.I was concerned when I didn't see a coffee machine so I called the desk and they let me know it was stored on the top shelf in the closet and sure enough it was there. I bid on this hotel on Priceline and won it for under $100, picking San Diego Coastal and while La Jolla is coastal, this hotel is about 10 miles from any water.It is conveniently right off the I-5. The hotel is a short drive to the Westgate UTC mall, we ate breakfast at the Cocos across the street. The night we arrived at the hotel we went to Melting Pot to eat which is right across the driveway from the hotel along with a sushi and steak place. For a family of 4 the bill was $89 and only one of us had wine, a little too pricey for me. The room we were given was on the 11th floor and a view of the well heated pool. This pool is shared with a nice gym in the complex but it was never too crowded and plenty of towels on hand and nice cabanas that most hotels require you to reserve & pay for but not this Hyatt. The pool is set up so people from the hotel can swim & not interfere with lap swimmers from the gym. The hot tub was just luke warm on the second night and a call to the desk had maintenance out there in less than 15 minutes to fix it. They offer you the option to use the big fancy gym for $13 a day but the hotel has it's own smaller gym that is free. I could pick up the Wifi by the pool that is offered free from their lounge-Michael's. I would stay here again but only if I was able to snag it for under $100, there is a parking fee $20 or $25 for valet. Since I got a good deal on the hotel I didn't mind the fee. There is parking on the street but this hotel is surrounded by office complexes and it seemed to me most of the street parking was taken. I was very happy with the Valet & the Bell person, both offered great service.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice place, with small complaints\u201d", "Author": "teheteha", "ReviewID": "UR126861488", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights with a group rate for a wedding. Actually spent quite a bit of time at the hotel because wedding events were on site in the downstairs ballroom both nights. We arrived around 12:30 p.m. and a non-smoking two-queen-bed room wasn't ready yet (not complaining, just stating) so we checked our bags with the bellhop and drove to downtown La Jolla. The front desk staff weren't that friendly at check-in (nor during the rest of the visit, they were OK, but nothing special), though the bell service staff was more friendly. They called when our room was ready, which was nice. Our room was on the third floor with a view of the front of the hotel and restaurants across the driveway. Not that exciting, but kind of fun to watch all the comings-and-goings. When we got off the elevator, it smelled like cigarette smoke, which continued as we walked down the hall. Inside our room though was fine. Just annoying to have to walk through the scent every time we made a trip from the elevator. Room was clean and nice, with small windows you could actually open for some fresh air. Bathroom was fine as well, with usual amenities plus toothpaste. Our room was never made up though by housekeeping on the next day of our two-night stay, which seemed very odd. We were gone for about five hours total during daytime hours, and were surprised to find it as we left it. We finally got a knock on the door around 5:30 p.m. asking if we'd like housekeeping to make up the room -- at least they finally came, but at that point we were in the middle of getting ready for the wedding that night so declined the service. I feel like 5:30 p.m. is pretty late for housekeeping, even if the hotel is busy (we saw carts on our floor earlier in the day, so not sure why we were overlooked). We didn't get any knocks on the door earlier in the day and didn't have a \"do not disturb\" sign out or anything. We did track someone down later for extra towels and bathroom amenities. Spent some time in the Michael's bar both days between sightseeing and evening events. It's a little pricey, but typical of hotels, so to be expected. Staff was friendly enough, good seating options indoors and outdoors (though some weird stains on the chairs) and a decent atmosphere, too. Also, the ballroom was a nice space for the wedding and smaller pre-wedding ceremony. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby, which is handy for a quick coffee or breakfast snack. Parking here isn't the greatest, but it works. It's $20 for self-park, $25 for valet. We did self-park. We got a $10 coupon for parking at the on-site ceremony, but were informed at the front desk it's only for local people (so locals get a discount, but not guests of the hotel spending a few hundred dollars?). The parking garage is mostly underground, and fairly dark -- could use some more lighting. It felt safe, but just dark. Also, you have to take separate elevator or stairs from inside the hotel, so it's two separate rides down (with a walk outside in between) to get from the garage to the hotel. The location is fine in that it's right by I-5 so easy freeway access, but it's not really walking distance to anything. We stayed here because the wedding was here, but otherwise would rather be walking distance to downtown La Jolla. Overall, this is a fine place to stay, quite nice in a lot of ways -- I just found a lot to nitpick. However, still worthy of a stay if you want to be close to the UCSD campus or otherwise like the location.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada, United States", "Title": "\u201cThis place is NOT worth the $$$\u201d", "Author": "Allison S", "ReviewID": "UR126806064", "Content": "I traveled to La Jolla to attend an appointment with my father at Moores Cancer Center.

My reason for choosing this hotel is primarily one of convenience. I was visiting family in the \"Golden Triangle\" and the hotel is just 3 blocks away. Overall, the hotel is clean and modern. It's public areas are clean and well maintained. The reception staff is pleasant and accommodating. The small fitness centre well ventilated and reasonably well equipped at far as hotel gym's go. For those looking for a more elaborate fitness facility or spa, there is one next door for an additional fee. Patrons of the Hyatt have free use of the large heated outdoor pool. The dining room Barcino's serves up a great breakfast with all the basics of a cold and hot buffet. On the recent stay over the Thanksgiving weekend, I was fortunate to take advantage of the \"Bed and Breakfast\" deal which included breakfast for two including taxes and gratuities as well as valet parking. As mentioned by another reviewer, the parking at the hotel is quite steep although there is parking a block away along Nobel Drive. If there is any area for improvement, I would suggest more frequent dusting of the air vents and steam cleaning of the carpets in some of the rooms. I did not request a \"hypo-allergenic\" room on either one of my three stays but did not have trouble until the last one.

We easily found street parking every day and multiple times a day since we left for all meals. The restaurants surrounding the hotel are very close, but also pricey- so we drove to the surrounding area for breakfast/lunch/dinner. The room we received was updated, very modern and very clean and nice. It had 2 Queen sized beds, plenty of pillows and a big screen TV. Although we didn't eat any meals there, we did go to the bar, Michael's- service there was great- and they even have gas firepits outside and you can watch TV outside (football games, etc) while enjoying your drinks. It is a sports bar theme, and they give you a \"sound box\" for your table, so you can hear whatever game you are watching- I thought that was a great idea! We used the pool every day we were there, and it was warm but not obnoxiously warm- just comfortable to dip in, even though the weather was only in the 70s. Nice hot tub too- we used that as well. There are fire pits outside by the pool which are on every night- I saw a sign on the front desk saying they do s'mores out there at 8pm every night, but the night we went no one came out with them. We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay here again if we return to the area. In terms of internet/wireless- there is free wireless access which I used in Michael's (bar/lounge)- and also 2 business \"pods\" located in a hallway on your way out to the pool area where you can use the internet for free for 15 minutes (self timed/honor system)- that was a huge plus. My husband was disappointed that you can't use the gym for free- you have to pay. I'd say that was the only down-side to this hotel.

But the most annoying part was the inability to find an electrical outlet in the room. There was one outlet, which became my hub for my laptop, phone, and ironing in the morning. No plugs near the bed. The hotel layout is confusing, so much so that the ladies in front of me had to get an escort to their car in the parking deck. The surrounding restaurants are all decent but also very pricey. No such thing as cheap eats here! It again reinforces my professional and personal feeling that staying at expensive hotels are not worth the cost. This certainly was not.

Overall, we had mixed reviews about this hotel, so I'm not sure I would consider going back. NEGATIVES: --SELF-PARKING IS $20!!! Valet is $25!!! Outrageous. We tried to find street parking at night, but since everyone else was trying to avoid paying this exorbitant fee, street parking was full. We were informed that the parking garage is NOT the property of Hyatt, hence they were unable to waive the fee or adjust it in any way. This is unacceptable. How could a hotel NOT have its own parking? And there was no mention of this fee on their website when booking, which makes it all the more annoying. This is pure bait-and switch. Thankfully, we only stayed one night. I read another reviewer who mentioned that a 5-night stay could add $100 to your bill! --GOT A SMOKING ROOM WHEN WE REQUESTED NON-SMOKING. Sound like other reviewers had similar problems. --BATHROOM NEEDS UPDATING. The shower fixtures in our room looked like they were about to fall off! Tiles looked dated. --NO SOUNDPROOFING. I agree with other reviewers that the walls have no sound proofing. Every noise from next door (bath and shower, running water) could be easily heard. --HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES? When we checked in to drop off our bags, there were used glasses outside our door, and noticed that several other rooms had dirty dishes in the hallway, waiting to be picked up. When we came back in the evening, the dirty glasses were still there! --NO MINIBAR OR COFFEE MAKER IN ROOM. So don't be afraid to ask for coffee vouchers at check-in. POSITIVES: --PLEASANT CHECK-IN. Staff member Pedro was friendly and pleasant to deal with. He was very helpful and offered coffee vouchers, maps to the city, local recommendations, etc. One other reviewer mentioned him by name--Hyatt management would do well to commend him for doing his job well. You would be surprised how other 4- or 5-star hotels mess up the check-in experience. --GOOD DINING OPTIONS. At least four fine-dining restaurants are located across the street. -- QUICK RESPONSE TO ROOM CONCERNS. With the issues about the room mentioned above, I called the Front Desk to see if it was possible to be switched to a different room. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked, but they immediately offered a price adjustment. Also, within 10 minutes of calling, someone from housekeeping was there to \"freshen up\" the room (as usual, all they can really do is spray the room with a neutralizing freshener to cover up the smoke smell) and pick up the dirty glasses. And also within 10 minutes, someone from engineering was there to check in on the bathroom fixtures. While they weren't really able to do much, it was at least nice to see that they responded quickly and made you feel that they weren't just ignoring your concerns.

The room was clean but the tub had chips and the sink too. You could see some mold in the corner of the shower and the floor tiles or something dark.

They have a decent workout room and you can use it free of charge with your stay. Don't confuse it with the spa and fitness center.

It was Comic-Con weekend, so the city was full. Yet, I put in a bid on priceline and got the Hyatt. The hotel was designed by Michael Graves and it is quite beautiful. Check-in late on Thursday night was a breeze. We then ran to \"Michaels\" for some food as it closes at midnight, our waitress took our orders quickly so we could eat and we had excellent hamburgers. The beds and linens are very comfortable and the a/c was very, very cold, which was nice. The rooms are quite large and we had a nice view from the 11th floor. You might want to take ear-plugs -- not because the hotel is rowdy, but you can hear just about everything from other rooms around you, above, below, to the side. If you're a light sleeper, this could be an issue. Had room service for breakfast and it was merely ok. There is a Spa / Gym facility on premises which said that you could purchase \"day passes.\" I thought I was going to have to pay for my daily work out. However, there is a small, but very nice gym off the lobby (Stay Fit) that even has an outdoor work out area all of which is no charge at all, and it has excellent equipment. Great snack shop off the lobby as well that has just about everything you would need, including fresh sandwiches, coffee, beer, wine, water, etc. The pool is beautiful and very large, with swimming lanes for laps. Presumably b/c of Comic-con and the city being so full, this hotel which is more of a business hotel among office buildings was full of kids this weekend. There is no refrigerator or mini-bar in the rooms, but there is an ice machine by the elevators to keep diet Cokes cold (beware, it's a Pepsi property). Parking is expensive at $20/day, but there was street parking if you could find an empty spot. Internet is $10/day. There is a laptop sized safe, which is always appreciated. All staff members were very pleasant and greeted us whenever we were out and about.

We were in San Diego for a week looking at houses to buy as we're moving to the area in August after our vacation. We were in an amazing ocean view rental house in Cardiff by the Sea but we extended our stay 2 nights before going to Hawaii to do some 2nd showings on some houses we found and liked. The house wasn't available so I had to book a hotel. I ended up booking right off of their website and I was surprised how affordable this hotel was. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much but we were immediately impressed as it's a really great property. The lobby was spacious and beautiful. The check in was very efficient and Pedro, the guy at the front desk was extremely friendly and polite. We booked with our AAA card and to our surprise, they included breakfast for two people for each night we stayed. And we are Gold Passport members and they included certificates for coffee each morning at the Starbucks next door (well it's not a real Starbucks but they had coffee there from Starbucks). The staff was always friendly throughout our stay and everyone had smiles on their faces which is always nice to see. The breakfast buffet included was quite good with a wide variety of items including eggs, bacon, sausages, Eggs Benedict, Omelets, cereal, fresh fruit, Oatmeal and other things. They didn't charge for our 2 kids either. The servers couldn't be more friendly. The room itself was very nice and extremely clean. We got a 7th floor room facing the pool/spa. It was very quiet. It had this huge 55 inch LCD TV, a work desk was spacious. The downside is there was no fridge at all in the room. They did have a nice large El Safe electronic safe. (I use the same ones in my rental properties I own). You can fit a laptop in it. The bathroom as well was very spacious with bathtub and shower. The maids did a great job cleaning each day. They had two internet plans. One for $10 a day and another for I think $15/day that said it was faster. The $10 a day was limited to 256kb speed it said. I just tethered my Blackberry to my Macbook Pro for internet so avoided charges. We went down to the pool/spa one day and it was quite nice. The pool is heated so you can use it even if it's not sunny out or into the evening. The pool is good sized with 3 swim lanes for laps and a large jacuzzi tub next door that felt good after a long day. The hotel is very kid friendly and was so nice with our 2 kids. The only downside is that their valet/parking fee is a bit high. They charge $25 a day for valet parking. It's $20 a day if you self park so it doesn't really make sense to self-park in my opinion. With the valet parking, you can just call down and they have the car waiting for you. Very friendly guys and I tipped them each time I got my car...so valet can add up. There are plenty of restaurants in front of the hotel including Trulucks Steakhouse, a fondo place and some other options. Plus Westfield Mall is just a few blocks up. All in all it was a bargain for the quality it was considering the included breakfast buffet. Anyone that isn't an AAA member should join as it's well worth it with various hotels. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the area, especially those with young children. PS - another thing to notice is it seems they have low rates but partially subsidize that with high rates for room service. They charged $4 delivery fee plus 22% tip automatically. 22% seems excessive to me and higher than most hotels I've been to. So a $15 hamburger turns into about $23 after taxes so keep that in mind on that.

I pulled up to the front of the hotel and asked if I could just unload my luggage, and that I was hoping to get a spot to park on the street. They obliged and helped me with my luggage. Then the bellhop Tony came to assist with getting the bags to our room. He was AMAZING! So helpful with information and making you feel relaxed and comfortable. The hotel wasn't busy, so he even arranged for a late check out for us, and gave me a map of the area including where to eat and how to get to the best beaches. Fresh cookies and lemonade as we set out on our way to SeaWorld were a pleasant surprise. Doors were always opened for us, check in/out was a breeze, and the room was very quiet, spacious and comfortable. Having the adjoining room with the kids was great. We were on the twelfth floor. Not a really pretty view, but at least a little of the pool and the grounds. I do wish they had a mini fridge, but not a big deal on a short stay. When we went to check out, Tony again came up and helped us with our luggage, I didn't even have to tell him our room number or name. He's that good. I hope the hotel knows what a treasure of an employee they have. Even the doorman was very friendly and the valet gave me a rose on Mother's Day.

I took my family for a weekend trip to San Diego. I booked three rooms through Priceline for $90 a night. Upon arrival, we were hit with a $20 a night self park fee. The parking is not directly adjacent to the hotel. Depending on where you end up finding a parking stall, it can take you at least 15 minutes to get from your car to the parking elevator to grade level of the hotel. Once you get there, you have to walk through hotel grounds, pass the pool, through one of their business center lobbies and up one floor to the check-in lobby. With three small kids, just having to get to check-in and get luggage was a big task. Here is my assessment after spending one day and night at the hotel: 1. Cleanliness: The hotel rooms looked as if the sheets and linens are changed daily and shampoos restocked daily-ONLY. Aside from that, it is evident that they don't clearn the rooms. The carpet was worn, the windows were dirty and the remote and phone were sticky. The walls had scuffs, spills and stains on the paint and the wall coverings. The walls in the bathroom by the toilets had spill stains. The toilet seat had fecal matter smeared on the rim. The upholstered furniture all had stains. The decorative pillows on the bed also had stains and smelled dirty. The corridors had a strong chemical smell that endured the afternoon until the next morning. I had to constantly remind the kids not to touch anything and not to walk around without shoes on. That doesn't make for a relaxing time being afraid that you'd catch something from a dirty hotel. 2. Decor: The room decor was average. It had the standard dresser, desk with chair and two sitting chairs that were soiled. The bathroom looked like a residential bathroom with 4\"x4\" ceramic tiles on the walls and 2\"x2\" ceramic tiles on the floors. There was nothing spectacular about the room or bathroom. The corridors looked like a cheap Vegas hotel hallway-completed devoid of class and design. The rest of the public areas at the hotel was just plain average. 3. Pool: The pool was a fair size. They close part of it for 3 lanes of swimming and the rest for free swim. There is a tiny hot tub that fits about 5 adults comfortably. There is a bar to buy drinks. So if you are there with small kids, you need to remember that there are also tipsy adults in the pool. Another drawback is that to get to the pool and back, you have to go through a very public lobby through their convention area. It is not the easiest thing to keep three wet kids quiet while walking through areas where people were having business dinner and hosting an event. I felt bad having to shush the kids out of consideration. 4. Service: Service was average. Nothing spectacular about the front desk staff or anyone else we encountered at the hotel grounds. 5. Access: As previously mentioned, parking is not close, not in the least. So if you are traveling with 3 kids and luggage, be forwarned. The hotel itself is close to the freeway. That should also give you an indication that it is not near the beach or any scenic area, and it is noisy. There are four elevators that take you up and down but they are slow. 6. Comfort: The beds were all queen sized in all three rooms. The beds were bouncy. The bedding was average, rough with a strong chemical smell. The duvet was down, but very thin with feathers coming out. There was a large stain on one of the duvets. It's questionable when the last time the duvet blankets were washed. The size of the rooms were not large by American standards. 7. Overall Value: It was not worth $90 a room plus fees and taxes. In hindsight, a holiday in elsewhere would have been more worth the money than the Hyatt. By the way, internet access is $9.95 a day. Breakfast is also not included. The hotel room has a safe, but no under counter refrigerator. Water is $3/bottle. This hotel is an a-la-carte hotel. Anything you want may be avilable but you have to pay for it all.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few miles north of downtown San Diego, just off of I-5. Very convenient access to the freeway and everything in the region. Close to the airport and a short drive away from downtown San Diego.

I am unable to change between ESPN and The Discovery Channel without making this navigation process: Menu -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Channel Guide -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Down -> Select. ESPN is channel 18 and The Discovery Channel is 19. No, you cannot enter the channel number with the remote control or use the Up/Down buttons. The Ugly Wireless Internet access became standard 10 years ago. The Hyatt Regency charges $10/day for wifi. No, there is no other access point that you can connect to. Luckily I was on vacation for the purpose of unplugging from the world. Had this been a business trip I would either have to pay the bounty for Internet access or select a hotel that does not insist on nickel-and-diming its customers. I read about parking on several travel websites but did not let it prevent me from booking this hotel. Valet parking is $8/hour or $25/night. Self-parking in the garage beneath the hotel is $3/hour or $20/night. My wife and I were able to cope with the parking situation but it was a major inconvenience. We elected to save our money by parking on the streets around the hotel. This was only possible because my wife and I are athletic and she was able to take our bags to our room while I parked the car when we arrived. If you are traveling by yourself or if long walks (including several flights of stairs or major inclines) tire you, I suggest planning on using the self-parking in the garage. My shortest walk from my car to the hotel lobby was 200 yards and including crossing 6 lanes of traffic and 3 flights of stairs. My longest was a quarter mile, though it was traffic and stairs free. There are other businesses and apartments in the area that each has patrons that park along the streets, making finding a spot near the front of the hotel difficult.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cwhat a great weekend in La Jolla!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jlrb07", "ReviewID": "UR74049872", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency LaJolla for a long weekend to attend a wedding last week.

To us, it was definitely worth the upgrade fee for the access to continental breakfast, snacks, and drinks throughout most of the day.

The pool is heated which is a bonus. The parking (valet or self park garage) is expensive but there are many places along the street nearby where we were able to park at no charge. The hotel is not in the La Jolla cove area; it is about a 10 minute drive, but the drive is pleasant.

We booked it because of a medical conference I was attending. I read the reviews about the parking, and being an idiot, did not take them to heart. The parking in unbelievable. We could not find a parking spot on the street!! We spent expensive gas driving the 2 streets the hotel tells you about. We finally decided to park in the garage for $20 PER NIGHT. Valet parking is $25 per night, but you will have to tip! (they deserve it anyway) Upon entering the garage the sign attached to the wall said: THIS GARAGE CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. (THIS WARNING REQUIRED BY SECTION 25249.6 OF THE CA, HEALTH & SAFETY CODE) My husband is in very delicate medical condition, in fact, we have a handicapped parking license, but in this case it helped us none. I was not going into that garage and causing my husband any more medical maladies. Wow!!! What do they have in this garage??? We went to the front desk and asked a very pretty young lady what this was about. She claimed she had no knowledge of this. She promised to get back to our room with the info, but she did not. How can she not know about this??? This garage is attached to their hotel!! So again, we spent the rest of the week wasting time trying to park a car and getting a lot of exercise walking back to the hotel. NEVER EVER would we ever stay here again, just for this one reason. We checked in with a \"Paula Lanning.\" I had an option to upgrade for $29 per night, but she refused to allow it. Thank you Paula!! It would have been a waste of our money. It would not have given us a different room, I just like to have concierge access to get coffee and sodas. (No, this hotel, does not give complimentary liquor and we don't drink anyway, so we could care less about that.) So we saved over $180! My complimentary breakfast ticket went to my husband who needs to eat in the morning. No complimentary extra breakfast tickets at this hotel, like we have gotten at Radissons and Hiltons! Each one has my name on it and DATED, so I bet they don't allow you to use 2 the same day. Shame on the public for even trying this! How terrible that you would want to have breakfast one day together, huh? Then I guess if you don't use it the day it is dated for, you loose it?? Why so cheesy about a breakfast ticket??? Isn't this a little embarrassing for a Hyatt, to have someone sit down and write these out so specifically??? Come guys, have some class!! When you walk into this hotel and get up to your room, you get the feeling that this hotel is nice, but...............is very bare bones. I think they are cutting costs down to a very tight budget. No beautiful flower arrangements or complimentary apples, zippooooooo. The hotel seemed to be very dead to me, I asked one of the valets what the booking % was right now, and he said it wasn't very busy, so I don't understand why she refused to upgrade us, but it worked out the best for us anyway, and actually the hotel lost money. The room is very sparse, the furniture green, 60's-ish that had a few battle scares on them. We were suppose to have free internet in our room, but we do not carrry a laptop. My husband checked on the business floor and the internet would have been very expensive. The beds are fine, but what is up with some of these hotel linens?? Why when you open the bed at night, the whole bed falls apart and the bottom flat sheet is so small it can't even be tucked in?? Your whole bed is a mess during the night because nothing stays put. Can't we expect a better linen set up at a Hyatt???? The water in our bathroom sink trickled out, very annoying. They give you very minimal amount of towels. The air conditioning in our room broke. They had to send an engineer up to fix it. I have had 7 years of college!! I think I understand how a thermostat works!! But I had to listen to instructions anyway. If you set it for 72 degrees, then that the desired level, what a concept!!!!!!!!!! My husband was not very impressed with the buffet breakfast, the eggs were always cold, and the potatoes greasy. I was also not impressed with the lunch they gave us at the conference. This area is outstanding with excellent restaurants!!!! IF ONLY YOU COULD PARK YOUR CAR AT YOUR HOTEL the geographic position of this hotel is ideal. The room was clean, but sparse, and again the bed linens were a nightmare, but excellent bed. The people that are still with me here I wonder if this little tiny thing means something to you. The pens were the cheapest I have seen in my life. So you gotta know they are trying to cut corners in every way possible. I have thousands of pharmaceutical pens, so you get used to nice ones. Thank you for listening, no, not ever would I stay here again. If I am going to put money into a hotel, I want something back, and especially convenience in parking. You guys, listen, EXCELLENT HOTEL: THE RITZ-CARLTON IN MARINA DEL REY. We have to say that this hotel exceeds the standards of Mayfair London. The Ritz was the first hotel that my husband and I actually wanted to live at!!!!! Now we see why movie stars love hotel living. Please, stay at the Ritz, you will love it.

Connected to the hotel is a massive health club, for which they charge $13 ($11 for Gold Passport members). The health club also has a juice bar which serves excellent sandwiches.

The stay was disappointing from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. When we arrived at 4:30 p.m., our rooms were not ready. They were supposed to be ready at 3:00 p.m. The front desk didn't know when they would be ready and told us to go sit buy the pool and buy $8 drinks. The pool area is very nice with a large pool with lanes and a whirlpool. When we arrived at the pool, there were no places to sit. Finally a table opened up and we sat down. After an hour, I went back to the front desk and inquired about the rooms. They were still not ready and the front desk still had no idea when they would be ready. It is now 5:30 p.m. Front desk told us we could use the Regency Club during our stay due to the delay. I thought this was a nice gesture. We went up to the Regency Club and started to get drinks and food, when the front desk saying they would be right up with our keys. So we only got a quick soda thinking the keys would be right up. A half an hour later, the keys finally arrived. When we got to the rooms, the refrigerators had not arrived, so then we had to wait for the refrigerators until we could leave. The rooms did not face the pool as promised, which was to the west so we could watch the sunsets. The Regency Club wasn't available after the first visit, different from we were told. Finally, the refrigerators arrived and we left. The next problem was that we could not get on the internet in our room. Its bad enough that the Hyatt charges $9.95 per night, per room for internet service, but we were not able to get on. We called the front desk and were told that an engineer would come up to get us connected, but they never showed up that first night. We called again the next morning and were told an engineer would be up, but they never showed up again. We were finally able to talk to an engineer, but they were unable to get us connected. So I would not count on internet connectivity in this hotel. And it is very troubling that the front desk told me twice that someone would come to the room to connect us to the internet, and no one ever came. Another thing to be aware of is that in the King room there is no desk. So if you plan to work, you should get a room with two queen beds, which includes a desk. Also, there are virtually no available electrical outlets in the rooms other than those needed for the television. Also, there is no phone book in the room. Another situation to be aware of is that you must be 18 years old to enter the work out facility. We were traveling with two 16 year olds who needed to work out related to extra curricular activities, and were stopped at the door by an attendant and told they could not enter because they were not 18 years old. They asked if they could come in if a parent was with them and were told \"no\". Next, I would recommend avoiding a room at the end of a hallway. In my room there could be heard a loud banging noise on an intermittent basis during both the second and third nights of our stay. I reported this to the front desk and they told me they would look into it, but I never heard back from them and the noise continued right up until we left on Wednesday morning. At checkout, they told me they checked but that there was no noise, which only added to my growing frustration after two sleepless nights in their 4 star hotel. Also at checkout, they had charges from one of their restaurants on my bill which I never stepped foot in, so I had to go through the process of having that removed from my bill. Another situation to be aware of is that if you happen to use Hyatt points for your stay, at this Hyatt that does not cover valet parking. When I have used Hyatt points in the past, I have never had to pay for parking. The valet parking was $25.00 per night. Self parking was $20.00 per night. Finally, when we were leaving, we carried all of the luggage out to where we load the car. I received a call while waiting on the car, so when the car arrived the doorman just started cramming all of the luggage into the trunk. When I saw him doing this I told him to stop, but he just kept right on cramming. By the time I could get off the phone he had the trunk full with about 2/3 of our luggage. I came and told him to stop - again - that we had more to go in the trunk and you couldn't just throw all the luggage in their in some haphazard fashion. In the process of his cramming stuff in, a Christmas ornament was broken (which we found out after we arrived home). So then I had to pull the luggage out of the trunk and repack it. This is the most dismal stay I have had at a Hyatt. We were very disappointed. I tried to limit my comments to keep the length manageable. I would not stay at this Hyatt again even for free. It is not conveniently located, not even to La Jolla. This hotel is at least 3 miles from La Jolla. It is not close to a beach. It does have any good views. It does have a Melting Pot, Flemings, and Japengo's (sushi) right next door that you can walk to, but if you don't want to spend $50 to $100 per person for a meal, you have to drive somewhere.

Excellent pool and athletic facilities and the hotel looks to be an ideal choice for holding an event. As a Hyatt Diamond member, there were a few shortcomings. First and foremost, Hyatt guarantees the \"best rate\" if you book on its website but, clearly, this is not the case as many of the reviews here indicate a much cheaper rate on Priceline or the like. That is deceptive in my opinion. Your best customers should be offered your best prices (especially if you advertise that they are). Regency Club upgrade, decent, well stocked Club Room with Internet access and computers. No Diamond gift or manager welcome note. $25 is what we were charged for valet and, give half a dozen in and outs, I don't consider this outrageous. Good choice of restaurants in the hotel and within a 100 meter walk.

Those people should just pay the additional charge and work from their room if they have a laptop. Some people were surfing the web. I used it briefly a couple times to check work emails, but many times there were lines of people waiting to use them. The rooms were freshly redecorated with quality furniture and bedding. The linens were high quality, which was nice. There is nothing worse than scratchy towels and bedding when traveling. Well, there is a lot worse, but that is a pet peeve of mine. Elevators were very fast, but it would be nice if the top levels had their own elevators. While the banks are split from lower to higher, it can take a long time to get from the top floors to lobby level when it stops at every floor. Some people do not know elevator etiquette and jam themselves in an already-crowded elevator instead of waiting for the next one. But that happens everywhere, not just at hotels. It just would be nice to have express elevators for the top few floors (similar to some hotels in Las Vegas). Everything was clean clean clean! Mrs. Clean and Mr. Fixit must work here. Everything was in tip-top shape. The employees were extremely nice, every single one we met. Parking was expensive, but what do you expect? You're in San Diego.

No good family restaurants were in area, though there is a large shopping mall within a mile or two. Hard to find a gas station in this area, too.

I ordered flowers through the e-coinsures and they were suppose to be in the room when we arrived, which they were not. I ended up getting roses even though I ordered gerber daisies. The best part was that they did not write anything on the card. I had nice message that was a surprise for my wife and they forgot to put the card with the flowers. I call down to the front desk and am on hold for 10 minutes and when I finally get to talk to someone they tell me they will have to talk to a manager. 40 minutes later a manager calls back and says that they will provide an extravagant gift for their blunder. They sent up a fruit plate, which consisted of a green banana, apple and orange. I could have walked to the closest store and spent $2 for this so called extravagant gift. After dinner and a night cap my wife and I go back to the room. We call room service to see if we can get a bottle of wine. They say no and my wife calls back to try and see why they can't give us a bottle of wine. When she calls the man on the other end refers to her as a drunk and tells her to raid the mini-bar. My wife is insulted I'm angry so I go downstairs to talk to the manager and he tells me that I am just a customer that can't be made happy and there is nothing he can do. So at 1am my wife and I pack our bags and leave the hotel on our Honeymoon! Absolutely, the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The incompetence of the manager and staff was unbelievable.

The employee stated that he was \"accustomed to people changing rooms due to the stink\". I asked him why they continued to use such products, he said that they had to or the rooms would smell worse. Wonder what they are masking, mold? Who knows. Scary. I have no idea when the hotel was built but indoors it has the feel of a much older hotel than the outside re-furbish belies. The mattresses were thin and hard and the bedding was totally substandard and not comfortable. We checked out the next morning as soon as possible.

The desk staff were very friendly (and remained so throughout our 8 night stay) and we were in our room after a few minutes. The rooms are not big but they more than make up for it terms of comfort and ambience. The furnishings were pleasant and comfortable. The bed and pillows were comfortable although ours squeaked a little bit, but not enough to cause us any problems. I am sure if we'd wanted to do something about it, it would have been no problem. On the 11th floor we had a very nice view of the pool area and the hotel grounds. The ability to open a big window was also a very nice feature. The tv is an old style set but it's no big shakes to me. The bathroom was small but immaculate throughtout our stay. The shower was fine, which was a blessing after our previous hotel. The products were generally good too, although I found the soap dried my skin too much so had to stop using it. The only complaint in this area was that the towels were a little scratchy and could use replacing. The hotel has a small coffee bar that is open til 11am which serves tea, coffee and pastries. This is a blessing since the buffet breakfast is a little on the expensive side. I also used the outdoor heated swimming pool a couple of times. Although I am sure there was somewhere to change, I couldn't find it so used the mens room. It's a nice facility to have and that it's heated makes a difference especially in december when I was there. Parking is also a little expensive and this is certainly a deterrent from using it at $16 a day. As is the distance from the car park to the hotel itself, vast areas are sectioned off for valet parking which means self parking is relegated to the distant spots. We gave up on it the first day we were there and parked on the street for free and usually closer to the hotel entrances. For a decent breakfast outside the hotel I recomend Le Peep, it's a few minutes drive to Towne Centre Drive, located in the shopping plaza. It's not the big Westfield UTC mall, but a smaller plaza a couple of hundred yards further along the road. Be aware it shuts at 2pm. Nearby shopping at UTC is excellent, one of the best malls in San Diego IMO. There's also a smaller mall and AMC movie theatre across the I5 freeway, visible from the hotel, you can use Nobel Rd to get there easily. Overall, this is my second favourite hotel in San Diego, (after the Omni), it's convienient for most of the city, it's comfortable and the staff are excellent.

After searching from top to bottom in our room several times, we went to report the matter to the front desk. The lady at the desk was very nice and polite and immediately called security for us. When the gentlemen from security came, he asked us what the problem was; after we told him what happened, he asked us what we wanted him to do. I was completely shocked by this response as it was completely unprofessional. We asked him to check who had entered the room besides us from the time of our arrival. He told us he would know immediately if anyone else had entered and that he would call us. We waited for several hours and never received a phone call. We finally called the hotel and they claimed that we were the only ones who had entered the room. We then returned to the hotel so that we could see the security report. They claimed that they could not print it out to show us. It was only when my older brother asked for the manager and asked her to show us the report did they finally decide that they could comply with our request (we had to wait about 20 minutes to finally see it). According to them, we must have lost the folder while we were in the room. There was never an apology for the inconvenience. The manager that we spoke to was neither polite nor apologetic.

They have a wonderful decor and are roomy (by San Diego standards). We ate a couple meals there because we where lazy and didn't want to go out and eat, the first night I thought the prices where way to high, but as the week went on I realized that $60 is pretty much the norm for 2 people. The people that work here are great they remember you and are willing to do just about anything to make you feel at home. A couple days into our vacation our shower was broken (it only put out hot water) and with in 10 mins the maintenance guy was in our room fixing it. They are very willing to help so don't be afraid to ask. ALL THE BAD: When we arrived I asked if they did anything special for people on their anniversary, the registration guy said yes, he gave us a key to the 16th floor which has the regency club (so free snacks, breakfast and etc.) He also said he would send a couple things to our room; however my husband and I never saw that stuff. We went back a couple days later to just inquire as to what had happened and this guy said he would send those up right away, We still have not seen the stuff. As a person who travels every once in a while, I thought for a hotel of this caliber we would have to pay for our meals, V parking... the obvious, but when we got a bill and we realized that they charged us $1.07 for each local call we made (mainly to restaurants to get directions) my husband was not happy. I will tell you up front you have to pay for EVERYTHING extra; the internet is like $10.... just stupid stuff. This is just me but I watch TV before I go to bed to wined down, but the connection was crappy, a few (2 or 3) stations were distorted, had some snow, just stuff that got on my nerves.

It's a lovely hotel from the outside, and the people I've dealt with have been friendly. The problem at this hotel is the housekeeping. This could be an isolated problem, and maybe even one housekeeper. My non-smoking room, has a bathroom that smells like an ash tray. Either the previous guests smoked in the bathroom, and it was never cleaned properly by housekeeping, or housekeeping smokes while he/she cleans the bathroom. I also found hair on my new clean pillow case. I blew this off as \"possibly the housekeeper's hair.\" This is now my second night here, and after returning to my room, I found that my bathroom was not cleaned. My own hair was still in the tub and on the floors. Which leads me to believe that nothing was vacumed or wiped down. If housekeeping can leave the obvious things undone, I am very concerned about the not so obvious things. I am getting more and more paranoid about the original hair in my bed (maybe it was the previous guests or maybe my sheets were never changed). I have already signed and scheduled an event for my company here next month, and I regret doing this. I have a few executives flying out to this event, and I will be embarrassed if they have the same \"unclean\" experience. I do plan to write the manager (my first time ever) and complain. This is a fairly expensive hotel, so my expectations are high. I have stayed at less expensive hotels where rooms were immaculate. The housekeeping staff at least on the 8th floor needs some re-training or replaced. If you're concerned about cleanliness, especially with a $250 nightly price tag...then this is probably not your hotel.

Frontdesk is nice, valet parking is ok but nothing special. But let's look at our room. We were in a \"Petite Suite\", a large room.... with a fold-away bed that can go in the wall like you see in old movies. The bed is no good at all. We woke up every morning with a backpain. It's about 1 feet from the ground so getting out of bed is no picknick either. When i required if there were suites with other beds, the anser was\" No, but we can connect a room next to yours and make it a 1 bedroom suite. The suite wil then be turned in to a living room\". How much will that be ? O, just another $200,-. So thh room total would be $500,- per night, but than i would probably have a reasonable king. Obviously one can not expect a good bed for the $ 300 a night i was already paying. Mind you, $ 500 a night was a discount of no less than $ 28 from the regular rate.... Lets talk showers. Do you like a good shower after you get up in the morning ? Well, if you do, don't visit the Hyatt La Jolla. The \"suite\" i was in had a bathroom that resembled a motel 6, but i personally think the motel 6 has a better shower. No bath in this bathroom, but what can you expect for just $ 300 a night. Certainly not a shower with any waterpressure whatsoever. You can not get wet in this shower, it has a showerhead with almost no water coming out of it. It takes forever just to wash the shampoo out of your hear. This bathroom is the worst i have ever seen in ANY hotel. So, considering everything, $300 a night doesn't get you a good bed and it doesn't get you a good bathroom. My advise : Do not go to this hotel !!!! I certainly never will.

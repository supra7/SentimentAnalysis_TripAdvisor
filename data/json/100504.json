We joined their Kimpton Hotel loyalty plan and have been treated like treasured guests ever since. Their stated goal is to be the \"most loved\" hotel company and they have certainly endeared themselves to us. On this trip their dedication to top-notch customer service was evident even before we arrived. We were staying downtown to celebrate my husband's birthday. I had reserved an upgraded room online, but then worried later that it might not be one of their dog-friendly rooms. I called to make certain it was all okay and spoke to a really nice woman (wish I'd gotten her name) who assured me that there are dog-friendly rooms of each kind and that our reservation was all in order. She noted that we are members of the Kimpton In-Touch program and that we were going to be there for a special occasion. She asked if we would like to have a bottle of wine or champagne in the room. I stammered a bit and said that actually we are micro-brewed beer hounds. She said she would see what she could do. So, we arrived downtown around 1pm and thought we'd see if they would let us leave our car there while we went to eat lunch and wait for our room to be ready. We were delighted to find out that our room was already available and we could unload the car. The valet was very sweet to our dog and helped us juggle the luggage, dog, jackets, keys, etc. Inside they have an adorable chalkboard with the names of all the dog guests posted. They also give you a little gift bag with dog treats, a dog toy, and clean-up bags. The lobby has a lot of seating areas, a fireplace, chess set, and complimentary wine around 5ish. I'm not sure what the decorating scheme would be called, but it's warm and comfortable as opposed to a lot of the trendy places with hard surfaces and mod colors. Our room was decorated in a similar fashion to the lobby and included a sofa, lounge chair and desk with desk chair. There was also a bed on the floor for our dog. The bed for the humans was huge and had crisp linens and lots of pillows. The bathroom was a nice size and instead of those little bottles of shampoo and such they had large dispenser bottles in the shower. Probably better for the environment. After dropping our things we went out to explore the city. The hotel is in a great central location and you can leave your car there and walk all over the place. When we came back a couple of hours later there were three bottles of Pike Place Brewery ales chilling in a bucket of ice. There was also a personalized card written to my husband wishing him a happy 56th birthday. It was signed by the Chief Concierge, Jesse Peterson. Too cool! The next day we had a really delicious brunch at the adjoining restaurant, Sazerac. After we returned home I filled out an online questionnaire and gave them high marks for making us feel so special while we were at the hotel. I then received a 'thank you' email from the Director of Operations and it wasn't a form letter! These people are SERIOUS about customer service. I have recently slacked-off on writing reviews because it's time consuming and I feel a little bit like \"why would anyone care what I think\", but when a company puts so much time and effort into making sure I'm happy I'm glad to talk about them to anyone who will listen.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThis might be our favorite Kimpton\u201d", "Author": "tikiville", "ReviewID": "UR125768347", "Content": "We made last minute reservations (day before) for an overnight in Seattle.

We had a Monaco King room which was pretty spacious, with a desk area, lots of room, and a really comfortable bed. The only thing I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really crazy about was our shower had built in dispensers of shampoo and conditioner instead of individual bottles. They do, however, offer a handful of amenities at the front desk such as toothpaste and the like if you forget to pack them (some free, others for a fee). We had an issue with our mini fridge, and not only did they service it right away but they immediately brought a cold drink from the bar downstairs since what we wanted from the fridge wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cold.

One of the first things I noticed when we got to our room was that the upholstered chair next to the bed was in tatters. No kidding. In at least four places it was not just threadbare, but literally torn down to the stuffing. For a hotel of this quality, this is completely unacceptable. Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought. But that was before we added in the cost to valet park. It's posted $36 a night, but with taxes it was about $44/night.

You know the kind--they look you up and down, decide you are not worthy, and act like checking you in is a big favor. Normally, I could care less, but we'd just arrived from a long train journey, it was dark and rainy out, we had our discombobulated 7-year-old in tow, and could have used some 'hail fellow well met' at that moment. Publicity boasts about catering to the young uns, but I had to search the website the next day to see what was available for him, and then ask, which put the morning staff in a flutter, because the person who checked us in--I'm looking at you, chilly night check-in guy--should have taken care of it. A much heralded gold fish was brought to our room, which then died. Okay, it happens, it is a living thing, but when we called to have it removed--more 7-year-old discombobulation--we were cheerfully told to put it outside the door, and chirpily asked if we'd like another. I know it's just a fish, but the attitude seemed rather cavalier, especially with a child involved. Yes, they have coffee and tea, but 2 days in a row I had to tell them they'd run out of hot water, breakfast tea, and milk. Don't count on it if you are off to business meetings in the morning as I was. And then there is the nickle and diming that I just can't stand when I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel room--one-ply toilet tissue, big bottles of shampoo and soap bolted to the wall, slippers with a \"if-you-use-these-we'll-charge-you-$15\" tag attached to them.

The complimentary morning coffee and hot chocolate bar in the lobby was fantastic in the morning as was the wine in the evening. While we missed dining in the restaurant it looked divine and my travel colleague had been several times and sang its praises.

I also poked around on the lower floor and would recommend this hotel for business / corporate meetings as well. A nice surprise after arriving home - the manager followed up with personal email.

While I was looking for a place to live, I chanced across Hotel Monaco and took up residence there for eight days. From the moment I was met at the valet on the first day to the day they handed the keys back to me, I enjoyed every aspect of the stay. Every member of the staff made me feel not only like a valued customer but that they genuinely cared about my comfort. I have stayed in many fine hotels in the past and have experienced great customer service but not really at this level. Upon check-in, I was informed on how best to take advantage of my stay and ways to save money. After having enrolled in their rewards program, they upgraded me to a suite. The room was more than tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The turn down service left two chocolates on the pillow and if I timed it right, they would cut me in a couple more ;-) The restaurant, Sazerac is not a name you will remember but you certainly will remember the experience. The only complaint is that it was so well liked, the place was packed by 5:30pm. Breakfast was just as good as dinner and reasonably priced (as far as breakfasts go for four star hotels). And the relationship was tested as well: Upon check out, I had learned that I had been charged for a bottle of wine I had not consumed. I figured that it was due to a bottle I had brought in and left out on the table. Simple mistake and simply explained. But I did wonder how this would be dealt with. No problem. I explained that I did not drink the bottle of wine and that they were welcome to run inventory and if it was missing they could put it on my tab. No need. They took my word for it and took it off the tab on the spot. Simple thing. Big relief. I've had simpler things ruin a stay.

I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn't have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV's and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn't as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we've been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the \"con\" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren't as attractive as some others I've stayed at in Seattle. It's only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you're expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there.

I booked the rooms for an amazing price ($70/nt) through Priceline. Because of this, I was concerned we may be treated like 2nd class citizens but that was certainly not the case. Prior to arrival, I phoned the front desk and asked about a room upgrade. I expected to be charged for this but to my surprise, the front desk clerk advised me that if I sign up for the hotel's free rewards program, I could get a free room upgrade. So he proceeded to sign me up over the phone and then upgraded our room to a King Suite with jacuzzi tub. It was fabulous! (Thank you Jason!) The room was lovely. The rewards program also included a $10 credit for the \"Raid the Mini Bar\" program and free wireless internet. I had also asked Jason if he could arrange for a birthday note or something to be left in the room for my husband. Well, he did better than that. In our room we found a bottle of sparkling brut wine and a bag of chocolates. Wow! One of my favourite things about the hotel is their HosPETality Program. Amazing! We weren't charged extra to have our dog. She was welcome throughout the hotel except the restaurant so during the free wine hour in the lobby from 5-6pm, I sat sipping my wine with my dog at my side. You are allowed to leave your pet in your room unattended while you shop or dine, providing the pet is well behaved. Just leave a contact number at the front desk in case of problems. You'll be given a little sign to hang on your doorknob alerting staff to the presence of your animal. If you don't feel comfortable with this, the front desk offers pet sitting on a first come-first serve basis. Your pet can be tethered behind the front desk to hang with the staff for up to 5 hours. First hour is free and then only $5/hour. The staff here were wonderful. One day we arrived back at our room to find a dog dish with our dog's name written on it piled high with dog cookies and a stuffed goldfish toy. :o) The goldfish signifies another program of the hotel. If you are lonely during your stay, just ask for a pet goldfish and one will be delivered to your room in a little fish bowl, complete with name tag. The hotel does have an attached restaurant that seems quite funky but we dined there on a Sunday night which had a limited menu so I can't comment on the food. Parking is valet and quite costly at about $38/night. However, I think that's pretty standard for hotels in that area. There is no pool/spa but there is a small, adequate fitness room. So if you like a nice soak, upgrade to a room with a jacuzzi tub! I was so impressed with this hotel and its staff.

There is a lovely wine and beer reception in the lobby each evening and it was fun to see all the pooches hanging around this dog-friendly establishment.

Which means easy walking distance (or a quick cab ride away, at most) to many fantastic restaurants and city attractions. None of these things are a surprise when staying at a Kimpton hotel, and I've stayed at several. What was beyond the exceptional ordinary was the attention given to a Kimpton InTouch Rewards Program issue (the hotel's guest loyalty program) I had with one of their properties I usually stay at in Portland. I sent an email to the Hotel Monaco's manager prior to our stay regarding the previous oversights of the Portland property, inquiring if they might give some attention to the matter. Within twenty minutes I received a reply. WOW! They assured me the problem was being researched so that it wouldn't happen again. They were prompt, responsive and made a service recovery on behalf of the other property when it wasn't even \"their\" issue. Not only that, my beau had garnered this particular reservation via Priceline, so we were already getting a fabulous rate to begin with. When we arrived, there was a bottle of wine, chocolate and a lovely card waiting for us. The valet attendant made our life easier by offering to keep our car parked curbside since we needed to leave soon after our arrival. Our room was upgraded to a suite and and it was fabulous. I'm a longtime hospitality veteran with years in the hotel industry. True customer service seems to be a dying art, and yet Kimpton manages to hire, train and maintain a staff of people who seem to find joy in elevating the quality of a guest's stay. Bravo to you all! It's why I keep coming back and why I refer others to these properties.

But I'm not quite sure what make it \"luxury\" in nature. The rooms are small, but that's to be expected I suppose in a big city. However, I had a chance to visit a different hotel, a 3 star, in the same area, and the rooms were 2x as big. The rooms were decorated in a very boutique quality, with red/white stripes. The bathrooms were small, and very very plain. Nothing close to some of the luxury hotels I've stayed in in the past. But the hotel was very clean, comfortable, and in walking distance of most of the downtown attractions, which was what I was looking for. For the price I got on Hotwire, it was great. For the regular going luxury hotel price, not so much. Now the hospitality. The hotel staff were very nice for the most part, but I had read so many reviews about how they went above and beyond. This was not the case when I visited. I looked like crap when I arrived at the hotel - after delays at the airport, and 2 layovers, I looked about 15 years old, with terrible bed hair. I got to the hotel in the middle of the day, and the two doorman just looked at me. No \"Let me grab the door\" or \"Let me help you with your luggage.\" Just looked at me, grunted a \"hey, good afternoon\" and went back to talking. This ended up being the last time I ever saw a doorman for my entire weekend stay. Got to the front desk, and immediately, the clerk judged either my appearance, or my booking through Hotwire. He mumbled a few things about the hotel, gave me my key, and went back to doing whatever he was doing. A girl at the desk was checking in a different customer, a older, male gentleman, and went through a clear, welcoming explanation of the hotel and amenities, and asked if he was a Klimpton member. He said no, and she explained how he could sign up for free internet. All of which was never even asked, or mentioned to me. I looked back at my clerk and said \"Um, Im a member. how do I access the internet?\" He suddenly became a lot nicer. From then on, I really didn't bother with the hotel staff. The cleaning crew were very nice and helpful however. They helped me out when I couldn't find my toothpaste and the front desk said \"Oh we ran out.\" uh. huh. The last day I needed a taxi, and told the front desk to call one 10mins before I checked out (Seattle is not known for its cab services...so you really have to call in advance). I walked out...no cab. \"Oh we called! He should be here asap\" 10mins later, no cab. I asked the front desk to call again, and they said \"Oh sure, in a bit\" Um. No. I ended up taking a gypsy cab that I hailed myself that cost me 2x as much, but I had a business meeting and I was nearly late.

The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive. Monaco is a tremendous location: next door to Starbucks (though there is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings); a block from the Capitol Grill; and easy walking to the retail core.

The location was good for us and anyone who doesn't have issues with moderate walking -- it was a multi-block walk to Pikes Market, the waterfront, etc. -- you do have up hill walking when you return to the hotel from Pikes Market or the waterfront, though we found some streets to be less steep than others (Union Street, for instance). From the moment we arrived at the hotel we found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful, and this continued throughout our stay -- the valet, doorman, front desk reps, concierge, housekeeping, etc. Each time we were leaving the hotel, the front desk people would acknowledge us with pleasantries such as \"have a nice day\"; upon our return they would again acknowledge us with \"welcome back\", or something similar. The evening wine event in the lobby was a very nice touch. The overall feel of the hotel was that it was nicely decorated and clean and felt welcoming. The room was also nicely decorated and clean and larger than the average hotel room. There was ample comfortable seating, i.e. two upholstered chairs and a very comfortable desk chair at the large desk. Also, the room had multiple sources of bright lighting -- best lighting of any hotel we've stayed in. There was a nice size flat screen TV, stocked mini-fridge (items for purchase), stocked snack tray (also for purchase), and a room safe as well. Though coffee service is provided in the lobby each morning, there is no coffee service in the room, however, you can request a set-up for your room, if desired. The beds were extremely comfortable, i.e. the mattress, linens, comforter, and pillows. The air conditioner worked great and you are able to control the temp. to your liking from the in-room thermostat. The bathroom, too, was larger than usual. The shower head was to die for and with great water pressure, so you didn't have to spend a longer-than-usual amount of time in the shower trying to shower with a trickle of water, as is the case in many hotels (especially important to those of us with longer, thicker hair). They also had a wall-mounted rack containing full-size pump bottles of shampoo, cream rinse, and liquid bath soap. A hair dryer was also provided. You should know ahead of time, as we did, that many of the rooms face directly towards another high rise, in close proximity, especially if you want a room with two beds versus a king; we were told that there are no two bed rooms not facing the building; besides not having a view or much natural light, this necessitates keeping your curtains closed for privacy -- but, again, at least there's great lighting provided in the room. There are only two things I would add to my wish list for the hotel -- one is to have at least some two-bed rooms that don't face a building and the second is to provide larger than the standard size bath towels.

We concluded our vacation with 2 nights at the Hotel Monaco, a Kimpton hotel in Seattle, Washington. We had a delightful vacation, with great service and food offerd in our two previous locations. We chose to stay at the Monaco because we have stayed at Kimpton hotels on at least three previous trips, in different cities, and enjoyed the experiences. It was an easy choice for us to stay at the Hotel Monaco. We arrived on time and after a fairly long travel day (6 hours of driving from Whistler with a couple of stops en route) and were greeted warmly by the staff - at the curb at check in and by the counter staff when registering. When we inquired about dining alternatives, it was suggested we consider the on-premises restaurant, Sazerac. We quickly visited the restaurant prior to checking in to our rooms, found the menu to be inviting and the restaurant itself to be warm and comfortable. We enjoyed the wine sampling in the lobby during early evening and dinner at the restaurant was so good we decided to return the next day, after spending the day walking and touring the more popular areas of downtown Seattle on foot. Dinner the second evening was just a good as the first night. Importantly, the concierge of the hotel, the wait staff at the restaurant and all associates with whom we interacted at the hotel were simply superb. I am in the \"customer servce business\" myself so I have more than a passing interest in observing quality service delivered by other businesses. The hotels of Kimptom we have previosly visited are consistent...clean, very neat, more of a \"boutique\" sense, generaly reasonably located and fairly priced. We offer our unqualifed recommendation of the Kimptom hotel group.

I've never actively searched out a hotel group, but after this stay, I'll go out of my way to stay at a Kimpton Hotel. (And yes, I'm actually embarrassed to go on like a walking advertisement, but our time there was amazing and I feel it's warranted.) The best thing Hotel Monaco has going for it is its service - from the front desk to the valets to the housekeeping. It's refreshing to come into contact with staff who don't come across as disenchanted with the organization. I sheepishly asked about getting a goldfish for our room and, I swear, they were more excited to arrange for one than I was about getting it (special thanks to Shaynee and Hayden). The doormen/valets were exceptional (special thanks to Nick) and always friendly. Housekeeping gave such special care to our room that I felt guilty using anything in the bathroom. The second best thing, is the location. The Monaco is so centrally located that we questioned whether we truly needed a car during our stay there. It's about a 10-minute (lovely) walk to the Market down streets that are interesting in their own right, and about 3 minutes from amazing shopping. The Sazerac is a happening place - great food (you must try the dates) and atmosphere - and you feel lucky to have it available to you downstairs, as opposed to other hotel restaurants that \"will do\" if you're simply too tired to venture out. The fitness room is more than adequate and, while I didn't use the business center, it looked to have everything you would need. And if you have the option of getting a room with a jacuzzi, DO IT - they're spacious and deep. The Hotel only has valet parking which, I'll admit, can add up quickly. I had read online that the Kimpton group strives to be environmentally responsible and therefore offers a discount for those driving hybrids. This came in handy when we had the choice to rent a Prius. Upon check-out, I was informed by the staff that Monaco had a special promotion during the month of August whereby valet/parking was complimentary for those driving eco-friendly cars! I wasn't sure whether I was more impressed by the creative promotion or pleased that I'd saved a significant amount of money, but I walked away elated. Prior to arriving, we filled out a Kimpton membership (at no cost), which asks for preferences on everything from room placement to pillow firmness to your choice of daily newspaper. I filled it out, doubtful that it would actually be taken into account; yet, upon arrival, I found that we had indeed been reserved a corner room with firm pillows and the daily Seattle Times. In addition, there was a card in our room welcoming us to the Program and entitling us to $10 worth of mini-bar purchases (from which there were many to choose). I realize that I may be gushing here, but our experience was so wonderful that, even though the hotel is not the cheapest in Seattle, we left feeling like we'd gotten a steal. Before our trip we'd been torn between staying at the Westin or taking a chance on this boutique, and I'm so happy we chose the latter.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cLeopard print bathrobes; enough said.\u201d", "Author": "akubelly", "ReviewID": "UR77018057", "Content": "Stayed here by myself on a business trip and wished I was with someone.

I had done extensive research on the downtown Seattle hotels before the trip. We wanted one that's near the attractions we could walk to, nice and clean rooms, friendly service, with a good price. I had several choices and decided on Hotel Monaco based on the reviews I read on this web site. It seemed to get consistent positive reviews. Well, we were not disappointed! In fact, we were very happy about our choice!! We had requested an early check-in since we disembarked in the morning. The rooms weren't ready yet, but the front desk girls who were very friendly and plesant told us she will call my cell phone when the rooms are ready. They happily stored away our luggages so we could go explore the town. They also showed us on the map how to get to certain places. A friend traveling with us was a librarian and the Seattle Central library was on her list of must-see. Image the plesant surprise when she found out the library was just across the street from the hotel! A couple of hours later, they called us to let us know our rooms were ready. I can't say enough about the front desk girls' plesant and courteous attitude - it just made us feel very welcome. The rooms were beautifully and tastefully decorated. And they were spacious!! This was important as we had tons of luggage from our week-long cruise. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I liked the little gift shop that's at the end of the hotel. The next morning, we were plesantly surprised by the complementary Starbucks coffee, ice coffee, and banana cakes. Those cakes were so good!! They went perfect well with the coffee. Hmm... Wish I had some of them now... Overall, we were very pleased with our stay in Hotel Monaco. I could tell the hotel was making every effort to make sure the guests were welcome and comfortable. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in downtown Seattle.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cwarm and hospitable\u201d", "Author": "riverworld", "ReviewID": "UR67042257", "Content": "Very centrally located for shopping and night life.

I love Kimpton properties. I tried staying at another non-Kimpton property and I regretted it to the point where I canceled my second night and booked at the Hotel Monaco. So, I was coming in to town from out of the country and I arrived late... probably around 10:15 or so. I was tired, frustrated, and just wanted food and a bed. The front desk clerk was so nice and kind to me; it made the difference. I had a room on the 11th floor, which I assume is because I'm a Kimpton In Touch member. I loved it! I love being on high floors. When I got in to the room, it was warm, cozy, and everything that I love. The bed was incredible and the bathroom was large and clean. I have a thing for bathrooms. Instead of dining downstairs, I decided to hop in the shower and order room service. I ordered a turkey bacon pannini at 10:45 and was told it would be about 25 minutes. I waited and waited, and finally I called at 11:45. Apparently my order got missed. They were quick to correct it and I had my sandwich by midnight. They did not charge me and they even gave me an adorable bag of chocolates. I appreciated their apology and effort to rectify the situation; I was more than happy, even if it was delayed. The only thing is, they still didn't get the sandwich correct; there was no bacon on the one that was delivered to me, which is what I was sorta craving. No matter... the sandwich was still delish and really enjoyed it. Just like I have a thing for bathrooms, I also have a thing for robes. The one thing I do not like about Kimpton are the robes. They are a funky animal pattern and the robes always seem kinda worn and faded. I can appreciate Kimpton's effort to be funky, original, and very chic through a simple feature, but there has to be a better option. It's not a big deal, but just sayin'... I love the shampoo, conditioner, and soap at the Hotel Monaco. I don't know who makes it or what the fragrance is, but it smells elegant and earth, organic and exotic, all at the same time. The products were in the shower in a pump, so I couldn't bring any home to research the products. When I like a hotel product, I try to bring the travel size home so I can research where I can get some for myself. Anyone know what products Hotel Monaco uses? Also, as a KIT member, I received a voucher for two free honor bar items. I didn't use the voucher, but it was a nice and appreciated touch. The valets were wonderful when I arrived and when I checked out. And when I got in my car, there was a little package with crackers and juice, tied with a little bow, and a card inside that said, \"We miss you already.\" It made me smile, and I missed them, too! ;-) I cannot wait to stay at my next Kimpton hotel... and I cannot wait to go back to the Hotel Monaco!", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cOne of my favorite hotels.\u201d", "Author": "PattyDMD", "ReviewID": "UR66800358", "Content": "This was my second year staying at The Hotel Monaco Seattle for business.

We decided on Hotel Monaco simply based on location (which is terrific) and pricing. From the moment we walked in, our experience was wonderful. I booked online and received the option of an upgrade which we received at a fantastic price. Let me first state that I am self employed (I own a tattoo studio) and I have found my outward appearance to have a negative impact when I travel, especially in nicer hotels. That was absolutely not our experience with Hotel Monaco... we were treated well and every staff we came across was warm and welcoming. We arrived a few hours prior to check in, our plan was to use the time to grab some lunch. The staff gladly secured our belongings and offered to call us when our room was ready. It was ready much earlier than expected. Both the front staff and porters were wonderful. They were quick to offer a hand and point us in the right direction when asked. The room was fantastic and the housekeeping staff was unusually happy and friendly. On our second night, we ate at the hotel's restaurant. We came in late and it was a busy night. I ordered a vegetarian dish. Soon the restaurant manager politely informed me that they were out of that dish... he had already consulted the chef and had recommendations readily available that met my dietary preferences. It was one of the best meals I'd eaten in a long time. Staff checked in soon after my first bite to make sure I was happy with everything, I couldn't have been happier. Upon checkout, again our train was leaving later than our check out time. Our bags were again securely stored even though we were no longer really staying at the hotel, when we retrieved them, staff offered to call our taxi and assist us until we were on our way back home. Dumb luck brought us to Hotel Monaco, however the next time we are in Seattle, we will be back because our first experience was so good. I would highly recommend them based on location, the accommodations and of course the wonderful people who really cared that we had a great couple of days away. By the way... this is my first review of a hotel like this. Just like most of you, I'm sure....

I have arrived at this building some 1900 times and WOW has it changed. the building used to house switching machinery and operator services for the phone company. I had requested a Monte Carlo suite. It was huge and wonderfully done in what can only be called eclectic. Color scheme was in red and cream with a headboard in sky blue. My room was graced with a sweet flower arrangement of roses and freesia for which I have Jesse the Chef Concierge(I asked if he had a spit personality) to thank. The bed was a bit hard for my bones but the sheets felt great. I had lunch and dinner at the restaurant Sazerac and both meals were wonderful. Lunch was simple with a marvelous spicy, meaty gumbo and an\"heirloom apple\" salad. The salad was dressed with a simple vinigrette and layered on speck a cured ham. Be warned portions were more than ample. Delicious. I had breakfast in my room the next morning. I had been given coupons for a continental breakfast, alas they weren't good for room service. My meal was served by Matthew a genial fellow who graciously comped my coffee to make up. Prices were typical for a room service menu, and I was served quickly. The food was great. I ordered \"Eggs from Hell\" a spicy little number! A word of warning to those in wheelchairs, only two of the accessible rooms have roll in showers where u can reach the towel rack. In my room the towels were placed on a rack mounted on the back wall out of reach for us wheelies. There also wasn't a handheld shower unusual for an accessible suite. The other access issue I encountered was that door returns on my room and on the business center did not meet the pressure standards in the ADA for opening doors. They were difficult to open and in case of the business center assistance is required as the door was too narrow for someone in a chair. I had to have Jesse open the second door so I could enter the center. The hotel is located downtown at Fourth and Spring sts a great location for shopping, theater and eating out. It was a $5.00 ride from King Street Station. I was treated like a million by all the staff I encountered at the hotel. They made me feel like I was the Sultan of Brunei.

I got a decent rate of $132/night for a room with a King bed. The hotel is definitely fairly well kept up and the service is friendly. I like the fact that they have wine served in the lobby between 5P-6P, and coffee and tea served between 7A-9A, courtesy of the hotel. However, I found that the lobby gets pretty packed with guests wanting their free coffee/wine on the weekends so there's no place to sit down. Also, one morning they ran out of coffee in the lobby, and we had to wait 15 minutes for them to bring out some more. The hotel's restaurant, Sazerac, is a good restaurant with pretty good drinks. It was convenient being able to get a nice dinner in the hotel. Just be sure to make reservations for dinner, since it can get pretty busy there during Happy Hour on the weeknights. The thing I wasn't so happy about with the hotel are its thin walls. I could hear my neighbors talking and moving about, and could really feel the neighbor's kids jumping on the bed. It makes you wonder if there would be any privacy for a romantic weekend, if you get my drift. Also, the doors on the tv cabinet were askew. Also, I'm not sure why it's so difficult to find a decent workout room in a hotel. I tried out Hotel Monaco's fitness room, and found that the equipment was pretty out-dated. The one treadmill in the room wasn't evening working, and they charged guests if they wanted to hook headsets into the tv monitors attached to the machines. There were no mats to sit and stretch on and the quarters were tight. I'm accustomed to cycling machines, but the resistance of Monaco's cycling machine was really off, and I had a difficult time cycling with just a resistance of 2, which should be really easy. Although the goldfish rentals appear to appeal to some, it seems a little abusive to me. I was uncomfortable with seeing the \"used\" goldfish, left out in front of the rooms, once the guests were done with them. Maybe Hotel Monaco should just set up a nice, well-kept stationary fish tank in the lobby for all to enjoy. I bet the fish would be happier, and isn't that the point of the fish tanks? It's supposed to be for animal lovers. Overall, Hotel Monaco was a comfortable place to stay. I like it's smaller size, compared to the Sheraton and Hyatt down the street. It gives it a more cozy feel, and probably encourages more personal service.

Since we had a rental car, we drove around the city for a few hours until checkin. From the second we got there, the guys at the front desk/porter were AMAZING!!!! Since this is your first impression of a hotel, we were already hooked. They are helping you out of your car and have your luggage out almost before u have stopped the car in front! Truly attentive!!!! Our room was nice and comfortably furnished....not cramped....they have several items available if u have forgotten yours (ie; toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, shaving cream, heating pads, etc) and I don't think there is an extra charge for this stuff, but it may be minimal. The girl that checked us in was a little standoffish (maybe she is new?)....she stated that since we made our reservations thru Orbitz, she had limited rooms available to us. While we have long known that hotels usually give the least desirable rooms to people who use a discount travel site, we did not feel everyone in the hotel lobby checking in at the same time, needed to have this information. She told us there was a charge for the internet ($10 a day, I think), coffee in the morning, and I think a wine reception in the evening (we are nondrinkers). When we inquired later about how to use the internet, a different receptionist told us to sign up with the Kimpton Rewards program and we would have free internet for our entire stay. It would have been helpful if we were given this info during the checkin process. The rest of our 3 day stay was uneventful with the front/checkin/out desk....and everyone was very nice. Now back to the Porter service.......WOW! we can't say enough good things about these guys....They truly made our stay a wonderful one. Try them instead of the concierge...they truly know the area and won't give u the names of all the \"Top\" spots, but will give u the names (and directions to boot!) of all the BEST places. While all the Porters were very frindly and helpful, Anthony was the absolute best!, and if any management reads this, please send him our gratitude and note that you have an outstanding employee who would be fabulous with many more customer service responsibilities than working at the front desk/porter area! He made our experience at Hotel Monaco that much better. Tell him hi when u stay at this hotel.......and tip these guys well....they appreciate it and u will be rewarded..... We did not try the restaurant next door.......but they were always packed, so it must have been good food. Instead we tried Rock Bottom a couple of blocks away......GREAT simple food pizza, burgers, etc and not priced over the top. They probably have other stuff ,too, like seafood dishes as everywhere in Seattle does. We also went to a FABULOUS Itallian restaurant called Assaggio's on 3rd and Virginia...EXCELLENT! We stayed at the Westin 3 days prior to our cruise....they are VERY snobby.....especially when you have booked thru \"one of those discount websites\"......don't even bother with the Westin.....go straight to Hotel Monaco where u will be treated right.

Our regular haunts in Seattle were booked, so on a lark, we tried \"Hotwire\" for the first time. We did not know about Hotel Monaco without the benefit of Hotwire, and per the Hotwire instructions I contacted the hotel about room types. Then I read a Tripadviser response from the hotel dated April 7, 2009 that didn't resonate well with us (basically the message I interpreted is that you are hooped if you book Hotel Monaco through Hotwire). Our flights had us arriving early into Seattle and I advised the hotel about the arrival and my partner's condition (made worse by a foot injury a day before our trip). For us, front desk was an exercise in what could not be done; 1) My partner slept in the lobby from about noon to 1445hrs; regular check-in is at 1500hrs, 2) We did not learn about having to request coffee or tea en suite; I learned about it the next AM when I saw another hotel guest in the lobby with coffee mugs, 3) the quirky goldfish element wasn't mentioned at check-in, so I asked twice about it the next day, 4) I asked the same front desk clerk who checked us in to have the burnt out light addressed by the bed...it wasn't. I asked someone else and it was fixed immediately. Another shift supervisor learned about our poor experience and sent up wine, chocolates and a handwritten note as a gesture of service recovery and for that we are thankful. At check-out I advised the same agent who checked us in nothing I asked of her was done, so she blamed the other areas. From doormen to housekeeping to maintenance, everyone else was great. Only check-in was brutal and front desk service was uneven. The rooms are small per building period, made smaller by the bold striping and the lack of natural light as the room faced another building, but extremely clean and the room in a location quiet. We were OK with Aveda toilettries, though dissappointed it wasn't L'Occitane. I suspect the Hotel Monanco views Hotwire bookings as the no frills/budget bookings and not \"found\" bookings (when in fact we paid more than if we booked directy; we just didn't know about the hotel). We are fond of boutique hotels (our favorite is in Palm Springs), but for us this one was a miss. In summary, if you are fortunate enough to discover Hotel Monaco on your own and not through a third party as we did, I expect your experience may be different than ours.

Rooms are decorated in that funky Kimpton style that you will either love or hate. Personally, I thought the decor was fun (leopard-print bathrobes!) and my room, though not huge, was more than adequate and very clean. It was also nice and cool despite the heat wave in Seattle at that time. I heard very little noise from the street below and the curtains actually closed all the way so that I could keep out unwanted light. Check-in and check-out were both easy, and on arrival I found a little \"welcome\" note from the staff in the room, along with a bottle of spring water and a bag of sweets from a local chocolate company - a nice touch. Breakfast at Sazerac was delicious and the staff were very friendly and efficient. There are some nice little touches like fancy trays of jam & butter to go with your croissant and interesting Asian-style teapots. It would have been helpful if they opened earlier than 7 am; each day I had to sit down as soon as they opened in order to have time to eat before my meetings. My only quibbles with the hotel were (1) they are not yet 100% non-smoking, and this was not obvious on their website; it might be worth calling them to confirm that you will have a non-smoking room, and (2) the hotel staff were not terribly knowledgeable about the downtown area when I asked for directions.

Since paying much less then rack, we were ok with paying top dollar parking rates. We brought our daughter, 12, and her freind, 13 on this trip. They had delivered (upon prior request) goldfish in bowls for them to enjoy over the weekend. Nice touch! The rooms are very cozy and beds equally comfortable. Kids loved the flatscreen TV. The next morning we had coffee in room, as well as more from the lobby area. We really enjoyed this service. We walked to Pike Place Sat. am and had breakfast at \"The Crumpet Shop\". Well liked by all. When we went to retrieve our car, the valet opened the door and called my husband by name...nice touch!. I noticed that they have \"kid packs\" available for children.

Also, the hotel has a wine reception between 5-6pm, which was really nice. I really was expecting less then perfect service having booked on priceline, but I must say, we were blown away by this place. Already planning our next trip back and will definatly stay here again without hesitation. This was one of our best hotel stays ever.

Well to start off I booked a suite and paid extra and then found that their website description is not what you get. A suite has more than a bedroom and a bathroom (standard hotel room). When I took my printed reservation down to the front desk and showed them that it said things like two TV, a couch, ect, the desk clerk told me \"oh, they mixed two suites into the same description on the Kimpton Website - sorry about that how about a free breakfast\". You got to be kidding me! Even Embassy Suits has a sitting room, bathroom and bedroom unlike what Kimpton calls \"a suite\". I was here for a 5 day stay and this was how they offer to correct false advertising? I send the Kimpton preferred guest website an email asking about the failure to provide a suite as advertised on their website (my reservation description) (also furnished a hard copy of the reservation printout (from their website) to the front desk manager on duty) and did not get any reply or solution. I also send an email after the trip (guest survey) and once again did not get any follow up via email or mail. So I guess that tell you how concerned they are about guest. The staff ranged from indifferent to not helpful. I asked the front desk if their was any good breakfast spots in the neighborhood hood and was told, no only the hotels. Gee I found one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle 1/2 a block away, how convenient that the hotel does not know they exist. We arrived late the first night (11 pm) and had to go inside and run down the bellman who busy chating on his cell phone to get any help with our bags. Prior to my arrival I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my 20th Anniversary as my other half is really picky so I wanted to make sure everything was good to go. I got a nice email back saying they would like to deliver a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to our room upon arrival to celebrate. I also told them we needed foam pillows. So upon arrival no champagne or strawberries, no foam pillows and we had a great room with a view of an alley and high rise building -nice! Now the good - you will not find a better housekeeping staff or a cleaner room than this property. We were very impressed that when we left each morning to go out shopping that they made up the room before we got back (even short trips of 2 hours or less). The beds were comfortable. Not so good - the AC-Heat control has a 4 x 4 inch screen that is bring green and will shine directly in your eyes all night. If you are light sensitive, you will have to tape something over the controls. This is not a 4 start hotel, it a very clean business hotel with super high rates.

Positives: Large bathroom (Mediterranean Suite) Comfortable bed & pillows Attentive housekeeping staff Negatives: AC unit malfunctioned throughout the stay Front desk disorganized. Missed 3 separate wakeup calls. Concierge was always busy and hard to get in touch with. Didn't provide much guidance on special requests. TV hard to use and iPod sound dock in suite non functioning. ---- I decided to book a Mediterranean Suite for my 3 night weekend stay after my 1st choice (where the rest of my party was) filled up. In comparison to the W, I spent about $45 more per night but had a larger (square footage) room with a great soaking tub (with whirlpool jets) and a nice shower. Before my stay, I had the hotel arrange a car service, the price $53 with tip was reasonable and the driver was waiting for me on arrival. Checkin was easy but the downside was that with a room that was picked for its 2 person jacuzi tub, I found no bath accessories (salts, bubble bath etc...) and didn't get any during the stay. The first night (got in around 12/1a) I checked in and had a voucher for a bottle of champagne (nice gesture) and the fish waiting in my room. First impression is that the room was huge but there was so much open space I felt that the room was almost too big. The TV was far away from the bed so it was a chore to change the channel. The iPod dock was also broken which was disappointing. In the morning on my way out I asked for someone at the desk to check the thermostat out (it said 65F but was around 74, which was about 2 degrees too warm) and try to cover its face for me at night (bright blue light kept me up). When I got back to the room that night, no one had done either. That was the 1st drop by the front desk. I called maintainence and someone came to look at the thermostat but he told me to play around with the settings until I was happy (why have a digital box if it won't work!?!??!?!) I asked for a wakeup call at 10am the next morning, that didn't happen. I called later for a 6pm nap wakeup call.... they forgot that. The 10am wakeup call the next morning, yep, it was forgotten.

The bed was large and luxurious, Internet (both wired and WIFI) available at no charge to guests and with a very good signal.

We had a Monaco King Room, and they have a program where you can adopt a goldfish for your stay. Our adoptive goldfish was named Belle. Belle was a charmer, very interactive for a fish, and we really missed her upon leaving. Check-In was fast and friendly, and after we had dropped off our bags we went back down and asked some directions from the front desk staff. They were very kind and gave us maps, suggestions, and directions to our specific query. The one little blip in our arrival was that we are Kimpton members and the specific little preferences that were supposed to be on tap for our room, were not in place. However, they later made up for it with a nice little fruit basket and mineral water. It is a beautifully done, elegant, smaller hotel, and I loved the reproduction Minoan frescoes, a la Knossos, in the reception area. There is definitely a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpersonal touch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The hotel is placed well, and we were able to walk to some nice downtown shopping areas and to the Pike Place Market, albeit nearly everything was closed by the time we made it down there. One negative, and it had nothing to do with the Hotel, were the swarms of homeless that approached one asking you to buy a 'paper'. Apparently Seattle deals with its homeless in a very humane manner and gives them identity badges and allows them to sell these newspapers. A unique approach to the problem, but it does get bothersome the fortieth time one is asked to 'buy a paper'. That and the rather seedy looking fellows lounging in a doorway, as we were getting near Pike Market, who were coveting my hub's camera - Seattle is beautiful architecturally so he was taking snaps like mad. However, I gave them my meanest - i.e. if looks could maim, ex-NYCer, ex-Chi-towner, ex-Miami, current LA Hollywood denizen glare and they backed off right quick. So, try not to look like a tourist in downtown Seattle, unless you are ready to thrash someone to a pulp if they try to jump you. Frankly, from my point of view, try not to look like a tourist anywhere! So, other than those two little blips, Seattle was fab, and the Hotel Monaco was AbFab! We had a nice large room, it was oddly shaped, but I do like things like that, and a huge window with a view up toward what I suppose are the hills. If one were of a voyeuristic bent, you could watch the life going on around one down on the street, and across the way in the residential buildings. The bathroom was large and spotless, with nice soft towels and L'Occitane products. There were some free sundries, and also a list of other sundries available for nominal prices. In the mini-bar were lots of choices, and these cute little stuffed goldfish that one can purchase. Yes, I got one and named her Belle, Too. In the closet were robes, camies and boxers in assorted sizes, and an umbrella that one could purchase, on the honour system. All in all, the items in the closet were a little on the pricey side - so I did not partake of any, but we got a good price on our room from my hubs corporate travel agency, so we ended up paying less by almost a c-note that we would have paid if we booked the room ourselves. The normal price of the room was comparable for others of the same class in the same area, but I liked the Monaco better because of the ambiance, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE! Oh, and the bed, and pillows, were EVER so comfortable. I might even consider buying one from the Kimpton website sometime in the future. I had a wonderful sleep. The decor was nice and bright, but it had a modern classical empire sort of vibe, as well. There was free wifi, a definite plus, and I got to see other guests walking their pets, which always makes me happy. Although, it did make me miss my kitties. Also, there is a little shop on the main floor for sodas, emergency things if you need them, and they have souvenirs, too. There is an exercise room downstairs, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to use it. Although, it did look nice and clean. The next morning my hub's niece, who lives in Seattle, met us for breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Sazerac. The food was very tasty, mid-priced, and the staff very attentive. When I asked if the breakfast potatoes had onions in them - I am allergic to onions - they went to check, and then later when I didn't get the turkey sausage I ordered and I enquired about it, they said they had substituted it with ham because the turkey sausage had onion in it - ham had been my second choice. The waitress had remembered, and YES, she got quite a good tip for her attention to detail. Our niece, who had never been to the hotel before, told us that she would be coming back to Sazerac with her friends. The decor of Sazerac was lovely with all these wonderful free form glass fixtures, for which Seattle is famous, on the ceiling. The only possible cons about our hotel experience would be that the three elevators could be a little slow, and that there are only ice machines on a few floors, and of those two were broken. None of these problems were deal-breakers. When we visit Seattle again, and we will be going back, we will be staying at the Monaco again if they are available. It will be our first choice. Next time, I will ask if they have any rooms that one can see DOWN the hill from. I'd like a harbour view the next time. However, I did love the hill view, with all the lights glowing in the night. We LOVED our stay at the Monaco because of the ambiance, the people, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE!

It was all very luxurious except that the bathroom sink was very slow-draining. You have turn-down service, fun colorful bathrobes and the NY Times in the morning. There is a coffee maker but the one in our room had a defect. It said \"pause & pour\" but when I lifted the coffee pot it leaked all over which means the filter basket was missing the mechanism. The service was excellent from the valet to the bellman to the front desk people. You do not park your car in their lot, the only choice you have is to use the valet. It is about $30/day charge for the parking lot which is added to your bill and of course you tip the people each time they get your car so we only took the car out once to go to the Space Needle Restaurant. We walked to Pike Place Market and other places in the area. Bring good walking shoes and be prepared for hills. There is an Hour of Indulgence in the lobby from 5 to 6 p.m. but I really feel the word \"indulgence\" should be removed and they should just call it Happy Hour. They had one red wine, one white wine, one type of soda and absolutely nothing to eat. No snack to go with the drinks. I asked a woman who was pouring drinks if there was anything like peanuts -- anything at all and she said \"no, but that sounds like a good idea\". I'm sure they have people ask all the time even though she acted like I was the first person who ever inquired. For such a fancy hotel, I was really surprised and wondered why they used the word \"indulgence\". I have stayed at Inn Suites hotels where they have a happy hour with drinks and popcorn so you would think a Kimpton hotel would have some kind of snack. This is a pet-friendly hotel which was so surprising to me. I guess it just seems too elegant for that but I will say it was very clean and I never got the slightest hint of pet odors.

I had to pull my bags out, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even offer to help.

The suite is essentially a very large room separated by a curtain. The sitting room has a couch and additional flat screen TV. Unless you're traveling with more than 2 people or want to spend a lot of time in your room, the standard room is more than adequate. Suite bath is pretty much the same as a regular room (they do have suites with jacuzzis that might be more elaborate). Hotel is only 11 floors so don't expect panoramic views. Furnishings are \"funky\" but tasteful. Rooms appear to be in good repair. Robes (with animal print) are standard. Large flat screen TVs with many, many channels are standard. Bathroom amenities (Aveda) are replenished daily. Bathrooms are modern with tile floors and granite counters. I've had mixed room service experiences. Twice, it was fast and food (pizza) was excellent. One morning breakfast was late and cold. The soft-boiled eggs were hard, which is good because they didn't provide a spoon. The attached restaurant is okay, but the one time we tried it service was very slow. Have heard that it's good for lunch/dinner but the menu wasn't that appealing to me so didn't try it. The concierge was helpful but was rarely seen before 9 or after 5. However, the front desk personnel were great. Wake up calls came promptly. There is free wireless and wired interet access as well as a computer in the lobby for those who didn't bring their own. There are some additional nice touches. First, they host a \"wine hour\" from 5-6 each evening. Wine is decent (and free) and they do refill your glass. It's a nice way to unwind and mingle with colleagues or even strangers. They are also very pet friendly -- actually seem to enjoy pets rather than merely \"accepting\" them. For example, this huge dog joined the wine hour and started to wander off into the restaurant. The staff didn't panic -- merely quietly alerted the owner who rectified the situation. The location is good -- walking distance to a lot of things. However, the hotel is on a San-Francisco type hill, so if you walk down to Pike Market, it's a VERY steep walk back up. The one nice thing about this hotel is that it caters to a variety of traveler types. We saw Packers' fans (in town for the NFL game), business people, tourists, etc. A nice mix with nice staff.

At many hotels, he would have been penalized for arriving a day late, but when he pointed out the mistake and change of rate to the front desk staff, she immediately changed the rate back without hesitation. The concierge was very helpful in recommending some great restaurants and an affordable spa. One thing to remember though is that he leaves at 6 every night. My room didn't have much of a view. My view was of the street in front of the hotel. The hotel is in a building shorter than the surrounding buildings. My colleague had a better view down a street. The room was not huge, but it was spacious. The bathroom was very spacious. Everything was extremely clean. The free high speed internet was reliable. The bed was comfortable, but I do not like feather pillows, and that was all they offered. The climate control worked very well. The hotel is decorated brightly. The large (32\"?) flat screen TV with many channels is a nice bonus. The room and hallway had a musty smell, but I got over that quickly. Aveda bath products are a nice touch. Turn down service is standard and does not have to be requested. They will deliver a pet goldfish to your room if requested. It was nice to come home to and wake up to an animal since I missed my dogs. My one suggestion for improvement is the workout room. It is very small. There is nothing worse than being in a cramped little space with a bunch of other people trying to work out. This room has one treadmill, 2 elliptical machines, 3 stationary bikes, 1 stairmaster, 2 benches and 1 set of free weights. The third day I went in, the 5 lb dumbells were gone.

I struggled up to my third floor suite, which was pretty dark (only one window in the room and that faces a building) and had stained carpet (large reddish stains... possible crime scene?). There was no room service menu and the ethernet cable in the room was broken and didn't work (there is wireless). The fitness center is not acceptable for a hotel in this price range and reputation. It's difficult to get there (only one elevator goes to the lower level and that isn't noted so I had to call for instructions as to how to get to the lower level). Once you find the fitness center, its odd arrangement has to be noted. Cardio equipment faces a mirror wall while the communal television is behind you. If you want to use the small televisions attached to the cardio equipment, you'll have to go back upstairs to the front desk to get headphones. The equipment isn't very impressive and the lone treadmill is \"out of order\". You can find better facilities at a Holiday Inn Express. The in-room spa treatments presented a lot of confusion. Several phone calls were required to confirm treatments and even then, one treatment was cancelled just minutes before its scheduled time. This is a nice service and one of the big benefits Kimpton offers, but the Monaco Seattle isn't handling this service well. Room service staff was great, but food was only so-so. Doesn't compare to other great Kimpton restaurants (the Cypress in Cupertino and the Palomar in San Francisco have excellent restaurants). In-room jacuzzi would have been great, but a ring of grime circled the tub. And once filled with water, a multitude of dirty \"floaters\" were in evidence. This was an OK stay.

The Monaco offers an easy walk to the waterfront, shopping and Pike Place Market. One point worth mention: if you are walking to the waterfront, do not walk down the street at the corner of the hotel - the sidewalk there is very steep downwards. Instead, walk down 4th street towards the Market, and head down to the waterfront a few blocks down - the sidewalks are not so steep and scary there. And while you are staying at the Monaco, do not miss going inside the Seattle Public Library across the street. It is an architectual masterpiece and definitely not your average \"library.\" Tours are also given daily. I've stayed at other Monaco hotels and thoroughly enjoyed this one, like the others.

The lobby was beautiful and the staff allowed us a generous 3pm checkout so we could relax before our overseas flight. The room was quiet and clean and everything worked. But we were surprised to see that the room was decorated hideously. The room we got did not, in any way shape or form resemble the beautifully designed rooms advertised on the hotels Web site. The pillows for the beds were left in the chairs and there was no bedspread. The wall paper was grey and white and very depressing. In SF, I loved the Monaco's whimsical colorful style but there was no color or design in this room. Here, I felt they had really misrepresented their rooms which were dull and boring. For me a nice decor helps make me feel at home and cheers me up and this room didnt do the trick. I actually factor in decor when I book a room and sure, the photos they advertised are usually a bit more polished than the reality but at the Monaco Seattle, it was a pure misreprentation of the decor advertised. At the San Francisco Monaco, there was a lovely spa with a sauna and big hot tub. Here in Seattle, we paid 100 dollars more than SF and there was no spa at all. Why was it so much more? Finally, the room service menu did not include any vegetarian dishes except pizza. It seems like a no brainer to consider vegetarians when you make a room service menu. If you can include dogs, why not cover about the 10 percent of the population that doesnt eat meat. We were very disappointed with the Monaco Seattle.

I made a couple specific requests by email prior to our stay, and the staff always returned my emails promptly, ready to assist. We splurged and stayed in the Mediterrean Suite, which was wonderful. There was an emormous jet tub, and the room was spacious, very comfortable, and clean. The free internet access was also a plus. All other Seattle hotels I've been to have a fee. I was blown away by the friendly and competent staff at Hotel Monaco. Everyone from the front desk staff to the concierge to the housekeeping staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The only downside of our stay was that our hotel room smelled a bit of ciagrette smoke. I had specifically requested a nonsmoking room. When I called the front desk, they assured us that we were on a nonsmoking floor, but that they'd be happy to move us to another room immedietly if we were not happy. Because we so enjoyed our unique suite, we decided to stay rather than move to a smaller room. We were more irritated by the guests who'd stayed before us and smoked in a nonsmoking room than we were with the hotel, which made efforts to remedy the situation. Following our stay, I received a thoughtful and personal email from one of their staff members apologizing for the occurence and guaranteeing that the problem would be discussed with housekeeping in an effort to more thoroughly clean rooms of smoke in the future. I was extremely impressed with this timely response, especially because I'd never made a formal complaint about the room, I had just mentioned it briefly. We were offered a discount on our next stay because of the \"inconvience,\" but even without a discount, I would make Hotel Monaco my #1 hotel choice in Seattle.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brush Prairie, Washington", "Title": "\u201cHmmmmm what to say\u201d", "Author": "hipmamatravels", "ReviewID": "UR4163693", "Content": "I had really high hopes for the Hotel Monaco when we chose it as our base for a girlfriend's shopping trip to Seattle. But after our stay, I would say that given the competition in Seattle, it was just okay. The hotel has a lot of nice features but little things that detract: The bedding is super soft and luxurious with down comforters and pillows. But the mattress is a rock hard standard hotel bed that kept me awake both nights. The furnishings are nice and the colors and patterns fun but the chair had a rip in it and the wall paper was peeling. We stayed in room 815 and there was a noise like a fog horn that vibrated through the walls off and on through our stay. My guess is it's the water pipes but it was really annoying. On waking the first morning we found that we had two packages of decaf instead of regular coffee. It took them 30 minutes to send up coffee and then they showed up with just one package. This is coffee town USA and you get one little package and 3 tiny dried creamers? There was supposed to be coffee service in the lobby but we never saw any. It must be cleared really early. It's gone by 10AM. The wine reception is from 5-6 and boy you better get there on time because if you walk in at 5:50 like we did you get a look from the manager like you are trying to scope a 2nd glass. That and the food was a plate of goldfish crackers. Classy. Friday night the restaurant and bar were closed by 4pm for a private party. That was where we planned to eat since we'd heard so much about the fun bar. It was another bummer to add to the rest. All over the hotel are posters that say things like the hotel is all about \"you\" and your comfort etc. But we felt neither catered to or comfortable. No one on staff ever asked us how we were doing or even said hello. We'll be looking elsewhere for our next visit.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, CA", "Title": "\u201cMonte Carlo Suite\u201d", "Author": "SPCTCC", "ReviewID": "UR4126156", "Content": "Wow -- from the moment you enter the spacious suite and find yourself smiling at the bright colorful draperies and linens, comfortable furnishings and wonderful touches with Aveda products, mint chocolates and leopard print robes -- to the peace and quiet the room and its placement afford -- you know that you have chosen well.

Before we arrived I was able to email with a reservationists who answered many questions and provided me local services for baby rental gear and sitter services. I had multiple email transactions and each one was responded in a professional friendly manner. Of course it's hard to do everything perfect. I had trouble using their one-touch phone buttons to connect to either the concierge or room service as the phone would just receive a busy signal without re-routing the call to the front desk, and after I called the front desk directly they offered to have room service call and that never happened. Overall the experience and people were friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed first walking into the colorful room and having their own special jazz CD playing (nice touch).

Room: The Mediterranean Suite is quite large, equipped with a two-person Jacuzzi tub and small stand up glass-enclosed shower. The room had no view but we did not care. The room was clean except for a small throw blanket that adorned the foot of the bed, which we took off. It was tastefully decorated and the walls were striped.

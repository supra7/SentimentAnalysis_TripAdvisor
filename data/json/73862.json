It is located at 1-17, close to the 101, so easy to get places. The pool is great, there is also a hot tub and a 1 1/2 foot deep cold pool Breakfast runs from 7-9am, it is continental, but more than just bread and a toaster. I arrived too early for the 3pm check-in and was met at the front desk by Ryan who allowed me to check in early and gave me a cookie and some bottled water. He is always smiling, very helpful, and very knowledgeable about how to get places and what to find there. The rooms are modern, comfortable, and clean, big flat screen TVs, fridge, and microwave. I have a ground floor which i like for loading in luggage etc. Maintenance guys are always working around the property keeping it nice. It is about to be re-paved. There is nothing around here to walk to except for a 7-11. Unlike other hotels, there is not coffee available except as breakfast, but they will give you extra coffee for your room. Today I found out that the hotel across the street has a Starbucks. I kind of wish that I had known that 10 days ago, but it is good to know now. The exercise room could use some additions, there is a bike, 2 treadmills, and a climber. No weights at all. This place is about half-way between Glendale and Scottsdale, both places of which I have been 3 times, so it is convenient. There have been lots of kids in the pool on certain days. The weather has been around 90 degrees. Great WiFi, no code to put in.

As always, the folks at the front desk were super nice at check-in and once I got into my room and got situated, only then did I look out the window to see that I was overlooking the pool. It was tempting, in the 111 degree heat, to go outside and lounge around with a few other brave souls but I had work to do, unfortunately. I went back out to the car to head downtown to my assignment and was surprised to have someone calling out to me from the sidewalk asking if I could help them out.. with some cash.. That made me feel a bit uneasy as it's never happened before, not even in NYC or Chicago or some other big urban area where one might expect it. But, he seemed nice enough and not threatening what so ever. I never encountered anything like this again, not even in downtown Phoenix walking around by myself at night. It was a once-in-a-million thing and I just mention it because it was so surprising. It could have happened in Omaha or Miami or Fargo or literally anywhere and doesn't reflect anything negative about Phoenix. There are people in need in every city in this country and this gentleman was just that, a gentleman. The breakfast was good here with a couple of local flavors and twists on the usual fare, which was a nice change from the standard spread. They had a lot to choose from and everything was clean, well-stocked, and organized; nice work. The room itself was as clean as it gets and was well-stocked and equiped and everything worked perfectly. The bed was also perfect.

We had a long flight from St. Louis to LA, then to Phoenix. It was a tiring day because we have to drive 3 hours to St. Louis, then a four-hour flight to LA then another nearly hour-long flight to Phoenix. When we arrived in Phoenix, one of our bags was missing, so we had to wait to deal with that, then wait for a rental car. We finally arrived at the hotel after 10 PM, which would be midnight Central Time, our key did not work, had to go to the office and get another one. While waiting outside for my husband I noticed the paint was chipping on the building and it was very dated. It was not a good first impression. Then we entered the room and smelled strongly of smoke--it was a non-smoking room. I was not pleased with that at all. Really, I only noticed the smell the first night. After the first night, things were better. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. They had our bag from the airport the next morning. My daughter loved this hotel, especially the large pool and hot tub. The pool area is very nice, and there is a covered patio to eat breakfast outside. The free breakfast is small, they have yogurt, fruit, cereal and make you own waffles. It got very crowded in there each day. The beds were small, but comfortable.

We arrived very late on a Friday and wanted somewhere to stay that was a short distance from the airport, but located on I17 because of our travel plans for the next day. After reading the reviews on here I decided that this would be the perfect fit for what I needed. I couldn't have been more WRONG. Because of flight times and picking up the rental car we didn't arrive until very early Saturday am. The first thing I notice is the security guard patroling the parking lot and how run down the outside looked. I think someone in a previous post mentioned skid row. This, in my opinion fits that description. While checking in the TV is blaring a movie. While standing there, I heard the F word (several times) coming from the TV. I glanced at it and back at the clerk. She looks at me and says that she doesn't know what movie this is, but that it's not appropriate to be watching (You think?) and turns the volume down. Thankfully my daughter was in the car with my husband or I would have said something. I get all the stuff filled out and the clerk begins explaining where our rooms are located. Since she didn't mention where the elevators were located (it's a 2 story hotel) I asked where they were. She informed me they don't have any. Seriously? I couldn't believe it. I thought that because of the Americans with Disabilites act that an elevator was a must. The only reason it was a big deal was that we had 2 huge suitcases and the idea of having to take them up steps as tired as we were wasn't appealing. I reminded myself that we most likely got the last room available and to suck it up. Then the hunt for the room began. What a huge mess. They have three seperate buildings and none are clearly marked as to which rooms are where. My daughter and I literally walked around for 5 minutes before the security guard found us and pointed us in the general vicinity of our room. Even he wasn't really clear where our room was. What good is a security guard if he doesn't even know where all the rooms are located? So, we find the room and then I decide I really need a bottle of water, but I don't have the right change for the machine. I head to the lobby to get change. Once in the lobby, I notice that the TV volume is back up to blaring on the same movie that was \"inappropriate\" just a few minutes ago. The room was OK and served our purpose of needing some where to sleep for a few hours before continuing on our journey. I didn't see any mold or bugs and the room appeared to be clean. The hotel is located right off of the freeway and there were several chain restaurants at the next exit for food. Nothing right near the hotel. They do offer a light breakfast, which we opted not to partake in so I can't comment on that. We also didn't hear any of the freeway traffic, but that could be because of our being tired. The price was OK for what we got. All the entrances are from the outside and depending on which side of the motel you get placed on, you may not be able to see your car out your window. Because we had a rental car we like to keep an eye on it for obvious reasons. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. All I can say is buyer beware.

The next morning when I insisted that no one else could be put in that room until the door was fixed, the maintenence man dismissively said \"they're all like that.\" Also, when we arrived they wouldn't honor the coupon price because they said it \"was a holiday\" - even though it was early/mid December and the coupon was valid December 1 through February.

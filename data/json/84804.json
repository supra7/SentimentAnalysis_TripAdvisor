From the condition of the unit we were in, i think it's the style that makes the place look dated - peach and sea foam green painted walls (appeared freshly painted too), rattan furniture, tropical print cushions and curtains, dining table with glass table top. Everything was clean and for the most part in good working order (issue with light in master bedroom). The grounds and the pools are clean too. There are many activities on the grounds to enjoy like basketball, tennis, volley ball, putting green, shuffle board. There's also a game room. We had an end unit in the Saturn building on the 3rd floor. There are no elevators. This wasn't an issue for us but could be for some folks. However, what was an issue is the vaulted ceilings in the master bedroom with the 6 windows on the high part of the wall. There are no blinds or curtains. It wasn't a problem for me, but for my husband, it was an issue. He was up at sunrise every morning. If you are headed to the Disney's Animal Kingdom - do not make right onto Route 192. Instead, at the light, go straight and that road takes you there without the 192 traffic mess. Of course, check out mapquest before you do just in case I don't recall a turn or two.

That being said, I stayed at a time when landscaping and construction werebeing done around the parking areas, and unfortunately, much of the work was being done at night! This meant that two of the five nights spent at Orbit One were very noisy which didn't allow for very much sleep. When this was brought to the attention of guest services, it wasn't met with very much empathy or understanding, which left a bit of a damper on my stay. However, for one of the more popular places to stay in the area, the value was fantastic and we were very close to several restaurants, shops, and all the major theme parks.

Our one complaint...... Is what happens in most older condo's ( built early 80's) WALLS ARE PAPER THIN ! I mean you hear everything ! From TV's next door to if you unlucky enough to be under someone who moves furniture at night....We had someone move in our last night above us and OH MY ! They were unreal. It sounded like thunder for several hours until they got tired and went to bed at 1 am..... On Site Security 24 hours also but we never called...If we had to stay longer we sure would have. Some people only think about themselves and car little about others. We checked out the next day and honestly , if we had to stay longer ....It would have been very unpleasant because every time they move a chair it sounds like thunder below. Be advised the walls are THIN , THIN ! We could hear the TV next door clear enough to know what they were watching Granted we paid less than $300.00 a week so hard to complain....BUT WOW , LOUD!

You will be charged even if your call dosen't connect, I think it something like .87cents per call.

Let me first say that the night I got there I fell terribly sick, sinus infection, strep throat,fever, horrible cough which flared up my asthma, etc the whole works.. I was MISERABLE! staying in a condo was so much better because it felt like I was \"home\" there is nothing worse then being sick away from home.. that wasn't the case here because it's set up like an apartment I felt very comfortable there, and the first 5 days of my 11 day stay was spent totally sick in bed and I didn't even leave the condo once..So I really grew to call that place home. I loved that there was the full kitchen there My hubby was able to go to the grocery store and we stalked up on orange juice, tea, and soup since that was I all could pretty much eat :( but regardless of being miserable like i said if I had to be sick on vacation I'm glad it was here. if we had stayed in a regular hotel I'd have been forced to get dressed and go out to eat feeling miserable.. the HUGE AWESOME JETTED tub also came in super handy!!! with my cough and wheezing and stuff I'd hop in that tub and make it nice and steamy and it would clear me right up!! I pretty much lived in that tub and and in bed- well finally I felt human again on the 5th day and was able to explore the grounds a bit! we went and took a dip in the pool which is heated and was SO nice! they had a volley ball net, and another pool with a two little slides , lots of amenities! they also had some basic Continental breakfast stuff during the week day which we only ate from once it was just donuts, mini muffins. coffee and juice. but it was still nice! The condos themselves all come equipped with a washer and dryer which was really nice so we knew that before hand and were able to pack lighter since we knew we could wash that came in super handy too! I'll forewarn you it does take a while for the clothes to wash and dry but it does the job. also the washer spins reallllllly slow I was wondering if it could even possibly get clean going that slow but it did! here is what they had for toiletries so you know what to bring 2 bars of hand or body soap, two little tiny packets of tooth paste, if you are staying more than one night you'll need extra tooth paste, trash bags (we had enough for our whole stay), dish soap, dishwasher packet, we did run out of that so you may need to be prepared to buy extra dishwasher detergent if you have those tablets at home I'd maybe bring a few their small and then you wont have to buy any while there, it came with one box of laundry detergent, we ended up doing three loads while there but luckily I did bring two single packets of laundry detergent from home so I didn't have to buy extra while there. and that was it. so you'll need to bring your own shampoo, lotions, conditioner, body wash, etc because those things are not provided. and be prepared to possibly need more dishwasher tablets and more laundry detergent if you'll be running the dishwasher and washer and dryer often- In the kitchen everything was there that I could have possibly needed , baking sheets, pots, pans, plenty of dishes, etc, there is a toaster, microwave, coffee pot, tea kettle, and a full size fridge. the freezer is a bit small but it was sufficient. bed was pretty comfy, I love the enclosed patio that comes with all the rooms it was nice because you were outside but the screen prevented any bugs from getting in and there was a fan out on the patio too! there isn't much to complain about but there were a few minor things that would have made this place an A+ rather than just an A 1.)they charged a ridiculous amount for internet we have smart phones so we got by with just using that 2.)the living room furniture is more like patio furniture so it's not to comfy- the better TV is in the living room but we chose to watch TV in the bedroom most of the time when we did because the bed was more comfy 3.) I do with they would supply more toiletries and a little more dishwasher detergent and laundry soap with no additional costs- next time I'll just bring these things from home though so it wont be an issue 4.)I wish they had some sort of an elevator even though it's only 3 floors. it did get tiresome dragging the luggage and groceries up those stairs next time I'll request ground floor and that wont be an issue 5.) you had to pay for house keeping services- they do exchange your towels for you and bring new ones but no vacuuming, sweeping, or making of the beds unless you want to pay that would be it for any sort of complaints and thats not enough to keep me away I really liked this place a lot and would definitely stay again! like I said it felt like a home away from home! the location was great every other time we have stayed in Orlando we stayed over off of I drive by sea world.. But this area was nice because it had a TON of resteraunts all right there to choose from, there was sizzler, bob evans, perkins, i hop, mcdonalds, and just so many the list is endless on that main street. We found two FANTASTIC resteraunts we fell in love with down the street one was bahama breeze and the other was houlihans great food at both places. there was lots of discount gift stores right there too with in walking distance. Word of advice to folks there are a lot of \"fake people\" trying to buy and sell used Disney tickets DO NOT buy from them! they are fake! everything in Disney is based off finger prints.. those tickets are NOT legit! there is a person who sells tickets in the lobby here and I even wondered about them... I didn't buy any but the prices didn't seem right. So we just stuck with buying our tickets directly from Disney. You can however get a discount on tickets if your military or AAA we learned this after it was too late you can also get free parking with AAA- the discount wasn't a ton I think it was only a few $'s savings but next time I will go with them since savings is savings :) We only got one phone call about doing a time share tour they weren't pushy and we declined because we had plans the next morning they were polite and said ok and that was that- if we had had the time we probably would have done the tour though just for the incentive and for the fact we'd like to come back here again- Well that All I can think of!

Check in is easy and wonderfull. We arrived VERY early and they made great efforts to get us checked in early. Honestly we showed up around 10am with a 3pm check in. They got us checked in within an hour.....which was not only EXCELLENT, but gave us a little time to check out the area and find grocery stores and restuarants. Also they listened to our request to be near the pool for the kids and we were directly next to it. Durning the day we spent most of our time at Disney, but it was really nice to come home from the hot long days to our air-conditioned villa. And it is not very far from all the attractions. Once you learn the Florida Hwy's (which are pretty confusing), you can get to Disney in about 10 min. Ok, now for the rooms. Everything was as described. The master had a big comfortable bed (no cheap mattresses here), but I can't remember if it was a queen or king....king I think. The other room had two twin beds. The best part is that the rooms are seperated by two bathrooms....giving parents a little space and privacy. Also there is a washer/dryer unit in the villa. The units come fully furnished, dishes, silverware, dishwasher, tv's in both rooms and the living room. The patio area is also screened in to prevent mosqitos & other insects, of which there are too many! The resort although small still had plenty of amenities, they have a small game room, basketball courts, a good size pool with 2 slides, and more. Everyone was friendly and happy to help. I highly recommend this place as a great alternative to HUGE resorts where no one will know or remember your name. But keep in mind it is not a 5 star resort.....and you will be more than happy with what you get for the money here. If I go back to Disney, I will definitely stay here again!", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cnice property\u201d", "Author": "ualcid", "ReviewID": "UR121437464", "Content": "very comfortable and large unit.

We purchased our tickets from Disney Parks and sold them to local vendors for the days that we didn't use. It is worth it to purchase extra b/c you will get it back from the locals.

I remembered it being outdated, under repair but otherwise ok. Needless to say, I wasn't exactly excited this trip when it got right down to the wire and Orbit One was the best option for the price. I think I even covered my eyes when I was clicking on \"confirm reservation\" lol It did have the four things we were looking for though #1) Close to Disney #2) Full Kitchen #3) Washer/ Dryer #4) at least 2 bedrooms. I had looked on trip advisor and saw that the newer pics and reviews were better than they were in 2004 too. We stayed during spring break with our three children ages 6,9 and 11. When we arrived check-in was quick and easy. The staff was super nice/helpful, the rooms were very clean...and had been updated since our last trip. Staff/Service: We did have a problem with our room key when we first got there. Our room was located just across from the office, so my husband went to let them know while the girls and I waited at the room door. The maintainence staff actually got to our room and fixed the problem within seconds..my husband had not even made it all the way back to the room before it was fixed. About half way through the trip we needed extra towels. We were returning to our room around 8 or 9 in the evening. I never imagined we would get towels that night, but called to let them know we needed some the next day. Again, within 5 minutes someone was at our room with a bag of towels, wash clothes, etc. So, as far as the staff/service goes I have to give them an A+. The Room: I posted pics. You can see for yourself how nice the rooms are. Everything was clean...even the floors, baseboards, etc. The kitchen was well stocked. *the best* thing about the room (and the reason we decided to go ahead and book this time) was the HUGE masterbedroom tub. After a day at the parks it is just wonderful. The pics really do not do the size justice. The beds were comfortable. The Pool: The main pool has 2 slides and is heated. The girls had fun playing at the pool. During our stay, it seemed to be mainly retired people there. Which for the kids meant no waiting in line at the slides and a giant pool to themselves mostly. On Thursday afternoon they had an \"ice-cream social\" ..... which was the fancy way of saying \"free ice-cream sitting on the table if you want it\" .... but ice-cream is ice-cream and the kids loved it. The hot tub was under repairs the entire week, but I will get to that in a sec. *** If you do have children, I highly recommend getting the pass from the office to go to the pool at Liki-Tiki at least once. They have a ton of stuff going on, lots of slides, music, contests, etc. Liki-tiki pool=FUN, exciting Orbit One=relaxing, enjoyable. The good thing is you have access to both. Staying in the Neptune building: the down side, the master bedroom faces highway 192 and since you have a big bay window instead of a solid wall, it doesn't provide much sound insulation. During that weekend, an ambulance was stationed at the gas station just outside our window and went on exactly 11 calls between 2 and 6 in the morning. Quite a few cars were squealing out and revving up engines in the wee hours of the morning. I figured it was safe to assume it wasn't the tourists in mini-vans, lol. We figured it was younger kids getting off the late shift at local businesses. It seemed to calm down during the week days. The other buildings do not appear to have bedrooms facing main roads..so you may want to try for one of their other buildings. Repairs: Like I said, the hot tub was under repair the entire week. We only got to use it the first day. It should be fine for any future stays. Here is the part where I got a little un-nerved though. Our room was on the third floor (no elevator x 5 people= many trips up/down the stairs to unload the car) We have no problem using stairs, but after we got everything unpacked and into drawers my oldest daughter went to get info about Liki-Tiki from the office. When she got back she said \"here mom, they said they forgot to give you this\" It was a letter stating that the power would be off that Tuesday from 9 am to 7pm due to switching out an electrical panel in our building. I was beyond mad, mainly because we chose to stay there because we brought food with us that needed to be in the fridge. I went back to the office ( this is when they handed me another letter they had forgot to give me about the hot tub being down) They were willing to move us to a different building ...after talking it over with my husband we decided not to ( just because we would have to pack everything back up, put it back in the car and unload it again and with our luck it would be on the 3rd floor again. We would just make plans to be gone that entire day and hope for the best with the food) The office was kind enough to give us 2 bags of ice to help keep it cool in the ice chest ....yes, there is a little sarcasm in my tone there. My only thought on this is: why would they just not put people in that building? The did not appear to be booked up and would have been able to relocate us. So why put us there to start with??? BUT, now the electrical panel is new..so, I think it was a one time thing that happened and shouldn't happen in the near future again. Location to Disney: Orbit One is located on \"Entry Point Blvd\" ... which turn into \"Sherberth\" across the intersection. You literally go across the intersetion and with in a half mile are on Disney property. It comes out right at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Which makes it easy to find your way back from the parks. Just follow the signs to Animal Kingdom Lodge and when you see it make a left , cross the intersection and you are back at Orbit One. Hardly no traffic to deal with. Overall: Would we stay again? Not sure, it depends on what our needs are. If you want a comfortable, clean place, close to Disney and you plan on just using it as a \"base\" to sleep (as long as you aren't in the Neptune building), eat and maybe swim a bit......its perfect. If you want a resort with activites to spend the time at on days when you aren't going to a park...not so much.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utica, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "tc2011", "ReviewID": "UR98378998", "Content": "We didn't know what to expect and were pleasently surprised.

We booked online thus we had no idea what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived very late (1:30 am) and had no trouble getting our room keys from the security guard. We stayed in the Apollo complex which was near all the amenities. The condo was very bright, clean, and spacious. In fact, we couldn't get over how clean it smelled. The in suite laundry facilities were a real bonus, as was the dish washer. The pools were smaller than we imagined but turned out to be the perfect size for us. They were never busy (and were warm) so we had lots of fun using them and did not have to deal with crowds. This was important to us after a long day at the Disney Parks. My 12 year old son was thrilled that they had a basketball court (half-court only) and we also took some time to play tennis. The grounds were under construction so when we first arrive, the outside looked a bit bleak. However, during our two week stay we saw the place transform as the new sprinklers and lawn were installed. We heard that the next plan is to paint the outside of the buildings. This will give it a real facelift. What we liked most is that it was spacious and quiet. After spending the day at the Disney Parks we enjoyed the quietness of this condo. It is not a fancy resort so if that is what you are looking for this is not the place to stay, but, it is close to everything and has everything you need for a reasonable price. We did find the floors turned our feet black as another reviewer mentioned. I even took the time to wash the floors and they still turned our feet black. I think it was due to the fine dirt in the grounds due to the construction getting dragged in from our shoes. It was no big deal to us. We wore socks or shoes in the condo. Next time, I would bring slippers. The staff was always friendly and helpful. We had a few minor problems such as a leaking value on the toilet and a burned out light bulb which they fixed immediately. They even dropped off clean towels without us requesting them.

The photos in the website really depict what the room looks like. - The AC was already on, and the room was already cooled as soon as we arrive. (and temp was in the high 90s F when were there) - We did not hear any noises from our neighboors. so I'm guessing the walls are thick enough. Hurray! 3. The amnities -Front Office, breakfast room and gym are located in the main building, and they open at 8am. - WIFI is NOT free. $30 for 7 days, - I wish the gym opens earlier so I could get my workout early in the morning (before the family wakes up), but for my 1st day the nice security man let me in the gym at 6am. - The kiddie pool was perfect for my 2 year old nephew. 4. Security - Its a gated resort, and gate always had a security guard at night, I felt safe that my car will not be vandalised, or get something stolen. But the neighborhood itself seems safe to walk about at night. 5. Con - The only thing i can find wrong was that the grounds was under upgrade/repair/renovation while were we there (because it was on the low seasons). So the grounds were not in their best form. 6. Extra bonus - There's free breakfast and coffee in the main office every weekdays (M-F). Nothing big, but since we had our own kitchen, i didnt get to taste their breaky. - For an extra $5, your whole party can use thier sister resort's waterpark. Again, a nice bonus if you came with lots of kids, but we didnt use since this place had 2 pools. - Free Parking - No Pets allowed. 7. Overall - I would stay here again.

The staff was very friendly and mostly accommodating. The actual unit was a bit dated, but so has most of the other time shares we have stayed in, it was however very clean. In our second week they replaced all of our sheets with some beautiful new contemporary white duvet sets (we wondered why these weren't used in the first week).

I used the gym everyday and some days I would see no one and other days there would be a line up with no system to deal with it.

We saw no ants. Bottom line, if you don't like insects, don't vacation in the south! Our room was clean, and all was as expected, if not better. Especially considering the price we paid for our stay ($67.00 per night)! In fact, we've stayed at the Westin resort complex with friends before, and the rooms were laid out practically identical! Our problems were few, were not major, and consisted of: the light in the childrens room, which was insufficient. There was only a single lamp, and it's not enough light for a room, and with the \"energy efficient\" type lighting, you had to wait 10 minutes after turning it on to see anything. The other problem was the dryer duct must have had a birds nest in it, as after 3 hours of run-time, clothes were still wet/damp. But- you don't get your own washer/dryer in most hotels, so just having one in the room was a plus. The only other thing I consider a problem was that they wanted to charge us $30 for a week of wireless internet access. Most hotels these days are FREE. Both bedrooms had their own TV and the living room had a nice large flat-screen and comfortable furniture in good condition. The cable line up was adequate, considering we weren't on vacation to watch TV. The hot tub by the pool was nicely hot, and the large pool with two slides was warm enough to swim. We felt secure because a guard was on duty 24 hours a day, even though the neighborhood seemed nice enough not to need one. The desk help was polite and helpful. The only thing that put me off is that it is a time share setup, and I despise the time share business, having witnessed dozens of them go bust in Myrtle Beach where I'm from and saw many tourists lose thousands of dollars of their hard earned money on them. I thank my lucky stars that I booked the place as a hotel and was not forced to waste an hour of my life on a time share tour! Skip the \"free\" breakfast if you have any sort of appetite. It's micro-sized muffins, coffee, and juice. There are dozens of places to eat within walking distance, including a Golden Corral. One of my grandkids got a cough, and Walgreens is about 1 mile away. Dunkin' Donuts is also very nearby, but don't expect the help there to speak English as a primary language. Dunkin Donuts employees and manager neither know what the \"Orlando kids eat free\" card is, even though they are advertised as participants, and they'll just hand your card back to you with your change without giving you any discount. You might get away with giving them exact change and refusing to pay a penny more, but they had my money and left me with no recourse. When I asked for a refund they just took the next customer in line and pushed me aside. No more Dunkin Donuts for me! RUDE! Disney Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, and Epcot are a very short distance across the highway from Orbit One. Set your GPS to take you to Animal Kingdom. Setting my Garmin GPS to Magic Kingdom took me an extra 8 miles or so unnecessarily, and all three entrances are in the same place. The route to Animal Kingdom was much shorter. We enjoyed all the Disney parks, with the exception that they encourage line-cutting. If you visit, you'll see what I'm talking about. They tell you to step around the people in front of you if they don't hear the \"command\" to move up tighter. Disney herds you through rides like cattle. The rides are enjoyable, but this practice kind of put me off. We got 'tard seats in \"It's a bugs life\" (stationary seats for people who get disturbed easily by motion) because they allowed too many people into the attraction at once.

After all, we were there for Disney! Regarding location, I don't know how you can get any better! You just make a left out of the parking lot, go through the light at 195 down this little side road (Sherberth) and within minutes you are at Animal Kingdom.

The rest of the week we just took 2 strollers and pushed them through and it was so much better. The villas themselves were AWESOME. Our kids had their own room w/ their own bathroom and we had a HUGE room w/ a king size bed and an enormous jacuzzi (we could all fit in that thing!). The kitchen was well stocked w/ plates, cups, mugs, frying pans, utensils, even tupperware type containers to store leftovers in. We made our own breakfasts and brought light lunches to the parks each day (bring a softsided lunchbox w/ drinks and snacks). We even packed sandwiches for the kids-- why pay huge prices for kids who just want PB&J anyhow? Then we ordered food for ourselves for lunch and ate at the parks for dinner, or came back to the room for ziti, tacos, hot dogs, etc. Plus the villas are so quiet (we never heard anyone in our block) and the kids slept just fine every night. My only complaint was that the window in their room didn't have black-out curtains so the sun shone in early in the morning and they got up (much too early for our liking). The bedding was thick and heavy (not threadbare or worn), the couches were ok, and our mattress was firm. All the negative comments I had seen about decor and paint were ridiculous. I mean, I'd never decorate my own home in bold flowery prints, but hey, we were in Florida not in my own home. The place was so comfortable, there were THREE tvs, a huge refrig, microwave, stove, etc. Gimme a break! We stayed in the Mercury building, second floor, just for reference. Now there were a few issues when we were there. Our upstairs neighbors had a leaky valve in their plumbing, so we woke up one morning to a soaked countertop in our bathroom. Within 15 minutes maintenance was there to fix the problem and we didn't have an issue with it for the rest of the week. Then toward the end of the week the resort had a water main break. They had to turn off the water (we had been at Disney all day), then when we got back and saw that our water was off we called the main office and Chris (one of the staff) ran around for nearly an hour trying to find a villa we could either move to, or just use to shower in. He gave us keys to the new villa but then 1/2 hr later our water was back on and we were happy as clams. At first it seemed like it was going to be a big deal but it turned out to be just fine. I really appreciated Chris' efforts. Another great feature was the washer/dryer. We went home w/ all clean clothes and only had to pack half of what we normally would. Just run down the road (less than a mile) to the Marketplace Winn-Dixie or Super Target and stock up on food and supplies. Do NOT go to the little stores that say \"supermarket\"-- everything at those places is double or triple their normal prices, like buying groceries at a gas station convenience store. One thing we did not like was the tile on the floors that made the kids' socks pretty dirty but at least I could chuck them into the washer and have clean ones by the next day. Also to note, we stayed here w/ an RCI certificate that cost us less than $200 for the entire week (and included Wi-Fi, which we used). This was a very special rate as it was a gift, and therefore allowed us to overlook the little issues that happened during our stay. Because where else could we stay that offered this much for this little? We'll definitely be making a return trip here next year. Oh, and they were updating and painting a bunch of other villas while we were there, so there's obvious upkeep and upgrading of the rooms. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

We specifically asked to be in a quiet section which for the most part it was, but several mornings the construction workers were parked right outside our unit (we were on the end) and walking right by our patio and windows often so we kept the blinds closed on those days. They get there early too. One morning we awoke to 4 dump trucks, several other utility trucks and workers installing meters right infront of our patio and bedroom area. They cut the electricity off for a few hours and did not notify anyone including the office, that they were doing so. That was really the only major problem we had during our stay.

It has everything you need to be comfortable. Super location and very close to anywhere you want to go.

With traffic, it took us about a half hour to travel to and get parked at Universal. Orbit One was opened in '83, so it's not new but has been upgraded. If you look hard enough it shows a little aging, but we really liked it anyway(I show a lil aging too,lol). If you need 5 star accomodations, go elsewhere. I rank it as a strong 3 star. It has a guarded entry gate(nice guys but not staffed at night tho) and the grounds are surrounded by a 6' fence. It has two nice pools,outdoor activities like dual tennis courts,shuffleboard, a basketball net, a raquetball court and bbq's(briquet style) and the grounds are very nice. The staff were cordial and attentive. The villas are well appointed with everything you need to survive, including a blender. The only thing my daughter noticed was there is no hairdryer in the main bathroom but there is a wall mounted type in the master bath suite,so bring an extra. Other than that it's fully equipped including newer appliances. We were very comfortable there and we will definately stay there again. We stayed in the \"Saturn\" building. Each building is named after planets. Somebody else here mentioned the Neptune building balconies faced into the Shoneys parking lot and they weren't happy there. I can say that I don't blame them. That is the only building there that had an objectionable view. The business center there had only 2 pc's, but you must pay a daily rate of $8 or a weekly rate, I can't remember it ,but it was the best choice. Or...you can do as we did, just go down to the pc and see if it will work for you because if a previous user signs on but didn't sign off...your in. At no added expense to them either btw. We found that most of the time one or both the pc's were left like that, So if it's not that important to you, save your money and take your chances.

They have DVD players, not VHS. All the appliances and plumbing looked new and we had no problems. We didn't use the sofa bed. We rented a pack n play for the week, and my older son slept on the cushion from the love seat on the floor. The beds were very comfortable and we slept great. The kids loved this place. They had room to run around and play, rather than being cramped at a hotel. They enjoyed the pool (which also has a fun waterfall area to stand and play in) and the playground. We also checked out a bunch of balls for the raquetball court and spent an hour just bouncing balls off the walls. The bathtub was enormous and made bathtime for two boys very quick, fun and splashy. And it was so nice to be able to put them to bed in one room and be able to stay up later watching tv or talking and not disturb them. Lastly, the location is perfect.

We were able to use the pool, change rooms, game room etc. and there are free towels provided poolside. When we did get in the room ($73-expedia for 9 nights) couldn't be more impressed. We were in Saturn 3rd floor. Big clean and stocked, so I'm not sure of the other reviews? We caught the cold snap, so be warned units are not heated and did have a chill in the master due to the huge window--but I lived! My view on the balcony was of the second mellow- pool, bb courts, tennis courts and picnic area with \"putting green\" kinda lame and lotsa fallen leaves so you really couln't putt. This was great for me because my boys made friends with about 6-7 other boys the same age and they played hoops and football every night. I couln't see nor hear them at the main pool with hot tub....so folks with little ones may want to requeat a room around the kid pool/club house. The property itself is actually very small by disney townhouse/condo standards, which I loved! About 2 blocks around. It is gated and guarded for most of the time--LOVE that. I will say if you have a stroller ask for a 1st floor. No elevators and all your condos will have a door on the back porch opening up to sidwalks for the wee ones. The exits out front do force you to walk in the parkinglot cause there are no sidewalks? So I might be nervous with little ones (toodlers) and why stress on vaca? My boys used the game room alitlle--mini airhockey and 8 good games -all in working order. I used the internet in the cafe one day and you need to pay a small fee with visa or mc only and set up a temp acct. Even to use your lap top requires this. The room was fab- big master suite with a jacuzzi tub big enough for 2+ (nice for a couple to have some romance during the trip--make the time!) All the beds were pillow top and tons of drawer and closet space. Safe easy to use. It seemed each condo has its own small h2o heater and air unit, we had no water pressure problems or anything. Bring or buy laundry soap and dish washer soap (they give you 2 days worth). The only \"down\" side and to me it was no biggy is there is no maid service. Now I was doing a load everymorning during my coffee/mom time while everyone slept so I didn't mind throwing in the towels. This may bother some. This is not your place then. I only found out on day 8 that on request you can borrow a vacume and mop--too late for me then but I would have on day 5. There is a broom and dust pan and an iron&board. This was worth it to me for the price and location and $ I save on only using 1 checked bag on the flight (each had a carry-on). Speaking of location--wonderful. 3 min to epcot/mgm 5 to MK and the side rode your on takes you right to animal kingdom 2min. I got \"home\" before my girlfriend who was staying at Old Key West on Disney property. You can walk to the super K/denn'y/dunkin donuts and more in under 3 min. THe keys work out well for the kids. They are cards and they can get wet. The kids also use them to trade in at the front dest when they take equipment to play with. They have a soday and water machine on premisis and my 16yr old used the small but decent weight room. Thats all-I thought it was great.

Full kitchen with large fridge. There is a washer and dryer in every unit. And the resort gives you free detergent. They also give you dishwashing detergent. One evening, the kids went to the pool and used the bath towels, so I called front desk and within 5 minutes, they brought us clean bath towels. There is wireless internet availble, free of charge but only in the lobby area. They do have computers to go on the internet, but you have to pay for this. I cant remember how much it was. But get the weekly rate, it's much cheaper than the daily rate. The hotel is located conveniently off US-192. We could not hear any traffic from our rooms. It is very easy to get to and from the parks. There is a McDonalds accross the street (192). We walked to it one night. We felt safe. There is a security guard at the gate during the day.

The room was technically the same but felt far different. 1. The toilet wouldn't flush. You had to hold down the handle for the entire cycle to get it to flush down. 2. The stopper in the Jacuzzi in the bathroom was broke. Couldn't retain water. 3. Couldn't get through a shower without having it run out of hot water 4. We weren't given a brillo pad to wash the dishes and pots with. Even after going to the front desk and asking for something, they told us they didn't have anything available. I remembered our last time staying there we were given one and it came in quite handy. Furthermore, as we were leaving on the last day, I saw brillo pads in the starter packs that were to be prepped for incoming guests. 5. Overall feel was old and grungy. The bathrooms looked outdated and old. Soap melts super fast and is gone within 1 or 2 uses. Altho the front desk will give you more if you ask for it, still a good idea to bring your own stuff so you don't have to keep asking.

We arrived early, before check in a 4pm and we were given a room right away; which was nice. We were housed in the Mercury building on the end. The rooms are showing signs of age. Paint pealing in the bathroom, wallpaper missing etc. While checking in we were handed our keys and told to see \"Jennifer\" at the desk behind us. She welcomed us to the \"resort\" as if she was an employee and offered us breakfast or lunch. She said to reserve our space we would have to pay $20.00 which we would get back once we arrived at the breakfast. She told us there was some info, for a \"new vacation program.\" My husband and I quickly asked her if it was a timeshare presentation....SHE SAID NO. Since we have had experiences with times shares, we were NOT interested one bit to go through that crap again! Low and behold, the next morning was arrived at he breakfast....to be greeted by the SHARKS! The whole feel had timeshare all over it! We were taken up stairs and offered breakfast! WHAT A FARSE...the had apples, donuts, coffee and juice! What a great breakfast! (Can you feel the sarcasm?) After over an hour and a half, we were finally \"allowed\" to leave. We were given our $20.00 back in the form of a Visa gift card with an additional $80.00. I know you may be thinking, \"well you got $80.00 for free.\" I'd would rather not have it! TIMESHARE presentations are not fun in any way shape or form! Once we got back to our \"resort\" I spoke to the Manager Tom; who was lovley! He told me that he gets these complaints at least 2 times a week. My question is why do they allow these people in the front lobby to LIE to their guests. It makes the resort look bad too! After complaining ( 3 times) to the \"guest service\" people that sent us on the timeshare presentation, we received a \"free\" lunch in Celebration. I will say that I had a wonderful time in Celebration, the city was \"perfect\" in a Stepford Wives\" type of way! THE RESORT: The rooms are large, 2 bedrooms, with a pullout. We had our 4 kids with us, and they slept fine! The floors were filthy. They looked clean, but if you walked around without shoes on, your feet were BLACK! Other than that, it was clean ( I think) 2 pools...1 with 2 water slides, the kids loved it! The sauna was on again, off again....not in the best shape. Tennis courts Shuffle board Basketball BBQ's...which my husband LOVED! Security at the front enterance and walking around at night Walking distance to McDonalds, Denny's, Ponderosa, Sizzlers etc. 15 min. drive to Universal 5 min drive to Disney In room safe BAD STUFF: 5.99 a day or 29.99 a week to use WiFi! Go to the McDonalds across the street and have a coffee to use theirs for FREE $.80 a call (even to 1-800's) Don't use your calling card from here! NO shuttle to any park! They will call one for you are YOUR CHARGE! Liki Tiki (you only pay for parking $5.35, but you are NOT allowed to bring ANY food or drinks with you for the day!) You MUST buy their expensive small portion food!!! Don't waste your time!

The week before Memorial Day, last week of the pre-season turned out to be darned close to perfect timing for us. It was peaceful and quiet. Check-in: We were early yet they had a first floor unit available so we checked in about 3 hours early. The unit was great - curtains in all rooms worked for both privacy and heat control - it was clean - there were supplies: extra tp in each bathroom, bars of soap, a box of laundry deterg, packet of dishwasher deterg, a brillo pad, roll of paper towels, and a tiny bottle of dishwashing soap. The kitchen was fully stocked, and everything worked. There was a broom and dustpan in a closet as well as iron/ironing board, and a hairdryer. Midweek when we exchanged towels, we got another packet of dishwasher detergent and another box of laundry soap, as well as more tp. Nice touches we don't expect from a time-share. This is a small place, only about 10 buildings of approximately 24 units each, give or take. They are set in a small circle around a center area which includes a tennis court, bbq and picnic area, arcade building, pool, playground. The front of the place has a children's pool and a jacuzzi. The kids' pool is great for young kids with a slide and was quite active in the early evenings. And that left the other pool for the adults. It was peaceful. Our unit had a tv in the living room and each of the 2 bedrooms, a stereo in the 2nd bedroom, whirlpool tub in the master, and a dvd player in the living room. There is no smoking in the unit except on the porch. The dining area was plenty large and comfortable. Beds were comfortable and we slept well. However, the living room sofas are a bit hard but in good shape and clean. My only complaint about our week is that this place DOES have WiFi but we didn't learn about it until our last night - and only by accident. My stepson (20 yo) was on the porch connecting his cellphone to his laptop and he stumbled into a wifi network - it turned out to be Orbit One's and the charge was minimal!! Had we known, we would have brought our own laptop! Orbit One, YOU NEED TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS! It is not listed on their website, the list of amenities when you check in does not have a word about this.

Our last few stays in Orlando have been at a different RCI resort, but that resort no longer uses SkyAuction, so I have been looking for another condo to use for our Orlando stay. CHECK IN Check in went very smoothly and the staff was very friendly. We were given a very nice 2 bedroom on the 3rd floor of Venus. The 3rd floor had vaulted ceilings and lots of light and was very spacious, clean and bright. NOISE LEVEL One difference between this place and some of the newer places I noticed immediately was the NOISE. We could hear our neighbors on both sides and I am sure they could hear us. The people on both sides were very nice families and were not loud party animals or anything, so I really do think the noise was just normal movement around the condo. I am a very light sleeper so noise levels are very important to me. AMMENITIES There was a washer and dryer in the closet and I am very glad. We have three young boys, so having a laundry was handy. The dryer was mounted to the wall and the washer was below. The lid to the washer didn't open much because of the location of the dryer, so we had to feel the clothing in the washer and pull it out piece by piece. It was just a minor inconvenience, but worth mentioning as it was difficult to reach in for smaller items. It was also very noisy and the washer \"walked\" around in the closet. The biggest noise for us was the heater. It got cold that week and we turned the heater on. It sounded like a huge can of something was in the vent rolling around. Finally we removed the filter and that seemed to help. INTERNET Another HUGE issue for us was internet use. You can buy internet use for $6 per day. I guess that isn't a bad price overall, but we didn't opt to use it. BOTTOM LINE Overall, the stay was pleasant.

I would definetely return for the same price.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cOrbit One is nice place\u201d", "Author": "DrivingMan", "ReviewID": "UR8619225", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Orbit One in Kissimmee , FL over the Labor Day weekend...Our room was large, 2 bedroom/2 bath, and clean. 3 TVs...Having a full kitchen and dinning area was nice and very usefull. One thing that struck me as odd was that there were very few people staying here.. The place was deserted, literally, no one was there ( and yet they put us on the 3rd floor ). There are no elevators here... We stayed here for budget reasons....The Liki Tiki was more money....However, for $5.95 a day you can go to the Liki Tiki ( both Liki Tiki and Orbit One are Island One properties ). Orbit One is less expensive than the Liki Tiki, so we stayed at Orbit to safe $$s and took a day pass to the Liki Tiki.. ( Although, if I had to do it again, I would have booked the Liki Tiki and paid the $50 more per night ). Pros: Location is great - close to lots of dining and shopping. Rooms were clean.. and area is quiet. Rooms were large - great for kids. Day pass to Liki Tiki \"water park\": for $5.95/day.. Has a washer and dryer in room. Cons: Small resort - not much to do within the resort area.. Pool could have been cleaner. Older resort, buidlings look like they are in need of :\"refreshing\" the outsides, however the inside rooms were clean. Overall, I give the Orbit One a 4 out of 5. It was nice stay for us. Clean rooms , quiet and great location.... However, I don't understand why there were so few other vacationers there..", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay and great location.\u201d", "Author": "matthew777", "ReviewID": "UR8514426", "Content": "First of all we are from the UK, family of 4 with a 8yr old and a 11yr old, so travel both west to the States and Caribbean and thorough ought Europe so have done quality and ruff and ready. So hopefully you will get a balanced view as being a Yorkshire man we say it how it is. So orbit one over all was a good place to stop. The rooms were good, not perfect but for that you need five star accommodation. The rooms were the most important thing, CLEAN ok there was the odd bit of trim missing but we are only talking the odd chip and the utensils and the kitchen was spotless. Now the bathrooms weren\u2019t quite 10/10 with the Jacuzzi tired and noisy with a habit of turning the water brown. Now this to be honest wasn\u2019t a problem as I didn\u2019t fly all the way there just for a Jacuzzi . But overall the rooms were large and airy. Ok there wasn\u2019t a lift and it was a pain getting to the top floor without a lift but many places don\u2019t and im happy to work with a few steps at the beginning and end of the day. The pool was fine but the furniture round it has seen better days. With luck they have changed this by now. Staff well pretty average. No probs, no heavy time share push but they weren\u2019t exactly running round after you. Location its good for Disney I have to say. The best recommendation is \u201cwould you go back again\u201d well it has to be a big YES on this one. So in short it was fine, we liked our stay there and its good value for money which is all important. Nothing worse than coming back and feeling you got a poor return for your money", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Orbit One Vacation Villas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d84804-Reviews-Orbit_One_Vacation_Villas-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$82 - $127*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2950 Entry Point Boulvard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34741</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "84804", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/69/1f/48/orbit-one-vacation-villas.jpg"}}

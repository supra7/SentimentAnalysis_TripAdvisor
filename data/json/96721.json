I am very familiar with the Renaissance brand and a Marriott platinum member. This property was disappointing and a little off from what I usually expect from a Renaissance. First, I had to call twice, with an over 20 minute wait, for the hotel shuttle - late at night. I watched numerous hotel and rental car buses go by more than once. On the second call - after I was getting creeped out waiting out in the pick up area, almost alone, the phone rang (literally) over 25 rings before anyone answered. I had the same non answering experience the following morning when I had attempted to call the front desk to ask a question. Only this time - no one answered - twice in a row. I gave up. Other odd missteps - the hotels magazine was actually under the sheets and mattress pad on my bed, when I got in I heard a crumpled sound and wondered what in the world, only to find the magazine stuck under there - odd. The shuttle driver, I was convinced, was not even a Renaissance employee. I was picked up in a white cab truck with the renaissance logo DUCT Taped onto the side of it. He had 2 girls sitting up front with him. The driver had a white box with oranges, apples and waters in it - odd and began babbling on about how he would be \"our driver\" if I wanted to go to a bar or convenient store. I just wanted him to shut up. Then on arrival, he planted himself right next to me at the check in counter and stared at me until I forked over the obligatory tip - I asked the clerk to cash my 20 - and he handed me 1 10 and 2 5's. Annoying, as I had no intention of tipping this much for an over 20 minute late overly solicitous ride, with 2 girlfriends in the front seat and super weirdness in terms of the offers for transportation. Mind you, I am no newby - and this just smelled odd - and as a female traveling alone - which I frequently do all over the country, I did not appreciate the presumptive nature of the experience. The staff overall were friendly, but I did not receive my platinum food gift - I realize it was late at night - but why offer it then? The room was clean, but the bed not as comfortable as the usual Renaissance bed - even after I removed the magazine. No flat screen tv - very old school box style and small. Bathroom ok - shower curtain (which I hate - but a girl cant expect everything - can she?). Concierge lounge was fine - I had no complaints there. I will say the shuttle service the next morning was exactly what I would have expected - polite, on time and friendly. Overall, this hotel needs some work. Its just not what I expected and thats the very reason I frequently stay in Marriott hotels - because I know what to expect.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cRenaissance hotel Philladelphia\u201d", "Author": "deb-5584", "ReviewID": "UR122833173", "Content": "Very clean and nice hotel, friendly staff, excellent concierge, need more space for parking, which probably impossible due to the wetland.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cOK?

While making the reservation it says on there website NO BOOKING FEE'S WHEN BOOKING ON MARRIOT.COM. I also called up the hotel just to verify that there would be no fee's. I was told I would not be charged ANYTHING until the day of check out. on my way to the hotel I called up my bank to check my account and realized my balance was lower by a few hundred dollars. So when I checked into the hotel I asked the lady If they had already charged me, She told me no and informed me that they do put the total on hold until check out, my total was $335.00. When I returned home I had a bank charge of $418.00!!!!! I called the hotel back and they told me it was a security hold incase I didnt show up for my reservation and that it was refunded back to my account at checkout and would take a few days before its avalable,I flipped, because not ONE time was I ever informed of a security hold. I was told NO FEE'S and because of this \"fee\" my bank account overdrafted!! Also the hotel is severly understaffed. I stayed a total of 2 nights and 3 days in this hotel and not one time was my room serviced. no beds made, no vaccuming. They had ONE lady working the whole floor that I was on. which is around 100 rooms. NOT her fault but the staffing leaves something to be desired. The room itself upon arrival \"seemed\" nice and comfy, but upon closer inspection it was dusty and the toilet seemed as if it hadnt been cleaned in a month. when i first glanced at it i thought someone had forgotten to flush. But no It was stains in the bottom of the bowl. The floors in the bathroom were sticky. Whoever cleaned this room did what I like to call a \"illusion cleaning job\" or cover up. The pool was disgusting the whole room and locker rooms reeked of urine and the water smelled like urine. it seemed there was no clorine in the water. Im not sure if its the color of the pool itself or if the water WAS actually green. after getting out of the pool you feel like you have a slime over your skin. They also have a VERY hard time keeping things refilled. such as clean pool towels,coffee in the lobby and items in your room itself, I suppose this is due to being understaffed. The beds were extremely uncomfortable!!!!!! I woke up so stiff my husband had to help me out of bed. On the up side, \"what staff there was\" was very nice and polite. But really didnt offer any compesation to the troubles we encountered. Yes the hotel has low rates, but I would never referr anyone to this hotel. EVER!!!! I also woke up in the morning with these phantom bug bites all over my legs and arms. I didnt actually see bugs and this could be due to mosquitoes outside.

It's an older property, but still maintains the high standards you come to expect from a Marriott/Renaissance hotel. We immediately felt so welcomed by the front desk staff member who checked us in (Patrick). His bright & friendly personality was just what we needed after a long drive. He quickly checked us in, and gave us all the information we needed about the hotel (gym, pool, restaurants, parking, etc.). The next morning, we hit the gym, and had a great workout with plenty of state of the art equipment, water, towels, tv's, etc. This is a complimentary service as well. The pool is beautiful, in a fully enclosed atrium, and some rooms even have balconies that open up to overlook the pool. It is a pretty nice setting. After working out, we went to the restaurant for a delicious breakfast buffet (although they do have a regular menu too, I believe). All the food was great, and fresh. Even better than that was the service we received from our server Tiffany. We were lucky enough to sit in her station both days, and she always went above and beyond for all of her guests. One example I found remarkable was when another guest asked her for some eggs (which were made to order at the buffet), but rather than telling that guest where to find them, she asked how the person wanted them prepared, and then she went over to the buffet & ordered them for the guest, and delivered them to her personally. It just seemed so great to me... and the guest was thrilled with her order. This young lady was professional, friendly, and really made us feel special. Our room was pretty nice. We stayed in a spacious junior suite, and the bed was super comfortable. The bedding was crisp & clean, and they use the linen duvets, so you know they are fresh (I am not a fan of hotel bedspreads, so I was very happy). One more thing to note, this hotel was nice & quiet. Despite the very close proximity to the airport, we did not hear a single plane the entire time we were there... although we viewed several planes taking off from our bedroom window. Very good soundproofing! The only downside I can think of is the parking. There is plenty of parking, and it is free, however the lot is quite large, and much of the parking is a little far from the entrance... and so you may have a long walk if you happen to come home late one night. I also don't think they offer valet parking. If you happen to be flying out of PHL, they do appear to have a complimentary shuttle (FYI). Checking out was quick & easy as well, and Sean at the front desk seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a great time... which we did!

The next morning under closer inspection (with more daylight) I found the bed to be quite dirty with stains on the sides and corners...there was a mattress pad and cover but they were littered with pubic hair and I found several small, dead bugs on the mattress under the mattress pad. They did not appear to be bed bugs but I could not identify them, even upon closer inspection with a camera. There was a chaise lounge in the room that had stains all over it as well. I awoke in the middle of the night running a fever and feeling very sick, which is probably when I was being bitten, but didn't know it at the time. I also used the exercise room in the morning which I found to be quite dirty as well.

It's not terrible...it's okay, depending on your requirements. Not-so-good: We paid for access to the concierge lounge. Not worth it. It's open from 5 to 10 p.m. then opens again for breakfast until 10 a.m. You can't even pick up a bottle of water outside of the alotted time frame. The evening service was nice; the lady attending stayed on top of keeping the tables clean and the food and beverages fresh. We stopped in for breakfast early the next morning, and I'm sorry to say it was mediocre. Another lady was attending, and maybe it was too much for her to handle by herself. The coffee and hot water carafes were allowed to sit empty for an extended period of time, the tables were not wiped clean through several 'waves' of guests coming through. The 'scambled eggs' sat in yellow water puddles at the bottom of the server. They ran out of items and when guests asked for them the lady had to tell them that she didn't have it; in fact the entire hotel ran out of the same items. Poor lady - not her fault. She was nice. C'mon HOTEL MANAGER - send someone to the nearest supermarket and buy the items guests are requesting. Bananas, milk for the kids' cereal...not exotic, hard-to-find items. Surprisingly, the counter area that held the warm foods (oatmeal and scrambled eggs) had 4 light sconces on the walls above. I almost took a picture with my cell phone to post here. They were hanging off the wall at different angles, the shades half off. The handle on the little acrylic case holding the bagels and bread slices actually partially came off when I opened it. It was hanging by one screw. This is not a \"concierge lounge.\" Do not pay for it. On another note: dust in the room. Must have been in the corners because the furniture was not dusty; in fact the room appeared clean. My poor husband is still sneezing and we checked out this morning! The windows do not open, even a bit, so it's all circulating through the room. Good: The proximity to the Philadelphia Airport is fantastic. We had to pick someone up on the morning we checked out, and it literally took us under 5 minutes from the hotel's front door to the airport's Arrival curb. Turn right out of the parking lot and head straight to the airport. The bathroom was acceptably clean, although the little lotion bottle was half-full and the hair-dryer & bag could use a good cleaning. The staff is friendly. Free parking & large parking lot (lots of spaces). Free USA Today and Wall Street Journal. Nice indoor pool, although you have to walk through the lobby to get there. Never been a fan of walking through the center of a hotel to go to the pool. Shuttle service to the airport. Nice restaurant (didn't eat there, however very attractive room), & nice bar (had a cold draft in the late evening before we went up to our room). Comfortable mattress, clean linens, feather pillows available. If we had to stay in a hotel to catch a morning flight, I would stay there again. It's cheaper than the airport Marriott (by half).

This is where my company forces us to stay due to the low rate. At first you are like......wow....a Renaissance. This place is nothing to get excited about, trust me. LOCATION: At the end of the airport runway, sort of tucked away in a business park. There is absolutely nothing within walking distance except a couple of office buildings. It's literally surrounded by a swamp. I'm not sure you could even go for a walk if you wanted to. SHUTTLE: Generally OK. However, the vans also double as an employee shuttle to the airport (so can can catch the airport train). You can spot the employees standing outside the front entrance smoking. Classy, huh? SERVICE: Hot and Cold. Really no other way to put it. I've dealt with some really nice folks that were rather helpful. But mostly you are dealing with total apathy. In fact, there are a few employees I dealt with whom I thought were going to pull out a gun and rob me. Needless to say, the staff is without a doubt unrefined and a little gritty. I don't think most people like their job or the company they work for. Just a little guess. ROOMS: This is where this place REALLY needs some attention. For starters, the decor is early 90's, if not earlier. The furnishings (some of which are falling apart) are a mish-mash of styles that don't really go together. The bedding is not bad and I generally slept well. The bathrooms are rather large. HOUSEKEEPING/UPKEEP: Can I give MINUS 5 stars here? Whoever runs their housekeeping department needs to be fired. Where do I start......... 1. Twice, my bathroom had USED (yes, including the mouthwash) toiletries that were less than full. 2. Sheets/pillowcases that I'm not sure were changed (mystery spots!) from the last guest. I finally started \"marking\" the sheets with a little shampoo or toothpaste to make sure they got changed. 3. Lots of scuff marks/stains on doors, walls, etc 4. A tub that would almost completely stop up. I love standing in dirty water. 5. In the gym, I found a lone piece of fruit rotting in a fruit bowl....with a roach crawling on it. Yum. 6. There was a cobweb (with spider) outside the front entrance between a post and a shrub. I don't think anyone had paid it any attention for months. 7. Maids bang on the door (or call your room) starting very early wanting to know what time you are leaving. 8. One morning, 2 maids got into a cat fight right in the hallway right outside my room. Nice. IF YOU ARE GOING TO STAY HERE: 1. I hope it's REALLY cheap. I mean REALLY cheap. 2. Avoid a room that has a window/sliding glass door that opens into the atrium-pool area. You get a VERY strong whiff of chlorine. 3. Try and get on the 10th (top floor). I get the idea those rooms are the \"real\" rooms they actually get cleaned. 4. There isn't much as far as food at the hotel. Some days, it appeared as if the restaurant was closed, even during peak eating times. In any case, there is NO food available (even room service) after midnight. SECURITY: Let's just say....the employees here don't make me feel confident about my safety and security. Twice, I had key problems with inoperative keys. In any case, I would avoid this place if you can. There is a brand new Marriott at the airport that is walking distance to the terminal.

My wife, my one year old son and I were stranded in Philadelphia after our flight was cancelled. Here is my review- 1. Transportation. The airport shuttle drivers were terrific. The individual that picked us up from the airport was friendly and helpful. Another shuttle bus driver agreed to take my wife to a local store to get baby formula. They went well beyond their jobs to help out. 2. Physical Condition: As we pulled up to the hotel, I immediately recognized the hotel as an old Radission that I had stayed in back in '97. Given that the hotel was now carrying the Renaissance name, I had expected that it had been renovated. No such luck. The room (Room 500) was aging, the door lock latch was broken and the bathtub drained extremely slowly. 3. Cleanliness: The hotel housekeeping staff isn't performing its' job. There was a stain on the comforter and a dirty tissue from a previous guest left behind the curtains. Additionally, our room had an indoor balcony that had a dead cockroach on it. If you're an optimist, I suppose you could say that it was an indication that they hotel's pest control service is doing its' job, but I'd prefer not to see cockroaches in the hotels in which I'm staying. 4. Service. I had to make the request for crib three times before one was finally brought to our room. I will say that my negative experiences were all with the nighttime hotel staff. Our interactions with the day staff were somewhat better. I hate to give this hotel a poor rating because the shuttle bus drivers were so helpful and went out of their way to help.

The upgraded room did have a seperate room with a large table and chairs for perhaps a meeting, and the bedroom was large and included a small couch. Once settled, we took a small walk around the property and ventured into the bar. While the bar is nothing that special, it was clean had a flat screen tv.

There was a wonderful woman who was in charge of the room and kept things running smoothly. She was very personable and plesant. She was very familiar with the \"regulars\" as she knew their names etc. I imagine that would make a traveller feel more at home. She promptly introduced her to us. What a great person.

Upon asking, the front desk was very willing to upgrade us to Concierge level- but since the Concierge Club Lounge is not open on weekends (this hotel is hardly busy on the weekends apparently), they also gave us complimentary passes for a continential breakfast buffet (could upgrade to the full hot buffet for $3). Buffet was okay, not great but did have an omelette station. The room was recently renovated, but still had a slight air fresher scent (a concern I had given other recent reviews). Very nice bedding. Quiet room. Large bathroom with good shower and good toiletries (come on, you know you're gonna take 'em home). Room renovation was ongoing, so just make sure your room is one of the renovated ones and not close to any ongoing work. The pool area is very nice, decent exercise room and the staff was very accommodating. Parking is free- which is a significant deal.

The other complaint is that when we flew back in we waited for over an hour for the hotel shuttle, saw all the the other hotel shuttles multiple times, and then finally called the hotel, They said that we were supposed to call for pick up but that is not what we were told. We were told that the shuttel runs every 20 minutes so we were trying to be patient. They then told us it would be 10 minuted to get us and about 20 minutes later, they finally came (they are only 1 mile from the airport) and the driver said that you need to call them unless it is a busy time of day for travelers.

The staff at the front desk was always courteous and helpful. One night we asked for directions to nearby movies and the person was extremely helpful with locations and other suggestions in the area. The location of the hotel is convenient for anyone needing a hotel near the airport or visiting the Philly area. The hotel is well located with easy access to I-95. It took us less than 15 minutes to drive to and from Philly downtown from the hotel. Overall, this Renaissance is much better to other hotels including its partners, Marriotts.

To make a long story short, wechecked in and spoke with Patrick, a lovely man from Haiti that speaks 5 languages...quite impressive.

Got the senior rate of $110 which is a decent but not outstanding value. We had stayed at this property on 5 or 6 previous occasions, always on week-ends and have generally been satisfied with it. The room--on the 9th floor-was clean, fresh-smelling and what we wanted. There was a view of the air conditioning equipment on a lower, flat room, but we weren't there for the view and only used the hotel to sleep. Check-in was smooth, quick and courteous. We arrived shortly after noon and the front desk made a special effort to have a room serviced so that we wouldn't have to return late at night and check-in again. All of the staff we met were friendly and helpful. Parking was OK and free (my favorite price) but although the lot is large, it always seems to be fairly full and finding a space requires a careful search. Both the room and some of the public areas of the hotel are beginning to show wear. It isn't a serious issue for the most part, but does require attention. One family member spent Aug 3 and 4 at this property and always has liked it. She also mentioned that her room was not up to the standard of previous stays. Our room had what looked like a spilled red wine stain on the bathroom wallpaper. [It was between the toilet and the tub, low on the wall and not immediately noticeable.] The foot stool fabric was completely torn or worn through on one corner, showing the padding. The entry to the hotel needs a good power washing, sealing and regrouting in some areas. A careful inspection of the hotel likely will turn up dozens if not hundreds of places that need maintenance attention soon. This property still is above average for the Philadelphia Airport Hotel properties we have used: Sheraton Suites, Embassy Suites, and Residence Inn, though some of those mentioned obviously offer more space and comparisons aren't completely fair. We would stay there again and, despite the comments above, were happy with the place and the rate. If I stayed during the week and paid twice as much, I would be far less satsified.

Definitely make sure you do this, because the breakfast is fine, but not really worth the $12 per person they charge. They also seem to have a regular menu to choose from, but we just had the buffet.

I called down for more towels and they arrived very quickly (within 10 minutes) and the desk staff person called a few minutes later to make sure we had gotten them. We were in town for a wedding west of Philly, and this was close to the interstate, so very convenient for getting to where we wanted to go. We also went into downtown Philly for the afternoon and it took only 20 minutes. My only complaint was the difficulty we had finding the hotel. Another reviewer here mentioned this, and I should have taken it more seriously! The directions on the website are USELESS, so don't take them. Even the Google maps directions were vague unless you are familiar with the area, so maybe call the hotel and get someone to give you specific directions? Once you actually get there, there is no sign at the entrance to tell you where to turn, so we found ourselves elated at finally finding it, only to despair as we drove past it again, realizing we would have to go back to the main road to turn around and start again. A little frustrating after a long flight. One more tiny complaint: my husband had to run back to the airport for a lost item and took the hotel shuttle, which was fine, but he waited a long time for it to come pick him up later.

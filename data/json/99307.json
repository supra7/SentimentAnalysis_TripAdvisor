There is a sub way entrance outside the hotel that will take u straight to canal st (china town) and ground zero. Staff tend to leave u alone( no tips ). BAD POINTS Elevators, only three for 27 floors, u could sometimes wait upto 10 mins for one and if you're up high or carrying luggage that's a lot of flights to walk and when one dose come its full aghhhh. The lobby, sometimes it's like a zoo, credit card needed for checking in even if room is paid for in advance make sure and read the small print.

Easy walking to any of the Broadway shows, This is an older hotel but in good condition. The only inconvenience was the elevators in the morning. It took quite a while to get one going down that wasn't full. A fair amount of frustrated people waiting inside and outside of the elevator. The trick to getting in before it's too crowded is to push the UP button and catch it on its way up before its full. You'll have a longer ride but at least your in.

The bed was very comfortable. I have no complaints. The only thing is that the shower stall curtain is short. So that means when you take a shower, water still ends up on the floor.

They send up a maintenance guy and it turns out the heater wasn't even on. 1h later the heater turned off yet again and the front desk decided to switch our room and upgrade us to a king room.

First thing to say is that in my opinion this is not a business hotel, and cannot be judged on those criteria. You have to choose carefully in New York. That said, I think this is an excellent tourist choice, particularly for families. There were several student parties and coach tourists. As the title says, location is everything. On 7th Ave and 55th St, it is a few blocks easy walking distance to Central Park (going north) and Fifth Ave (east). Rockerfeller Centre five blocks south-east. Going due south gets you to Times Square in about twenty mins-that is with a buggy/stroller. Carnegie Hall is a few yards away. There is a Subway on the doorstep. The M7 bus gets you to Broadway and down to Macy's/Empire State Building easily. The M5 goes from Fifth Ave right down to Battery Park and the ferries. Coming back it stops by the hotel. Anyway,the hotel. I was aware of differing reports but, like most things, you need to trust your nose and try it for yourself. I liked the \"olde worlde\" mature look of the place. As my grandson observed when we drew up, \"wow this is a fancy hotel!\". It does have charm. Check-in was easy, and we were allocated two rooms on the 12th(top) Floor of the East Wing. I would guess this is the older wing, and definitely not as high as the main wing. The basic double room for my wife and I was very clean, well decorated, with good quality bedlinen. It was definitely \"New York size\", which we found perfectly adequate. The shower was spotless and worked well. My son, his wife and their two children thoughtfully were given a suite right next door.This was huge, with a fridge and microwave. No good views, but facing way from the 7th Ave traffic meant minimal external noise. The internal walls let through some noise. I am struggling to find any downsides. The only potential irritant I can think of is that the two East Wing elevators are quite slow, and not that big. This was not a problem for us, but if you get stuck behind a school party... We did not use the diner on the ground floor, so unable to comment, but it did seem pretty full up. Prices not bad compared to what I have paid on other NYC hotels. No free wi-fi, unfortunately. USD 5.00 for half an hour using your own machine, or there are five desktops down near reception, not sure of the rates. Check out was again seamless, and storing your cases between check out and pick up was a well oiled operation.

We also didn't have a safe in our room (the hotel does offer safety deposit boxes, but we didn't want to carry our passports and all our cash on us all the time / have to keep queuing at reception every time we wanted to get them).

Then the manager Jim tried to tell us that my son was not included with the breakfast that would be $28.00 more. Since I told Jim I wasn't happy because this was supposed to be included in our package. Jim told us if we didn't like it, we could find another hotel. Not knowing a sole in NYC and being 8:30 pm where was I going to find a hotel. We told him to just give us the room and we were only going to pay what was originally quoted. Our travel agent was able to get a hold of another manager the next day that was kind enough to give us the 2 additional coupons for my son to have breakfast with us. We were notified by our agent at 12:30 that he had taken care of the matter for us. The room was nice. The beds had plenty of room to get around them. We had a couch, coffee table, tv, walk in closet, a microwave and a refrigerator. The refrigerator had left over food in it from the people before us. I called the front desk to ask them to please clean the refrigarator for us. Which they did take care of. The bathroom was small, but we weren't expecting anything really fancy either. The price was an awesome price. The hotel was in a great location to see many attractions. We loved the room, but the service Jim gave us wasn't good, it was terrible. Then when we went to check out there was $60.00 added onto our room for breakfast which was included in our package. Luckily we had a different manager that fixed the problem and told us it was a computer glich. We really liked the hotel, but you definately have to make sure that if you go here that you bring your confirmation slip (just like us) with any documentation from your agent and make sure that you are not overcharged. This put a damper on our trip to NYC. The only thing is that we did meet a lot of wonderful people in NYC that were helpful and courteous! You must go to the Empire State Building, even if there is zero visiblity we still had a wonderful time. The men up at the top are very nice to talk to and they point out special areas. I hope that you have a completely wonderful trip if you go to NYC. P.S. the subway was safer than I thought. Wonderful people there to help assist through out the city.

Perhaps I was lucky but even though I have stayed in better for size and luxury I have also stayed in a lot worse for the same money. Maid service was daily and even though the on suite was small it was adequate and always had hot water and descent shower water pressure. Our room on the 24th floor overlooked 7th Avenue with Central Park in the distance, and ok there were other skyscrapers overlooking us but hey we were in New York so what do you expect. TV free channel choice was good and the 3 lifts were quick and comfortable. On the whole I was pleased with my choice of Hotel and especially the location (just up from Times square, down from Central Park, right of Broadway and left of 5th Avenue for shopping). Would I recommend it? Yes if you don't want to pay for lavish frills but do want cleanliness, comfort, location and value for money. When you are in the City that never sleeps the amount of time you will spend in your room will be minimal. There's so much to see and time is limited so the ratio of time in room to time out of room is going to be small. Plenty of Maps/brochures in the lobby, my best friend was the New York tourist booklets on the Concierge/bell boy desk. These contained a street map of New York plus a subway map so easy to carry around both in one booklet. Attraction tip 9/11 memorial site entrance is in Albany Street a couple of blocks from the site itself, you have to pre order a pass (this is free) 24 hours before your visit, making sure you get there at least 15mins earlier than your allocated time to go through security (xray etc.) before entering site. Your pass can be printed off via email or picked up at the site before entrance. Don't forget the memorial exhibition on exit as this is easy to miss. This will eventually be on site but hasn't been finished yet. http://www.911memorial.org/visit Food: Prices for food can be expensive so be careful as none include their expected 20% tip. The Park Cafe adjoining the hotel we found to be the cheapest and best value restaurant locally. Big breakfasts.......and evening meals are around 30$ for two including tips. This was more than enough food for one day. We then bought a muffin or cake and tea/coffee for lunch for about 8$ for two. Fluffys a few doors down from the hotel had an excellent range of cakes, baguettes and wraps at really good prices so would recommend if you wanted something other than cooked. Baguettes were around 6$ and cakes/muffins/cookies 2$. Drinking out: Alcohol is extremely expensive, on average a small glass of wine 9.50$ and a bottle of bud 7$ cost 20$ with tip. So be warned. Transport: The best and cheapest way we found to get around was either walking (beware of the distances, they are greater than you expect) or subway. Subway you can buy a card which you add money too but these can be restrictive on limited time usage (some same day some not) or we preferred to pay single trips (from automated machines) of either 2.50$ each, each trip or $4.75 (any distance with unlimited changes) if there was a ticket booth. We found that this was the easiest and non restrictive, then working out the route to various sites between short distances on the way back to our hotel so usually ending up arriving back on foot. (beware of blisters though. I recommend taking blister plasters and foot tape just in case.) Hop on Hop off buses we found were convenient and would take you where you wanted to go but as these were designed for the tourists they seemed expensive for one -two days at $44 per person. We didn't try the taxis as this wasn't necessary and we weren't in a hurry. It seemed from others that the fees were reasonable. There are also rickshaws available but again I can't give you a definite price but I would think these were going to be cheaper than the taxis. Horse rides in Central Park were around $40 Attractions: I bought a City Pass from the American Museum for $79 per adult (to make sure it was genuine) and found this contained all the (chargeable) common sites we wanted to see with fast track facilities included and discount vouchers (free telephone commentary at the Empire State Building). Other passes e.g. 'New York Pass' offered more attractions (and this reflected on the price) but I felt that we wouldn't be saving as much as these included attractions that we wouldn't or didn't want to see. Money: We took cash and credit card for emergencies, they all preferred card (even the taxis) but I felt that charging everything could get out of hand so anything over a $50 note I changed up first due to the shops/cafe/restaurants not liking to take them. The reception at the hotel was more than happy to do this for me.

The room is typically small for New York, although it does the job. It has all the usual mod cons but can get a little cramped when you bring all the shopping back each day due to lack of storage space! I'd advise having a room on a higher floor as it's less noisy. We initially had a 3rd floor room overlooking 7th avenue, but moved to a quieter room on the 18th floor. The room was okay but the air-con was noisy and the tiny bathroom had a musty smell to it. The bed also felt small but it was comfortable enough. It's usual not to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room. This is because with the huge variety of eateries close by, there really isn't any need to make drinks in the room. The Starbucks opposite the hotel makes great \"English Tea\" and I'd recommend having breakfast in the Deli opposite. Avoid the hotel's diner on the ground floor and the Benash delicatessen next door as they are both overpriced. Friendly, efficient reception staff and porters.

There was a small kitchenette in the hall with a fridge which was a great help for the beer and water! The bathroom (off the kids room) was small but well stocked with a powerful shower. The only problem was the door catch was sticking out and my son really scratched his arm on it after a shower. The bathroom was a tight squeeze for 2 when I helped the kids out the shower. Our bed was King and really comfy. Each room had its own TV. The decor was tired and needed bringing upto the 21st century, but the location is what sells this hotel.

A little niggle was no tea/coffee making facilities which would have been nice to make your own if you wake up at silly o'clock!! We were on the 19th floor and despite what other people have said about the lifts being a bit slow we didn't have any issues, they were a little small so when everyone was heading for breakfast it was a little snug. The location is perfect for Central Park, just a couple of blocks so about 10mins (allowing time to cross the roads) and Time square about 15 mins in the opposite direction. All major sites can be walked to (Empire State Building, Chrysler building, Macy's, Bloomingdales etc), we used the NY City Sightseeing, the guys in the yellow jackets, $54 for 48 hours but spoke to one of the many ticket guys & got an extra day free, even booked the Empire State building with them too. We used the small bakery/diner called Fluffy's (2 coffees, a large yoghurt parfait & an egg & bacon platter totalled around $14 dollars) DO NOT go to Benash on the corner a plate of pancakes with syrup will set you back around $15 plus gratuities. The Park Cafe located at the bottom of the hotel & can be accessed from the inside provide good value meals with drinks we had two mains, one side 3 beers & 3 glasses of wine which cost about $75(\u00c2\u00a349) which sounds a lot but when you go into the Irish bar & pay $20 for 2 beers!!!! Quite a few places DON'T show you the prices for alcohol on the menu so best to check prior to ordering. The Go Airlink shuttle service was efficient, this was booked at the time of booking the trip at a cost of \u00c2\u00a359 return for the 2 of us, cabs have a set price of $50 each way plus tip.

This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Bottom line of this review: Try other significantly better mid-range hotels in the area, including Sheraton, Warwick, or Hotel Penn. I've stayed at over 20 hotels in the past year... this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in my whole life. Stayed here February 2012 on a Friday and Saturday night. Service: At the check-in, 10 people working behind the desk, yet it took nearly 20 minutes to check in? The girl who helped me check in was rude, not helpful. Called for a room upgrade two weeks in advance, hotel staff told me would be no problem on the date of check-in. The joyous girl behind the desk told me incessantly \"We have no upgrades available for the next three days at least.\" \"Sorry ma'am. We have nothing available. You can spend $40 a NIGHT for a king bed on the 5th floor. That's it.\" So bad. Worst customer service at a hotel. Room: The \"upgrade\" to a king bed room for $160 a night was so tiny, even with the king bed upgrade. Even for NYC standards -- SMALL. Gross. Smelly. The bedspread was filthy, old (like from the 90's), ugly, had cigarette holes. The room was constantly hot and sweaty (we had the window open in February the whole weekend) and we didn't have any temperature control. Bed was cheap and uncomfortable. We had to ask for a cot since they didn't have rooms with two beds, so they rolled in a mattress on a wood board. Even the towels were dirty. Just so gross. A view? Yea right. A window with a view of the other side of the hotel and a disgusting courtyard... or concrete ground. At night, the heat would rattle so loud, it sounded like someone was banging on steel pans in our room. We heard screaming from outside our room through the night. The hotel said they had late night security guards. When we came back on Saturday night, a sign said \"Show your ID and hotel room key to the security guard\" ... the guard was sitting inside on a bench on his cellphone, watched us walk by. He was the only employee in the lobby. WiFi? No, a dial-in connection in your room for $5 an hour. Umm, what?!! Ice? Call down to the front desk for that. Wait 20 minutes.

We were so tired when we got back to the hotel and happy to get to our room. It started out interesting as I walked into my room to find 2 of the maids sitting on the couch taking their break. They were very apologetic and left quickly. There were also 2 windows open in our room at the end of January with no screens or bars. I don't know why windows would be open in January and it was very unsafe for children as we were on the 10th floor. The place is very old fashioned and seemed like it was at the very least 50 years old. There seemed to be no effort to update the hotel at all. Our room was very interesting. It was absolutly enormous. We had a living room with a seperate bedroom with 2 double beds. There were 2 tvs in the room, a kitchen with table and a living room with a couch, but it looked like a room out of an old horror movie. The carpet was old and disgusting. I don't know how to explain this, but the floor was uneven underneath the carpet. You'd be walking along and hit a bump, then it would drop, etc... The bathroom wasn't absolutly disgusting, but was still pretty gross. I guess the maids couldn't reach up high on the walls and in corners. It looked like mold was growing in a few spots up high. Around 11:00 I was about to fall asleep and my wife got my attention when she said \"did you hear that\"? I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't. I still have no idea what it was, but it sounded like someone was on the outside brick wall of the hotel, trying to smash through with a pick axe right outside our room. It honestly scared the crap out of us and like I said, we still have no idea what it was. It happened every 45 minutes or so and every time we looked outside it stopped. Needless to say, with the loud noise and fear that someone was trying to get into our room, I couldn't sleep at all and was very disappointed in the morning and frustrated all night. It didn't help that the room was very dry and the pillows sucked. I have never said this before in a review, but I don't think I would stay here again.

It's an older hotel so it has that nostalgic \"old city\" charm; we stayed on the 15th floor, which afforded quite a view. The staff treated us great right from the start. The beds were really comfortable. My husband and I had brought our two teenaged boys for their first trip to New York, so the suite was the way to go, giving us all our own \"space.\" We were close enough to all the sights to walk to most of our destinations -- the boys loved Times Square and since it was so close to the hotel we were comfortable letting them walk down there by themselves at night. Additionally, the Wellington is close to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, and many great restaurants and shops. In fact, one of the best places we ate was the Park Cafe (part of the hotel): breakfast there alone is worth a stay at the Wellington. (And if you love Greek food, the hotel's premier restaurant, Molyvos, is also one of our favorites.) Here's a tip: when we were ready to leave, one of the bellmen suggested we book a car out of the hotel's fleet rather than hire a cab to take us to JFK. For about ten dollars more than cab fare, we saved ourselves the hassle of trying to get a cab off the street, and when the car pulled up to take us to the airport, we were all surprised to find that it was a stretch limo!! The boys were thrilled! What a great way to end our trip in New York! Another big plus is that there is a subway station right next to the hotel. Down side: The only thing we wish we could have changed was that our heater-air conditioner was cranky and tended to be noisy at night. Even so, it wasn't enough to mar our stay at the Wellington. My husband and I have stayed in NY at The Plaza, Le Meridien, and the Millenium Hotel; by far the Wellington was the most fun for the money. We will definitely stay there again! Personal Fun note: Our boys were on a Pizza Mission. They wanted to find the very best slice in NYC. So we ate a lot of pizza on this trip. After talking to people on the street, we got a recommendation for a place in Brooklyn called \"DiFara's.\" From the hotel it was an easy subway trip: we took the Q train and got off on J Ave in Brooklyn and DiFara's was only steps away from the subway station. Yes, DiFara's was theatrical -- yes, it was a bit overpriced -- but our boys are convinced this was the best pizza on the planet. For freshness and uniqueness of flavor, we've decided DiFara's can't be beat! My own fun recommendation: Go see the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Awesome. After three other trips to New York, my husband and I decided this one was the best of all. It was largely due to the Wellington Hotel and its close proximity to all the stuff we wanted to do.

I would not hesitate in staying at this hotel again if I was in New York City. The rooms are a little dated, but spotless! They are cleaned every day with fresh towels. An Iron and ironing board is provided along with a good hairdryer. There are no tea or coffee making facilities but Fluffys diner a block away does the best coffee, Fluffy's are also great for breakfast. We stayed on room only option as there are so many great places to eat in NY that we just wanted to get out and about. I had read in previous reviews before I left that the lifts were very slow, this was not the case in our stay, we stayed on the 26th floor and never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a lift. One thing I did notice was there were not many staff around, in the whole time that we were there the only staff that we saw were three receptionsts and the bell boys, Not that this bothered us as we were not at the Wellington for a lesiure break but to explore NYC. So to sum up! Fantastic location for the price! I would not think twice about staying there again. Warm, clean, comfy room with the whole of NYC to explore on your doorstep. A tip for traveling from JFK to the hotel: Get the skytrain from JFK to Jamaica Station then the subway will take you straight to Broadway, the hotel is just around the corner, all for $7.50 we opted for this so that we could mix with the locals and the price was good too! The whole journey only took an hour, so it is around the same time as a taxi if not quicker. While we were in NY we went for dinner at Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gumps and Stardust Diner, plus some other not so well known restaurants,diners, bars and deli's. We visited just about every attraction that we could fit in so, if anyone wants any more information on my trip about the attractions, hotel or restaurants please get in touch.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cNew Year in New York\u201d", "Author": "goingtravellingcork", "ReviewID": "UR123744144", "Content": "I was quite worried about staying in this hotel after reading the very mixed reviews, but I can honestly say it was very good. We arrived earlier than the check in time so our bags were taken. The concierge( is that what they are called?!) weren't great, apart from one of them. We got a taxi from the airport which turned out to be an expensive $90 but we didn't mind so much as we were tired from the flight. After returning to the hotel, we got our room- we had booked a queen- and found it was fine and big, bathroom was a bit small but what harm, and there was a wardrobe and kitchenette in the room too. There really was lots of space so would reccommend booking one of these rooms. We were on the 20th floor, but the lifts weren't as bad as what other reviews had stated so it was fine. The room was cleaned to perfection everyday,even with the mess it was left in every monring, they did an immaculate job!Great service! The receptionists were fine- we didn't have to deal with them that much really! It's in a fab location, and this is the main reason I would recommend it to people. There is a subway stop right outside the hotel, central park is a five minute walk one way, broadway the other and Times Square a ten minute walk, if not less! It really was fab! Fifth avenue was only a few minutes away too. It was just such a central location it made the hotel great. It is a little out-dated, but we weren't in the room that much apart from sleeping and getting changed! We also went to a NYE Party in the Gansevoort. It was very good, not great though!!We were expecting a huge deal to be made of NYE but there was literally a 10 second countdown, it was just a different option to standing otu in Times Square- the crowds were back to our hotel. All in all, a great trip. We visted from the 27th December to the 4th Jan, make sure to rap up warm, extremely cold -5 at one stage!! Thermal leggins and bodywarmers is the key :) Restaurants: We ate in a couple of different restuarants, Tao and Ruby Tuesday being too- both great service and great food, although we have heard to make reservations for Tao early to avoid disappointed.

Our room was 342, a corner room, with a view of the flag.The street noise wasn't too bad. I think what bothered us more was our neighbor who felt the need to open and close his door every morning numerous times. The Park Cafe that is connected to the hotel is pretty good. We had a late night snack here and were pleasantly surprised. There is also a Subway restaurant near the hotel that is open 24 hours in case you get thirsty or hungry in the middle of the night like we did lol!

The room is typical of New York accomodation, being small and cosy, but truth be said, our room was always warm and comfortable, and in minus 3 degree temps that was a huge tick for my wife and I. Bathroom: shower rose over the bath tub with a curtain only was ok, water pressure was by far the best i have ever experienced.

At this price the hotel has two thumbs up from us and should we revisit New York would be happy to book with Wellington again.

It just couldnt be better. Anyone who complains about this Hotel are only nit picking. Its impossable to get everything right al the time. I can honestly say this Hotel is tops. Ignore the little faults in decoration, you dont go to New York to stay in your room. We enjoyed a great night at Ellens Stardust Resturent on Broadway 51st Street. The Waiters and Waitresses are all actors and Actresses and serve your food singing and dancing. Its a must place to eat, Go there!!. Also Fluffys Cafe next three doors down on Time Square side is cheap and wonderful, a must for breakfast. The Greek Resturent in the Hotel is expensive but excellent, I had a wonderful chicken dish there. The Park Resturant also in the hotel is very good but expensive. We ate there several times and enjoyed it especially their French Toast and Bacon. Its a great hotel and reasonably priced for what services you get and location.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cI Love NW\u201d", "Author": "Lamper65", "ReviewID": "UR122626910", "Content": "My wife and I (62 / 67 ) stayed here on our first trip to New York in June 2011.

The hotel was really hot, air con was available but our one was really noisy so we put up with the heat. Mind you, it was 12 degrees at New Year which they probably don't expect! Park cafe was nice to eat in if you want to take your time for breakfast, otherwise for a quick in and out try Fluffies (very small but cheap). Would say to not go to Benash opposite as very pricey and not good service.

The rooms were very tired, the bed was old and uncomfortagle, the furniture and carpets were dirty and worn out, the heating 'clunked' loudly all night (\"Oh yes, we know about the heating sir, but you have to understand this is an old hotel...\"). The bathroom was old and dirty - black mould on the yellowing layers of sealant, the curtains were nailed to the walls to stop them falling down, etc. When we complained, the staff behaved as though it was a common occurrence and upgraded us to a Queen room which at least had a view of New York (instead of a brick wall), but which was only a slightly bigger version of the previous room. New York was full, so we had no options, but we dreaded coming back to the place - no lounge, no bar, no restaurant except for a sleazy and equally dirty 'greasy spoon' affair underneath the hotel where the staff were even more rude!!!

The rooms were very adequate for the price that we spent on them and they were always thoroughly cleaned every day. The best part of the Hotel is definately the location. You can very easily see on a map where a Hotel is but until you are actually staying here you can't appreciate how good the location is. Minutes walk to Central Park and minutes walk in the opposite direction to Times Square, Rockefeller is within walking distance along with Grand Central, Radio City. You are able to step out the side entrance of the hotel and almost fall down to the subway with N, Q, or R train taking you straight to 34th with Macy's, Empire State etc etc. Ideally I would look at eating at one of the thousands of restaurants that are dotted around New York and you are never too far from one rather than eating at the adjoining diner. Staff were very friendly in advising places to go, always willing to go that extra mile without being tipped at all and the porters were always willing to help. Price, location, quality, convenience all cannot be faulted. A+ in my opinion however you are always going to get snobs who expect a gymnasium, pool, sauna etc etc with slippers left at the side of the bed every night but with the place you get what you pay for and it's great value for money.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIdeal base for first visit\u201d", "Author": "EalingOtterman", "ReviewID": "UR121483554", "Content": "This is an ideal hotel for a first visit to this amazing city.

A little noisy on the lower floors due to car/taxi noise (everyone honks their horn), its part of their culture. The Park Cafe that is attacted to hotel is very good but if you exit the front of the hotel and head towards 8th Avenue anad 100 yards down 55th Street is Apple Jacks on the corner that is even better for breakfast and lunch. Best value breakfast isth Galaxy on 9th Ave. 46th stree in Hells Kitchen. Avoid Benash Bar and Deli outside the Hotel on 55th Street, poor food and vastly over priced. they survive on one time visits for not many go back.

A good tip do not book a ccruise for the Statue of Liberty for when you stop at Battery Park on the Downtown route get off and take the Staten Island ferry a 20 min ride to the island righ past the Statue, when you dock, get off walk back in the terminus and ride back all for FREE!

We gave up, shut the window and put the aircon on! Beds are comfortable with very clean bedding. The bathroom really is ridiculously small and I accidentally flooded the floor once when the shower curtain blew the wrong side of the bath :-( Towels are white and reasonably fluffy, there's some nice shampoo and lotion and the shower was efficient - apart from blasting the curtain over the edge... We ate twice in the connected diner downstairs and found it *amazingly* cheap for central NYC with very polite and friendly staff. Location really couldn't be bettered and this is why I would come back and stay in this hotel again. Right next to Carnegie Hall and 2 blocks from Central Park which was amazing on a really warm Sunday afternoon with many thousands of people out there enjoying it - people were like ants all over it!

It was an old wooden door, no crush bar, that opened into the hallway rather than into the stairwell. It had a small decorative handle that was hard to turn and no amount of tugging on it would get the door to budge. Felt like the handle might come off. I assumed it was locked.

I stayed there a week and it was occasionally open but any time it was closed it was impossible for me to open. Finally I reported it to the NYFD - maybe they'll do something about it.

We were treated very well, they clean up the room, no matter how late you start your day (this does not happen in Vegas). The rooms were more spacious than I expected given what I had read, but they are clean and we had a quiet corner away from most of the tours that stayed there that week. It is a European style hotel and room, not like the new modern hotels. It is a little run down, and you have to navigate your luggage around some stairs before you use the really old elevators. Nice to see a flat screen tv though (we had to keep the cabinet open with a chair in order that it not close). The location can't be beat if you are wanting to be close to uptown by Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Radio City, Letterman, NBC etc. It takes about 10 minutes to get to TimesSquare and the subways and buses are close. Don't hesitate to stay here unless you are into the finest hotels for big bucks.

Well on the Sunday night of the storm I was due to arrive in New York by train and my 17 year old son was supposed to arrive by plane from Central America travelling alone. I heard my train had been cancelled and so emailed the Wellington Hotel to let them know. Their chilling response was to say that if my son got there he could not register and enter our booked and paid for room because he was six weeks short of his eighteenth birthday. What did they intend to do with him? Send him out into the street during the hurricane?? Let him sleep in the foyer while our room lay empty upstairs? He does not carry a credit card so we arranged to cover this from his father still at home. This was still not good enough. In disgust we tried to cancel the room only to find they planned to charge more for the three remaining days of the stay than the four we had booked!!! My son diverted to elsewhere in the US, where a hotel despite being unaffected by the storm itself, took into account his disrupted travel plans and allowed him to check in - with a credit card authorisation from me. Meanwhile I got to New York the following day The room was old and tired with overfirm beds but had a great view. The reception staff were frosty and insisted on calling up 30 dollars on my credit card even though I planned to put nothing on the bill - ignoring the fact this would penalise me due to exchange costs. No free internet even to download boarding passes - found everywhere else. No -one bothered to explain how the pay per view internet actually worked - so someone already busy typing away had to show us. Staff stood around chewing gum. Any request from the staff for information lead to a bored shrug of the shoulders - a couldn't be bothered attitude.

I think it is important to realise that if you are visiting New York for a holiday then do you really want to spend too much on a hotel if you are not going to be in it? Good points: The location for a first time visit to NYC is perfect. I couldn't have wished for better. The staff were for the most part quite pleasant and very helpful if you wanted any information. They accomodated me for example when I wanted to check out at 1pm rather than 12pm. The room itself was fine although I didn't spend a lot of time in there! Bed was comfy, room was clean etc etc Bad points: My initial room was basic and didn't have bedside lights or a blind that worked. I then was moved to a different room which hadn't been finished so they upgraded me to King Size room which was great. I get the impression that they are very aware that it is in need of an update and are reacting positively to customer complaints to upgrade rooms on a daily basis. If you are a light sleeper then ask for a room which is not on the 55th st side as the rubbish lorry is quite loud early in the morning!!", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "melm05", "ReviewID": "UR116343427", "Content": "The Wellington is a not a posh NYC hotel, but it's clean, comfortable, and a great location.

Nothing went right from the time we checked in. We switched rooms 3 different times before finally giving up and accepting the poor accommodations given to us. The room we booked was a \"double\". Mind you, this is not 2 beds, but one full size bed that sleeps two people. We were told they \"upgraded\" us to a better room with a view. When we got to the room on the very top floor, it was small, the air didn't work and the bathroom was oddly positioned. By the way, it was 105 degrees...We asked for another room and was promply moved to another suite on the 8th floor with a king size bed. At first glance, it seemed ok, but again, the air didn't work and we never saw anyone on the floor with us. They had moved us to a part of the hotel that they had't even finished remodeling. it was completely deserted. Maintenance came to \"switch out\" the air unit so we left to give them time. When we returned, all electricity to the room was out. We couldn't see a thing. They didn't contact us or even leave a note on the door to let us know. So, we were moved again, to the 11th floor this time. Oh yeah, it was the only room left and it was on a \"smoking allowed\" floor. Neither me or my companion smoked. This room was just like the 1st room, except the air actually did work. They told us we could move in the morning if we still weren't satisfied. I told my companion \"what's the point. Apparently all the rooms look this way. At least this room has air.\" So we stayed. The elevators were slow and only fit 6 people at a time. There was no ice area on the floor. You had to go to the bell hop desk and request a bucket each time. The maid service cleaned the room each day, but we had to ask for towels. They took the used towels and didn't replace them. We signed up for internet service and was given a login name and password. I never even got to the site I was looking for because the service cut out. I called the front desk and they simply said...\"its been down for a while. I'm surprised you got on at all.\" We tried to stay away all day and just return to sleep. This place was a nightmare. On our last day, we checked out at 2am, had to catch a shuttle van and was rushing so we forgot our personal portraits we had drawn on the streets earlier. We tried to call and have someone get them out of the room before the maids found it and threw them away. I thought we could have them mailed to us. After all, they did have our credit card information on file. They told us to call back after 8am and someone would check. We called back several times between layover stops and got the runaround. Finally, by 10am, they said the room had been cleaned and they didn't find any portraits and the maid must have thrown them away. How could it be both. Did they throw them away or did they not find them. The whole time we were there, the maid service never showed up until after 11am. So, why on this day, had they already come and gone by 10am, found nothing, even after we had been calling since 2:30am to inform them that we had left something important in the room? It makes absolutely no sense to me. Why would they throw the portraits out or why would they keep them? The staff was simply not accommodating in the matter and could have cared less.

From here you can walk to Central Park, Times Square, Radio City, Broadway etc...so it is exactly where I wanted to be for the one night and the price was right compared to others in the same location. It is an older hotel that has a bit of a worn look to it but has all the amenities necessary for a pleasant stay. There is a large, active lobby with a gift shop and coffee shop restaurant. There are several \"pay per use\" computers along a wall in the lobby. Perhaps there is an overall \"budget group travel\" feel to the hotel. There are many bell hops/doormen to greet you and your car, take your bags etc...so service is not lacking. Looks like it may have been luxurious in it's hey day but a bit dark and worn looking now. Not dirty or anything just maybe dated and worn. The older elevators scared my kids as did the long narrow hallways with visible fire hoses and fire doors separating different areas. here was a vacuum cleaner sitting by itself in the hallway for hours. I thought it should have been put away. We booked a room with 2 double beds but were surprisingly upgraded to a huge two room suite! Our room was nicer than the hallway. Clean, comfortable and decently furnished and not scary. We did not see standard double rooms so can not comment. Also, I think there are two towers or sections to this hotel and that one may have been updated or refurbished. My guess is the section I was in was not refurbished recently. A huge negative was the heat in the room at night. It was so hot I felt like I was suffocating and could not sleep. And I found no way to turn the heat down or air conditioning on or up. I did not contact the front desk so maybe there was a way to cool down the room. I was only there for one night so I let it slide. Another negative was the noise from the outside. I know New York is noisy (I have been there and slept there many times) and it's to be expected but these rooms were definitely not well sound proofed from exterior noise at all. I have been to other hotels where I heard no noise at all and would not even know I was in New York. Not the case here. I heard all the construction and loud noises all night long (Probably because I was awake from the heat). So, I liked this hotel much more than my picky teenage children and I would stay here again but only if it is priced lower than other hotels in the area.

They arranged for a pull out bed to be taken to their room, but when they booked us in, we had a twin room. We swapped with mum and they had the two bed room, with a kitchenette, flat screen and nice bathroom. Our room had a king size bed, flat screen tv as well, and also a nice bathroom.

The hotel was 5 mins from central park one way, and less than 5 mins from Times Square the other way - you can see Times Square from outside!! The hotel is only a 30min cab ride (at a flat rate of $45) from JFK. The staff were very friendly as initially when they couldn't give my mum a twin room, they told her to come back in the morning as the hotel was full, and they would change her room for her no problem. The rooms were clean and tidy and the bed was very comfy. The rooms for both my husband and I, and my mum and brother were quiet as they were towards the back of the hotel (they were 12th floor round one side and we were 4th floor on another side of the hotel). We walked or used cabs to get to places and the prices were very very reasonable! I think it cost around $15 to get to the Statue of Liberty ferry and if that journey was done in England, it would have cost around \u00c2\u00a340 as it was about a 15-20 min journey!

We arrived mid afternoon, and the reception was busy, but quickly and easily checked in. The staff at Reception were very helpful, and gave us a warm welcome. Bellhops came and collected our bags and showed us to our room on the 21st floor. After reading other reviwes we were expecting not much from our room but we were impressed. Yes, the room was a bit smaller than a normal hotel in Europe, but there was still plenty of room to move about with 2 people. The room and bathroom were extremely clean, with towels changed daily, as well as the floor vacuumed daily as well. The window in the room was not designed to open fully, but it let plenty of air in as it was around 22 degrees the day we arrived. The first night we couldnt seem to get the roller blind to stay down, so we rang reception and asked if someone could just show us how it worked. Within 5 minutes a member of staff had come up and changed the blind completely! The only tiny downside I found was, if going to be picky, I wouldn't have classified the bed as being a double. We noticed in reviews that many people complained about noise and pipes, however, I can honestly say I did not hear any noise at all, not even next door! We did not try the restaurant attached to the hotel, instead we were regulars at Fluffy's cafe for breakfast, the pancakes are a must! The location of the hotel is excellent; turn right and you can see Central Park, and turn left you can see Times Sqaure.

This is my second time in NYC this year with a friend. I knew the location of the Wellington Hotel due to staying at the Park Central right across the street. We arrived at the hotel around 9pm on a Friday night, desite hearing that the check in process is a long winded ordeal, I was very suprised as we where the only two people there. There was an error with the booking of our room, instead of having 2 single beds, we where given one queen. The problem was quickly resolved as the hotel sent up a 'crib' or spare bed with the promise of moving into a new room the next day. True to their word, we checked out of our room and left out luggage with one of the porters and went out for the day, by the time we returned at 3pm a new room was waiting. We where situated on the 4th floor with a view of the Carnegie Deli, right about the hotel's cafe, the Park Cafe. How fantastic is was to wake up every morning to the smell of bacon and pancakes being cooked. Real America! The Park Cafe proved very popular, both with guests and visitors from the street. We had complimentry breakfast every morning and it was so busy we had to wait for a table, albeit not for too long...but it was worth the wait! As soon as we where seated one of the very friendly staff poured us fresh coffee, supplied us with a glass of water and some freshly squeezed orange juice. The menu consisted of an American breakfast - Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Home Fries or Ham. Pancakes or French Toast. Of all the places I've eaten breakfast at in the City, the Park Cafe serve up the best French Toast i've ever tried! Fantastic! The hotel is situated 3 blocks from Central Park, we where lucky enough to experience 28oC weather on the Monday, so we took to the park for an afternoon! Also, a 5 minute walk from Times Square and about 15 minutes from Hell's Kitchen. Also, the 57th St Subway was right outside the hotel so we didn't even need to walk far for that. Hotel room itself was very clean, comfy beds, brand new flat screen TV with cable, power shower and a very clean bathroom. Plenty of wardrobe space along with an iron and an ironing board, although the Hotel does offer a dry cleaning service if needed.

We stayed in the Wellington Hotel on 7th Avenue. If you are looking for absolute luxury then this is not your hotel, find a rediculously expensive one off of Time Sq.. However if you want a decent, clean, friendly hotel in a perfect location then this is the hotel for you. I usually find fault with hotels i stay in but i am really struggling to mark this hotel down. We orginally had a twin room however we were upgraded upon our arrival to a queen suite. The room was a good size with a nice clean bathroom and a comfortable bed. Really cant find fault with the room at all! Central park is a five minute stroll up the street and Time Sq the same in the other direction. There is a subway entrance right out the hotel which takes you to any of the other attractions which are a bit further away (ground zero, statue of liberty etc). Ive thought of one bad point and thats the lifts, if you stay at the Wellington you want a high level floor as at busy times (breakfast) the lifts gets full as you go down and the poor people on the lower levels would have to wait. I have read other reviews regarding the noise, yes you do hear traffic as you are in a busy city but this never effected me getting to sleep and i am a light sleeper myself. The diner next to the hotel is excellent and good value, the star dust diner is an absolute must if you are staying in New york (51st and 8th). Carnegie diner across the road is good for breakfast and if you like massive burgers \"counters\" near time Sq rocks. Avoid taking CDs off the black blokes even though they say its free...its not, they want a donation.. Tipping is a pain, they put gratuity on the bill and still expect a tip! Dont get into any taxis other than the yellow ones, they charge a fortune! Take Dollars with you as all the ATMS will charge you \u00c2\u00a31 everytime you make a withdrawal!

I checked into The Wellington yesterday. I have a corner room on the 19th floor. The room is very small, but it has all of the inclusions you would expect from a standard hotel room - internet, shower/bath, tv, desk, in-room movies etc. I like the feature of being able to open the windows and hear the sounds of New York. The windows open about 2 inches, although the bathroom one opens completely - enough to stick your head out and look side to side and directly 19 floors down to the street - so keep an eye on any youngsters to might like to climb up if you leave the window open. It is good to have the fresh air coming in though. It is the tail end of Winter / Early Spring here, with days of about 40 degrees F, but the rooms are heated way too high. It is currently about 35 degrees outside as I type this review, and I have all the windows open and the fan turned on - and it is just comfortable in the room (in shorts and a shirt). Check-in was smooth. Our bags were taken from the taxi to the check in area, and once checked in the bellhop showed us to our room. The process was smooth and without fuss. The hotel is in a good location - about a 5 minute walk from Times Square. It has several good food places within 1 block of each direction - including a breakfast place over the road that does 2 eggs, with toast and potato for $4.99. The only downside is that it is very noisy. There is a lot of hallway noise, and also noise from the pipes banging, air conditioners and heaters making weird noises throughout the night, and also street noise (although street noise is beyond the control of the hotel, so i cant hold that against them). Ear plugs are a must if you want a good sleep.

The reception was busy at all times during the day, we phoned if we needed anything as it was easier. The suite was quite big but was a little dated and could have done with refurbishing. The location was great, as you come out of the main entrance you turn left and you can see times square about 8 blocks away and to the right central park was about 3 blocks away. The subway system was great to get around but if you can walk do so as you can miss so much underground. My main gripe was the central heating system, ok if you go in the summer it should not be a problem but every hour on our first night when we were exhausted the central heating would kick in and start banging, it was as though someone was hitting the metal pipes with a hammer, and i mean a sledghammer. We complained and was told an engineer would look at it. This made no difference and the noise continued every night for our five night stay, some nights were better than others, depending on the temperature i would think. Would we go back again, good question.

All you really need from a hotel in NYC is a place to sleep because you hardly spend anytime at all in your room, but this hotel was lovely - had a very American feel and Art Deco Interior. We had a basic standard room with one double bed. The rooms were spacious, enough room to put suitcases, shopping bags whilst allowing two yound girls room to get ready for a night out! The bathroom was nice too, the only downside was that on the first couple of days our showers were cold but I suppose if we had complained they probably wouldve fixed it but everyday after that they were nice and warm. The room also had lots of wardrobe space and drawers as well as a plasma tv with films etc. The rooms were nice and warm so that was never a probably especially in Winter. The cleaned the rooms everyday and changed towels and bedding which was nice. The staff were very friendly and helpful, I've never been to a hotel were reception staff would go out of their way for you. Any question we asked they would take their time to give us as much advice as possible. The bellboys were always friendly too, telling you to have a nice day and if you need any help and they aren't looking for a tip. I think the best is Amando who asked if we needed a taxi back to the airport and said we could get one for $55 between us includig tis which i thought was great, anyway when we came to get in it he had ordered us a limo!!! And he expected us to pay $55 between us for nearly a 2 hour trip back to the airport (usually an hour but it was rush hour) and that made the perfect end to the holiday!He didn't have to arrange that but he did at such a cheap price! Also, if anyone is thinking of purchasing a New York Pass I would really recommend it. We paid \u00c2\u00a3125 for a 3day pass online, and we used at least $150 worth of attractions. Planet Hollywood is a couple of mins walk from the hotel so you can pick it up from there. It save queing, and gives you ore spending money! I can't comment on the restaurant as we never ate there, but this hotel was fantastic for location - couldn't fault it, 2 mins from Times Square and 2 mins from Rockefeller, Central Park, 5th Avenue and with the subway outside ith heads straight to Battery Park and Financial District.

We both agreed that we just needed a simple hotel to stay at and a bed to sleep in; we decided to stay at the wellington because it was the most affordable compared to the other hotels. Space: I expected a small room from reading the previous reviews, but even so, it was pretty small! We had one double bed, there is minimal room to walk around the bed and the bathroom was literally a toilet and a shower stall. So as far as space goes, I would not recommend this if you have more than 2 people, or if you mind the other person hearing everything that you do in the bathroom. Noise: I was unable to sleep the first night because the walls are paper thin that you can hear EVERYTHING that went on in the street, from construction trucks to horns to sirens an just crashing and banging. I've been to NYC 5 times now and I've never had that problem. The second night I bought earplugs which helped alot. CLeanliness: This was the worst part- the room was just not clean. I don't even believe that it was cleaned properly for us- here's why: There was hair left in the bottom of the shower when we got there. The sheets and towels seemed washed but all had noticeable stains ( I used a Tshirt as a pillowcase). On the day that we were checking out, we went to breakfast at the diner downstairs (which was awesome by the way) and came back to the room to pack. The bed sheets were already changed ( I knew this because the stained sheets were gone) and the bed was made. There were new toiletries in the bathroom. They did not do this after our first night stay, so the fact that they did this prior to our departure makes me think that they cleaned the room (by their standards) prior to our departure to save time and the next guests will arrive with the room in that condition. In summary, these were things I noticed but my husband did not. He compares it to a 2-3 star hotel in Europe. So, if you are there for a quick stay and want to save money, go for it. The location is great. Definitely eat at the restaurant downstairs- good food and prices much more reasonable than some of the diners down the street.

I found this stay disappointing. There was a general shabbiness about the place. It didn't help that when I arrived I found that the window shade in my room would not go down. Since the view consisted of a large bank of windows across a small alley, I was constantly on display for the people in that building for the couple of hours it took before anybody got around to coming to repair the broken shade. The bathroom faucet dripped, water came out from under the threshold of the bathroom door, the toilet flushed hesitantly. The worst problem (in my view) was that you have to pay a fee for (sluggish) wifi, even in the lobby, and then, to add insult to injury, if you have a computer but no printer, you have to pay by the minute to use one of the computers in the so-called Business Center in order to print boarding passes. I'm used to staying in hotels that offer free wifi, free printing of boarding passes, etc. I'm also used to staying in hotels with friendlier personnel. The Greek restaurant adjoining the hotel is excellent if you can manage to get a table. I succeeded one night by going *extremely* early. I failed another night even though I thought I was going early enough. Iow, don't count on simply walking from the hotel into the restaurant and being able to eat there. The one plus about the Wellington in my opinion is the location. If you're going to Carnegie Hall (which I was on this trip -- it's the reason I chose the Wellington), the location is close to perfect. It's also pretty good for many theaters. And there's a subway stop just outside the door, making it easy to go anywhere you want to go.

Other than this, the rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and the hotel staff (reception, concierge, bell boys and housekeeping) were all extremely helpful and polite.

We were shown to a room on the 4th floor at the front of the hotel and if the noise of the traffic on 7th Avenue had been the only problem we might have been OK. The bath was not only filthy but cracked, the WC pan was stained and it back filled whenever an adjacent toilet was flushed and the bathroom floor was sticky!! The bed cover was covered in dust which was surprising as when we ulled back the bed covers it looked as if someone had only just got out of it. The sheets were crumpled and stained. The bedroom carpet was also stained and the wardrobe (closet) was so filthy that we would not have wanted to put our clothes in it. I retirned to Reception to complain and was advised that they could not do anything as the hotel was full - amazing!! I then asked to speak to the Duty Manager who gave me the same line about the hotel being full, offerd us a free breakfast the following morning and suggested that someone from housekeeping would come to change the sheets although he didn't really think that there was a problem as \"we don't iron our sheets\". After a few seconds of throught we decided to check out immediately and then found that even the Yellow cabs wouldn't stop there.

I had contacted the hotel ahead to see if I could get flowers and champagne put in to our room as it was my wifes 40th Birthday trip. I also asked if they could do anything else for the special occasion and they advised they would attempt to give us a room upgrade depending on availability, at no extra cost. We were taken to our room on the 23rd floor which was nice enough, but very compact. From what the bell boy said I took this to be an upgraded room, I cant imagine what the standard rooms are like if this was the upgrade. It was well enough decorated, however the bathroom was ridiculously small- like a cupbooard! One day I was in the main lobby and went to go to the mens toilet, which was singosted for the 2nd floor, anyway I got lost and ended up in a corridor which I assume was offices or staff accomodation. The doors looked the same as the doors for the bedrooms, however the corridor was pretty grotty and made me wonder what the rest of the hotel was like. We did have a corner room which you could see Central Park from so that was a bonus and being on the 23rd floor the traffice was noisy enough, I would hate to think how noisy it would have been on the 2nd or 3rd floors. There were no coffee or tea making facilities in the room and no mini bar. We didnt book breakfast as part of our deal, which I was glad of becuase any time we passed the dining room/cafe it was overly busy and there was a very nice deli just across the road called Carnegies Deli, which was excellent for breakfast and reasonably priced- I would recommend it, the portions were big enough to set you up for the day. The best thing about the Wellington Hotel was the location, you go out of the main entrance and turn left, walk for less than 5 minutes and you are in Times Square, if you come out of the main entrance and turn right you can be in Central Park in around 5 - 10 minutes and on 5th Avenue (shopping) in around 5-10 minutes. So the location is perfectly placed, especially if-like us- you are only in New York for a few days. I have to say all the staff were very friendly and accomodating at all times.

Location - excellent. Very centrally located right above a subway and two blocks away from other lines. Delis and cafes around are open till late, you won't find yourself starving in the middle of the night. Located in the heart of Manhattan, Central Park, Times Square and Fifth Avenue are within a 2-3 block proximity, which is about a 10 minute walk away. Room - small, if you have a lot of luggage you might find it challenging navigating around the room. Having said that, there's a high price to pay for real estate in Manhattan and given the cost, I reckon it is not unreasonable to expect a small hole. Like the room, the bathroom is basic but acceptable. Towels are thin and of inferior quality but then again this isn't a 5- star abode. Cleanliness - decent but nothing to shout about, couldn't figure out if the toilet was leaking or the chambermaid had left residue from the cleaning liquid but dropping a line to housekeeping resolved it, if not permanently just temporarily, which was good enough for us. Service - average but again not one of it's selling points. Wifi accessibility - no free wifi in rooms or at the lobby. Have to pay for this. Telephone - we got charged for calling a toll free number. Were running late so didn't bother putting up a fight for 1.25. Other comments - this is a huge hotel with over 500 rooms, getting down during peak periods can be frustrating, there was one day where one of the three tiny elevators were not working and it took us about half an hour to get down with 6 pieces of luggage and with the help of the porter. Without the porter's help it might have taken an hour. I overheard a lady complain that despite walking down 27 floors she missed her tour group!

It could cause health hazards, let alone refusal to credit the account for measly $179.00 + tax. I file this report, reminiscent of uncivil society at Wellington Hotel, New York, NY At 2AM or earlier strong bang at and around the room began. It started light and grew stronger until it felt like a big boiler or some thing big would explode. And it continued again and again. It started and went away and came back. As it continued, I called front desk, which said there was no construction going on. I pleaded with the front desk to check it out, to no avail. I tried to sleep again and as I almost made it then the bang the thumping noise came back. It grew louder and more definite as danger. It was thumping noise that began and became louder and louder until it sounded like an explosion. I felt the explosion would cause the building to collapse and I ran as fast as I could. My heart began beating irregular and I was out of breadth. Finally I had to run out of the room 343 leaving behind luggage in the room. My reservation was made through Hotels.Com and paid in full for one night at the Wellington Hotel. Wellington offered me another room 8 times and I refused 8 times because I was shaken and shaking continuously. The offering was torture also.

After receipt of my incident report (verbally given), Hotels.com refused to refund my payment of $179.00 plus tax and said Wellington Hotel refused, also.

Best thing about the hotel: LOCATION! You really can't get any better than this. I've stayed all over the city (Grand Central Station, Chelsea, St. Marks, etc) and this is the best location with easy access to Central Park, Times Square, Columbus Circle, and there is a subway station literally right outside the door. At check in, the service was fast and they offered us a choice of one double bed (this is what we had booked) or two twins. We choose the twins as this would be more room for us! It made the sleeping arrangements much better!! Checking in took less than five minutes, and a bell hop took us up to our room, checked that the air was comfortable and that everything was clean/worked properly. The twin room we had did not have a refrigerator or coffee maker (I think the larger rooms do?) but had a large flatscreen tv, hair dryer, iron, ironing board. We never had to wait on the elevators as some previous guests mentioned. There are two sets of elevators, so I can only speak for the set we used, but it was always less than a 30 second wait! We were on the 17th floor. The room we had was, what I would call, normal sized. Not tiny like everyone has said. However, the bathroom was SO SMALL!!! There is a tub, sink, and toilet basically touching each other. It was fine for 4 days and for the two of us, but if you are a larger indivdual, it could get cramped. They should have put a shower stall instead of full tub for the small space... Anyways, the bathroom was very clean. Room was clean, too. Decor is dated (actually, I joked that the bedding and curtains have come BACK into style as my yellow purse matched the bedding, haha) but nothing bad enough for me to complain or go elsewhere because in all honesty, you DO get what you pay for in NYC and this bargain comes with being in an older hotel....it's worth it though if you want a bargain (remember: bargain+clean+LOCATION!) but pay a little more and go elsewhere if you want a modern, luxurious hotel with all the amenities. Hotel was quiet. I am a very light sleeper so every now and then I could hear the \"ding\" of the elevator stopping on our floor, but I don't think this would really bother anyone besides very light sleepers. I never heard other guests or traffic. Once I called for an extra pillow and the maid brought it within 5-10 mintues. Quick service! Checkout was easy, no problems, and took about two minutes.

I had requested to get a room on the third floor as to avoid using the elevator and I wanted a street view. Well I got the third floor but no street view. I could only see the other half of the building brick and the air conditioning system. As soon as I seen this I called the desk and requested another room. They told me there werent any rooms available on the third floor with a view until the next day, so we were moved the next day. The only thing I found odd was that we had to leave our room at 12 and leave our bags with the bellhop and that they would put our bags in the new room, but we couldn't actually check into the room until 3pm. When we got to our room at 3pm our bags were not there. I called and then they brought them up. I found this to most likely be a ploy for the bellhop to make their tips. If they had just dropped them off there would have been no tip. So I think of it this way if I had to leave my room at noon and couldn't go to my room until 3 then where is my reimbursement I paid to have a room for 24Hours and I lost three hours. Sure it was by my request but really it couldnt have been put in as a STAT clean? Also they really need to invest in an ice machine,it is especially annoying because it is the summer and ice melts fast. Also when I checked out and got my bill I had to remind her to give me my AAA discount. She said she did but I had to push the issue to get it cause I had already done the calculation and it did not match. So all that being said I thoroughly enjoyed my fabulous view. I could people watch from my room when my feet got tired of walking and I was relaxing in my room. The room was clean and sufficient. I wasn't going to be spending my vaca in my room so it was all good to me.

Don't eat in Lindy's just down from the hotel. Overpriced and food was average. You can eat in much better places. Try Angelo's an italian restaurant. Fab!

Only a few minutes walk from Times SQ, central park etc. We were abit worried because after we booked the hotel we read some poor reviews, but we arrived at the hotel and as soon as we got out of the shuttle bus the porters came over straight away to help is in the hotel with our luggage (very freindly staff). Got to reception staff on the desk were fantastic gave our details had to pay a deposit for each night we stayed which i think was about $30 which we got back when we left. The room we stayed in was small but that didnt bother us as when you go to New York you don't go to sit in your hotel room we literally was only in the hotel to sleep was out from 8am till very late at night (after all it is the city that never sleeps) The room was very clean and bathroom was to we had a huge tv as well and also a little room with ironing board, iron and somewhere to put on cases. Our room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels. The hotel is quite old fashioned but we loved it who cares about the decor when your in NYC.... All in all we had a brilliant experience at this hotel and would most certainly go back again. There was room service available but we didnt use we ate out the whole time but the restaurant underneath the hotel was always busy so the food must of been good. Word of advice if you do a open top bus tour don't use the double decker yellow new york taxi bus as we got on this took us round new york which was good we got off to go to the statue of liberty and was told it was a hop on hop off bus but when we came off the ferry from the statue of liberty there was no sign of these buses anywhere so we started walking didnt know how the hell we was going to get back to 58th street??? Luckily there was an old couple lost too so we all got on the tube together which was one hell of an experience its ok at peak times when people are going work etc but when we got on it-it was full of oddballs had some guy sat in front of us staring at us and writting stuff down...Very weird!!!!

I booked the Wellington Hotel for one night pre cruise and another booking for 4 nights on my return. I booked through Quikbook.com and everything appeared to work perfectly. I specifically choose quikbook as there cancellation policy meant no fees had to be paid. Due to the ash disruption I decided to cancel almost 9 weeks before we were due to stay at the hotel as it was looking like I would mot get going however nearer the time I decided to rebook my stay. The Wellington was only available for the post cruise stay of 4 nights so I made alternative arrangements for the first night and booked the Wellington for the later stay. I had received my confirmation emails that my original bookings had been cancelled and then a new email confirming my new booking. Whilst on the cruise I happened to check my credit card statement and the Wellington had charged me for the first night I assumed this had been an oversight and called to arrange a refund however when I phoned the guy in reservations said it was a \"no show\" and the reservation had been charged. I explained that I had cancelled via quikbook and had the cancellation email which I could forward; but was told this was no good and the room was charged as a \"no show.\" Despite trying to explain the situation again after almost 20 mins I was told there was nothing they could do, if I got quikbook to fax the cancellation through they would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvestigate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a possible refund. Alarm bells rang in relation to my other cancelled booking so I asked him to confirm if the 4 nights I had originally booked had been cancelled and that only one booking under the new reservation number remained. The guy confirmed I had only one booking under the new reservation number. However he was unable to explain why one of the original bookings had been cancelled and not the other, despite both being done at the same time. I then phoned quikbook to try and resolve only to be told by the woman on the phone that she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find my booking despite supplying her with my name, email, booking references, dates of booking etc. so as the situation stood I had quikbook unable to find any of my 3 bookings yet the Wellington had received all three and but only one cancellation. I immediately contacted my credit card company and outline the situation, they explained they could dispute the transaction and as long as I had email copied of my booking and cancellation I would be refunded whilst they sought a refund. I was therefore satisfied that I was not being to be out of pocket and decided to leave the matter until I reached the hotel. Nevertheless I was not satisfied with the situation and decided to phone the hotel once again to confirm the booking for my arrival. I got through to a girl in reservations -Lisa- who was very helpful and when I explained the situation she told me she would contact me within an hour after she had spoken to quikbook. True to her word Lisa contacted me within the hour and apologised explaining there was an error in the system and my first booking would be refunded and the second booking was actually still in place but she would cancel it so all that remained was a single booking for 4 nights. I was very pleased with the service I received from Lisa and found her very helpful and pleasant however the fact that the initial reservations person had told me the second booking was cancelled when it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t means that I could have also faced double charges for the 4 night stay. Moreover I subsequently received confirmation from quikbook that they had 2 confirmation of cancellation emails from the hotel 13mins after my cancellation. On arrival at the Wellington we were told our room would be ready by 14.00 which was fine as we had arrived earlier than expected. As I was travelling with my sister we had booked the one bedroom suite as it had a kitchenette and 2 separate rooms which would allow us to prepare breakfast, evening snacks etc. Once we received the key we were impressed with the size of the rooms however the kitchenette consisted of the microwave and one cup. No plates, cutlery, kettle, toaster etc. Considering the suit is meant to be suitable for 4 people I was shocked to only have a cup. We asked for another cup and were brought 2 glasses. We asked for a kettle and were told they would try to find one. To be honest the microwave was a bonus (not that we used it) but the basics of cutlery, plates and a kettle \u00e2\u20ac\u201cand even a toaster, I would have expected considering we paid extra for the faciliaties. The saving grace of this hotel is undoubtedly its location mins from central park, shops etc. however the needless hassle pre stay and the fact that the suite and its kitchenette were so spartan left me feeling a little short changed. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend the suite or to book this hotel with quikbook.

Each room had it's own TV, which was an added bonus as I didn't have to watch Sponge Bob! The location of the hotel couldn't be better - step outside the door and there are several delis, a Starbucks, bars and a mainline Subway station. Central Park is a couple of blocks north, Times Square just several blocks south, and we were only minutes from the shops on 5th Avenue. Yes, we did experience the occasionally sharp bellboys, but I can only put this down to them being busy and stressed! Anytime we called down to reception with a request (my parents needed a kettle, and one morning a fuse blew in our room) somebody came straight away to help us. And yes, the rooms are a bit small and hot, but the air conditioning worked a treat. This is New York, nobody really spends that much time in the room anyway, and the location far outweighs any minor niggles.

This is a no frills hotel. Nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable. I booked a room through Priceline, and although I booked a queen bed, if we wanted an early check in (we had early flights in), we could settle for a double.

We spent the day sight seeing and on return to the hotel at 11.30pm I pulled back the bedding and was disgusted to find the bed linen had not been replaced since the previous nights guest had slept on it. The sheet was wrinkled on one side and to add insult to injury there was a pubic hair on the sheet. Disgusted I called the front desk to be told that fresh bedding would be sent to the room - that took 45 minutes !! As I removed the bedding to replace it ( the fresh bedding was not only too small, not ironed and also had hairs on it) I discovered that the quilted mattress protector had a urine stain on it. We threw all the bedding on the floor and spent the night sleeping with the one clean sheet as our only cover. When I complained in the morning we were given a refund of $40 - better than nothing but a full refund would have been more suitable in the circumstances - do you know anyone who would pay to sleep on a strangers urine or pubic hairs ??

It's 2 blocks away from Cenral Park and about 10 blocks from Times Square, but you do want that. It's a 10 minutes nice walk at maximum, and you skip the frenzyness of being into Times Square, which I'm not sure it's a good option. That's why I had always chosen Wellington... untill NOW. One of the problems: BEDROOMS. Some COUPLE bedrooms are really nice, and most of them are resonable and acceptable for such a crowded and expensive city like New York/ Manhattan. Problem is if you are with a friend and want a twin bed. The twin bed rooms SUCK HARD. IMAGINE CROWDED - VERY CROWDED ROOMS. If you're out for shopping (most of us are in NY, don't we?), there's no place for you and your luggage in the room. It's an exercise of logistics and there won't be any place left for circulation or even cleaning. You can choose Queen Bed room - allright - there are nicer ones - but isn't this hotel already overpriced??? Bathroom - another problem - mine was so crowded that I couldn't even open the toilet with taking the toilet paper out of the support - if you can believe that! Only when the paper was half used, the toilet would open properly - hehe this was surely someone's joke. There's no space for anything besides you and one personal item at a time at the twin room bathroom - any woman would surely hate that. Baggage is always a problem here. There are LONG LINES - REALLY LONG - to leave baggage in the store room and take them out, the lobby is always extremely crowded, lot's of people hanging in every place. My gosh, it's a hell inside. As usual in NY, all works much better with good tips. No tips in hand, and the bel men staff can be VERY RUDE - even agressive.

Also have 2 large LCD TV's in each room, which is nice (although, what are you doing watching TV when you're in NYC?). Con's - The service is staggeringly weak. > the receptionists are reasonably helpful, however the porters and the concierges need classes in customer service, badly. They all look shabbily turned out and un-approachable, and were usually surly when you did speak to them. The final straw was when they blatantly tried to hustle my friends and I with largely inflated taxi fares to the airport - \"85 dollars to JFK, you won't find it any cheaper than that for 5 people, the taxi driver would lose his license'. It's just a shame we were well aware that in a yellow cab it's a flat fee of $45 between JFK and anywhere in Manhattan. - The quality of the rooms is questionable. >the rooms are generally run down, although clean. The 3 rooms we had between us all suffered the same issues with the plumbing in the bathrooms - the showers were either non-functional or scaldingly hot no matter which taps you turned. >the views in all 3 of our rooms was laughably bad.

The lifts in this building are ridiculous for the volume of people using them, and on no less than 4 occasions did other guests (and once staff) rudely comment on us for having the temerity to call the lift to get to the lobby.

Reasonably sized room, standard en-suite sized bathroom and large closet but the best bit was the balcony, on stepping out and looking to the left you could see straight down Seventh Avenue/Broadway to the bright lights of Times Square and look to the right to the calmness of Central Park, absolutely wonderful and we couldn't of been happier. Room was warm, comfortable, decor was not modern but what I would expect decor in an American hotel to look like. Bed was comfortable, shower was hot...what more do you need?! The Wellington is actually situated near to the more luxury hotels such as The Ritz, The Hilton and The Plaza nearer Central Park. Our favourite places to visit were Central Park, Times Square, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. Favourite places to eat were Stage Deli - a real typical American deli restaurant on Seventh Avenue close to Wellington, highly recommended. After a recommendation from friends to eat at Bubba Gumps we ate there during the week, you'll be lucky to get a table at the weekend, its heaving and queues lead out the front door - food was nice but service was very rushed, the mains were brought to the table before we had finished the starters and we were disappointed by this and therefore feel we didn't get value for money. The diner at the hotel was very reasonably priced and breakfasts were really tasty - go on and try the pancakes with bacon and maple syrup, surprisingly tasty but very filling! To get around the city we used the hop on-hop off sight seeing bus on a 48 hour ticket - good value and an easy way to get around the city and have the benfit of a tour guide along the way - the guides on the bus are really helpful when you want to get off and will happily point you in the right direction to where ever you want to go. Overall we had a fantastic trip, NY was everything we expected and we would definitely go back again staying again at the Wellington.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, best location you could ever hope for!!\u201d", "Author": "Agentblond", "ReviewID": "UR60121434", "Content": "I booked a trip to NY as a wedding gift to my husband and chose The Wellington after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and hearing all about it's great location - the people were not wrong!!

I had read some reviews prior to booking it...so I pretty much knew what to expect. The hotel is an older hotel. Rooms are very basic (we did not have a fridge etc either). The location is fantastic though! Only 5 min walk to Central Park, Carnegie Hall, 10-15 min walk to Times Square and Broadway shows. The service at the hotel was good. I had specifically booked 2 beds but ended up with 1...so my son had to sleep in a cot (that was brought up promptly). We asked to switch to a room with 2 beds (there was nothing available for 2 days), but we had a reminder call on the 2nd day, that we could move that day. Toilet backed up twice, we had someone up to fix it immediately, the room itself was very hot, so we had someone up immediately to turn the heat off (old style heating too - which could be noisy at times). The cafe in the hotel had the fastest service I have ever seen. Literally, you had your food within 5-8 minutes after ordering. The prices were not cheap though.... a very small glass of orange juice was $5.00 or a plain burger with nothing on it, no fries etc was $7.25. I found the food okay. We only ate there a few times. We found a lovely little restaurant, Luigi's a couple blocks over for great inexpensive italian food - a huge lazagna was $8.00 with garlic bread...and their pizzas were enormous with huge chunks of food on them. So make sure you check out the areas off the beaten path for less expensive restaurants. The street vendors also have pretty good food for only $5-$6 per meal. We were able to check out the night before, due to having to leave at 4am, without any hassles. Staff were helpful and courteous. There are computers in the lobby for internet access. It's $1.00/5 mins. It was nice to have. The doorman and concierge staff were helpful and nice. Rooms for the most part - at least what we stayed in - were small, but you don't spend much time in them anyways. Bathroom and the towels are small too! The price and location were really good!

Always pleasant. Never waited more than 5 minutes either time. We did not use their parking because I found a garage a block away for $25.00 a day. We also did not eat there because we brought our own food for breakfast and snacks thanks to having the kitchenette. Also we were gone each day from 8:30am until late in the evening. The location is also excellent. 2 blocks south of Central Park and a quick walk from Times Square. The rooms were cleaned each day. No complaints.

The Beds were extremely comfy and the room was nice and warm considering it was -9 one night. Having the cafe bar down on the ground floor, for us, was great because i will warn you DO NOT ASK FOR A COFFEE MACHINE AT RECEPTION! Yes, you will get a coffee machine....but nothing else lol. We personally found it funny and it was a harm for us to go down int he morning and grab a coffee from the cafe. The hotel was decorated beautifully with Christmas decs (which was nother question in Time Square ect) The only WARNING i have about this hotel is WATCH THE SHOWER TEMPERATURE! We both complained about this as we (me and my mum) both got burnt from the shower! For us, a hotel is to wash and sleep and thats what the welington did for us. Two mins walk from time square one way and central park the toher, what more can you ask for? New York: Hmmmm, had a great stay but i wouldnt advise anybody to go over Christmas if you love that Christmas feeling.... Not one decoration until Bryant Park and the Rockafella centre...yes the ice skating but still playing classical music in the background? The empire state building is a must do however! and looking for somewhere to eat? go to 2nd or 1st Avenue, they have plently of restaurants and very well priced. On christmas eve for a meal we paid only $45 dollars for two of us with wine and it was fantasic. Just a two min walk from the hotel there is a Irish pub, simply called 'The Irish Bar' with good beer, good food and friendly service (exp. Cyril). Fantasic Karaoke Bar on....not sure... if you ask and quote 'where the 'famous' bodyguard' is', that is also a great night out! The shop in time square 'M+M's' is AMAZING!!! It kept me occupied for hours on end! THEATRE TIP: Everybody raves about going to time square to get theatre tickets, DONT! Go into the actual theatre it works out much cheaper! Time Square were asking for $95 each to go and see 'Next To Normal', at the theatre it was $47 each. One more thing! there will be guys on the street who will try and sell you tickets for the 'comedy club' for $10each, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!

It is a few yards from Carnegie Hall, 1/2 block to David Letterman's theatre, 1 block to Central Park, 1/2 block to the Russian Tea Room, and a fairly cheap taxi ride to anywhere you want to go on Broadway. If you have more money than brains you can walk to the shops on 57th, which include Bergdorf-Goodman and Tiffany's. We chose a 1-bed suite at the back of the hotel, which had no view, but because it was off-street, was a sensible trade-off. It was extremely quiet, with a beautiful marble bath, terrific water pressure, a clean, quiet suite with bedroom, living room, and kitchenette with fridge, sink, and microwave. Doormen and concierge desk were helpful with maps and information. Heating system was a little loud, but this is the case in many of these old buildings. Wifi is extra. Cafe in the hotel is used by everyone in the neighborhood so it is often busy with line-ups. Walk around the hotel a block or two and you will find coffee/bagel/sandwich outlets cheaper than the cafe in the hotel. (This is good advice no matter where you're staying in New York!). The hotel's evening restaurant is a dark, greek-styled old fashioned affair with velvet chairs, off the main lobby. This hotel would be difficult for the handicapped, as there are alcoves and secreted hallways with 1/2 floors with steps leading up or down almost everywhere in the hotel. Both the cafe and the restaurant are high-priced, and are capitalizing on the tourists. Literally, next door, a few feet outside the hotel is a Subway, several street vendors, and a Starbucks across the street, all of which were doing a brisk business from the many hotel patrons in the area. Our hotel also had a hair salon, well-stocked tuck shop, room-service menu, and a tv in both the bedroom and the living room. There was speedy response from the desk if you had questions or problems with heating or housekeeping issues, which proved to be slow. Most housekeeping personnel in New York hotels do not speak English, so don't expect too much. Oddly there was a coffee maker in the kitchen, but front desk reports they no longer provide coffee...so we did without. Go figure. At $161/night we didn't complain about this. We used www.hotelhotline.com to book the Wellington Hotel. Note, there is a nightly surcharge plus wifi costs. Weekends can be higher.

I was very pleasantly surprised when we got to the hotel- from the outside it looked quite posh, and the reception/lobby area was lovely, with a big christmas tree :-) There were 3 lifts that I saw, (may have been more, I didn't look further than the lifts we used..) and we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for one, and that was at checking in/out times. The room was bigger than I expected- a double bed and still plenty of floor space. It also had a big widescreen tv although I barely watched it as New York has so much to do that we were hardly in the hotel! The bathroom was small, but the shower was powerful- essential when you've been out in the cold all day :-) The maid changed our towels every day, not sure how often the bedding was changed as the bed was always re-made perfectly and looked clean lol. Only thing is- no kettle! I missed my british cups of tea while I was over there but if that's my biggest complaint then I think that says a lot about how great our holiday was! The staff were really helpful- booking us a car to the airport, helping my boyfriend find a plug adaptor... everyone who worked there seemed to have a good attitude. I can't really fault this hotel- for a 3 star hotel I would say it seemed worthy of a 4 star status.

To say we had a fantastic time would be an understatement. Having read some of the reviews on this site, I was more that a little nervous about what to expect from our hotel but it proved to be quite the opposite. From the moment of our arrival everything went according to plan. The staff were very friendly (with perhaps one exception- the night concierge on our second night, was having a conversation on the phone and ignored me for 10 minutes until I gave up and went to bed!!! However everyone else on this desk was more than helpful for the duration of our stay and compensated for his rudeness. The concierge even organised our trip to Woodbury Common!!! He suggested that we use a private transfer with another small group the cost of which was $3 more than the bus from the Port Authority. This proved to be the Best Idea of the trip. The driver brought us to the door of Woodbury at 10am and collected us at the pre arranged time (6pm) and delivered us and all our shopping directly to the door of the hotel!!! The best idea ever!!!! While our double double room was not very big it was larger than I expected and was very clean. The Bathroom was very small, but adequate. It was very central, 4 blocks below Central Park(we took a Carriage Ride at night and were delivered back to the door!!) and 8/10 above Times Square. Our room had a great view of Times Sq but was far enough away to escape the noise and neon lights. I cant speak for the bar and restaurant as we did not get the opportunity to try them!! But also attached to the hotel you will find the Park Cafe. The food here was good. (even at midnight after the carriage ride!!!) I have no complaints about The Wellington, maybe we were lucky. (I might not have been as happy if we had rooms at back of hotel) But for location and value, I don't think you could beat this hotel.

New York hotels are expensive, but for $399 per night, my expectations were somewhat higher than the stay provided by The Wellington. In terms of value for money and calibre of accommodation, The Wellington is simply the worst hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever visited. My comments are consistent with other recent reviews. Our fourth floor room was extremely depressing: small, with tired, out-of-date d\u00c3\u00a9cor, poor furniture (notably a very small double bed) and with none of the standard facilities that you come to expect in most average modern hotels (for example, coffee/tea making facilities). There was, however, an iron provided in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a minor upside. The room had air conditioning, but not of a sophisticated nature. The window had been nailed open, and the AC unit was simply jammed into the open part of the window, with thin plastic boards either side (to close the room off from the elements). The upshot of this arrangement was that there was no noise protection from the streets below. Police sirens, garbage trucks, late night revellers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of these and more meant that sleep was impossible to achieve. The only revealing characteristic to the hotel is its location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right on 7th Avenue and near to Central Park. There are many better hotels in New York that are similarly priced. We stayed in the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers for the following four nights, which was much, much better. Reading other reviews for this hotel, it would seem that if you get a suite, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re OK.

Few tips: We used every day for breakfast Fluffy's Cafe is on the 7th ave one block away, very good prices and lovely food and nice people there and for the dinner different restaurants (there are 100s) but the best one was John's Pizza on the number 260 44th st for pepperoni we paid 15 and it was small one but very big...its New York we talking about so meal portions are huge there..lol Last thing its very good to buy 2days plus 1free tour bus for 86dollars from citysights NY there is web http://www.citysightsny.com/ and u can save loads money.

Also we had two beds instead of 3 and we had a terrible bedsofa with a thin matress. The sheets were stained and there were dead insects on them! It was awful and no matter how tolerent we are, this was just a bit too much. I went down and complained about the sheets. The girl in the reception told me: we don't iron the sheets here so it's normal if they are wrinkled! I said they are stained and they sent someone and changed the sheets. Also i went down and complained that this is NOT an upgrade and that we paid for 3 beds and not for 2. After this they said they will change our room the next day.

The room was from 1940 at best and not in a good way, more like where Stanley lived in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". I think, who cares! We just need a place to plop our heads inbetween all the stuff we were planning. So, it is a huge room for any standards. But, the double bed was sagging to the floor before I sat on it.

I gave him the standard tip for our bags and he rolled his eyes at me and left the room. I am not a cheap tipper! The shower was wet when we arrived.

We booked this hotel through a travel agent in Britain and paid in cash upfront in the August as we travelled in the October. The agent booked through a second agency based in USA. In March this year (2009) our credit card was debited with the amount for our hotel bill - we were not infromed that this was going to happen. On enquiring it appears that the hotel was not paid by the 2nd agency for our booking.

It was a bit out dated and some of the wallpaper was peeling off. The bathroom was basic and again could have done with some updating. The room however had air con which was great because it was quite sticky and humid out. The room was quiet enough to get a good nights sleep when the window was shut. Our only complaint was when we left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door, the housekeeping maid opened our door and quickly shut it. We then had a phonecall asking if we wanted service. I'm sure that's what the 'do not disturb' sign means. Another day we heard the door being fiddled with and when we opened it, the maid said 'I was just checking'. Checking for what I don't know. There is a subway station right outside the side entrance to the hotel on 55 street. The lobby area was lovely. I don't know if I would stay here again because I like to try lots of different hotels. In summary as a base for all sightseeing/shopping it is a great location.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cThe best holiday ever!\u201d", "Author": "El1Yorkshire", "ReviewID": "UR33120848", "Content": "This hotel is in an amazing location, a 5 minute walk to central park, right next to broadway and times square, ten/fifteen minute walk to the main shopping district. Also if you wanted to go on the big apple tour, which take you to all the main sightseeing locations, the bus stop is right outside the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially the people in the shop who told us all the best places to visit. You could also book theatre and sightseeing trips here. We flew to Newark airport, so it cost us about sixty dollars in a taxi, which wasn't too bad as it was quite a long drive. On our return journey the hotel sorted us out with their own personal airport service, which i would reccommend. It cost us the same price as the taxi, yet a much more comfortable and cooler journey. The hotel was very clean, and the double room was just the right size. we couldn't really figure out how to work the heating/air-con. so the room did get quite warm on a night time. Yet we couldn't open the window as it was very noisy outside. This is to be expected really, after all it is new york, the city that never sleeps. We didn't eat in the hotel so couldn't really comment on that, but the cafe attatched to the hotel seemed very popular. We did hear that it was quite expensive though. We went to a smaller cafe down the road, which did the most amazing bagels for breakfast. Also there is a subway sandwich shop just down the road if you want to buy some dinner to take and eat in the park. Overall this hotel is definatly value for money. It is in a brilliant location and is very clean and comfortable. I would deffinatly recommend staying there. Also after returning home we have spotted the hotel in various films, Borat being one of them.

The many people waiting in the lobby were evidence that my room was not the only one unready. The hotel insists on having a bellman escort you to your room. With virtually everyone using wheeled luggage now, we can easily pull our bags to our rooms, and most of us know how to count. Let's see, Room 334 must be on the third floor, and I bet it is between Room 333 and Room 335! The outdated bellman system slowed the check-in process even more, as everyone had to wait their turn to be shown to their room. And of course, everyone had to tip the bellman.

If your looking for somewhere safe and central to stay and your not overly bothered about luxury or cost then this is the place for you. Im not the complaining type but I had a few issues with this hotel however they were all resolved without any problems. I arrived at the hotel with my wife and 6 month old baby and check in was quick and efficient. However when I opened the door to my room I had a shock, it was tiny and barely big enough to fit the smallish double bed in never mind a crib or indeed our luggage. Now when I say it was small i mean ridiculously small even a single adult would have had problems moving around the room. I immedietly went to reception and told them that the room was too small for adults and a baby and to my surprise the changed it immedietly without question. What worried me was that it was almost as if they were expecting me to complain and perhaps they had put me in that room as we had just arrived from a long journey from the UK and would possiby be to tired to complain. The second room was perfect, it was large and roomy and had a flat screen televison and modern bathroom. After an evening out exploring central park we returned to our room but unfortunately our crib for the baby had not materialised. I spoke to reception and they said they had no record of any request for a crib but luckily I still had a copy of my email request and conformation at hand. Once again this was delt with quickly and with minimum fuss and the crib arrived at the room within 5 minutes. Our next day in New York, Saturday the 25th April was one of the warmest April days in history with temperatures reaching 34c, not surprisingly our room which had no air conditioning was like an oven. I was worried about the baby as the temperature in the room was 30c, much higher than what he was used to so i enquired at the reception about the possibility of getting some sort of fan for the room. When i returned to the room and opened the door (in under 5 mins) there was already a chap fitting some sort of extractor fan/air conditioning unit to the window of the room. I couldnt fault that for quick service and the unit worked perfectly allowing us to set the temperature to 18c before we left to go out.. All in all the hotel is fine if just a little bit old and worn, because of this it seems that the staff are well used to dealing with complaints, changing rooms etc etc. Also is worth pointing out that when i enquired about wireless internet i was told it would be in the region of $40 for my stay, when i told them that at that price i wasnt fussed to my surprise they told me they would give it to me for free! The floor staff in the hotel are informal and friendly and are helpful when recommending bars and restaurants in the area. I wanted to watch an English Premiership football match and was advised to go to the imagitively named \"Irish Pub\" a few doors down which was perfect as it showed several matches live on its multitude of big screens.

After checking in (receptionist said she was upgrading us to room with a king bed), we followed her directions to what appeared a different part of the hotel. In the lobby there were elevators which appeared to access the front portion of the hotel. Our room on the other hand was located back in the \"east wing\" which was down a hallway where we had to take steps down to an empty , less busy part of the Hotel. There were 2 elevators which carried us to the 7th floor...room 76 to be exact. The carpet in the hallway was dirty, stained and there was a stale smell on the entire floor. The carpet inside of the room was stained and the bed was a king was rather dated. Other items that caused concern was that the bathroom faucet continued to constantly drip, and the air conditioning didnt work. I had to call room service to ask for towels (no towels when we arrived) and for someone to fix the air conditioner. The view out of the window was really no view at all.

I wanted the best location at the lowest price for clean & comfortable accomodations. I read the reviews about this hotel, & like many others was a bit hesitant because of some of the negative comments. But by gut instinct I went ahead & booked the hotel. We were not disappointed. It was an excellent base to enjoy the city. Our room 2242 was clean & comfortable with a double bed & 30\" flat screen TV. It faced 7th ave. The decor was dated circa 70's but we thought that was great. The room was small, but we expected that. The bathroom was very small with shower & pedestal sink- that was the only negative in our eyes. Elevators were small but there were three in our wing & were fast enough not to have to wait long to get up or down. The lobby was large but it is a bigger hotel than it looks & was busy in the day. There are 5-6 pay per use computers with printer in the lobby & wireless if you have your laptop. This location doesn't get any better- subway R W just outside the 55st. side door, 2 blocks north to Central Park, 3 blocks south to the theater district & Times Sq., 6 blocks southeast to NBC 30 Rock Radio City, famous Carnegie Deli across the street (excellent Pastrami & cheese cake- open to 3am). Hot tip: \"Hidden hotspot\" if you're on a budget or getting tired of restaurant dining, across the street from the hotel, next door to the Carnegie Deli is the 55th St. Deli which is open 24 hours. This was our favorite place. Its like a convenience store with a 20' salad bar/hot food steam table down the center. The salad bar was super fresh with sooo many types of greens it was unbelievable. The hot entrees were just as great. It was $6.99 a pound. There's also a sandwich/fry cook ready to custom make any sandwich from paninis to hamburgers. Good hot coffee anytime (not as strong as Starbucks & weak as 7-11s). They even have fresh fruit & Gelato. We got exact portions that we wanted & went back to the room to eat but there is a small counter with 3 seats if you want to eat there. If you are going to the Statue of Liberty for the first boat out (9am) & need to leave the hotel early, you can get your lunch here & backpack it- we did.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Douglasville, Ga.", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased....\u201d", "Author": "AtlantaBry", "ReviewID": "UR29474469", "Content": "My wife and I spent our 1st anniversary @ the Wellington and really enjoyed it.

It was very loud and the room remained stuffy and the curtains/blinds did not shut. The bathrooom was dated but clean. They provided lots of toilet paper, shampoo, face wash, shower wash and body lotion. There seemed to be water around the loo but we wasnt sure if this was from the loo or shower.. however we didnt report it as we were only there to sleep for two days and didnt get round to it.

The location is wonderful and staff were really friendly & attentive. The hotel was completely booked & somewhat of a madhouse, but the staff handled themselves quite well & professionally. We were in the East Wing & the layout was a litte strange, but it is an old bldg (had to go down a hallway, down a few stairs, then back up agan). Fair warning - the elevators are VERRRY SLOW and SMALL. If you're a family/group with a lot of luggage, you'll have to take separate elevators or make multiple trips because you won't all fit. The attached restaurant, Park Cafe, is WONDERFUL. A lot of \"hotel restaurants\" aren't that good unless they're at a 5+ star, however this was a happy exception. A cab from Penn Station was less than $7 (+ tip) & it's very close to everything (located on 7th Ave @ 55th Street. It's only 4 blocks north to Central Park, 2 blocks north to Carnegie Hall, and maybe 10 short blocks to Times Square. I was able to easily walk to Rockefeller Center for a Today Show taping as well. E/B/D trains are outside the hotel door, and N/R/Q/W two blocks up. A few of the POSITIVES of Welllington include: + Excellent location. Close to every major attraction. If this is your first visit to the city, it's a great \"center,\" with easy subway access & several restaurants & deli's nearby. + Very comfy beds and spacious rooms (at least the 1br suite was). + Great water pressure; rare in buildings of this age. + No paid mini bar in the room! There was a small dorm-size refrigerator to put your own snacks & drinks in, but at least it wasn't one where you're charged almost as soon as you remove an item as in other hotels. + Excellent staff. They will also hold our bags if you arrive before checkin or need to leave it if you're flight doesn't leave til later in the day. ((typical 3:00pm checkin & 12:00 noon checkout)). + Gift shop on site where you can get tickets to most all nearby attractions, sometimes discounted a little (not much, but every dollar counts on vacation, right?!). + Wonderful on-site restaurant, Park Cafe'. This is also where room service comes from. + Nice bathroom with plenty of towels & such, and a long shelf to place toiletries. Yes it was somewhat small, but it's NYC people - you can/should NOT expect a big one. That said, it was actually a pretty good size for the city. + Iron & ironing board in the room. Also, a hair dryer in the bathroom. + Extra pillows provided in the closet, so no need to call housekeeping. A few of the NEGATIVES of Welllington include: - They automatically apply a $25 charge to your CC for incidentals & tell you you should see it come off in 5-10 days after you check out. Just didn't like the fact that it takes that long to remove the charge. - Slooooowww, small elevators. We were on the 2nd floor so we just took the stairs. - No information on area attractions & restaurants. Would have been nice to have a info packet with area restaurants that deliver if you didn't want to get out, especially if you aren't familiar with the city. There was one book in the room, but it was your basic tourist book you can get at the bookstore, just with a Wellington cover (and a note that said if the book was missing you would be charged $25). - Not much hot water. Water pressure itself was awesome, but hot water was more difficult to get, and to keep once you managed to get it. It averaged luke warm, so at least you weren't stuck with a cold shower! - No late checkout option. Reception did say that was a possibility if they weren't full, so if you hit it at the right time, you may be able to opt for that (not sure of the charge though). I have a feeling a \"regular\" room is small, but that's typical for any \"avg\" NYC hotel. Not sure why people complain about it so much, especially when they have this site to refer to. I'm pretty sure it would be no less comfortable though...and that's what's important after walking the city all day right?

Also, the shower water would come out scalding hot every minute or so during the shower so you had to be quick to dart out of the way or get first degree burns!

We were given our room key, so we decided to walk around New York and get our bearings. Came back a few hours later, to a very clean and well presented room. TGrue to their word our cases were in the closet. The maid came in every day on our 4 day stay and cleaned the room, changed the sheets and put more shampoo and hand lotion in the bathroom. The staff were friendly and more than helpful. We were told we could charge our ipods free, just plug them into the computers downstairs and they would charge up. Same goes for your camera's if you need to charge them up remember to take your lead, we didnt :-((. The hotel is in such a great position, great location easy walking distance for most of the main sightseeing atttractions, Central park is to the right of the hotel and Times Square to the left. Broadway just one avenue across. Really you wont go far wrong in booking this hotel. The doorman (JUDD) was that helpful with the return journey to the JFK airport we got a limo for 55$. We plan to revisit for our honeymoon in 2010. Definately coming back to this hotel. Sightseeing advice, Top of the Rocks is awesome book a sunset ticket if you can. This attraction is far better in our view than The Empire State Building. If you want to do the Empire, then our advice is to book the fast track tickets, we didnt know about them and honestly waited for three hours before getting to the top. Lifts broken and long ques to walk up 6 flights of stairs. Nightmare really. Dont pay the extra to go to the 102 floor, it really isnt worth it. Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island is a must, pay for the audio tour if you can. It really does emphasise what the immigrants had to go through to get into the US. Central Park is everything you see on the films. Take a rickshaw bike ride, the guy we had through Central Park, pointed out lots of interesting things, Where John Lennon was shot, where Yoko Ono now lives, Where Maralyn Monroe was found dead. All sounds a bit depressing, but we found it interesting. Shopping if you can fit it all in is brilliant. We had a great mix of both and got to do all the places we planned.

Anyway, the result is that we saw both the budget and more luxurious parts of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel appears to want to cater to both markets. On to the rooms. Our first room was a standard double and pretty miserable. It was very small (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 6ft 3in and kept bumping into things), hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned properly and the fixtures were old and a bit tired. Our second room (let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call it the apology room) was a king size double and was completely different \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spotlessly clean, very big and very pleasant. My in-laws\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suite was also immaculate and very comfortable. So our experience was that both the accommodation and the level of service were superior in the luxury rooms. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location was perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ten-minute walk from Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, the Rockefeller Centre. Its diner was quite pleasant and had a reassuringly American feel, and the nearby Carnegie Deli is also worth a visit (although its massive portions made for quite an expensive breakfast). I would give the Wellington Hotel a qualified recommendation. The location is amazing, and the prices very good, but our standard room on the first night (and the argument required to get it) were rather unpleasant and I would suggest getting an upgraded room if you can afford it. (The ratings I give are based on our second room - those for the standard room would be significantly lower).", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chippenham, Wiltshire, England", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant location, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "costours", "ReviewID": "UR27804647", "Content": "We were a group of six, including 2 teenagers staying for a week from 2nd April.

Yes, the hotel is a bit dated, but it's got art deco character and is set in a brilliant location, with Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave shopping and Empire State Building all within walking distance. There are lots of good delis to choose from for breakfast, lunch or dinner, we used the Park Cafe (set in the hotel) for breakfast, Fluffys down the road for a quick coffee stop and were spoiled for choice for dinner. I would recomend the Cancun Mexican restaurant near Columbus Circle for dinner. To see the sights, use the tour buses, but to get around New York quickly and safely, we would recomend getting a $7-50 metro card which gives you unlimited travel for the day.

We had a view of 7th and 56th, which was nice, but sometimes a little noisy in the mornings from all the honking of the taxis. As other reviewers have stated, our heater made a clanking noise. This happened maybe 2-3 times during the night, but we knew it would possibly do that when we booked the room. So, it didn't really bother us. For one or two nights, the room did get a little warm, but we just opened the windows and it was fine. The cool air from outside balanced out the inside. The room was one of the redecorated ones and so we were pleased with the condition of it. No bed bugs! No peeling wall paper---it was fine. Because we remembered to tip our made properly (as well as our bellman), we received good service. We opted to forego room cleaning every day, but left a small note and a nice tip for our maid. She treated us very well and the room was always thoroughly cleaned, with our specific requests filled. The Wellington Hotel is an excellent value. Some of the more negative reviews on here are unfair, in my opinion. If you are polite to the staff, they will be polite back to you. That's simply common courtesy. We saw a lot of the guests behave rudely or inconsiderately toward the hotel staff, which I felt was unnecessary. The hotel is older, which is why you're paying a less expensive rate. So, yes, some rooms will be in a shabbier condition and yes, the decor is kind of older, but it's not tacky. We found the staff to be very nice, very accommodating, and we found the rooms to be a great value. The location can't be beat! Overall, we were happy. We would stay here again, and we would definitely recommend this hotel to families without small children, traveling couples, and older people. The Greek restaurant, Molyvo's, next door to the hotel, is very good! Also, we liked Angelo's pizza by the Late Show Ed Sullivan theater. We also at at the Cafe Napoli in Little Italy. Very good food! We made good use of the all of the delis, where you can go in and choose what hot/cold foods you want. We found that to be a great money saver. One morning, we bought our breakfast and ate picnic-style in Central Park, which is just a block and a half away from the hotel. My boyfriend also rented a bike for $15/hour and rode around the park. He loved it! We also liked to be able to sit and have a nice breakfast. We ate at La Parisienne, just up 7th avenue, a few times.

The lobby center is probably a better deal if you just need to look something up, it was $1 for 2-3 minutes of internet time. The Greek restaurant next door is excellent! Our only problem with the room was the heater. We could not adjust the temperature, and the heater fan was so loud, we could not sleep! It would run quietly for 10-15 minutes, and just when we started to drift gently off to dream land, it would start to bang and clang and thump like an angry monkey was inside whacking the heater guts repeatedly with a hammer. It was absolutely the most awful sound I have ever heard coming from a machine designed for comfort, especially when you're trying to sleep! And there was no control over the temperature, it was either hot enough to roast a turkey, or we had to turn it off.

My stay was for business, and was in August, which is a notoriously hot and humid time of year for the city. I was astonished to see that this rather tall building had only two elevators, both of which were so small that only 5-6 people fit. Each morning, the wait to catch an elevator was at least 15 minutes. Not to mention that the hallways in which you have to wait are not air-conditioned. One morning, a hotel employee noticed me waiting for an uncomfortably long period of time, and sent me down in the service elevator. I opted for the stairs on other mornings.

Arrived about 8am. Entered the 7th Ave entrance - bell man helped us with our cases. Have to go up a few steps to get actually into the hotel which isn't ideal if you struggle with luggage anyway but the bell men are always there and from what we saw was always willing to help. Check in wasn't available until 3pm but after asking if its possible to have a room with a view the lady at the desk explained to come back around dinner time and our room should be ready. They kind of pre-checked us in - took all our details i.e credit card info, names etc etc so when we came back it was just a case of them handing over the key/card to our room. Came back around 1-2pm - room was just getting finished off. Hung around for 5/10 minutes looking around the foyer - lovely christmas tree, nice warm feel - quite 'old fashioned' if you like but added to the feel of the hotel in my opinion. Fire place and christmas tree were both a very nice too and again added to the feel of the hotel. Its isn't the most modern hotel you'll ever come across but its a nice homely hotel. Bell man was going to take us up to the room but we said thanks but no thanks. We'd treked right over america with our suitcases i think we could manage taking them up in a lift but as i said they were always there if you needed them. Have read reviews on here regarding the lifts - they are quite small but they aren't slow. We only experienced once 'slow moment' if you like and this was when we were heading out one morning around midday. Around this time the lifts were obviously going to get full with people and luggage working their way down to check out. We were on the 23 or 24th floor (i can't quite remember - it was either 2324 or 2423 :) ). we exited the lifts and remember thinking - 'nice decor' - there was a wall full of mirrors !! I don't know if they did this to make the corridors look bigger than they actually are but as you walk away from the lifts you realise they are really narrow. Walked into our room located right at the end of the corridor and around the corner. At first was quite disappointed with the size of our room to be honest but i think it was only because we'd been spoilt with the other 3 hotels we'd stayed in during out trip (these not being in NYC mind). We stayed in a double room and had a great view of central park (check out our pictures). I was aware before we came that rooms in NYC aren't as bit as elsewhere but what more do you need than a bed, a bathroom, work desk, and a television. There was also a cupboard wih enough room for a suitcase and housed an ironing board and iron. In reality the room was big enough - any bigger and it would have been a waste (which is why i'm glad we didn't pay for a suite). The bathroom however was small - but again it had everything you needed including a hairdryer and few amenties such as soap etc and to be honest you should spend even less time in there than you do in your room so to be honest it wasn't the end of the world. The shower however was a little tempremental - please take care !! The only thing i disliked was the air conditioning unit. It made quite a bit of noise - i woke one evening and had to feel around the floor because i was adament it was leaking but it was just the water in the pipes. It was loud to begin with but we soon got used to it. Housekeeping did a great job - considering its a, lets say, 'older' hotel (not old but not new in comparison to others), its very clean and the rooms are quite modern and alot nicer than and make up for the first impressions you get with the corridors. I would certainly stay here again - researched alot for this trip and this came out the cheapest. Booked direct with the hotel to enable me to cancel/amend if necassary. 5/10 minutes from central park to the right as you exit the hotel and 5/10 minutes to the times square area to the left. You have a subway underneath the hotel itself which is what i would say is one of the main lines and can take you just about anywhere between central park and brooklyn bridge (although transfers maybe necassary). The Park Cafe also underneath the hotel is ideal and unless i'm mistaken provides the room service. We got a little something one evening and it was very nice and reasonably priced too. They also have a gift shop which is on the street outside but is also connected to the hotel - it isn't open all the time but is the majority of the day. That said should you want anything theres a couple of deli's round and about the hotel too including the carnegie deli just across the road. You won't be disappointed if you stay here - it is a bargain of a hotel in a fantastic location.

I was pleasently surprised at the location of the hotel, as we were more central then I expected, only a few blocks to the right was Central Park and to the left was Times Square both taking about 5 minutes to get to. The hotel is very nice, it could do with an update, but we were out by 8am every morning, and didn't return until 9pm most nights, and by that time we were ready for bed, so it served a very good purpose and it was lovely and warm. The room was small, and basic, but was enough for two people, and we had a TV, with lots of different channels, and an option to buy Movie channels for $12 that were not even out in England. The only gripe about the hotel was the light switch as it was opposite the shower, and if the water was on full power it would come very close to switch which was worrying, and there was only one plug point opposite the shower. We were on the 14th floor, and we could not hear any noise from outside, the view was not great, (a grey building opposite) but there could be worse things to worry about and we were hardly there, and one side of the building does look out over Central Park. The lift from the lobby to our hotel was very slow and you sometimes had to wait for the second lift due to the amount of people waiting. The staff are very friendly, and helpful especially Frank in Conceirge OUTSIDE HOTEL The tube station was literally outside the door, however we never had the need to use it as we walked everywhere. There is a lovely greek restaurant below the hotel, which you can access through the hotel which was great on the days we didn't want to go far for dinner and face the cold, as it was very, very cold. I thought London was bad! FOOD We found the food in general quite expensive, and a tip is expected at 20%, and they are quite forthcoming in asking. In fact after eating at the burger bar opposite the hotel, on our first night and leaving $3, we were shouted at by the waitress, saying we must leave $8 despite her not being very helpful at all. Similar situations happened throughout the holiday, so be aware that if you don't leave a tip, they will probably challenge it. NEW YEARS EVE We arrived on new years eve, as it's meant to be the best place to celebrate, but we were quite disappointed. We decided to go out at 9pm, which we assumed was still 'early' but by this time there were so many people, and the pavements were shut off, we couldn't walk any further then outside the hotel and congregate in the road. I never expected to be at the front, but I assumed they would put the big screens/speakers up so you can see and hear what was happening, in the sides road leading up to times sq, however there was nothing, and although we were close, due to the amount of people, we could not see or hear anything at all. After one hour of standing in the cold and not moving any further forward we decided to go to the bar in the hotel, and came back out at 11.45pm, which was a nice atmosphere as everyone was counting down and fireworks were let off in central park. It wasn't until we got back to the hotel we saw the celebritites and events throughout the night that took place in Times Square which looked fantastic but unfortunately we didn't see anything. Apparently people start congregating at 4pm, if not earlier, but to be honest even if we arrived earlier it was so cold, and impossible to stand for that long. Be aware if you do want to aim for the front and get there early, if you move for the toilet/food you will lose your place and no alcohol is allowed. SHOPPING I would strongly recommend a trip to Woodbury Common, it's about an hour from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and costs $40 but the money you save there in comparison to shops on 5th Avenue, you will not regret it, not only are the prices cheaper, it was then offering a further discount and if you go to the visitors centre, you will receive a big booklet of further discounts which can you used with other offers so can work out very cheap. 5th Avenue wasn't very cheap, but was a great experience, and walking from Central Park to 34th Street, we managed to fit in lots of sight seeing too. I would recommend flat and comfortable shoes and if you go in the winter, a hat, scarf and gloves. SIGHTSEEING On our last night we visited the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has a revolving restaurant/bar on the 47th floor. It was AMAZING! you can see everything, and the rooms are lovely decorated, it was very romantic, but there was groups of people too so caters for everyon. it was a lovely atmosphere. Be aware that even if you stay for a drink, you will be charged for the view which was about $12, and we were not made aware of this before, but for us it was worth it and a great experience.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood value location for your money\u201d", "Author": "LondonPigeon2", "ReviewID": "UR23451585", "Content": "Stayed at theWellington hotel for 6 nights over the new newyear great location.

Hot tosted bagels every morning and really realy good looking muffins all at such reasonable prices! I would recomend goin to see the Emire state obviously but i wouldnt recomend going up it! Rockerfeller is Cheaper, bigger, no ques and as a bonus you get the empire state in all your pictures of the views! For your evening meal.. and entertainment I can highly recomend 'Ellens Stardust Diner' its in times square (just off) all the wait staff are at profoming arts school and work on broadway trying to make it big, But oh man can they sing!!

The Hotel was very centrally located, we were checked in quickly and had our bags taken to our room straight away. Although we didn't have much of a view, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable and all we needed when we were up and out for 8.30 and out for most of the day and night. The room was cleaned daily with clean sheets and towels. It was only a 5 minute walk into Times Square and 5 minutes into Central Park, with the Subway across the road and numerous Delis to choose from. We found the Deli immediately across the road quite expensive, but Fluffy's and the Stage Deli was enjoyable and reasonable. In the Cafe attached to the hotel we paid $12 for two small beers. Tips did seem to eat into our holiday budget quite a lot over there. We found we were within walking distance of the Empire State Building and Macy's, although a bit of a trek, and also the Rockerfeller Centre. We paid $49 each for the All Around City hop on hop off bus trips with Grayline Red bus tours, where we had an uptown tour, downtown tour and Holiday lights night tour, and could have had the Brooklyn tour but you had to pick up the bus from the South side. You could get off any time you liked, visit the place you wanted and jump back on the next available bus which came every 15 mins. We found the hotel a fantastic base, staff were extremely helpful, and on the day we left, as soon as we came down with our suitcases, a porter asked if we needed a taxi to the airport and that they would keep our suitcases for the rest of the day until we needed to leave. For $55 all in he ordered a luxury Sedan to take us to the airport, when a yellow cab cost $45 plus $5 toll plus tip from the airport. Everything was so well organised.

The room was a little worn around the edges, but was generally clean and warm. There were 4 female members of my family in the room and we had two double beds. It was nicely set up for us, with the beds in two separate areas, and two separate bathrooms. The attached cafe was nice enough for breakfast but was so busy they were sometimes queuing out of the door - and you therefore felt a bit rushed.

I arrived as a single traveler and they gave me a two bedroom/two bathroom suite on the 24th floor with views of Central Park to the north. The hotel is very conveniently located to all major attractions. It does have some wear and tear on it (door casings scuffed, a few carpet stains, etc.), but my room was clean. The bed mattress was quite soft. The drawbacks to the hotel room was that there was not any small fridge or coffee maker, which is generally standard in many hotel rooms. I would like to have saved some left overs from expensive meals out, but there was no way to keep them fresh. I would suggest taking/buying a collapsible vinyl cooler and getting ice (provided by room service only) to chill drinks/left overs. A nearby deli, BENASH, which is immediately south of the hotel on 7th and 55th, is a place I would NOT RECOMMEND. My lunch was $27 (chicken salad sandwich, fries and $5.95 drink) plus $5 tip totaled to a $32 lunch for one. The sandwich was so ridiculously overs-sized that I ended up wasting half of it because of no fridge in the hotel room. Secondly, this same deli charged me $6.40 for a canoli, which was tasteless and the crust was limp/damp. The bakery right next door to the south sells canolis for $3.50.

Taxi from outside the airport was a flat rate $45 inc tolls not tips again very straight forward. HOTEL: Upon arrival at the Wellington hotel we were very happy, we checked in very busy but quick, given room 426 (4th floor) very clean tidy and had everything you needed in order to lay your head after all your not in NYC to stay in your room all day! Bathroom facilities were just what we needed bath toilet sink and a very powerful shower considering it was an old shower, the only MINOR prob was me and my friend had a double bed?? we booked throu hayes and jarvis who said a standard room was twin beds, this is not the case, but as i said before we only needed to sleep in the bed and it was big enough and comfy enough for the both of us. The lifts are a little slow and rather small so for those on higher floors this may be an issue for us we didnt mind. LOCATION: What a fantastic location!! 7th Ave at 55th Street. Central Park was at the end of 7th Ave literally a 3min walk, Times Sq was about a 5-10min walk at most, go on to 5th Ave and you were the perfect end for all the shops! Rockafella Centre was only a few blocks down and the Empire State was a bit of a walk at 34th Street but we did walk it, there and back!! 5mins from 53rd Street Subway and take the E train to the last stop for Ground Zero and then you can walk from Ground Zero to the ferry port for Liberty and Ellis Island! PRICES: An idea for anyone travelling out to NYC in the near future, Liberty and Ellis Island $12 Rockafella Top of the Rock $20 Subway Round Trip to Ground Zero $4pp Empire State Building $25 Taxi From JFK $45 plus tip Private Car to Newark arrange by hotel $75 plus tip Central Park Ice Skating $23 inc skate hire, locker and skate for as long as you like $6 return for lockers Central Park Zoo $10 TIPS: Rockafella Top Of The Rock we did this at 11pm and it was pratically empty which was fab we had the New York Skyline to ourselves. Bloomingdales offers an 11% off visitors card, get this from the visitors station and you can get 11% off everyting but food and perfumes.

The bed slept wonderfully - very comfortable - and the bathroom was newly remodeled, with marble looking tile floors, extremely clean, and with an absolutely fabulous showerhead with lots of water pressure (sometimes hard to find in older hotels!).

Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue etc. It is a clean hotel with all the facilities you need. Polite and helpful staff. And a real buzz in reception. We found a great little bar just a block away, we also found a lovely little diner, where we had our breakfast most mornings. Good access to the Subway also close by, so that was not a problem. All round i really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only bad thing i could say was the attitude of one of the bar staff in the adjoining Bar. One of our party, who's 21st Birthday it was, asked for a Manhattan cocktail and his attitude was terrible, he scowled and said \"why are you ordering that, just because you are in Manhattan\".

The reviewers are correct - the lobby can be quite small - the hotel seems to like taking on large groups and when they are arriving/departing the lobby becomes quite congested, but hey, you're in NYC. The room we had booked was a Queen - and we were pleasantly suprised with the nice size of the room and it even had a kitchenette which was a plus, however too bad they don't provide coffee for the coffee machine in the room. So here starts my \"small\" rant. It's the details that make the difference in a guest's stay - I was disappointed by there not being coffee provided for a room that had a coffee maker in it. When I inquired at the \"Convenience Store/Gift Shop\" off the lobby if they carried coffee for the guest rooms, the clerk (maybe owner) there told me the hotel had horrible amenities and no they didn't sell coffee for the rooms. This disappointment compounded when we went down to the \"cashier\" booth the next day to get change for our American $50's only to be told that they didn't have any change, to which I said, \"but you're the cashier??\" and then told to go line up at the Guest Services counter (keep in mind how busy everything is) - only to be told once again that there was no change and to come back later - this was 9:15 am in the morning - surely the manager was around by that time to be able to get them change. We went down the street to a bank instead - which is an inconvenience. We ordered room service one morning and it was perfect. Good presentation, quality and temperature. The hotel was perfect for us Broadway show hopping and just a quick walk to Times Square so overall very conveniently located. Would I do it over again... maybe - overall there wasn't really anything major wrong - just nothing to make me go wow I really want to stay here again next time we visit NYC - we usually go every two years - maybe next time it will be at another hotel deserving of our travel $'s.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northumberland", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant experience\u201d", "Author": "Coachman01", "ReviewID": "UR21741563", "Content": "After reading previous reviews my daughter and I were a little wary.

So for the rate of $369 at the Wellington, I wasnt too disappointed. Like other reviewer's say, you are only in your room to sleep. I had read to ask for the newly renovated rooms, and what a difference that makes!! Tile & carpets are new, flat screen tvs...etc. Very spacious rooms also for this area. Great water pressure in bathrooms and the wall unit AC actually worked perfect! I loved the Park Cafe in the lobby. They make the best food in the quickest time ever!! You will not be disappointed. They are also in charge of room service at the hotel, and the same goes there. We ordered full breakfast at 9:00 from Room service and it was delivered hot and delicious at 9:15...I was truly amazed. You rarely get this kind of service in any Hotel! We went into the restaurant Molyvos, but only for a drink at the bar. Nice atmosphere though, I just personally don't care for the Mediterranean cuisine served there. The location of this hotel makes it a big plus IMHO. Close enough to walk to Times Square, Carnegie, Central Park, 5th Ave. Shopping, etc... Also very easy to catch a cab here when you need one. The bellman is wonderful !! We took full advantage of the subway station outside of the hotel. The four of us traveled to World Trade Center site, Statue of Liberty, Herald Square, Times Square and Yankee Stadium over the 3 days. For $2.00 per fare, we saved a great deal of time and money here. And there is always a friendly toll booth person down there to help you if you get lost..which we did once. :) There is a small deli across the street that is open 24 hours per day, which I think is very important to know due to the fact that at midnight the hotel is basically closed. No vending machines, no room service, no restaurants or bars....so when I wanted a soda at 2:00am the hotel told my hubby to walk across the street to pick us up one. All in all, this was a fun trip for us. We came to see the Yankees and spend some time seeing sites we had never seen during our previous winter trip. The Wellington is a charming, old hotel with character and was perfect for our needs.

So here goes; Location - If you must be in the heart of Midtown Manhattan at all costs, you won't be disappointed. Its about five minutes on foot to Central Park and pretty much perfectly placed for everything you'll ever need to do. There's a subway station under the intersection that the hotel sits on (the station is 57th Street on the NQRW lines - when in the station, exit at the 55th & 7th end of the platform and aim for the NE corner). If you're exhausted after a day sightseeing the 55 Street Deli across the road has a good selection of salads, hot pasta, chinese dishes etc. which you can take out and eat in your room - we did this on a couple of occasions. Food - Didn't try Movylos (at least, that's what I think it's called - the Greek restaurant in the hotel). The Park Diner is fine but gets busy at breakfast and you may have to queue - We breakfasted at the Benash Deli across the road which is bigger, much less crowded and just as good. Reception, check in, staff etc - All absolutely fine, we found the staff cheerful, friendly and willing to help, give advice, hail yellow cabs etc. Decor - Tired, bordering on shabby, and undoubtably could do with a makeover. Marks on carpets and wallpaper - couldn't tell which bits had been refurbished by looking at the hallways etc (but 2nd floor looks grim - never saw anyone get in the lifts here except staff though) Room - stayed in 1201, which is a suite; decor as above, but the suite was large and the bedroom contained a double and single bed. (Queen size sofabed in lounge). Lots of storage space, with an iron and ironing board provided. Beds were comfortable and linen and towels changed daily. Room was kept spotlessly clean by housekeeping, and the kitchenette looked virtually new, with a new fridge and microwave, BUT!! No tea & coffee making facilities, and no cutlery, plates or anything except four glasses. Why?? Air conditioning units hanging out of the windows in the sitting room and bedroom (by no means unusual in older buildings in NYC) and quite noisy but this helps to blot out the noise from the streets, so no problem. Bathroom smallish and also in need of a makeover, but the shower worked fine and the hairdryer was new. The room was also a bit dark, mainly due to the tired blinds, which wouldn't go all the way up. We only used the place as a base, so the minor downs didn't bother us too much. Overall - Not a business hotel, but then it isn't as expensive as one. This is a budget tourist hotel which, although a bit on the tired side, is actually perfectly OK if you just plan to use it as a base for exploring New York City and do nothing but sleep there. If you want the familiarity and reassuring quality of a chain, pay the extra and stay at either of the two Sheratons or the Hilton, which are all within a couple of blocks of the Wellington.

Check in was quick and easy - just us and 3 staff.

She was lovely and looked at lots of rooms on the computer for us, reading out descriptions of views and facilities. We'd paid $1000 for 4 nights for the 4 of us. We got a suite - room 923 over looking 7th Ave. We had a small kitchenette with a large fridge freezer, hob and microwave, kettle and cupboards- only used fridge and kettle but these were very useful. Our room had a king size bed - the comfiest bed we have ever slept in - the mattress label was Jan 08. We also had a built in wardrobe next to the bathroom, a sofa, coffee table, dining table and 3 chairs, tv in unit with 2 deep drawers, dressing table and mirror. Our kids room had a double and single bed - no arguments at night and kicking contests!! They also very large dressing table / drawer unit and wardrobe and own TV - they couldn't belive their luck. The bathroom was fine with a very powerful shower over the bath. The decor was not great - very beige and the furniture poor quality but the space was amazing for NY, I would rather have space than posh bedspreads. If they did this place up they could charge a lot more. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was also clean and house keeping efficient, sending up 4 more pillows when we rang them. We didn't hear any pipes or have a.c. problems as some people have mentioned. One worrying thing was the fact that the windows opened fully and you could lean right out, or jump if you wanted to! Check out was 12pm but our daughter was ill on our last day so we asked if we could have a bit longer and the manager let us have the room until 2pm for no charge. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on food but we got stamps and a few bits from the little shop and the stamps were cheaper for the UK than the machines.

Next morning the Assistant Front Office Manager explained that they were upgrading the pipes by lagging them, but they hadn't reached that floor. Yet, they had put us in that room for 7 nights. Whilst complaining, I mentioned that I intended to review this hotel on Trip Advisor (because I had read the reviews here before I booked and I wasn't put off) and I'm sure that's why we were moved to a King room in the new part of the hotel. It was a corner room, twice the size of the first and luxurious. The side window looked down to the lights of Times Square and as we were on the 26th floor we never closed the blind, we had this fantasic light show 24/7. If you are on a budget you may have to put up with grubby and small. I couldn't have afforded the better room. Be prepared to complain, perhaps we Brits are not expected to.

It was dirty and was right next to the elevator (which has a very loud and annoying bell on it). After asking to be moved, we were put in a MUCH better room - it's definitely worth asking, and the staff were glad to help. Even though it was a drastic improvement on the first room, it was still pretty basic for the price, and there's no view except the derelict building next door. Decor was weird - it was like stepping back into the 1940s. Everything is covered in brass! The elevators were also original features. In addition to the loud bell (a constant DING at all hours of the day and night), they were very slow indeed, and the stairs are so steep as to not be a practical alternative.

The hotel convenience store offers bottled water and souvenirs at a reasonable price. The main reason for staying at the Wellington is the location. five minutes walk up or down the avenue will take you to Time Square or Central Park respectively, and there's a tube link to 34th street right on the corner outside the door.

The bed was definitely not a Sleep Number but it was as comfortable as a hotel bed can be. Can't comment on the noise because I were earplugs to bed. The hotel is 3 blocks from the Columbus Circle subway, Whole Foods and the Park which is very convenient. One negative experience was at the hotel Cafe which sucked. The food was bland and overpriced and I could have had a better, cheaper dinner at the Whole Foods cafeteria. Even the dessert tasted strange. Having stayed in a NYC hotels ranging from boutique to 5 star, I would recommend this hotel for those on a budget and travelers who are interested in seeing the city and not the hotel room.

The lobby is unassuming, but the rooms are quite dated. Furnishings are worn and ugly, beds are uncomfortable, carpet is dirty. The first room we were given was a \"complimentary upgrade\" to a tower double, which the front desk also told me was one of their \"recently renovated\" rooms -- you wouldn't know it if they didn't tell you so. The room was small (which we expected) and very hot (we tried running the AC all night, but it never cooled off). The furnishings all showed significant wear, and the carpet was stained in several places. The bathroom was nondescript, and the temperature of the water in the shower fluctuated from comfortable to scalding at random intervals. Worst of all, the double bed was painfully uncomfortable, sagging significantly in the middle, and was so short that my feet hung off (I'm only 5'11\"). We spent one night in the \"tower double\" room before moving to an \"interior queen,\" which was not really any better. The bed was, obviously, slightly larger, but not really much more comfortable -- at least it didn't sag, though. Most of the same problems as mentioned above, but we were able to regulate the temperature slightly better and had fewer problems with the temperature of the water in the shower. The room was the first on the hallway, and as such was next to a door which slammed loudly every time someone came through it. We could also hear any noise/speech in the hallway with perfect clarity -- soundproofing is completely non-existent. There were pipes outside of our window that would rattle intermittently. The staff at the hotel are commendable for at least making an effort. I get the feeling that they are all too familiar with the condition of the hotel and the problems that come with it. For the most part, they are good people who are trying to make the best with what they have to work with. Just be kind in asking for them to provide you better accommodations and you may have far better luck. After all, it's not their fault that the hotel sucks -- they're just doing their jobs.

We used the room for showering and a \"nap\" at night. One tip I read on another review. The hotel does have a more recently renovated section.

But what stood out the most would be the air conditioning unit that was duct taped to the window.. allowing cold air and noise to filter in. I made mention of the air conditioning unit and cold air situation to the front desk, only to be asked my name which would be added to the \"upgrade list/book\" that would not be viewed until the next morning. We thought all the rooms at the Wellington had air conditioning units hanging out the window, until the next morning, while walking back from having breakfast at the Carnegie Deli (good food, good service, good prices- only cash) we looked up to our room (9th floor) and noticed our room was the only room that had an airconditioning unit hanging out the window. We took a picture. The Wellington controls the heat in the rooms. We ended up not upgrading. Why bother? We did end up using the window ledge inside our room as a refridgerator. By pulling down the shade to cover the air conditioning unit. Enough \"cold\" air blew in to keep our beverages and food cool. We took a picture of that as well. If I had it to book over again, I would suggest to anyone going to New York City for the first time, to book a room with a kitchenette. You will save money in the long run. As food is very expensive. A word of caution to you steak eaters. Do not eat at \"Benash\" restaurant across the street from the Wellington on 7th and 55th. The steak my husband ordered at \"Benash\" smelled like rotten meat. The service is bad, the prices are horrible, the waiters like to bully the tourists by telling them they have to pay 20% tip (One of the tricks the low end restaurant wait-staff like to pull on tourists). The \"Park Cafe\" which is located inside the Wellington has excellent room service breakfast. But, sadly, while seated at the \"Park Cafe\" for dinner, our waitress tried the \"tourist-tip\" bully trick. Most disappointing. The restaurant \"Molyvos\" also located inside the Wellington, has fabulous Greek food (the octopus is wonderful), the drinks are stout. The ambiance perfect.

I took the wellington with a grain of salt as it was one night. If I was traveling with a family I honestly would have been irate, its a nice hotel from the front but the rooms/lobby are simply not ok. The lobby was 3 star at best the room 1 star. I have family who is from europe and they said it was bad but 'ok' compared to a hostel in europe. I figure thats what makes this hotels rating a three, the European vote drags it up. The hotel is not an American 3 star, its a 1920`s no remodel star at best. These are the five main problems. 1) first was booked into a room in which you must travel down some back stairs to get to an elevator. The elevator area is simply gross, peeling wall paper, stained and loose carpeting. The room was seriously tiny to the point I was scared. I have traveled throughout Asia and NOTHING was this small, no more than 150 square feet if that. 2) I was switched to a new room a 'suite' this suite sure wasn't sweet thats for sure. The floors in this hotel are tiny, my sister who visited referred to it as jail size and I thought that was nice. When you exit the elevator the wall is no more than 2.5 feet in front of you. The carpeting, doors and walls in the hall of the 16th floor are simply not acceptable. The room I was sent to was creepy, looks like it hasn't been upgraded for at least 40 years. I seriously regretted having watched the move \"room 1408\" cause I was a bit scared. There were missing lights loose wiring and drapes that made a 70`s porno look classy. 3) The bedding is gross, I honestly slept with a shirt on to avoid bugs. I am not a picky guy but this place was really bad, I actually brought family over so we could laugh at the room. 4) The elevator is slow as hell and honestly the oldest and most terrible one I have been in for awhile. I was a bit hesitant and considered taking the stairs 16 stories to avoid the 10 minute wait and 3 minute ride in that bucket o crap. 5) for the price the hotel i switched to The Park Central was a blessing and 50 bucks a night less The park central was wonderful, clean remodeled room, clean bathroom, new carpet etc. The staff was great lobby new, fast elevators etc. I couldn't take pictures cause I was to busy laughing at my ill fate and trying to avoid loose wiring, I apologize.", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Surprise Despite Mixed Reviews\u201d", "Author": "Wonposet", "ReviewID": "UR11731500", "Content": "We usually stay at four star hotels but booked three nights at the Wellington on Orbitz the last minute.

The cab brought us to the 55th Street entrance of the hotel, and it was awkward carrying the bags ujp a few steps into the lobby. I didn't kinow the main entrance was on 7th Avenue. The lobby was gorgeous and warmed with a fireplace. There were long lines of people waiting to check in and check out, but the staff were friendly and efficient, and our wait was minimal. I explained to the clerk that I had worked all night and needed to get a bit of sleep before we went to our scheduled shows. Immediately he got us into a room on the eight floor of the North Building. The elevators were small and outdated but were much faster than the highly computerized system at the Marriott Marquise, where we had often waited 20 minutes to get to our floor. The hallways were a little dated as was our room, but it was large, comfortable, and immaculately clean. We had requested a queen sized bed. We got a room with two full sized beds. The beds were comfortable. The room was a bit warm but cooled down quickly when we opened a window for a few minutes. Our room faced the courtyard and was quiet. The bathroom was immaculately clean. It was stocked with fresh towels, which the maid replaced every day. We took a few showers and used up all the shampoo and cosmetics very quickly, and the maid replenished them on a second trip to the room. We were so impressed that we left her a larger than usual tip. The Internet was wireless and was a little difficult to connect. I didn't know I needed to get an access number from the front desk. Otherwise I would have had no trouble. The room had a few minor problems. The shades closed only to within 6 inches of the bottom of the windows, and the drapes did not cover all the windows. There was a flickering compact fluorescent light in one of the lamps. Nonetheless, these problems were minor compared to our general experience. The room had a refrigerator that allowed us to get soda from Duane Reed and cheesecake from the delightful bakery next door and keep them for a late night snack. The location was great. We were within a block of Carnegie Hall, the Carnegie Deli, the Stage Deli, and Ben Ash Delicatessan, all of which serve portions too large for a tourist. Previously I had avoided them. This time we had a delightful meal at the Ben Ash Deli and brought the leftovers to the hotel room for a second meal.

The entire staff was pleasant, helpful, and friendly. In the past I stayed at higher rated hotels and usually had good experiences.

My fiance and I both felt when we came home that our showers were lacking a little something! Plenty of hot water too which was nice after getting rained on at the Browns/Jets game! About the reviews saying it needs updating... again, it's an old hotel with a ton of rooms... We weren't going to NYC to stay in our hotel, so as long as our bed was clean and the bathroom was clean, I didn't care! Our maids were awesome! My only complaint was the radiators which are very loud. I live in the country so I'm not used to loud noises so my sleep was pretty interrupted whenever the heat would kick on. My fiance however lives in Toronto so he slept like a baby! We had absolutely zero street noise which is pretty shocking! The location of this hotel makes it worth staying at again. You couldn't beat where it was for the price! If you are expecting the Plaza or the Waldorf, don't stay here, but if you are looking for a reasonable clean hotel within walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Port Authority, Empire State Building, etc., the Wellington is perfect!", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pencoed, Wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price\u201d", "Author": "Pontygirl", "ReviewID": "UR11540883", "Content": "I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Wellington, along with my partner and two other couples.

But, in the grand scheme of things, what's a 5-minute wait? If you're that bothered by it, use the stairs. The staff were friendly and very helpful, particularly Dan on reception. I was also impressed by the lady who serviced our room each day. The location is excellent. It's only a few minutes walk to Times Square or, in the opposite direction, Central Park. There are delis and restaurants right on the doorstep, not to mention shops and theatres. There are obviously other hotels in the same area, but none charging as reasonable a price as the Wellington. The shopping in New York is, as expected, superb (especially with the rate of British pounds to the US dollar right now). And you don't have to walk far to get to it!!

My advice is that when you arrive, check out the room, if it's not suitable then ask for a change. As there are plenty of wonderful rooms on offer.

Our booking through the travel agent meant that we could only have a standard double but when we checked in, we asked if we could change to a twin room. We were able to swap after a couple of days with no hassle. Our first room was quite bijou and I suppose the decor in the hotel rooms may be a bit dated, but our experience was that the rooms were clean and the beds comfy which was mostly what we were concerned about. We didn't see any giant cockroaches or mice I'm glad to say! Our visit was in October/November but the weather was quite mild and we found the heating in the room to be too much (we're used to the cold in Northern Ireland!)

Reception staff were helpful and efficient and although there were sometimes queues at reception, we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes. The reception area is very pleasant and cosy and is usually quite busy but that adds to the ambience. Previous reviews have commented on the slow lifts. Again, in a busy hotel, sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for the lift but they are quite fast . We didn't have to wait for the lifts for more than a couple of minutes but perhaps during peak holiday times you may have to wait longer. The location of the Wellington is fantastic and there are subway stations nearby if your energy is flagging. We had breakfast most mornings in the Park Cafe, adjoined to the hotel. We did have to queue a few times but the queue moved quickly. Service and food is excellent and reasonably priced and definitely sets you up for a day of sightseeing/walking everywhere. We went to the BenAsh diner across the street one morning. The food was okay but it was quite expensive compared to the Park Cafe. We can also recommend Fluffy's Cafe and Bakery (a few doors down on 7th avenue) for excellent muffins and the best cappuccino ever.

This holiday was a disaster from start to finish. The only positives were NYC and British Airways (surprising I know)! We arrived at the Hotel having been collected by a Thomas Cook representative (who later claimed she didn't work for TC but was quite happy to collect her commission from selling various tours) - there was no register or check conducted to make sure everyone was collected, and we later heard of couples who had been left at the airport or left at the hotel. On check in we learned that no room had been reserved for us and after lenghty conversations with both the TC rep and the Hotel Manager a room was found for us for two nights, but with no guarantee of anything further. We were told our rep would resolve this by the time we arrived for the NY City Tour the following morning. Initally, we were offered the option of sharing a suite with another couple we had never met before, who were in precisely the same predicament as we were. The room we were given for our first night was quite frankly a disgrace and looked nothing like the pictures on the website, or brochure that we saw - we can only assume these images were of the penthouse suite. The room was dirty, worn, badly in need of redecoration, the bed sheets had not been ironed and looked creased and possibly slept in (!?) the bathroom was cramped and again looked unclean and to top it off the pipes banged throughout the night making sleep virtually impossible. The following morning we got up and resolved to make the best of our situation, after all, the room would have been sorted and we had our tour to look forward to. On meeting our rep in the lobby she presented us with the TC booking reference and assured us that by simply showing this at reception a room would be found for us. Alas, this was not the case the Welington's manager said it was not their booking reference and their was no reference of us on their system. As such he could only guarantee us accommodation for another night and then by taking a copy of our credit card. We then spoke to the TC rep, afterall she would be able to speak to the manager and either arrange a return flight home or alternate accommodation. At least that is what we though a TC rep would do...but of course she doesn't work for TC and as such \"emphathised with our situation but had done all she could....\" With no help from the rep and no help from the Hotel Manager, we asked to make a phone call to TC in the UK. Obviously the hotel would allow us to dial TC or our rep would provide us with the faclities to do so...but NO! We had to pay to call the UK, no phone was provided for us, instead we had to use a combination of our mobile phone and phone cards. With the situation unresolved we were then unable to go on our booked tour (as to do so would mean all UK offices would have been closed and we would have been trusting in the compentency of the Hotel staff to resolve everything by our return). After speaking to the UK and wasting an entire morning, buying phone cards, using public phones, and being passed from pillar to post, the Hotel Manager then phoned us to say he had been able to arrange for a King Size Room - an upgrade...this was after having been told that no rooms were available. I would just like to stress at this point that not once were we offered an apology and we found both the TC rep and hotel staff to be rude and unfriendly. We then had to move our bags from our old room to the new one. The Kingsize room was OK, but not what you would expect from a supposed superior option. It was essentially the same as our previous room but larger, with a slightly less frequent melody coming from the pipes. Our holiday then improved as we spent the vast majority of our time out and about and as far away from the Hotel as possible. Our transfer back to the JFK airport from the hotel went fairly smoothly, until check in at the airport where no record was found of any of our parties bookings. Therefore not everyone was able to be booked onto the flight and had to be diverted to Heathrow. Hardly, the perfect end to your holiday and not what you want after about 12 hours of travelling. We will be seeking appropriate compensation from TC for the shambles we experienced and will update this review with the outcome.

They said there was no way my room could be made ready early. Hm, very accomodating. I recently returned from my honeymoon is Aruba, where the resort fell all over themselves making sure our room was ready early. Annoying. Anyway, they took my luggage somewhere to lock it up while I grabbed some lunch at Park Cafe, the hotel's restaurant. That was fine - a moderate selection of meals at reasonable prices. When I came back and went up to my room, I was mildly horrified. I could get past the fact that I have seen sardine cans that were larger (I have stayed in many hotels in NYC that had small rooms, but made up for it with basic creature comforts), but it was hard to overlook a few other things: immediately outside my window was the neon Wellington sign which lit up the whole room unless I closed the (nonfunctional) rolling shade circa 1942. The carpet was very dingy, as others have mentioned, and there was a surprising lack of ammenities. No coffee maker, cheap toiletries, and no literature about the city (which I generally rely on when seeking out routes or restaurants). Good thing I was traveling alone, because the bathroom was so small I couldn't shut the door for fear I would have an onset of claustrophobia.

I thoroughly inspected the bedding before sleeping at night for evidence of other people's hair/stains/mice droppings. Luckily, I found none of these things.

Most of the reviews read favourably, indicating that the main advantage of staying here was its location on 7th Ave/55th St. Upon entering the Hotel we were greeted with a HUGE grand looking chandelier, lighting up the reception area. The staff were pleasant and helpful when checking us in, upgrading us to a Queen Room instead of the Double we'd previously booked, without us even having to ask! Our room was located on the 9th floor (923 if you're interested!) But upon entering the lifts to head up to our room we got an inkling as to what was in store. It's a very tired, old hotel in desperate need of a makeover. The elevators are very slow (you can be waiting an age at busy times). The room we were allocated was clean and tidy, but felt dark and pretty uninviting. Old carpets that were frayed at the edges and old furniture that was a little cheap and rickety decorated the small space. There're no tea/coffee facilities in the room, which I missed after a long day out walking the streets of Manhattan. No safety deposit box in the rooms either, and not a great deal of space/storage generally. It was fine for a base in the city as you don't plan on spending a lot of time in your room, and we really couldn't fault the location (About 4 blocks down from Central Park and about 9 blocks up from Times Square) The beds were remade and fresh towels were delivered daily, so it was hardly squalor, but it just felt a tad old fashioned/outdated.

I was with my brother and preferred not to share a single small bed. The hotel informed me that changing to a larger bed or room with two beds would require an addition $30-60 plus taxes.

From the entrace you can see Central Park one way and Time Square the other. Not exactly the most upmarket spot in town, but handy for sight seeing as most of the bus tours leave from across the street at the vistsors centre or Time Square. The hotel itself is a tiny bit tired looking, with a small lobby area. Disapointed upon arrival to be told that myself and my mother had been allocated a double room not the twin we had booked and no real effort was made to find us a twin room as with the company we had booked via room preference is only a request, not a guarentee. So we shared a double bed, which wasn't the end of the world but the twin we thought we'd booked would have been nice, especially as we were on the trip to celebrate my mum's 60th birthday which they were aware of well in advance. In my experience most other hotels would have made a bit of effort to allocate you a decent room under such circumstances, but not here. The room itself was very, very small, a bit dated but clean. Bathroon again clean but a tiny shoe box of a room. Not a great view of a brick wall in an alley either, with absolutly no daylight and looking directly into other peopls rooms. Again, not a particulary good room for such a special occasion, a view of the street alone would have been an improvement and it would have been nice to be able to open the curtains at least! The diner served nice food with friendly staff and the gift shop had a nice selection of resonably priced items. Didn't eat in the Greek resteraunt attached but it looked very nice. Overall, although I didn't hate the hotel, for the same price I could have stayed in the Novotel in nearly the same location, with a gaurenteed twin room and a view of something better than a brick wall and other peoples rooms and a much better standard of accomodation. It wasn't the holiday from hell I was dreading after reading some of these reviews but I wouldn't stay here again. If coming to NYC for a special occasion, pay that little bit more to stay somewhere a bit more memorable.

Then our 3 night stay was just a series of general annoyances - the staff were rude in every respect, room decor was shabby, bathroom wasn't particularly clean, everything seemed a bit musty. Our room was scorching hot, then freezing cold, then scorching hot. We asked 3 times for the heating to be sorted out and eventually we were moved to a higher floor and marginally better room (we wanted a higher floor in the first place) where the heating worked. On two occasions we had the inconvenience of being woken up in the middle of the night by new hotel guests, who had evidently been given the wrong room number (no doubt by the inept receptionist), trying to gain access to our room. To top it all off, at the end of our stay the porter wrestled my case off me and dragged it out to the pavement, then stood waiting for a tip! Then the taxi driver started going the wrong way because he'd been told to take us to La Guardia instead of JFK, maybe the hotel staff were getting their own back on I and my friend - the non-tipping English guests!!

We (wife and two kids, ages 1 and 4) stayed Sunday Jul 8th, 2007. Here's the true scoop: CHECK-IN: Was able to check in early (1:00pm); no wait at all. Front lobby was adequately clean and pleasant. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Bell boy had our bags up to room before we even unlocked door. Also provided us with a clean crib (pack-n-play) for the 1yr old. ROOM: Had a 1-BR suite (US$214 before taxes/fees, using auto club rate via hotel's online site). Roomier than other more expensive Manhattan hotel studio rooms I've stayed at (Marriott Marquis, Sheraton Towers, etc). Air conditioning was FANTASTIC on unbearably hot day outside. Room was very clean. Furniture is slightly dated, and hotel is obviously one of the older ones, but nothing worth much worry. Pull-out sofa in living area was about what you expect from a pull-out: 4yr old thought it was great; an adult might find it marginal comfort-wise. Kitchen nook has a microwave, small apt-size fridge, so it met our needs for spot food/beverages (would be nice if they had a few more cups or minimal knife/tableware, but this isn't an extended stay or kitchenette room). Only negative was chintzy window roll-down shade behind the curtains. LOCATION: Fantastic !!! Walking distance to everything, or subway station entrance within 150 ft. Plenty of decent restaurants within 100 yds or less. NEGATIVES: Elevators are small, not overly speedy. Hallways are a bit claustrophobic. Various aged spots in the hotel that could use a touch up here and there. SUMMARY: The Wellington is not a 5-star, but you're also not paying 5-star room rate. If you're not a priss that faints at the sight of slightly older furniture or a spot in need of a bit of paint here or there, then go with the Wellington.

Went with my boyfriend and my best mate and her boyfriend. Booked standard room directly through hotel website for 4 nights. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms were basic but clean. The heating was on 24/7 and the room was baking hot even though New York was freezing cold! Even with the window wide open the heat in the room was a bit too much and you couldn't put your jumper, scarf and gloves on until you had left your room. On our 3rd night at the hotel i got a call from my friend (she was in seperate room with her boyfriend) saying that there was a mouse in her room! She reported it to hotel staff who said they would move her straight away to another room. They explained that as there is a subway right outside the hotel, they sometimes have problems with mice coming into the hotel. Apparently there are filing a lawsuit against the subway company for this? Anyway a member of hotel staff assisted my friend with moving her stuff and moved her into a 1 bedroom suite free of charge for her last 2 nights! The 1 bedroom suite was amazing (me and my boyfriend were so jealous and wished we had the room with the mouse!), the room had its own living area with sofa tv etc then seperate bedroom and bathroom but most importantly it had air conditioning!!!!! The hotel also refunded 1 nights stay back to my friend after her boyfriend told them he was not happy about the mouse situation. If you are going to stay here I advise you to pay the extra and book the 1 bedroom suite as the heat in the standard rooms was quite unbearable. I wouldn't recommend the cafe in the hotel, the hot chocolate was watery with no flavour and the food didn't look very appertising. The gift shop in the hotel is good to book taxi to airport and buy sweets, crisps etc. All in all other than the heating problems this was a reasonable hotel and good value for the money you pay. The best thing about the hotel is the location, you can't get any closer to all the action that here! I don't think i would stay here again as i would like to try somewhere different. I will definetly go back to New York again in the next couple of years. A must see is Woodbury Common Outlet Village, you pay $20 each (i think that was how much it cost) and get the bus from Port Authority. It is a big shopping discount village with shops like Lacoste, Burberry, Guess, Gucci, Ralph Lauren and so many more. It's a day out and is where you will get all your bargains! Lacoste polo shirts there were like $40 (\u00c2\u00a320) and here they are at least \u00c2\u00a370. It is crazy just how cheap you can get designer stuff here!

Despite other reports we found the elevators quite speedy and room was very acceptable with a comfotable bed and clean bathroom, excellent shower and hairdryer. Room was cleaned and towels changed daily. Must agree that room/hotel is best described as a little tired and new carpets and decoration would help. Room was very hot during evening and despite being on 24th floor, overlooking 7th Avenue, meant that having the windows open was not a solution as the street noise is just too much. All things considered, for the money and time spent in the hotel, it was good value and we would use it again because the location is just perfect. 2 blocks from Central Park (which is fantastic) and 10 mins walk into Times Square. Tips: Would recommend the Gray LIne hop-on/hop-off tour buses. We purchased tickets for 2 days (abt $49 each) which included the Downtown / Uptown / Brooklyn / Night tours which really give you an idea of the geography and saw all of Manhattan from the top open deck with excellent tour guides. Statue of Liberty - Try and get down there to catch the first ferry (08.30) otherwise the queues are very long. The Empire State Building is of course iconic but preferred the Top of the Rock, from which you get a fabulous view of the former. We did both, One at night and one during the day. Subway was fine, suggest a $10 metrocard which gives 5 journeys plus 1 free one. Food - we, like others read the guide books and tried some of the suggested best . Would endorse the Burger Joint inside the Parker Meridien Hotel. Don't be put off when entering the hotel, it's in the back left hand corner behind the curtains and absolutely the best burgers in town - 2 cheeseburgers, 1 fries, 2 sodas - under $20. Carnegie Deli - 7th Avenue opposite Wellington Hotel. As suggested by tour guide, if you want to try real New York food, then it has to be a Pastrami on Rye at the Carnegie Deli. All I can suggest is that you only order 1 between 2 as you really will not eat one by yourself, They are not cheap but they are unbelievable! Also, if you can get out to Greenwich Village, try Lombardi's for Pizza. Like the above establishments, absolutely buzzing and full of both tourists and locals - always a good sign. The taxi from JFK to the Hotel is $45 flat fare plus tolls and tips. Our driver avoided the bridge, but gave him $55. The reverse trip is metered so not sure whether more or less, but hotel staff ordered a \"town car\" (usually a black limo) for us at $55 all inclusive of tolls and tips.

This time a friend and I rented a non-smoking room with two beds and the rate was substantially more than I've paid during past visits. The rate increase would have been all right had it been justified by a room of quality. Our stay was for 3 nights beginning October 28. We arrived early and had opera tickets for a performance to begin at 1 p.m. The receptionist took our names and credit information, but could not give us a room number until later in the day so we left our luggage and left for the opera. When we returned, we were allocated the worst room I've ever had in NYC, and certainly the worst one I've ever had at the Wellington. The room was tiny with two twin beds on the 13th floor. Entering the room on the left is a small closet with a door opening onto the entrance way across from the small bathroom. If the closet door were left open, you could not open the bathroom without bumping it against the closet door. The carpets were stained. The room desperately needed painting. The woodwork was chipped. It was possible to open the window a crack in a lopsided fashion. This was important for ventilation because the air conditioning/heating unit was installed such that the lid could not be lifted to access the controls. There was in the closet an iron and a small ironing board. There was a hair dryer, but it was in bad shape and the pieces were loose. The vent in the bathroom was affixed to the wall with, I kid you not, gray duct tape. There was no counter space on which to place toiletries. There was no provision for coffee or tea, no cups. And, one night, there were no towels, an oversight not recongnized until stepping into the shower because the rod from which the towels are suspended is placed over the tub, behind the pulled shower curtain. As my roommate napped, I went into the bathroom and closed, but did not lock the door. My need for bathroom privacy turned out to be a big mistake because I could not open the door to get out despite all efforts. Fortunately, I did have a roommate, and I was able to bang and yell loudly enough to awaken her, and she called the front desk and a maintenance man came up and removed the entire door knob/lock assembly and replaced it with another. How long I would have been there had I checked into the hotel alone, I have no idea. I'm sure I would have missed the evening theatre production. Before catching our shuttle to the airport, I asked to speak to the manager. I asked if the hotel were under new management or had been purchased by some conglomerate, and I gave him my tale of woe. He was gracious and polite and assured me that he would see to it that the problems with the room were addressed, and he took $100 off the bill, which made the third night $211 instead of $311. For the things I like to do in the city, the Wellington is in a good location. I can walk to Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, the City Center, the theaters, and because of my past good experiences I will give it one more chance, but I will not recommend the hotel to friends and family anymore until I'm sure I can guarantee them a positive experience.

This was fully paid for in advance per expedia policy requirements. I ran the New York marathon on Sunday morning and was in the middle of a deep sleep that afternoon when I was woken up at 5:30 pm by an angry security officer pounding on my door. He demanded I leave the hotel immediately, alleging I did not have a reservation for Sunday night and was illegally occupying the room. When I tried to explain my 3 night reservation he became more irate and called the hotel manager who also demanded I leave the hotel. They then threatened to call the police, despite my showing them printed copies of the reservation. At this point, still being in a sleep stupor, I realized there was nothing I could do but pack my bags and find another hotel. Since it was the post-marathon evening, I sat in the hotel lobby for over an hour making phone calls to various hotels trying to find a room for the night. By the time I found a hotel, it had started pouring rain. Anyone who lives in New York City will tell you it is impossible to get a cab when it is pouring rain. The bellman, having been informed of my alleged \"illegal\" hotel occupancy, refused to hail me a cab. I ended up walking the 2 miles down 7th avenue in the pouring rain with all of my luggage. This story is already unbelievable and yet it gets better... Upon returning home, I attempted to get a refund from the Wellington hotel for the Sunday night I had paid for in advance through expedia. The front desk woman whom I talked to on the phone informed me I had actually stayed in the hotel on Sunday night and checked out Monday morning, and how dare I ask for a refund. The hotel manager then came on the line. She refused to believe my story and also told me I had actually checked out Monday morning. It wasn't until I threated small claims court and faxed over my Sunday night stay at the second hotel that they \"found\" my Sunday night check out form with signatures and grudgingly gave me a refund. I can't believe something so bizarre would ever happen to anyone else, but it does signal some large internal problem with the Wellington Hotel.

Travelling with my mum we were set for a shopping trip! The Wellington had been recommended by the travel agent as she had stopped their the previous year, and with an average price we thought why not. When we arrived at the hotel, it looked clean, neat etc all the important things, the check in was pretty quick and there were no queues. The elevators did take a long time as there were only 3 that were visible (However if you go right around the corner there are another 3!) We arrived at room 465 and this was when the problems started. There were curtains in the room, however we were only told they were there for a visual effect when we complained that there was no rail to pull them along, which was a neccessity as we were only on the 4th floor and overlooking an neon eaterie right across the road! The noise aswell was unbelieveable even when it is 3am taxi's dont see a problem blazing their horns! The bathroom was so small you could go to the toilet, wash your hands and have a bath at the same time! I cant even describe the heat in the rooms which was not needed especially as it wassunny outside. We went down and complained, and i have never spoken to such a rude person in my entire life, we asked to be moved rooms-she looked at us as we described the problems with the room and her response was \"what do you think i am- your maid?\" however after our 4 days in new york i soon realised that this was most native new yorker attitudes! We were then moved to room 675 after 2 hours of waiting whilst the young girl filed her nails and brushed her hair. We entered the room only to find an unbelievable smell, a mixture of menthol and moth balls etc. the bathroom was leaking water everywhere. There was an air conditioning vent in the window which did not work and again it felt as if it was the middle of summer in the room, the wallpaper was coming off the wall and there was damp and mold everywhere! However as it was now midnight we were exhausted with jet lag so we slept in the room until 4am when we went downstairs and complained. Expecting to find the rude girl it was quite a relief when thomas introduced himself and upgraded us FOC to a suite after everything that we had gone through. We then packed again and he moved us into room 901! Push for this room if you ever go as it was everything we needed, it is facing south so no traffic and no neon lights beaming in. There were problems such as only one light worked, one tv didnt work but after all we went through we did not care! we were not their to watch tv! When we went down for breakfast that very morning we got talking to a young couple and it turned out they were put in room 675 and it turned out that smell was infact rat poison and cockroach disinfectant! I couldnt run up to the shower quick enough! Overall the wellington in itself is an ok hotel if you push for an upgrade. You couldnt ask for a better location. The people in the gift shop were much more helpful than in the hotel, they told us where to go-where not to go, they organised a limosine for my birthday and for the airport, so if any questions you want to ask go to the people in the gift shop!

The foyer to the hotel was lovely, decorated for christmas and we were greeted with very friendly American bellboys. My room was rather spacious with a wonderful view of Time Square and the city. It was very clean and a maid cleaned the room daily. The ensuite was very basic but clean. The only problem if you are staying on the 16th floor or lower...you will be waiting a long time for the lift. The lifts get full with the people from the higher floors so by the time it reaches the lower floors it is full. A huge advantage is the location. Times Square is a 5 minute walk away and Central Park is a 5 minute walk in the other directon. To be honest New York is a brilliant city, with so much to see and to do we only spent our time in the hotel sleeping. A couple who we travelled with however were unhappy with their hotel room. They were on level 6 and the room was very small, the bathroom in particular was very small and the view was awful. I think The Wellington Hotel could therefore be a hit or a miss depending on the floor level you are placed on...but again the hotel is not an important part of a holiday in New York City.

The rooms are 'fit for purpose' i.e. they are warm, comfortable, thoroughly cleaned , although they could never be described as luxurious. Those who want luxury must pay for it, and the Wellington's rates are moderate for N.Y. I personally would rather be in that superb location in an o.k. hotel than be in a palace further out. My main quibble (and it is a small one) is that the lighting in room and bathroom is poor, so that applying make-up has to be done partly from memory! Our view was a brick wall, but as we only slept and bathed in the room, this was merely a tiny disappointment. Exploring New York left us so tired we came back to the room and immediately fell asleep. The Park Cafe on the ground floor is excellent.

Our suite was pretty large with a kitchen/dining area and a lounge with pull out sofa bed. The bedroom had a double bed (this was the American version of a double and came in at only 4 feet by 6 feet) and a single. The furnishings were clean enough but the furniture and d\u00c3\u00a9cor were from 30 years ago. The kitchen area was in need of a serious makeover to bring it into the 21st century. My brother in law and his family also had a suite but theirs was a lot smaller, with only a kitchenette and a bathroom you had to go through the bedroom to get to. My main concern was the windows that opened all the way up and the sills were well below waist high. With kids in the room that was on the 10th floor it made for some worries. All the windows appeared to be like this even the ones in the halls that looked out onto the airshafts. They only shut out about 25% of the noise and New York is a very noisy place (cabbies do like to use their horns), bring earplugs. On the up side the hotel is central for everything and only a few blocks walk to Times Square, Broadway and Central Park.

You expect there to be a smell of cigarettes but the decor was all stained, our door was almost hanging of, the carpet having been cleaned only highlighted the ridiculous amount of stains all over it and the view that we asked for was non-existent. Obviously we asked to be moved, which the staff were more than happy to do, (coincidentally, another couple asked for a change of room from smoking to non-smoking at the same time as us, which I thought was quite telling) The staff, however, seemed to be totally unaware of the state of the rooms, it was almost like they did not quite believe us. We got a much better non-smoking room, but there was a problem with the toilet which was never resolved, despite asking several times, stains, again, on the carpet, there were some exposed pipes and the AC was incredibly noisy. The attitude of some of the staff left a lot to be desired I must say.

Any further a field and you really need to use the subway. Checking into the Wellington wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to much of a problem, we arrived about 3pm and the queue wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to long. We got our room key and asked for a safety deposit box.

We were on floor 15, we got up there and were hit by the smell of cigarette smoke when we entered (we had booked a non smoking room). The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was very old and cheap, a knob was missing from the air conditioning unit and the bathroom was tiny! I could have sat on the toilet and washed my feet in the sink at the same time! We marched straight down stairs and asked to be moved. They tried to tell us that all the rooms on the 15 floor were non smoking rooms but the room had an ash tray in it! They moved us into a room on the 6th floor; this room was slightly bigger, with a slightly bigger bathroom. It was reasonably clean so we settled for this one. Being on the 6th floor come rush hour (starts around 6am) it was difficult to sleep with sirens, horns and general traffic sounds but you expect this to a degree in the centre of Manhattan. The air conditioning seemed to only function as a very noisy fan and had no effect on the temperature in the room, we complained about this the next morning and to be fair they sent an engineer up to the room who fixed it. One day we went to get our passports out of our safe (for ID purposes that night) and had to wait 45 minutes as the safe lock had broken and they had to get security and maintenance to break the lock! (It was beginning to feel a bit like Faulty Towers at this point). The staff were hit and miss, sometimes friendly, sometimes they just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care less. I complained about some of the problems we were having and a helpful man gave us free breakfast passes for the rest of our stay so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to complain if your not satisfied. The lobby was often full with people checking in and milling around. There was often a 15 minute queue at the desk which is a pain when you just want to put something in your safety deposit box. They have a cashier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk but I only once ever saw it manned in the 5 days we were there. The gift shop attached to the hotel is very good; they sell drinks and snacks and also sell tours, day trips and airport transfers. They were very helpful and very knowledgeable.

A few minutes walk to the Letterman Show...'nuff said. The physical location of The Wellington Hotel is terrific. Now, for the physical condition of the Wellington: Hit or Miss. We arrived out front (one way street) and an easy off load. We had an attentive door man. There are 4 or 5 steps up into the lobby. There is no permanent ramp, but I eventally saw a temporary ramp they can slap over the steps. The lobby was pretty nice. An older style, but what you'd expect of Manhattan in an earlier time (say, 1940's). We got our room assignment and a bellman. No one could break a $20 for me at the desk, which meant I was going to have to get change from the bellman after he got our stuff to the room. Awkward...A hotel in NYC oughta have some singles and fives on hand. The elevator was small, so my wife and I went up separately. The bellman would meet us there with the cart and bags. The hallways were pretty old and oft-painted. We got to the room which overlooked 7th ave. However, the room was tiny. I'd say less than 10' by 10'. We thought we'd booked a room with two beds. (We hadn't). But the bed provided was a double...for the both of us. My wife called downstairs as the bellman arrived who waited patiently. As she called to change rooms, I began looking around...the carpet was filthy. I don't mean a spot or two here and there...I mean dirty. As if you had an open bag of Kingsford charcoal and dragged it around. I never got to see the bathroom or closet. Overall, the room looked like a small, college dormitory circa 1925. Granted, we \"only\" paid about $150 per night for the place, but cleanliness and bed size is non negotiable at any cost. The woman at the desk was none too cheerful about it, but we got an immediate room change. She seemed to sneer at the fact that we'd booked the room online via Travelocity. With a room that dirty, she shouldn't sneer at ANYTHING. We had arrived around 5 pm...I wonder if we'd have gotten a new room if we'd come much later. We went all the way back down to the lobby, got a new set of keys, and went over to a separate set of elevators (apparently a different tower) and went up. The hallway was somewhat better than the previous, but the room was a pretty decent change. Everything had probably been redecorated in the past 5 years or so. Tan and beige. The room was somewhat bigger and the bed was acceptable (queen). I got change back from the bellman (ugh) and we unpacked. The closet was an OK size. The bathroom was definitely for one person at a time. Weirdly configured: No mirror directly over the sink, but one over the toilet. The toilet bowl was jammed against the tile wall, so you'd have to sit at a 45* angle when taking care of business. But, it was clean and reasonably new. There was no view, except of the brick wall across the way. I could barely tell if it was day or night, raining or sunny. No matter...the room was a big improvement in cleanliness, and a decent improvement in size. The television worked fine, the lights were fine, the carpet was clean. I could walk in bare feet. Not so the first room. There is no bar or any kind of hangout in the lobby. There is a breakfast place next door, and it is attached to a Greek restaurant if that's your bag. We didnt try either, tho they were both very busy. Immediately outside is a subway stop which we used to great advantage. I suppose to sum up, the Wellington is an OK deal ($150) if you're trying to save some money, are only travelling with 2 people, max of 3, and want to be near a lot of sights. I probably won't run back there anytime soon, and would prefer to spend somewhat more on a better place. If you choose the Wellington, get there early and FIGHT for a good room.

The price was good for us and after alot of research, I thought the Wellington would work. It wasnt the best out there, but certainly not the worst or so I thought. We arrived after midnight only to be told that our reservation was cancelled. There had been a problem with the credit card that was given. When I called earlier I had told reservations that the original cc used had been lost & should I give another one? They assured me everything would be alright and I could give them the new cc when we checked in. I even had my mom call from the agency just to make sure but, that was not the case. They ignored us in the lobby. I was surprized how swamped it was. We watched other people get rooms when they did not have a prior reservation. After many calls back and forth from NY to mom on the west coast & knowing that she was being put on hold for extended periods of time until Shantell assisted her. I must say she was very helpful and took control of the situation and cleared up the cc problem, rebooked us and put us in a room for the night assuring me that in the am they upgrade us to what we had orginally booked. That was fine, until we got into the room. Not only was it small, the toliet did not work, then I sat on the bed, the mattress fell to the floor out of the frame, (I am thin!)the sheets felt like there were crumbs in there, (upon further examination, the crumbs had legs!) & no towels at all. We called and they sent up someone for the toliet, but no towels. The rug looked like it hadnt been cleaned in forever, the air didnt work , the locks on the door were cheap and not safe at all & the room was just plain filthy. My mom called the front desk and was again put on hold for a good 25 minutes and was told that this was all they had that night and in the am we would be moved to a better room. We went back down there to see if they could do anything and was told no. Since mom had booked the reservation, I had her double checked on what the cxl policy would be if we checked out the next day, as far as she could tell, there would be no problem but, I was told they would be charged for the full week if we wanted to check out early. They assured us that we would be moved to a better room and this was all they had that night and just get through it. The locks were so old, we put our suite cases up against the door just to feel some sort of security. The lock on my bathroom had home was better than this one. Since at this point it was 2am, there was nothing we could do .The next am mom called to check on us being moved and was told sorry, they were sold out and we would have this room for the entire week. It was not what was booked and what we were going to be charged for!!! She asked the hotel about if there was going to be any penalties for leaving early and was told no problem.

Looking out the window all you could see were windows from other rooms about 20 feet away looking down upon a never built courtyard with no lighting filled with trash.

On Monday, 6/19/06, we arrived around 10:30AM, which is much earlier than the 3:00PM check-in time to be pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. Our room looked exactly like the King Room on their website. For the record, we were in room 451. I have stayed at two of the Helmsley Hotels in the past (Middletowne & Windsor) and the Wellington is BY FAR the best of the three. For an older hotel (as most NYC hotels are) they have definitely tried to maintain the character of an old hotel while keeping up with modern furnishings. The tile work in the bathroom was beautiful and spic and span clean...as was the rest of the room. I wish I would have gotten the name of our housekeeper. We left a note for her on our second day that we would like three more pillows and that our toilet was backed up. Upon our return, she saw us in the hallway and said that our pillows should be there and that they were there to fix the toilet. How she knew that we belonged to that room is still a mystery to me...but everything was done and we had no more issues for our remaining time. The people in the gift shop are also extremely helpful. We wanted to take the Subway to Yankee Stadium (great tour by the way!!! Ask to be included in Richie's tour! He looks like Babe Ruth and knows the Yankees like the back of his hand). Anyway, we were in NYC the week after the dude stabbed four people (one guy on the subway)...so we knew we wanted the \"direct\" ride on the subway...didn't want to deal with transfers. The guy in the giftshop wrote down for us which subway to take (the D train--two blocks from the hotel), which stop to get off for Yankee Stadium (161 St) and which stop to get off to get back to the hotel (53rd & 7th Ave). Now for the location of the hotel. If you're there for sightseeing there is NO BETTER HOTEL :) This hotel is about 10 blocks (10 minute walk) to Times Square; 3 blocks from Central Park; about 5 blocks from Rockefeller Center; and it's in the middle of all of the shopping you can handle. If you want to take the Double Decker Bus Tour, you catch it at the hotel right across the street!! The coffee shop in the hotel is good for a quick breakfast (that's all we ate there, so I can't comment on anything else). Also conveniently located right across the street is Starbucks. The ONE and ONLY somewhat negative thing I can say about our room at the Wellington, is the street noise. We were on the fourth floor so we heard quite a bit of honking...mostly our last night for whatever reason? But that definitely would not keep us from staying there again....to me that's part of the excitement of NYC! :) Some people have mentioned the slow elevators...our room was only accessed by the far elevators not in the lobby (located beyond the lobby area), we never had to wait for the elevators, nor had any issues with them being slow....but to this day (5yrs later), the terrible events that happened on 9/11 have made us much more patient people.

The safety deposit boxes are located here and also if you wanted to cash travellers cheques it was through reception only. Reception itself is far too small and there are not enough staff to deal with what is obviously a popular hotel, 20 minutes was about average.

We had planned our trip carefully, and well in advance; thus, we were skeptical having read several rather poor descriptions of the building, it's staff, and the overall experience of several travelers. Nevertheless, the price was right (through an Internet site, we paid $120 CAN/night [over a weekend, no less]), and as two university students traveling on a budget we resolved ourselves to endure whatever atrocity we might encounter. We stayed at The Wellington from January 26-30, 2006. I should probably preface my next statement with a disclaimer: I have never been employed by The Wellington Hotel. That said, I need to say that The Wellington was phenomenal. In retrospect, I am dumbfounded by some of the negative reviews I've read over the past couple months; perhaps these people were staying at a different \"Wellington\" hotel? Granted it might be disappointing if you were expecting, say, the Waldorf Astoria; however, if you NEED the Waldorf, then by all means pay $800/night for the Waldorf. If you're looking for a great hotel at an even better locale, then the Wellington is right for you. I'm not the type to habitually review every hotel I stay in -- truth be told, I've never \"reviewed\" a hotel in my life. However, so great were the differences in my preconception of the hotel -- based on several reviews -- from my actual experience, that I feel the need to lay to rest several of the trepidations I had. FIRST: Cleanliness-> I had read several reviews which suggested that the rooms were inhabited by creatures other than New York City travelers (i.e. bugs). During my visit, I did not see one bug, of any kind, at any time. We arrived before 3:00pm (the check-in time) and the room hadn't been made-up yet; however, as soon as we got there a maid was sent to prepare the room and it was ready within minutes. Every day, our room was cleaned and restocked. I admit, the decor is, umm, vintage? But let's not get petty; I suppose you might be a bit disappointed if you came to New York to judge hotel decor; but if the purpose of your visit is anything else, you'll find it in your heart to overlook this problem. SECOND: Service -> My girlfriend and I spent every day (from around 10am - midnight) out and about, so we didn't need to take advantage of many \"services.\" However, when we did require something -- a map, pen and paper, directions, suggestions -- the staff was more than willing to help, and was very quick with their response. I needed to buy a coat when I arrived (\"why\" is a long story), the staff member we asked gave us multiple suggestions of where to go, directions how to get there, and what time we should go to avoid the crowds. When we were checking out, there were no \"extra charges,\" like I've heard about, and the desk clerk ripped up our credit card copy in front of us to show that no charges would be added. Alright, there was a bit of a line in the lobby, but it moved quickly and I, for one, would correlate busyness with popularity. A lot of people from all over the world want to stay in this hotel, it's natural to expect some congestion during check-in and check-out time. THIRD: Tips -> Yes, upon check-in, the hotel staff gives your room key to a bellhop in order to force -- or coax -- you into tipping. Yes, you need to tip the staff for holding your bags on the day of check-out. Yes, you need to tip the doorman who gets you a cab. However -- and this is the key -- YES, you need to tip almost everyone, almost everywhere in NYC. It's just the way things work; if you want to avoid tipping, plan a vacation to Guam rather than 'the Big Apple.' FOURTH (and finally): Overall Experience -> Suffice to say, my girlfriend and I were more than impressed with the Wellington. The hotel's restaurant was affordable, quick, and relatively tasty. At night, our room -- despite some of the reviews -- was silent; we did not hear one siren or peep, for that matter, while trying to sleep. Most importantly, the Wellington is 8 blocks from every attraction you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to see in NYC. In sum, I would definitely stay at The Wellington Hotel again and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "February 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bogot\u00c3\u00a1, Colombia", "Title": "\u201cGuauuuuu hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4440590", "Content": "My wife and me were for 4 days.

We arrived at the hotel over an hour before check in time, yet when I asked about checking in to the staff they were more than happy to book us in there and then. There were no long queues at the reception desk contruary to what other reviews have said. Corridor leading up to the room looked like it hadn't been decorated for 25 years- our room on 16th floor was fine- again not the best decor in the world-I took my slippers and own towels, again after reading reviews but it was clean and maid service with new towels daily. We also had a fridge. Yes we heard the noise of new York city at bed time but hey if you don't like it then stay a little bit further out of town-or get some ear plugs. The wellington is just down the road from Times square so its not suprising that it's noisy. We also liked the cafe downstairs for breakfast and the staff there work their socks off- it gets very busy at peak times. On checking out, again we found staff to be helpful, and there was no queue- we checked out after breakfast and the staff looked after our bags- and booked us a taxi for later on in the day. The staff also ripped up a copy of our credit card details (which they had requested on day 1)infront of us to assure us that nothing had been charged to our account. Bear in mind though that you can't access the toilets in the foyer without your room key card but I'm sure they'ed let you use restroom if you asked at the desk. Overall it's a safe bet if, like us, you just want a central base from which you can enjoy New York city. We had a fabulous time! My tips are- empire state as the sun sets- no queue and you feel like you are on sleepless in seattle- very romantic. If you like people watching you will love grand central station on the lower dining concourse.

The Wellington, in sharp contrast, has a small efficient lobby, a diner, Mediterranean restaurant, and (Dave Letterman's) barber, gracious desk staff, can-do concierge, the best housekeeping/facilities staff I've ever encountered anywhere, and gargantuan old-fashioned-comfortable rooms. The thing is you have to remember you are in the big city, \"The Greatest City In the World\" even. Be aware of your surroundings, and let yourself fall into the delicate choreography of it all, and you'll have a great time. If you need something, ask. New Yorkers, and especially the Wellington staff, are very generous and very direct: step up, be polite, and you will get what you want. Make reservations ahead of time (esp. for livery service; it's a busy world out there), and show up 10 min. early. Have a destination in mind when you leave your room. Vacate elevators bays if you're not going to use them. Need directions? Ask the concierge; he has free maps.

Also there are only a few lifts so expect to queue or share the lift to maximum capacity most of the time. Our room was on the 17th floor and we were a bit worried when we got out of the lift as our corridor had seen better days, carpets need cleaning, there was a permanant nasty smell filling the air and we had to dodge huge trays of empty plates - leftover from room service to get to our room. Once inside our room it was a lot better although nothing spectacular. It was small but clean - with a maid service everyday for fresh towels etc. There is no air conditioning so even at the end of november the rooms were very hot which means you have to have the window open constantly which means noisy traffic outside. We didn't spend an awful lot of time in the room as there is so much to see and do and to be honest you couldn't get a better location than the Wellington. We basically walked everywhere as it is so handy for everything - Central Park, The Rockefeller Centre, Times Square and so much more are all in handy walking distance.

The location of this hotel cannot be beat. It is close to everything. The subway station is right underneath the hotel. Upscale shopping is only two blocks away on Fifth Avenue. Times Square is within a few minutes walk, as is Central Park. The coffee shop in the hotel is very convenient. There is also a 24-hour convenicence store across the street. I purchased two 1-gallon jugs of spring water there. The Mediterranean restaurant in the hotel is also very good. Try the fresh fish or lamb. There is also a good seafood restaurant near the convenience store with great prices for New York standards. The washroom was clean and the bedroom was small but cozy and clean. Fresh towels and toiletries everyday. There are payphones in the lobby for making local calls. Use those instead of the phone in your room to save some money. Staff was helpful. Make use of the baggage holding room if you are taking a late flight out of New York. The bell staff are always ready to assist guests but they will expect a tip, which is normal. Hotel is close to Broadway theatres, about 10 to 15 minute walk away, just past Times Square. I had a room on the 21st floor. When I put my head out the window, I could see Times Square on one side and Central Park on the other. Nice, but I didn't care much for the view because I didn't spend much time in my room. The water pressure was great, shower, toilet, and sink. I booked through Expedia which gave me a slightly lower rate than booking directly with the hotel. This is by far the least expensive hotel in the area. Sure, there are much nicer hotels for less money, but who wants to stay near the airport? I was right in the middle of it all. I saved time and didn't have to spend much money for taxis. Since this hotel is located on a main street, I felt safe walking out at night. Times Square is always busy and you should experience the lights at night. My room had an iron and an ironing table and some phone books in the closet and plenty of hangers. On the downside, the lobby is small and can get quite crowded at times. I didn't spend much time in the lobby. The elevators are also quite small and can get crowded during peak hours. The TV system was being upgraded so we didn't have TV for a few days but I didn't care. There's so much to do in New York. If traffic noise in the morning bothers you, ask for a room on a higher floor. 7th Avenue can get quite noisy after 9a.m. I never used room service so I cannot comment on that. The verdict: It's not a fancy place, nor is it luxurious by any standard. The carpet could use steam cleaning. The rooms are small. The TV is old and the traffic outside can get annoying for those who like sleeping past 9a.m. However, the location of this hotel alone would make me want to return. As a bonus, housekeeping was great. This is an all round adequate hotel which helped make my visit to New York extremely memorable.

I was immediately upgraded to a room with a kitchenette on the top floor, the 16th, no questions asked. Once in the room I again had to clean the tub area and dust/dirt started falling from the tiled wall once I poured clean water on that area. The carpeting in both rooms was very old, dilapidated and dusty. Looking under both beds revealed that those areas hadn't been vacuumed in years, that there were little things under the bed left by previous guests, and the stuffing was coming out of one mattress onto the floor. The a/c didn't work properly, temps shot up to 90 outside and at times it felt very hot in the room. The hot water faucet had air in the pipes and everytime I opened either hot water faucet water would come out, on and off, at very high pressure wetting my clothes. The high speed internet was just awful, extremely slow and would disconnect me when I was in the middle of my most important emails. What usually takes me an hour to do via remote connection at other hotels, took me 3.5 hours at the Wellington. The security chain on the room door didn't offer any sense of security, it's one of the 99 cent chains that anyone can push in easily. My keys stopped working and I had to stand in line for almost 20 minutes at the reception desk to get duplicates. For anything you need to ask at the reception desk, you must make a line of at least 10 minutes, they don't seem to have enough employees at the front desk. TV in the new room they gave me started acting up, several channels were all wobbly and hard to see for any extended period of time. Elevators are small which is not unusual in NYC, but the lack of a/c in the elevators and hallways made it unbearable during this hot spell. I guess it was due to the age of the hotel and its old windows that every noise that occurred on the street below (and I was on the 16th floor!) could clearly be heard in my room and woke me up at times. The location of the hotel is excellent, 2 blocks from Central Park, across the street from a subway station, food places everywhere, bellmen were helpful, lobby is spacious. My main complaints are the lack of cleanliness, the not cold enough a/c in the room, the old worn out carpets, and the extremely slow Internet connection. The rate was a very good rate, both rooms were spacious, the last room could fit two rollaway beds if needed. I'll probably stay here again but I'd bring plenty of Clorox towelettes and gloves to do my preliminary cleaning once I check in.", "Date": "June 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Helens, Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cNo Better Location!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3556329", "Content": "We stayed at the Wellington in May 2005 for 5 nights and had a brilliant time. The hotel is very old and some of the rooms do need redecorating, ours was one that hadn't been done, however, our room was right at the front of the hotel 17 floors up. This meant that if we stuck our head out the window we had Central Park to the right and Times Square to the left - excellent!!!! Our room was spotlessly clean and was cleaned every day we were there. The hotel provide shampoo/condition, soap and a hairdryer and iron - all in the room/bathroom for your use. The room was small and basic but adequate for the two of us who really just wanted somewhere to sleep and have a shower. It was also air conditioned - this was a bit noisy and we never used it, we just had the window open slightly. There is alot of traffic noise but that's everywhere in New York, and it really is the City that doesn't sleep. The Hotel staff were very helpful and will store your luggage if you arrive early or are leaving late, they will also arrange your taxi back to the airport if you ask them to (and it's cheaper than a yellow cab). We would advise you do the bus tour - you get tickets from the guys in red jackets hanging around Times Square, once you've got your ticket you can get on and off when you like during the course of the day, cost was $37 each and well worth it. make sure you get the Downtown Loop as this is the one that takes you in the Battery Park and the Empire State direction, North loop takes you up towards Harlem. The tour guides on the bus are very knowledgeable and it's worth the tour just for this, we learnt lots of things during the ride down to B Park and back. If you're going shopping be warned that New York is not as cheap as the rest of America. Electrical, music and sports stuff is cheaper but clothes not really - NY is full of designer clothes shops and expensive Department Stores - worth looking at but expensive! Also remember if you buy anything over there the prices on the goods do not include tax, that is added at the till. We changed all our Travellers Chq's at the local Bank who did not charge any commission. If you're going to the Empire State it's worth while getting tickets on line before you go, they are not dated and can be used any day you are there but it saves you queueing (huge queues) when you get there. Also, try and get there before lunchtime as it does get a bit crowded on the viewing bit. We didn't go the Liberty Island, I read a review on TripAdvisor that said to go on the Staten Island Ferry (which is free) and goes straight past the front of the Statue. It is only worth going to Liberty Island if you want to go to the museum and in the plinth, you get a better view of it on the S Island Ferry. Just towards Times Square from the hotel on 7th Ave there is a little Irish Pub which shows all the football/rugby matches - be warned, if it's a big footy match they do charge and entrance fee of $20 each. Most of the big shops are on 5th Avenue but Bloomingdales is on 3rd (we struggled to find it because of this!!). You can't get lost in NY as the streets are numbered not named and we found this a big help when we came out of Central Park at a different entrance than where we went in. There are loads of places to eat and drink, try Hoolihans Bar just off Times Square (signposted on T Square) as it's upstairs and at night you can sit by the window and watch all the hustle and bustle of T Square. T Square is as busy at night as during the day, we were shopping one night at 11:30 and it was like a Saturday afternoon on Oxford Street!! We would not advise you to eat at China Regency across from the hotel, we had never been to a bad Chinese restaurant until we went here. The Hard Rock is a good place to eat, food is lovely and it's 2 blocks away on the left hand side of 7th Ave if you are walking towards Central Park from the Hotel entrance.

For $219 for a King Deluxe room, you cannot ask for a better midtown location in Manhattan. The hotel is located minutes from Carnegie Hall and is only about a 4 block walk to Central Park (north); 2 blocks to the shopping on 5th Avenue (east); one block to Braodway (west) and about an 8 block walk to Rockefellar Center (south). You can also easily walk to Times Square and Restaurant Row. Their is a subway right outside the front door of the hotel, so you can pretty much get anywhere very easily. It was a $9.00 cab ride to the hotel from Penn Station, but had we known how close the subway was to the hotel, we would have used the subway. As for the hotel amenities, our room was very clean and had everything we needed including ironing board, iron and hairdryer. The furnishings in the lobby and the rooms are basic, yet functional. They are currentrly renovating the back elevator lobby. If you are looking for swanky accomodations, pay the $300+ per night to stay somewhere else. If you are looking for a clean, safe and functional place to stay for under $230 per night, this place is great. The bell staff was great and kept our bags safe while we explored the city both before checking-in and and after checking out. It is not fancy, but the staff is helpful, they have room service and you cannot beat the location. There is also a diner connected to the lobby with great \"diner food\" and cheesecake.

We were supposed to be at the Park Central Hotel across the street but the internet service we used: HotelConexions, screwed up our reservations and couldn't find us a room so we were forced to stay at the Wellington. We arrived late and to our dismay the room was too small for 3 adults. There was Zero room to unpack your suitcases and we were staying for 5 days. Even though there were two beds and 2 bathrooms, there was only 1 small closet, 3 drawers and one of the bathrooms was big enough only to brush your teeth. If you sat down on the toilet, you would bang your head on the sink (no exaggeration). The carpets were stained and the heating was cranked up too high. You couldn't turn it down because it was controlled by the hotel. We had to open the windows so that we wouldn't suffocate and the temps outside were mid 30's due to spring snow. One of the beds was sagging, the bedspread had a burned mark and the blankets had burn marks. The room was supposed to be non-smoking but there were ashtrays in the room. Needless to say, we were miserable. We arrived at 11:00 pm and couldn't do much so we talked with the staff the next morning. After a few phone calls back and forth with Hotelconexions (don't ever use them, customer service is horrible) and talking with the front desk staff, we got an upgrade without an extra charge. This was due to the staff at the Wellington not the internet service. The new room was much more spacious but still lacked in cleanliness. Under the bed there were potato chips and other filth. Obviously the cleaning staff does not vacuum under the beds. The heating is old and we heard a banging/clanging sound every night which woke us up each time.

Nothing fancy, but all was clean and well maintained. The location is superb, five minute walk to Central Park, 8 minute walk to Times square. The subway is next to the attached diner (Park Drive cafe) so no road crossing needed for subway access. The diner was excellent, good value and a typical American treat. We have stayed in New York at a much pricier hotel (New Yorker) and this was just as good.

After reading some of the reviews that people had written I wasnt expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was in a brilliant location just off broadway, 5 min walk from Times Square and Central Park. The Hotel had a large Reception area with pleasant reception staff who were always willing to help (If you are pleasant to people they will in return be pleasant back). Room was spacious enough for two people. The decor was 50's style which was in good condition. Bathroom was clean and spacious with everything in working order. Towls and bed sheets were changed daily. The room also had a hair dryer, ironing board and iron. The room was perfect for what we need (I mean how much time do you spend in a hotel room in NYC anyway) We ate quite a few times in the cafe attached to the hotel called the Park Cafe. The food was reasonably priced and they offered a quick and friendly service. We found the Bell Boys/Porters very helpful. They will happily call taxi's for you and help you with any bags. They day we left NYC for home was the day of the marathon so some roads were closed. We were flying at 6pm and the Porter happily sorted everything out for us. He spoke to the Reception staff and extended our check out time from 12pm to 2pm and booked us a taxi to pick us up from the hotel to take us to the airport. When the taxi arrived it turned out to be a lincoln limo. So we had a lovely relaxed journey to the airport for just a couple of dollars more than a Yellow taxi cab. I thought that the service we received at the wellington was well worth the money spent. When we book to come back again to NYC we will definetly book with the Wellington again. TIP: If it is your first time visiting NYC and you are landing at JFK Airport and need a taxi to your hotel make sure you get in a Yellow taxi cab these are a standard rate to any hotel in Manhattan of $45.00 plus toll. After you get your luggage and walk into arrivals some men will be waiting saying that they work for yellow cabs but they dont they walk you over to their private cars and charge you doulble what a yellow cab would cost.

Times Square,Broadway, 5th Avenue and Central Park are all within two or three blocks away. It also has a good metro station nearby which allows you to get on a train directly to anywhere in the city and the surrounding boroughs. ( As a sideline note here do not be afraid to use the metro it is cheap and quick). There are good restaurants nearby with menus at variable prices as well as some of NY's excellent deli's. The hotel had a restaurant and diner attached to it but I am afraid that I cannot comment on them as we tended to eat out away from the Wellington. Disadvantages: The hotel is very old fashioned, in order to get to the lobby you have to carry your luggage up a small flight of steps. The hotel has two sections, again linked by steps and therefore making it awkward if you have a lot of luggage. As with most New York Hotels within this grading the rooms are small. The Wellington, in common with many New York hotels, appear to have something against guests who book their reservations on the internet. Out initial room left a lot to be desired, with regard to decoration, the carpet was dirty and the bathroom even lacked a toilet roll holder. After complaining we were offered a room that had been recently refurbished and in fairness was very good for the price paid in respect of a central Manhattan hotel. My advice would be always insist on seeing the room first before signing on the dotted line. The main reason for not giving the hotel a three star revue is the staff. I have to say the majority of the employees were not the most helpful bunch we have come across. They appeared to find our room complaint a nuisance, and any assistance required seemed to be more bother than it was worth. A lesson at a charm school would not go amiss.

The hotel is two blocks to Central Park, six short blocks to Time Square, on two subways lines and within a few blocks of all (including the \"A\" line that goes to JFK airport), and on and on. A note for a delicious and affordable breakfast - each day we went to Smiley's, a small shop/store 1/2 block south of the hotel, for the perfect coffee, fresh fruit bar and made to order breakfast foods. Excellent hotel and I would recommend it highly.", "Date": "July 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "neill_mcdonald", "ReviewID": "UR2223767", "Content": "I stayed in the Wellington for three nights last week and thought that it was perfectly fine.

We were booked in to return following a trip to Washington and, rather than spoil our great holiday being involved in any hassle, did so. The plumbing was so bad in our second room (which had two double beds, a sitting room and a kitchenette) that the bathroom floor was flooded and had to be mopped with some of many spotlessly clean towels provided. The bathroom window wouldn't shut, which was a bit embarrassing - but no-one knew us. The carpet on the sitting room floor was damp, if not wet. So saying that the sheets were clean; beds changed everyday and there was a copious supply of spotlessly clean towels. The staff were polite and they looked after our excess baggage while we were in Washington.

So we made reservations there. The best prices were via the hotels website\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which is nicely done and easy to use. I am originally from NY so I knew that hotels can be a crap shoot. Fortunately, the Wellington delivered. The price I paid, 137 average for a 5 night stay. The staff was pleasant (NY standards...). However, the door men seemed distracted and were not attentive but they were more a security presence for me than someone to carry my bags. The hotel has three buildings. A north tower, South tower and a rear tower. I forget the name of the rear tower but when the desk clerk told me where the elevators were I felt like he was directing me to steerage on the Titanic. The lobby is substandard for the rear tower. It was hot and smelled like a boiler room. It is more like a back service entrance than a lobby. But, that said, the main lobbies are nice and up to date. Very comfortable with a touch of class and yet simple when compared to other NY hotels. The one nice thing to say about the rear tower is that we did not wait long for the elevator since it seemed like most folks were in the first 2 towers. The room was small but fine for a couple. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the (king) room with friends unless you are REALLY close. But the furnishings were up to date and clean. The bathroom was very nice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.except there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a ventilation fan in the room so a hot shower would make the bathroom a sauna\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.so we showered with the door cracked. The water pressure was good but the drainage was slow\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.typical of older facilities. The location is perfect. Remember I am from NY so I know the city. We walked to the west side, east side and even down to Wall Street\\Ground Zero (5 miles) from where we stayed. There is a 24 hour deli across the street with a 3.00 breakfast. Hotel is located 2 blocks south of Central Park and Carnegie Hall. For all you newbies, just think Donald Trump has a building in that area. It is in a good safe location. It is 13 blocks North of Times Square so we walked to our b\u00e2\u20ac\u2122way show in 10 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Restaurants abound in this location. The subway entrance is practically at the door of the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Q,N,R station which will whisk you to Times square in 5 minutes, where you can get any other line or just stay on all the way to Wall Street or the village. This location is the area you want to stay in NY! The East side is too business. Wall Street is dead after business hours. And the upper west and east sides only offer a few museums. This is the heart of NY. The Park Central is directly across the street....if you want 4 star. Overall I would give this hotel 3 stars based on the value. 5 stars for location. I would recommend it for the price we paid or less.

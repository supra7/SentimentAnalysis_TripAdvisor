Even though our room was upgraded because of being an agent, but I would still feel confident sending my clients here for a short term stay near LAX. We had no trouble finding the HIE, since the hertz rental car agency which we used was essentially right around the corner. It is an off the airport property hotel though and seemed to be close enough to LAX proper to use it as a quick night stopover, yet far enough that the planes were not flying 500 ft. overhead. The lobby was clean and bright with helpful staff, willing to fix incorrect name spellings and info., with no quams. Even received water bottles and granola bars upon check-in. Simple gift/sundries shop off lobby was a nice touch. Elevators, however, were relatively slow...maybe they need to be upgraded, not sure. Our room was clean with ample amt of space to move around and place your bags. Bed was a bit on the firm side, but since that's supposed to be better for your back, no complaints here, as I felt good in the morning. Since our room was a suite, there was separate living area with pull out sofa bed, chair, cocktail table, tv, and wet bar sink/fridge (empty). Sink area of bathroom was open, between the living and bed areas, and a large tub & toilet were behind a door. The room offered two types of pillows, each labeled firm and soft. The complimentary bath amenities were of decent quality and smelled fantastic. One downfall was that, of the two outlets at the sink area, one did not work. No biggie, just used the second one. Flat screen tv's were the standard here and there was a simple alarm clock. We arrived fairly late in the evening, so I cannot say much for the hotel's other common areas. Walked past a relatively small 24 hr fitness ctr with you basic cardio equipment (treadmill, bike, elliptical,etc). Hotel did have free wifi, and the code and password was given with your room key, however, I did have difficulty using it in our room, but that was likely an ipad issue I was dealing with. Complimentary breakfast was suprisingly nice with a decent spread. Coffee station, automatic pancake maker (never seen such a contraption before...cool!), cinnamon rolls, cereal, eggs/sausage/gravy, toaster for bread, eng. muffins bagels, a cooler with milk, reg and lite yogurts, cream cheese and hard boiled eggs, and a juice dispenser with at least 4 options. The free breakfast was continually be re -stocked and refreshed by staff and there was plenty of seating. Check out was quick, as they slide you receipt and final charges under the door of your room overnight. Did not seem to be a whole lot of parking available, but they assured us we could park overnight in their 20 minute only parking spots. Like I stated earlier, I would have no problem sending my clients here for a short term stay (1-2 nights) that was so convenient to LAX.

Cute place. White linen tablecloths, leather banquettes, excellent food, warm, welcoming staff. We are vegetarians and there was plenty of choices for us and even more for our meat eating friends. The menu was comprehensive and also included pizzas, they seemed to share space with Jinos, and we saw lots of people taking to-go boxes. Neely, the front office clerk, had also mentioned that if we showed them our room key, there would be a 15% discount. When we asked the waiter, he very cheerfully acknowledged the deal.

There was a free shuttle to LAX and with Holiday Inn I knew I was staying in a nice hotel. The room was very nice, it was quiet and just what I needed after a long bus ride. What I didn't need was a problem with getting my laundry done. I hadn't washed in a week so I had a fair amount to do obviously, and was excited that this hotel had laundry facilities on site, which weren't old but modern, when I checked them out. I only had $1.50 in quarters and needed about $4 to wash and dry the one load. The only problem was the hotel didnt have any quarters anywhere!!! How can you have a coin operated machine without atleast a bunch of quarters kept aside for guests? Normally I would just wave it off as unfortunate, but considering it is an LAX hotel they are always busy and people will want to do their laundry more so in a hotel here than anywhere. I said this to the girl, so I am not just writing it here without showing my dissatisfaction at the time about what was happening. This wasn't my real issue with them though, because considering i am a 26 year old girl from Australia, who was traveling alone (luckily a guy from my tour was staying there too coincidentally, as i bumped into him in the lobby), so he came with me on my quest to go everywhere from McDonald's (didn't have any), to gas stations and other hotels next door just to get the amount that was needed. It was 9pm at this stage and dark outside, so making me walk around at night to find quarters not only annoyed me but shouldn't be happening in any case, especially in an area that is kind of questionable at night. Overall, it was a nice stay there. I enjoyed the room and was able to relax once my washing was done, which is why I rated it a 3 and not lower. BUT if they are going to continue to use coin operated anything at this hotel, having quarters really needs to be a priority so no one else has to walk around at night just so they can do their laundry! Stay here if you know you won't be doing laundry, but if you are then make sure you have at least $5 worth on you.

Morning light showed the lobby to be a pleasant place with a small shop, business room and lounge with a big TV screen. My room on the top floor was clean and comfortable with a king sized bed, and a bathroom that appeared to have been renovated not that long ago and was one of the cleanest I've seen in such hotels. The room size was fine for up to two people. As I paid $75 per night I was surprised to find that this price included breakfast. There was a good range of food and it was presented neatly.

It is supposed to run each way twice per hour leaving from the hotel on the hour and half hour but this is not always the case. I had to wait 55 minutes for one at the airport end.

It took more than 15 seconds for the door to open (it closes rather quickly). I sure hope the reason that the other elevator is in the process of being replaced as everything else in the hotel. I went to my room and was shocked to find someone sitting in the room watching TV. The weirdest thing is that he even smiled and waved at me. I was very glad that he's dressed.

There is another Holiday Inn Express near LAX, so be aware which one you book at. I choose this hotel from the previous reviews and I got the impression from the reviews that it may have been a travel lodge at one time because it was not always listed under Holiday Inn Express locations. At any rate the location is perfect for a place to stay if you have to be up and to LAX Airport. The hotel is not in the flight path.In fact we were on the 6th floor and we could watch the planes come in for a landing The hotel is on the north side of the airport. We did not really hear the planes as we had the a/c on but I am sure it could get loud depending on the plane. We had no problems with it. There is a 7-11 adjacent on the corner of Airport Road and Manchester Blvd so that was great to pickup snacks or drinks if need be. Next to the 7-11 is a Sizzler Restaurant and a pizza place. The pizza place delivers to the hotel. But that is about it for a short walk. We did not venture any farther. There is a complimentary breakfast in the morning that consists of more than your donut and coffee. They had cereal, cinnamon rolls(yummy) scrambled eggs, toast and even bacon. It was sufficient to get you going in the morning. The bathroom was a good size and lots of counter space. Was not too keen on the shower head and our bathroom door handle was broken so the door did not shut completely. If we were staying more than one night I would have complained, but we dealt with it. They did give us a discount due to this issue when they found out during checkout. The TV did not have a lot of choice of channels according to my husband, but this hotel typically caters to business people OR people who need to stay close to the airport so I am sure the TV is not a priority. There is an outdoor pool and spa, although we did not utilize it. The beds and linens were very comfortable. Free internet and parking which is a plus. The rental car places are on the same road less than a mile, which is why we chose to stay here for one night.

However, hotels business centre provides free internet and printing facility which is great. And Wireless works fine in Lobby.

I was mostly interested in catching up on lost sleep after such a long flight, and HIE did not disappoint. Thankfully the hotel is not directly over the runway flight path (it is 200 feet off-center), so that made it somewhat of a quieter evening, as LAX has planes landing at all hours of the night and early morning. Restaurants in the vicinity (should you be without a car) are limited to Sizzler and the 7-11 convenience store. I tried but was unable to get the shuttle driver to drop me off at one of the Bus (Metro) Transit stations so I could use public transit. The only way to do this would be to ride back to the airport and catch the bus (or the free \"G\" Metro bus to the Aviation Metro station). Other places of note are a CVS Pharmacy which is 10-15 minutes walk up Manchester Ave, a US Post Offfice 2 blocks away, and the Hertz Rental Car Return Center.

The photos make the property look much improved. During our stay we noted that guests were allowed to smoke in the hotel, we are not smokers. We don't mind being around smokers but we could smell it in the air. The corridors were long and dark. During our first night there was a rather loud crowd in the hallway on our floor, and I thought someone was actually going to fell or be thrown through our door. The carpet was dirty, the baseboard carpet was different than the carpet on the floor, the curtains were different lengths, and I believe even a slightly different pattern. There were holes which had been patched on the wall and were just covered with plaster, the shower head was very low on the wall.

But we spent two days in LA and relied on public transport/taxis. If you have a car this hotel is fine, but if you don't then don't stay here if you don't want hassles. The foyer/lobby and the rooms were very nice, the breakfast was adequate but the service wasn't too good. For instance we weren't worded up on the shuttle and we sat at LAX one night for ages because you have to call for them to pick you up from the airport (we weren't told), unlike everywhere else where they run shuttles all the time like Radisson/Hilton etc for instance. Plus the conceirge wasn't too helpful about how we could get to Disneyland for example. The lifts are REALLY slow, but considering that was the only drawback to the actual hotel you can't really complain. And if you do get in a taxi and they have no clue where this is, advise them it is the old Howard Johnson hotel because we had a cab driver take us to the wrong hotel one night. Internet was free so that was a plus. We picked a car up on our last day in LA to drive to Vegas. We'd booked with Hertz and it was just down the road so we walked to the rental company. If you are willing to public transport it around from this hotel, get the shuttle to drop you off at LAX and then catch a (free) bus out of there to the transit interchange out front of the Lot C carpark for places like Santa Monica and if you are going to Disneyland catch one of the shuttles from there (about $15 each one way to Anaheim). Once we got a hang of the system it was fine but my advice is make sure you know the public transport. A 7/11 and Sizzlers is around the corner is you need dinner or have late-night or really early morning jetlag munchies as we did. There is also a giftshop at the hotel which had quite a good range of necessities, lollies/candy and souvenirs. One other thing, when you get off the plane at LAX make sure you jump on the right shuttle. We unwittingly got on the Holiday Inn shuttle and had to take a cab from there to the Holiday Inn Express.

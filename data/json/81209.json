Lots of magazines, a table and two chairs. The Wifi worked and the parking was free. Within one block there were lots of food choices. Cabs and buses right outside the door. The people in the office were nice and kicked back. The rooms are set around a really nice courtyard with a pool (warm enough for folks to swim in at night in the winter) with palm trees, water features, and art. Because the rooms are set back away from the road, there was no road noise. There is a restaurant ($$) and lounge along one side of the courtyard, and people sit outside. The lounge people party it up a bit, and there apparently was a wild time going on at night in the pool cabana, altho the motel warns you about keeping it quiet around the pool. Smokers have to go out in the parking lot. There are some street people in this area, but it wasn't bad.

We saw the tree, enjoyed a late lunch in Jack Foleys and then took the 28 bus to Japantown. 99 cents stores are now 1.50 but we had fun. The staff at the Phoenix were awesome.

I even went to the off licence across the street at about 2330 and it was completely fine. The hotel is secure, very clean and the staff are great. Buffet breakfast is good and you can either eat it by the pool or in your room. This is a city hotel - there is some street noise but no more than anywhere else.

I walked by a bunch of cool buildings such as City Hall, The Opera House, the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, the San Francisco Library and the Asian Art Museum.

The hustle, the bustle, the horns, the people, the buses, the trolleys are all great to look at. I walked all the way down Market stree to the Ferry building.

If you prefer one of the fancier parts of SF, this isn't for you. But if you're not scared of making your way around the Tenderloin, for example, you won't be bothered by the neighborhood. Second, the motel offers free parking. This was one of my main reasons for picking it. Third, there are plenty of places nearby to eat. It's not as lush in that respect as some other parts of SF, but you won't starve. Besides, there's a restaurant on the premises. Fourth, the rooms were neat and clean, with large windows facing the courtyard. It gets noisy in the evening, when the hipster crowd arrives at the bar, but the noise quiets down promptly at about 11 p.m. and wasn't an issue. Fifth, the staff was friendly and helpful. No complaints there at all. Bottom line is that it was a fun, different place to stay in SF. The room rate was quite reasonable for a SF hotel. I'd not want to stay there if I had business in downtown or the financial district, or if I were attending a conference at one of the business hotels.

The ceiling fan was a great touch to circulate the air given the hotel doesn't have air conditioning (not that it was needed). The only bad part - the room seriously smelled like incense.

It's got a history, which is great, but its not a nice hotel, and it's not a big deal. It's a motor lodge with the set of Gilligan's Island as your room decor. The bed was cheap and horribly uncomfortable. You could feel and hear the coils underneath. You're staying in the Tenderloin part of SF. It's skid row. Interesting, but if you're not used to what a real city is like and the inhabitants that make up the worst part of that city then stop reading and move on. The reason for the harshness is the price of this place. Our rate with the king room and upgrade was $159. Not sure what the upgrade was...TV? DVD player? There's very minimal parking with no security except for cameras. It's a motel set up with a very cool looking pool with lights and what have you but it feels like a hole. The noise from the street is inescapable. Sirens, crazy people yelling and people just talking. The room comes with a DVD player and a television. The TV is likely 15years old. Piece of junk, but it sorta worked. Picture was fine but no sound. You either have to play your own electronic device that you've spent all day worrying about getting ripped off from your room, or listen to the musings of skid row. The good, it's located in the city and you can do and eat lots of different stuff. It's got culture everywhere. Hit the streets early in the morning and you'll see the hookers getting out of jail. Culture is everywhere! The on-site restaurant looked very cool, very rock and roll and vintage. Would loved to have tried it out, but checked out a day early cause I couldn't stomach paying so much for the place. The staff is wonderful. We received a small bottle of wine and glasses upon entering the room. Nice touch. Staff was very helpful in showing us how to use the key card in the exterior gate. It's tricky. I drive a large SUV for work and the parking spaces are limited, and narrow. Coming back very late at night there was only one space available but my car would have been to close to the adjacent vehicles. There was a large amount of spaces being used by a single u-haul with 3 or 4 open spaces roped off. Apparently it's for bands that play nearby or there. But the night desk employee moved his car from the handicap spot and into the narrow spot so I could park in the handicap spot. I did, but he required my keys in his possession. I agreed but twenty minutes later I had to go down and get my keys back. That's weird and stupid in my opinion given the location. Bottom line a motor lodge type hotel should have enough spaces for the amount of rooms they have on site. The last thing that I thought was really bad and where I didn't get the best customer service was the amount of $ held on my card. I made the mistake of giving my debit/credit card upon checking in. I was told there would be a $100 additional hold for incidentals. Fine. After the first night I decided to check out early. We booked two nights but I couldn't stand another night. My travel companion asked the front desk clerk if there was a charge for the room if we checked out early. No, she was told. She ended up paying for the room. I believe we were given a 10% discount as well. But can't confirm. A few hours later I found out that my d/cc was charged $469. Two nights charge plus the $100 incidental. I'm sure this was a mistake, but very inconvenient to say the least. After contacting my bank and the hotel later in the afternoon I gave specific instructions to the hotel manager on what was needed to be done to release the funds from my card/account.

A view is always the cherry on top of my rapid rewards. That said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I tried something totally out of my comfort zone: The Phoenix. I totally get this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I understand what it is, and for whom it caters to. I saw Robbie Williams give a private poolside concert here in the late 90\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and since then knew it was the place to stay for music industry folks, musicians, and people that want to hang.

I was in room 40, which was on the end, next to the stairs, thus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was the host to everyone coming up and walking to their rooms. The windows are shuttered, so they may as well been open. The street noise was very loud. Carpet in the room needs to be updated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the rest of the room was very clean.

We were drawn to it by the free parking (as opposed to paying as much as $75 per night elsewhere), free continental breakfast, reasonable price and comfortable looking rooms. We arrived at noon directly from the airport. Our room was not ready, as expected. The staff (sorry, I've forgotten his name) was super nice (as was all of the staff we encountered), checked our bags, and allowed me to use the washroom in the office. Our room, on the second floor, was large and very clean. The large bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size, clean, and had great toiletries. Coffee maker available in the room. Lots of magazines and tourist information provided. Large closet. The complimentary continental breakfast was served outside in the courtyard. There was great coffee, tea, fresh juice, pastries, fruit and I think, oatmeal. Alas, no trays to bring it back to the room (we brought one down from the room to use). The weather turned very cold on our second day and it was rather unpleasant to stand outside. As the weather became cold and damp, as did the rooms. I should have asked for an extra blanket (I'm sure it would have been provided). The room felt a bit warmer on the third night as though the heat had been turned on, but there is no in-room heating available that you can control. There is a decent sized heated pool in the nicely landscaped courtyard. We did not use the pool, but many did during the warmer days. The courtyard was a bit noisy at night, but became quiet by midnight. The area the hotel is located in is a bit scary. There is government housing a few blocks away, many homeless people and prostitutes on the corner. Having said that, we were not approached or bothered by anyone. We had rented a car and did not do much walking in the area, other than to walk up the street to the Walgreens and a sandwich shop. A bit difficult to find a taxi though.

He sent us to Philz coffee shop a few blocks away - excellent - we returned several times during our stay. The breakfast in the morning was great and unexpected.

Yes, the neighbourhood is a bit dodgy and we ended up driving to attractions instead of using the pass we had bought as I was uncomfortable taking my 10 and 7 year old past some of the less fragrant denizens of Little Saigon. They ignored us and I'm sure that we would have been absolutely okay but we just felt a little vulnerable at times...like when we got the limited stop bus by accident and had to walk 6 blocks back up to the hotel. The physical location is pretty good in the sense that it is right in the centre of town and most places aren't far away by foot, bus or car. It is a short bus ride to the nearest cable car stop and two blocks to the nearest bus stop. But when you look at the lovely hotel, the comfortable and trendy rooms, helpful and friendly staff, the great breakfast and simply beautiful courtyard this outweighs the neighbourhood. We stayed midweek for 3 nights and didn't hear any noise at all. It really was one of the nicest places I have stayed in, not the most luxurious but definitely one of the most unusual with bags of character...which I what I wanted... you can find fancy 5 star hotels anywhere and they are pretty much all the same, you could be anywhere. The Phoenix has a natural charm you can't just manufacture. Check out the postcards for the original motel... a 60s insight! We will be back...unless of course it gets too popular so...shhhhh!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cI Love the Phoenix\u201d", "Author": "thirdpyramid", "ReviewID": "UR34597940", "Content": "I'm a little prejudiced, I met my boyfriend at a party there in 2000.

We had tickets for Wicked on April 30 and, of course, we booked The Phoenix, having had a wonderful time there the previous November. Our 20 year old daughter loves The Phoenix!

Once you enter the private courtyard at The Phoenix, you're in another world! Here's what you get: An incredibly clean, comfortable room, with lovely furnishings, wifi, in-room coffee, as well as a nice complimentary breakfast in the morning AND a very reasonable rate. Add in the superlative assistance at the front desk, a great pool and lounge area with fun statuary around, a relaxed, casual atmosphere, the occasional rock star and you have a recipe for a delightful get-away. And did I mention that there is free, and safe, parking? If you need anything, a simple call to the front desk takes care of it. Staff makes each and every guest feel special and welcome. As a member of the Joy of Life Club, we had a split of Chardonnay waiting for us when we arrived as well as a greeting card from the staff welcoming us to The Phoenix again. We also enjoyed a superb dinner at the Bambuddha prior to our show. They offer a blend of small and large plates and make it easy for a family to enjoy many different dishes. If you enjoy Asian fare, give the Bambuddha a try. You'll be glad you did. We already have another trip to SF planned in July so we'll be back to The Phoenix Hotel!

We were there for a party at the Bambuddha Lounge, a great night spot adjacent to the hotel. The decor is what you see in the pictures: a funky revitalization of a 50's style motel. Our room was basic but quite clean and comfortable. There was a faint odor of cigarette smoke, even though it was supposedly non-smoking -- but it was faint enough not to bother us (our friends were initially assigned a much smokier-smelling room, but they asked to be switched and were accommodated). The front-desk staff was generally attentive and polite -- especially the night clerk, Luke. We were mostly surprised by what a great deal it was. We paid $133 with our AAA discount, including on-site parking and continental breakfast. Usually when breakfast is included at places like this, you're lucky to get coffee and doughnuts. Although not lavish, this one still exceeded my expectations: laid out buffet-style by the pool, it included coffee, several types of milk (soy, skim, whole, and half-and-half), OJ, several types of pastries (muffins, croissants, danishes, raisin bread), bagels with cream cheese (you could toast them if you liked), and whole fruit. The only major downside is the neighborhood (the Tenderloin), which is down-and-out. Then again, since your car is parked right there with complete in-and-out access, you don't need to walk around.

Our bathroom was sparkling clean. Looked like new tile work. The included poolside, covered, under the heat lamp breakfast was very good for what it was. Good pastries, bagels, breads, surprisingly good coffee, juices. Just short on protein. Excellent, inexpensive restaurants nearby. Ask the staff. And, the neighborhood, while definitely big city gritty, never felt dangerous. Two minor quibbles: First, the jalousie windows didn't close tightly enough to stop a strong, cool exterior breeze from blowing into the room. But, the wall heater compensated (at some environmental cost). Second, either don't drive to the hotel or park your car once and take transit.

A free parking space comes with the room, but you probably won't need your own transportation once you're here because the subway and bus are within a couple of blocks, and much of the action is walkable. The hotel itself has a lot of character with a charming courtyard and pool, palm trees, and the occasional quirky Polynesian touch. Rock 'n' Roll is there to stay, too, with music recommendations in the lobby and, when I was there, a rock band tour bus-looking vehicle in the parking lot and a Smashing Pumpkins van.

One perk if you're staying in this hotel - you get free admission to the buddha lounge, adjacent to the Phoenix check in. It's a fun spot with really great music, actually. Didn't make it there the first night but stopped there the 2nd before bed and people were having a blast.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Del Mar, CA", "Title": "\u201cOld SF feel + tiki lounge style & hip elegance\u201d", "Author": "hcsminx", "ReviewID": "UR7245996", "Content": "I loved my stay at the Phoenix hotel. A friend of mine who lives in SF recommended the hotel to me. She mentioned it may not be a good place to stay on my business trip, however, I found it to be very accommodating and quiet. The BART station is just 5 blocks from the hotel - a nice brisk walk away. The Bambudda Lounge has excellent food (the best edamame ever) and provides a nice happy hour. The outside patio is very romantic- it has cushion seats, a warm fireplace and outdoor speakers playing soft tropical tunes. The pool is warm and clean. The teak lounge chairs that surround the pool area were a great place to enjoy the SF sunshine as well as the complimentary magazines that were in my room- Paper, 7x7, and one other. The staff was polite and attentive- they provided wakeup calls and recommended restaurants w/in the area. The room was bright, spacious and very clean.

It has such a great atmosphere. The rooms are always clean, and a nice size. The grounds are tropical and the rooms feel like you are on a tropical vacation with their bamboo, and ceiling fans. Since we are members of the Joy of Life Club (a free benefit) we get some freebies when we arrive including a drink and chocolate to start our stay. The free continental breakfast and a heated pool are great extras. No charge for parking is unheard of in San Francisco. And their room rates are unbeliveable. The location, right on the edge of the Tenderloine district, might scare off some but don't let it or you'll be missing out on a great place to stay. There is a restaurant on site, easy food like KFC and pizza just blocks away, or great restaurants just a couple miles away. The wharf is only three miles. And the staff is always wonderful.

But the Phoenix - I was very impressed. The courtyard/swimming pool area is beautiful and very relaxing. The room was spacious, clean and nicely designed. The shower was awesome. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy. I like the location - central to everything - on the edge of the Tenderloin but not in the worst part of it. There are many decent restaurants, bars and clubs within walking distance. The guests were, as a whole, quite young and hip. Because of the courtyard you don't get the street noise that you do in many other hotels in San Francisco. They let me check in quite early, which was very nice after a long, cramped, early morning flight from Chicago. My only minor complaints were that the room had only a small heater which didn't seem to work 100%, so I was a bit chilly for a while, and my room didn't come equipped with a frig, which would have come in handy. Also the only chairs in the room were made of bamboo and weren't very comfortable. But, I can't say enough good things about how awesome the courtyard area is. I'd like to go back when it's warm enough to swim. I absolutely loved The Phoenix, and will definitely stay there when I visit next time.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tenn", "Title": "\u201cLovely retro motel, clean and fun, good location.\u201d", "Author": "kelkel45", "ReviewID": "UR5613239", "Content": "Prior to staying at the Pheonix in August 2005, I read reviews on this site that warned of nighttime noise and other problems. While the place is famed as a rock-n-roll hotel (and the earnestness of the staff's rocker \"look\" is a little funny/silly), we didn't find it too loud at all. However, it's not the kind of place you stay if you're in town for early business meetings. We stayed up half the night entertaining friends in our room, but we did not receive any complaints from our neighbors, nor were we at any time disturbed by them. I remember from years ago that the hotel bar here was very fashionable, cool, and fun, but this no longer seems to be the case - it was pretty much a dud, very dark, deserted, and too loud. But the pool and pool area were lovely, the staff were friendly, and the room - while certainly not luxe - was clean and comfortable. It could have been a little bigger, though, seeing as how we had a king-size bed. See the attached, very blurry picture for an idea of how pretty the courtyard looks at night. The Tenderloin is wacky, for sure - NOT the cleanest or calmest of urban areas, but that, to me, is part of the experience. My boyfriend and I walked to and from the hotel after dark, but you may want to avoid doing this if homeless people cause you alarm. I would highly recommend the Pheonix for people travelling for fun with friends or partners.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Phoenix Hotel, a Joie de Vivre hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81209-Reviews-Phoenix_Hotel_a_Joie_de_Vivre_hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$133 - $206*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">601 Eddy Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "81209", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9f/0b/9f0b315493573368e256567c03d084034large.jpg"}}

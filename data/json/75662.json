The whole facility was clean and inviting. No evidence of wear and tear anywhere. The standard king bed room was spacious enough, equipped with refrigerator and microwave, and very clean and attractive. We had no problem sleeping -- the firmness of the mattress was just right. I did get annoyed a bit by some constant noise from the refrigerator (during regular operation, not just the cooling cycle) but that kind of thing is easily remedied (so long as one does not need to keep anything cool) by pulling the plug on it. Another option is to run the room fan constantly. For those who don't need a fancy meal, there is a Waffle House just a couple hundred feet away. And, of course, the Hot Start breakfast buffet in the hotel lobby, with a wide variety of offerings. We found scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, Cinnamon Rolls, and cereal, among other choices.

I arrived at the Phoenix airport and called the hotel for their shuttle service. The front desk agent asked for my name and directed me to the pickup location. The driver came within 5 minutes and took us straight to the hotel. The drive to the hotel was very short. Upon arrival the front desk agent had our paperwork and room keys ready so check-in was brief. When we got into our rooms, the lights and A/C were turned on for us ahead of time. It was about 80 degrees at 11pm! But our room was very comfortable. It wasn't freezing or too warm. The rooms were beautiful and everything brand new. The bed was amazing! I wish I could have one at home. I had the best sleep of my life! The rooms were large and it had a 32\" LCD TV. The breakfast in the mornings were also great. Lots of items hot and cold items. They also rotate the hot meats daily which was nice. They have a really cool pancake machine. You just enter the number of pancakes you want and they come out in a couple minutes. The breakfast attendant was also very friendly and helpful. One of my family member arrived late for breakfast but the attendant asked what they wanted and she heated up some eggs and sausage for them. They also offer room services and the prices were incredibly reasonable for hotel room service. It was the same as eating out at a restaurant. Which was very surprising. The late night snacks we ordered were very delicious. I highly recommend this hotel if you plan on staying in the Phoenix area.

And here is where my biggest complaint was - the shuttle was about 20 minutes late, which stressed me out a bit since I've never flown out of the phx airport and didn't know what to expect with increased security these days. I felt like the front desk should have communicated with the group of people waiting that the shuttle driver was running late. Luckily, when the shuttle came we were in the first group she dropped off. Also, phx airport security was incredibly smooth - the TSA employees were some of the nicest I've seen in the US and we didn't have wait too much at all. Anyways, the hotel room was exceptionally clean. The beds at Holiday Inn Express are great too - I can always count on a good night's rest at these hotels. The free breakfast is always adequate as well. This particular hotel had the new pancake machines - and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very easy to use and the finished product was tasty.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the level of service at an airport hotel, especially a happy hour with free drinks. The room was nicely renovated and clean, with all the amenities. I noticed that there was shuttle service to the airport which we did not use because we had a rental car.

We took the 6 am shuttle for our 7:50 flight. The shuttle was running a bit behind and we got to the airport at 6:20. I am glad we decided to give ourselves some extra time.

The bed was comfortable and the bathroom large. Shower had one of those great shower heads that you can now find at most Holiday Inn Expresses. Towels were very large and plush.

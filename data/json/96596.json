Our 2 bedroom deluxe is spacious and comfortable. We had requested a handicapped-accessible unit and found it very well set up for accessibility. We were in building 10 which is at the bottom portion of the property well away from the road. The building has a man-made bubbling brook between the buildings which makes it very relaxing to sit on the balcony. The property is maintained very well with our only complaint was the cold pool water. We also had a couple of families above us that could not walk softly at all. The resort should attempt to place families with children on the lower floors. The activities included breakfast and dinner shows on the property. We own at Wyndham and was very disappointed with the owner update. The representative used the relatively common practice of telling owners their accounts are not set up properly and then indicating he could help us if we would only purchase more points. Very disappointing approach that has become very common.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cOverall very good\u201d", "Author": "Creese21", "ReviewID": "UR139653534", "Content": "This was our first trip to Branson, and probably not our last. We chose to stay at the at the Wyndham based on reviews and on the overall look of the property. Please note, these condos are all for sale. For the most part, we thought the property was very good. The condo we were in was clean and had very little foot traffic in front of us. We had requested a quiet room and ... I think they did the best they could. There were two issues for us. First, the pool area is supposed to be non-smoking - the signs on the doors leading into the pools say no tobacco usage. Yet, they put smoking pots around the pool for smokers, which completely negates the sign. We had to leave the pool area one night because of all the smoking. Second, the walls and ceilings are paper thin. We were on the third floor and the room above was one of the sales showrooms. So, we heard a lot - I mean a lot - of foot traffic in the morning as they took people through the room. We ended up buying a fan to drown out the noise so it wouldn't wake us up. Ask for a high room. Also, remember, they sell condos here. So, you will be approached about getting tours and information. To avoid the daily phone calls, just unplug the phone when not in use - we didn't get one sales call our entire trip because of that. Again, overall, really liked the property and would stay there again.

Pros: The location of this property is fantastic, halfway between Tablerock and the strip. It is a bit farther from downtown Branson/Branson Landing. I much preferred staying in a condo to a hotel. The suites are quite nice and spacious. The beds are INCREDIBLE; so soft. The grounds are well maintained and picturesque. There are multiple swimming pools. The kiddie pool was perfect for our 3 and 1 year old children. Cons: Only one, but it was REALLY annoying....the time share sales staff. It's not what you think though. We did not take the tours, nor were we pressured to. There are NON-STOP tours throughout the day, with one of the stops being a model condo near our room.

I see that as a security/safety issue. That would have been beautiful at night IF you could see it. If you have a bigger vehicle, parking can be a little tricky. They were replacing large stair beams while we were there so be careful if you use the stairs at the ends of the complex buildings. Our first night we ran into problems. The bathtub was clogged and we had to call maintenance who arrived around 10PM. (There are no peepholes in the doors to see who is knocking on your door.) He pulled out tremendous amounts of black hair, which we had noticed in the back of the tub earlier. If housekeeping had done their job, they would have known the tub was stopped up (and he asked me to report it). He was extremely nice. Also, the lighting in the toilet/tub area is so dim, be careful if your going to shave your legs!!! The water pressure in the shower is not great, but the toilet will suck the walls in. LOL We noticed popcorn on the floor in the kitchen also, so I don't know how good a job housekeeping actually did except for making the bed and cleaning up the countertop areas which were VERY tiny in our unit. The bathroom vanity area lacks space if there are ANY women in your party. You really cannot cook in this unit even though there is a stove there. There is no prep space - maybe about one foot beetween the sink and stove. This was a unit for 4 people, but yet had only one couch in the living area. You would have to sit in a straight back kitchen chair to accomodate 4 people to watch tv. And you would have to pull the table to the middle of the living area if you wanted to seat 4 people around the table for eating/playing cards, etc. The table was really worn, which doesn't bother me, but if you are a resort you don't expect to see a table with unfinished areas, extreme scratches, etc., like it had been bought at a thrift store. The tv is not HD (doesn't bother me but does my husband) and the internet is soooooo slow I could get up and get dressed, put my make up on, come back and it still hasn't moved. We were there for 3 full days and struggled with understanding the wall switches for the lights. The last day I gently (I do mean gently) tugged on the overhead fan and the entire pull came out from the top of the fan, not just the snap chain. That could happen anywhere though. We heard just about everything that went on next door. We could smell their food coming through the adjoining door. I know when THEY ate popcorn. I knew if the kids wanted jelly on their toast, when they played/jumped on the beds, when they fought, when Dad talked to Mom, etc. And the AC was in our unit (apparently for both of the units) and was very loud everytime it came on. On the plus sides, the bed was very comfortable, there was a tv high on the wall in the bedroom (for a total of 2 tvs), and if you don't answer the phone they won't pester you for timeshare spills. The little bit of staff we dealt with, were nice.We can't really complain since our time there was given to us by a friend for our anniversary, but I do feel that the people that own timeshare there and others visiting need to be aware that this is an aging facitily.

Quite spacious and comfortable. There were plenty of ammenities, in-room laundry facilites, all small appliances (blender, etc.), pool towels, etc. Everything was clean, and in good condition except for our coffee maker.

Although the outdoor pool were not suppose to be open until May, they did open the main outdoor pool early so our kids were able to enjoy it during the hot days which was nice.

Basically, we were missing the Saturday night part of our stay in Branson. Upon check in I asked to have that night added to our trip. They couldn't do that. Apparently, there's a number you must call for reservations, the desk-workers can't make reservations. But, she did say she'd ask her supervisor (in the office directly behind check-in) who didn't have the courtesy to come speak with me, only told the desk-worker \"no\". I said, fine, please call so I can add the additional night. The call was horrendous. Basically, no customre service. They only add nights with a 2 or more night stay (ummm...I stayed with 3 night on the forward side of this reservation and an addition might behind it???) and could only give me the room if I paid for 2 nights-almost $400. All this in a military \"friendly\" town. This was our last family vacation before my husband deploys for Afghanistan and the hotel couldn't give us the missing night we needed, even though there was vacancy.

At check in they told us they had to charge a $100 deposit to a credit card for each condo that they would later refund if there was no damage. I have never heard of a place charging your card $200 and then refunding you 7-10 days after you check out. Normally most places just take your credit card and then will charge you if there is damage. Just a way for them to make interest on your money. The check in was incredibly slow and I kept having to repeat information as they kept getting our name mispelled. I specifically requested when we reserved the condo's to have them close together as I have 4 children that we had to split up. The closest they could get us was in the same building but on seperate floors. Once we arrived at the condo we found the condo was very musty, dirty with bugs in the tub, bathroom sink was clogged, and a/c was not working at all. I called the front desk at 4:30 and they were going to send maintenance up to look at it. We waited and waited and finally called the front desk two more times and it was not until 11:00 pm that maintenance finally showed up to look at the a/c. Maintenance guy said he could not fix a/c and would have to send a/c technician out tomorrow to fix. It was 80 degree's already in the condo and smelled musty. Front desk did offer to move us 1/2 mile down the road to another condo, but only had one condo available. That obviously would not work since we could not be that far apart from our other kids. Needless to say we did not sleep much the first night. I actually contemplated sleeping in the car as it was so musty smelling. Second day a/c tech did come out and fix the a/c. Sink never did get fixed. That night we went to a show and arrived back at the condo around 10:30 and found no parking at all. We were told by security that they were parking guests at the welcome center and a shuttle would take guests to their condo. It was pouring rain that night and we had to park several blocks away from our condo and take turns being shuttled by a golf cart in the rain at night back to our condo. The next morning my husband walked the several blocks to go get our car and bring it down to our condo so we could load our luggage. However, he found that the resort shuttles were all parked behind our car and had to wait over 30 minutes for them to be moved in order for us to get our car out. We complained numerous times to the manager Becky Guthry but she could care less since we were not owners at this resort and they already had our money. This was the worst experience at a resort we have ever had. Motel 6 would have been nicer than this place!! This resort is old, run down and does not care about it's customers at all. It is also in a very inconvenient remote location. Please do not waste your money here. There are so many other nicer resorts that care about their guests.

I proceeded to sleep the next three nights on the couch. Talk about a great vacation! We ended up leaving 3 days early mainly due to the bed situation. We couldn't handle it anymore.

SO where do i start? The bed was the worst matress i have ever slept on, after examining the matress i noticed it didnt match the box springs so that may be a sign in a cheap replacement. There was not a hot tub at the resort but they were so nice to have a tram that would drive you 2 miles away to one at another resort (much needed after a night on the rock bed). I prefer one onsite within walking distance but to some people it wouldnt matter. We got back to the resort Sat night and there was not a single parking space so we called the front deck and ask what to do, they sent security and the nice lady that came said its an ongoing problem and no one seems to care so just park in the No Parking Zone-(the\" towed a owners expense\" sign worried me a little) so i went to bed with my fingers crossed and she was right the car was still there in the morning. Overall the room was nice and clean, I would have thought they would have opt for a tv bigger then 19\" but hey i was on vacation and wasnt there to watch tv - so as long as it told me the weather i was fine. Once you climbed into the rock bed and turned off the light you was welcomed with the nice bright glow of the outside hall lighting but that wasnt a big deal to me but to some it may be a problem if you like it dark. We were lucky enough to have good neighbors that was gone alot but if they had there tv on or they were talking- we herd it. The walls are very thin and if you got stuck next to the wrong people it would be a mojor problem. We checked in on Friday and ened up leaving on Monday and surrended our other 4 nights due to the fact we just couldnt deal with the bed situation and would rather just pay for a different room where we could sleep. I have stayed at many Wyndham resorts and will more then likely stay in many more but this one is NOT what we normally get, we were thinking maybe this area was newly purchased as an addition to the main resort and they havent got threw the growing pains of it yet- you check in about 2 miles down the road at the main resort and that is where everything is at so it makes since that this was an afterthough.

We were more than pleased both times we stayed, which I guess is obvious since we have booked another trip. My twins were a little more than a year old the first time we stayed. It was great to have a condo where they had a room for naps and we could still watch t.v. without disturbing them. That never would have happened in a hotel room. Both times we were there it was two cold for the outdoor pools to be open, but they looked very nice. We took advantage of the indoor pool several times during our stay. They do have a hot tub, but it is located outside. That was one thing that I wish they would change. It would be great to be able to enjoy the hot tub during the winter months. The kitchens were very nice. It allowed us to eat breakfast and sometimes lunch there instead of being out the expense of eating out the whole time. Overall, we were very pleased with the grounds. We took several walks outside to look at the ducks in the pond and of course play on the playground. My favorite part of the stay was the jaccuzzi tub in the master bedroom. I took advantage of the tub almost every day of our stay! I was also pleased to find a tanning bed and game room on the grounds. The tanning bed was a little expensive, but gave me a great way to relax while my husband and children were napping. On a couple of occassions, I also visited the internet room - where they have three computers and printers set up. It was a great way to research a couple of things while we were there.

It was booked thru RCI and promised to be a Gold Crown property. Through no fault of Wyndham, we could not have picked a worse week to visit Branson--the temperatures were in the low 100s every day-Whew! However, when we checked in, we were told that one of our children and family would be right next door to us-actually one was above us on another floor, and one several doors down. It worked out well, but interesting that the resort had promised one thing which turned out not to be. Upon arriving and during unloading his luggage, our son locked his car and room keys in his running car(his mistake). As he was waiting for AAA he found a coat hanger and tried in vain to unlock the car. As this was happening, his wife was sitting outside (extremely hot!) and noticed at least 2 motel personnel drive by in their golf carts--no one stopped to ask if they could assist them in any way. We find this unacceptable by any stretch of the imagination. Our daughter, upon checking in, found a very dirty kitchen floor with black footprints-since they have a one year old who spends lots of time on the floor, they called housekeeping and a gal was there right away, and hand mopped the floor--housekeeping and maintenance were always spot on. (We know, since we kept them rather busy)! Our first problem came when the light cover in our shower fell down!! Thank heavens we were not in the shower at the time! Imagine our surprise!! We then went to visit our daughter and family, and found that the light cover in their shower had also fallen down, and just missed their teenage daughter. Our son-in-law put it back up, and then the shower door fell out of its tracks! The day before we left, their cover fell again. The showers are poorly equipped for an older or physically handicapped person, as there is nowhere to put shampoo, gel, etc. save for a tiny place which held a small bar of soap. Our son had to call maintenance for a garbage disposal that would not work, and our daughter, as well as my husband and I had to call for help as we were getting very little air conditioning in our units--both conditioners in each unit were found to be not working properly because of filters inside which were clogged with dirt. After replacing those, the air conditioning worked properly. Our feeling is that all units should have WIFI, or at least connections to the internet--in this day and age, many of us travel with our computers to, at the very least, check our email, and print our return boarding passes. The Meadows has a small room with two computers, no word-processing software attached, and 15 minute limits for use. This included children who were playing computer games and unsupervised by parents. The day before we left, our son-in-law went to print our boarding passes, and found the printer to be broken. He went to the front desk and asked the clerk if she would print the boarding passes--she said she could not do it. He then went to the manager and asked if she would print them, which she did. One last problem--we were housed in the same complex as the Sales Offices--therefore the elevators were often tied up with salespeople and their prospective customers. As hot as it was at the time, this was definitely an inconvenience--there are stairs of course, but since my husband is physically challenged, this was not an option for him. On the plus side, the rooms were very spacious, well equipped with everything needed for preparing most any meal. A large table, and eight chairs and a bar area served our family well when having everyone together for a family meal. There was a whirlpool tub, and large vanity off the bedroom. The TVs were very nice and easy to operate, and there was a nice patio with chairs and tables. The baby pool was wonderful.

This is strictly a review of Fairfield at the Meadows and we are not familiar with the other properties there. This is important too because visitors are not supposed to use the facilities at the other Fairfield Resorts but if you are staying at the Meadows they have everything one could want. Our main reason for coming was that we had gotten a discount package to tour a Grand Crowne resort (separate review) which didn\u2019t hold a candle to Fairfield. We decided to add on a couple of days at Fairfield to use up some leftover points. As we arrived we noticed that the place was beautiful as usual. Even though it is still technically winter, Fairfield took advantage of the unseasonably warm weather to plant many beautiful flowers and have their fountains and streams up and running. On our way into the check-in area we were made to feel like royalty with instant service, super friendly attitude and copies of their activities schedule for the week and our room key of course. We were told that they had just won Fairfield\u2019s \u201cPineapple\u201d award. We took the elevator to our 4th floor 1 bedroom deluxe-A room near one end of the building. \u201cDeluxe\u201d means it includes a whirlpool tub for two. The room turned out to be a handicapped room which means it had low closet hangers and shelves and a special shower as well as a lower kitchen counter. A separate countertop microwave is available if needed. Everything was very spacious and I would count it as 4 distinct rooms: Kitchen, living room, bedroom and large bathroom for the two of us. We were each even given a check-in bundle which included, a razor, shave cream, tooth paste and brush, etc., etc. and a chocolate turtle candy (too bad my wife doesn\u2019t like nuts but I sure do.) I found nothing wrong with the room although my wife thought the water smelled stinky and she noticed a few dirty cups in the cupboard. It probably would have been better to have at least asked us if we would prefer a regular room since my wife did find it difficult to wash her hair in the handicapped shower. A couple of lights went out at different times which might have been related to the storm. I thought there ought to be a bathroom light switch that could be turned on from the bedroom but all of the light switches were on the bathroom wall by the door from the living room. It wasn\u2019t a real problem at night because the light on the side of the wall mounted hair drier served as a night light so you could find the switches by the other door but a three way switch would have been a nice touch. From our deck we could see the lighted fountain as well as the brook running between the buildings. Since it was rather slow, I don\u2019t think anyone was directly across from us but it did seem a bit close if there had been anyone there. All of the services are found in centrally located separate buildings. There was the registration building which probably also offered tickets for sale (who doesn\u2019t in Branson). Then there was a separate Member Services building where we talked with our coordinator. Then there was a main staffed recreation building which had the indoor pool, game room, exercise equipment and outdoor shuffle board. The outdoor pool and hot tub were still covered and there was another outdoor building probably for seeing preview shows in warmer weather. We weren\u2019t in any hurry to see the shows since we knew we would receive some free tickets from the time share tour at the other resort. I decided to enter the pool tournament which was fun even though I didn\u2019t win. The next day the weather was so warm that we decided to go hiking on the other side of the dam. Later we went to a show and when we got back to our room, there was a message that we were under a tornado watch. We turned on the TV and got an update about the time the local siren went off and there was another call from the front desk advising us of the tornado warning and where to go to take cover. Fortunately the storm missed us. For attending a \u201csurvey\u201d session, we were given a $30 coupon towards dinner at the Chateau on the Lake which we took advantage of on our last night. The survey is a \u201csoft sell\u201d but we were happy to be assigned a regular coordinator whom we can contact with program and other questions. We actually made a second appointment because we still had questions and they were all very graciously answered by Nic. Most of the \u201cBig Name\u201d shows had not opened for the season yet so if you really want to see those, it is best to wait until April or May. But there are so many shows to see in Branson that we had no trouble finding great shows that we had never seen before. But the best part is that there was almost no difficulty getting up and down Country 76 (\u201cthe strip\u201d). There was also no need to make reservations or buy tickets way in advance in order to get great seats. Branson was just a whole lot more \u201claid back\u201d in March than during the prime Summer season, or Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I do have to say the staff are very nice. The Beach Party Show was great. We were put on the Meadowbrook \"owner\" side. The bathrooms were filthy. Dead and LIVE bugs in the shower and bathtub. Stool on the toilet. TV's are cheap, DVD barely worked. Master bed mattress old and saggy very uncomfortable. Website shows 2 beds in 2nd bedroom and we get one for my kids to share. The pool is dangerous. They have 2 pools that have these 3 steps and waterfall in between with a \"watch your step\" sign. Accidents just waiting to happen. Not to handicapped friendly either. It was nice they had plenty of activities to do. We will either go back to the Horizons, Big Cedar, or Chateau on the Lake.

We were able to park directly outside of our first floor lodge. The only quarrels we had were the 4 PM check policy was etched in stone. So, don't show up at 3:30 PM, your room will NOT be available. They also required you to strip the beds of the used sheets and collect all the used towel. These are things that typically taken care of at a normal hotel stay.

Location was excellent, service was good, but the room was small and very noisy.

Also, we could hear every word spoken in the room adjacent to ours (particularly those spoken at 3am!). In hindsight, I'm sure we could have asked to change rooms, so I certainly don't fault the hotel. Just beware of it if you are not a heavy sleeper. The building is aged and some areas could have used some work, but the views were unbelievable from the higher floors, so it's worth asking for something with a view if you will spend any time at all in the room.

Saved me close to $134.00 over the convention rate. I was asked if we wanted a king or 2 double beds, I requested a refrigerator and was provided with one at no extra charge. The only thing we kind of wanted a high floor but were put on the 12th. It was at the end of a hall very quit location. We did find if we cut thru the room where the ice machine and pop machine, and then thru the stairway landing, it was a bit shorter than going around the maze of hallways. Requested late check out on sunday, were given an extra half hour, they did store the dance conventions participants luggage in a ballroom until we left, although where our groups was wasn't really monitored very well, and we weren't given any luggage tags. Used the pool early Saturday morning while my daughter attended class, very nice, would have liked to used the hot tup but unfortunately 4 very hairy guys were occupying it, each on a corner, and there was no way as a female I was join that group. Even when they got out they sat right on the 4 corners of the hot tub. I feel this was rude, and it wasn't Marriott's fault, come on guys you weren't the only ones at that hotel. Saturday evening my daughter and I ventured by the pool area, and the hot tub had been drained and was closed, I don't know maybe too much hair from those guys.

We just happened to stumble upon the snow sculpturing contest taking place at NP, felt kind of bad for the participants as it had been in the mid 40's and sunny on friday.

I had the privilege of having lunch in the Marriott restaurant upstairs with friends. Everything that came out was well priced (i.e., not a huge hotel price rip off) and looked up to par as far as presentation. Everyone liked their food and what they ordered, more or less. Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel restaurant again, I would have. Everything was great. The only downside is, I found the elevator system a bit confusing.

I needed Internet service because I was here on business. It didn't work in the room, and when I called about it, they connected me with a technology representative (a very friendly guy in Guatemala - seriously) but he was not able to fix the problem after an hour.

Two hotel employees mentioned that they were having problems with Internet in the rooms. I was able to get wireless in the lobby and the 2nd floor, at no charge, but at night in my jammies, that wasn't much help.

The wifi is great in the lobby and the immediate surrounding area of the lobby, but access in the meeting rooms is minimal or nonexistent (not the \"free wifi in all public areas\" that I read on their website). Our wifi connection and consistency was so poor that my colleage actually paid the $14.95/day to have a plug-in connection in her room, and she said that was horrible too.

Though recently renovated, the rooms still had popcorn ceilings in the bedroom and in the bathroom. The bathroom was reeeaallllyyy small. The toilet almost touched the door and it was impossible to shower with the door open because the tub ran right into the door.

I haven't had the need to go to Chicago so often, and haven't been since May 2010 until this weekend. I have to say, this hotel has gone downhill in less than 18 months. It used to be a well priced, above average Marriott in the middle of the Michigan Ave. action, but is now a total dump. We reserved two executive king \"suites\" but were shocked to find out they are actually the same size as the standard rooms, but arranged slightly differently. The wallpaper was peeling in many places, and not just a little bit. The carpet was stained and the tile was cracked. There was dust everywhere, including on the extra blanket in the closet. There is a small couch in the room that folds out in to a double bed, but why pay an unnecessary premium for an executive king \"suite\" and just book a standard double room instead? The bathrooms in this hotel are TINY, to the point where it's difficult to stand in front of the sink because the toilet juts out of the wall so far. The shower handle was literally falling off the pipe and many of the tiles were cracked or chipped. The toilet had no water pressure, while the shower was blasting your skin off. The toilet paper holders are pointlessly placed underneath the counter, and if you have never stayed at this hotel, you might have one of those \"uh oh\" moments looking for them. I also want to mention how thin the walls at this hotel are. The people next to us decided to have a party at 1:30AM and I had to call security three separate times to get them to shut up. We could literally hear them screaming about giving more shots of cognac and yelling \"chug, chug, chug\" as someone did a beer bong... Not acceptable. There is a Starbucks located in this hotel, but please, PLEASE walk across the street to the Intercontinental (or just stay at the Intercontinental) and go to their Starbucks. The staff is actually halfway intelligent there. Twice I went to the Marriott Starbucks and got unbelievably rude service from a group of women who were obviously more interested in talking about their personal lives than helping customers. And twice, my drinks were completely wrong. I didn't even bother asking for them to change it as it would have involved a lot of eye rolling and questions that I wasn't in the mood to answer. We are Marriott Elite members and tried to check in at 11:45 at the Elite counter which doesn't open until 12 noon, but seeing as there were three or four employees just standing around chatting, we decided to give it a go. One of the women chatting turned to us and gave a great deal of attitude about the desk not opening until noon and how we were early and wouldn't get our rooms anyway (which we did) and that she wasn't punched in, etc., etc. Totally unnecessary; I would have been fine if she simply pointed out the time, but she went on... and on... and on.

Yikes!\u201d", "Author": "red_x_oktober", "ReviewID": "UR119273607", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel on October 5th for a business conference. The GROUP rate for a regular room exceeded $250/night and I was associated with a pretty sizable conference. I'm glad I was on an expense account. I'm not sure what is par for the course in the heart of Chicago during the business week. I stayed at a comparable Westin one weekend in Chicago at a much more affordable price for a major urban area... The lobby was very impressive and had a open floor design with a very modern, urban feel. At the center of the lobby is a great wrap-around bar, plenty of tables, arm chairs, and more isolated booths for meetings or catching up with work. A wall of TVs by the bar can keep you up to date on sports and other news. A full-service Starbucks is also in the lobby for your coffee cravings in between meetings. Its a busy place, but it was a good place to relax. Free wi-fi in the lobby was also nice. But at this price, it seems absurd they would charge you $15 for 24 hours of internet. By the way, you do get charged for internet in your room. The elevators in the hotel are totally confusing. There are multiple sets of elevators each with a different function... Some take you to higher rooms, some to lower, and some to the conference spaces. Pay attention before you get on one set as they may not take you where you need to go. The room was a little small but the bed was comfortable with very nice bedding as is usually the case at Marriott. (I had a room with two doubles.) The desk area was awkwardly positioned in front of one of the beds and the office chair was constantly in my way as I navigated around the room. Technology-savvy business travelers with laptops, phones, and/or e-readers needing charged will be annoyed with the one set of outlets by the desk area, which are somewhat awkwardly positioned under the desk opening. I had to do a search around the room for another outlet as you won't find one on your nightstand, either! An armchair, end table, and lamp could be found in the corner at the far end of the room, but they were so awkwardly placed that it seemed like an afterthought. You couldn't really sit and watch tv from this position, and the short ethernet cable at the desk meant you couldn't work from this space either. The bathroom was nice and very clean, but very small compared to other urban hotels I've stayed in and there wasn't a toilet paper holder in the bathroom. The toilet tank apparently performs this duty instead of the traditional holder under the vanity... Seemed strange to me. I had a room that adjoined to another room and I was not associated with that guest despite the fact that I had to deal with her loud phone conversation for about an hour during the evening. I don't know if it was because we had adjoining rooms or if the walls are simply thin, but she might as well have been making the call from my room... Annoying. I have no complaints about staff. Everyone from the bellhops to the desk attendants to housekeeping was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Great quality of service across the board from the staff I experienced during my stay. The location in the heart of the Magnificent Mile is great. You are in easy walking distance to so many great restaurants/shopping and cabs are always available out front in Cab or car service from O'Hare will set you back about $50 so factor that into your overall cost. You can count on a 40 minute ride from O'Hare depending on the time of day you arrive.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAverage, for the price\u201d", "Author": "maa-maa", "ReviewID": "UR119153194", "Content": "I found nothing in particular to dislike about this hotel, but for the price we paid (Fri-Sat night stay) I can't say that I was particularly impressed.

We were delighted to snag a four-star hotel with a perfect location -- access to excellent shopping by going north on Michigan, or to the business district by going south and over the river. When I checked on the rack rate on the Marriott site, the best I could find was $254 a night. So in that context, it was absolutely worth the price we paid. The staff -- from the front desk to the bellmen -- were warm and friendly, making us feel very much at home. For example, when we asked about a place to eat breakfast, a bellman said we could pay $28 for the brunch within the hotel, or we could walk across Rush Street and get a great breakfast at Cosi for a fraction of that. There was a disconnect between that kind of warmth and the hustle-bustle of the giant lobby and the multiple banks of elevators that took us to our room on the fourth floor. The room itself was tiny, but the king-size bed was wonderful. The bathroom was rather ordinary for a four-star hotel, too small for my wife and I to occupy at the same time, and equipped with nondescript white linens. The decor was forgettable, but it did have a nice view facing the Chicago skyscrapers to the south. All in all, we got more than we paid for. But if we had paid the $254 rack rate, I think we would have been disappointed, especially at the cramped quarters. Finally, we found the electronic climate controls annoying. But that seems to be increasingly common among big hotels. It got hot in the night (even though temps were in the 40s outside), and all we could do was keep punching the electronic thermostat toward 60. It seemed oblivious to our attempts to coax cool air from the ducts.

Thinking there had to be alternative benefits (breakfast in the restaurant, drinks at the bar...anything!) I inquired and was told rudely by the \"Elite Check-In Desk\" staff that they would not offer me anything else, other than the Spartan \"Welcome Amenity.\" Not taking this without more inquiring, I called guest services and was given the same answer. Clearly they encounter upset Elite members on weekends and are ready with their abrupt and non-accommodating responses. My beef isn't as much with the lack of club access, but with the lack of notice by the hotel with my confirmation and the lack of an alternative benefit to make up for it. Had I known this in advance, I would have stayed elsewhere (and I assume they know this...thus why they don't tell you). I am Diamond with Hyatt and Gold with Hilton and have never run into this before...without at least some other benefit to make up for the lack of club access. Clearly the Marriott Downtown Chicago does not value Elite guests...at least not on weekends. As for the rest of the hotel, it's fine, but nothing special.

However, be prepared to shell out a hefty $26 per person if it's not part of your room rate. My assessment...I won't stay here again.

It's just across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel where we have stayed before. The room at the Marriott was larger and nicer with better quality showerhead than the Intercontinental and we'd likely stay at either hotel again but really preferred the Marriott for the room size and nicer, newer bathroom. It is a HUGE hotel. The lobby renovation has made the hotel feel much more vibrant and enjoyable to enter. The bar in the middle of the hotel is an OK circular bar. The front desk clerk was friendly and gladly accomodated our request to be as high as possible with a room on the 25th floor. As Priceline bidders, we had to take a double room which was OK because of the increased amount of space. The room, 2534, was very nice. Spacious, great view of Michigan Ave. Nice sitting chairs, comfortable desk and a bargain at $109 a night. The bathroom was very clean, nice bowed out shower, good water pressure, separate mirror and sink which was nice convenience. Beds and linens were top notch and very comfortable. Valet parking is $48 a night. Self park at the lot 1 short black away was $33 a night if your ticket was validated by the hotel. I commend the hotel because when we checked in we were asked if we'd self parked and were informed of the $7 a day discount off the $40 a night self park. Brand new equipment in the fitness room. The pool is nice, narrow but long. At 10 pm on a Friday there were too many kids in the pool to take a swim. It would seem like it might be a good idea to offer and adults only swim time from maybe 9 p.m. until the 11 pm pool closing time.

We needed to use the low-rise ones based on being on the 16th floor. However, at times, we would have to wait 5-10 minutes for the elevator. It made running down to the lobby to go to Starbucks out of the question. There was no quick way to leave the floor. We often had to wait in lines in the lobby to catch one back up. They really need to get this corrected. - Small bathrooms - Costly parking ($48 for valet per day) - Pulling up to valet is difficult as the drieway can only hold 4-5 cars. The street (Brush I think) gets backed up waiting for cars to turn into the hotel. - Pool was closed for one part of the weekend while they tried to determine the cause of some mysterious bubbles on the water surface.

On the one hand, the location is outstanding. Walking distance or a very short cab ride to almost every major downtown attraction and a bevy of outstanding restaurants including GIbson's Steakhouse and La Frontera. Not to mention the shopping on Michigan Ave. Hard to find a better location. On the other hand, the service left a lot to be desired. First, the hotel cancelled our reservation by mistake. We found out about this when Marriott.com sent us an email saying I had cancelled the reservation. As I said, this was their mistake. Mistakes happen, but when they do you expect hotel staff to go above and beyond to make up for their error. Instead they first tried to pin the blame on me. After \"doing me a favor\" to see if there was any availability, I was told that I was lucky to get a room since \"this is a very busy weekend.\" I ultimately found a manager who took the time to investigate the problem and to read the emails that I received from Marriott. He admitted that the cancellation was the hotel's error and apologized for his subordinates' performance. To his credit - and I do have to give him a lot of credit for this - the manager gave us a major room upgrade to make up for the problem and the poor way it had been handled by his subordinates. The manager seemed genuinely disappointed in his subordinates and equally genuine in his desire to make up for the problem. I'm grateful to him, but it should not have taken a high level hotel manager to address this problem. The facilities were very mediocre. When we got to the upgraded room, almost the best the hotel had to offer, it smelled like a gallon of sour milk. We called housekeeping, and they replaced the room's refrigerator and deodorized the room. Again, a good response, but how is it the housekeepers didn't notice the incredible stench when they cleaned the room? Aside from the smell, the upgraded room (a king suite) was nice, but it felt a little like a set from L.A. Law. I'm sure it was truly outstanding in the 1980's, but in 2011 it's dated and rundown. Indeed, all of the hotel felt like it had last been renovated in the '80s if not earlier. Finally the lobby bar was crowded, noisy and expensive. We tried to have a drink after a day of sightseeing, just to be surrounded by drunken, noisy and fairly obnoxious conventioneers. Ugh. We visited friends at the Hyatt Regency, a place with a similar bar set up as in the Marriott, and found that the Hyatt's lobby bar was quieter and more pleasant even though it was also full. All in all this was a clean, conveniently located hotel. Neither the facilities nor many (but not all) of the staff were of the caliber I would have expected from a major downtown hotel. I think that the nearby Embassy Suites or the Hyatt Regency would have been more comfortable.

Walked from the train's Grand Station, arriving at the automobile court. Several bellhops immediately inquired if I needed assistance with my two bags (one on wheels, the other tethered to it). Lots of smiles and a warm welcome, with specific instructions on where to find the reception desk. Checkin experience: Neva was so cordial and friendly! She upgraded my room on the spot when I requested it. Room: Typical of large-city hotels, the room was rather small, but more than adequate for my needs. I had a king room on the 37th floor, with a west view. Floor-to-ceiling windows added to the breathtaking view! The bed was incredibly comfortable and loaded with extra pillows. The linens were in excellent condition and spotlessly clean. The desk was a bit worn, and the room safe took a while to locate... it's in what used to be the bottom drawer of the nightstand: the drawer has been turned into a door. :) Bathroom: Perfectly clean, but tiny. And I mean tiny. The door barely clears the front of the toilet seat. Single sink vanity with lots of counter space. The tub seemed a bit old, but it was spotless. Curved shower rod with updated shower curtain. Public areas: Clean clean clean! Elevators are \"divided\" into low-rise and high-rise. Conference center: Confusing! There is an extreme lack of signage and wayfinding - to the point that Marriott employees were actually always on-hand to guide people to the correct rooms/floors. Seems to be a waste of human resources, when appropriate and adequate signs could provide that service! Escalators in the conference area totally skip the 6th floor - and I never found the stairs so getting an elevator was sometimes a challenge, especially during busy times. Lobby bar: Great service, even when it was packed with conventioneers! I highly recommend the chips-n-fondue and the mini Chicago-style hotdogs. Be sure to try their site-made honey beer (there are 100,000 bees on the roof of the hotel). Harvest: Second-floor restaurant. Great food - superb service. Chef's salad was a bit of a disappointment, though - I was expecting something other than iceberg lettuce. The chicken & mushroom sandwich is very tasty. I had the house-made potato chips, but my traveling companions had the garlic cheese fries and said they were quite good as well. Checkout: I requested a late checkout of 1:00 (normal checkout is noon) and was immediately accommodated. When I realized 1:00 would really be pushing it, with my conference schedule, I called to see if I could back it off until 2:00 and was denied. I checked out with three minutes to spare, and stored my bags at the bellstand - as much as that goes against my grain. Departure: Bellhop hailed a cab the instant we walked out the door, telling the driver which airport we wanted, and double-checking that he took credit cards. All-in-all, I'd definitely stay here again. As always, the biggest downside of staying at a Marriott is the ridiculous daily charge for Internet service (here, it's $14.95 for noon-to-noon service).", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Modern Rooms\u201d", "Author": "HumJer", "ReviewID": "UR98153963", "Content": "This place has some of the most modern looking rooms I've been in recently.

I told them I knew I had booked at their hotel and I used their 800 reservation number to book. They suggested that I called them and find out what hotel I was booked at. I did and found out I was booked at that hotel on that date. They asked to talk to the lady at the counter. I handed her my phone and after saying hello twice she handed my phone back to me and told me it sucked. I asked if we could call their reservation line using the land line, because I wasn't getting much of a signal, which she didn't even respond to, she just told me she had to go check something and left for 20 minutes. She found someone else and they tried scanning my credit card and it came up with another guest that was checked in already. They asked me if I was with that person, whos name was very similar to my last name. I said no. They asked a few other questions and then told me that didn't mean anything. I begged to differ as my credit card should not be attached to any room other then mine. They thought it would be reassuring to me to say the card wouldn't be charged. What I really wanted to know is how or why it happened. Finally a manager came around and found a room for me. He was the only helpful person I ran into. It wasn't the room type I booked or at the rate I had booked. All night long kids were running up and down the halls screaming and they seemed to not care. At the front desk they just said they had a lot of complaints about that. They told me I would have to call back the sales department on the weekdays to find out what happened to my reservation. I called back monday morning and they didn't really ave an answer for me. They said it looked like they were right at the hotel and the reservation never made it into their system. They told me that just because you have a confirmation number for your reservation does not mean you have a reservation. They told me that most of the times their reservation system works, sometimes it doesn't. I should call before I leave and make sure the hotel actually has a reservation for me.

The only solution was to sleep without any heat running - it was stifling! However, I never got cold - there were lots of extra blankets and bedding in the closet.

My husband stacked two hotel pillows and felt fine with that. Many, many thanks to whoever recommended breakfast at Mary's Cafe (about 2 blocks from the hotel) on their TripAdvisor review. It was quaint, incredibly fast and relatively inexpensive. (Our breakfast arrived within 5 minutes of ordering it the first day.)

I would definitely recommend getting the bus everyhwere - dirt cheap and frequent. 20 minutes to the Museum Campus with direct buses from Magnificent Mile Hotel itself - wireless costs $14.95 for 24hrs but surprisingly they advised me to just use the lobby area as its wireless was free! Swimming pool was a let down - quite small but still adequate and the whirlpool was out of commission. Male locker room has steam room which is fine.

There is no microwave to warm up the muffin. I had to tell them that the coffee was out. One of the most irritating annoyances was the elevator. Everyone complained. Although there are supposedly 6 going to the rooms, I never saw more than 3 at one time--that is, if the elevator is crowded, wait and you will always see one of the 3 coming and going. The most extreme case I heard was a friend of mine who took 10 mins to get from his room to the lobby. My negative experience with service was when my laundry arrived as I was waiting for the elevator. One of the guests waiting with me said--he's knocking at your door. I did not want to acknowledge that because I did not want to miss the elevator. That man refused to budge and shook his head to ask me to open the door for him. He was obviously expecting a tip. The elevator arrived, I left. That evening, there was no turning down of my bed. The fact that the complaints remained the same suggests that management is not taking the service issue seriously enough. And the reason that management does not take the service issue seriously is that the hotel is aiming for the convention crowd.

I will qualify what I say by starting with the ability to receive a room on the 40th floor with a view of the lake. Maybe this shaped my experience. First, the check-in staff was lovely and helped me change my assigned room to a room with a view even though I arrived late. The bed has a topper that makes the bed very comfortable. The floor to ceiling windows made you feel connected to the outdoors unlike token windows in some hotels. The room was spacious, included a nice robe, and lots of pillows. The bathroom may have seemed small if more than 1 person in there or if had to close the door a lot. But the vanity was marble and had plenty of space to spread your items out. The shampoo and conditioner were aromatherapy products. And I got turn down service with chocolates (at the end of my stay, there was a sign by elevators saying this was a club floor, so perhaps I got a great upgrade). The starbucks in the lobby had many workers and was quick. They carried all the extra sandwiches and yogurts that starbucks now sells. The lobby downstairs is consumed with a huge bar section with multiple televisions. This adds a festive gathering place if you didn't come with a companion. Further, the hotel lobby has entrances off to 2 major roads in town and allows you to quickly stroll around town even if you are alone. If I was planning a conference, this would be my choice. Great layout of rooms with circles of couches and chairs everywhere for easy socializing.

January 1st 2009 Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member I had a reservation at the Chicago Marriott Magnificent Mile checking in on January 1-3 2009. Upon check-in the young lady was wonderful. She noticed in my reservation that I'd request a complimentary upgrade IF it was available. There was availability for an upgrade and I was very happy. This was a treat to myself for New Years staying on the magnificent mile in Chicago). My sister and I checked into the room which had a wonderful view of the city. However I was a little disappointed with the room considering I had just stayed at the Marriott Atlanta Airport on New Years Eve and the room was simply beautiful and they had just been renovated as well. My sister and I decided to go to the bar for drinks. YES, it was crowded/busy. We stood at the bar for 10 MINUTES while the bartender totally ignored us. We were standing behind 3 empty bar stools and watched the bartender take orders from the guest on both sides of us. (left & right side) We watched the bartender go to the other side of the bar to wait on another guest and we were there first. Finally, 2 men who were also guest at the hotel came over to us and said We've been watching you ladies stand here asking for his attention and the bartender continued to ignore you. One of the men had to literally get the bartender attention and said to him these ladies have been standing here waiting to buy a drink for atleast 10 minutes or so. YES, that's when the bartender came over to serve us AND YES he saw us standing there trying to get his attention before the nice men came forward. I was very embarrassed because I'm also bragging about how nice Marriott treats it guest and especially their Elite Members as compared to Hilton. I tried to speak to someone about my concerns but there was only ONE person at the concierge desk and he had LONG LINE and the young lady who checked us in was only the young lady working checking people into the hotel, her line was long. There was 2 or 3 empty positions with nobody working/standing there to assist the guest. If they were working they didn't come out to help the young lady . I have stayed at several full service Marriott Hotels and I have never seen only ONE or TWO people working when it's extremely busy especially during the holiday season. If there's more than three people in line at a full service Marriott you will definitely see another representative come out of the office to help out. Therefore I just gave up. I wanted to stay there for New Years Eve and I'm glad that I didnt. The rooms are over priced for it's decor. and I am talking about the concierge floor room. The hotel was suppose to have been renovated. Perhaps they need to visit other Marriott hotels to get some ideas. I would have been very upset with myself if I had moved forward with my plans to stay at this hotel for New Years Eve only to be disappointed with my room and the AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE that my sister and I recieved. I am NOT going to discuss the service during breakfast in the resturant upstairs. The food was great the service was awful. This was very embarrassing and especially being a Platinum Member with Marriott. I've been an elite member for 4 or 5 years and this is truly a disappointment. This was my first time ever staying at this hotel and was looking forward to staying there. On the internet the rooms looked great and just being on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago I really expected everything to be on point and it wasn't.

The vegetable sides were inventive and never boring, and the entrees and desserts were fabulous. The second reason this is above average is, of course, the HUGE advantage of its location smack dab in the middle of the Magnificent Mile.

You really can't beat the location, as the hotel has two entrances - one from Michigan Ave. and one from Rush st. Everything is right at your doorstep...shopping, restaurants...and most of the sights aren't very far away from you either. The only bad thing was that we couldn't get a room for love or money that had a king bed, and it became apparent from the first night that the double bed (which I was guessing would be more like a queen), was WAY too small for both of us. Aside from that, the room was nice and clean, with great beds and not-that-great pillows (we found them to be way too soft). I do agree with everyone who has written about how tiny the bathroom was, you can see it in my picture, but there was enough space to put things on the counter. The room itself wasn't too bad though...most people thought it was small, but I found it to be the same size of a hotel room that you would find in any big city in a downtown area. We found the concierge staff to be extremely helpful also. Every day we talked to them and they helped us find restaurants, tickets to different sights and attractions and even bars and clubs. Plus, we found out great info like the fact that the Institute of Art was open from 5-8 pm on Thursday and you could get in for free. This hotel is VERY busy though. Big groups of people attending conferences and the like bustle around the lobby day and night. We didn't find the elevators to be a problem at all, like some other reviewers had commented. We were on the 34th floor, so we would have noticed something like that. We did have a little misunderstanding when it came to the parking situation though...we were told that if we self-parked the car in the adjacent lot to the hotel it would be $30 a day and when we checked out we found out that it's actually $36 a day. It was extremely easy to get around Chicago (we bought a two-day pass for the El/Bus at the \"Jewel Osco\" store right by the hotel) and the concierge staff had maps and helped us get to where we needed to go. The only minus that we found was that you could hear sirens more or less every two hours around the clock...even being on a high floor didn't help the sound.

On more than one occassion it took about five minutes for one to arrive on my floor. I was up high on the 35th floor. Not sure why it took so long. The club lounge on the 2nd floor is very good. It's for Marriott Gold and Platinum members. Good bfast, happy hour and deserts. The hotel restaurant is also on the 2nd floor. Again very good food. The 9th floor is where the pool and fitness center is located. They have a large cardio room with lots of equipment, and a large weight room. I was always able to get on the equipment without waiting during the busy after work rush from 5:30-7:00pm. The pool is small but works, the hot tub was hot. NOTE: When I was their the pool would fill up with kids and parents after about 8:00pm when they all came back in from sightseeing and dinner. The rooms are small, and the bathroom was smaller. This is an oolder Marriott that they did renovate with all the new Marriott bedding and fixtures. A family of four would be a tight fit. But the room is functional if you are by yourself on business. Location, location, location. This hotel could not be in a better location for vacations or business. You can walk to all the attractions on Mich Ave and side streets. It's two blocks from the river and you could walk to the loop if you wanted. Cab ride to the board of trade is $8.00. The staff is efficient and friendly.

Everyone from the bellmen to the front desk staff to the room service staff was outgoing and seemed genuinely happy to have me as their guest. I would recommend this hotel!", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cOur Fifth Anniversary Celebration\u201d", "Author": "NaptownTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR17248127", "Content": "Due to rising costs of flying, not wanting to be too out of range of our little one, and a smaller budget this year, our fifth anniversary turned out to be just a weekend and not a whole vacation. As a result, we looked for something fun and undone by us. We have shopped and explored downtown Chicago, but never stayed at any of the fabulous hotels. Every brand you can think of (and some you don't know), exist in at least one of the two downtowns Chicago offers. Having experience with Marriott and their excellent location on Michigan Avenue, we decided to try this hotel for location and views. Physically the hotel did not dissapoint, but the service could be improved. When reservations are made on Marriott's website, Marriott sends you and email a few days before called the \"Virtual Concierge\" which is a way for you to alert the hotel of any special needs you may have (allergic to feather pillows, need a roll-in shower, etc.) and you have a space in which to type up a question or request of your own. I wrote that it was our anniversary and I wanted to surprise my wife with something along the lines of chocolate covered strawberries and wine, etc., and I wanted to know their pricing and what they offered. I never heard back and just assumed that my message did not go through, or that they wouldn't read it until the day I arrived. I figured I could let the concierge know later during my stay. We arrived at the hotel early and since they only published they had valet service for 39 bucks a day, I did not plan on using my car to go anywhere, so I just had valet park it and paid for it. However, there was a sign that said that there was self parking for $26 a day. Again, we were on a budget and it would have been nice to know about that in advance. The carport can only fit about four cars at a time, in a single line, under it, so if you valet parked, you may wait a while for your car. If you self park, you may be able to get to the garage and get out quicker. We were not expecting to be able to check in so early (1pm) to the hotel. The had a long line of people waiting to check out, even though they had brand new check-out kiosks waiting. While waiting, it gave me time to check out their newly completed renovations. The lobby is fabulous! There a lot of tables and chairs around the lobby that surround their brand new 360-degree bar. The bar, from talking to other people, used to be against the far wall, but now is smack dab in the middle. It is gorgeous with a granite bar all the way around it and very fanciful decor. Next the the desk is a little convenience shop with very upscale drinks and snacks, and, on the other side, a small Starbucks Coffee shop. The lobby was always full of people hanging out, getting drinks and generally socializing. The Concierge desk, near the entrance, was busy making reservations, handing out directions and giving out information about the hotel and area. They had convenient mapcards that they handed you with turn by turn directions for both walking and driving. The elevators were fast, contrary to what I've read on other reviews, and there were always six elevators available. I think I rode on everyone. The elevators are very clean and shiny and have ads and a LCD info TV in them (no sound.) Much to our surprise, management must have read our info because they gave us a corner room on the second to top floor with a breathtaking view of the northern downtown skyline, incuding the Hancock Building. The hallways and room are small showing that this is an older hotel with a facelift, but the real telling factor is the water closet. I call it that because it hardly qualifies as a room to be called a bathroom. You have to close the door to get in the tub! However, they did decorate the space very nicely. There is adequate counter space on the granite vanity and nice amenities as well. The room came with a mini-fridge (always gets the room extra points from me) and we requested and received a microwave. There was an adequate desk with internet connection, lamp and stationary on the far wall. The TV was in a TV cabinet with drawers underneath for storage. There was a sliding glass door, a railing but no balcony, which meant that you could only crack the door due to the safety feature installed on the door. There was a wonderful sitting bench in front of the sliding doors so you could enjoy the views. (Pics to be attached.) We went out and my wife surprised the chocalate lover in me by taking me to the Hershey's store and the Ghiradelli Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (both across the street from each other). We enjoyed many treats! After getting a few souveniers, we headed back to the room for some rest and to get ready for dinner. Much to both of our surprise, room service had stopped by and dropped off an amenity of chocolate covered strawberries, white wine, and various cheeses and crackers. It worked out for me because I could play it off like I had had it planned, however, since I never knew if I was paying for it or not, or what the price even was, I was a little irked. However, it did make my wife's day, even if it was a day earlier than our actual anniversary! I went to get a safety deposit box and stood in line for a very long time to get it, and subsequently to get in and out of it due to the long lines. After a while though (and especially on Sunday) I started to wonder why they had two or three agents for a sold out hotel, but eight stations available. Deborah at the front desk was fabulous, though. She was attentive, caring and very bright - one of those employees you wish everyone was modeled like. There was another older lady who was clueless. I remember a guest asked her to check into a king room and she had to ask a supervisor (Deborah) which room to check him into. (Huh?) Either she never had any training, or she just wasn't qualified to do this job. Also, many people were taken out of turn at the front desk so it made some people a little upset. Their gift shop patrons also waited a while to pay when the desk was busy. Sometimes they just left their money and left. Others just put their selections back and would opt for the cheaper Walgreens locations along Michigan Avenue. There is an entrance to the hotel on Michigan, but only a walk-up entrance. The drive up entrance is on the opposite street. The Marriott building itself has several stores in it, but no access to them from inside the hotel, only from the outside sidewalks. Across the street is a fabulous restaurant called Bandera, that the concierge was able to get us squeezed into on Saturday. Atmosphere was unbeatable. I scarfed down the BBQ Salmon with Cilantro Rice - Divine!!!! Live music from some old jazz buddies, and attentive service! Just what we were looking for Valet service was super duper slow! We waited about 30 minutes for our car, and even since it was raining and the carport was so small taxi's, and other vehicles that were not allowed in the carport were coming in anyway because of the rain so their customers did not get wet. Before anyone could leave, you were waiting on the car in front to move. And since traffic was backed up on the street, it was gridlock on Sunday midday! In conclusion, I don't think the staff hate their jobs, I think they are a little jaded from all the complaints they received before and during the renovations. I also think that they are frustrated in trying to work three people's worth of work in one shift, so why should they work hard every single day when obviously ownership of this property is only concerned with his bottom line and not the guest's experience. I can see why there are some negative reviews, but some of them I think are grossly exaggerated. I think that if you stay here you shouldn't expect great service, but just know that you are in prime location and can get a great view!

The location is excellent, just on the south end of the shopping Mile, an easy 4 blocks from Navy Pier and a brisk 30 minute walk from the Museum Campus (Field, Shedd Aquarium, Planetarium). Our overall experience was good and we would stay there again. For details, read on. I am afraid of heights, so I called the hotel directly about 3 weeks prior to our stay to request a room on a lower floor, 14 or lower. I was told that there was no problem with this request and was relieved. However, when we arrived at the hotel they had no record of this request and were handing us a key to our room on the 33rd floor. I had a minor fit and told them that I would just sleep in the lobby if they couldn't do better. The poor young man at the desk then offered 21st floor. I felt like I was bargaining for a trinket in Puerto Rico. Still not low enough. I kept repeating the mantra \"but I called ahead...\" but nobody seemed impressed. The manager came and fussed with computers a bit, told me that lots of people call with REQUESTS, but they're just REQUESTS and not guarantees. Because we were booked into this hotel and paid for by the convention, I was stuck and scared. The manager finally found us a room on the 10th floor (which, incidentally, is the lowest floor on which guest rooms exist, as everything lower is public areas). He told me they were giving that room to us instead of to the wheelchair-bound woman who had asked for it, something to do with adjoining rooms. So I got the room but also got to feel guilty about inconveniencing the handicapped (didn't occur to me until later, but why does a wheelchair lady need that floor? It's not like someone has to carry her chair up stairs, they have elevators....). Since I am handicapped by my stupid fear of high elevators, I thanked them for the room and wondered why they felt the guilt trip was necessary. So if you're reading this review, wheelchair lady, sorry to have put you out, honestly I am. The room was fine, typical hotel. King size bed, iron, board, hairdryer, shower/tub, toiletries. We overlooked the little sun deck. It was quiet and clean, which is all I really care about. The workout rooms were great, pool is small but indoors and warm, hot tub was nice. Meeting rooms were fine for the convention, though elevators were slow at peak times and shut down for a brief time one afternoon (that helps my elevator fear immensely). Overall the hotel was quite nice and if we find ourselves in Chicago again and can get a decent deal on this place, we'll stay there again.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cRenovated-review\u201d", "Author": "cwcharacters", "ReviewID": "UR17038368", "Content": "One of my favorite spots in Chicago is the recently renovated Marriott Chicago on Michigan Avenue. However, I hadn't stayed since the renovation began and was eagerly anticipating this trip to see how it all turned out.

Gone are the 2nd floor shops, replaced by a grand staircase leading to \"The Restaurant.\" The bar area is draped in neon and the seating is now more than ample. I will say that it all seems a bit much for me. Not as \"hotel-like\" as before, with a certain air of pretention. However, I'm still at ease in this hotel and I am glad that I can still fell like this after such a big change. The rooms are unchanged. Small and cosy, with upscale bedding. The bathrooms are also small, but clean. I found the public areas overly air conditioned, but my room was nice and toasty. I love the Marriott's total nonsmoking policy. My room and everywhere else in the hotel was pleasantly without that stale smoky smell. \"The Restaurant\" was better than average. They only lacked in the bread department, with rolls that were obviously packaged. The lake trout was wonderful, as was the homemade mango sorbet.

(Not bad!) I wanted to write this review because I had a really good experience. I booked this hotel, and then saw a mixed bag of reviews, several negative. It made me a little concerned, but I got there and had a very good time! The Quick Version for the Attention-Span Impaired: Very clean. Tastefully renovated. Slightly above basic comforts. Friendly staff. Awesome location. The Long Version: Location: Excellent! At the south end of the Mag Mile, about a block & a half north of the Wrigley Building. Great for shopping & dining. Cab from Union Station around $7, or the 151 bus for $2. Lobby: The bar takes up a good portion of the lobby. It's kind of cool-looking, with lots of seating. I did not patronize the bar, so can't review it. There is also a Starbucks, which I did frequent and it was good. Check In: They had a lot of people working the front desk, so the wait was short. Although I had used Priceline, (and gotten a killer rate) I was not treated like a second rate or cheapo customer. I got a guy named Terrell or Terrence (can't remember) who seems to enjoy his job. He had a great smile and hooked me up with a nice lake-view room at my request. And, I was able to get right into my room - at noon, on a Friday, in the middle of tourist season, no less! My friend was coming in on another train and they added her name to the reservation, in case she got there while I was out shopping. Again, no hassle and happy to help. My front desk experience made me happy right off the bat, and from that moment, I expected the rest of my stay to be great. (And it was.) Elevators: There are separate ones for lower & upper floors. Most of the time, the wait isn't anything significant. The only time I felt the wait was long-ish was Sunday morning, when you could see a lot of people were checking out. Even then, it wasn't ridiculous. The Room, #3522: Was clean and pleasantly decorated. Air conditioning worked good. We had a lake-view and could see the sailboats on the water, as well as a view of the Tribune Tower. My friend and I both raved about the beds & pillows - so snuggly! We both slept like rocks. TV didn't have a lot of exciting options, but we didn't watch much other than the Weather Channel. (Who comes to Chicago to watch TV? Or hang out in their room for that matter...?) Was the room large? No. But it was not tiny, either. It was just fine for two people. It could probably could be a little tight for 4 people. Bathroom: Again, clean, tasteful, simple. Fine for two people, four would be tight. Nice hot water, water pressure a touch on the weak side, but not enough that I would complain. Bath & Body Works goodies - nice! Only complaint - wish it had a vent fan, in case anyone leaves the restroom smelling not so great. However, I think there is a fan when the shower runs, because it never fogged up in there, and there's a grate above the shower head. Hallway / Walls: Never heard much noise. Staff: Bellhop Michael \"from Baltimore\" was a hoot. Concierges pretty nice, had good info. Front desk were all nice. Housekeeping efficient and quiet. Cannot comment on: Bar, Restaurant, Gym, Pool, Internet. Didn't use 'em. So what's with all the complaints? People complaining about valet parking, small hotel rooms / small bathrooms, slow elevators? Maybe they don't have a lot of experience traveling in big cities like Chicago or New York, where square footage costs money. Also, if you've ever been to a big Vegas hotel or a large convention, you understand how elevators work. This ain't NASA, and it does take a couple of minutes to make its way down from the 44th floor.

Without going into too much detail, the rooms were not of a very good quality, small, cramped bathroom and you had to leave the door open if you took a shower, (no vents).

The carpeting in the king room was wet, but I wasn't about to change the room again or hotels either at this point.

I have stayed at just about every other Marriott property in Downtown Chicago over the past few years, and have always looked forward to the chance to stay at this hotel because it is the flagship Marriott in Chicago. I was delighted by several aspects of my stay, but really disappointed by others. First, the good points: The room, which I booked on the hotel website, was only $159 a night. It had recently had a \"soft\" renovation, meaning new carpets, furniture, wallcoverings and bedding. The hotel's lower levels were under renovation, and the areas which had been redone (all the meeting rooms, the restaurant, and the concierge lounge) were really nice. The lobby, which was still torn up, looked like it will eventually be great based on the renderings. Now, the bad: The rooms really needed a more thorough renovation. The bathroom was very tired, and had been redone on the cheap like one of those home improvement shows where they have only $1000 to spend. The tub, tile, and ceilings were old and shabby. The room was really, really small for a Marriott. The hallways are dark and shabby, and according to an employee I know who works at the hotel, are not due to be renovated. They need it badly. The concierge lounge, even with the hotel at full capacity due to a large trade show, is closed on weekends, and due to the renovations, there are few other options on-site for gathering places with colleagues. The elevators were really slow. I think the basic problem here, like a lot of large city hotels, is that the building is about 30 years old, has gotten a lot of traffic over the years, and needs a major renovation moreso than cosmetic improvements.. Overall, I think Marriott really has failed with this property. Considering that Chicago is one of the nation's great hotel cities, they have come up short here in an area where there are many terrific competitors.

I expect Marriots (Hiltons, Hyatts, Wyndhams, etc.) to be 3-star or 3-1/2 star hotels, with a nice, but rather small room, not too small that I would feel claustrophobic, but not like I feel \"wow this room is huge\". However, the room was definately much bigger than expected, especially for being in downtown chicago. I remember staying at the Regal Knickerbocker Hotel (now the Millineum Knickerbocker) and rembered a luxurious looking room that looked way smaller than the average Marriott. Basically the room is just what they say it is on the website, I noticed a large flat screen tv, not alot of channels for the chicago area, but they at least had the basic ones. Comfortable beds, and still area to sit and lounge. Our bellman Jorge, was great, and went out of our way to help us. The check-in was quick, and thats all for service, granted, I do not remember a problem. I did not eat at the hotel or go to the pool, or remember using any other amenities. The location is better than I ever imagined, with a mall next door, and plenty of shopping, and a ton of great restaurants, in less than walking distance. I am from St. Louis, and it was hard to imagine such a great downtown area, with so much to do and so many great places to eat. Many attractions are at Navy Pier and Grant Park which is a bit far, but if you spend the day there, it is best, because you can eat at some of the world's best restaraunts just a few blocks or less away. The other side of the Chicago River, where Grant Park and the Sears Tower is, does not have all the great restaurants, so it may be cheaper.

This just annoyed me because it is a huge thing to mess up, especially for guests who are paying for a premium room and staying for two weeks.

Behind the coffeemaker, on a shelf below the desk, I found a previous guest's pill bottle that it looked like she'd stored some kind of brown powdery stuff in (coffee? cocoa? tea? hmmm...). I left it there a couple of days and finally threw it out myself. The one coffee mug I used the first day was never replaced during our 6 night stay, nor were the teabags. This part of the room was basically untouched and invisible to the housekeeper. The lobby bar is very nice and open, and a great meeting place. Conveniently, they serve a light menu which was great for us folks arriving late. I'd stay here again if someone else was paying, just because it's a great location, and I'd definitely get a room w-a-y down the hall from the elevators!", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WI", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Nice Location\u201d", "Author": "cindyrella25", "ReviewID": "UR10656423", "Content": "Three girlfriends and I stayed here for a girls weekend.

I have never stayed at one that I didn't enjoy. That being said, they are sometimes above my price range. For this trip, I needed to go as cheaply as I could without lowering my standards. While searching, the Marriott website was the first one I looked at. Then I looked at different hotel sites as well as travel sites offering deals. Everything was above my budget. So I tried Priceline. This was my first time using it, and I was so very happy when my third bid was accepted to see that I'd won the Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile! Being a Pricline reservation, there were restrictions. However, it doesn't hurt to try, so the week before our arrival, I emailed the hotel directly to request that the 2 rooms I had reserved be adjoining and that we have 2 beds in each room. Within one day, I had a reply from them saying they would forward my request to the front desk and do everything possible to accomodate us. When we arrived, I mentioned emailing, and the front desk person assured me that they were going to accomodate that request! I was very happy, as we had 5 in our party, and wanted to stay together, if possible. The rooms were beautifully decorated. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever had in a hotel room. Lots of soft, fluffy pillows, down comforters, quality bed linens. Modern, flat screen tv's in each room. Two phones in each room. A desk with chair, and an upholstered chair as well. We also had a full length mirror in each room, which was very nice. The only down side, and this was very minor, was the size of the bathrooms. The toilet and tub were in one very small room, and the sink and closet were outside of that room. Only one person could stand in front of the sink, as there was no room for anyone else. Having 3 women in one room and 2 in the other, this made it a little hard, but we made do just fine. Water pressure in the shower was good, not a fine spray like most hotels. Never had a problem with water temperature either. The staff at this hotel were wonderful. Every time we had a question or request, it was dealt with very courteously and quickly. Check in and out was quick and easy. The only time we ate in one of the hotel restaurants was the morning we left. We grabbed a muffin and coffee on our way out, where the service was quick and the prices were decent. We tried out the pool and the hot tub the last evening, and that was a big hit, as we were all pretty tired from all the walking we did while shopping. The exercise room looked very nice, although we didn't have an opportunity to use it. Location of this hotel was great for our needs. Close enough to walk to the Loop for the theater, and right on the Mag Mile, close to shopping and restaurants. We caught the bus right across the street for the northern end of Michigan Ave, and for going to the zoo.

Unbelieveably comfortable king-size bed and linens. As Marriott rewards customers, we have stayed in many many Marriotts, as well as many many other hotels over the years, and I'd venture to say this was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, including my own at home. Small dresser and desk, loveseat, two nightstands. The room's biggest \"issue\" is the size of the bathroom. I've only ever seen one smaller hotel bathroom in my life. This one was shockingly small. It was functional for one person -- it had a nice-size vanity, and it did have a good shower -- but the size made it impossible for two people to get ready at the same time.

I had spoken with Marriott directly and asked if this were the hotel next to Nordstrom on MI Ave, to avoid any confusion. They said yes, but apparently I had reserved with an outlying hotel. This one is IMMEDIATELY next to Nordstrom. The man at the front desk let me stay but told me \"only this time\" and then continued to lecture me.

The basketball court on the roof, which is advertised on the website, is no longer available - a disappointment to my children. They generally have only ONE elevator in service. The internet costs too much and works only sporadically. I paid for parking but the parking folks were not aware of it. The gift shop is not where it is supposed to be, never found it. The salon has moved. Nothing is where it is advertised in the hotel guide and half of the services are \"out of service at this time\". Almost nothing is as advertised or where/when it's supposed to be. Small rooms, but it is fine for a place to sleep in a good location.

A nice feature was the full length mirror, which I don't see in a lot of hotels. Bathroom has nice tile floors and marble countertops. The room was larger than I was expecting for a single -- maybe I'm used to the hotel rooms in New York and London, but this felt like a ballroom compared to most hotel rooms I've been staying in recently. All of the staff were fantastic; very polite, very responsive, and very knowledgeable (with the exception of one Concierge, who didn't really seem to care about helping me, despite the fact that I was the only person at his desk -- the other 4 Concierges I spoke to, though, were great).

This may only matter to people who like to stay in very modern and design-chic places, but I doubt those type of people will be staying at the Marriott anyway.

We stayed at the Marriott Chicago/Magnificent Mile. It was a 3 day, 2 night trip: Rooms: I have done a bunch of travel in the last couple of years and have stayed at many different types of hotels/resorts and different chains. At this Marriott, I thought that the beds in the rooms were some of the most comfortable that I have ever slept on. The pillows were extremely comfortable as well as the bed itself and the light featherbed that was on it. I have been told my other people that all Marriott beds are like this, but all I know is that the beds at this Marriott were extremely comfortable. The rooms contained an ironing board, Iron, Bath and Body Works Shampoo and Conditioner, plenty of towels, with a flat screen TV, small table and chairs, and high speed internet (available for a small fee). The room itself was not extremely big but had a decent view of the city. (I heard some rooms, the view is not so good!) The carpets and bathroom was clean which is always nice. The hallways were also quiet at night which was a plus. Lobby: We stayed at this Marriott over the weekend and the lobby and lobby bar were extremely busy. The lobby is an open space with lots of tables and couches for you to sit on, relax, and have a cocktail before heading out to the city for the night. The prices were reasonable for service at the bar. It was a very nice lobby experience. Also in the lobby was the bell desk, front desk, and the concierge which was very helpful in finding nearby restaurants and bars. Location: This hotel I believe is in a great location. It is right on Michigan Avenue in the heart of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loop.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I hope that is what the immediate downtown is called.) It is very close to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Rush St. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and all of the hotspots of downtown. There is great shopping close as well as many great restaurants within walking distance. At the hotel, we valet parked our car with the hotel and never once removed it from the garage as we could walk anywhere we wanted to go or just take a short cab ride. Service: Check in was extremely quick. All we needed to do was give our last name and our reservation was pulled up. The staff was quick to have our bags brought upstairs and tell us where all of the amenities of the hotel were such as gift/sundry shop, pool, coffee bar, lobby bar etc.. The concierge located in the lobby was very helpful with making reservations and providing lists of nearby restaurants broken down by type of food and location. Finally, the valet and bellmen at the front entrance were very quick to hail us a cab, or to help us go in any direction that we needed. Pool: There is a pool located on the 9th floor (I think) but we did see or go in it. Overall, Our stay at the Marriott was great and provided a great \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home base\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to go and do whatever we wanted to do that night in Chicago .

From O'Hare take the blue-line to Jackson and transfer via an underground tunnel (free transfer) to the red-line; then it's a couple stops to Grand. You could also get off the blue-line at the blue-line Grand Station and take the 65 bus toward navy pier. It stops at Rush and Illinois. So, it's a short one block walk. Best thing is it costs less than $2, what a deal!

I was at the hotel for a conference. I would leave the room temp set at 60 every morning and when I would come back it would be HOT. 72 degrees with heat coming out the vent. I called down to the front desk and they told me that all the room are climate controlled at 72 degrees that means that even if you set the temp higher or lower, it won't work.....72 degrees! Why sets at room at 72?!?!?!...72 degrees is HOT and stuffy. The room was stuffy and although the bed was great it was very hot when I was sleeping. I couldn't even set the thermostat for the air or vent to circulate because only hot air came out. I met many other people staying at the hotel who had the same problem.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d87592-Reviews-Marriott_Chicago_Downtown_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html", "Price": "$220 - $453*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">540 N Michigan Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Chicago</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">60611</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87592", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/3f/c7/our-lobby-has-been-transformed.jpg"}}

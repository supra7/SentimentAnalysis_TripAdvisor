Some good points - the service was good and the pool/fitness center excellent.

The hall is spare, and smelled a lot like fresh paint when we were there. The room was the best part- very large with a vaulted ceiling and a fireplace. The bathroom was ok---nothing to write home about, but serviceable. It had a skylight, which is nice. There was a refrigerator-mini bar. There is a very small balcony overlooking another nearby building and a courtyard, and beyond you can see cars on the highway constantly and trains going by occasionally about 150 ft away The room cleaners had a lot of used towels and other materials in the hallway--I expect a neater cart than that. The TV was ok, but on the small side, and not flat screen. Another good thing was the free breakfast. This was acutally pretty good, with cereal, pastries, fruit, coffee, and orange juice.

Clean and very well decorated rooms with fireplaces andcomfortable beds. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. Not cheap, but much, much nicer then similar hotels such as Villagio and The Vintage Inn. The combination of quality and location is hard to beat. Located within walking distance of the shops and restaurants of St Helena and in close proximity to many of the major wineries. The rooms are very pleasant and well appointed and a very nice if simple continental breakfast is served daily. The pool and spa are great. No significant negatives with the possible exception of some road noise if you stay in the rooms on the west end of the hotel or over the attached restaurant. Overall a real find in the Napa Valley.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highlands Ranch, CO", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3484649", "Content": "We did not have advance reservations, but found the suite very nice and the location excellent for the local restaurants and wineries.

I have to admit though, I was a bit nervous staying somewhere that had no reviews written about it... but I went ahead and booked it anyway. You would never know that this hotel even exists because it is doesn't really look like a hotel. It is quite small and is hidden (behind tons of beautiful Wisteria) even though it is just off the main street in St. Helena. We found the staff to be very friendly. The room was generous in size, nicely decorated, had a fireplace, comfortable bedding and bed. We chose a room facing the parking lot, which was slightly less expensive, but it didn't really matter in the end. The other side of the hotel looks out into a sort of courtyard/restaurant area. There was a tiny balcony looking out, but really too small to use. The continental breakfast was fairly typical, and we also dined in the Tra Vigne Pizzeria (attached to the hotel) which was great for us since we travelled with our young daughter. St. Helena was a quaint town and the hotel is in walking distance to restaurants, shopping, wine tasting, etc. I did go to the health spa (which is literally opposite the front door), which was quite small and nothing to rave about. Also, my locker had a problem and I had to go get someone to open it which was annoying, but it was nice to have the option to use their basic facilities that were included in our room rate. Our room package also came with a bottle of wine. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here. It was our first time to the Napa Valley so I can't compare it to anywhere else there, but for a convenient location, smaller and a less tourist-y choice, the Inn at Southbridge would be a great place to stay.", "Date": "May 8, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Southbridge Napa Valley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g33000-d111940-Reviews-Southbridge_Napa_Valley-St_Helena_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$295 - $549*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1020 Main St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">St. Helena</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94574</span></span> (Formerly Inn at Southbridge)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "111940", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fc/52/fc52439d9627123578eee94c3ddf93e46large.jpg"}}

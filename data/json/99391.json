When I arrived the hotel was doing work on one of its two elevators. Bummer. But a well placed sign offered an apology and the front-desk staff were friendly, although a bit uppity. I came in dripping wet and dressed as I always do when traveling -- jeans, running shoes and in this case, a runner's rain jacket. Apparently this wasn't the usual outfit so it took my being a rewards member to get a smile from the clerk. After that it was smooth sailing. The hotel is half a block from the NY Public Library and if you have time in the city, I highly recommend a visit to the main library. The lending branch also is nearby, but if you don't live in NYC, returning a borrowed book could be nightmare. The main library is home to collections that fascinate both young and old, and the lower level reading room for kids is a great place to come in from the cold or rain if you're traveling with children. The Courtyard on 5th has free breakfast like all of the brands. But skip the stiff waffles and stale bagels. Head out of the hotel, make a right and then a quick left onto fifth avenue. Go down two blocks to 38th St and then turn right until sixth avenue. On the corner is a great place for breakfast, offering the perfect NY morning meal of two eggs, two slices of toast, home fries, bacon/sausage and cup of coffee for about $4. You could power your whole day with a meal here, and again if traveling with family, it's a bargain. Of course, more expensive than free, but who wants Fruit Loops anyway? All of the hotels rooms seemed to face the street and the night I stayed there was construction going on. The windows were OK, but the clang and clatter of the overnight work bothered me a bit. If noise bothers you, too, then check to see if there is any construction work going on and maybe get set of ear plugs from the many Duane Reade drug stores that dot the city's streets. The room was clean, and NY-small, but if you want to be near the heart of things - Times Square is just a five minute walk west, and Bryant Park, the home of Fashion Week and a collection of decent retail vendors, is across the street.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new delhi", "Title": "\u201cGood location, average place\u201d", "Author": "apollotraveller", "ReviewID": "UR121506538", "Content": "Very well located.

The rooms are clean and average size, not very big, but decent for NYC. Our room actually had 3 adult people in it. We were there only to sleep and shower, so we weren't in it long enough to feel cramped. The thing I like best about this hotel is the location. It's just 5 mins from Times Square, but far enough away that you are not smack in the middle of the crowds. Times Square is completely full of people at night so hard to get around. Union Station subway is also 2-3 blocks away from the hotel. Bryant Park is just a block down the road. My family also walked to Rockefeller Center and the shopping areas on 5th Avenue. We only took a taxi or subway when we went to SoHo and beyond. If you want to have a good fresh breakfast or lunch, there's also a great deli (Charlie's) just next door to the hotel, which serves fresh-made sandwiches, salad bar, hot food bar, small groceries, fresh fruit, just about anything you need, but in a small market environment (very quaint for being in NYC). It was very convenient after several fancy dinners, which I couldn't afford to do every night. I also don't like to eat too much fast food, so dropping by Charlie's next door was great (affordable, fresh, and healthy). I never ended up eating at the hotel at all, so can't tell you how the hotel food is. I didn't use the gym, but I did stop by to check it out. The gym is very small, but it has newer looking equipment - treadmill, bike, the basic stuff. There's no pool. The front staff is also very friendly and helpful. I didn't request early check in, but we arrived really early and they gave me my room after just 15mins of wait time. They offered to upgrade one of the two rooms we booked for free. The front desk also gave us suggestions on nice restaurants to eat at. This hotel can be pretty pricey in peak season. I went in Aug. If you can get a good deal, then the location is definitely worth it. I've stayed at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square previously, which is a more upscale hotel, but even more pricey. If you're in NYC, then you're going to be roaming the city alot and not in your room. So for that reason alone I would pick this hotel based on location.

You know how some hotel rooms you just love to come back to at the end of the day, either because they're so attractive or cheerful or comfortable or possibly have wonderful things you don't have at home? Well, that's not this hotel. First of all, it's old but not in the historic sense, just as in it's seen better days. I reserved a king room but upon check in it wasn't ready so I was told a room with two doubles was the same size. I took it but feel incredibily cramped at under 200 sq feet. I just saw something online that said the kings are larger so misinformation somewhere but I wish I'd held out for what I'd reserved. I'm just here for another night and it certainly isn't worth changing rooms. The bathroom is clean but very basic with limited counter space if you have toiletries. The towels were clean as well but so thin they reminded me of the feel of dish towels. My room is in the back and I get almost no outside noise, which is great, but I also get no natural light. My window looks directly into the windows of the office building across from it and even had it been a sunny day, it would have made little difference. The lighting in the room is, in my opinion, too limited for working. I couldn't wait to leave for work in the morning and to go outside in the evening because it's more claustraphobic in here than relaxing. The building is tall but each floor is small with about 7 rooms so there isn't much traffic passing by and that helps it stay quiet. For some unknown reason, there is an overhead vent in the bathroom that's always running with no \"off\" switch but closing the door at night is enough so that is won't boether your sleep. The bottom line is that if this is more affordable than other options, there are no obvious reasons not to stay if you just want basic accommodations while you explore the city but if you are on a business trip there are probably better alternatives. Additionally, if you are traveling with kids or more than one person, this would just be too crowded. The restaurant in the hotel is okay in terms of food and price, but with very poor service.

The hotel has a bank of 3 computers on the mezzanine level with internet access and a printer to use if you need it. We brought our own laptop and enjoyed uninterrupted internet access in our room. They also offered a very nice selection of cable programming including HBO, which was nice. The beds were super comfortable. We both slept through the entire night and woke up refreshed. There is also free 24/7 coffee on the mezzanine level. Housekeeping straightened up our room every day and did a very nice job.

It is in the best possible location, too - close to Bryant Park and within a few blocks of Broadway, Grand Central Station and Times Square. There is even a library across the street which I didn't get a chance to visit, but plan to on our next trip. There are all kinds of little stores and restaurants nearby as well. A little tip for economical travel - there is a large .99 cent store across the street with pretty much everything you need with the exception of fresh produce. If you want to save on breakfast, you might consider picking up a package of bagels and stop in for yogurt, which was very tasty. There are all kinds of snacks there - nuts, candy, whatever you like. We bought fresh fruit from a little street vendor and his prices were very good. McDonald's is less than a block away and we were pleased to discover their prices were not too much out of line with what we were accustomed to paying locally. A salad that I normally pay $4.79 was $5.49 there and the ice cream cones were $1.00. We don't eat a lot of McDonald's but it was a welcome sight for a quick meal.

The immediate surroundings of the hotel is quite quiet though in terms of restaurants and bars. There's a small place at the base of the hotel itself - which I didn't sample - and the concierge recommended a friendly diner on Lexington for breakfast which was good. I think it was called Blooms and again was a five minute walk away. There is a coffee machine in the lobby, and there are a couple of delis and \"seven eleven\" style stores nearby for light snacks if necessary. Generally though, we were out of the hotel and into the subway to somewhere else while we stayed here. Next time I visit Manhatten I think I'd try a livlier area, Greenwhich Village or the East Side, to stay. This place, although dead centre of the city, is surprisingly dead itself.

The location was wonderful as it is only a couple of blocks from Times Square and within walking distance to many subway stations including Grand Central station. What sucked was the size of the rooms and the hallways. I've stayed in Courtyard Marriotts before as I am a rewards member and the rooms are normally smaller than than other Marriott brands but not THIS small. It was four to each room and we could barely move around. The distance between the beds and the TV was approximately 23 inches. NO JOKE. Also, the hallway area around the elevator and the hallways in general were very narrow. And the ice/snack machines were only on the 4th, 15th, and 25th floors of this 30 floor hotel. ???????? I would have given cleanliness five stars but there were a few spots in the bathroom that did not appear to be mopped. We covered this area with a towel so we wouldn't walk over it. The bathroom was extremely small, too. Only one person can be in the bathroom comfortably at one time unless one person was in the shower. On the bright side, the second room did not appear to be as small but it was smaller than normal. Also beware as this hotel has NO POOL. There are three computers in the hotel with free internet access which is a life saver for having teenagers with us. Unless you are going alone or with your spouse/partner (the king bed rooms probably have a LITTLE more room) I would NOT recommend this hotel. I only booked it because it was the cheapest we could get near the Times Square area at $139 per night. Most rooms in that area are far above that. Next time we'll prepare to pay a little more for comfort. We stayed at the Holiday Inn on 57th in Midtown Manhattan a couple of years ago and it was very nice. Not only did it have a pool the rooms were large, clean, and very comfortable. That room was $216 per night and we would have booked it this trip but none of the other adults in the group wanted to pay over one hundred something per night. They complained about the Courtyard throughout the whole stay so I'm sure they have learned their lesson. I made an unwise decision to have breakfast in the hotel ONE day throughout the 4-day trip. I paid $17.15 including a gratuity and the buffet only included what appeared to be powdered scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, cereals, milk, and a waffle station. The waffle was the best part of the breakfast. There appeared to be a watery substance in the egg pan so I didn't try that. I don't care for potatoes and can't really eat bacon right now so I had the sausage. It looked good but it was the most DISGUSTING sausage I've ever tasted in my life. And they DIDN'T have grapefruit juice. Do yourself a favor and have breakfast at the McDonald's across the street, find a restaurant in the Times Square area, or hop on the D train to the IHOP on 135th and Adam Clayton Powell in Harlem. For those of you who are sneezing at Harlem it is quite safe there. There are many nice shopping places on 125th and not to mention, the Apollo is on this street as well. We were actually there to witness a lot of the tributes to Michael Jackson that were taking place in front of the Apollo and all around Times Square.

Our room was very cold, because the heater fan was malfunctioned (I found out about it from a technician on the last day our stay-we stayed 4 nights). Although a check-in clerk promised me that he would talk to the manager to lower my rate, they still charged me $199 for the third night and $159 (airline industry rate) for the fourth night. I used points for the first two nights. After checking out, I noticed that they had lowered the rate but a check-out clerk didn't even double check to see if I got my request granted. I guess that he had a \"typical\" male attitude towards a minority woman like me. Only good experience was a bell man who had a pleasant smile and serving attitude, and a female clerk who was willing to exchange my bills to quarters for bus ride. She was cute.

And, because the rooms are so tiny, the neighbors are in close proximity, and you can hear each door open and close; every sneeze; every toilet flush, etc. DO NOT accept a room on 16 or 25 as those floors have noisy ice machines in the hallways - yes, in the hallway, not in a closet with a door as you would find in most other hotels. Beware, too, of any rooms on the non-street side of lower floors as they are claustrophobic - the windows offer views of brick walls of the tall neighboring structures.

The rooms were smaller than they generally are throughout the country, but for NYC, they were of a good size. My mother and I had plenty of room, including room to store our luggage. My other family members were a bit cramped, but there are four of them and they tend to be a bit chaotic anyway. The beds were VERY comfortable, especially after a long day of walking! There was also high-speed internet in the rooms (in addition to two computers and printers in the mezzanine, which was great -- so that you can print off your boarding passes). The bathroom was of a good size (pretty standard for anywhere), and the soap, shampoo, etc. provided was of good quality. Housekeeping was great as well!

There were eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit (it was good!), waffles, croissants, bagels, cereal, a selection of juices, milk and other beverages (I may be missing something, but can't put my finger on it). The better place to eat was Cafe Charlie's which was on the other side. It was twenty-four hours and is a cross between a convenience store, a grocery store and a restaurant. There was food that you could take of a shelf and purchase, a salad bar set-up with many different options, including fresh fruit (delicious and perfect!), and a grill area where things were made-to-order, including bagels, french toast, pancakes, etc. The only meal we ate there was breakfast, and it was great.

It's in a great location off Fifth Avenue and 40th Street. I was shocked at how small this hotel is in comparison to other Courtyards/hotels I have stayed at in Manhattan and other large cities. I am actually a New Yorker so I am very familiar with Manhattan and this hotel was located very close to where I had an early business meeting so I thought I would spend the night rather than having to take a very early train in from the suburbs. I checked in about 9PM and the room had a queen size bed, a credenza with a flat screen TV, two night tables and a small bathroom (usually considered the size of a \"half bath\"). This was the entire room for $419 per nite (including all taxes). It was a good thing I only needed to sleep here and check out since there was no chair (other than the desk chair) to even sit on and you bumped into the bed each time you tried to move around the room!

I moved in here a week ago after a bad experience at a Ramada a few blocks southwest of this place. I LOVE it here. The beds, first of all, are the most comfy beds EVER. I also love having full control of the AC/heater (don't assume that all NYC hotels do this, I learned the hard way). It's always as hot or cold as I like it. The free internet access is great... I'd rather it be wireless, but if I had to choose between wired or sketchy wireless, I'd choose wired, so it's fine with me. The hotel staff is soooo friendly and accomodating. Everyone greets you with a smile and helps when you need something. The hotel itself is very clean and updated. I know the curb appeal isn't great with all of the scaffolding, but just look beyond that and walk into your own little home in the city. My only minor complaint is that room service is too expensive and doesn't really have a great variety of food. I know most people eat out when they're in NYC, but I'm stuck here for two weeks on business and sometimes I just want what's easy. Plus, being in midtown, there aren't tons of places right next door to eat (especially on the weekends). But walk a few blocks in any direction, and I guarantee you'll find something to suit your fancy. Oh, and Ray's Original Famous Pizza does deliver here, and it's WONDERFUL. The front desk was kind enough to give me menus of a few places. :) There's tons of shopping six blocks south and one block west, near Macy's... it's easy to walk there and back. And Times Square is an easy walk, too... The Empire State Building is very close, as well, as is Grand Central Terminal, which will take you anywhere you want to go.

If the hotel was ever crowded, I could only imagine that people would have to wait outside until they got to the \"front desk\" in the lobby. The \"front desk\" consisted of a folding table with a tablecloth and two folding chairs. It looked very unprofessional. I understand that the lobby is being made over, but it still looked very uninviting and cheap. Additionally, since the people were seated, you had to \"talk down to them.\" It was very awkward. The location of the hotel was better than I thought. Very central, very close (about two blocks) to a number of subway lines, about a block from Bryant Park and Grand Central Station. Also, having Charlie's Cafe next door was convenient for any snacks and drinks. The elevators ran pretty well and we didn't have to wait long to use them as opposed to some other Marriotts in NYC. The room and bathroom were a decent size for NYC standards, but I think they may have put us in a disabled room so that could have made it a little larger. The decor was modern. I had a couple of beefs - one was that the pillows were virtually nonexistent and the comforter was extremely thin. The bed was also kind of hard. However, after we called the front desk to bring more pillows and blankets, they were brought up within minutes. Also, there were only two fairly small bath sized towels and they felt very cheap, thin, and itchy. A full slate of the normal toiletries were missing (i.e., hair conditioner). The shower was okay, but the shower head was not the greatest in comparison to other hotels that have much stronger water pressure. Checkout was easy, but we had one major problem. We had heavy bags and no one from the hotel offered to call us a cab as is regularly done at virtually all other hotels. Additionally, not too many cabs came down 40th street where the hotel was located. When the bellboy saw us waiting for a cab, he only told us where we should head to get one. What happened was that we had to drag the bags for about 4 blocks without any success in getting a cab until we came to the Marriott Residence Inn. There, two Marriott limo drivers helped us to get a cab. We were very frustrated and disappointed in the lack of service in this area at the Courtyard. All in all, the reason why we stayed at this hotel was because we got an unbelievable deal.

We checked in as a split group; my wife and in-laws came earlier than I did, and the desk clerk was understanding and, while only one of the two rooms was ready at that point, he was able to accommodate them. They arranged for the key to the other room, and a parking pass, to be simply waiting for me when I arrived a few hours later. We also got lucky in that there was a cancellation that allowed us to upgrade our rooms to the ocean-side balconies in the main building. This hotel is comprised of more than one building, with the second building being set closer to the street than the boardwalk. The walk between the two buildings is maybe about 50 feet, so we're not talking about a huge hike, here. This second building also houses the indoor pool, which is a near-twin to the outdoor pool. Both pools have handicap access via a hydraulic chair lift (it doesn't currently appear in the photos on the hotel's website, so this must be a recent addition). Our room--as noted above--was an upgrade to an ocean-side room, which is a nice size and has a balcony overlooking the ocean. Because the main building is next to the Kite Loft, we had the bonus view of dozens of kites which they have anchored into the beach itself. Our room had two double beds, a pull-out sofa and a kitchenette that included a microwave, mini-fridge (4 CF unit), coffee maker, toaster, sink (with dishcloths and detergent) and a two-burner stove. (My understanding is that some units don't have the stove.) Also included were utensils and plates/cups/glasses for six people, and cooking vessels. The bathroom was a little on the small side and rather oddly laid out, but up-to-date and fully stocked with the usual amenities. Other stuff in the room included the alarm clock radio, iron and ironing board, and flat screen TV with an impressive assortment of channels. Free wi-fi internet is available; we arrived \"out of season\" (a week after Labor Day) so a password wasn't needed, but you still have to go to a generic OC website first. In-season, you may have to get a password from the desk clerk. I didn't see any data ports in my room so I don't think wired internet is available. Climate control is provided by a through-the-wall A/C unit. Some rooms (my in-laws') have units with digital displays and the \"energy saver\" mode so that the unit cycles on and off; others (mine) had an analog control and the unit remained on constantly. So in that realm, your mileage may vary a little. There's also some space available for you to leave your beach chair, boogie board, etc. without your having to trip over it. There is a safe in the closet that locks with a key rather than the usual electronic code. Personally I'd be more comfortable with the code because it's tougher to lose, but that's a minor complaint. Everyone in the hotel--EVERYONE, including guests and staff--was friendly and chatty, and none of our conversations with the staff felt like just so much empty noise. Most of the guests we encountered were repeat customers. In fact, the couple in the room next to us told me that they visit every year, and arrange to get the same room each year. It was a very familial atmosphere despite our only being there for the weekend. The hotel offers a breakfast that's a small step above the usual Continental breakfast: there are DIY waffle makers on hand, and an assortment of pastries, fruit, and stuff to toast, plus cereal and a hot option. On both days for us it was scrambled eggs and sausage, and other reviews here suggest that this may always be the option. And if you brought something of your own that needed heating, there are also a couple of microwave ovens as well. There isn't a lot of room in the breakfast prep/dining area, and this led to some unfortunately self-entitled behavior on the part of some of the other guests. Because the tables were full, we opted to eat in our room. In good weather there are also a couple of tables immediately outside the breakfast area. A few varieties of coffee are also available; and the coffee is there all day, not just during breakfast time. From a pricing standpoint, it's probably a little more than you'd expect to pay for a Comfort Inn (about $180/night), but it's in the middle range for Ocean City on the boardwalk.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful with great location\u201d", "Author": "Chloebebe", "ReviewID": "UR137949986", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights.

This being said this hotel states that it is Oceanfront and not behind a Hooters restaurant! There is one building on the property that is Oceanfront but the rest of the buildings are scattered all over the place and we happened to be in the one that housed the indoor pool. The smell of Mildew as you entered the property is overwhelming. I just used the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator. The rooms were clean but run down. The A/C unit is a window one so it blows out onto the patio. There is a mini fridge and microwave in the room so you can store a small amount of items. Beware if you move your car and try to get a parking spot you will have to walk a few blocks, if you have just made a grocery store run can be quite the pain because you have to cross the main street to get from parking to the hotel. They offer free breakfast, but the day I went in I couldn't even find a place to sit. They fail to mention that you will be dining with all of the staff from the hotel, and after taking a good look at the cleanliness of the area where the food was put out, we opted to grab a quick bite elsewhere. This hotel is good for a weekend but I would never stay for a week.

We were sad that they didn't have any vacancies for SunFest this year so we had to find a room elsewhere - now we know to book a little earlier!!

The rooms are basic beach hotel rooms - but always clean, which is most important. They have a small fridge, some plates and utensils, a small coffee pot and wi-fi is available.

I called 3 times the week before our visit to make sure we had 7 rooms for 7 families....each time after looking at the computer for lengths of time they finally found all 7 families and each had a room....GREAT! when we checked in early we were happy to have our room ready! There was still some question about a room that didn't have a name to it... i said i squared everything before i go there and we reviewed it one more time...all good. room was clean. indoor pool small but nice. at 11:55 pm! we were alseep , we had a tournament the next day, my husband, i and 4 teenagers were awoken to the phone ringing. Night manager told us that someone had not checked into one room, i said 1 family is coming tomorrow but they had called and he mentioned one of the names... i said nope they are here and checked in, we got off the phone. i got back to sleep and 15 minutes later... OK AFTER MIDNIGHT he calls me back. i said sir, how dare you call my room 2 times at midnight and wake up my entire family ( i was NOT yelling) He yelled.... FINE I AM CHARGING YOUR CARD FOR THE EXTRA ROOM< YOU CAN PICK UP THE KEYS.... and hung up! i went down to the lobby and there was a man at the counter, on the computer. i said excuse me are you the night manager? he said .... after a pause... yes i am. I said well you just hung up on me. i started to go down my list of families and how i had called mulitple times, he wouldn't let me speaka nd proceeded to scream at me and tell me hes tired of dealing with this kind of crap! I tried to say several things but he wasn't allowing me to speak at all...so i finally screamed backa nd said are you going to let me speak?!?!?! He said fine. i told him how i had called several times, how i did my part in ensuring every room had a family and i don't understand the problem. he said i am not going to charge you for the extra room. i said your right, you aren't. another woman who works there had coming in during his yelling at me. she looked mortified! ( apparently the end of that story is that one family had changed the length of their stay and there fore were out of my block of rooms... that however was not explained to me..... until the next day by the day manager, who was much nicer to deal with and appauled that i was called at mid night!) i did call corporate after speaking with the day manager and his recommending i call... the hotel offered me 15% off my next stay at that hotel.... and i find that an unsatisfactory resolution. considering i brought over 3500 dollars to that hotel that weekend! I have written the hotel owner directly and hope that there is a better resolution and an apology. I cannot believe anyone in customer servive would speak to someone this way....especially UNPROVOKED. i did not yell at or raise my voice until i was not allowed to speak for several minutes into this mans tirade. i understand he is recently in management after many years with the company. perhaps this is not the best position for him. We did try the breakfast and my husband and i who aren't too picky couldn't eat the ice cold eggs and undercooked sausage that was cold in the middle. and the line to make waffles was 8 people deep!

Full disclosure, I work in the hotel business, so I am usually very picky about where I stay. I arrived early in the morning, and was greeted by Fred, the front desk agent on duty. I knew that it would be too early to check in, but I inquired about getting a parking permit so that my family and I could park and enjoy the beach. Fred told me that would not be an issue at all, and quickly gave me a parking permit. Darren, the general manager, came out to the desk, warmly greeted me and told me that they would try to get me a room as quickly as possible. I certainly did not expect that since check in is at 3pm. Ten minutes later, Fred handed me our room keys and sent us on our way. The room was beautiful. Large enough for my family of four to be comfortable, with no feeling of being cramped. Not only was the room of a good size, but it included a small stove-top, with pans, as well as silverware, a sink and microwave. The room was very clean, and the housekeeping staff was extremely nice, welcoming and quick to assist in any way. James, our housekeeper, was especially nice. As we were leaving our room on our second day, he asked us if we were leaving and if we would like service. He did not knock on our door at any time, and was very patient with my family. Chris, the night time manager, was also very friendly and I spent almost 30 minutes talking with him on our first night. He was very informative about the area and was quick to answer any questions that we had. I can not say enough glowing things about Darren and Fred.

Once again, it did not disappoint. This time I took some pictures to add. We booked by phone through the hotel front desk, asking for the same rooms on the fourth floor oceanfront that we had in the spring. All except for one room they accommodated us but they kept us together, which was a plus. Right in view of the front desk staff is a television screen with a number of security of cameras of the public/hall areas. I didn't ask about their security measures but it was comforting to know that they had some security there. Maybe next time I'll inquire as to their security measures. There are four or five handicapped parking spots, and as it goes for handicapped parking spots sometimes they are available and sometimes they aren't. We saw a few vehicles parked in those spots without handicapped designation either on license plates or rear-view mirror placards. The parking lot is smoothly paved and pretty much level, with a slight grade towards the entrance, and pretty much navigable with a wheelchair. I put up some pictures of our room, and am trying to concentrate on things I didn't on my last review. The efficiency kitchen in this room is well equipped. There is a two-burner electric stovetop with an overhead vent, a small microwave, efficiency size refrigerator with a decent capacity and very small token freezer, a two-slice toaster, and a four-cup coffee maker. The sink is small but deep. There is service for four; plates, bowls, cups, tumblers, and flatware. Our kitchen was equipped with a medium sized stew pot, a small and a medium size soup pot, and a medium size frying pan, all in good shape and with a nonstick coating. There was a can opener and some cooking utensils, but not a spatula. From what was in our family's other two rooms it seems that the cooking utentils vary, so if you plan to prepare food in your room it might be a good idea to bring a few cooking utensils and a can/bottle opener just in case. There is a small bottle of dishsoap, a dishcloth and dish towel provided, along with a dish drainer. The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, and I can say this because I checked the corners. I was comfortable enough that it was well cleaned. When the air conditioner was on it had a fan that ran constantly, which got annoying. Our room was serviced/maintained by James, who had the same friendly and accomodating demeanor you would expect in a higher end hotel. Usually on our shorter stays, instead of having our room cleaned and beds made we usually just swap out towels, put our room trash out, and request paper products if needed. This was one of those short stays, and we found James cheerful, pleasant, and very accommodating. He remembered us and not only asked if there was anything we needed but knew our other family members there and asked us if we knew if there was anything they needed. Thanks James. Good job! In our room there was a table with two chairs in the seating area. The balcony is too small to have a meal on, and the seagulls seem finely tuned to anything edible so I think eating on the balcony may not be a good idea. Our room had a flat screen television, about 33\", with a remote control. There was also a clock radio. The bathroom has a hair dryer, and offers some of the typical hotel fare like small bottles of shampoo, soap etc. The hotel offers breakfast, which can get a bit dicey as far as crowding goes. The breakfast area is nice, bright and clean. Aside from the usual packaged muffins and Danish, they offered a variety of coffee, tea, juice, toast, fresh fruit, and waffle batter to put on a waffle iron. We didn't try them but the fresh-made waffles smelled very good. There is a television in that area. The breakfast area can get crowded, but weather permitting there is a walkway with a seating area just outside the doors with some tables and chairs that seem to attract some very friendly people to share breakfast with. It can get a good crosswind there if it is a windy day, but during the later afternoon and in the evening it is a nice quiet place just to sit without a lot of activity around you. I'm not sure about the fresh fruit left after breakfast; one day there were only a few oranges, and the next day there were oranges and apples. I think they might leave the fruit there until it is gone. The coffee is available 24 hours and it was pretty good. The area is prime \"boardwalk\" and wonderful for those of us who enjoy people and people watching. The Kite Loft is next door and they always fly some lovely colorful kites on the beach in front of the hotel. Aside from the wonderful parade of people, from our balcony we saw dolphins running and there are always many boats from large to small out on the ocean or at the horizon. If you have binoculars it is a good idea to toss them in your suitcase. The sliding glass doors have no screen doors but do have a latch-type lock for security. The balconies are semi-private and though you can't see the people on the next balcony you can hear them and they can hear you if they are out there. At the time we were there there were some tiny little flies that seemed to find their way in through the doors in all three of our units. A bit of bug spray packed in a suitcase may not be a bad idea depending on the time of year. Once again, the Comfort Inn Boardwalk was all we hoped it would be. None of us had any complaints about any of our three units.

There are NO laundry services there, you have to go to a laundry mat 2 blocks away that charge crazy prices.

We always have stayed in oceanfront rooms on the first floor (looking right out at the boardwalk and ocean) so I cannot attest to the other rooms in the main building or the rooms in the back building. Our rooms have always been spacious, clean, and comfortable. This is a higher priced hotel than some on the boardwalk, however we are able to fit more people (six to the rooms we rented) and because it's an efficiency we didn't spend as much money on food during our visit. There is a smaller pool in front of the hotel (between the balcony and boardwalk). I have never used that pool but my family has and they say the water is cold. The indoor pool in the back building is nice and warm and clean. I can compare this place to several other places we've stayed in OC. We've stayed at the Plim Plaza multiple times. I really like the atmosphere and porch at the PP but the rooms are very very small. this year we need room for six people and would have had to get two rooms at the PP.

We have also rented a very nice oceanfront apartment up on 52nd street. It was big enough to sleep 12 so we shared it and the cost with my brother and his family. It was very nice having our own \"space\" big enough for ALL of us and cost us no more than renting two side-by-side rooms at the Comfort Inn however it was on 52nd street and we like the boardwalk atmosphere. I do want to comment on one of the posts above. the poster said, \"two large outdoor pools and an inddor pool) and a jaccuzzi, but also a sauna, an excersize room equipped with Nautilus (!) circuit training equipment, and a tanning bed.\" I do have to say that I have stayed at this hotel multiple times between 2006 and 2009 and have never noticed any of the things the other reviewer mentioned. There is only one smaller outdoor pool and one indoor pool. There is no jacuzzi, sauna, exercise room, or tanning bed. There was also no restaurant as the above reviewer mentioned. I wonder if they got their hotels mixed up. I mention these things only so that people are not misguided. Overall though I HIGHLY recommend this hotel!

The alarm clock did not work at all and you had to hold the blow dryer's \"on\" button the entire time. Our room was set up quite nicely, however, with two queens and a pull out sofa.

Now we focused on the many kites tethered outside the Kite Loft next door, plus a lively beach volleyball game in progress. What fun! And for the first time, we did not have to drive anywhere- the 5th street location is central to many things. Now the housekeeping part: the stove light bulb was missing, the bathroom vent and hairdryer filter were filthy, there was a theater ticket (Ratatouille) from July on a kitchen chair, a piece of dried-up processed cheese was on the kitchen floor, and a cup of cigarette butts in some sort of yellow liquid sat on the balcony of our non-smoking room. And the room phone didn't work (we had cells, but needed to call the front desk- had to walk down). OK, I feel better now :) Back to the good side: the front desk guys were nice, this hotel had a wonderfully warm and not-too-chlorinated indoor pool (it was aptly described as \"a womb\"), and they had a terrific continental breakfast with lots of good coffee, fruit, cereal, muffins, and a waffle iron with plenty of pre-mixed cups of batter.

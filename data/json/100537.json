What made it less than we remembered is that now they no longer offer the complementary wine on Friday/Saturday nights which was always a great event. It is also a walk-up building which makes it a work out if you are on the 3rd floor. Parking is $15 additional, which is still way cheaper than the garage and most lots in the area when there is an event. However, there are only about 11-12 spaces available so you have to check in early enough to claim one. It will still be our choice of place when we are going to the Arena but probably has less amenities than other larger hotels on the other side of the Center.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradenton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhat a find!\u201d", "Author": "kdfrench", "ReviewID": "UR125450932", "Content": "When planning our trip to Seattle, we had originally booked our room at a chain hotel on the other side of town. I was speaking to someone I met through work who had just moved here from Seattle and she recommended the Inn at Queen Anne - we are so glad she did. We got a great rate ($30/night less than the other hotel) and we were closer to all of the attractions that we wanted to visit. The rooms (converted from apartments) are quite large and clean and the staff was extremely nice! I wish I knew the name of the young woman who was working when we checked into the hotel - she was so nice and gave us some really good information about the Queen Anne neighborhood. I have traveled to many large cities and know that quite often, parking is an additional fee. It is at the Inn at Queen Anne as well. We had a car for the first part of our trip and paid $15/night for parking, but had unlimited in and out service. For those readers who have been to NYC, Chicago & DC, you know that this rate is reasonable AND the in and out service is not common. The lot was around the corner and across the street from the hotel (convenient). Later in the trip, we were walking and I saw another downtown hotel was charging $35/night for parking...and I doubt they offered unlimited in and out service. The negatives - 1 - There is no elevator - carrying bags up and down stairs isn't fun, but is tolerable. 2 - If you are someone who wants everything to be pristine and new, this hotel is not for you. My husband and I commented that it reminded us of the apartments we lived in during college or right after college. The carpet (especially on the stairways) is worn, the bathrooms could use a little love (the tubs are nice ceramic, but the tile grout and vanity in our room have both seen better days...however since everything was clean, we didn't care.) 3 - We were offered a room with a view or a quiet room. We opted for the room with the view. The room faces 1st Ave North (a major street) and you can hear buses/cars. If there is an event at Key Arena, you may hear the people as they are leaving. However, as a plus, much like the children's book \"Goodnight Moon\" I said \u201cGood Night Space Needle\u201d every night as I drew our window treatments closed. During our next stay, I think I'd opt for a quiet room, which I assume faces the lovely courtyard between buildings. Heating/cooling - Prior to our trip, we noticed that many viewers complained that they had no control of the room temperatures. I always found our room to be a bit drafty. It wasn't until our last evening that I noticed one of the windows wasn't quite shut all the way. Apparently, a previous quest was too warm and opened it a crack. We closed it and were comfortable. Sadly, closing the window did not eliminate the outdoor traffic/pedestrian noise as I'd hoped.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money.\u201d", "Author": "nishkanu", "ReviewID": "UR124231790", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel three times, each time for 5 days or more, and I will definitely be back.

The hotel doesn't do continental breakfast any more, but there is always coffee available in the lobby, and with the kitchenettes and nearby grocery stores it is no problem to do-it-yourself.

The location is very close to some of the most famous sights in Seattle, such as the Space Needle and Kerry Park. The neighborhood has a ton of good restaurants and (dive) bars that make for an authentic Seattle experience. It is, however, a bit far from downtown.

If you are the type of traveler that stays at three or four star hotels, skip this place. The bathroom fixtures are ancient, the shower heads low, the water pressure lower, and the heating & cooling is out of the 1950s (steam radiators and window AC units). If you must stay in the neighborhood, try the Mediterranean, which is a block away. It is no 3 star hotel but it is a step up in comfort. If you are a veteran of hostels or public houses, the large rooms, kitchenette, and nice staff will make your stay at the Inn pleasant. (The wi-fi is free but clunky.) There are two large grocery stores nearby, so you can do a lot of cooking if you wish; otherwise, the area abounds in ethnic eateries and pubs. This is an old, fairly rundown place in a funky neighborhood. You are right next door to a cheapo hamburger joint that attracts people looking for a $4 dinner (Dick's). While there, I've seen more than one person pay for lunch with quarters and dimes. If you don't want to rub elbows with the hoi polloi, then you are better off staying at the Roosevelt or Red Lion downtown and taking the monorail to Seattle Center/Key Arena, etc. So, bottom line? We come to this neighborhood every year or two from the Midwest. We usually stay at the Mediterranean but I got a Priceline flight & hotel deal at the Inn. Would I stay here again?

The rooms are not huge or fancy by any means, but clean and quaint and have a fully-equipped kitchenette and small refrigerator, so you can save even more by preparing your own food. Gas stove though, so you may have to ask for matches from the front counter. Since I mention them, staff are friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Hair dryers are available at the front desk, there's an ice machine and a laundry room; you can either wash your own clothes in their coin-op machines, or spoil yourself and use their laundry service, which is not cheap. Earplugs may be necessary for light sleepers, as the area is quite busy, and the A/C unit lets in a lot of street noise. We had no problem with this, but some might. Parking is cheap at $15 per night, but not very convenient, as it's in the underground garage at the neighboring Marqueen Hotel. It's valet parking, so they can have it ready for you on request, but you have to walk the block or so to get it. This was a non-issue for us, as we didn't need it all weekend, and felt safe knowing it was secure in a locked garage. There is coffee available in the lobby, which is adequate for a caffeine fix, but those with more discerning tastes might just want to go to the Starbuck's immediately around the corner.

Surprised that the bathroom didn't have an electrical outlet, and don't forget to bring a hairdryer, as none is provided. There was a window along the shower/tub wall with no real way to keep the water away from it. The paint had peeled and there was a lot of black mold along the window sill and cracks in the waterproof wall material.

She offered me a room on any of the three floors. I took the third floor even though the hotel doesn't have an elevator, because I thought it would be quieter. The actual climb up the stairs wasn't too bad. The room itself was pretty small, but had a queen-size bed, a kitchen unit with a two-burner gas range, a refrigerator, and a decent selection of cookware and plates. The closet was pretty large with plenty of room to hang up clothes. There was a small table and two small chairs, and an arm chair in the corner. The bathroom was pretty cramped, but had a full-size bathtub with shower. The room was nice and clean and I could see the Space needle from my window. The bed was pretty comfy. The heat was a bit strong the first night. It can be adjusted the old-fashioned way by turning a valve on the steam radiator at the window. It was winter, so I didn't use the air-conditioner, but it looked pretty new. The hotel has free wireless Internet. The only complaint about the room was that the bed barely fit between the bathroom door and the other side of the room where the entrance door was, so the \"bedside\" table was actually several feet away on the other side of the bathroom door. The first night I moved it near the bed where it partially blocked the bathroom door so I could put my glasses, phone, wallet, and stuff like that on it. The second night I just put that stuff on the top of the bed board that was couple of inches wide. The location is great. There are numerous restaurants nearby, and it's a great place to start from if you are using public transportation to get around. I took a bus and train to the airport from there in about an hour and it only cost $4.50. The room seemed quiet, maybe because I was so high up, and I was happy to be able to open the windows for some fresh air and to lean out to take a photo of the Space Needle.

I can't complain about the locaton--it is nestled in the heart of a fun, eclectic neighborhood with unique shops and restaurants--but I cannot complain enough about the Inn itself. We entered the room and was immediately shocked at the general appearence of the room. Sure, we had made these plans ahead of time knowing that we would be sacrificing some of the amenities of a more expensive hotel for location, but this was god damn ridiculous. This place is not an Inn. It's a very old pre-war apartment building that has been converted into a hotel. We've stayed in old conversions before that are quaint and charming--these owners, however, did not take the time to hide the fact that it used to be residential living for smelly, middle-class hippies Fine--the place didn't look great. Big deal. We went and explored the area and when we returned to take a nice hot shower and relax for the night, we were horrified to discover that the room doesn't have a shower--instead, it has a very large drippy faucet where you'd expect a shower head to be. We went and immediately complained to the front office and were given a stock excuse--something about the age of the building and that sprinklers had been running all day (an obvious lie, the surrounding lawn is an ugly yellow). They later sent a \"water engineer\" and our bathroom shower was upgraded to a \"light mist\". What truly put us over the edge was waking up to find ourselves COVERED in itchy, painful, oozing red marks. We're from a metropolitan city--and combined with the small, reddish stains that appeared on the sheets over night--we knew instantly that this establishment is CRAWLING in bed bugs. Most people won't realize this as only a small minority of the population actually exhibits symptoms once bitten, but let me tell you, we have never been bitten more in one night than our stay at the Queen Anne. If there was any doubt about what happened while we were sleeping, it was quickly destroyed when we actually found a live bug behind one of the pillows--and upon picking it up in a tissue, was greeted with a nice splurt of oozing blood. This is not a knock against the staff or the hotel's intentions. It's a decent building, great staff, and amazing location. It just happens to be infested.

Working in a Hotel in the U.K I always try to be less critical when travelling as I fully appreciate the hard work and passion that is needed for this particular industry. I have a few major gripes with this property, firstly the amount of time we had to wait for the room. I appreciate that check in time is 3pm however, I am also fully aware that this is a guideline and following good practice there is a way of putting the rooms on priority in order to meet guests needs as much as possible. Prior to arriving at the Hotel I telephoned to see if there was any possibility of getting into a room as we were exhausted and needed to have a shower. I was told they will do what can, when arrived was informed the room was not ready and asked to check back about in about an hour which we did do, then to check again at 1pm which we did and then checked again at 2pm, we eventually got into our room at about 2.50pm. I found this to be a little excessive and extremely annoying as there were also not many arrivals at this time. So we then went to our room after dragging our heavy suitcases up the numerous steps and flights of stairs to walk down a corridor that smelt of a hospital ward consistently ( a couple of plug in air freshners may have resolved this!). The room was in desperate need of maintenance. The ceiling looked like it was falling down! Obviously been painted over on numerous occasions however the corner with pieces hanging down were obviously missed or not picked up as needing attention. Also the pipe in the Bathroom got very hot at times and was no notice or sign warning guests of this considering it was in the way of getting into the shower. I think Housekeeping did a good job considering what they had to work with. It was very hot over the few days that we spent there and was actually quite shocked to find no air conditioning, however we could of coped with just the ceiling fan and the window open, if we were not literally on top of noisy ac units which were just outside our window from other properties. A suggestion maybe to equip these noisier rooms with Air Conditioning. On our last night we were disturbed throughout the evening a a group of High School Teenagers, who seemed to be allowed to roam free. The final straw was when one of them tried to get into our room at about midnight and then 15 mins later knocking on our door. The night Manager did respond promptly to our complaint. I then asked if it was possible to get a late checkout on our last day as our flight was not until 10pm Was told straight away a definate No, not that i will check and get back to you etc etc.. even though I offered to pay half or even full rate so we could rest ahead of a long flight. I was even more annoyed that when we were returned and collected our luggage just after 6pm, it was being stored in a clean room which we could of easily had and payed for, the same was true when we arrived and took our luggage to a clean room whilst we waited 5 hours to get into ours. The continental breakfast consisted of a few pastries, fresh coffee and tea laid out in the Reception Area. Overall the staff were pleasant enough, they do need to be trained in Customer Care skills and be more Accommodating to guests needs.

A later conversation with manager Chris reserved a 2 bed room and on check-in that's what we got - a room with a twin and a \"queen\" bed, although it really looked and slept like a double bed.

We chose the Inn at Queen Anne because of its proximity to the Experience Music Project, The Space Needle and the funky shops and eateries nearby. The hotel was described as \"quaint\" and the pictures on the hotel website were nice, so we gave it a shot. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted with the carpet in the lobby , filthy and torn. Uh-oh, I thought, not a good sign. The front desk had overbooked and even though we had paid for and confirmed our reservations for late arrival 2 weeks prior, they only had one room left with 2 beds. We took it and hurriedly left our things in the room to go grab a quick bite. Upon returning and getting into bed I noticed that the room had no A/C, the windows would not open and that my son's double bed was clean, however the twin they put me in had hairy sheets and was in a former closet. I am not talking about an old fashioned wall pull-out bed-this was actually a tiny twin bed stuffed in a closet. I went into the kitchenette to put my leftovers in the fridge and the fridge had mold in it and did not work. I went to the desk to complain, was told there was nothing that could be done, so we sucked it up and tried to sleep. I took the sheets of my bed and used my sons blanket, but eventually the closet got so stuffy I jumped into my sons bed that at least had a fan above it. In the morning we experienced plumbing issues with the toilet and shower and bugs in the bathroom. Upon packing up I looked under the bed to make sure we got everything and discovered possessions from someone who had stayed there before we did. The housekeepers did not clean under the beds or change the sheets. We canceled the rest of our stay and decided to leave Seattle and drove to Anacortes where we stayed at the Cap Sante' Inn- which was a palace compared to where we had been the night before. I wrote to the manager of the Queen Anne requesting a refund. I received a letter back saying a refund could not be given, however they gave me a coupon to stay again. As if I would ever use it. The word \"Quaint\" that Queen Anne uses in their advertising is not the same as \"Rundown\". My advice to anybody staying there, upon check in go to the room, give it the white glove inspection and make sure everything is in working order before you agree to stay in it. By the way, the Queen Anne had a policy that if you reserve the room they charge your card immediately and will not give a refund without 72 hours advance cancellation.

We did. I didn't enjoy it. It is underneath a grocery store and there are a million pigeons in it (they make a serious mess, and I think you get the picture).

All of the tiles around the fixtures in the shower/tub were falling off the wall. Literally. The only thing that was holding them in place was the fact that they were attached to each other and their weight held them up there. The paint in the bathroom looked like it hadn't been painted since the building was built (and that wasn't recently). The black mold all over everything was a real nice touch also. You have to ignore a problem like this for a long time to get fur that long. The rooms all come with a small switch/hub for internet.

It is still possible to get around by bus but there are numerous routes and figuring them out on your own isn't easy. Seattle buses have a Free Ride Zone in the downtown area but be advised that this hotel is not within this zone. It will cost $1.50 to get downtown during peak (I used Bus #15). Get a transfer ticket and you'll be able to ride back for free if your within a couple of hours. It is also possible to walk downhill to the waterfront (about 15-25 minutes) to catch the free Waterfront rail line. However, be advised that this rail is not running either but there is a substitute bus (Bus #99). This bus supposedly arrives every 20 minutes but the wait seemed much longer to me. If you're looking to take a city tour, the tour bus that I went on picked me up at the hotel. I would think that most tour buses would do the same. Also, the Duck's tour is at the Seattle Center across the street from the Experience Music Project (EMP). Other than the public transportation issues, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

There is a continental breakfast offered with coffee, OJ, and rolls - there may be more I was not sure as my husband just went down one morning to get me some OJ and a roll. I can say the roll and OJ was tasty and fresh. The maid server was very nice and did a good job on cleaning daily. There is high speed internet available in the rooms, which is a plus if you are like me and have a traveling office which requires you to work while out of town. Location is absolutely wonderful. Walking distance to space needle and Key arena activities, many restaurants close by and the metro bus lines are right there to take you where ever you little heart desires at a very reasonable small fee. PLUS a grocery store right across the street, drug store about 1 block away some smaller businesses like office supplies etc! How wonderful is this. The staff pointed out that is is about the same price to take a Towncar from the Sea-Tac then a taxi. And they have one that they recommend. I mean why not we did ~ hmmm Taxi or Towncar.. not really to hard of a decision there for the same price. I am sure the shuttle may of been a few dollars cheaper, so if you don't mind a 1 1/2 hour shuttle ride to save nothing more then a couple bucks then take the shuttle, otherwise the towncar is the way to go between airport and the Inn At Queen Anne. Cons: The pillows could be a little fluffier. We solved that by asking for a couple more pillows which the staff supplied without hesitation. There is not that much hot water or pressure. We stayed there for 6 nights and found that if at all possible take your shower around noon or a little after. There is really no need to turn on the cold water knob when taking a shower and the shower head can be rotated to help with the pressure aspect. Other then them two small issues really just one the water pressure (the pillows can be solved by asking for more pillows) - I cannot say anything negative about the Inn At Queen Anne\" Again this is not the Hilton or even the Radisson it is a small 1930's quaint Inn located in a nice area and for the age still holds her head fairly high. It shows and feels charactor. You can almost feel the history within the walls. And the price cannot be beat! We will stay there again if we have a need to go to Seattle again!", "Date": "November 10, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Inn at Queen Anne", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100537-Reviews-Inn_at_Queen_Anne-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$85 - $130*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">505 First Ave. N</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98102</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "100537", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/26/65/0f/inn-at-queen-anne.jpg"}}

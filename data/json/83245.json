We had a couple drinks at the bar but their draft beer selection is lacking (only Bud Light?!?!) so I went with the local Stone beer which was good.

I looked around for other places, and the Bristol was everything I was looking for. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE: I talked to a real front desk employee when I called the reservations line. The decor is exquisite and charming. The staff is courteous and willing. I bothered them several times for early check in, various odds and ends that I had forgotten, directions to attractions, random pictures, etc. They were very patient and helpful. Their decor is modern, dynamic, and attractive--the property really does look as it appears on the website. Cleanliness is clearly a top priority at this property, down to small details--I returned after housekeeping not only to find that everything had been restored and restocked, but my housekeeper had actually arranged my toiletries on my countertop in a more visually pleasing array. I felt taken care of. I also had an emergency with my packed clothes getting stained on the flight over, but their same-day dry cleaning service had me covered. LOCATION: I never questioned my safety here, even when walking home at night, alone. Don't tempt the fates, of course, but The Bristol is secure. It is also very close to several remarkable restaurants and shopping centers--closer than a lot of the larger hotels, actually. If you need to save money like I did, you might find that walking is a real option here, with distances that won't leave you sore and out of breath. SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS: I would have liked a heads up on some of the events that were happening in town during my stay, like foot races, comedy shows, or live bands. But I don't see this being a big issue, a lot of folks probably come to San Diego with a full itinerary anyway.

We made our plans at the last minute, and I was stressing to find a nice hotel that would allow us to bring our very large and well-behaved dog Rudy with us. Most hotels either did not allow any pets, or limited the pet to a very small size. The Bristol, a charming boutique hotel less than a block from Horton Plaza, had no objection and were, in fact, so friendly to Rudy The Dog that he looked forward to strolling through the elegant marble-floored lobby area near the desk staff. There is a small grassy area on the north side of the hotel property, across the trolley tracks, to walk your dog, and a convenient trash receptical sits at the corner. I brought plenty of doggy-bags which was a great idea, because none seemed to be offered anywhere. Our original reservation for four nights was lengthened to eight nights, which should tell you that we really enjoyed our stay. Our upgraded King Bed room ran 109 plus 26/night for valet parking (no self-park). With tax it totalled about 149/night plus daily tips for maid and valet. The other TA reviews do a good job of describing the hotel property, and I'll just add that our room was beautiful (sixth floor, northeast corner). Amenities include terry-robes in the closet, room service and friendly staff. The Greyhound terminal is across the street from the hotel on First Avenue, so street noise may have been less in our room, which faced the opposite direction. I would gladly recommend The Bristol to anyone looking for a beautiful boutique hotel, strategically located near so much to see and do, in the heart of San Diego. If you're bringing your four-legged friend, you should know that I walked Rudy from the hotel, through Balboa Park to a fantastic dog park with grass, trees, and a doggy-water-fountain. There is also a \"dogs-allowed-off-leash\" Dog Beach in Ocean Beach, a short drive away. Please note that we never left Rudy in the room by himself - so there was no issue of barking or disturbing other guests. If you bring your canine companion, please act responsibly so that great hotels like The Bristol will continue their Dog-Friendly policies. Thank you Bristol staff.

The hotel was nice and modern - though I think you could \"modernize\" any hotel with the right bed spread and wallpaper. The positive things included a friendly staff, close proximity to public transit as well as Gaslamp [a short walk of only a couple blocks], big windows, and a well-stocked honor [woo hoo!] mini bar. The negatives were the noise and an uncomfortable bed, and cramped tub. There is a bus station right across the street and if you like to sleep with the windows open like I do, you will be woken up constantly from 4am on, by the non-stop clamor of buses - beeping, clanging, engines, oh my. We didn't sleep very well until we gave in on the third night - closed the windows and ran the A/C instead. The bed was uncomfortable for me [and I'm not picky] - the mattress was too firm, and the pillows were the kind that are so squishy-soft that your head sinks through them with no support.The bathtub is also one of those teasers with the slanted back begging you to lay back, if only the tub wasn't so close to the wall that there's nowhere to put your neck and head. Now that's torture, especially after you've hit the mini bar. We ordered a lot of room service from the Daisy cafe downstairs and the food was mostly very good, though not many light/fresh breakfast options [mostly different versions of eggs and potatoes]. But the Irish Cream[?] Cheesecake was phenomenal. Also, the hotel requests that you leave your recyclables out of the room trash can which, I appreciate, but it would be nice if they provided and alternate bin so the trash is not just sitting around everywhere. Also Also, [Bristol, if you're listening] if you're going to be earth-conscious enough to recycle, then why do you put little [non-recyclable] laminated cards in each room every day with the days weather on it?

Not only was it my reunion, but also the first night away from our precious newborn son, we were looking forward to a night away and sleeping in for the first time in four months! :) Both the ball room and our hotel room were nice enough, but the customer service was appalling. As it was our 20th reunion and we were seeing friends we had not seen in years we were told about the hotels \"no party policy\", but told we would be able to socialize as late as we like in the hotel lobby as it was two floors below the nearest hotel room. And just to clarify \"socialize\", I was giggling with old girlfriends while sitting on a couch in the lobby, not yelling, screaming and running up and down the halls. After following these guidelines, and catching up with friends in the lobby as requested, I returned to my hotel room (where my husband was sound asleep) to a party being broken up by security across the hall. I entered my room only to receive a knock on the door moments later by a security guard saying we were being evicted. When I asked why, she said she had received complaints about a party in our room. When I invited her in to see that my husband was sleeping and had been for hours and that I was just returning from the lobby, she said it didn't matter and left. Within an hour two police were knocking on our door to evict us!!! When we asked for an explanation we were told they could evict whomever they chose for any reason and they did not need to give an explanation. Really?!?!?! When we asked for their names, they refused to give them, which to me is an automatic admission of fault. The worst part is that the group having the party across the hall, also alumni, had received multiple visits from security and we later found out they were not evicted. We chose to wait a day to contact administration to cool off a bit, as we were understandably upset. The way the situation was handled by the management was equally, if not more appalling. We were hung up upon by management on our first call, the administrative assistant at the main office refused to give us the email of the president, as the one online was no longer valid, and when we finally received a response by those in upper management, we were threatened not to post a review in travel blogs.

This was done with no problem at all but I was told this wasn't a party hotel so they couldn't do anything about noise at 6pm. I totally understand that but if that was the noise at 6pm then what happens next?! Also the party hotel line made me laugh as someone had put posters up in the lift saying Party Reunion 9th floor. We moved rooms and it was silent until 2am when the party continued outside our hotel room. We took it into our own hands to tell them to be quiet. So it wasn't a party hotel..... Anyway, everything was fine until our final night. We had an early flight so were eager to get a good night's rest. At around 12.30am we were awoken by water and the sound of drips. There was streams of water coming through the ceiling on to us and the floor. The bathroom was soaked with water and the bedroom was on its way. We called the staff and they began to sort things out. Apparently upstairs had left their shower on. (not a party hotel though....) and we were to be moved to a smoking room. Strange has this was a non smoking hotel? Ah said reception, the person had smoked in it and couldn't get rid of the smell yet. (not a party hotel though) So after our room was flooded, through no fault of ours we should be moved to some stinky room? Ehh what? Eventually they found another room and it didn't smell. We could once again hear the person next door and we worked out that any room with an adjoining room allows you to hear every little sound. This new room was also next to the ice machine so we got very little sleep that night. The next day we were given our bill for valet asked about our stay - reception seemed oblivious to what had happened. When we explained we presumed that we would be offered something, free valet parking, free breakfast, something - no. An apology. So when our valet bill was presented to us I asked if we could get that taken off. We were given more than that off, just about $50 which was fine. I just wanted a token at that point but in hindsight I should have pushed. It was disappointing that it was very much of a case of don't ask don't get. In any hotel I've stayed in before they have always offered remunerations to make up for something that went wrong - a flooded room certainly deserved more than an apology. Would I go back? Nope. Should you go? possibly, but ask for a room without an adjoining room for a bit more peace and quiet.

Marcia(I apologize if I didn't get the name correctly) greeted us in the morning, she stored our bags and gave walking directions to Embarcadero. Ahmad was at the desk when we came back later that evening. He checked us in and was a big helper during both days we stayed there. Ahmad gave us directions to Old Town and showed how to use trolley. He was on duty every time we'd come into the lobby and answered all our questions. He also presented us with complimentary drink coupons which we used in the bar before going to bed. The room was a good size, clean and nicely decorated. There were all necessary amenities including minibar which we didn't use. The view from our window was of a Greyhound station but we haven't heard any street noise at all. The best feature probably was a good working A/C as it was very hot in SD that week.

But to her defense she was barking because the maid was outside of our room cleaning other rooms. But it was never a constant bark. So I went downstairs to explain this to the front desk concierge and she was rude to me. She said she was rude because I was being sarcastic. I know no one wants to hear a yapping dog all hours of the day but to even get calls that she's barking is a bit too much. I am a guest too. And the hotel says Pet-Friendly yet every time a dog barks everyone with dogs are called and told that someone is complaining about a dog. Why put the dogs on one designated floor and even entertain calls about barking dogs. I feel like the other guest should be told that the floor they'll be staying on has dogs and there will be occasional dog barks. To me it's like someone complaining about hearing a baby crying. So I didn't feel comfortable and I did not feel welcomed at all. I was about to leave early and drive back to L.A. even though I was sore from running. I can't say my stay was great because that really put me in a sour mood. I never received complaints about my dog before and she's stayed in other hotels. And I've never been talked to like that before from a Front Desk Attendant. The rooms are Ok. I had to call the Front Desk to send up a plunger cause the toilet almost overflowed. The toilet also leaked throughout our stay. The rugs look like rugs in Las Vegas casinos. The flat screen TV's are not hooked up properly. The quality is poor.

A bus stop is at the corner, and you can get to other San Diego attractions from there. We went to the Zoo. Need a cab? They had a private one waiting for us early in the morning to take us to the airport. Not really a cab, more like a limo.

There is a parking garage right down the street that is 10 dollars less a day on week days and 16 dollars less on weekends that will save a few dollars. It may be worth it for longer stays. The public transit has a stop right outside The Bristol door which is super nice. Public transit in San Diego is a must as finding parking anywhere downtown / harbor area is IMPOSSIBLE.

Booked this for location and was extremely pleased. It was $90 cheaper than Westin's group rate and it is only about 300 yrds away. I booked the standard king room for 127/night. The room was in good shape and modern. There was a coffee pot with Seattle's best coffee. The soaps and bath products were natural and of good quality and replaced daily. Room was clean with black marble countertops and good water pressure. the minibar was one where you could place your own stuff in it. Bar did happy hour daily with 1/2 off appetizers. The app I had was fantastic and Debbie in the bar was great. (bar closes at ten though)Check in with Derek was easy and they honored my request for quiet room by placing me on backside of hotel. Five pillows on king bed and bed was comfortable. One light had a built in ipod dock and speaker. Elevators were quick and there was a bowl of green apples available at the desk for free. The hotel is across from the bus station but never felt unsafe or saw any issues. There are several nice hotels in this area and seemed policed quite well. High speed internet in room worked well and without issue. Also, there is an in room safe large enough for laptops. The only thing missing was the lack of paper cups to take coffee to go when I was walking to the seminar. The rooms had glass coffee cups. However, when checking out, the clerk asked if there was any one recommendation I could make to improve their service. she actually wrote my suggestion and said it was a good one. She may have been making me feel good but the point was that this hotel seems to care about how to improve its service and actually asked the question. The room could be a five star room but the hotel lacks the amenities of a five star hotel (concierge, spa, full business center) but doesn't have a five star price so all is good. There wasn't a pool and no business center but there are computers with printers in the lobby. I was very happy with my stay and would definately stay here again.......especially at this price point as it is one of the best values around. Other points. Hotel is at the (North?) edge of the gaslamp district and can be a little bit of a hike to petco or some of the places down towards Market. There is a Panera Bread, 7/11, wendys, Pizza Hut, sushi, quiznos within 1 block. Starbucks is about 2 blocks near the mall.

We stayed at the Bristol Hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. All I can say is WOW. What a great hotel. The staff was extremely friendly (Ahmad, Marisol and Heather) and very helpful in recommending places to eat as well as how to move around SD using public transit (which by the way is wonderful). Also, we could easily walk to Seaport Village (on the bay), Little Italy, Horton Plaza (outdoor mall) and many restaurants. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Talk about clean, this hotel was spotless (lobby, public restrooms and rooms). I'm extremely picky about cleanliness and found this to be one of the cleanest hotels I've stayed in. We were upgraded to a king room with the extra sitting area which was nice. I thought the room was plenty big and nicely decorated in a modern chic way. We were located on the 5th floor. We didn't have view at all. Faced the backside of another building. However, we weren't in the room that much so this really didn't bother us. However, it is worth mentioning. The bathroom was large enough to accomodate two people getting ready and has the best water pressure I've ever felt. And, the contoured shower curtain rod was a nice plus. Another plus was the wall-mounted lighted magnification mirror. There's also a small coffee pot on the bathroom vaniety with tea and coffee (we didn't use it but it's available). The only thing I would upgrade in the bathroom (and in the hotel room in general) is the lighting. I thought the room was a little too dark. The king-size bed was very comfortable complete with a down comforter and luxury sheets. Slept great. I know some complained about the street noise, but we didn't hear a thing except once or twice a siren went off. The hotel itself was extremely quiet. And, the free high speed internet was great. Didn't have any trouble connecting at all. There have been a couple reviews about the area itself. You are right in the middle of everything. We did a ton of walking and always felt safe. San Diego definitely has a homeless problem. It's very evident all over the city. But, we didn't feel threatened or intimidated by this at all. Like I said, it's all over the city and definitely around the tourist areas. Our last day we ate breakfast at the Bristol and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was great with a good selection for breakfast. It was a little pricey, but so are many restaurants in San Diego. On a final note I would definitely recommend the Bristol.

Total for 5 days was $488. I was blown away by this hotel. Room wasn't ready when I got there at 1, so I checked my bags with the bellman, and went explore the city for a couple of hours. The hotel is within walking distance to the many restaurants/bars on 4th and 5th (Gaslamp Quarter), is a block from Horton Plaza, and less than a block from the trolley stop. I came back around 3 and was told that because I joined the Bristol Loyalty Club before arriving, that I was being upgraded to the larger King room. Everyday serendipities during vacations make my trips extra special. The lobby is standard with a restaurant/bar right off the front desk. Around the corner to the elevators is a very chic area that has some couches. Throughout my stay as I came out of the elevators, I saw guests lounging here. Good meeting spot. There was also a pc and printer set up near here - good for me to print my boarding passes. There is free wifi in the rooms, but I did not have a printer, so this was very convenient. My room was on the 5th floor, at the end of the hall (I think room 506). I was very impressed with the size, cleanliness, and decor of the room. Very contemporary. There was an LCD tv, big dresser (I unpack if the trip is longer than 2 days), closet had plenty of hangers along with a safe and iron/ironing board, suitable work desk, and the bathroom was perfect. Not huge, but plenty of room, nice plush bath mat, great tub/shower, and all of the standard bath amenities. Bed was super comfy, and had more than enough pillows. One thing that I always complain about is the lack of electrical outlets in hotel rooms. This wasn't the case at the Bristol. And the alarm clock radio/mp3 dock was a nice bonus. My first night sleep was a little noisy. Everytime a trolley came to the stop just about right outside my window, I could hear the loud whistle of the electic motors. And the police sirens were annoying, but I thought hey, I am right in the middle of the city, and it's not near as bad as Manhattan. The next day I realized my windows were open. Duh!!! I closed them, and it was like locking my self in a sound proof chamber. One note is there is also central ac. I guess this isn't common in all San Diego hotels. With temps in the mid 70's and low 60's at night, it wasn't needed by me (I live in Florida where I deal with high 90's in the summer). Houesekeeping knocked on my door everyday by 10 am, and I usually wasn't ready. When I came back in the afternoons, everything was made up like new. My housekeeper even organized all of my personal toiletries on a hand towel in the bathroom. I wish that I could remember the names of the hotel staff that were so great - and I mean everyone that I enteracted with: the front desk, the bellman, housekeeper, night auditor - everyone was fantastic. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the ice machine was on the third floor, so it was a pain to refill my ice bucket. But that won't change how I feel about this hotel. I will 100% stay here again on my next trip to San Diego, and recommend this hotel to anyone that is going. Truly a remarkable hotel right in the middle of everything. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, and the Westin a block or so away was over $300 a night. The Bristol was a better deal, with nicer staff, and even the bed was more comfy than Westin's Heavenly Bed. I don't give these comments lightly, as I love Starwood. But the Bristol earned my repeat business with every touch along the way. Thank you Bristol. I will be back.

It's in walking distance of the Gaslamp area as well as most of the things you'd want to do downtown, so the location is great. Finally, the only downside was the nearest grassy areas to take the dog. One is on the street where the train/tram runs and a lot of homeless people hang out, so I was a little uncomfortable taking the dog out late at night - I instead sent my husband. The other grassy area is near the mall, so it's a nicer area, but it's a couple of blocks away, so not as convenient for a quick bathroom break.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southborough, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "Bostongirl1", "ReviewID": "UR63529162", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at The Bristol 4/29 - 5/2.

PS....Come in December before Christmas....the hotel is empty!!...this helped me get a great rate.

They're very accomodating and super nice. ***3) Ipod docks in most rooms ***4) Nice sized (37 inch maybe?) LCD TV ***5) Excellent water pressure in shower ***6) Comfortable bed and nice linens (although pillows are a bit on the firm side and a mix of a few soft ones to choose from out of the 4 they give you would've been nice) ***7) Ample closet space, especially for single traveler, including safe and iron/board ***8) Free WiFi (not the fastest but certainly adequate) ***9) Nice common areas (hallways, lobby) ***10) Nice large dresser ***11) All rooms non-smoking CONS: ***1) Noise! I stayed in room 711 and the noise was present but not overwhelming. I got \"upgraded\" to a deluxe king in room 707 which is closer to C street and further from Broadway. The room has many more windows which are pretty bad at keeping noise out. The room is basically on top of the trolley line and both nights in this room I've been woken up around 5:45-6am by the trolley and the garbage trucks at the adjacent building. As almost all rooms face First street, it might be wise to request one closer to Broadway and further from C, and don't get a deluxe king unless you absolutely need the room because the increase in windows = much more noise. ***2) No full length mirror in rooms ***3) Lighting in bathrooms (in shower is fine) is terrible. ex...can't see properly while shaving/doing hair. ***4) Room lighting is poor as it all comes from lamps, no overhead lighting ***5) No fridge ***6) Coffee pot old ***7) No fan in bathroom, only some old wooden boards used as a cheap ceiling ***8) Bathroom doors are sliding doors that don't completely close, which might be uncomfortable is staying with someone else. ***9) Strange.....sometimes the water from sink faucet was only hot no matter what handle you turned on Neutral - ***1) Not sure if a pro or con, but there is a small gym with 3 cardio pieces and a small weight machine....no free weights. ***2) $26/night parking Overall - For the price I paid it was more than worth it and if I was staying longer I would request to get out of this particularly loud room.

Housekeeping did a fairly good job in keeping the lobby area, elevator and common areas in a clean manner. Only downfall here was I felt as if the rooms and bathrooms could use a little more cleaning. Upon checking, noticed a bit of soap scum around the sink area (Not like it was a big deal, but still). Room otherwise, was clean and everything seemed to be in accord during check in. Only thing I didnt like was the fact that there were no plastic mats for the baththub. 3.5/5 here Service: No issues here in regard to service put out by concierge. Check in was fast and easy. I know I previously heard horror stories of non-retrieved reservations etc. Booked everything through expedia and upon my arrival, everything was good to go. I was even able to check in early. Staff was more than friendly during check out (think her name was Juana) and placed an extremely small hold on my credit card. Check out again was also seamlessly easily. Had a late flight and reservation desk was very accommodating with providing me with a 2pm checkout. Couldn't ask for better. Hands down, 4/5 here. Location: My opinion! I couldn't have picked a better spot! Gas Lamp District is close by, Horton Plaza is in walking distance, not to mention the Trolley and the wonderful restaurants that lie downtown San Diego. 10 minute walk to the bay area and 10 minute trip to the airport. Hmm, what else. Oh yeah, Little Italy is close by and all major interstates are within minutes. Previous reviews indicated that the area is pretty rough and noisy, but I can honestly that is SO NOT THE CASE. Don't get me wrong, the Greyhound is right across the street but to be honest with you, the noise wasn't that bad at all and my room was adjacent to the Greyhound. I can look out the window and see the buses pulling it but Noise was minimal. The worst you ever heard was the bus backing out and the odd fire truck in the dead still of night. There are a lot of homeless people in the vicinity but most of them lured more around the corner of First & Broadway. I went out many late nights and not once did anyone approach me..so overall I would say..you're pretty safe and its not all that noisy (4/5) Room: Room was of fair size. Amenities were decent. Only thing I didn't like with the room is there really is no fan or ventilation in the bathroom. I kind of liked the idea of the slide in bathroom door. Wireless internet in the room was pretty quick. Only downfall is that after three days you have to get a new password from front desk. Beds were comfy and I can honestly say that I had a good night sleep (even being across from the greyhound). Only other thing I didnt like was the fact that they blasted the AC and the only way to warm the room up was by turning on the heat. Walls are pretty thin so many times you can clearly hear your neighbour speaking and I mean you can hear EVERYTHING lol haha (3.75/4). Other than that no complaints. Overall, this hotel was definitely a different experience as it isn't your typical chain hotel. Hotel staff were very friendly. I like the ipod dock for the rooms. It was actually cool to put my ipod on and listen to some tunes before going to bed. Hotel is still undergoing some renovations so waiting for the elevator takes a while at times. Also, the swipe cards are pretty annoying. I had to get my card reactivated two-three times. But again, this could be attributed to the renovations that are happening. I would probably stay at this hotel again for the above mentioned reasons.

The San Diego omelet would have been good if they would stick to the ingrediants listed on the menu, but instead they also add green bells and red onion and a lot of both that of course steal the show.

The vent was always blowing, so when the unit did not sense to turn on the vents would just blow cool air until the the sensor sensed that it needed to kick on the heat.

We chose the hotel because it had some of the best reviews within the Gas Light district, for the price range we were looking for, and for the modern style we wanted. Overall I thought that the experience there was fantastic, and I would recommend it to friends and family. They had attentive and friendly service, clean rooms, and a simple modern feel to the decor. We got a king deluxe room, and the prices then were $229/night. (With the bad economy, they are now $159). It was in a great location. Just around the corner was the mall, where we grabbed a coffee every morning, and only a few blocks up was the main drag, where all the restaurants, and night life was. So, we were relaxed when having an extra drink. Here's some things to think about.. 1) We were on the 7th floor, and although not distracting or overwhelming, we could still hear the traffic below. So, try to get a room as high as you can. 2) There is NO full length mirror in your room/bathroom, and the large 1/2 length mirror does not have a light over/around it. So, when getting ready for a romantic night out, I had to go out to the hallway by the elevators to see what my outfit looked like. And, I had to use the smaller bathroom mirror to put make-up on and fix my hair. This meant that my boyfriend and I had to share the bathroom anytime we were getting ready to go out. 3) Small bathroom. There's a bunch of open space between the bed and the dresser/tv, and the bed and the surrounding walls, but the bathroom was scaled down to accomodate the \"open\" feel of the main room. 4) Parking isn't free to guests. This is normal for San Diego (and most other cities, these days). We knew ahead of time... which, you may already know, too. But, keep that in mind when choosing a hotel. The Bristol charged $24/night, which is an average price. Some hotels charge more - so be aware of that. I would stay there again, for sure.

Nice lobby area, concierge is always on duty even when we were rerturning at 2am or 3am. Very close to the airport. You can take a bus or a cab for $6 one way. The walk is probably 1/2 hour. We booked the cheapest room through Hotels.com. Standard king size room for around $140 a night. Rooms - very nice and modern. Very clean and spacious. Enough space to hang clothes and lots of shelves to store your items. Shower is great. They also provide all the high quality shampoos and soaps as well as robes. Lots of towels. Bathroom is very clean and spacious. Bed is very comfortable and soft. We had a king and it was huge. Nice flat screen TV with lots of channels. They have a clock radio and advertise it to have an MP3 docking station. I didn't find any docking station but the radio does have a CD player. Great quality full size iron and a hair dryer. Air conditioning worked great. It's a little tricky to turn it on. All you have to do is to bring the handle completely down and it will start making noise - letting out air. After 10-15 minutes it cools down really nicely. Other little thing that might be a little tricky is a door handle that opens your room. It opens up instead of usual down. We had 2 key cards and on the third day they stopped working. I brought them down to concierge and they gave us new ones, explaining that if you put those cards with cell phone, credit cards or any metalic material, the key cards get demagnitized. They appologized numerous times for the inconvenience. Hotel located very central on 1st ave. and is short walking distance to 4th, 5th and 6th avenues of the Gaslamp district where all the action is at night. Hotel is located near Greyhound bus terminal that works 24 hrs and you might hear at night some noise due to that. It didn't bother me at all but my wife mentioned that she woke up few times early in the morning because of that. But nothing major. The hotel provides a free internet in the lobby. They have 1 computer that you can use any time of day or night. If you are renting a car, don't expect much help from the help desk. They called around to find us best deal and offered us \"the cheapest and most available\" rate of $50 before taxes. My wife and I went online and found a great deal with Fox Rental for $22 a day. Elevators at the hotel are actually pretty slow. At one point we waited for 10 minutes for the elevator to come. We ended up taking stairs. But on average it was fine. Many times it was right there with no wait. First day when going down to Lobby level, our elevator dropped to Parking level even though we pressed L. And I mean dropped. The free fall happened from level L to level P. Nothing major, just one floor. We just pressed L and went back up. The doors didn't open automatically, so we pressed Doors Open button and everything was fine. We mentioned it to front desk and they took care of it. We parked our car at the hotel for $22 a night. You have unlimitted access to your car and valet parking parks it for you and brings it back when needed. We tried to park at a nearby parking for $10 a night but you had to be there at 6am or 7am the latest to pick it up. Otherwise, they charge additional $6 an hour after that. I wasn't going to wake up that early on my vacation. Besides, those parkings do not have unlimitted access to your car and will charge every time you leave and then enter back again.

The room service was just OK and pretty overpriced for the quality. The location is very convenient, however we felt it was in an unsavory area. We wanted to be in the gaslamp area, which we were, but there were a lot of homeless people, and across the street from the GreyHound bus station (which was our view).

Although most of them are harmless, you still need to be alert. Another bad point is that the rooms are slightly older, as is the entire hotel. One other bad point is that I could hear the traffic (train and airplane) noise constantly, but that's probably true for all downtown hotels in San Diego, since the airport is so close by. I did use earplugs to sleep every night, as my neighbors were sometimes noisy. The TV was ok, but there were no movie channels (HBO, etc.). Good points are that the hotel staff are great. The front desk staff are very helpful and nice. The cleaning staff are also very polite. They never came before 10AM to start cleaning my room, so the mornings were quiet. There were free apples at the front desk, which were nice. The rooms were very clean and I was satisfied with that aspect of it. The lobby of the hotel is also very cute and comfortable.

The Brisol was $100.00 less per night than a room at the Westin would have been, and was less than 2 blocks from the Westin. My room was spotless, and well-maintained by the hotel staff. Desk staff were friendly and helpful overall. I was able to use a computer in the lobby (free of charge) to print up my airline ticket, and to check e-mail. There was an inroom safe, free of charge. The hotel is well-located (downtown); I did a lot of walking by myself in the area, including in the evening, and had no problems. San Diego's a big city, with its share of street people and other assorted characters, but I never felt unsafe walking from the hotel to the old train station (check it out; it's gorgeous), to Horton Plaza (2 blocks away), or to the Pier shopping area. Gaslamp District is very close also. An Airport Flyer bus stops less than a block from the hotel, at a cost of $2.25 (versus about $15.00 and a wild trip from the airport with an angry cab driver); I recommend taking the bus to/from the airport, if you can. I also recommend asking for a room below the 8th floor. The 9th floor is an uncarpeted ballroom. On two weekend nights when I was there (in my 8th floor room), there were events which could be heard through the ceiling (music, furniture being dragged across the floor), up to and after midnight. Quieted down about 1:00 a.m. Other than that, no problems with noise. Guest rooms are carpeted, so you should be okay on a lower floor. On the whole, I would definitely return to the Bristol. I like the hotel - it's a well-kept/updated older building, well-appointed and with interesting architecture. My room was very comfortable and oh-so-clean.

When we first checked in we informed the staff at the front desk that we were from San Diego, used to live in downtown, and that we were staying at the Bristol so we could be within walking distance to the Convention Center (where we would taking the CA Bar Exam for the following three days). The first night the hotel checked a party into our room at approxiamtely 10:30 p.m. We had gone to sleep at 9:00 p.m. seeing as though the Bar Exam was the most important test of our lives only to be woken up an hour and half later by people trying to enter the room. When we yelled to the people on the other side of the door that we were already checked into the room, the people decided to go get security to help them get into the room... and security attempted to help them! We told the security we were validly checked into the room and that we were trying to sleep, thinking that would solve the problem. However, again at midnight - people trying to get in. AGAIN at 1:30 in the morning - a whole family trying to get it! Finally we had it! I called down to the front desk demanding they stop checking different people into our room, explained my frustration that I needed sleep before the first day of the Bar Exam and could not get it because the hotel kept checking people into our room, and I was informed that I WAS NOT CHECKED IN AND NOT IN THE SYSTEM!! The guy at the desk said that he would make a note not to check anyone else in and that I would need to check in again in the morning or bring proof that I was checked in... AND I DID! In the morning, on the way to the first day of testing, I stopped by and showed proof that I had paid for the room for 3 nights at $149 a night, and they still had no record of us checking in! In the back of our minds throughout the day of testing we were wondering if people we checked into our room while we were gone and if our belongings were safe... During the remainder of our stay I stopped by the front desk asking for a manager to speak to about the situation and NO MANAGER SEEMED TO EVER BE AVAILABLE. Finally, when we were checking out a manager magically appeared.

The staff was both gracious and efficient, responding promptly to our request for help with the air conditioner. Daisies was a bit pricey for breakfast but the location lends itself to lots of options for restaurants within walking distance. We walked to Horton Plaza, Seaport Village and the ferry to Coronado. The bus to Balboa park was just one street over.

The beds were comfortable, the spacious room was decorated with a modern flair, and the in room wireless was a nice amenity.

It was just a few blocks from the Gaslamp Quarter, a huge Ralphs market, and the Horton Plaza. Our room was pretty tiny but it was furnished in a fun contemporary style and had a flat screen TV. The view was also great. We were facing out toward 1st street and could see the Bay in the distance. My only issue with this hotel was the beds. The mattresses were awful! I mean, really really bad. Not only were they cheap mattresses with no padding, but the ones in our room were clearly damaged. The moment we sat on them they sagged down to the floor. We asked for a new room the next day and were moved to the opposite side of the hotel. We lost our great view, but at least the mattresses weren't sagging to the floor.

It is an older hotel but you couldn't tell it by the updating they have put into. The lobby is small, but was still inviting and had a touch of elegance to it. The rooms were the typical size of a hotel room with the usual amenities. But you could tell they had recently remodeled them since the paint, rug, and decor was quite modern. The beds and bedding, while not quite up to the Westin's Heavenly Beds standards, came pretty close. They were very comfortable and we slept very well. Our room had no view as it faced the wall of the building across the street. That wasn't a big deal because we were only there the one night. It did become a problem was we forgot to pull the darkening shades across and the reflection from the building caused the room to be excessively bright. Once we pulled them, it was okay. Also our bathroom had his funky folding door that didn't really close all of the way. However, our children's room had a sliding door that worked fine. Overall, these were are only complaints. We found the Bristol to be very quiet, very clean, and very comfortable. We ate at their restaurant for breakfast and the food was good. We only had limited contact with the staff, but we found them friendly and helpful. We also liked how the valet service isn't on the street, but you make a right turn into a driveway.

Third, you can't get a good night's sleep because the bus station right across the street is going 24-7. Fourth, it is walking distance from the Gaslamp -- but only if you don't mind a hike through some sketchy areas at night (see #3 above re: the Greyhound bus station).", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cclean, hip hotel that could use better staff\u201d", "Author": "Corgimom", "ReviewID": "UR4694223", "Content": "We stayed at the Bristol March 15 - 17. The whole town was packed due to the convergence of NCAA, the Baseball Classic and two large conventions, not to mention the St. Patrick's Day festivities. We've stayed at this hotel before and were pleased to get a $149 rate since the town was almost booked up. This is a small boutique hotel not far from Horton Plaza Mall (four blocks) and the Gaslamp quarter (six blocks). It isn't in a scenic area but it is clean and safe. Yes, there is a Greyhound station next door and downtown tends to be noisy. This is a somewhat artsy hotel, with bright yellow paint in the halls that fades upwards to an orange. Paired with the blue carpet, is has a Warhol/Lichtenstein effect. Lots of pop art is the hallways completes the decor. It has a small bright lobby with overstuffed red and blue chairs. The rooms are large and have minimal art deco furniture with very comfortable beds. The windows open, which is rare in a hotel, but the city noise makes it an almost moot choice. The linens are bright red and orange. There are two robes in the closet and the bathroom is larger than average, with great water pressure and temperature. The toilets look brand new and somewhat \"gadgety\". I loved the soap and shampoo -a vanilla/almond scent. The bath has a pocket door with a small pull to use (just run your finger over it and it pops out), the door may be heavy but it easy to use once you get the hang of it - it saves lots of room in the bath. I thought it was weird that there was no safety latch on the door to the hallway, just a regular lock. Free Internet access was available in all rooms, and there is also a free computer in the lobby to use. The Daisy Cafe is small and the food just OK, nothing special, but good for a quick breakfast or lunch. The front desk staff could definitly use some customer service training - not very friendly or helpful, or even apologetic when they didn't have an answer. The phones seemed busy, so they may have been understaffed. All in all, it was a great deal since the Omni and Marriott were over $300 per night. The trolley stops at the corner and taxis to the airport are less than $10. It is a good fifteen minute walk to the convention center or Petco Park, but through a safe part of town.

There was zero privacy since the door to the bathroom was a flimsy sliding door on squeaky hinges with no lock. The water temp in the shower was nearly impossible to adjust. The bathtub was chipped and peeling. In the living area the decor was too bright and ugly (red and orange stripes, brown stripe curtains, etc.). The air conditioning control box must have been from about 1970 and was hard to regulate. The comforter had a crusty stain in the middle of it. As far as the noise level, it was really difficult to sleep due to the Greyhound Bus station across the street.

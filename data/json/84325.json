This is our second year at this hotel and the pool party is what brought us back again this year along with 2 more! Our rooms were ocean front, very clean and very comfortable beds. They all come equiped with a small fridg, microwave, safe, etc. The breakfast every day was great, eggs, biscuits and gravy, french toast sticks, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit salad, fresh fruit, yogart, 3 juices and 3 coffees. The staff is there re-filling everything often, you just can't go hungry! The Ocean is just steps from the outdoor pool, which is right out the back door next to the breakfast area. Warm cookies at night are to die for! Beach towels at the front desk. I agree with Ed J as they to make you feel like it is a family reunion! The beach is clean and the water was warm. Ice cream truck runs up and down the beach several times a day and you can also rent paddle boards, chairs and umbrellas from the truck set up just steps from the back stairs of the hotel.

Building looks good, bigger than i had thought. Upon check in the gentleman working the desk was extremely helpful. Gave us info on the BBQ/pool party, gave recommendations on where to go and eat, and lastly told us that cookies would be ready in about 10 minutes (you could smell them baking). We had a ocean view king room on the 4th floor (room 401). Room was clean, fresh, large and updated. Big tv, microwave, decent sized dorm fridge, balcony, etc. Hallways were all clean, presence of housekeeping is noticeable. Top points: The BBQ/Pool party- fantastic. We grabbed some chairs early just to catch some sun, no intentions of staying for the BBQ. Once the dj got there and the grill fired up we couldn't leave. They had people walking around with jello and pudding shots (both alcoholic and not for the kids). Burgers, hot dogs, beers, sodas, water etc. We met some great people there and everyone had a blast. Free breakfast- The breakfast was good. I would say a little better than your typical hotel breakfast.

What a difference this morning's scenery is from yesterday's. Yesterday morning, I was sitting out on my balcony at the Hampton Inn, watching the sun rise, and sipping fresh coffee I didn't have to make. This was my third time staying at the Hampton Inn-Daytona Shores. I am always impressed with how courteous and efficient the staff is. When I arrived this time, my room was toward the end of the hotel. I had a view of the beach but also the parking lot. I went down to see if they had a room overlooking the pool, and the gentleman, I don't recall his name, immediately and without complaint moved us actually to the room I had on my last visit, with a view of the ocean in front, and a view of the pool to the right. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and like you're home and part of the Hampton Inn family. I always look forward to seeing Rachel at the front desk for the first time on my visit, who remembers me from my previous visits and always cheerfully welcomes me back. Coffee is in abundance at this establishment. There is a coffee pot in the room, as well as a refrigerator and a microwave. But, we never even touched the coffee pot in the room, as there was always coffee in the lobby. One morning, I went to get coffee and as I filled my cup, one of the staff said, \"Put that down. I'm getting you fresh coffee.\" We slept in one morning and had a do not disturb sign on the door. Later, there was a message on the phone from the front desk, saying that the cleaning person noticed the do not disturb sign, and that if there was anything we needed, please let them know. I said we could use some fresh towels but we would pick them up the next time we passed the desk. Next thing I knew, there was a cleaning person at the door, with fresh towels. She also came in and tidied up a little for us. There are several eating establishments within walking distance, as well as a 7-11 across the street. The location is also convenient for traveling by bus. Adding to the convenience is the breakfast they serve. You don't have to go out and find a place that serves breakfast. You have your choice of cereals, eggs, sausage, etc. right there. Oh, yeah, and did I mention coffee? This week, they were down to one elevator at one point, only because they were putting in non-slip floors on both of the elevators. But work on both elevators was done in two days (one per day), and when I left, both were in use again. The Hampton Inn Daytona Shores has become my home away from home when I'm in Daytona.

Our bed slept well, and we had a great AC unit. We love sitting on our private balcony watching the ocean and beach activities. We enjoyed the warm cookies each evening and 24hr. coffee.

The location is about three miles south of the center of the beach area, so is in a quieter area. The lobby is 1970's spartan, and could use some refurbishing. Our beachfront room was comfortable, with a good bed, flat screen TV, etc. But the walls, fixtures and carpet showed their age (admittedly it's difficult to keep beach hotels in great shape). There were only a few people staying there the night we were there, so we didn't understand why we were given a room where you had to walk outside to get to your room (it was a very cold day for Daytona)---half of the beachfront rooms have interior access, and most of those were probably empty. The breakfast buffet was on par for Hampton Inns, and the front desk staff were generally friendly. Obvioulsly we didn't use the outdoor pool, but it didn't look like anything special.

The management and staff at the Hampton Inn do such a great job, I have to share our experience with anyone considering a beach front vacation in central Florida. We have had a family vacation in Daytona Beach Shores for the past three years. The first two years, we had eleven at the Hampton Inn. This year, we had thirteen ranging in age from four to seventy-five, and we were again at the Hampton Inn. It was another wonderful trip The Hotel: What sets this hotel apart from the rest is the management and staff. Sandy Ellis is the General Manager and has put together a great team. On any given day you can find her behind the front desk, in the breakfast area helping guests with the freshly made waffles or mingling with the crowd at the Saturday BBQ, karaoke pool party, which is complimentary by the way. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The entire staff does their best to make your stay enjoyable. This includes the front desk when you check in or when you are looking for the 7:30 p.m. freshly baked cookies. The housekeeping staff does a great job keeping your room and towels fresh during your stay. If you occasionally see them in the halls, don\u2019t be surprised if they ask \u201cHow is your stay?\u201d The same goes for the young man who neatens and sprays down the pool deck around 7:00 a.m. every morning. \u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d Each morning there is a large breakfast buffet served, which includes hot and cold options. This is a huge benefit for our group. We get a Dennny\u2019s / IHOP-type breakfast, at no additional cost, with no wait right at the hotel. The ladies that put this together are wonderful. The food is continuously replenished and the dining area and tables are kept clean. Breakfast starts at 6:00 a.m., which is great for me. And it is served until 10:00 a.m., which is great for my teenage kids. The Hampton Inn also offers a few unexpected niceties. Three years ago, during our first visit, we noticed a BBQ around the pool with a D.J. and karaoke. We then learned it was for all hotel guests and joined in on the fun. (Had we only read all the signs around the hotel and in the elevator earlier.) My youngest child was singing karaoke a short while later. This is truly a great time for kids and adults alike. This year we arrived at the hotel on a Saturday around 2:00 p.m. Our first stop after checking in was at the BBQ for grilled hotdogs, hamburgers and cheeseburgers. The Hampton Inn also collects beach chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards that past guest have left behind. These are not provided by the hotel and are offered on a first come, first served basis. Many guests, including us, purchase these items when they arrive for a beach vacation. They are often left behind when the guests leave. The Hampton Inn has two large bins on the pool deck where items left behind are collected. You can take a chair, umbrella or boogie board to use on the beach and then return it when you are done. Best advice is to get there early, because these are hot items. Then there are the freshly baked cookies at the front desk at 7:30 p.m. every evening. They are great. If you think this is just a trite gesture, your opinion will change when you see the kids and adults gathered at the front desk around 7:15, and then taste the cookies at 7:30. The Dining: There are many good restaurants within 10 minutes of the Hampton Inn. If you are looking for a recommendation, ask Sandy Ellis (G.M.). One night she suggested Our Deck Down Under. She told us who to ask for and said to tell the person that Sandy sent us. We were immediately seated, despite the long line and had a wonderful dinner. Other good restaurants within a few minutes are Boondocks on Peninsula Drive, Crabby Joe\u2019s on Sunglow Pier and Ocean Deck on A1A in Daytona Beach. A special favorite for our group is JB\u2019s Fish Camp in New Smyrna Beach just off of A1A (I think), but that is about 30 minutes from the hotel. Another great option for our group was eating dinner in the hotel. Publix grocery store is about a minute from the hotel by car. They have broasted chicken, sandwiches, fruit, salad, etc. On a few nights we all went our own directions, whether to the Publix or a restaurant, and returned to the hotel to eat together in the common area where breakfast is served. The Location: The Hampton Inn is directly on the beach. Downtown Daytona Beach is a 5 minute drive to the north. Ponce Inlet is a five minute drive to the south. The Orlando theme parks are a 75 minute drive southwest. One day, some of our group drove to the Orlando Disney parks in the morning and then returned to the Hampton Inn in time for an evening dip in the ocean. The beach is just steps from the hotel and is gorgeous. The beach is clean, level and has few rocks or shells, which makes it easy on the feet if you are walking without shoes. The beach also has a smooth transition into the water, which makes for a friendly entry into the ocean. This is great for kids in particular. The sun rises over the water and is a spectacular view, if you are up in time to see it. Also, the beach never felt crowded. It is approximately 500 feet wide and goes for miles to the north and to the south of the Hampton Inn. The Daytona International Speedway is about 15 minutes away. The castle in St. Augustine and the Canaveral National Seashore are within an hour. There is also deep sea fishing and golf within 15 minutes. The Bottom Line: This is a well managed, well maintained beachfront hotel with many complimentary perks for its guests. We highly recommend this hotel if you are considering a trip to this area.

This is unacceptable because it puts guests at substantial risk of identity theft and is a needless invasion of privacy. There are over 10 million cases of identity theft every year in this country, and most of it is committed by employees with access to sensitive personal information. A driver's license contains sensitive information such as date of birth, home address, and driver's license number, all of which can be used by hotel employees to commit identity theft or can be sold to others. It is a simple matter to look up a social security number using databases such as LexisNexis and Westlaw once a person has a name, date of birth, and DL number. DL numbers are routinely used in check fraud. Many websites resells this data. Moreoever, photocopies of identity documents can be used to open online bank accounts, request credit reports, change credit report information, and open credit card accounts. There is also no legitimate \"need\" for the hotel to have these photocopies. How long are they being stored for, under what security, and how is the hotel disposing of them?

After reading the reviews here, I didn't think twice about staying at this Hampton Inn. I reserved a King room oceanfront, preferably on a high floor. When I arrived and was told my room was on the 4th floor (actually 3 floors up), I asked if there was room available on a higher floor. The young man (I think his name was John, but I'm not sure, I checked in on Thursday, August 26th and checked out Sunday, August 29th), told me nothing was available. I asked if he was sure and he told me there is only one King room oceanfront per floor and the upper floors were already booked (I learned later that he was not telling the truth - there's at least one other King room oceanfront on each floor). Then, the other guy at the front desk whose name I did not get said that the hotel \"caters to families.\" Well, just shoot me for being single!!!! The purpose of my trip, which I realize they didn't know, was to get some \"me\" time following the demise of my marriage, so imagine being told by the hotel staff where you are going to relax and recover that the hotel caters to families. Of course, they did not know my heartache, but still!!!! Okay, after getting to my room which was a corner room (401), I found ants in the bathroom. After killing the 5th ant that I saw, thankfully, I did not see any more in the bathroom for the rest of my stay. I told the person at the front desk about the ants and he told me that the guy who does their monthly pest spraying was just leaving the hotel. Inspite of the insensitivity of the front desk staff and the ants, I managed to have a wonderful time. I LOVE the beach at Daytona Beach. I was determined to not let the front desk staff ruin my stay. The hotel turned out to be really nice. The location right on the beach was just what I had hoped for and needed.The breakfast was plentiful and filling. I did not go to the free Saturday meal at the pool because I stay away from hot dogs and burgers, but it looked like people were enjoying themselves. My King room was nice and large. It had a microwave and small refridgerator which was nice. Would I stay here, again? NO!!!!! I'd rather stay at a hotel that caters to ALL their guests whether they are single or with a family.

They also have complimentary popcicles for the kids, and on Saturday afternoons there is a pool-side cook-out and karioke with a DJ and some of the best burgers and hot dogs around, along with soft drinks for the kids and rum punch for the parents. Outstanding. The swimming pool is large, with a 3' shallow end and 5' deep end. No diving board or kiddie pool, but plenty of relaxation and fun for everyone. The hotel provides pool and beach toys, and folding beach chairs in storage lockers at the pool, just grab what you want and go play. Our kids (5 and 2) had as much fun at the pool as on the beach, and it's a great way to unwind after a day in the surf. There is also a small hot tub, but with the temperature in the 90s and the pool feeling like bath water already I couldn't imagine hopping into the hot tub. Maybe in November. The beach is just a few steps below the pool deck, down the stairs and you're on the beautiful white powder sand that Daytona is famous for. The hotel itself is not a new building, and from the front could easily be passed by as nothing special, but a closer look tells a different story. The design is \"L\" shaped, with most of the rooms ocean-front. The rest have an great ocean view to the left and a beautiful view of the Halifax river to the right. There is ample free parking on site and across the street. We never had to park across the street, but it's a short walk. The rooms are very nice, kept in good condition and very clean. Everything works, everything is comfortable. There is an in-room safe, free WiFi, a dorm-size refrigerator and microwave oven, which are wonderful for quick meals in the room when the kids are more ready for a nap than lunch. I could only find one negative to the room and that is the airconditioner, which is a wall unit, common to many hotels. The ones here are new and in good condition, but like all of their kind can be a bit loud. I usually set the fan to run at low speed on this type of A/C unit at night to make it easy to sleep, but these do not have that option, and cycle on and off. It didn't keep me from sleeping, but I'd have preferred a steady fan at night.

The most important things were there...a clean bathroom, wonderful Hilton style comfy beds and a balcony overlooking the beach and pool. We were also glad to see the larger sized mini-fridge which made room for some of our own goodies. They still have older TV's that work fine with no extra cost movie frills. Who wants to stay in the room and watch movies? There's free HBO so that should be fine for everyone. The Saturday party at the pool was fun and entertaining with free burgers, hot dogs and drinks. Later there was Karaoke, hula-hoop contest, JELL-O shots and watermelon. This pool party happens from Memorial Day to Labor Day. There is a free breakfast every morning with basic items although we ventured out for breakfast each day. There is free wireless internet which worked fine. There isn't really a 'business center' but there is a free computer you can use in the lobby area. Since there is no restaurant on site there is no room service which we very rarely use anyway. The only downsides to our stay was the coffee in our room. Not sure the brand but it was pretty awful so I went downstairs and got us coffee. Also, the elevators are pretty slow so don't be in a hurry to go up or down. Both are very minor criticisms. We received a free newspaper every day and there is fruit and fresh cookies in the lobby on ocassion. We would definitely come back here in a heart beat!", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cLoved It, will be back\u201d", "Author": "PlayHard05", "ReviewID": "UR72402968", "Content": "The hotel experience was wonderful.

The manager (Donna) and her staff are fantastic. I had a conference in Daytona, this hotel was less than 10 minutes from the Hilton, great free breakfast, free parking, free wireless, great cable with HBO, pool overlooking the ocean. Other hotels charge extra for most of these amenities. Oh, and Donna knew I was working late and asked me what kind of cookies they should set aside for me. Can you imagine? How nice is that. The hotel was extremely clean and my Ocean front room had a walk out balcony with table and chairs for a price much less than hotels in Dayton. In fact many of those hotels don't even have a balcony. And, if you are in the area for work or don't want to listen to motorcycles cruising the loop in Daytona, this place is very quite with the exception of the ocean. I left my private balcony door open all night. If you stay above the 5th or 6th floor, people on the beach can't hardly see into the room. Day one I was in a crunch to get materials for a conference. They gave me direction to a copy location and gave me a coupon for the place too-Amazing. The second day they were power washing, waxing, and vacuuming the lobby floors and elevators. Day three there was a guy scrubbing the brass railings. I've stayed at Hotels all over the states and if you are like me and don't care about a fancy lobby and just want good service, clean rooms, decent price, and great extras this hotel is it. Not to mention you are right on the beach. Sun came up in my room every morning. Stop looking at book it. Thanks Donna! P.S.

After that (and 15 minutes of waiting), it was no surprise that the front desk clerk was no friendlier when I checked in either. A couple of hours later when I turned my television on, the channels were so fuzzy I could not see anything. I called the front desk to ask about it and he said maintenance was right there and would send him right up. 30 minutes later, maintenance finally arrived. To make a long story short, I had to keep wiggling the cable in the back of the television until the channel was clear again. The internet connection was pretty slow - bordering on dial up speeds. When I left the next morning, I said good-bye to the front desk clerk who responded with nothing.

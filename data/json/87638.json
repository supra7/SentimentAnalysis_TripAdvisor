The yet to be completed renovations cannot be finished soon enough. If you're sensitive to mold, then do yourself a favour and check your bathroom carefully for mold upon entering your guestroom for the first time. The first guestroom that I was put in had a bad black mold problem in addition to it being in a state of disrepair. The guestroom to which I was subsequently moved also had a mold issue and was similarly less than ideal, but I was too busy to move again. I did let a woman on the reception desk know about the second mold problem upon check out, however. It seems likely that renovated guestrooms are handed out only by special request and even then they are necessarily subject to availability unless you've got some kind of status with Sheraton or you've paid a top rate. Both of the rooms that I saw were dated and a bit tatty. Cleanliness also seems to be a problem. I found a few glaring cleanliness issues during my stay at the hotel, but I discussed only three of them with hotel associates. How hair finds itself smeared on to a bathroom ceiling is beyond me! It could have gotten there by the hand of a guest as easily as it did a dirty housekeeping or maintenance rag, but the point is that it shouldn't be on the ceiling at all. Look, I know that it has to be very difficult to keep guestrooms clean and I take care to leave a couple of bucks for housekeeping cleaners every day, but hair on the ceiling? In my many decades of travelling, that's a first for me. It was a bit of a shock in a hotel of this calibre. If you'll be driving a great deal while in Chicago, then please do know that as of the date of this review and unless otherwise indicated on the meter pay station or by signs posted in the neighbourhood, you can park on the street for free around the hotel from 9:00 p.m. at night until 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For those arriving late and leaving early throughout their stay, this can amount to a significant savings. Empty your car of any valuables and provided it isn't a fancier late model vehicle, it should be safe enough on the streets of Streeterville over night. Street parking is available on the ramp descending from reception or on the streets below the elevated reception level of the hotel, which streets can be accessed from the reception level by a set of stairs at the end of East North Water Street. Parking in this manner saved me anywhere from $60 to $110 during my stay.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay to see the sights!\u201d", "Author": "DavidAuburn", "ReviewID": "UR126251576", "Content": "This hotel is on the River, so it is in a great location to see the sights North and South of the River.

The room itself was clean. The view was great. It wasn't one of the newly renovated rooms. It could definitly use some updating in the bathroom. It was rusting on the vents and shower bars. It was clean though and the showerhead was nice and strong. There is a wonderful riverwalk behind the hotel and sine the weather was beautiful for a March night in Chicago, we strolled. I recommend you do it also. The staff we encountered was very pleasant. We didn't eat there as the food was way overpriced. The beds were very comfortable. The only issue I had was the bed skirt is bright white, and it was stained and dirty and looked horribly gross. We did find a wonderful little restaurant after walking a mile or so.

We stayed 3 nights, and this was a preferred hotel for the event we were attending. The rooms are ok, not a 4 star. Here is why I was disappointed: 1. We requested and paid for a roll-away bed, and it took several phone calls to have it delivered 2. There was a half empty small bottle of wine in our mini-fridge, obviously sampled by a previous guest. We needed an extra key, so went to the front desk to get the key and tell them about the wine, so it would not be charged to our room. There was a HUGE line at the desk for checking in, with 3 people working. 2 guests of our room, including myself are Starwood Preferred members. So we went to the separate SPG line, which no one else was in at the time. This separate line clearly did not matter. The desk people were taking forever with each person they helped, and would motion for the next guest in the regular line to come forward, completely ignoring us. We waited in the line almost an HOUR, of course trying to get to the desk but being trumped by someone else they would call up. When we finally got to the desk, the attendant seemed very irritated. I kindly explained about the wine, he said he would take care of it. When our final bill came the next morning, there was a $23 charge for the wine. So we still had to call down and have it removed from our bill, fully realizing we had wasted an hour for nothing. 3. The doormen were continuously standing around, never once opening a door for us, even when we were clearly struggling with multiple bags. 4. When we checked out, we had tons of bags to load in the car. I had self parked, so pulled off to the side in the small circle drive, and a doorman if it was ok to park there while we loaded, as there was no signage at all. He was quite rude, didn't say yes or no, only \"give me your keys\". really?? I should also mention, we booked this room through the spg site, not a 3rd party, and are SPG members.

The valet option did have in-out privileges, so we chose that option, but it cost $51.00 per day. A total of $102.00 to park our car for two days at the hotel. The valet doesn't even bring the car to the front door, you have to go down to the basement to pick up your car. The parking charge was 1/3 the cost of our room which we were not happy about, nor do they tell you that when you book your room. Secondly, being the weekend before Valentine's, my husband thought it would be a special surprise to have flowers in our room. He called the hotel a few days before our arrival and spoke to the concierge who assured him they could take care of that. He was referred to Randolph florist, who also said, they do that all the time. Well upon our arrival, no flowers in the room, spoiling the surprise my husband had planned. The hotel did have the flowers, they offered no apologies or explanation as to what happened with the flower delivery. Thirdly, the hotel offers free wi-fi in the rooms, but we had difficulty on my laptop of getting a signal strong enough to use the wi-fi. We sure were disappointed and upon expressing our disappointment were referred by the concierge to log our feedback on tripadvisor.com. Fourthly, we were attending the Auto Show and the hotel advertised a free shuttle to the convention center. The hours of the shuttle were 8am - 11am and then from 7:30pm - 10pm. These times were not advertised anywhere on the hotel web site, only that there was a free shuttle. Some other travelers waited over 75 minutes for the shuttle, that was supposed to run every 1/2 hour.

For many years I worked about 3 blocks away, and I wanted to see how much the area had changed/grown since we moved out of the city. Well, things have changed - more condos, new restaurants. Walking around the block, up and down Ohio St, St.Clair and the \"She Streets\" - Superior, Huron and Erie - was fun. Lots of interesting places. I remember when this hotel was being built, years ago back in the early '90's. It was quite a spectacular sight back then. It still is! But the time has come for some \"freshening up.\" And I do understand that a complete room renovation will be done by 2014. That's great! And that's why I give the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers a solid 3.75 stars - for now. (It gets a 4-star on the TripAdvisor rating scale.) Here are a few highlights of our stay: We checked-in on Saturday, a little after 3pm, and were warmly greeted by Olga at the front desk. (Nice job representing Sheraton, Olga!) As requested, we got a King Room on a higher floor. Room 1150. It faces north, so I got a good city view, looking down toward my old office building on Ohio St. Things that we noted: the building is still impressive; the lobby is beautiful; the Java Bar is still a \"warm classy\" place to have a drink and share some conversation; fantastic river view, looking south; Shula's Steak House, right there off the lobby. All really nice. (Note: since we know our way around, the hotel simply served as a one-night \"home base,\" so I don't have anything else to offer about the other hotel features or services.) Now for some room detail: The room was very clean. But it is dated. The carpeting and wall paper - which carries over from the hallway - brought back memories of my 86 year-old mother's harvest gold-color refrigerator, which she got rid of 25 years ago. That refrigerator would have nicely matched the color scheme in this room. The furniture did appear to be newer. And the bed was fantastic. Very comfortable. There was also a nice LG flat-screen HD TV which, I would guess, was about 30 - 32\". It was placed on top of the mini bar cabinet. When we walked in, the room was warm. There are 2 heaters in this room. Both were on. (It was in the low-40's outside.) We turned both of the heaters off. The room stayed warm all night. The bathroom was clean and tidy. However, there were only 2 bath towels. We could have used another. (Note: when we initially turned on the bathroom light, the bath fan automatically went on, as it should. However, later in the evening, a very loud and annoying buzzing sound was coming from the fan. Later, the fan didn't come on at all. So, if you don't already know, Sheraton Management, you need to repair/replace the bath fan in 1150.) The only other thing to mention here is that the internet access is $12.95/day in the room/hotel. So, as noted above, given our limited stay, if room 1150 is a good representation of the majority of rooms currently available: you can expect a very clean, well-maintained room that needs to be updated. Still nice. But, it's not a 4 or 5 star room. And that makes this hotel a 4-star hotel, at best, right now. You seasoned travelers will understand this. However, it's still a very nice hotel, given the location, service and other amenities. Just one more thing that surprised me about my old work neighborhood: when we were up in the room, looking down at the street, I noticed a Dominick's Grocery Store a couple blocks away. I though that it would probably be the typical, small city grocery store. So, on the way back to the hotel before dinner, after having a couple drinks at Timothy O'Toole's, a local watering hole, we stopped in to check out the Dominick's. What a surprise! This store is HUGE! And it has absolutely anything and everything that you could ever want from a grocery - it was amazing for a downtown location. So . . . When all you Packers fans come to Chicago to beat the Bears, book a room at the convenient-to-Soldier Field-Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Then hightail it over to the Dominick's to load-up on your beer and the brats from the vast selection in their deli. You're sure to have a good time. And you can probably buy a portable grill there, too.

We initially had a bit of trouble finding the hotel and none of the locals seemed to know where the hotel was or if it even existed. Nevertheless, we did end up finding it. We arrived early and had to store our luggage. I tipped the guy who stored the luggage but didn't tip the bellman when I picked it up and he kind of game me a \"pffffff\", which I found pretty unprofessional. The hotel was excellent. It has a great location downtown Chicago and walking distance to many of the places we visited. We had a very nice, clean, spacious room. We had to use the concierge several times for assistance and the lady who served us was outstanding. Can't remember her name but she was an older lady who has worked there several years. She is a gem for this hotel. On a side note, you must try Smoque restaurant. We had to take the subway to get there but it was well worth the trip. Without a doubt the best ribs I have had in my life. We stayed on the Starwood Preferred level and the lounge on that floor is amazing. It has a great view of Chicago and very good snacks in the morning and evening. When we checked out, we had to store luggage again. Again, I tipped one bellman but the one who put one of the bags in the cab didn't get a tip and he slammed the door of the cab so hard he almost took off my leg. The cab driver even turned around and gave the bellman a \"What the f?\" stare. Pretty unbelievable. I wasn't too happy with these bellman almost sticking their hands out to you everytime you came within two feet of them.

After checking reviews on Trip Advisor (ALWAYS do this first!), we booked our room directly with the Sheraton by phone. It was the \"show\" hotel, so we were given the \"show\" rate at booking. (a free shuttle provided by the Show was provided for show attendees also... thank you Strictly Sail!) We were glad that the hotel (Located in the \"Streeterville\" area, and across the street and south of the NBC building,) was close to the Navy Pier, as well as the restaurants and shopping there downtown. Weather permitting, everything was within walking distance. Upon arrival: We were greeted by a helpful doorman, a beautiful, comfortable lobby, and (with no wait whatsoever) then Isaiah Jones at the reception desk. He was very friendly and helpful, as were the 3 other receptionists we saw there. Isaiah helped find us the best room, even one he would \"put his Mom in\", facing to the SW over the Chicago River. We were delighted with our room! It was clean and well appointed. The washcloths were missing, however, and a quick call to Darius produced some new washcloths in just a few minutes. After stowing our luggage in the big closet, and freshening up in the spotless bathroom, we watched the sun set through the \"canyon\" of glass and steel buildings, then headed off to dinner with friends. Bedtime: The King size bed was a slice of heaven, so comfortable! There were 4 pillows to choose from, and a light down coverlet and comforter to keep warm under. The wall heating unit was quiet, and didn't seem to kick in and out all night like some do. We slept with the curtains open, looking out over the city lights, and the rim of the lake. For a couple of small town folks, this was pretty darn magical! Staff: Everyone was friendly and helpful, even directing to nearby restaurants. Caution: Minibar and snack tray supplies are on an automatic scale, and checked daily. Inspect your bill for charges prior to check out. (We were charged for a bottle of wine we didn't drink) Misc: The passive vent in the bathroom worked quite well to exhaust steam and odors. (no exhaust fan) The minifrig was fully stocked, leaving NO ROOM for anything we might want chilled. There was free ice just down the hall, however, and an ice bucket. The coffee maker was of the \"pod\" type, featuring Starbucks \"Kitaamu\" (fabulous) coffee. There was tea, also, but no way to heat any water. (Microwave?) Internet WIFI was available for 12.50/day, but we just used our iPhones. Taxis waiting in front of hotel ($10 to the Shedd Aquarium, and $10 from Shedd to Union Station) and bus stop across the corner made easy transportation to areas beyond walking distance.

More importantly, the room was spotlessly clean, quiet, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The only downside was the fact that the internet connection (the room offered both wired and wifi) was NOT free (it cost about 13$ per 24 hour period) and even with the wired connection the speed of the internet was rather mediocre. If I pay for internet, it should at least be very fast. However, more important than the room itself, was the staff. Now, normally in these big chain hotels, I neither expect nor have many interactions with the staff, and I generally expect them to be very \"by-the-book\" - polite, but not flexible. The staff at this hotel really went above and beyond to be both friendly and helpful. One example of this is the fact that I arrived in the hotel for a very very large conference, and the hotel was full to capacity. I arrived in the morning, hours before the normal check-in time, and I was not alone. There were quite a few of us. The courteous and professional front-desk assistant apologized that the room was not ready yet, but said they were working as quickly as possible to get the rooms ready for early check-ins, and took my phone number to call me when the room was ready. I did not expect to hear for several hours, but within 20 minutes my phone rang, and five minutes after that I was safely ensconced in my room.

On the other hand, the gentleman who worked in the club lounge in the mornings was friendly, professional and hardworking. He managed to keep the area clean and food replenished at all times. He also put the beverages in the beverage fridge so we could help ourselves (as it should be!). Another gripe with the Club Lounge is that for our entire stay neither computer in the lounge worked.

Was promptly told by the operator that I was booked in a king room and there was nothing they could do since the hotel was sold out. Ok fine, I know sometimes that happens with priceline.... However, when I went to check in, I inquired again about the two double beds and the girl at the desk said there were several rooms with doubles available and even asked what floor I preferred. Made me feel like the first person I talked to didn't even bother to check. We had a room on the 17th floor. It wasn't a river view room, but the view was ok nonetheless. What I did notice immediately was that the room looked very outdated and a bit dingy. The window treatments and wallpaper were particularly in need of an update. The bed and bed linens were nice though. Very clean, and they were all white, including the comforter, so that's a plus. The beds were also quite comfortable. Once we got settled, we ordered brownie sundaes from room service. They arrived promptly, but the brownies were stale tasting and there was hardly any ice cream with them. For $40 for 3 sundaes, I would've expected something delicious. The hotel also does have a large fitness center and a pool, which we didn't utilize, but I'm sure my kids would have loved it if we had the time, and many downtown Chicago hotels don't have pools. Overall, our stay here was nice. The location was excellent and very convenient to Michigan ave shopping and navy pier. The hotel was listed by priceline as a 4 star, which puts it in the category with the Four Seasons and the Ritz.... I would give it more like 2.5 stars in comparison to those properties. The accomodations were adequate for the purpose of our trip, but if you're looking for something upscale, this isn't the best choice.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bartlett, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCommendation for employee Brian Scruggs\u201d", "Author": "Samuell194040", "ReviewID": "UR121869266", "Content": "We have just returned home for a wonderful weekend at Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers.

The shuttle to Macy's was great.....Luis, the driver was very accomodating. He even provided his cell number when we needed to be picked up. Bedding is very nice and the lobby area is beautiful. Now for the cons: #1. Upon checking in our reservation was mishandled. We made a reservation for one room, 2 beds on the club level. When we checked in, the only room available was with a King bed or they could give us a double, then switch rooms the following night. No way!!! We took a room on the 30th floor (floors 33 and 34 are club level), but still had club access. #2. Rooms are outdated, tile in bathroom is dirty and cracked. #3. The club level was one of the poorest I have been in to. Renae that works there in the evening is great however! Club level access was oversold, leading to a long line for breakfast...a Hampton/Holiday Inn breakfast is better. Not enough tables, not cleaned enough, fingerprints and grime on the glass door. Towards the end of our \"breakfast\" a card was placed at our table for us to fill out with our names, room number and # of guests. The card said that 3rd and 4th guests are an additional charge. But we paid for 3 people to stay in our \"club level\" room. Also, alcoholic beverages were an additional charge...most other club lounges (Ritz Carlton) provide them complimentary. #4. When we returned to our room Saturday evening at 6PM to prepare for our dinner reservation, we found that housekeeping had not cleaned our room. We called and housekeeper came to clean our room, but it was very inconvenient. Hard to relax with someone running the vacum around you! #5. When my husband went to the front desk to explain our dismay, the manager accused my husband of lying to him. I will avoid boring you with all of the details, but they ended up giving us a credit of a whopping $75-but we were checking out the next morning and were forced to use it on overpriced, gift shop crap. Overall, I definately would not recommned this hotel. Service is horrible (except for Renae on the club level and Luis running the shuttle).

We even noticed a difference when we had a different lady-though not bad, but the attention to detail. I actually witnessed our lovely assistant singing as she worked in another room. She really seemed to enjoy her work and what a wonderful sight. At the end of the conference on Sunday we were able to freshen up and take in the sights. We went to the Concierge for suggestions and once again-Demetrius was there to help us plan for the next two days as we were not leaving only Monday evening. His suggestions and scheduling for our experiences were well timed and perfect for level of adventure. You have a great staff in general but I would say even at checkout on Sunday night as we had to creat an expense account for our College and put the rooms on our travel card-everything was well done! I thank you for such a wonderful treat as I was a stranger to Chicago, but made to feel welcome and directed so nicely at every juncture. It seems customer service is important to you as an organization as it is to me as I grew up in retail and then have been a nurse for 28 years.

This time, though, the conference organizers were spot on when they chose the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Not only is it set up perfectly for conferences but its personal service for guests is great, too! Check-in: I was fearful at first when I walked into the lobby and saw a long line of at least 20 people/small groups ahead of me. I glanced at my watch wondering how long it would take to actually see my room. Imagine my surprise when ten minutes later I was in the elevator with room key in hand. The hotel management was clever enough to have plenty of check-in staff on hand for the conference, and check-in was quick, efficient, and friendly. I didn't feel rushed at all, yet they handled everything professionally and quickly and got me on my way. Kudos for that! The room: I booked a club room (top 2 floors) that have some special amenities--including access to the club lounge (continental breakfast in the morning, access to bottled water/soda throughout the day; snacks in the evening). The room is at the very end of a hall--configured a bit weirdly--it's a king size bed (my request) and as a corner room, there are some weird angles. Perfectly functional however. Everything was clean, in its place. The AC/Heat controls work well--which is great because I've been able to switch between warm/cool based on how I feel. (It's so annoying to get into a room and realize that the AC or Heat doesn't work properly. Not a problem here, though!) The bed is comfortable. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. Staff: I haven't really needed anything as everything has been perfect. The staff I've passed in the hallway and seen in the elevators have been friendly and personable. I have little doubt that they'd be able to help me out with anything if I asked for help. To me, one of the signs of a great hotel is that I don't need to ask for anything--because everything works properly, the room is clean, and I have everything I need is provided. Fitness Center: Good selection of cardio equipment, free weights, and some machines. A bit cramped--had to move over a few times when working with free weights because there wasn't enough space for 2-3 people to work out in the area at the same time. However, totally usable gym. Internet access: Excellent. Started right up quickly with strong wi-fi signal. Cost is $12.95 for 24 hours (fee is waived on club level). What one thing would I change? The in-closet safe is too small for a laptop computer. Great size for putting away a wallet or credit cards or passport/important papers, but not large enough to hold my MacBook. Recently I stayed at a hotel (W in Midtown Atlanta) that had a safe in the closet that not only was large enough for my laptop and phone, but even had an electrical outlet inside the safe so that you could plug in chargers and charge up devices while out of the room.

I have good memories from prior stays. All of that changed the minute I stepped into the hotel for this stay. I came in for a spine conference at Mc Cormick Place, and this hotel was one of the 'preferred providers' to choose from. My check-in took almost an hour! The girl at the desk asked me for payment for all 4 nights. I informed her that my company had made arrangements with the hotel ahead of time to use their credit card for everything, including incidentals (My office mgr is very anal about these things and she had even called earlier in the day and was told everything was fine). I explained to the girl that my company had made arrangements for me (and I should add that 1 night had been paid for up front as a deposit when making my reservation). Of course there was nothing notated on my reservation! I asked her to go and check for a fax or other communication. When she returned, I was told no, nothing found. A night manager then came over, and he informed me nothing could be done for me, and I would have to pay for my stay. I then pointed out that 1 night was already paid for, and that I would give them my Chas debit card for the 100.00 incidentals, and we would straighten everything out in the morning. There were several people waiting in line to check in and overheard everything. It was very humiliating to say the least. The next morning around 5:30a.m., I looked at my phone and saw a text message from my bank stating that my account was overdrawn! I logged onto my acct. and discovered that the Hotel had charged my card for the ENTIRE stay, and incidentals, so over 900.00 had been taken from me! I contacted my office manager as I was in panic mode, and she was livid. She confirmed she had spent alot of time making sure everything was set for my stay. She contacted the hotel and spoke with the front desk manager, and she couldn't understand or explain what had happened. After alot of prompting from my office, the hotel contacted my bank and asked them to remove the charges asap so I would have access to my money! For my troubles, I was awarded 10,000 spg points (big deal!). My room was dirty, and outdated. It is past time to renovate the rooms at this hotel! Very outdated bathrooms with old, dirty tile; hair in the bathtub, and the tub itself was chipped and stained. The room was dusty, the phone hadn't been cleaned in a very long time (eww!), the drawers were filthy and had several unidentified things in them; the curtains were missing hooks and hanging down; the air conditioner did not work properly and we sweated our first night. Also absolutely no place to plug in your computer or phone charger! A big pet peeve of mine! We asked for a mini fridge to put our water in and were charged 25.00 for that luxury. The internet is 12.95 a day, and is very very slow. Don't waste your money on room service. The food is terrible, and each time it came up ice cold, or items were missing that were ordered and charged for. Almost 80.00 for breakfast for 2 people?! Seriously?!! The 2nd morning I woke up to find that ONCE AGAIN, my card had been charged for the entire stay, and my account was again overdrawn! I called my office and they noted that the charge on their American Express card had been reversed! Here we go again!!! I call the front desk manager, and she tells me it is my bank's fault and there is nothing she can do! It was all I could do to not go downstairs in person and have an epic meltdown at that desk! My office called and also got nowhere quick. We ended up contacting Sheraton's corporate office to get someone to help us. I am so disappointed, pissed off, fed up, and worn out over this! I will NEVER give this hotel a penny of my business again! I am also planning on letting the head of the conference know my experiences, as well as everyone I know!

You hardly ever see that anywhere these days and a lot of hotel operators don't seem to understand how far that goes and the impression it makes on a guest. This was the last stop for me on a trip through the Midwest and most of the other hotels I stayed at it was hard to even get most of the staff to acknowledge your existence. Spot On Sheraton Chicago.

So going to/from airport on train or a Cub game or anywhere outside the city isn't as convenient. A never ending line of cabs is available 24/7 though and can take you anywhere, just at a higher price than public transport. The hotel bar was nice and you never drink alone with so many people there for the conventions. A Shula's Steakhouse is located in the lobby but with all the good food choices in Chicago we were never tempted to go there. We stayed on the 30th floor which is for SPG members only. Views were beautiful looking down the river and at the new Trump Tower. The rooms were very basic and clean with no frills. Bathroom was dated and had no flare. Carpets were clean. Beds and pillows were to my liking, but they have a weird plastic like middle sheet that was somewhat uncomfortable.

The public spaces are great - well laid out, well decorated, well set up. Restaurants (Shula's, Chi-bar) had good food and very good service; ditto the banqueting services. Simultaneous large (200+ people) meetings seemed to run smoothly. An oddity was the absence of a lobby kiosk for printing boarding passes - one had to go downstairs to a cyber cafe, log into a computer as a guest (an option not apparent unless you were told in advance) and go from there. So why not 4 stars for this aging Sheraton? The room experience was a different story, almost like something out of a bad comedy film. I was on the 34th (top) floor with a killer view but getting and being there was fraught with challenges. Checking in at 7:00 p.m. on a weekday, there were 6 people in line and only a single staffer at Reception. Eventually, two other people appeared wearing \"Trainee\" badges but they had to double-team their work and their inexperience showed - is it unusual for a Chicago hotel to get people checking in at 7 o'clock in the evening? Got upstairs and the room key would not work initially; that cleared but it still wouldn't open the lounge door. The front desk couldn't get the lounge attendant to answer the phone and open the door from inside, so they sent up a bellman with new keys that worked. Once in the room, the closet door required being held open (weighted and angled so it closed immediately unless held open) and the closet was unlit - other colleagues confirmed this was not unique to my room. Ever try to get dressed/undressed while holding the door open with one elbow or your head or your butt? Annoying! The desk drawer stayed open about 2 inches, because the desk was tilted forward and the drawer would not stay shut. Funny to see but not so funny when it came to using the desk. No electrical outlets visible anywhere in the room except the one on the desk that didn't work, and the one down behind the nightstand (accessible after moving the furniture) was full. Ordered room service which arrived promptly, but the rolling table was tilted in two directions - the soup had trouble staying in the bowl (but it was tasty!) and there was no way to fix the wobble when pressing down to cut with the knife vs. lifting the fork from the plate. The bathroom was designed back when no one in America was taller than 5'10\" (I am 6'4\"), so the shower came to my chest and the top of the mirror to my eyebrows. Using the hair dryer meant going out into the other room. Like I said, this could all have seemed like a bad comic film but I was there for long business days and just wanted a room that \"worked\" to sleep, bathe, and dress - maybe management should try spending a night in their hotel in order to notice these \"little\" things? I've had better experiences in other Chicago hotels that are similarly well located near Michigan Ave. and the River, so will probably not be back to the Sheraton Towers soon.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denton, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery good staff: Helpful, friendly, always trying to contribute to a good stay.\u201d", "Author": "Triaero", "ReviewID": "UR118150919", "Content": "The Sheraton Hotel and Towers is rather typical of a large downtown hotel.

One more tip: I often take a cab from O'Hare but the fare has now gotte up to over $60. I took a shuttle from ORD and too ORD on this trip. It was easy, we only stopped at one other hotel and the fare was only $29.

In addition, before I arrived another person from our group had reserved one of the rooms, but it appeared they gave us a fourth room that we were not supposed to have (This was in part our fault, but the checkin desk employee was not very clear on what was happening). The next morning we were able to sort out the room situation, and all seemed to be well. As it happened, I paid for one room the first night and was told that reservation was closed out, and my card would not be charged further. About a week later, I saw the correct charge for the one night on my card, but then the next day I received another charge. I contacted the hotel thinking it was just a mistake, but I was told no, that was a legitimate charge. I had a receipt showing the room was paid and that it was only a one night reservation. It took over 2 hours and 3 calls to get the issue sorted out, and it was only when I pointed out to the accounting manager that it was an unauthorized charge and that they did not have a signature from me authorizing the charge that they changed their tune. As for the hotel, it is very large but quite nice. It is located just north of the Loop close to Lake Michigan. It was the weekend of Lollapalooza and the hotel was totally sold out, which contributed to the issue with getting the proper room type (this was fixed on the second night).

First off, i'd say it is a so-so sheraton as far as sheratons are concerned. I've stayed in nicer sheratons, and I've stayed in worse. This one is a huge convention center hotel, and is a little older, and so it's a little worn down. The bathrooms for example look a little older and show a little dirt in the edges of the floor and shower tiles etc., but other than that everything was clean and acceptable enough, so that's all I care about there. Some of the other negatives were that the phone by the bed didn't work, nor did the mini-fridge (all the beverages inside were practically room temperature). Also, the first morning I spilled a little bit of coffee in bed, which left a little bit of a stain on the pillow case. They evidently don't routinely change the pillow cases, because i had that same stained pillowcase with me the next two nights. (though I was very willing to overlook this because, frankly, having free coffee/coffee makers in each room is invaluable to me!) Also, once or twice we had a little bit of a line waiting for elevator, as like I said, this is a big convention hotel which can pack in a lot of people. I didn't eat at their restaurants, but have heard they are pricey. (I can't confirm that, but can confirm a rail gin and tonic will run you $11 at the hotel bar! yikes! But that's not a big deal for me, because you don't come to chicago to eat at a hotel restaurant or drink at a hotel bar - there's too much going on elsewhere in the city, and so shame on you anyway for not getting out and finding something better anyway.) The biggest negative for me personally was that the hotel is a bit further from the El line than I initially thought it was, looking at the map. It was a full 20+ minute walk to get to the El Red Line, and even further to get to the Blue line (which you need going to and from O'Hare.) This obviously isn't a big deal, but it means you have to budget your time accordingly or take a cab each time you want to use the El. On the upside, this Sheraton had a number of good things going for it too. We had a really great view from our hotel room - we were on the 21st floor and could see both the lake to the left and the river cutting through the city to the right. They also have a great outdoor lounge area/deck on the 7th floor and a nice indoor pool and health club right there too. The hotel is also centrally located, right between the Loop and River North, and so while I would prefer a similar location on the river closer to the El, this is probably the next best thing, since you could walk over to the Navy Pier in less than 30 minutes, or across the river into the Loop in less than 30 minutes, or up to Streeterville or the Mag Mile in less than 30 minutes, etc. Plus you never have to wait for a cab, everytime we just walked out the hotel frontdoor and was able to jump immediately inside a waiting cab. Also, the staff was great. The concierge desk was very helpful, and the bell hops were the best, going above and beyond the call of duty (even helping to get a food delivery order up to our room when we weren't able to be there in time to meet the driver) - the whole staff was great.

For some reason, even the most solid of hotel brands just seem to drop the ball when it comes to Chicago. The hilton (overlooking grant park, is less a hotel and more an oversized shabby motel, and let;s not get started on the Hard Rock). But enough about them, onto the Sheraton! Located just a few block for Chicago's shopping mecca (the Magnificent Mile) on one side and Navy Pier and dthe lake on the other, this is a nicely located property. Add to that, the the property is on a small 'dead end' road (only used to access the hotel), it's also wonderfully quiet for a city centre property. That said, for a 4 star property, it's let down by some very dated design and an odd layout (with such hard to find signage, that you're always asking for directions). The Good: - the bed was decent, both in size and firmness. - The room was a very decent size and appropriately appointed (hooray, an iron and ironing board in the closet, desk, louge chair etc.) - The food was pretty good too. it was average 'bistro' fair, burgers, steaks, pasta etc. but tasted good and well presented. - interactive touchscreen tables in the lobby where you can play computerised games of chess or draughts (checkers). Great fun. The Not So Good - The hotel Lobby was unusually dark and looked rather dated - The bathroom could have come from any motel; it was functional but no 'design' had gone in to making it comfortable or welcoming - 70' marble effect counter tops, brown tiling, lino flooring; felt rather shabby - although the bedroom was appropriately appointed and had a comfotable bed, it was not an inviting room and looked like you'd stepped back into the 70s (sorry, I keep harking on about the dated quality of the hotel) - No Wifi in the hotel rooms, thought there was ethernet connectivity (useless if, like me, you now rely on an iPad when travelling) - Free Wifi in the lobby areas was great, except the signal was only strong on the floors below (coffee shop) and above (conference centre); so sitting in the lobby, you had to really struggle to get a connection. - Signage was poor; there's a lovely coffee shop on the floor below the lobby, a great burger restaurant on the floor below that a nice little 'hotel shop', oddly located in the entrance to the 'conference' area etc. Some nice concessions, but you'd be hard pushed to realise this stuff was there. Summary This is by no means a bad hotel, but for a 4-star property in a major US city, it really needs to lift itself up.

When I booked our room, I booked a double for my husband, myself and our two teenage children on the club level. We booked a room with a river or lake view and it stated this on the confirmation as well as the fact that there were four people. When we checked in they did not have a room with two doubles, only a king, so now my very tall teenagers were to be on rollouts. OK......we will deal with this. Then we check into the room and there is no view at all except for the top of the building next to us. When my husband went down to change rooms, Dave, the front desk manager told us \"we have nothing else, that is the only room available for you.\" When my husband further explained that we had a confirmed reservation he stated, \"sir, I have 25 other people in the same situation.\" No apology, no offer of anything else, nothing at all. It was New Years Eve so I understand the hotel was busy, but as Seinfeld says, \"you can take the reservation, you just can't keep the reservation.\" We had also called several days prior to ensure that the pool would be open new years eve so that the kids had somewhere to be and we were assured it would be. When we checked in, we were then informed that the pool closed at 8PM as did the club lounge, which we were also told would be open. So now were here in the city with no place for the teenagers to be other than the room since there is nothing in the area for anyone under 21 after 9PM. The final straw was upon checkout. We are Starwood Gold members and had received a 50% room coupon in the mail which we intended to use and informed them of this when we booked the reservation. When we checked out, there was not the 50% discount but the full rack rate. Once again, our front desk friend Dave came and told me \"take it up with Starwood, there is nothing I can do\". Basically he informed me that Starwood jacks up the rates (in this case to well over $500/night) and then takes the 50% discount so now I'm around $240 or so for the night. I could have gotten a better deal just booking on the hotel website as our friends that stayed the same night paid $189/night. The hotel itself is decent, albeit a bit worn, and in a good location. Other than that, there are plenty of other hotels in the area that offer a much higher level of service for the same money.

We had also stopped by the concierge desk to check on the estimated cost of a taxi ride to the restaurant I had chosen to celebrate our anniversary dinner and the concierge provided us with a gift card for the restaurant that covered the cost of our taxi ride.

(We have not checked out the Westins because they do not have swimming pools & we have two boys so...) I feel compelled to write a review for Sheraton because I have read some negative reviews by, surprisingly, SPG Platinum members (on TripAdvisor and this \"other\" website where all the frequent flyers kvetch, you know which website I am referring to...) One person complained so much about the hotel, starting from the bed being awful which caused one other member to say that their company was in the process to move 5 travelers away from the hotel. I have stayed in a lot of SPG hotels, and the beds in this Sheraton are the same as the other Sheratons and are just as comfortable as those in the other SPG hotels, including Westins. (In case you are wondering: we have Tempurpedic at home so yes we have been spoiled...) So I am motivated to restore some justice, I guess. Location: BEST location ever unless you need to stay in the heart of happening Chicago where if you step right out, there is a trendy bar. The hotel is by the river, so you get the view. If you come out of the hotel from the very bottom in the back, there is the riverside walkway: you can head either towards the Mag Mile, cross the bridge and head towards the Millennium Park, Grant Park (& the Art Institute), or Navy Pier. It is always a nice walk by the river in any of these directions. (Please note: I have never stayed in Chicago in the dead of winter, so yes, the experience would be I assume totally different if you are freezing to death. But that is Chicago in the winter...) Convenience: If you have small kids, you'd appreciate the Dominics grocery story and Walgreens just down the street from the hotel. If you crave something fancy, Fox and Obel is not that far away either. And there is a well-stocked wine (liquor) store near by also. The room is nicely-sized. By no means large but the four of us did not feel the urge to murder each other in a room with 2 double beds. i.e. not cramped or claustrophobic. The room was always clean when we stayed there. We have never had any problem with house keeping. The swimming pool/gym area is well appointed. I do NOT work out so I cannot comment on the machines. But whenever I walked by, the area looked clean and well-equipped and in general nice. My family really enjoyed the swimming pool area. Again, it was always clean and there were plenty of clean towels to go around (as opposed to Four Points which is a different story...) NO hot tub would be my only complaint about this hotel. There however is a sauna. But you cannot drink while keeping an eye on the kids in the sauna.

I was looking forward to it, as the location and facility appears fantastic. I often stay at Sheraton and Westins, and tend to be satisfied with the brands. This hotel however failed to meet the standards I would expect from event a non-Starwood frequent guest. I checked in around 1pm. The hotel was very busy due to a couple of conferences in the hotel. The rate was exhorbinantly high-$279-however no hotel in Chicago that night was less than $199. I had booked a double room, and asked for a king. No kings available at that point \"the hotel is sold out\", so I gladly accepted a double on a high floor. The front desk clerk was generally nice and quick, and, as a Platinum member, asked me what Platinum amenity I would like. I was given an option of 500 SPG points or a free movie or a $10 credit on the minibar. I usually take the points, but decided to take the minibar credit instead. When I got to the room it was exhorbantly hot due to the sun shining through the window. I put the AC on high cool, and left for my meetings that afternoon. When I returned about 5:30pm, it was still hot. I dealt with it as long as I could. About 7/7:10 I called guest request for someone to look at it. 75 minutes later I got a call from the operator to see how things were. I told her no one had been there yet, and it was quite hot. Someone came up, changed the filter, and colder faster air began to move. Around 6pm, I decided to get a cool drink with my $10 mini bar credit. I opened the refrigerator and everything was warm. They did state they would credit me the drink I had opened and I asked to switch back to the 500 points. The food choices in this hotel are not very good. Shulas is very expensive and well beyond the average traveler's budget, so I decided to try the burger place. Closed. No other options other than room service, so I went down to Michigan Avenue and had a great dinner at Bandera. The valet service is quite bad. They were never busy, and even when I would call 10-15 minutes down for my car (three occasions), they never started to get my car until I got there and showed my ticket. Then, another 10 minute wait. This was the first time I have NOT tipped a valet. They kept looking at me like they were surprised to see me. For $49/night valet, I expect more attentive service. As a frequent traveler, I'm used to getting rooms in nice condition, often an upgrade, or a good view, etc. This room, while the view of the river was nice, was very worn, walls/baseboards scratched and felt very small. The bathroom is tiny. The internet system in the rooms, as mentioned by others, is DREADFUL. I couldn't get my work system to connect at all wireless or wired, and my personal one took 45 minutes to connect--the internet in the club works well. The Club is nice in appearance, but the food choices are much less than the Hyatt Regency Club. The hors' deuovers were very weak, dessert was a stack of cookies, and breakfast was average at best. No alcohol is served in this club, unlike other chains. When I tried to enter for breakfast, my key would not work--so it was 33 stories back down the lobby. I was over the whole experience by this point, as it got worse and worse. When a few employees, who never used my name or recognized my status, realized I was not happy, the Manager on Duty called at about 9pm. Nice gesture, and I unloaded on her, and she apologized, but anything she could do was too little too late. I let her know I would not be back. The Hyatt has great rooms for even non elites, a better selection of foods and drinks in the club, and MUCH better and consistent service.

Not only can you hear everything in the hallways but there are acutally cracks in between the door and frame where u can see into the room!

The price point at the Sheraton is a great value, however valet parking and internet charges can add up. I did find service somewhat inconsistent at this hotel. Housekeeping was delightful each trip, while the valet was slow and inattentive. When I ordered room service, although the food arrived quickly, the food was dreadful. When I called to speak with someone about it, they were less than considerate. As a frequent traveler and SPG Platinum member, I was most suprised by how things were handled at Check in. The first stay I was greeted warmly, and kindly offered access to the club lounge, altough they could not upgrade me to the club floor. My most recent stay, I was told they wanted to charge me $50 for an upgraded room (should be standard and no charge for SPG platinum) and that if I wanted access to the club lounge that would also come at a price.

The negatives were a shower that did not drain, a worn shower curtain, air conditioning that did not work well, and tired looking carpets and bedding. The second room was also on a high floor with a river view with many of the same negatives. All in all, I would recommend staying at a different downtown Chicago hotel.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, ON", "Title": "\u201cNot bad.....if you get a great price.\u201d", "Author": "12688", "ReviewID": "UR70707729", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers, Chicago, IL. I have always had mixed feelings about this hotel, and this trip was no different. The location is great, 2 blocks off Michigan Avenue. Nearby Walgreens, Domenic's Grocery store, restaurants, bars, river, etc, etc, etc. Location: Ideal. Parking/Valet: Promptly greeted by valet when I pulled in the circle drive. I had no intention of using valet, but was dropping off my fellow passengers. I was greeted by a gentleman with an Irish accent...his name escapes me. Very professional, and courteous. Helpful and friendly. A+. Used the self-park- $35 per day. Not the worst I've heard of in downtown Chicago....considering parking comes at a huge premium in big cities! Front Desk- although couldn't upgrade me to anything, did provide me with a decent room facing the front entrance/Hancock building. Fast, efficient, friendly. Room- Small. Outdated lights. 2 of which didn't work. Bathroom was borderline embarassing. Small amount of mold noticed on calking around bathtub. Gross. Stained (redish pink) hand towels. Very Gross. Could hear doors slamming all morning starting around 7am and went until I decided to get up. So much for sleeping in. Internet- expensive. Oh, and I made 1 local telephone call and it cost me $2. This hotel seems to nickel and dime you where they can, well, most Sheraton seem to. Although I don't expect free calls, wi-fi, parking, healthclub, it bothers me when they charge steep rates for all or most of them. ie 2 drinks in Chi Bar coming to nealy 30 dollars. C'mon.........really? Yes, I like this hotel's location. Most of it's staff. Definitely the beds. Not the slamming doors, bloody hand cloths, or 15 dollar drinks. In closing I would reluctantly recommend this hotel, if money isn't an issue for you.

He could not even give me a discount on my bill because he said I booked it through Expedia. All in all, our trip to Chicago was great but I would NEVER EVER stay at this hotel again.

Location is good, with easy access to the Loop, Navy Pier/Lakeshore and Magnificient Mile. Cons: - Bathroom is in bad need of a plumber. Faucet drains very poorly, toilet upon flushing won't stop running water till you shake the handle a few times, turning shower on almost broke the bathtub faucet out of the wall. - Air conditioning works OK but is quaint: there is no automatic temperature control. The cold air blows straight towards the bed, I almost caught cold while sleeping - Lamp by the bed burnt out and does not work - They charge $12 for fitness per day (I never have this problem with Marriott, non only in the US but even in London where everybody charges for everything). ANyway I went jogging on Lakeshore instead, as the weather was good. - None of the printers in the business area works; one of the two is even physically visibly broken, and nobody cares. I was unable to print the boarding pass. - Hotel reception/concierge are useless: as I came for corporate meetings the hotel staff was unable to direct me to tht proper meeting rooms; they had no clue where our meting is located - Other inquires with the reception weren't helpful either: I arrived around 10pm on Thurs and to my question about the best place to get a late dinner they suggested room service as an only option. Mind you, this is in Chicago, not Des Moines. Also when I asked for a local map (for jogging, since they charge for gym) they gave me some useless piece of paper without the map and with terse description in plain text on how to access Lakeshore trail. I had opportunities in the near past to stay in Marriott-branded hotels within a few blocks from this Sheraton and in the future I would always take that preference. This time it was booked by corporate for the meeting; hope they won't make this mistake again. With the long list of other hotels in Downtown Chicago I wouldn't recommend this Sheraton.

Maybe I just wasn't lucky, but still. The decor of the guestroom and the bathroom needs to be changed. Beds were comfortable but everything else looks tired and needs to be renovated. The hallways were cold and depressing. Internet was spotty. It kept on charging us each time we logged on to surf the net. Talked to guest services and front desk about the problem and they took the extra charges off. If you are in Chicago for a weekend with your family or friends and just need a place to crash (and you are low-maintenance), this is more than adequate, but if you are used to traveling on business and expecting a higher standard of service and product, then I'd think twice.

We found the mini bar inside the dresser/tv stand. It was disgusting. I would never have eaten anything that had been in that thing. Then we discovered that once you opened the doors on the dresser, they wouldn't stay shut unless slammed. My friend decided she wanted to take a nice long bath and went into the bathroom.

We'd recommend it, but likely would try a different hotel the next time we're in the city.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat City, just an okay hotel\u201d", "Author": "SOTB1", "ReviewID": "UR52447860", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to Chicago for a personal trip on December 29, for 3 nights. We went for the Chicago Blackhawks New Year's Eve Game vs. the New Jersey Devils, and the Hawks won 5-1. What a game! The Hawks have the most amazing fans, such passion! Most people there that night were in the Hawks colors; jerseys, jackets, shirts, it was definitely a night to remember! The United Centre was full with excitement that night, what a great place! If you are a hockey fan, you should listen to their Goal Horn on You Tube, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best I have ever heard. Their opening videos were awesome too! This is the best game environment I have ever seen, and so far, this was the 5th NHL Arena I have attended. You can tell that the Chicago Blackhawks have been working hard on putting together a team of Staff that are pleasant, friendly and helpful. Hotel We stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, and although this hotel is located in a great location, it definitely needs some renovations. I would rate this a 3 star hotel, it was clean for the most part, just getting rundown. Parking is below the hotel, it is a big city so parking is expensive, and our $35 a night was actually an okay price. If you have mobility issues or lots of kids/luggage, you might want to consider Valet, as the walk back to the Hotel Lobby is a bit long. We felt safe here in Chicago, there is a lot to see and do, it is up to you just how much walking, shopping, eating and sightseeing you want to do. On New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve night, the hotel was full and I guess security was doing its best but it was lacking, as we had people running up and down the hallways at midnight pounding on the doors and hollering, nice! The next morning, we noticed a lamp on the floor, toppled over and unplugged, it was one of those lamps on the table by the elevators. We mentioned this to the Front Desk Staff and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care, and an hour later when we left to check out, it was still there. This part is definitely worth mentioning, on our last day at the breakfast buffet, someone threw up at their entrance and on the carpet on the way to the washrooms, not a very appealing sight or smell, and about a hour later, the mess still hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned up, there towels on the puke at the doorway and there were still chunks of food on the carpet on the way to the washrooms, a line of food about 4 feet long, and the smell, you can just imagine. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why it took so long to clean up that mess, you would think that they would be all over that given the location of the restaurant entrance and hallway to the parking garage, the smell was very powerful. I was disappointed with Guest Services too, we order a box of Kleenex and some plastic cups, it took 3 calls to Guest Services, this was very slow service, from my 1st phone call to 3rd phone call, it was probably an hour. Sights We walked down to the Navy Pier, not much happening there this time of the year, mostly limited kids/family activities, I hear it is really busy in the summer. They have dinner cruises going out from here too. We hit the Magnificent Mile, and there is a ton of shopping/window shopping here, lots of great stores, bring your credit cards! The bridges and waterways are really nice, lots of great opportunities for pictures. We were only there for 2 days, and with the cold weather, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to sightsee as much as we would of liked to. The AMC Theatre is just across the parking lot of the hotel, I think it has 21 theatres, it was huge and busy, and we went one night and saw a movie, Avatar. The Magnificent Mile is walking distance away, only 3 blocks. We did a ton on walking, we used taxis to and from the United Centre for the game, and we felt safe. The cost of a taxi to the United Centre was about $11 each way. Food We only ate 1 meal at the Hotel; they were a bit pricey for us. We had their breakfast buffet on the last day, $22.95/person, it was good food. Usually for breakfast we ate at the West Egg Cafe, 620 North Fairbanks Court, it was good, busy and reasonably priced, just up the Street from the hotel about 2 blocks. We went to the Dominick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grocery store a few times across the parking lot, for a few items and for the Starbucks there. Actually there is a Starbucks on every other corner here in Chicago, they are everywhere. We had lunch at the Burrito Beach, 200 East Ohio Street; we loved these burritos, we wish we could get them here in Canada. We ate dinner at the Dao Thai Restaurant, 230 East Ohio Street, Chicago, we enjoyed this restaurant too! On our last night we went to Pizzeria Uno, 29 East Ohio Street, this was a bit of a disappointment. We had their special and it was kind of boring, no real flavor, just pizza with lots of veggies and very little pepperoni or sausage. Their crust was flavorless too, just dough (for me it was a waste of carbs LOL). This place requested us to order our food as soon as we arrived and had us sitting in their lobby until our table is ready, as the pizzas take an hour to cook. We wouldn't go back and I would try another pizza place, in our mind it wasn't the best. We actually preferred the pizza at the Dominick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grocery Store. We loved Garrett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popcorn, there is a location just off the Magnificent Mile and at Navy Pier, yummy! I am sure Chicago is beautiful in the nicer/warmer months being on the water and all. In the winter, they have lights up and the City is well taken care, that is obvious, not a lot of begging or people sleeping in the streets, or even cigarette butts littered around. Yes it is windy and cold, if you are going in the winter and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wear a hat, at least get earmuffs. We will definitely be going back to Chicago in nicer/warmer weather. I really like the walkways along the waterways both the lake and the river. There is a lot history here and the buildings are been taken care of.

I read the reviews here and assumed we were headed for a nightmare. Well, not so. OK, let's be realistic. Are there nicer hotels? SURE. But this is a Sheraton. It's big and it's a big chain hotel. But don't let the reviews scare you. My wife and I like to enjoy nice hotels and she really enjoyed the Sheraton. In fact, much more than another Hotel we stayed at in Chicago which is rated WAY higher on TripAdvisor. First - The location is amazing. Second - The beds are fine. In fact, I'd be willing to say the beds are very comfy. I never slept so well. VERY soft but also very nice. Third - The hotel itself being large can look a bit run down in the hallways and what not, it's older. But our room was fine, big flat screen TV, amazing view. It's cheap folks, I see a lot of people paying $60-70 on priceline and then complaining... well that's just wrong. If you want to pay for a fine Hotel, don't use priceline. I love priceline and take what they give me with no issues. $75 bucks a night on a weekend in Chicago at a decent quality Hotel with a location like the Sheraton is a 100% no-brainer. Fourth - The staff. Awesome. We got an early check-in no problem at all at 10AM on a Thursday morning. The concierge was just awesome. Going the extra mile to answer any questions we had. Fifth and finally, the Hotel is super quiet. AS I mentioned, we stayed at a Hotel ranked much higher but it was down on Michigan Avenue and WAY louder. We couldnt hear a peep in the Sheraton. But again, keep in mind this hotel is much larger than many of the smaller boutique swanky Hotels, so there are lots of people, kids, families. No issues at all. Cons - Parking in Chicago sucks everywhere. Be prepared to pay 35- $50 bucks a night. And if you check in at noon and leave the next day at 12:10 - be prepared to get nailed for that extra 10 minutes. We found cheaper parking at the Park but the last day had to take a cab to get there, in the end it pretty much worked out the same anyways.

We spent 3 nights there and found the hotel to be very nice. I'll give a quick review of a few areas of interest, concern. BEDS : I was very concerned after reading the reviews about being miserable. I found the beds very nice. They are certainly not the slab of concrete we've found in many hotels but neither are they the broken down, sagging in the middle beds one might find in a super cheap hotel. Both my husband, who has a bad back,and I found them very comfortable. My only slight \"down\" side to the beds was it would sure be nice if more hotels offered double bedded hotels with queen rather than full size beds. We sleep in a king at home and a double is quite small for the two of us - or family rooms with a queen and a bunk bed? Sure would make taking the kids on vacation more pleasant. LOCATION : Fabulous - easy walk to Navy Pier or Millenium Park. We did both walks at least twice while we were there. If you're there during the summer, don't miss out on the Navy Pier fireworks on Wed & Sat. We went Wednesday and they were definitely a hit. We had a nice view of the river and downtown from our room. ROOM / CLEANLINESS / Etc : The room was on the average to small standard hotel room. We don't spend that much time in our room so it was fine but it certainly wasn't huge. We loved the view. An additional chair to just sit and watch out the window might have been nice but with two beds, it would have been a tight fit to squeeze another chair in. The room was certainly clean enough and the cleaning staff we did encounter were very friendly. We had no complaints on size or cleanliness. STAFF : We didn't interact with the staff much but the person who checked us in was very nice. The las night we went to a bar in the hotel (Java I think?) for a drink and took our 2 young children. The waitress was very nice and even brought out a complimentary Shirley Temple for the kids. They were thrilled and it certainly let us enjoy our drink more than we expected.

I found no issues. This a very large convention style hotel. It is stylish, well maintained, and professionally staffed. In many aspects, this is an elegant hotel, well maintained. The location is on the north side the Chicago river, technically across from the river walk. By taking an escalator down from the lobby level, guests can walk right out onto the very attractive riverside plaza and walkway, running from Lakeshore to Michigan Avenue. You can easily walk to Michigan Ave and cross to the other side which extends much further east. There is a beautiful fountain (Centennial Fountain) just yards away from the hotel, with pleasant benches and a couple of restaurants with outdoor seating. A short walk away are docks for river tour boats. We enjoyed a one hour \"architectural\" cruise a lot more than I expected - you get great views of all the major buildings. The proximity of the river and the plaza areas are a big plus in my view. This section was pretty uncrowded and sedate, and offers stunning views of the river. During warm weather as we had, it made the downtown location totally pleasant. I particularly enjoyed drinking my morning coffee and reading for a half hour or so in one of those \"life is good\" moments watching residents of nearby condos jogging, walking their dogs and such. The hotel amenities are all first class, and if you don't mind paying $22 for a breakfast buffet (as an example), the quality is good, with stylish and tasteful decor. I travelled with my young adult son to see a Cubs game, and while it was not all that convenient to Wrigley, we had no complaints. The rate at Priceline was $189 (there was an airshow on Saturday, and they were full), but I did not find any great bargains at hotels downtown. We arrived at about noon and requested an early check-in, which was happily granted. Our room on the 11th floor looked east along the Chicago river, and the view was outstanding - looking over the water with the new Trump hotel dominating the view, along with the Wrigley building. We were very impressed. I imagine most rooms on higher floors will have good views. All my contacts with reception, concierge, even housekeeping and bellmen (we stored our bags for a few hours the last day) were 100% pleasant and professional. I found the beds OK (not remarkable in any way), but I would agree that noises in the hallway and adjacent rooms are rather easily heard. In our case, our neighbors were not very noisy, although I can imagine that this could be problematic. I would have appreciated free wireless internet connections (I think the service was $12 a day) but they did have about 8 nice computers connected to a printer that guests could use free in the coffee shop - which incidentally was pretty good (with somewhat inflated pricing). Again, prompt and friendly service there. Overall, we enjoyed the visit to Chicago, and I thought this \"big city\" visit was far more pleasant than a similar trip last year to NYC, with the hotel and its staff hitting very high standards.

Concierge: There was always a huge queue. I gave up. Decor: Wall coverings looked new. Carpets not so new? Odd. Safe: The safe in my room was VERY small. Maybe about 4 or 5 inches deep? I could not fit my laptop into the safe along with my other stuff. Also, the safe in my room required a key, so I had to carry the key around with me for the rest of the weekend. All in all, it felt a bit soulless and corporatey. I like the Kimpton properties better. (Not the Allegro though.

However, we walked back to the hotel. Count on a $40-$50 cab ride to/from the airport and about 1/2 an hour depending on traffic. The Facility- The hotel is huge and is perfect for a conference or convention. It has several restaurants. We only tried the burger place. Kind of overpriced for what they serve but it is pretty being next to the river. The service kind of stunk too. The hotel has an indoor pool and gym but we weren't able to make it to either so I can not comment on the quality of those but I do know they are available. Also, the hotel has a \"Links Cafe\" that has complimentary internet service with a printer! We had to use this when we tried to book a trolley tour. It was very easy to use and quite helpful. Also serves yummy sandwhiches and coffee while you surf the net or take care of business issues. The Room- Our view was pretty (please see pic). The beds though were HORRIBLE. They were so soft. We literally sunk into them. The pillows were entirely too soft as well. It made three nights of sleeping pretty painful. It is because of the beds that I would not recommend this hotel. If you like soft beds, then you will like the hotel and I would feel more able to recommend it. The pillows underneath the pillow cases also looked very dingy. Kind of gross. The bathroom was spacious but no frills. The room had a flat screen tv with HD channels but no refridgerator which we would have liked for leftovers or cold drinks; especially because the Sheraton DOES NOT have vending machines! That is another complaint. We couldn't get a cold drink of water when we wanted to, that's bad. The Staff- The staff was so friendly. The room was cleaned when we wanted (they actually pay attention to the tag on the door!!) and the concierge was very helpful. Really, all the staff at the hotel should be commended.

Pluses: The location is absolutely perfect, with North Michigan Avenue and the Loop each a block away. The guest rooms are of a reasonable size, with drop-dead views of the lake and the river. The hotel is modern and clean. The Club Lounge is very nicely designed and offers a standard Continental breakfast -- nothing special. Minuses: The beds are absolutely horrendous. Whatever the opposite of a Heavenly Bed is, that's what they've got here. The mattresses are so soft and mushy that when you lie down, you sink right in, with absolutely no support. (Apparently, the hotel installed these mattresses in the whole hotel just a few months ago thinking that softer is better, but according to the Guest Services representative, they've had so many complaints about the mattresses that the will be replacing the whole lot again soon.) Service is very impersonal, and there always seems to be a long line at the front desk. In-room internet is horrendously slow and not cheap. The gym has a really nice lap pool and sundeck, which are free, but the workout area is surprisingly small (and expensive) for a hotel of this size. The business center was staffed with nasty people. They misplaced my Fedex package for hours, and they were not at all apologetic about it (although the front desk clerk did apologize on their behalf). In brief: If you don't intend to do anything in the hotel besides sleep and need to be in this location, then this is a fine place to stay -- once the hotel has done something about the mattresses.

After our first night, I left a note (and generous tip), for housekeeping asking asking them to please do an extra good job vacuuming and dusting. I also mentioned that the room felt really dirty. When we returned to our room, I could tell the room had been \"cleaned\" as the beds were made, but not much else. Most of the dirt, dust, and crumbs, that were there in the morning, we still there. I went down the hall and asked a housekeeper if I could borrow her vacuum. She said \"are you the one with the note, I did the best I could\". I spend the next 25 minutes vacuuming our room myself. By the way, I am not really a clean freak or anything like that, but the dust, dirt, and smelliness was really gross. Also, we were paying more that $300 per night for this room. In addition to the dirtiness, the bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bed sagged excessively in middle when my husband and I both lay on the bed. After five nights, we packed our bags to leave and my husband looked under the bed to make sure we didn't leave anything behind. Guess what he found? A broken bed friend.

The valet parking price was average for downtown Chicago ($30/day) and we expected to pay that. We had a fantastic room on the 30th floor that overlooked Navy Pier. The room was clean and the service was great. Everyone at the hotel asked how they could help and were more than willng to make sure that the stay was comfortable. The staff was very familiar with the town and could easily navigate us to just about any place we wanted to go. We were really impressed. We could easily get to just about every Chicago attraction easily from this hotel. We even got to the Sears tower for less than $7.00 via a cab. Michigan Ave. was extremely close, Navy Pier was walkable and there were a ton of great retaurants around. In short, most everything was within walking distance. The only thing that we did have issues with were the beds. They had supposedly gotten \"new mattresses\" that were supposed to be \"dream beds\" or something like that. Man, I think that Satan himself made these mattresses. They were soft to a fault. It was like sinking into a half-filled waterbed. No support and they dipped into a shape of a \"U\" when laying down on them (felt more like a \"V\" to me). We did say something about them when checking out. We were told that some of the mattresses that were installed were found to be defective and they are replacing some. I would say that ours were defective as the sleep was limited and the back pain was incredible. Overall, the experience (minus the beds) was great.

We booked our room through the hotel's website so we could guarantee our room type. We got to the hotel late and unfortunately since it was New Years, the hotel was PACKED! People were everywhere and we could barely park our car in the front to valet it. We wanted to find a parking garage but we were too tired. Valet is 42 dollars and I suggest you dont use it b/c it's crap. Basically when you pick your car up they dont just bring it to you already running and warmed up. You go below the hotel and all the cars are parked one behind the other turned off. You have to go figure out where to get your keys and then if you're parked behind someone that's not there yet or not ready to leave you pretty much have to just sit there and wait. Now we just happened to stumble on a self parking garage attached to the hotel that nobody wanted to tell us about. There is an elevator that takes you from this garage to the 2nd floor. It's 30 something to park there for 24 hrs. The good thing about it is you dont have to pay that flat rate like you do at the hotel. I would suggest taking advantage of this garage if you want to save money and time. Anyway, we go to check in and they tell us we were staying in a room with double beds after we specifically booked a king through them about 5 months in advance. They told us they were booked for the night and possibly could give us a king the next day. I thought this was wrong b/c our reservation did not say that there's a possiblity that we may not get our bed type like travel websites say. IF it had said this then i would have understood but we were tired and just wanted to have a nice vacation without having to change rooms. Basically she couldnt do anything but give us free breakfast coupons. Whoopee. Granted it was for the 25 dollar a head buffet but still we didnt plan on eating at the hotel but there was nothing we could do. Room was adequate. Just a plain old room. The mattresses on the bed are so soft that you actually sink into them. This may sound good for some people but if you need some support on your back and you're used to a more firm bed, you're going to have trouble with these mattresses. There wasn't any noise we could hear through the walls but outside the door from your bed you can hear EVERYTHING. All we heard every night we were there, not just New Years where you expect it to be loud, were doors SLAMMING and people yelling in the halls. I got woken up every single night by the doors slamming. It was awful. Our room we got switched to the next day, which was a king but no upgrade, apology or anything was a view of the \"lake\" Well we couldnt see the lake b/c all the buildings were covering it. Oh and we also didnt get moved until 6 pm. How caring and concerned they were. Well saturday morning we got woken up by a loud helicopter helping take construction up to the top of a buliding across the street. There is a bunch of construction there so it will be noisy in the mornings. The location of the hotel was convenient though. About a 5 minute drive to Navy pier, we were able to walk there in the 12 degree weather :) on New Years. Right across the street from a movie theatre and bowling alley. About 5 minutes from the museums. For the price it was the cheapest we could find for the location we were looking for. I would try and find something better next time.

Please look at my past reviews - I am very fair - but the lack of a soundproof door (and walls) is a huge shortcoming of this Sheraton - and quite unexpected.

The hotel sits a block off of Michigan Avenue in the heart of the city. Being on the river adds to the ambiance. The OK - Bathroom.

Instead of having light switches located on the wall next to the bed, my wife had to reach for a lamp on the nightstand. Poor attention to details. The Ugly - Sound proofing of room. I don't know how to be more clear here - it was as if the room didn't have a door. I could hear practically everything that occurred in the hallway. Whether it was small talk of other guests or other room doors closing - IT WAS TERRIBLE waking up both my wife and I on multiple occasions. - Sound of neighboring room's bathrooms.

We checked out the club lounge and it was nice but cant comment on the food offerings or breakfast as we missed both of those but it was a nice looking lounge but since I consider most lounge offerings in the US to be useless I rarely spend much time in them. We got upgraded to a suite, which was really a regular room connected to a large hospitality suite. We did not get much use of the additional space as we spent very little time in the room but I think the suite was large enough to actually have 3 entrances. Very nice upgrade really. Also, the check in person mentioned that I could get free internet in the lounge or the room as a club floor guest which is a nice perk. We did have some drinks in the Chibar which I do not remember being at the hotel during my last stay and it is a nice place but not really that large. They had karaoke that night and it was actually fun. the drink prices are a little high I think, even for a hotel bar. The service was very spotty though. Definitely better options for drinking nearby but had a good time none the less. Breakfast was to be had at Shulas and that place has no character at all.

The juice glasses were dirty...for $22-23 per person, could they at least polish the water spots off the glassware? The food at the breakfast buffet was good, but not worth the price. Service was o.k., just. Maid service was pitiful. The first day, we got no maid service at all...after being out all day, we got back to unmade beds & no fresh towels...we called at 5:00 p.m. to request maid service, They said they'd get maid service up right away (we saw maid carts still out on our floor at the time, so it wasn't as if they'd all gone home already ). We asked that they at least bring towels (3 adults in room, we'd used the 3 towels that morning) We left for the evening, and when we returned at 9 p.m. still no maids, no towels. Called down & asked for towels again since had to be out of the room early next a.m. for business meetings. We were told they'd be right up. Hour later, still no towels. Called again, and they finally showed up with towels at 10:30. Had maid service the following days, but they repeatedly left only 2 coffees/2 coffee cups on the coffee service (Each coffee packet made one serving, and the cups were paper Starbucks cups meant for single use) We had left a note telling them there were 3 adults in the room...and we were paying for 3 adults in the room) Finally on last day maid left 3 coffees...a little late! The bedding was comfortable, but showing wear (one of the bedspreads had iron burns in it!) After check out, it took the valet parking guys almost 30 minutes to bring our car! We watched car after car arrive for people who had just come down. Our bellman with our luggage bumped them 3 times in 15 minutes, then he went back upstairs.

I'll focus on the positive first: The location is great, walking distance to Navy Pier and many other sights. We had a great view of the lake from our room, it was beautiful. And the beds were easily the best thing about the hotel. Phenomenally comfortable. The fact that you have to pay for wireless internet is disappointing, but the fact that you have to pay to use the fitness center is ludicrous! Sheraton should get into the airline business they way they nickel-and-dime their customers at this place. Our room was rarely actually cleaned during our stay, and on the days it was, it didn't happen until around 4pm or so. \"Cleaning\" consisted of rearranging the blankets on the bed and emptying some of the trash cans -- no vacuuming, cleaning of the bathroom, etc. In fact, when I first arrived in the room, the bathroom floor was covered in mysterious blue-green stains. They were diligent about cleaning the OUTSIDE of the hotel, however -- at one point, my mother walked out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel to find a window washer hanging outside our window. Most hotels warn you about stuff like that, but not the Sheraton Chicago. The final straw came on the last couple of nights when the guests next door to us were running up and down the halls, slamming doors, and shouting profanity. We called down to the front desk multiple times but nobody ever showed up or did anything about it. Chicago was beautiful, the people were great, but I can't imagine why anyone would stay here for the price, especially considering all the options in the area.

Anyway we were given a small corner room with one king size bed and small sofa. It was more than enough for the two of us so we were very happy. The view was spectacular, a wonderful panoramic of the river, the pier, and the lake. Check in was expedient. The front desk was very professional and friendlly. After a rather long night at some of the downtown bars we returned to order late night/early morning room service. They did get my eggs wrong but when you are drunk and hungry you eat it anyway. I called down to let them know about the error (hoping they would send me the right eggs) instead they said to take it up with the front desk upon check out. I figured, ok, I'll mention it. When we checked out the clerk asked about our stay, I mentioned the room service order. She said no problem and removed it from the bill. I liked that I didn't have to complain or be obnoxious.

I got a very prompt response confirming my request. I didn't get to the hotel until 10PM. The valet was very nice and they kept asking if I wanted to self park. I didn't think anything of it, but opted to valet. Check-in went smoothly and I was checked into room 2718 (the Starwood preferred floor.) The room was very large with a nice view. The hotel itself isn't brand new and there was some wear and tear, but overall the property does seem well maintained. The bed was comfortable. The work space was very large. The seating area was great. The bathroom was spacious and clean. They stock the regular Sheraton bath products. The towels and robes were clean and plentiful. They also have a safe in the closet that will easily accommodate a laptop. I went downstairs at 10:35PM and found out that their Shula's Steakhouse closes at 10:30PM. There are no restaurants around that hotel that serve late. The concierge suggested PJ Clarks...I went and everyone I saw was smoking and drinking pints. It looked fun...just not for dinner. I went back to the hotel and found out that the late night menu also starts at 10:30PM. The menu is VERY limited and the food was not good. It was very disappointing. I went to check out the next morning and found out that valet parking is $41/day. That explained why everyone kept looking at me funny when I said I wanted to valet. I wasn't even paying and I find $41offensive. The front desk girl said it was stamped on my valet ticket. We looked and mine wasn't stamped. She also said their was a sign out front and pointed to it...the sign was no where near where valet had me pull up to or where I walked in the hotel.

Booked the room via Priceline \"Name Your Price.\" In Priceline's system, the Sheraton is a four star hotel. In my experience, it's not. It's a three star at $250 for the night, including all taxes....but not parking. Self parking in an attached, and somewhat difficult to find, parking garage, was $29 a night. If you've already booked this hotel at a price you feel comfortable with, don't freak out. The location is probably why you booked, and you won't be disappointed. Read on if you want more observations. On the plus side: The location is perfect for spending a Saturday night in Chicago. Lots of great attractions nearby, including Navy Pier, which is within walking distance. The front desk staff was very helpful, the lobby was huge, and all the up-front public areas gave the impression that this was indeed a four star hotel. Short cab rides will get you almost everywhere in the north Loop/River North area, if you don't feel like walking. The only meal we had at the Sheraton was breakfast at the Riverside Cafe. $14 for Eggs Benedict...which were about the best EB's I've had the pleasure to eat. $3 for coffee...you get the idea. Hey, it's Chicago. Four star prices, but they delivered on the quality. The view from the 20th floor was nice. We looked across the Chicago River at the Swissotel, and the background high rises looked terrific at night. Elevators were fast, and zoned, so if your room was on the 20th floor, you'd use the bank of elevators that served floors 18-30. Never had to wait more than 30 seconds. The minuses. Towels. Holy cow, what are they doing with worn out bath towels in the Sheraton? Literally beyond \"end of useful life\". No, I didn't bother to call and complain. Should I have to? Serious deficiency for a \"4 Star\" rating in my book. The bathroom tub surround tile and floor tile. I'm not a decorator, but multi-color, stained tile grout doesn't trip my trigger. The bathtub no-slip strips. Am I too picky when I say I don't like soiled strips? Pay for internet service. What? This is 2007 for cryin' out loud. Why should I pay 5 bucks for 30 minutes? Or 12 bucks for 24 hours? By the time I got to my room and figured out that I was paying 29 bucks to park my car, and walked 1/4 mile to the lobby, I wasn't in the mood. True, in my business travels to Europe, I've had to pay, but this is the US of A, where Al Gore invented the Internet. I was getting globally warm in my room by this point. No fresh smell. Maybe I'm too fussy, but there just wasn't a \"freshness\" about the room. I spent last weekend at a Country Inns and Suites in Madison, and my room there had a nice, crisp freshness to it. Not the Sheraton. If you're so inclined, you can crack the window about 6 inches. The Chicago River is neutrally fragrant.

They seemed to be all over the place. More negative reviews seem to be older postings--whereas more of the newer ones are more positive. B/C I was uncertain I contacted a guest coordinator prior to our stay. She was great--she not only followed through (ensuring us a great room)--but followed-up upon our arrival. I would recommend doing this if you are uncertain. Here's my take: Location: This hotel is in a great location--positioned between Mag mile and Navy Pier. We had an excellent view of the river and city skyline. Right by the NBC building. In room amenities: free amenities are limited. The items in the rooms are overpriced. My recommendation is to go to Walgreens across the street (literally across). There are actually Walgreens everywhere in Chicago. Great place to grab snacks. There is a charge for internet (but not too shocking--as many of the hotels I have stayed--charge. Hamptons are really the only place I've stayed that we have had free in-room access). Hotel Amenities/Transportation: we did not try the pool--didn't even see it. But from what I can gather access to the pool is free. There is a charge for the work-out facility. My recommendation:go walk Mag Mile. We walked everywhere we went (Navy Pier, up and down Mag Mile, Milli. Park, John Hancock Building). We took a shuttle to/from airport--they were very timely. We took a cab to Seoond City. Housekeeping: the rooms and hotel areas that we saw were very clean. I do kind of inspect for this thing--b/c stray hairs in the bed or shower gross me out--I didn't see any here. Housekeeping was also very nice and non-intrusive. We went out everyday about 10:30a-1:30p--and they had the room picked-up/cleaned by the time we got back--with plenty of towels/washclothes/etc. I was happy about this--b/c in several hotels I've stayed before--this can be a issue. Check-in: easy/pleasant/quick. Room size: on the smaller size (but not tiny) compared to some--but it is downtown Chicago and from what I can tell this is common for many hotels downtown based on reviews of the other ones. It's Chicago--we weren't there to stay in the room much anyway--other then to enjoy the view late evening. I do agree with a previous reviewer--turning the loveseat and coffee table around--is a great idea--to sit back and enjoy the view. Our favorite things in Chicago: view from our room, lounge on the 95th floor of the Hancock building, just exploring downtown/Milli. Park-ate some Chicago pizza that day, Second City--the current revue is great--great team of actors. This trip was just my husband and I. We would most definitely stay here again. I really don't think this would be a super-kid friendly place. Great for adults. If I stayed in Chicago with my kids--and wanted to stay downtown--I think I might try the Swissotel (close to the Sheraton)--I saw in their website they have rooms specifically decorated for kids.

The hotel was clean and comfortable. The room (a double) was a little on the small side but fine. They did not have queen size bed, only doubles which was a little cramped when my husband and I were sharing a bed. The location was several blocks from Michigan Ave (approx, 5-8 minute walk,especially with kids). From our room, we were able to see Lake MIchigan and Navy Pier. I thought the location of the hotel could have been better having our lazy kids with us. My younger son did not like walking anywhere and just wanted to take cabs. The city buses are located on Michigan Ave and took about 5-8 minutes to walk there. We took the buses all over town. The train took us to the 2 ball parks. The subway was further away, approxiamtely 10-15 minutes by foot. The food in the hotel was very over priced. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and they charge $3.00 for a samll coffee and $3.00 for a bagel. One of the restaurants in the hotel which was open for breakfast and lunch had a great kids menu for approximately $4.00. The food for the adults was also very overpriced i.e. $21.00 for a breakfast buffet, $12.00 for a waffle, etc. Across the street is a Walgreens which had snacks, water, boxed cereal, etc. I bought snacks for the room and cereal for my kids for breakfast. Also across the street was Dominicks which is a supermarket. There is a Starbucks in there and the coffee was half the price than the hotel. They had a bakery section and all the usual sections in a chain supermarket. There is a lap pool in the hotel which overlooked Lake Shore Drive and Navy Pier. Our kids had fun but sometimes had to share the pool with adults wanting to do laps. On Wed. nights at 9:30, we were able to see the fireworks at Navy Pier from the pool. Great view! Overall, the hotel was fine. If you have kids with you, I would recommend staying closer to Michigan Ave near the buses or trains unless they do not mind walking. State street is also a great place to stay since it is near shopping and all forms of transportation.

The \"common\" area of the hotel (lobby, elevators, seating areas, conference areas and bar/lounge areas are all very nice and it is obvious that Sheraton has put alot into these areas. The only minor problem I encountered was some poor service when getting a coffee in the morning at the lounge bar off the lobby. The employee seemed put out and didn't give great service, but that was a minor issue. The rooms however were a problem. Small is ok, if everything shines. However, small and shabby stinks. The bathroom shower contained the partially used soap and shampoo of a previous guest, there is very little counter area to put anything (shaving, tooth stuff, deodorant, etc..) and the bathroom is generally very small. In the bath, the corners were dirty, the room was also dirty looking and had some areas of disrepair. The view of the river and city were very nice. For fun, I decided to see if the soap would be gone the next day or not, so along with my soap and shampoo set, I left the others in the shower as well.

Here are our pros and cons. Pros: As many have mentioned, great location, central to just about everything one would want to do in downtown Chicago. Great views, too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you get a room facing the river and lake. We got to lie in bed on Saturday night and watch the fireworks at Navy Pier. And the river traffic below was always interesting. The riverwalk is a nice touch (especially if you remember \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chicago) and provided a pleasant escape from the crowds on Michigan Avenue above. And, despite the cons listed below, we had a quite nicely appointed room. Cons: As another reviewer has mentioned, the common areas of the hotel were freezing cold. Much too cold to sit and relax in the lobby/bar. But who would want to anyway, what with the music blaring full blast 24 hours a day? If we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking around for a sweater (despite the heat in the street) we were shouting at each other to be heard over drinks. It was also way too cold in the club level lounge where we feared our morning coffee would ice over if we lingered too long. Note to management: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hotel, not a meat locker. As was also mentioned previously, making the bed is an apparently lost art at the Sheraton. The sheets were simply draped over the mattress and I woke with my feet twisted up in them on more than one occasion. That one I just plain old won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever understand. Again, as already mentioned, there were long lines everywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the front desk to the concierge to the bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just about every time we walked through the lobby. That should really be forgiven, though. It was the height of summer vacation after all. But the savvy traveler will recognize that as one indication of a big, crowded, and somewhat noisy hotel. Finally, front desk staff botched our move from a lower level room to the club level, leaving our luggage unattended all day, and leaving us in our new room to wait for it when we got back from our day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business. And then they left it to a beleaguered bellman to apologize for the mix-up. I imagine staying at the Sheraton might be an altogether different , and much more pleasant, experience in the off season.

I'll start off with what I liked about the hotel: The lobby and first floor of the hotel was very nice. Very spacious and fancy looking. There were always taxis waiting outside if you need to go anywhere. The location for this hotel is excellent - right on the river, and only a block or two from Michigan Avenue. It is also only a short walk (maybe 10 minutes) to the nearest train station, so if the weather is nice there's no need for a taxi. There is a grocery store only a block or two away, along with many wonderful restaurants. My room was on the 14th floor, and we had a great view of the river, Michigan Avenue, and the many buildings (including the new Trump building). From the window near the elevators, I could see Navy Pier. The beds were very comfortable, and there was a nice flat screen tv in the room. I would probably say that in general, the rooms were not much nicer than other rooms I've had at 3 star hotels...they weren't bad rooms, just average, nothing really amazing to set them apart. But the view was incredible We also received a complimentary USA today outside our door every morning. Common areas of the hotel (mostly the first floor/lobby) do have free wireless internet. The concierge at the front desk was very helpful in finding places to eat. Now for things I didn't like as much: it seemed like the hotel nickel and dimed you for every little thing. There is wired internet access in the rooms, but you have to pay for it. There is a gym/workout facility, but you have to pay for it. There is parking across the street, but it costs $29-$39 per night (but what can you expect, you're downtown, so parking is going to be expensive...I didn't have a car though, so it didn't matter to me). There is a well stocked mini-bar under the tv, but it didn't seem to close properly, most of the things in it weren't too cold, and of course the prices were outrageous. We just walked across the street to the grocery store, picked up some beverages and breakfast/snack food, and saved ourselves a ton of money (I think breakfast at the hotel is about $12-$15 per person?...not sure, didn't eat in the hotel at all). Our room had an adjoining door to the room next door, and the door was not very sound-proof. While trying to sleep on our second night, we were kept up to the sounds of our neighbor watching adult movies on his television at a very high volume. Overall, the hotel is very nice, in a great location, and I had a wonderful stay with no major complaints. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, but I will go in knowing that I am paying for the location and convenience, not for all the amenities.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cSheraton is just fine!\u201d", "Author": "KellyMacOH", "ReviewID": "UR7438435", "Content": "I bid on Priceline for a 4-star hotel in the Mich Avenue/Loop area and won the Sheraton Hotel and Towers for $129.

The lobby is typically big-city good looking and busy with conventioneers and tourists. The front desk couldn't have been nicer. I had requested a king room, but the person at the front desk said the only two left had poor views and if I would take a double bedded room I would have a great view. He was so right! Directly above the Chicago River, with a view north to the lake and the south into the city. It was very romantic at night. This is no boutique hotel with chi-chi design touches, but it was handsome and clean. Housekeeping had just finished our room when we checked in and stopped by to make sure everything was fine. We had two double beds with nice duvets and piles of pillows, a desk, an easy chair, TV with honor bar beneath, a huge closet with safe, and very nice bathroom. The towels were thick if not huge and the shower worked perfectly (I could have done with more water pressure, but there was plenty of hot water.) We didn't care because we weren't using it, but the mini fridge didn't seem to be cooling anything at all. The closest el stops are a decent walk, but you can walk two blocks over to Michigan Avenue and catch buses that go up and down Michigan as well as directly to the Museum campus.

My room rates (conference rate) was $199/night. This is a great conference hotel. The conference facilities are nice and convenient. The hotel has a few restaurant choices and the gift shop has many options for snacks. The burger place on the bottom level is great for lunch. The main dining room has a wonderful breakfast buffet. The lobby has the Java Bar for coffee, drinks, pastries and fruit. There is also Chi Bar and Shula's steakhouse. The location is pretty good. It's just a short walk to Michigan Avenue and plenty of shops and restaurants. The views from the hotel are nice since you are right on the Chicago river. However, when I come for pleasure, I prefer to stay towards the northern end of Michigan Avenue because I like to have easy access to the lake. The room was fine. It had a flat screen TV. The internet charge is $13/day. You can start the 24 hours whenever you want. It is not wireless in the room. I think it's a ripoff. They have a free wireless connection in the lobby. The room could have been cleaner. I noticed a spot on the wall in the shower that was there from the time I got there until I left. They also don't clean the sink thoroughly. The underside of the faucet was filthy. One thing that bothered me was how loud the doors slammed and how loud it was in the hallway during the day. I went upstairs to rest in the middle of the day and could not because of the doors slamming and housekeeping staff talking very loudly in the hall. The gym is nice, but again, another ripoff. They charge $12/day or $20/visit. I think the pool is free to use. The gym has nice equipment, and the TVs on the treadmills work well. Desk staff and concierge were helpful. The concierge was always available when I needed her. There is nothing worse than a long line at the concierge desk. She recommended some great places to eat. Two recommendations I can make: For lunch go across the street to the restaurant on the first floor of the NBC building. They have great tacos, sandwiches and salads. You can also pick up drinks, fruit, snacks, etc. It's quick, convenient and you get much more bang for your buck than at the hotel. However, I had an omelette for breakfast and didn't like it. If you like Persian food, check out Reza's on Ontario. It's a very popular place, but large so you shouldn't have too much trouble getting a table.

Despite this, check in went relativley smoothly, and we were given a Club Floor room on the 31st floor. Our room was nothing special, but fine for our purposes. We were on the South side of the hotel, and did have a great view of the Chicago River, and (between high-rises) Monroe St. Harbor and beyond it the Adler Planetarium.

Valet and in-and-out priveldges at the garage worked well. The Sheraton is probably the closest hotel to Navy Pier, and is convenient to the beach and Michigan Avenue. It is also not too far from Millennium Park, given its location on the River. My only complaint is not with the Sheraton, but with its guests. As you would expect with its proximity to Navy Pier, there were lots of children at the hotel - many of whose parents let them run unattended throughout the lobby, elevator banks, and even the Club Room. In fact, when we arrived at the hotel and got off at the 31st floor, we found ourselves in the middle of 3 brothers playing pick-up baseball (with a Cubs' souvenir) in the elevator bank.

It is a convention goers hotel mostly it seemed, as just about everyone we saw was in for a Pampered Chef convention. Honestly, these women were so loud and obnoxious, it put a damper on our stay. And they crowded the hotel no matter where you went! This may not be the hotels fault, but the size of it does draw large crowds of whatever convention is being hosted there. Just something to keep in mind. My other complaint is about the Shula's Steakhouse in the hotel. Yes, they are expensive and we were OK with that. We have been to Shula's all over the US. We enjoy the food. But the service at this location was horrible. They were exteremly snobby and obviously felt we were not spending enough money to warrant adequate service. I defintely recommend steering clear of this place! Now for the positives. LOCATION! The hotel is right on the river and in walking distance to the train station, Michigan Avenue, Clark Street, Navy Pier and the lake front. The service I thought was above average and have no complaints. We had a suite that we got for a good deal, and it was also above average. We had two adjoing rooms that gave us plenty of space. There is a restaruant on the bottom floor of the hotel, Chicago Burger Company, which we both loved and it was about 1/10 of the price of Shula's. We enjoyed beer and burgers on the riverfront outside. Very nice. Overall, I was pleasantly surpirsed with this hotel. We always stay in the Starwood brand hotels, and this is on the low end.

Parking was just under $20, but I saw an outdoor lot for cheaper and then some side street parking (if you dare.) Took a little bit to check in, and the desk forgot to give me back my credit card. I also forgot and had to go down later to get it. Took them about 25 minutes to get coordinated and figure out who might have it, but I got it back finally. The room was nice, we had a great view of the streets below and the water. The bed was very comfy and the room was fairly large...had a small couch and chair with coffee table and the bathroom was nicely appointed. We had been upgraded to a deluxe king room. I am afraid that is where the nicities end. There is relatively little soundproofing and the people next door must have had 6 people in their room. Someone was talking very loudly on a cell phone in the hallway which was easy to hear and the kids next door woke us up at 7:30. Not really a nice time to wake up when you have been out late the night before! The shower had lukewarm water at best and when we went to check out the line was horrendous. I wanted to bypass the speedy check out since I wanted to tell someone about the shower. I did receive a few extra promise points on my account, but that was not enough to make me want to stay there again. There are so many other hotels in the city, and although this one was pretty and fairly centrally located, I would rather pay a little bit more and have service, quiet, and a hot shower.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ypsilanti, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cReasonable accommodations for a relatively fair rate\u201d", "Author": "jsterben", "ReviewID": "UR5323876", "Content": "Spent two nights here on a weekend getaway in late October 2005.

For fun and to get a vastly better price, we use one of the main discount services - Priceline or Hotwire. This time around, I was fooling around with Priceline, attempting to see if I could get anything for the following day for a very cheap price. Saturday checkins with Priceline in downtown Chicago are usually a problem.... ...but not this time. I gave Priceline a shot for $66 for a 4 star and it came back with the Sheraton. $66 is not only a vast savings over the hotel's regular rate, but it's substancially cheaper than the worst hotels in downtown Chicago. The Sheraton is in a wonderful area, just a few blocks from Navy Pier, a few blocks from Michigan Ave and not that far of a walk from downtown. Fox and Obel, a wonderful grocery store, is also a block or two away. Despite the low prices that I've gotten for hotels, I go in asking things like, \"how would I feel had I paid full price?\" Things started off fine enough. Check-in was going slowly (I've visited different chain hotels in the city and I've seen check-in go faster and the staff was still welcoming.), but thankfully, there weren't many people in line and there were plenty of staff checking in. The person who checked us in was very nice and, unlike some other hotels, not only was priceline not mentioned (at some hotels, those who make cheap Priceline reservations are made to feel second class), the staff member told us about how they want every guest to be treated well and if there were any problems, to call them. I was going to try to see if I could pay for an upgrade, but didn't really have an \"in\" in the conversation. When I saw that we had a room on the 25th floor, I didn't really make an issue of it, as I figured we were far up anyway. We walked through the lobby, which was quite lovely, and went up to the floor. When we arrived, the door had been unlocked by the maid staff, who looked as if they'd just finished cleaning it (the cart was in front of the room). So, that wasn't too pleasing, and there were still also what appeared to be some breakfast room service plates (in one case, while I admittedly didn't see what the dish looked like before it was eaten, the remains didn't look too good) in the hall. The room itself, however, was pretty nice. It appeared clean, with no noticable dents in furniture or other concerns. There appeared to be some light wear (not dirt, but just wear/tear) to the bottom part of the bedspread(by the floor), but aside from that, it was fine. The room was fairly plain - not all-white plain, but certainly nothing too fancy. Size-wise, however, it was definitely pretty roomy, with a couch and a nice view. I took some great pictures out the window, which would have been nicer had the window not been dirty. The windows, while not terrible, were certainly in need of a wash. We got snacks at the Walgreens across the street, as well as at the previously mentioned Fox and Obel. We were pondering ordering room service, until we looked at the prices. Had I just ordered a burger, with gratuity (18%) and service charge ($3.25), it would have cost just under $20. Breakfast was similarly ridiculous - $19.75 (plus gratuity, plus charge, so we're talking in the neighborhood of $27 for what you can get for a fraction of the price at several different and very nice places within a half mile) for 2 eggs, meat, bread and coffee/ beverage. A pizza plate was $17 and change (and that's before gratuity), when one could easily walk to some absolutely terrific Chicago pizza places. I don't know what the Sheraton is thinking with these prices, given that there are definitely other options in the area, including PJ Clarkes across the street if you want a burger or something similar. Also food-related - there are no vending machines. They obviously want you to order one via room service or go to the gift shop. Walgreens is across the street, and both Fox and Obel and another grocery store are down the street. Get your snacks there. There's a Corner Bakery less than 1/2 a mile away, just off Michigan and across from the Wyndham hotel. Great place for a quality, fast meal if you're on the go. Air conditioning was fine, although there is the odd feature that you have to lock the door before the air conditioning can go on. Obviously, a money-saving feature so that people can't just go out and leave the AC on all day while they're gone. Definitely the first time I've ever seen anything like it at a hotel, though. We stayed at the W City Center last Summer and, interestingly enough, the room service was cheaper there - if not by a whole lot. However, the service was excellent and so was the food. Somehow I didn't think I'd have the same experience with the Sheraton, and despite the fact that the menu noted that if the food wasn't there in 30 minutes or it'd be free, given how they seemed to charge for everything in this hotel, I felt like if I did make an order and it came in 31 minutes, I'd have a debate on my hands. The bathtub did have a massaging showerhead, which seemed to work wonderfully most of the time, but sprayed all over the place on a couple of settings. The bathtub was fairly nice but - didn't drain. We were only there for one night, settled in and didn't want to sit there while someone came up and fixed it, so we just left it. When we woke up the next morning, the water was still there. The bed was one of Sheraton's relatively new Sweet Sleeper beds and, while it was not up to the W's Signature Bed (still, by far the best bed I've experienced), it was around the same quality was the Westin Heavenly Bed. Continuing the feeling like nothing was complimentary was the fact that there is a charge of one full night if you change your dates of stay after check-in (in other words, no leaving early.) and a $75 charge if you check out after noon. Internet was pretty standard at $9.95 a day, although there are a few chains now offering complimentary internet. If you emailed something at the business center with an attached document, it was $1.50 per page. The bottle water in the room was definitely not free. The list goes on. Fitness room/pool? Couldn't get a chance to check those out, because you had to sign-in at the fitness room and while apparently they didn't charge you for pool use, they do charge (I believe it's $9.95 a day?) for the fitness room and I didn't want to have to sign-in at the fitness room just to go through there to take a peek at the pool. There are a few restaurants on the premises (including the famed Shula's Steak House) and, while I would have loved to have tried room service or the restaurants just to discuss them in this review, there's a point where things are just too overpriced to \"try\". I'd have liked to have given room service a try, just to be able to discuss the service and food, but the prices were just way too high to \"try\" anything. Believe it or not, during the night, we began to hear noise from the pipes behind the bathroom. Not enough to keep us from sleeping (and I did get a good night's sleep in the Sheraton bed), but *definitely* very noticable, and it seemed like whenever the person (I'm guessing it was the room above, although it could have been next door) turned on the sink or shower, it was definitely heard. This is the first hotel we've stayed at (including some older ones) where this has been an issue. We also heard a lot of hall noise. The TV offered a pretty decent lineup of cable channels. I've seen better, I've seen worse. I've read reviews of this hotel noting that they only offered a handful of channels, but there were definitely a bit more than that. It's too bad that this hotel charges for just about everything (moreso than any other hotel I've stayed at), as it really produces a feeling in the consumer that they can't just sit back and enjoy - it's a \"don't touch anything, they might charge us\" feeling. Staff was okay. We got a good morning or two, but nothing too overly friendly, and most staff we encountered just went about their business. The final issue was check-out. The in-room system was not working (the menu would not come up, so express check-out was not possible), so we had to check out the old-fashioned way. I actually wanted to go though check-out at the desk, just to see what the service would be like. Thankfully, there wasn't much of a line. When I informed the desk clerk of the bathtub issue, he didn't seem to care a whole lot. I certainly wasn't trying to get any sort of discount or anything, I was just trying to tell him the issue. I didn't even get a \"thank you for telling us.\" In an episode of \"The Apprentice\" a couple of seasons ago, when teams had to furnish hotel rooms, Trump noted how important the last impression was. I've really felt that way when I've stayed at hotels, as well. The Sheraton didn't do that well in this regard. So, overall, for what I paid, this was a fine hotel. We got a clean, fairly spacious (if no-frills) room with a pretty good view. Given that there are definitely great views to be had from this hotel, I was really hoping for that, and certainly succeeded in that regard. Would I pay full price? No. There are other hotels in this area (including a very nice Holiday Inn a couple of blocks North - the Holiday Inn City Centre) that are cheaper and there are other hotels for the same price that are a better value. After liking the W City Center so much, I'd also consider trying the W Lakeshore, which was also in viewing distance of the Sheraton, a good 4-5 blocks N. Rating? I've seen the Sheraton rated 4 stars, and it's rated 3 1/2 by some services. Personally, I'd consider it to be a good 3-star hotel. The public areas are very nice, but the rooms were pretty comparable to the Courtyard Marriott over on Hubbard and State, which is a very nice 3 star. The Marriott service (see also the Marriott Residence Inn over by Water Tower downtown) was consistently better, as well. Would I come back? If the price was right - and by right, I mean in the range that I paid this time - I would probably consider another stay here. It's a lovely area, and very nice to stroll around.

We had booked months in advance for this conference and specifically requested and paid a deposit for a roll away bed because there were going to be 3 adults in 1 room. After arriving and registering we got to our very small room that did not have a roll away bed. When we tried to rectify the situation, I was advised that the room would never hold a roll away due to fire regulations and that the hotel does not guarantee roll aways you can only request one and they will TRY to accommodate you. (Even though we had bee charged a deposit on our credit card that included the roll away and had a stack of emails from their guest co-ordinator guaranteeing the roll away) After a 15 minute argument I asked to speak to a manager, who about 1/2 hour later called back and re-arranged our accommodations. After waiting for an hour for our new room, we were told they were very busy and would get to us when they could! On our first full day in Chicago, we attempted to find the hotel coffee shop that was mentioned in the hotel guide that's left in every room. Such a thing does not exist! You have to go to the Steak restaurant and fight off other people to get coffee/tea and whatever pastries are left over. The day I went there were only 2 bagels left at 8:30 am! (but 3 people in my party) We could not get a quick lunch any of the 5 days we were there because their grill was rarely open. One day you could buy a sac lunch from the grill........they couldn't cook anything because their computers were down (no I am not joking) Also, during our stay the lounge bar was closed for repair. Considering there were 3 conferences at the hotel that week, they should have considered holding off on the repair until they were less busy. When the repairs were finally complete, the bar was never open anyway.......no idea why. I won't even go into the fact that the carpet in the common areas was being ripped up during prime conference times! Forget about trying to get any help from the Concierge. I've never med a ruder set of service staff. We had driven to CHicago and were interested in exploring some of the outlying areas......I thought the Concierge was going to have a heart attack! He refused to help us and could not understand why we didn't want to eat at a restaurant w/in walkind distance. He insisted we take his walking guide and would not provide a map of Chicago. As an aside, between my friends and I, we put in 5 requests for the Chicago travel guide several months before our trip and we received 1 guide a week or so after our return.

My sister also stayed there, in a separate room, so I have two sets of experiences to draw upon. This will be long, because I want it to be useful. First, this hotel is obviously pitched at running conventions, and it does that pretty well. The facilities are generally good, with comfortable seating, good AV equipment and so forth. One thing which I really appreciated was the availability of big containers of chilled, filtered water at the back of each convention room, with a seemingly limitless supply of big plastic cups. What can I say, the cups impressed me. On the downside, some of the convention rooms were small and stuffy and the airconditioning seemed not to be working. One excellent panel lost a number of audience members who just could not hack the heat in the room. After a particuarly unpleasant session in one room, I avoided all further panels in that room, and I felt bad for the speakers who had made an effort to develop their presentation and fly across the country to provide it. Generally speaking, though, the convention facilities were good; I was attending a crime fiction convention, and a religious charity was holding a separate convention at the same time, and there were no overlaps, double bookings or similar confusion. Check-in was excellent, considering the enormous queue of conventioneers waiting when we arrived, and I was impressed at how quickly we were all processed. Our receptionist, Erika, was courteous and helpful. Check out was similarly smooth and quick for my sister; again this was impressive given the length (and post-party exhaustion) of the queue. I did not have to check out as the hotel offers a service to some guests of putting a bill under your door and if you don't dispute it then you don't need to check out. Mine was accurate so I did not check out, but I have no idea why I was offered this facility and not my sister. A few days later a charge appeared on my credit card for the mini-bar items I had consumed; this also was perfectly fair and accurate. Rooms - like the curate's egg; good in parts. I had a corner room on the 18th floor, which was slighly odd in its configuration and wasted a lot of space, but it had a sofa under the window which looked out onto a view of the lake, which was gorgeous, and a lovely place to curl up and read. My sister had a corridor room, which seemed, at least, to be a lot bigger. Her wardrobe was twice the size of mine. The wardrobes contain a small lockable safe (a key safe, not the more usual modern PIN safes) and an iron and ironing board. Despite having asked for a non-smoking room, my room reeked of smoke. I considered asking for a new one, but (a) the check-in queues were very long; (b) it was convenient being near my sister and (c) I was jetlagged and tired, so I didn't bother. To be fair, I'm sure they would have accommodated me had I asked. The room generally was pleasant and well-appointed. The bed was huge and crisp and comfortable and the best thing about the place. There was a big TV on a console which contained a chest of drawers on the one side, and a minibar and fridge on the other. My TV faced the bed directly and could be moved to watch from the couch. My sister's TV was some distance from the bed, a bit too far for comfortable viewing, but also on an angle if viewing from the couch. But then we weren't there to watch TV. There was a good desk and chair with an internet modem which I did not use so can't comment on. The sofa is comfortable enough if you borrow a cushion from the bed for your back (and there are plenty). As mentioned, the view from this part of the building (Room 1852) is just great. As is common in hotel rooms, the lighting is pretty poor. Why is that? Also, there were two a/c units in my room, only one of which worked, and that one was only operable when, for some unfathomable reason, the deadlock was latched. This means that if you want to nip out for an hour then you can't let the room cool down in your absence. That struck me as pretty cheap for a four-star hotel. There was also a sizeable hole in the wall behind the door where it had obviously been struck by the doorknob once too often. My sister's room, 1850, had almost as good a view, and was larger. It suffered, however, from being next to the staircase, which has metal steps, and was therefore pretty noisy. Avoid the rooms either side of the stairs, and also the room next to the ice machine on each level, which makes a massive racket. The small fridge was crammed full of minibar items. There was no room for anything else, and in hindsight I wish I had asked Housekeeping to take it all away. I did consume a few items, water & juice, and was surprised that these were not replenished throughout the four days of my stay. But at least it made room for a few grocery items. The minibar prices were on the high side even by the usual extortionate minibar standards. On that note, the ice machine had been removed from our floor, and some work was obviously going on, but was not completed over the four day period. This led to much traipsing up and down stairs. I discovered that several other ice machines were not in working order. When I found one that was, two floors up, it made a lot of noise. I would not want to be sleeping next to that. My sister's room was next to the stairs, which had metal steps, and a lot of traffic due to people climbing up and down at all hours looking for a functional ice machine. So I'd stay away from rooms next to stairs or ice dispensers. The bathroom was pretty decent, with a nice bath and decent towel supply. The amenities were throughly ordinary, though - only no-name soap, shampoo and conditioner - and like the minibar, were not refreshed during the four day stay. By the third day you could find conventioneers knocking on each others' doors asking if anyone had any soap. (Though, strangely, the three free magazines which were placed next to the TV were replaced on the first day of the month with new editions). We went to the nearby Walgreen's for bath gel etc. And again, the bathroom lighting is not great. For some peculiar reason there is a coffee percolator on the wall next to the hairdryer, and a supply of coffee, sugar etc on the vanity. That did not seem very sanitary to me. The real disappointment in this hotel is the service. At check in and in brochures etc much is made of the \"Sheraton Promise\" and the \"Promise Desk\" - which is the concierge desk, and which irritatingly is often unattended and just gives you a message that cutely says they can't help you because they're fulfilling a promise to some one else. Grrr. A few examples: -One of the first things I do upon settling into a hotel room is to have a good browse in the services folder to find out what amenities and facilities the hotel offers. On this occasion all but two of the pages in the folder had been removed. I called for a new one and was told it would be right up. Half an hour later I called again (I wanted to order room service!) and ten minutes later a guy arrived at the door. He looked like a member of the janitorial staff and spoke not much English. He offered me a new folder, but when I tried to give him the first folder he got quite angry and kept saying \"They are same! They are same!\" Eventually to calm him down I had to open the first folder and show him the pages missing, as he could not understand what I was telling him. That was a pretty unpleasant introduction to the hotel service. -The material in the folder was, in any event, out of date. I spent 45 minutes looking for the coffee stand mentioned in the folder before I found someone who could tell me it no longer existed, but I could get espresso from the steakhouse. This seemed to be news to the steakhouse, where someone took my order for a double strength latte and disappeared for 15 minutes before eventually returning with a weak, double-*sized* latte. When I explained that I wanted a short, strong coffee, not a huge weak one, I was told I had to pay full price whether the cup was full or not. I was pretty offended by this, because I could not care less about an extra dollar, I just wanted a strong coffee, not a big (weak) one. -The room service menu is quite limited and *very* expensive ($40 +, plus service and tax for a steak), but on the first night I ordered a hamburger. It took a while to arrive, and was plain and dry. Although on the menu it said it came with two types of cheese, there was no cheese at all on it. When I rang and asked about this they said because I did not specify which cheese I wanted, they just left it off. I said that (a) no one had asked me what type of cheese I wanted; and (b) the menu suggested you got both types, not a choice. They grumpily asked what I wanted them to do about it, and because I could not be bothered waiting for a fresh hamburger, I said an adjustment to my bill would do, to which they said \"OK\". In the event I was not charged for this at all. My sister, co-incidentally, ordered a hamburger also, and also received no cheese, *plus* she was given opened and used condiment bottles, which was just disgusting. She had also complained, but was not offered anything. -On my third day I put some shirts in for laundering. It took three phone calls over an hour before someone collected them. They were supposed to be back by 6pm. I was in the room between 4.30pm and 6.30 pm and they were not delivered. I had to go out then, and I got back at 10pm. My shirts had still not been delivered. I rang the \"promise desk\". Three times. Over an hour. Finally they turned up at around 11pm. When I rang the promise desk and said this was unacceptable, the shirts had been promised by 6pm, they were totally uninterested but said they wouldn't charge me. I would rather have paid and had them on time. -Doormen - as someone else has observed, there were squads of them standing about, but they never seemed to offer any assistance to anyone. We had to find the town car we ordered ourselves in the throng of people leaving, and the driver did all the work with the luggage. -Business Centre - internet access is outrageously expensive, at 60 cents a minute, and limited - there are only about three machines, and they won't let you book one but want you to hang about until one is free. Also, we tried to post something from their mail centre, and after long and protracted negotiations discovered that they can only send things by courier, and even then, not overseas, which was useless to us. There is a cash machine in the lobby, though, which is useful. Overall I was massively unimpressed by the so-called Sheraton Promise, which seemed to amount to \"we won't give you good service, but when you complain we'll cancel the charge\". I for one would rather have a decent service at a fair price. There was absolutely no interest in improving the service or working out where it was failing. Pluses - the location is great; a short walk from everything, and views to boot. In particular the Pier is very close. Because the in-hotel dining is expensive and in my view mediocre quality, I recommend you walk a block or two to the fabulous Fox & Obel grocery and deli where you can get magnificent pre-prepared meals, some inexpensive, some not ($10 each for lump crab cakes, but they were seriously the absolute best I've ever tasted). You can also get milk, snacks and staples at the Walgreen's a block from the hotel (visible across the carpark from the main entrance). We also ate several times at the Lucky Strike cafe in the AMF centre opposite the hotel - great food at good prices. Chicago's a fabulous city and I had a much better time than this exhaustive review perhaps suggests. The rooms are basically comfortable and well appointed, the location is great, and if you're going to a fun convention like mine then you'll have a good time here. It will help considerably if you do not pay anything close to full price for rooms, lower your expectations drastically on the level of service you should get in a four-star hotel, and don't bother to eat here. On your first day go and get what you need for a comfortable stay from Walgreens and Fox & Obel. If you do use hotel services and are unhappy, ask for a refund because you will get one much more easily than you will get decent service.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3903012", "Content": "I was there on business, but had time for R&R as well.

Can't really be better for experiencing downtown Chicago. Short walk to Navy Pier, Mag Mile, etc. My family and I pulled up and were helped quickly at the curb. I was advised on what to do for parking considering I would need my car later for a trip to Soldier Field for a soccer game. $35 for in and out privalege parking. Pretty high, but that is Chicago. Lobby is beautiful and the front desk staff (there weren't enough of them) were friendly and helpful. We were put on the 25th floor. The rooms are pretty small with two VERY soft, overly soft, insanely soft, beds. Two bottles of water were on the table waiting for us (if we wanted to pay $4 / bottle!), and an in-room refridge filled with stuff (like $4 for a KitKat and such). Sadly, after the soccer game I had had no dinner. It was late and I did not want to walk miles for food. You got it. $18 for a Rueben through room service. When I asked if there was a restaurant in which we could dine rather than use room service I was unable to understand the reply, although I asked her to repeat twice. Hiring people who speak English would help. When we went to bed (you know, the too soft beds) my eldest son and I sweated to death because you sank into the bed so far that heat had no way to escape. If you are a warm body person, you will HATE these beds. The air conditioning was not terribly cool either so it just made it that much worse. We visited the pool which was nice, but crowded (we were told this is an all day long ordeal) The sun Deck is beautiful too. The next morning I decided to take advantage of the incredible workout facilities listed on their website. I planned on running on the treadmill while my wife swam with the kids. (I run every morning on a treadmill at home, so this selling point on their website was a big selling point for ME) I signed my family in to the pool and then went over to the treadmills and started my warm up. I was then approached by a female employee who told me, in no uncertain terms, that I needed to pay to use the workout facilites. $15 to be precise. Incredulous, I asked her to show me where it says that there is a charge. She said, there just is. I checked the website again and it says NOTHING about the extra charges. Essentially, I spent $200 for one night and was KICKED out of the health club. I went back to the room while my wife and kids swam. While reading the paper I got the stench of cigarette smoke from the ventilation system. I am an ex-smoker so this is rather distressing for me. Not sure where it came from, but really don't care either. For $200 a night I expect to not leave my room smelling like I spent the night in a brothel. Long and short of it is that it is a very nice hotel with some nice people working there. Worth $200 / night? No way. Won't do that again.

Negatives: Bed was uncomfortable, despite all of their bragging about how great the beds are--it was so springy it felt like sleeping on a trampoline. The comforter is so unbelievably heavy that it is too uncomfortable to sleep with (plus did not seem too clean & is made of some microfiber material that feels grungy), but then all you have to sleep with is a sheet (threadbare cotton with holes in it) and a yucky brown thermal blanket. They don't even put a second sheet on top of the blanket to make it more sanitary. Also, the deadbolt has to be closed to activate the heating/cooling system, so you cannot leave the air conditioning on when you leave the room. By the time I got back to the room after a long day out, the room was hot & stuffy. Also, they don't even give shower caps in the bathrooms--it is bare bones minimum with the toiletries.

To all those who gave a poor review of the hotel, all I can say is that if you want a 5 star hotel at a 4 star price, then best of luck to you. Beginning at the front doors, the valet service was more than plentiful, and polite, (which can be hard to come by in large cities) and completely accommodating to us, as we wanted to park the car ourselves. The price for parking was $24 for 24 hours, but that seemed average for the entire city. In the lobby in the Sheraton Chicago, you'll see a large, romantically lit dome over the lounge chairs. Modern-looking waterfall fountains dot the escalator area, which you'll walk by in order arrive at the elevators. Upon entering your suite, you'll find a simple room, with the basic TV armoire, the bed of your choice, and in our case, an outstanding view. We could see the John Hancock building poking over the top of skyline with Lake Michigan in all its glory off to the East. The bathroom, again, was basic, but had a very pretty, deep maroon wallpaper with a white marble sink and countertop. At night the scenery was amazing, and I was happy to be able to get some great nighttime pictures with my new camera. The Sheraton is a place I will frequent on my trips to the Windy City.

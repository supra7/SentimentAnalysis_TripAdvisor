The hotel is older and has been remodeled; however, the bathrooms are very clean but small. A coffee maker with coffee and tea was available in the bathroom, along with plenty of complimentary bath items (shampoo, lotion, etc.) The rooms are a bit cozier than I am used to, especially for this class of hotel, but they were well-appointed with new furnishings and bedding. The beds are ultra-comfortable and extra pillows were already in the room when we arrived.

My room was on the top (11th) floor, directly across from the elevators and very small, just large enough for a queen bed (most rooms, judging by the floor plan, are larger). The worst thing, though, was there was an intermittent rattling/rustling noise in the ceiling over my room. I thought it was mechanical; the hotel staff said they thought it was a trapped bird and promised to do something about it. They said they were completely full and couldn't move me to another room. The noise persisted for my three-night stay. It didn't keep me awake at night, but it was annoying. Aside from that, the room was very clean, bedding was comfortable, the bathroom was small but nice, internet and long distance were free if you are a Wyndham by request member. I stayed at the Anatole next door a year ago and I would definitely stay there instead. I would also say, if you're like me and like to walk, don't stay in Market Center at all. It is nearly impossible to walk anywhere in this industrial/warehouse area up against a busy freeway.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR401197908", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Steve0296"}, {"Content": "Decent hotel, but nothing to do nearby This hotel was fine for business travel - the room was an ok size and nicely furnished (although the bathroom was tiny).

A few of the previous posts refer to this property as a \u9225\u6e13uxury\u9225?property and that\u9225\u6a9a not even close to being true. While the public areas in this hotel are quite nice the rooms fall short of that description. First of all, the rooms are very small and the bathroom was extremely tiny. So tiny, in fact that only one person could be in there at a time and even then it was difficult to turn around without hitting your arm on something. The ceiling was so low that my husband (he\u9225\u6a9a 6\u9225?3\u9225? only had about 3 inches of clearance above his head and practically had to bend over to use the shower head. On top of that, our tub didn\u9225\u6a9b drain properly so by the end of our shower, we were standing in a decent amount of water. There was a strand of hair in our clean towels and the washcloths were so thin you could see your fingers through them and one of them even had a few small holes in it. The floors were old and cracked and there were a few spots in the walls and floors of the bathroom that desperately needed caulking. The door knob looked that it had been removed and when it was replaced they left a space between the hole and the handle so you could see through it to the room (sure it was only about an inch wide but come on, I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b even expect to see this at a two star property). There were also a ton of scratches on the door like someone had had to claw their way out. The d\u8305cor in the room was nice but there wasn\u9225\u6a9b even an enclosed closet. The closet was a bar set up right inside the door with a few hangers. I can\u9225\u6a9b tell you the last time I was at a property that didn\u9225\u6a9b even have a true closet. On top of that the walls were so thin you could hear the conversations of the guests in the next room. One morning I was treated to a business phone call and the next night I got to hear a drunken man talk to his family. Talk about a real treat! One of the light bulbs needed replacing and the clock was set for the wrong time. Instead of showing 6 a.m., it showed 6 p.m. which meant the alarm didn\u9225\u6a9b go off the first morning we were there. I realize all of these seem like insignificant issues but when you\u9225\u6a99e confronted with all of them in a short time period, they definitely add up.The service at this property was about half and half\u9225\ue6cealf was great and the other half just average. The food we got from room service for lunch one day was really good and our service was fantastic. However, the next morning our experience wasn\u9225\u6a9b quite as good. We needed directions a few times during our stay and each time we were given impeccable directions and were given service with a smile.

We normally don't stay in motels, but my wife and I decided to give it a shot. However, upon checking in, we were dissapointed and decided to hunt around for another hotel. For only twenty dollars more (80 dollars a night) we found the Wyndham Market Center right next door. Wow!! This is simply the best hotel bargain I've ever seen. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are very nice. I have stayed in hotels that were double the price that weren't as nice. The rooms are what you would expect from a $150.00+ a night room. I find the Wyndham Anatole (right near this hotel) to be a gargantuan monstrosity. If you are looking for a smaller cozy luxury hotel that won't break the bank in Dallas this is the real deal.

Stay at the Anatole I book events in upwards of forty hotels per year. I am committed that my attendees have an extraordinary experience, so I aim for 4 diamond properties, but due to availability, I sometimes have to settle for 3 diamond. I have been to many an excellent 3 diamond. This was certainly not one of them. My customers had an extraordinary experience, all right. Extraordinarily lousy!When I arrived I was informed that the hotel was oversold and that 30% of my customers (all of whom had reservations) were to be bumped to another hotel, a 2 diamond next door. Okay, so these things sometimes happen. What upset me, though, is that I later discovered that the hotel had known of the situation 3 weeks earlier and, although I was in weekly contact with them, I was never informed of the problem. Had I been so informed I could have made arrangements with the Hotel next door (which is owned by a friend of mine) to at least have gotten my customers into their recently renovated rooms. As it was, they ended up in the last remaining rooms, and I got complaints from every single one of the bumped.I was at the front desk as 6 of my attendees were trying to check in. They were told, with no explanation, that they would have to stay elsewhere and they were understandably upset. The front desk staff clearly had no training whatsoever in communication and customer service. I had to step in to explain and apologize for the situation.As for the next two days, the hotel never did perform in a way that would redeem itself in my eyes.I am actually shocked that the Wyndham Anatole next door (a fabulous hotel) doesn't lobby to have the Wyndham flag taken away from this sad excuse for a hotel.", "Date": "Apr 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR682466566", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Seattle_planner"}, {"Content": "Gutes Hotel in guenstiger Lage mit gutem Fruehstueck   showReview(17446464, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR200195926", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98693-r21759628-Wyndham_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "98693", "Price": "$109"}}

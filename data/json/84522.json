I had heard good things about the hotel and had made reservations. Don't be fooled: this places treats its guests horribly. Despite having a reservation, I was told upon arrival that the hotel was overbooked -- why hadn't they told me before? why no email, no phone call? why was there no manager available to answer these questions? I was then put in a taxi after midnight to be transported to what turned out to be a lower-grade hotel many miles away. Hotel Angeleno picked up the tab, but I found myself in a room that smelled of smoke with paper-thin walls. I then had to transport myself back to Hotel Angeleno for my second night in town (all my meetings were nearer to this location). I found the accommodations to be decent, but management took a long while to return my calls that day and chose not discount my night at the hotel, when it seemed to me they ought to consider it. I have since heard from others that the hotel may overbook its rooms as a practice. I don't think I'll be staying there again and discourage you from doing so, too.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "TX", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than expected\u201d", "Author": "HanaleimomTx", "ReviewID": "UR126296536", "Content": "After reading the review here I was prepared for the worse. I booked my room through priceline.com and knew that I don't have a choice of view. I requested a room facing the back and was given one on 10th floor, on the side. At check in I have the option to upgrade to higher floor for extra $. I don't recall but maybe it was $25/night. From my room, direct view was the building behind the hotel. Staning on the right side of the balcony I could see part of the freeway. With the glass door closed, we weren't bother with the noises. Units are equipped with individual AC units w/o auto temperature shut-off. You must turn on and off manually. No problem for us. There was some noise from the unit but it turned out to be white noise for us. There was no closet but a small armoire is provided next to the TV. The fridge was filled with items available for purchase so you can't use it to store your own items. There was a small in-room safe large enough to store my 13\" Macbook. Water pressure was not very strong in my opinion. As others have posted here besides the hotel's restaurant there is eating establishments within walking distance. However, the hotel provides shuttle services to close by areas until 7 PM, I believe. On the plus sides the room was clean and bed was firm. Their toiletry items have beautiful scents. There is mint thyme hair wash, yuzu bergamot creme rinse and lavender lime moisturizer. The exercise room was adequate with a treadmill, stair machine, elliptical, all-purpose weight machine and free weight equipment. The fireplace by the pool is nice to sit by at night. We did not use the pool because the weather was cool. Complimentary wine hour was available from 5:30 to 6:30 where white and red wine are served next to the lobby area. West restaurant turned out to be much better than I expected. Menu items were creative and beautifully presented. Expect to pay $15 and up per entree for dinner. We thought the food was worth it. I like their appetizer \"braised pork\", Loup de Mer (entree: seabass with small round-cut potato). Internet and parking were free. Overall the valet service was very efficient with a few instances where the wait was more than 5 minutes due to high occupancy one night. We met the manager and hotel chef Mathew Woolfe. Both are very nice. Overall, I think free internet, free parking, complimentary wine hour, clean room and complimentary shuttle make up for its location.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class Ecperience\u201d", "Author": "drdon555", "ReviewID": "UR126154584", "Content": "Had a great stay at the Angeleno.

Pros: Close to UCLA; close to Manny's Pizzeria, which delivers, and has fabulous food. Con's: 1. VERY NOISY. It is sandwiched between Sunset Blvd. and the 405 freeway. If you want to open the window you have to listen to traffic. 2. Customer service was inconsistent. When I called and asked for a feather free room, I was told it wasn't a problem at all. Booked the room. When I arrived a week later after having surgery, the lady at the front desk acted as if I was speaking another language. First I was told they can only remove the feather bedding from certain rooms, and my room wasn't one of them. Then she put me in a room right over the freeway. I requested to move rooms, got a slightly quieter room, but she would not have the feathers removed. I finally stayed in the room and consequently woke up with surgery pain and a massive sinus headache. Yet, when I checked out, they couldn't understand why I wasn't given what I requested. 3. The restaurant was VERY EXPENSIVE. The buffet breakfast didn't exist, and you had to drive to go anywhere else. 4. The refrigerator in the room is jam packed with alcohol and drinks, leaving you no where to put your own refrigerated items. Overall, I would not stay here again.

It\u2019s right on the 405, with crazy easy access to, well, pretty much every business district in LA, save Burbank. The hotel is lovely, and the parking is free for guests. The people are very nice in the lobby, the restaurant and everywhere else on the property. Extremely accommodating. The best part is the balcony off every single room; one of the most obvious ways to make a hotel more enjoyable. The downsides to the Angeleno are limited, though you best be aware of them before you book a room:1. Though convenient, it does stink to be ON America\u2019s most popular commuting freeway. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re in an island surrounded by traffic noise. Not terribly inviting to take a stroll. 2. The walls are not particularly sound proof. Were you the unfortunate neighbor of a snorer or an amorous couple, you\u2019ll either need to don your ear plugs or open your sliding door to the drowning properties of traffic noise. 3. The restaurant is fine. Fine as in \u201cpassable\u201d for a Joie de Vivre property. Not stellar, or even especially anything, other than high above the 405.

Yes, It is on the 405 (where there is always notorious LA traffic) but, the grounds are clean, trendy and well groomed. Free parking for hotel guest and an extremely helpful staff. The beds were extremely comfortable with high count linens. I suggest getting a low level room facing the pool. There is less noise and you are able to utilize the baclony a bit more. I Highly suggest getting breakfast (from room service) It was amazingly fresh and delicious!!! What keeps this property from being a 5 star aside from the noise on the 405 is the bathroom. If you are staying with someone you are not comfortable with, than your in trouble. There is no door for the sink/vanity area and the door for the tub/toilet is pretty clear.

Through Booking.com we had requested a room on the west side, which would presumably give a view of the Pacific and be a lot quieter, but to no avail. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful: two calls to the desk regarding problems with the television had someone at the door literally within two minutes, and they were promptly dealt with. At dinner in the restaurant the manager stopped to chat and, on hearing that we were going to the Getty the next day, he went off and arranged shuttle transport both ways for us. The next night we were taken to Westwood Village, so the car never left the garage, where the parking is (quite exceptionally for California in my experience) free.

That hotel was dismal and we ended up making last minute reservations at the Angeleno. We arrived at the hotel before they received our reservations from Travelocity but they just confirmed the reservation through my email and immediately accommodated us. Everyone was really friendly and the checkout process was easy. The rooms are smaller but nice. It is louder if you have a room facing the 405 but we're from Chicago so the noise lulls us to sleep. The room was very clean as well as are the entire grounds. Everyone we came across was happy and eager to help. During our trip I hit a trailer with my rental car which tore part of the bumper off of it and left the fender completely black (on a white car). It appeared to need repainting. On our last day there one of the valet employees asked what I did and I told him. About 20 minutes later I come out to get the car, he pulls it up, gets out and says \"it took me a little bit but I got it\". Confused, I asked him what he got. He signals me to come over and he had buffed out the entire fender, leaving behind just a few minor scratches from the accident. The rental company didn't even notice that the car had been in an accident. I felt bad because I only had $5 to tip the valet but we'll get him the next time around. That was really cool and he didn't have to do that. That said, my biggest gripe with hotels like these is valet parking. I'm in and out plenty throughout the day and even though parking is free, you have to tip the valet drivers on each dropoff/ pickup. Not that I don't want to tip them. They should be tipped but when you're in/ out 5 - 6 times a day it ends up not only being more expensive than most hotel's self park fees but also more inconvenient. The hotel has a decent size parking lot out back that could easily accommodate self parking for those who desire. I wish that was something they offered, even at a nominal fee.

Arriving at the hotel for a two night stay we found free valet parking, with drop-off right outside the lobby. Check-in was pleasant and the young lady seemed genuinely interested in making sure we knew where everything was. She also invited us to a free wine reception that evening. The hotel layout is slightly unusual because of the round tower construction. Our room was pleasant but it did have an un-aired smell on arrival. It wasn\u2019t a huge room but quite big enough. It had a nice desk and a big comfortable bed. The bathroom was quite adequate too. The room also had a small balcony but it was too small to be of any real use apart from taking a quick look at the view.

There was also free wifi Internet, though no wired access. We went down to the lobby for a couple of glasses of complementary wine, which was nice. Slightly more social people than us might have chatted to some other guests and made new friends. We used the time to wander around with our wine and check out the pool area. It seemed nice, with lots of places to relax and the pool was large enough for a short swim. There\u2019s also a fitness suite. We ate in the top-floor restaurant and it was very good. I had a shellfish medley dish that was excellent. The wine was good too. The view is out over the highway and on to downtown LA. We also ate breakfast here and that was good too. There were a few minor niggles during our stay: Tea seems to be a scarce resource here. There is none in the room and when I called the lobby for some they said I couldn\u2019t have any. Room service carefully gave out one tea bag and even the restaurant only provided one teabag with breakfast. My wife continued to insist there was a stale smell to the room and/or towels during our stay, though I couldn\u2019t detect it.

The rooms are great, very comfy, have everything you might need, and don't overstock with things you don't. The beds are comfortable and linens are white and clean. Bathrooms are nice, if slightly small. In-room coffee maker, hair dryer, bath products, extra towels, mini-bar items, etc are all as expected. Some rooms have a tub and others a shower only, so if you're a soaker just make sure to mention that when reserving a room. Every room I have stayed in has a balcony and that is something I absolutely LOVE in a hotel - the weather in LA is one if its best selling points and being able to enjoy that while in room is a definite luxury. The restaurant on the top floor of the hotel, West, is amazing. The waitstaff and sommelier were all very knowledgeable and helpful, and suggested some amazing pairings I never would have known to try. The food is fresh and delicious and expertly prepared. I ended up having almost a custom meal, just because I was willing to ask questions and try different options. I even got a complimentary breakfast sent to my room after dining there the evening before, just to thank me for being a happy customer. Now that is pretty awesome service if you ask me.

As time goes on, the hotel begins to feel as though it is part of a movie set and is not actually run by trained employees. The rooms are decent, but small. A narrow armoire serves as a \"closet,\" so storage space was limited. The bathroom was divided oddly into two sections, sink area and toilet/shower. But the door to the toilet/shower area is glass and very see-through. There is no door between the bedroom and the bathroom entry where the sink is. Therefore, there is no privacy at all. Among the 8 of us staying at the Angeleno that weekend, we all agreed that was a very strange design choice and made things awkward. Not everyone sharing rooms is on such an intimate level with their travel partner that using the toilet behind glass should feel natural. We called for room service and it rang indefinitely. Many menu items were not available. Pool towels were mysteriously missing one day, and no one was around to fetch them. The poor woman in the coffee shop was our go-to person for everything, and she barely knew how to run the coffee shop. Many coffee items on the menu seemed beyond her capability. Ingredients had run out or were not available. The smoothie mixer was broken, or required mix that they didn't have on hand. The one place where things work well is the valet station. Those guys run a good operation, which can be tricky at the intersection of Sunset, the 405 and Church Street under repair. Bravo to those guys who bring the cars up and down. They are always there, always friendly. If you stay there, ask for a room on the side facing away from the highway. The noise is very loud. Staying higher up in the building might help also, but then you contend with the super slow elevators. We tended to use the stairs since we were on Level 6. The beds are comfortable, with nice clean linens. That is worth a lot in my book! In general the room was clean. The location is convenient to Westwood, Brentwood, Palisades, and parts of Santa Monica. Beverly Hills is not too far, although traffic made it slow. Despite all of my observations being pretty critical, I have hope that the kinks can be worked out. I hope the Joie de Vivre company reads guest reviews.

The building itself looks a little incongruous being in a cylindrical configuration and is in somewhat of a no man's land. However, it is well served for road access being next door to entry and exit ramps for I405 (there is construction at the interchange which effects traffic patterns, and one ramp is closed at nights). The room was above average size with a comfortable king bed, work desk, full length closet and a mini bar / refrigerator. There was both WiFi and Ethernet complimentary broadband access in the room; the WiFi was satisfactory but I couldn't get the Ethernet to connect. The desk surface was large enough to be able to work comfortably on. Although there were numerous power outlets in the room few of them were convenient to the desk. There was only one useful outlet close to the desk, near the floor. Under the desk there was an additional outlet but hidden behind a rats nest of communication wiring. We ended up with devices on the bedside table and in the bathroom in order to charge them. The bathroom was large with a single sink, toilet and shower. The shower was a walk-in type and looked as if it could have been converted from a tub configuration. Water pressure and temperature was good. Lighting was fluorescent but was adequate. The room provided an ironing board and iron, a safe (which I didn't' use), hair dryer and a coffee maker. The room overlooked I405, noise from which was discernible at night but not uncomfortably so. The air conditioning unit was more obtrusive, largely I think because I don't travel much any longer and so I'm unused to an AC unit. The staff were accommodating, pleasant and efficient, Parking is complimentary but requires the use of a valet service, we never waited more than two minutes for our car. Unlike other Joie de Vivre hotels we have stayed in breakfast is not complimentary. One can either use the restaurant or they have a cafe with muffins and croissants. We didn't partake of breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment, although the cafe offerings didn't look particularly inspiring. We eat dinner at the hotel one night and it was excellent, much better than usual hotel restaurant fare and it was reasonably priced. Another surprise was that it was busy. Although the hotel is somewhat isolated from services such as shops and restaurants, Brentwood Village is 0.6 miles down Sunset Blvd. and there is a sidewalk between the hotel and the village for anyone wanting a little exercise.

The check in process was smooth and it\u2019s always nice when your room is ready upon check in.

Having worked in the hotel business for 12 years, I knew that she was going to be charged for the room as well so I was adamant that it was just for incidentals and the front desk agent said it was. The room was small but nice. The TV was extremely fussy and when I called down to the front desk I was told that that was the way all the TVs were in the hotel which I found out was a lie since I went down to my mom\u2019s room and the picture was crystal clear. The bathroom was small and the shower had no door which led to a nice flooding situation every time we showered. The following morning we asked for a 3 extra sets of towels since we had used most of them the night before getting ready for the wedding. They sent up 2 wash cloths and it took another 30 minutes to get the other towels sent up. While driving back home that day we received a call from the mother of the bride wanting to know why we were not at the brunch that morning. We explained that we knew nothing about it.

No room for the suitcases, and the wardrobe is too small. We hope they'll do something in the wash area concerning the lighting. If you're a woman (or man) and trying to put on make-up, bring a lighted mirror. No full length mirror, either! That's bad when you're dressing for a formal event. And the TV blocks the mirror behind the bureau. Our party was sharing two rooms. Both ran out of tissues and toilet paper which weren't replaced, even after the tissue box was turned upside down so that the room attendant would take note. Also, our rooms went unmade for an entire day until we let it be known we had to start getting ready for the evening's events. To top it off, the restaurant is super expensive with few menu selections.

The pool was heated and the fireplace was a great place to sit outside on chilly evenings. The location is a little strange because it is right on the highway -- away from other hotels, returants and attractions. But, a five minute drive to Westwood or Brentwood was easy. Plus, Beverly Hills was close as well. The reviewers that described the rooms as loud from traffic noise must have been sleeping with the door open. It was really loud outside on the balcony, but I couldn't even hear it in the room. They did a great job soundproofing the glass. While on this same trip we spent one night at the Sheraton Universal, I suspect these buildings were buit at about the same time. But, the remodel of the Hotel Angeleno was far superior. They paid attention to all of the interior details. For example, the bathroom doors didn't have 15 layers of paint like a lot of older hotels do. They proabaly completely gutted the interior because the finishes were all neat and fresh.

Of course, I had pushed too many buttons at once on the t.v., and couldn't get my movie started, so I called downstairs and the Rooms Divison Manager, Scott, sent someone up immediately. Ben the engineer showed up within 5 minutes and fixed my issue. When was the last time you were at a hotel, got a manager on the phone and an issue was solved within 5 minutes?! I felt really good about my choice to stay at the Angeleno! Great customer service, great rate, and wait until I tell you about dinner...! I went upstairs to WEST Restaurant on the 17th floor, where I was seated by Eileen, at a table where I watched the sunset from their 180 degree views. Beautiful! Any table at WEST is really good since there are so many windows. You can see from Beverly Hills out to the beaches, it's very cool at night with all of the lights, and the bar area looks like it's out of a magazine. Our very attentive waiter made some suggestions as to what to try, (forgive me, I forgot your name, but you were so good and your service was A++++), I started with THE best caesar salad I have every had, hands down! The dressing was so yummy. Then, I had the most incredibly juicy filet (cue: mouth watering), asparagus, and for dessert (I couldn't resist!) a molten lava chocolate cake with strawberries and some ice cream. Our busboy (who I understand won \"Employee of the Month\") was fabulous, too. I wish I could eat like that every night!!! Such a lovely dinner, and the food and service was truly excellent. The next morning, I ordered up breakfast and asked how long it might be before it would be up to the room? I was told \"30 minutes or less\". Twenty minutes later, there was a knock on my door and Pedro brought in a great breakfast! Eggs, chicken apple sausage, potatoes, fruit, and a bagel, and some deeeelish fresh squeezed OJ.

I tried to check in early, and was told that there were no quieter rooms available until 3pm, only to be given at 3pm the room which must have been the closest to the freeway. I asked to change rooms, which they did. The door handle on the new room you had to push up rather than pull down. However the bill I received on checking out was $18 per day higher for the first 2 nights, and $38 for the third night.

Yes the hotel was right next to the freeway, but apart from a little noise i cant say this ruined our stay, although there were no \"this is the view from our room photos!\" The room was, as some have highlighted ,small and a little dark and dated. In hindsight i should of maybe asked if there was another room, but it was perfectly fine, clean and comfortable. The room was ready at check in. The only thing that we found was off putting was that there were swimming lessons held at the hotels pool. These lessons lasted most of the afternoon. This i know put me and another guest off from swimming as we had to avoid the lession and feel embarrassed when you over hear the children ask \"coach \" why were we in there!. The staff at the hotel were overall fantastic (depending who you ask, one obviously had not bothered to check on something) and go out of their way to help.

Before we left we had contacted the hotels we were staying at to inform them of our special occassion. This hotel had said they would pass on our details to the 'guest experience team' and they looked forward to our arrival. That was the end of that however and when we mentioned at the front desk it was our honeymoon we were congratulated only. We were not expecting anything grand but to have been sent an e- mail implying otherwise, it was a bit disappointing. We cannot fault the room as it was very comfortable and the bed was one of the comfiest we have slept in a hotel. The room and hotel overall was very clean as well. The location of his hotel is not ideal and is not withing walking distance of anything which became a pain. The hotel did lay on a complimnetary shuttle bus service which ran every half hour between the Getty Centre, and 2 local villages; Westwood and Brentwood. This bus however needed to be booked in advance, which was fair enough, however if someone else had booked in for the time you were wanting you could not also book in. The bus sat around 8 people, which didn't make sense to us as if there were a family of 4 booked it for Brentwood at 6pm then there would be 4 available seats on the bus but if we wanted to go to Brentwood at 6pm we couldn't as the bus was already booked, even although there were 4 spare seats. This was very annoying as it meant you needed to book the shuttle bus in advance the day before, but as you know on holiday you don't always know your plans that far ahead. It was necessary to go outwith the hotel for dinner and nothing was in walking distance so the options were a taxi (expensive), local buses (infrequent) or the hotel shuttle bus. On the last night of our stay we ate in the hotel restaurant as we couldn't be bothered with the hassle of going elsewhere. The menu was pricey but we went anyway and the food was lovely, couldn't fault it. Our bill came and we added it to the room with a tip to make the bill up to a round number and also left a tip on the table. When we got back to the room we checked the online account balance that you could access through the tv and the restaurant bill was $10 more than what the bill had said. My husband phoned the front desk to query and we were told that the tip WE had written on the bill was $10 more than what we had actually written in. My husband said that we had not written that amount on the bill and there was no response, This really angered us as the tip we made up on the card was to simply make the total up to a round number and we left another tip on the table. It is lucky that we could afford the extra $10 and i realise it is not alot of money, however the cheek of them adding on the extra $10 is shocking. People tip what they can afford and what they feel is adequate.

The hotel is beautiful. Many things were of the standard of a five star hotel. The beds were so comfortable and the decor classy. Loved the pool area. The pool is not huge but big enough.

The area of LA is good but the location of the hotel isn't great if you don't have a car. There is nowhere to eat, drink or shop within walking distance. However, they hotel compensates for this by offering free shuttles. Basically like a free taxi service. Just book at the desk. The drivers were great. Friendly and can recommend places to go. I didn't have my laptop and it was a bit of a hassle to have to pay to use the computers considering other hotels we stayed at let you use them for free. You do get 15 minutes free per day but we needed to use the internet quite a bit due to our flight situation. There is a restaurant that we didn't try (it looked good though but not the stuff my nephews would eat) and there is a cafe in the lobby.

For a New Yorker who doesn't drive, the hotel's location near several bus lines was helpful, but the taxi from the airport was over $50. It is very convenient to the Getty and UCLA, however. Here are my grievances: 1. The advertised free shuttle must be booked way in advance. I was told at 9am that it would not be available until 1pm. I ended up taking the bus most days. 2. The hotel seems to rent out its pool during the days for baby swim lessons. This is bizarre and kind of ruins the experience of lounging by the pool. 3. There were no room service menus in the room when I arrived. When I called, they told me to come up to the restaurant to get a menu, since the restaurant menu is the room service menu. Room service is only available at meal times - NOT 24 hours. The fairly isolated location of the hotel means you will probably end up relying too much on the overpriced, boring restaurant. (Again, it would be very cool in the 90s.) 4. The coffee shop (the only place to buy basic snacks, water, etc.) was inexplicably closed for long periods of time, when its posted hours of operation were 6:30am - 8pm. 5.

We arrived in LA in the morning, at around 10am, from our flight from Philadelphia in the wee hours of the morning. Because we arrived so early, I attempted to get us checked in on the early side, and the two girls at the front desk were able to get us in a little on the early side, which was nice. Over the course of our stay, the hotel seemed quite busy, with groups of individuals being toured around, and with families milling around the lobby. The lobby is quite beautifully laid out with sofas and the pool area which is quite pretty and secluded. The gym is a nice bonus to have. There is one treadmill and one or two other pieces of equipment. The treadmill has a view of the pool which was pretty cool to look out upon while I did my morning run. We had come from over a foot of snow back home in Philadelphia, and the sun we got in LA was welcome. The location is okay. It's near to UCLA, so we could hit the Whole Foods there for snacks. Word to the wise, if you value your sleep, upgrade to a room on a higher executive floor. The first night of our stay, we were awakened at 3am by partiers. My husband called down to the front desk, and let them know that some partiers were being loud. We assumed that the loud music and chatter was coming from a nearby balcony. However, after little while, we realized that the party was happening at the pool, which was 7 floors below our room. Apparently, other rooms were calling and complaining about it as well, but it was only one hour later that the party was successfully broken up. I was not able to get back to sleep that night and I was pretty mad. The front desk definitely took our complaints seriously and over the next day, we were moved to a higher, quieter room. Apparently, the party had broken out while security was unavailable and it took a while for security to return to the hotel to break it up. After my husband complained further, the next day, the manager comped the first night in the room, The room itself was gorgeous, and the staff was very attentive, but I have reservations about staying here again. If I can be assured that the hotel will be quiet at night, I'm happy. White noise is hardly a problem on the highway side of the building.

The bed is fantastic as is the shower, despite the noise from the road it doesn't disturb that much and I'm a light sleeper. The hotel leaves ear plugs next to the bed but after the 1st evening room service threw them away which seemed a strange thing to do and didn't replace them for 2 nights. A couple of tips - if you like a cocktail or glass of wine in the evening they have 50% off mon - Fri in their bar 5pm-7pm and a great place to watch the sun go down over LA, a few nights a week there is free wine in the lobby for all the guests which is a nice touch.

However, when we arrived we were told the shuttle was broken and undergoing maintenance. Ok fine...so my husband had to take a 15 dollar cab ride to and from his interview. Thirty dollars we could have saved. Then, we get to our room and the balcony (which they also proudly advertise) is a total joke. It is so small and there is no furniture. You can only stand on it. Also, the towels in the bathroom look like they came from the dollar store. They were badly worn and frayed at the bottom. The following day, I go out to the pool...which was also broken. By this time, I was really mad. So the hotel offered to allow me to go over to Luxe Hotel across the street to use their pool. So inconveniently, I had to cross a very busy intersection and walk over to the other hotel to use their amenities. However, I was glad I did. The pool area at Luxe Hotel was beautiful. It is set up on a hill so it was very quiet. The cabanas and poolside loungers were very comfortable. The pool was also nicely heated. The staff was very friendly to me even though I wasn't a hotel guest. Later that day I decide to go upstairs to West, the hotel's restaurant. Yes, there are good views, but the drinks were disgusting and very strong. I ordered some calamari, which was average at best. The lounge area was also dirty. The couches stunk of stale beer and there was gum stuck to the tables. Ok it gets better...the following night we come home and the lobby was packed because 1 of 2 elevators was broken. We had to wait at least 15 minutes to get up to our room. The staff at the time, said the elevator was being fixed. However, the following afternoon, it was still broken. Prior to leaving for the airport we wanted to get cash for the cab ride. However, the ATM was broken. By this point I just laughed. This hotel is a total joke.

In fact, the hotel is less than 5 minutes from the entrance to the Getty museum (Los Angeles - not Malibu Villa). The entire staff was courteous and professional.

When the sliding glass door on the balcony was closed, the rushing cars provided what I would describe as \u201cwhite noise\u201d.

Firstly, the positives: The room rate that we managed to get was brilliant for the area. All other options were in excess of $180 p/night, whilst our room at the Angeleno was $104 p/night (Not including $18 p/night Valet Parking) - we got the room through cheaprooms.com for anyone looking to stay here. The hotel itself is clean, decorated well, and has friendly staff both at the reception and valet. However, that's where the problem starts... there's no real \"wow\" to this hotel (I guess you have to pay for it, but still...) everything is just... \"nice\" or \"adequate\". The rooms are pretty small so I would not recommend this for groups or families - the room is just barely big enough to accomodate my wife and I (and 2 bags!). We managed to get an \"Executive\" room in our rate, but that basically means you're on a higher floor with a better view and mounted LCD TV. Beware the 360 views of the rooms on the website - they make the rooms look a lot bigger than they actually are! There is one major problem with the Executive rooms... for some bizzare reason, the hotel have placed the conference rooms on the top level of the hotel, so if you're staying on floor 15 (like we are) expect to hear a LOT of noise (chairs/tables being dragged across the floor) throughout the day and early morning from the floor above. We did complain about this, but all the staff can do is move you to a lower floor, which means you lose the view... so the \"Executive\" room is a double edged sword. Due to the location of the hotel you tend to be driving out a lot to find places to eat - there's nothing in the immediate surrounding area and there's only one resteraunt in the hotel which is very pricey. Special note must go to the breakfast at the hotel... it's VERY expensive, but VERY good! FInally, Valet Parking... it's $18 a night for guests staying at the hotel and also for outside visitors just visiting the hotel. I would really expect guests staying at the hotel to get a better rate, but not so here. In conclusion, it's a \"nice\" rate for a \"nice\" hotel. Anyone visiting for leisure may want to look at other (slightly more expensive) options which have slightly larger rooms and more immediate amenities in the vicinity.

I *finally* don't have to think about where I want to stay anymore! Right off the bat, their location is spectacular. You can throw a rock and hit the 405 (but don't actually do that...). Within 10 minutes you can be on Ventura Blvd in Studio City, or 3rd Street in Santa Monica, or at the Grove in Beverly Hills. Want to go down to Disneyland for the day? It's only 35 minutes if you leave at the right time... The hotel rooms are delightfully pleasant. The round architecture provides interesting room design, and Angeleno devoted a lot of great effort to optimizing the room configuration. After living there for a week I've decided the result is perfect use of space. I admin I was worried about traffic noise, but the balcony doors effectively drown it out. And if you travel with a white noise machine as I do, you will hear literally nothing, even if you sleep through the morning. (If you don't travel with white noise, I've no idae what your expectations of a hotel may be...) I have to write a paragraph on its own about the bed. I come from an elitist Tempurpedic mattress at home, and Angeleno's bed was very plainly a lot more comfortable. I forgot to look at the tag to find out who made it, but the fact that it occurred to me to have done so should speak volumes. I never sleep well in hotels. But Angeleno's bed had me the first night. Not too hot, not too cold, not too hard, but just right. I think I slept 11 hours. The hotel staff are, frankly, perfect. They fade into the background, which is exactly what I want. Perfectly courteous when I checked in, and cognizant enough to welcome me back with simple greetings as I came back each day. I have to give exta special credit to the hotel's Valet and Housekeeping teams. They were spectacular! Literally every day (all hours) I called down for my car from my room, and it drove up as I walked from the elevator to the front door. I mean these guys are either magic or very on top of things (or both). And Housekeeping made sure to visit no matter how late I slept. The room was immaculate every time I entered it.

The not as good but not worth complaining about: * 3 very shallow dresser drawers and very limited closet hanging space in our room - no place to stash our suitcase out of the way * very thin/poor quality bed sheet which literally ripped in my hands when I rolled over during the night * hotel bar was pretty loud and rowdy - but it was a weekend night so I guess that's to be expected * there are no restaurants near the hotel so we ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant our first morning there - but never again - it was too expensive (appx $25/head) and they weren't even apologetic when their weirdo contemporary-design teapot didn't pour properly spilled hot tea all over. * 18/night mandatory valet - I knew to expect the mandatory valet and I even knew the price, but it still seems a little steep.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGood location despite initial misgivings.\u201d", "Author": "lasvegas-marmalade", "ReviewID": "UR16947414", "Content": "We arrived in Los Angeles by train from San Francisco and took a taxi to the hotel.

I don't care if my mother were behind the desk, I would've wanted her to ask for ID.

The hotel is in a perfect location, between Bel Air and Santa Monica, just near the houses of Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, Tom Criuse, etc. It's on the highway exit and this means you can hear the noise of the traffic, in this case I suggest to have an higher floor room looking to the sea. The hotel is simply trendy! The swimming pool has a big fireplace and very confortable lounge chairs. In the roof there's a very nice bar and restaurant. One week before I'd been to the Biltmore in LA downtown that's very different. I liked both the hotels, in this case the location in much better and you feel the real atmosphere of the high class quartier of LA.

Pool area is very nice - although does not get vey much sun in the afternoon. Problems were the freeway noise - unreal - doesn't matter which side of the hotel your room is on, had to use the A/C to drown it out. The cleaning staff was not very attentive, bathrom not cleaned well daily, had to call down for replacement supplies. Bathrobes were missing. Housekeeping walked into the room unannounced one afternoon which was a bit startling. Number of towels each day was inconsistent - had to dry with a facecloth at one point! Just little details that should really be attended to. Also - disliked the valet parking, (which is mandatory) while the valet staff was generally pleasant, it was very inconvenient to call down every time we needed to leave - phone rang busy, often times had to wait for some time for our vehicle. Overall - it was an okay experience and I would recommend this as a good place to stay for a night or 2, but we were there a week - and feel that perhaps another hotel would provide a much more comfortable stay, and will be looking to book elsewhere for our week in October.", "Date": "September 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "guayaquil", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "tlucin", "ReviewID": "UR10010546", "Content": "In my first trip to los Angeles, i stay in Angelino\u00b4s hotel, i resume my experience in one word Excellent, the room, was just like yo see at the web site, very clean, confortable, the bed was great, the hotel have a little market that is small but have the necessary to grab something to eat, the restaurant was very good too, when i arrive, i surprise becasuse the location is almost between highways, but the kind man who take my suitcase to my room give a tour for the hotel and inform me that they have a complimentary shuttle wherevere i want to 3miles around, and they also can recomend me where to shop and eat at this shuttle, i just have to ak 30 minutes before, and them they sent for me too.

I absolutely love the warm and inviting atmosphere. As a former hotel administrator I tend to pay close attention to detail, especially in how the staff treat their guests. I can honestly say that in all the years of hotel employment or personal hotel visits, I have never encountered a more outgoing group of employees. I literally felt like I was in \"their\" home. What was even better was the genuine sincerity each staff member displayed. The pool area was occupied with an Emmy function; however as the Banquet staff were breaking down the tables, they invited me in. I didn't want to be in the way but they were so accommodating that they were nice enough to set up a lounge area for me, right in the midst of their busy schedule. I was impressed not only by the atmosphere downstairs, but also with the restaurant/club West on the upper level. What a \"posh\" place this is! The staff really seem to enjoy themselves.

My room faced the 405 and I was a bit concerned about the freeway noise, but as soon as the I shut the sliding glass door, I couldn't hear a thing. Their local shuttle is handy and the hotel is also on the #2 bus line, so the Westwood theatres and the Sunset Strip are just a short ride away. The maid service was outstanding and I loved the bed turn-down service at night. I do have to chuckle, while checking in, there was an elderly man who had a bit of a problem with his room. It seems he just wasn't comfortable with the \"openness\" of the shower stall (glassed in, no shower curtain) and the opaque glass door of the bathroom. The manager was trying to explain that the hotel has a modern/chic look and feel, but I guess that might be too much for someone who is a bit more consertavie.

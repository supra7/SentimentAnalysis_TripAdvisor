The Back Bay area was experiencing power failure due to transformer fires earlier in the week. This had an adverse effect on our experience in many ways. I knew beforehand about the issue and chose to keep my reservation at Westin Copley. Having called the hotel on Thursday AM I received assurance that the power had been restored and was no longer an issue. The hotel and conference hall lost power several times over the course of our 5 day stay. Though the hotel staff handled the matter as well as could be expected but I was surprised that a hotel like the Westin would not have measures in place to mitigate the issue. Most of it boiled down to minor inconveniences (Conference Hall going dark, I couldn\u2019t print boarding passes in the business center on Sunday night, etc) but I don\u2019t expect to have to deal with that at a Westin. To make matters worse my son was disappointed to find the pool closed for rennovation. I take no pleasure in writing a negative review of Westin Copley. (We stayed tyhere in 2011 and had a great time.) Generally I love Westin hotels and don\u2019t mind paying a little more to stay there. That also means I have higher expectations when I do stay at a Westin. This time unfortunately, Westin Copley did not meet that expectation.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice place!\u201d", "Author": "podunkjeep", "ReviewID": "UR126444552", "Content": "A small but comfy room.

We walked everywhere except to the MFA (took a $13 cab). The hotel is attached to the Copley Place mall (which is attached to the Prudential shops), which has upscale shopping (Neiman Marcus, Louis Vuitton, Barney's) and eats. Prior to checking into the hotel, we spent the day at the Boston Museum of Science with the kids. After an easy check in, we grabbed pizza on Newbury St. at the Upper Crust and headed back the hotel for night swim. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the hotel room was during the night. A clean room with plenty of towels and we were given our requested room- two queen size beds. In room coffee with Starbucks was a good start to the morning. I did read the reviews about the snacks and minibar - the warnings are true, so don't touch them unless you plan on purchasing them.

When we pulled up in our car, the doorman suggested that, due to construction in their parking lot, we self-park in the Prudential center. This was a bit of a daunting task, at first, because I was not sure where to go and how to get back to the hotel from the Prudential Center, a block away, but attached through a shopping mall. Better signage in the shopping mall, directing weary travelers back to the hotel would have been a big plus. But, overnight parking in the Prudential Center is $29, as opposed to $46 in the hotel, not a bad bargain if you have only light luggage to deal with. Our room was spacious and lovely, with a beautiful view of the city. It was comfortable and extremely pleasant. There are plenty of electrical outlets (always appreciated.) The only annoyance was a \"snack center\" on the dresser, complete with $8 canned Pringles and a printed warning that if you accidentally move the merchandise, it will be recorded by a sensor and you will be billed for the price of the item, whether or not you consume it. Really, have we not moved past this tacky stage of hotel management? The location is excellent. There is a T stop a block away, for transport to other areas of the city, and there are wonderful restaurants within walking distance.

Having no idea which taxi company it was, without a receipt, and late at night I asked the valet if he had any idea of the name of the taxi company. Rather then shrugging, he said let me go check the cameras and see if we can find the taxi number. After a hour, Sarim Son's security team and the valet person, tracked down the taxi numbber and phone number of the taxi company. Miraculously, we were able to reach the taxi driver who found the wallet and returned it to the hotel. These extraordinary effort and resourcefulness made the next two days and 4 flights far easier -- with ID and credit cards -- and made me tremendously appreciative for the willingness, kindness, and intelligence of the Westin staff to go out of their way to help distracted guest.

The parks in Boston are beautiful, and filled with interesting, friendly people. The hotel is close to many restaurants, parks, tour pick-up and drop-off, the farmers market, etc. If the weather is bad, every imaginable business is in the attached conference center, from Starbucks to Japanese food, to clothing and jewelry stores. The hotel is not near the water, which I was okay with. I fell head over heels in love with the city on this trip. Everything was close to the hotel (within half a mile) that I could possibly think of doing, with the exception of the JFK Library, which was worth taking the train and a bus to get to. While in Boston, I highly recommend seeing the nation's first municipal public library (more like a museum) that is just right across the street -- a breathtaking building!

We come to enjoy being in the city and favour this location for immediate access to shops, restaurants and public transport. My previous contributions reveal an eclectic mix of places to stay, from the cheap and efficient Hampton Inns which suit our road trip accommodation perfectly, to the ultra-luxe Park Hyatt Tokyo and similar when we feel like a splurge. Our choice for a city break is always a high end hotel with reliably comfortable accommodations to return to pre-dinner and later, for a good night's sleep. Of course, these places don't come cheap and the Westin certainly charges highly for these facilities. Except they no longer deliver the full service. During our four night's stay, we had a succession of irritations, starting with a couple of minor omissions: no shower gel or shower cap in the bathroom, for example. Allowing this to pass as a one-off error, we hoped that the next room service would sort it out. But no - the next service didn't only \"forget\" the shower stuff, but failed to replenish the coffee supplies too. (the notice states that further supplies may be purchased, incidentally). My comment at reception about these issues, including a lack of turn down service resulted in the response that guests need to make specific requests for such amenities as shower gel now. Westin, if that's really so, then a notice stating that would be helpful. The lack of consistent and reliable service became annoying and any warmth or loyalty we felt towards the hotel soon disappeared in a mix of unresolved grumbles. In spite of reporting early in our stay that the reading light above the bed was broken, nothing was done and the final straw was delivered when we asked for a late checkout, only to be told that the hotel was sold out, so the answer had to be no. Unless we wanted to pay $25 for an extra hour, that is. Actually, there was another final straw - 4 days valet parking charge added to our bill in error \"because there was another guest with the same name\", and as I sit at the airport writing this review, we have just received an email with another $30 charge for the 'honor bar' which we never touched. The final straws just keep on coming. So, we leave the Westin Copley Place not only as disgruntled guests, but with unresolved issues as well. Above all, no one seemed to care about our experience. No one accepted responsibility or offered much of an apology and the reception staff were universally lacking in warmth and interpersonal skills.

I have never seen a cockroach in my house and you see those \"not so often\" in Boston! They moved me to a better room, however it was late be then and I had a flight to catch at 5:30 AM. And then, they charged me for the internet service! I called them up and they refunded my room, after I was back home. That was my last night in Boston, and I have to say I do not have very happy memories of the Westin! I would never ever go back there again. Fairmont Copley Plaza, just around the corner, similarly priced, is a much better hotel, I stayed there for 5 nights, although rooms are small, but the service is great.

Big grocery supermarket and Tour buses stops just across the street if you choose to take a tour. Shopping, of course, Westin is connected to the Mall and you can get to the many department stores, or just get to the Boylston and Newbury streets where are may shops and restaurant via Sky Walks passages (great for rainy or cold weather). There are several restaurants/bars that you can get to without going outside. Hotel rooms are quite large - my king size room was very spacious, nice hardwood floor at the entrance door foyer. Bathroom was somewhat small - agree with other reviewers. Personally to me, not a big deal, I saw smaller bathrooms in Europe, and I don't spend much time there anyway, so as long as it is clean, works for me. Bathroom was very clean. Room was clean too, carpet with no spots, no smell in the room, amazing view of a city and Charles river. Hotel staff was wonderful, very friendly and responsive to any needs, questions or concerns. There is no kitchenette in room but there is a coffee maker. There is no refrigerator in the room (there is a mini-bar), but you can always ask for one and they will bring it in promptly.

The room closet was absolutely huge and the desk and entertainment center had lots of plugs for all our electronic devices. The TV even came with game controllers for the kids. Some may gripe about small bathrooms which I agree & wifi charges in the room. I would imagine business traveler they are use to a wifi fee & the rest of us can take a quick trip down to the lobby for a little free wifi. Valet parking is expensive but we were using our car multiple times throughout our stay and were willing to pay the $46/day fee for the convenience of coming and going.

Although somewhat pricey, I think given the location and the level or service onsite it was an excellent value. My one complaint came after checkout. We got home to an updated bill from the hotel including $30.56 for in-room mini bar charges. I can't for the life of me figure out how that happened - we never touched any of the minibar. When I called to deal with the bill, the billing department refused to correct the bill, saying that we had activated the weight-sensitive triggers that charges to the room for each item. I think a simple spot check would have confirmed that these items were not removed or used, but they insisted that they were. I found it contrary to the attitudes of the staff onsite, who were ameniable and helpful at all times. In short, I won't return to this hotel out of principle. There's a reason why I stick with the Hilton family - I've never had ANY issues like this. I would probably still recommend the hotel as a whole, but encourage you to confirm your bill before checking out - once you're gone, they have your money and will likely not refund any incorrect charges.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cProblem with service\u201d", "Author": "Ilayuk", "ReviewID": "UR119782181", "Content": "Although our room was spectacular I have to report that a pair of earrings disappeared from my room while I was having breakfast.

The hotel itself is attached to the sprawling Copley Center, which is a large, upscale mall. The hotel's parking was completely full due to multiple weddings, so we had to park at the mall and walk back to the hotel (via indoor passages and skywalks). This was a trifle annoying but the staff was apologetic -- they really couldn't do more than they did. The hotel itself is stylish even if the overall decor tends toward the dark end of the color palette. Once past check-in we found our room to be very spacious. The furnishings were all very high quality (as I would expect for this class of hotel), the bathroom was very nice, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were there for a couple's getaway, but they had a large glass-topped desk with plenty of accessory plugs for ample working space, and they even have an additional charging station in one of the nightstands for convenience. The view from our side of the hotel was of South Boston -- it was a very nice view, especially at night. My only caution (not really a complaint) is with the honor bar. I happened to read the sign and noticed that they use a pressure sensor. If you even move something, either dry goods or in the fridge, you will be charged. So we had honor bar rum because my wife touched it. We had a night on the town and returned to the hotel a few minutes after 1 am to find the lounge was already closed. This was a little surprising, but quite a few places in Boston do close around 1 am -- if you are interested in nightlife. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

Valet service was prompt, our bags were taken out and loaded immediately. The front desk agent who checked us in (Michelle) was friendly and did not hesistate when we asked questions about amenities within the hotel. Upon getting into the room, my boyfriend and I promptly inspected the room (we both worked in housekeeping mgt) We found very little wrong with the room. The linens on the bed were fresh, no stains or smells. The bathroom was dust free and the shower was up to standard. Past reviews mentioned a small bathroom, they weren't joking. It is a tight bathroom but it does what it's suppose to do. The amenities smelled nice, did not prefer to use them though because I was unsure of the quality. Our bags arrived right after we came in the room, the bellman told us all about the area and what streets we could find something to eat. The only unfortunate part of the stay is that we requested a refrigerator (which came on time) but smelled like vomit! I had to use burning hot water, soap, and a washcloth to clean out and it still smelled vaguely of it once I was done. It was usable but still gross!! PROS: Spacious room (King room) Bed was VERY comfortable and clean to sleep in, we basically passed out each night. The location of the hotel is SO close to subway (the T) and is close to high-end shopping and local eateries. All staff were absolutely friendly and very helpful. CONS: Elevators take forever! They have a large elevator bank but it still takes awhile for you to get one. The elevator indicator lights up but doesn't open the doors until another 30-60 seconds. Weird. The TV takes about 6-8 seconds to load each channel. Valet is $46/night!! Only other option is parking across the street in parking garage that will charge you each time you exit/re-enter.

My family was in Boston for a convention and staying at the Sheraton Copley, which like our hotel, was connected to the mall (but on the otherside). Check-in was very easy. There were no lines and they let us check in a little early. We decided to park at a garage located at 100 clarendon since we found a coupon online that saved us a lot. The garage ended up being only a block away and saved us big time since our car battery died the day we were leaving and they were quick to help us out. Our room was very nice and the bed was so comfortable that we are actually considering shelling out the $300+ to buy the comforter for our bed at home. The only complaint I have about the rooms are that they are very dark. Also, be careful not to touch any of the food or drink items in the room since they have electronic sensors that will charge you if you take something out just to look at it (which later became the butt of many jokes). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pool (it looked very small) or the gym (which had some high tech. equipment). The lobby always smelled fishy. This might be because there is a sushi restaurant and fishery right when you walk in. Not a great smell, even if you are a fish lover like me. I do have to say we were really happy with the location of this hotel. It was right near Newbury Street, and within walking distance to the Freedom Trail. If you are staying here for a conference at the convention center, be prepared to do a lot of walking. I would estimate about 20 minutes each way. It is nice that you can walk to the convention center without going outside just by going through the mall. Seeing the Sheraton, I would have to say, I thought it was a nicer and more convenient location. However, if you get a good deal on the Westin, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth staying here.

I instead went to the concierge for help just to get some help with my key. She told me that she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything and I need to join the queue. I told her that was ridiculous.

The hotel staff did a great job of putting on a large event, and the meeting rooms were modern and comfortable.

The hotel connects to the Copley Place shopping mall, which as far as I can tell is just like every other high-end shopping mall in America. Certainly not a draw for me.

The Westin Copley was attractive because it is attached to a shopping mall and is located in the main shopping area with tube/train stations nearby. The first weekend was fine, no issues. The room is a good size and clean. The bathroon is TINY but that was not an issue. The second weekend I was joined by my sister. I called up beforehand to specifically request a twin room. I would have switched hotels if a twin room was unavailable. I was told that a twin room was available and my booking was changed to reflect that. My sister arrived first and she was told that there were no twin rooms but that they would give us a rollaway for no extra cost. When I arrived late that night and went to speak to the front desk, apparently speaking to the manager. She was apologetic but could not understand why I was making a fuss. I tried to explain to her that I had taken the effort to call them to ensure that a twin room was available and that I wouldn't have stayed at that hotel if one of us had to sleep on a rollaway. There are plenty of other hotels in Boston and the Westin is not particularly cheap ($300 plus tax per night). She just kept saying, in effect, that there was nothing she could do. Her tone and attitude really annoyed me. There was no offer to help in any other way or to offer some sort of goodwill gesture. In the end I had to suggest that they moved us a twin room the following day. What particularly annoyed me was that she tried to place some blame on my sister for the current situation which was totally unprofessional. She was more worried about covering her own backside than making sure the customer was happy. The following day, I had decided that we would just stay put in the room as I had been travelling for a while and really couldn't bear to repack and move to another room so we went to the front desk to inform them. That night, we got back to the hotel with a message that they had tried to move us but couldn't as our stuff hadn't been packed up. Just total incompetence.

The prices were all inflated and the hotels I really wanted to stay at were already booked. I am allergic to feather down, so earlier in the week before my stay I contacted the folks at Starwood via their web chat application since their email application on their website was not working. They assured me I would have a room prepared with hypoallergenic bedding. I checked in early 5/28/11 around 8AM. I did not expect a room to be ready and really just wanted to leave our bags. When I asked to confirm my request for a hypoallergenic room, the gentleman assisting me stated (in a rude tone of voice) \"When you book on Priceline we can't see those requests, you have to contact us directly.\" When I stated that I had in fact contacted them directly he just shrugged and stated that there was going to be a wait of about an hour and requested that I leave my cell phone number and they would call when it was ready. Around noon, I decided to call them since at that point it had been more than an hour. I explained the situation to the front desk attendant that answered my call, and she said that there was a room available with a king bed on the 25th floor. I asked if it had been prepared with hypoallergenic linens and she acted confused (as clearly it wasn't in the system, still)... Upon my check in I was given a room on the 34th floor with a fantastic view and it had been prepared appropriately. The view was amazing and the room was spacious. The transitional foyer with hardwood floors looked as if they had never been cleaned, and sadly so did the shower. There was thick soap scum on the shower wall, and the bathroom was quite dimly lit. I also narrowly escaped gashing my foot open on a piece of glass that was on the floor. The climate control worked perfectly and no complaints with the plumbing. The television was a decent size flat screen and we had no problems with that as well. The location was fairly good, being close to Newbury St., and Copley Sq T stop was right there. Lots of dining options in the neighborhood and on premises. We used the pool and whirlpool facilities, but they were on the small side, not very well kept, and full of children at all hours. Even though the whirlpool is restricted to people over the age of 16, it was constantly full of younger children. I guess you can only blame the parents for that... On our last morning before check out, around 11am the housekeeper burst into our room exclaiming \"You're still here?\" after I had said \"Hello?\" when I heard someone trying to open the door.

There were scuffs along the floorboards in the room, the hallway carpeting had stains, and the shower was old. This past weekend I was happy to discover renovated guest rooms and guest floor hallways to match the already very nice lobby and other public areas. Guest rooms couldn't be better. Now the signature Westin Heavenly Bed is complimented by features such as a high back chair with ottoman that makes for at-home comfort when reading or watching TV at the end of the day, new carpeting and wall coverings, HDTV, and very important for those of us who travel with a lot of gadgets that need to be re-charged---tons of electrical outlets. Desk chairs are modern and comfortable when having to do some work, though arms on the chairs would have added comfort. Guest bathrooms are tiny but now fully re-done to be at their best. Everything is handy. Shampoo and conditioner are already place in the shower so that a guest doesn't have to remember to look for them prior to getting in the shower. The hair dryer isn't hidden someplace difficult to find in some bag but rather placed helpfully at the corner of the vanity for an easy grab after showering. Beds have reading lights. These are all the helpful little touches in a guest room that add up to a wonderful stay. The safe in my room was locked when I arrived but within 15 minutes of calling downstairs about it, hotel security came and got it unlocked for me to be able to use prior to going out for the evening. That kind of responsiveness is appreciated. The lobby already was, and still is a very warm and comfortable central area. There are lots of plush chairs and sofas with a fireplace to add to the relaxed mood. A Starbucks just outside the lobby provides a place to grab a drink and relax in the lobby. There is also a good indoor pool and whirlpool. The location is outstanding for just about any purpose in Boston. It is one short block to the T's Green Line which allows for airport transportation for $1.70 each way (via transfers to the Red Line at Park Street and Silver Line at South Station--about a 45 minute trip but much more affordable than the $55 cab fare each way!) using a reloadable Charlie Card that can be obtained from any T station and for quick transport at that same $1.70 rate to any place in the city. The hotel is connected to Copley Place and Prudential Center with their many shops and places to eat. The hotel itself has Turner Fisheries, one of the best seafood restaurants in Boston. Symphony Hall, home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops is either a 15 minute walk or two subway stop trip. The Museum of Fine Arts is just five T stops away. It is two blocks to Newbury Street with its shops, galleries, restaurants, and bars. Boston Common is just one T stop or a 10 minute walk away. Same for Beacon Hill. The brownstones of Commenwealth Avenue facing a park its length are just three blocks away. Fenway is just a few T stops or a 20 minute walk away. The Esplanade along the Charles River with its walkways and park benches is just a ten minute stoll up the street. The Westin is close to it all. While room rates aren't bargain basement, they are reasonable for the high standard of comfort and location in such a hotel and a good value when compared to a hotel like the Fairmont across the street. The Fairmont is nice with its chandeliers and other attributes but the staff can be rather stiff and the hotel costs twice as much per night as the Westin without offering twice the level of luxury, especially now that the Westin's guest rooms have been renovated.

You are however able to take your car in and out as you wish for no additional charge. The attendants were very nice and extremely professional. The wait time to retrieve the car was very short. Check in and out was very smooth. The front desk operators were also very nice and eager to make our stay a good one. We had a small charge added to our bill because we took something out of the mini bar (all items are on an electric sensor so they know when you take something out) that we only looked at but didn't eat. We mentioned this at check out and the charge was removed, no questions asked. The room was great. It was very spacious and clean. The bed... AMAZING!!! It was a very quiet room and we could hear no hallway foot traffic or noise from other guest rooms. You can here a slight outside traffic noise, but nothing over whelming or disturbing. The bathroom would be our only complaint of the room. Although very clean, it was extremely small, the wallpaper was coming loose at the seams, the grout in the tub was very roughly patched in areas, and the tub (although not gross), had a slight dirty look to it. The restaurant bar was good and bad. When we went for drinks and appetizers early (about 3 pm), service was great, the food good, and the drinks strong. The prices were a little elevated, but nothing outrageous. When we went back later (about 11 pm) it was jammed packed with people and we waited about 25 minutes for service before we finally left to go somewhere else. The location of the hotel is great. It is connected to a high end mall that you can walk through to get from place to place. Our friends were staying at the Sheraton, 3 hotels away, and we simply walked through the mall to get to them. (By the way, the consierge was very helpful in pointing out the way.) Although the stores are closed, the walking area is open late (possibly 24 hours). We walked through at 1 AM and ran into no problems. Speaking of location, the reason we were in town was for the Red Sox / Yankees game. The Westin is only a mile or 2 from Fenway. Although I'm sure you could walk on a nice day, it was raining and it was a very quick ($7) cab ride to the park.

First off, the good things. The location of the hotel was excellent, near many restaurants, shops, and very close to two T stations. You can get to the Freedom Trail, West End, or Fenway in just a couple of stops. Also, the views are excellent. We had a room facing the Charles River and we were able to view the 4th of July fireworks from the comfort of our room. Unfortunately, the bad outweighed the good by a large margin. We arrived at the hotel a little early before check-in time. They told us they would hold the luggage and call us once our room was ready, probably around 2pm. We were ok with that since we wanted to go ahead and start exploring the city. Well, we returned to the hotel at 4pm, not having gotten any phone call about our room. It was still not ready then. They said that housekeeping had fallen behind. At this point we were very tired, having been up since 4am to catch a flight. They did end up finding us a room after more time standing around and waiting. Not exactly Westin type service. When we got to the room, the first thing I noticed is the state of the carpet. It was dirty and old and needed replacement. There were stains in several places. I was not even comfortable walking around in bare feet. The room needed some serious renovation, starting with the carpet. My wife noticed that there were several stains on the comforter as well. When she looked more closely, she was horrified when she saw there were tiny hairs on the sheet left from the previous guest. We both looked at it and agreed that the hairs were most likely from the pubic area. We were disgusted. We complained to housekeeping and the manager on duty. Even the housekeeper assigned to our floor admitted that she did not change the sheets or comforter between guests Ewwwww!!! We had them change out everything after that. When talking to the manager, he didn't seem all that compassionate (he even left in the middle of our conversation to take something to another guest). He did end up offering us breakfast for 2 nights. I would've preferred a percentage off the rate or SPG points. There was no excuse for that kind of housekeeping negligence at a hotel the caliber of a Westin. Days Inn, maybe. But not Westin. The AC in the room did not work well either. We had set it to the lowest setting (60F) and it was still hot at night. We had requested that maintenance look at it while we were gone during the day, but obviously it wasn't done or they didn't find anything wrong. Request to housekeeping for extra towels or shampoo took a long time, sometimes more than an hour. The concierge staff was literally useless. They were not very friendly and didn't really go out of their way to give good directions, or recommendations on what to see or where to dine. They gave very short and blunt answers. No warm fuzzies here. It was sad that the Enterprise car agent seated at the kiosk right next to the concierge desk, gave us much better information on the city and sites. It wasn't even her job. All in all, while I was happy with the hotel's location and easy access to things, I was disappointed with the overall stay. I've stayed at many Westins and this one was not up to par with most of them. My wife talked me out of staying at the Renaissance which cost about half of what the Westin was charging and probably would've been a much better experience. Even the brand new W in town had a cheaper rate than the Westin Copley.

I'd been there before socially but never stayed in one of the rooms. I regret it. Having stayed in probably a couple dozen different Westins, this is without question the worst experience I've had overall - as Westins go. Certainly did not live up to the name or the price. Wish I'd stayed at Nine Zero or the Mandarin instead. THE GOOD: - BED: - Typical truly Heavenly bed. Triple sheeting, top quality bedding, etc. - SERVICE: - valet, front desk and concierge, \"Service Express\", room requests (eg, housekeeping items) - is speedy and friendly, with one exception noted below. Was given an unrequested staggering view over the river - ETHICS: - $5 credit per night (usable at the hotel's food properties) for not requiring bed turnover. Nice to see a hotel put its money where its green mouth is - GYM: - large and well-equipped, with private TVs at the cardio equipment - PETS: - they allow dogs without charging a fee. Very civilized - DECOR: - lobby and hallways - are spotless and moderately upscale, if dated - LOCATION: - terrific, of course - attached to two good malls, and so close to Newbury and other Back Bay shopping/dining and the Common/Garden. I don't give this particular property a lot of credit, though, for the corporate office long aog having chosen a good existing property to take over. It's what you do with what you're given... THE DISAPPOINTING: - SERVICE: - My breakfast hangtag was placed on the door more than 5 hours before the cutoff time, but was never picked up. (To their credit, they did deliver the order 12 minutes after it was placed by phone.) Still, a business hotel can't make an amateur mistake like that - SERVICE: - The final bill was not delivered under-the-door the morning of checkout - CHECK-IN: - slow and understaffed (took almost 20 minutes to get to the desk, with only 3 people in front of me). It only got worse throughout my stay - VALET: - similarly, valet / dealing with the car was unusually ill-organized, hectic and understaffed - ROOM SIZE: - the smallest Westin room I recall ever staying in - BATHROOM: - very small, yes even for an urban hotel. 2 people could not be in there at the same time. Two showerheads though, a nice touch - AMENITIES: - Stingy - only shampoo, conditioner and lotion - though what was provided was high quality. We had to ask for robes and slippers, though again they were typical top quality - NO FREE WIFI: - it continues to amaze me that any hotel thinks it can get away without offering free wifi and not expect it to be remarked upon unfavorably. Consider this an unfavorable remark - ROOM SERVICE: - breakfast was serviceable - nothing special aside from the excessive quantity. Breathtakingly overpriced, even for a Westin, even for an urban setting. I've paid less for vastly superior breakfasts at, eg, various Four Seasons - POOL & POOL AREA: - ugly and dingy. Well, let's be honest - they're gross. Probably the most sub-Westin element I noticed THE BAD: - PARKING: - costs FORTY-FOUR DOLLARS A NIGHT. This isn't Tokyo. That's flat-out gouging of your guests who are paying *plenty* already - ONE RUDE STAFF MEMBER: - the only staff person we encountered who was anything less than delightful: a woman at the \"service express\" line (when you press zero) who was rude and a poor communicator. She did not listen to the questions I asked, answered questions I HADN'T asked, and ended her own sentences before they seemed complete, with sudden silence, in what felt like a bizarre, vaguely hostile way. She seemed harried and irritated, and was openly cross in her tone and speech, in each of the several conversations we had over the course of my stay. If anyone at the hotel cares, which seems unlikely, she would not provide her name but she had a Caribbean accent I could not place. - LEAK: - Some sort of leak in the sink/bathroom that kept the carpet outside the bathroom waterlogged throughout our stay. Clearly an ongoing but unfixed problem IN SUM: had this been a \"lesser\" chain than the Westin - or had it been half the price or less - I might have given it another star.

My wife and I live in NYC and at 1AM Saturday morning, she decided on a whim to take a road trip to Boston and spend the night. (We had never been to Boston.) We honestly picked this hotel because on Priceline, she bid on the price and got it for less than half of what the listed price was. When we got there, the hotel was immaculate and the room was nicely appointed and was big enough. The location could not be any more central in Boston. Their subway, the \"T\" was a block a way and the Boston public library was also a block away. Boylston Street is a block away and is lined with wonderful restaurants and cool stores. The hotel is located in the Prudential Center, which is essentially a huge high end mall. (Jimmy Choos, Pinks, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany's, stores like that) So if shopping is your thing, you can shop until your heart's content and just walk right back to the Hotel. I thought the staff was professional and polite as well and definitely were right on with their dinner recommendations. Two of the restaurants we went to based on their recommendations and are within walking distance were Skip Jacks and Atlantic Fish Company. Both served wonderful sea food and the prices were pretty much what I expected for being Boston and its location. Anyways, you can't go wrong with this hotel at all. Another huge plus was their bed. Probably one of the most comfortable beds I had ever slept in. (I like a firm bed and they tie Crowne Plaza for best beds in my opinion.) I found three negatives to this hotel in my opinion, which to me wasn't a big deal but I just want to be as informative as possible. The first is that you can hear through the walls. (I could hear people turn their water on, someone opening their drapes) Now I know it is beyond the hotel's staff control and it honestly didn't bother me. ( I could sleep through a nuclear war) But if you are a light sleeper, it might bother you. The second is the price to park at the hotel. It was $44 a night! We got around this though by googling garages around that particular hotel and we got a discounted spot in the prudential center for $25. We parked on the P1 level and the elevator took us right next to a California Pizza Kitchen. That was in front of an enclosed bridge that took us to the Westin. The third negative was the price for a breakfast. (In hotels like these, breakfast tend to be highway robbery) You can get around that by eating at Au Bon Pain, which is located directly next to the Westin.

I thought our room was unremarkable for a hotel this pricey, and with two beds it was a bit cramped, but it was comfortable and clean, with great Back Bay views. The beds were very comfortable. The pool was small, and since the hotel was huge, it was generally too crowded with kids for any real adult exercise opportunities (like swimming laps). The exercise room was nice--but again, unsupervised kids goofing around on the equipment made serious exercise a bit challenging. My trip was part business, part pleasure, but my meetings were elsewhere, so I can say nothing about the on-site business facilities. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, however. We took the train from the airport, since there is a stop right outside the Boston Public Library (which is right next to the hotel and worth a visit just to see the interior architecture, if nothing else). It took us a little under an hour to ride into town by train and wheel our luggage the block and a half to the hotel--we travel light.

The covered walk ways also lead you to the Prudential Tower so in the winter months when temperatures are below freezing this is a fantastic bonus. The palm restaurant is overpriced and you wont get value for money. For 2 steaks we ended up paying over $100, this was not served with fries, salad or any sort of sides which was a little disappointing.

I have stayed at other Westin hotels while on business and was able to get the Westin Copley Place for $117.00 per night on Priceline. Checking in was a breeze and as usual, the Westin staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. In fact, when the desk agent learned of our anniversary, we were upgraded to a suite and provided a complimentary breakfast for one of the mornings. Our room was clean and comfortable. Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Heavenly Bed lived up to its name and we both slept well. The Heavenly Shower was no more than a second shower head with decent water pressure. The toiletries (soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion) were also provided. If I had to point out anything negative it would be the cheap Hamilton Beach iron which only made it more difficult to press our cloths. The room also had a desk larger than most kitchen tables, internet access ($9.95 per day), in room safe, 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd LCD television with cable and HBO. If you are not used to staying in 4-star hotels you will soon learn the hotel restaurants cater to guests who prefer upscale dining. With the exception of the breakfast buffet in The Huntington ($24.00 per person) which was excellent, we did not use the hotel restaurants. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Parking at the hotel is $42.00 per night plus tip for the valet. I found a great web site boston.bestparking.com. Here, you can enter the address in Boston where you are staying. The site will display a virtual map with parking garages in the area and their rates. You can print a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rate guarantee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and save. I self-parked at the Prudential Center. Their normal rate is $39.00 per day but with the printed voucher, the rate was reduced to $25.00 per day. It was a very short walk to the hotel.

It's what you'd expect for a large, chain hotel: large reception areas, large halls, tall building, missing a feeling of intimacy. But that's OK and what one should expect. The location is excellent and especially as it is connected to a shopping centre - great feature in the Winter. Reception staff were excellent and check-in and out were efficient, perfectly done, fast and courteous. The room was an excellent size and sufficient amenities on the SPG Preferred Floor. I had a room that overlooked the city on the 34th floor and it was very nice. Biggest complaint would be that I could hear every word from my neighbour in the neighbouring room. There is virtually no sound insulation for the doors that adjoin rooms. I'd imagine his work desk was right beside the set of (closed) doors and I could hear every word of his conference call - great for corporate espionage. My neighbour also woke up at 0455 on Wed as I could hear his alarm as well. He took a further call that lasted about 15 minutes and watched TV. You get the picture - avoid rooms with connecting doors. The rooms have beautiful flat screen TV's but you'll be disappointed there is no cable to actually enjoy anything good. Room was very clean. Westin beds are legendary. Internet is 19$ for two days. Not bad for costs nowadays but other hotels offer it for free. Gym is not bad with plenty of cardio machines but the weights area is crowded. Gym is a bit tired, pool was full of kids. Breakfast was a limited buffet - good quality, but the same every day. Serving staff was good and efficient however. An objection in principle would be the hotels' environmental approach to things. The hotel (Westin) waxes lyrical about \"wellness\" and tries to play on themes of being green, etc. There is an opt-out option for housekeeping which garners $5 per day in a gift card or 500 Starwood points. This is a nice option but let's get real - this is for labour savings, not because laundry is being spared. I took advantage of this programme and appreciated it but have no illusions it was for the environment. It's hypocritical of the hotel not to have a simple recycling programme for the bottles of water I consumed at the hotel; newspapers that I read or other rubbish. A master light switch would have also encouraged some real 'green' practices. Come on, who are you fooling? A good hotel and would stay here again.

The lobby and other public areas on the lower floors appear to be newer than the hallways leading to the rooms. The hallway on the SPG floor seemed worn and outdated. Flourescent lights, low ceiling, that kind of thing. Not as new or updated as the Westin Times Square, for example. We entered our room which was spacious and clean; definitely up to Westin's standards. Decor is standard Westin decor; neat and modern. Heavenly bed was on par with other Westins. However, the bathroom was quite small and looked worn. Tub tile surround looked worn as did the walls and bathroom door. Housekeeping was efficient and unintrusive. We ordered room service on several occasions. Each time our order was 100% correct and food was tasty and of the appropriate temperature. Room service also arrived within the time promised, which was never more than 30 minutes. A good job for a hotel that was booked with several weddings and a convention all at the same time. The location of this hotel is ideal for sightseeing and shopping on Newbury Street. It is linked by a skybridge to the Copley Square mall. You can continue through the mall to the Marriott where you can board the various trolley tours that operate in Boston. Also, the service at this hotel was excellent. All points of contact were friendly and efficient. This is why one of the reasons why we consistently choose Westin. I would definitely return to this hotel when visiting Boston in the future.

Was an amazing city!! So much character, lots to do. Loving all the history!! When I return again, I will probably choose a different hotel. This place is just average and for the price, I think you can find a better gem. The location is great. It connects via a mall to the Marriott and the Prudential building. Very near Newbury street with lots of fun shopping. Central and a great location to start your Boston site seeing. For the hotel itself, I think it is a Westin that is going a little downhill. Lobby could use a remodel and the rooms seem old. Bathroom has chipped tile, a toilet you always have to flush twice, and they are pretty skimpy on the bathroom toiletries. No shower gel, face soap, cotton swabs, whatnot. They do have a pool and gym, both pretty clean but modest. I prefer a hotel where the price is what it is, and find it pretty annoying that you have to pay extra each day for internet in your room. Yes, this is frequently the case at many hotels, but I think it's tacky. Just add $9 per day to the price of the room and include it! Who doesn't travel with their computer these days? I like a hotel that pays attention to the details of just making their guest feel provided for, and this goes against this. Oh! and what I find the most annoying is these mini-bars where you're charged if you just touch something. Ever bring home left overs from an amazing dinner and just want a fridge to place it in for the night? I bought a bunch of Cannolies from Mike's Pastries (in the North End Italian Village - which is amazing!) and I needed to keep them chilled but could not in lame mini-bar. Annoying and wasteful. A hotel should pay attention to the simple details that make their customer's visit easy and hassle free. The Westin does not. Last, the walls are thin and early in the am, all the conference travelers are leaving their rooms about 7:15 am and IT IS LOUD. No sleeping in here! Wish I had earplugs. BUT, with that said, the Westin Heavenly beds are great! I love the white, feels very clean and the bed is so comfortable. Overall, it's not bad.

Everyone in hotel was extremely helpful when we asked for directions around town or to store our luggage the day of checkout. Elevators move super quick and there are a lot of them. Compared to the marriott downtown magnificent mile in middle of chicago, this hotel had a quieter, classier feel to it. It had the same great access to shopping as mag mile in chicago. We didn't have to go outside to access 2 malls (those in prudential center and those connected to the marriott copley place). Starbucks was at bottom of our hotel, duck tour across street, and the entrance to t can be seen from front of hotel. We walked a nice walk in rain to fenway park past a long stretch of gardens and beautiful town homes. There is a 5 story BU bookstore/barnes and nobles on that walk, pizzeria uno, and a cheap, delicious bagel store. Very disappointed with California Pizza, but that was truly the only low point of our trip (and it is not actually part of Westin, just in mall). The great thing about the Westin is that you can come back to your room at end of day tired, and just go out steps away to public library, the pru, and shopping. Saw a CVS within a block. Bathrooms in this Westin are a good size (better lay out than I have seen at other 4 stars so easy to move around). They leave nice smelling white tea shampoo and conditioner, and soap carved like a leaf. Starbucks coffee packets in room and they always left 2 caffeinated ones. This is a big deal. I can't stand getting only 1 measley cup of coffee to start day. The cups were to-go cups with lids (and large). TV was a flat-screen and beds were heavenly beds. Robes in room and no odd charges for refrig as I heard about (although we didn't even try to touch it). The lobby area has low lighting, candles, and tons of couches in different directions. It's on a second floor and just a great place for teens to sit while parents get directions. It rained our entire trip and staying here with view and malls made a huge difference for my teen. He had plenty to entertain him without going far. He gave rave reviews on the huge barnes and nobles in the mall and brookstone with its gadgets and foot massager at the end of the day. I don't know when he turned into a teen, but the museums held almost no interest for him and the malls a lot. He slept until 12 every day and housekeeping never once knocked on my door before then. Yet they always refreshed our entire room in afternoons. So again, hotel was a big plus. One change I may have made is to take a taxi to hotel from airport.

Just wandered to find a place for dinner on Fri nite without a reservation with my Dad. We walked into the Atlantic Fish Co on Boylston and had a great dinner appetizer, bottle of wine and main course for $50 each and stayed for about 2 hours. At no time were we rushed. The room was booked but we got in as a reservation was a no show. Try the Cape Cod Bluefish. Appetizer was Ipswich belly clams which was very lightly breaded and tasty but not many for the money. But, this was dinner in Boston and if you really want belly clams you need to go to the Clam Shack on Wollaston Beach or some similar place. Breakfast on Saturday was at Joe's American on Newbury. Again, a little expensive but I must say my pancakes with a berry compote inside were some of the best ever. During the day Saturday, we took a ride to Nantasket. If you have never gone there, the views from Point Allerton are really spectacular as you look towards Boston light, the city skyline and watch the planes landing at logan. We also drove along Atlantic Av which is just south of Hull going towards Hingham which is like 17 mile drive in Carmel, Ca without the golf course-- just beautiful homes and mansions, great views of the ocean and numerous small islands and jettys. This is a great day trip less than an hour from the city instead of driving all the way to the Cape and fighting that traffic. While we had other engagements, the nightlife along Boylston was incredibly busy at every bar from Vox Populi to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Lots of people looking to see and be seen. Almost forgot, walked about a mile through the various Back Bay neighborhoods which was a great way to really see what living in Boston can be all about.

The hotel is in a great location and you can use the walkways to travel several blocks without going outside. The orange and green T lines are located a block away from the hotel. We bought a weekly pass for $15, since the daily pass was $9 and used the T often to get around the city. The library is across the street and you can get 15 minutes of free internet time. If you want to pick up grocery items there is a Shaws Market across the street from the hotel and several CVS/Walgreen stores nearby. There are several restaurants located inside the mall areas and in the Back Bay. We ate twice at Legal Seafoods (the one closest to the Westin), Au Bon Pain for breakfast each morning and lunch when we arrived, Charley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of blocks away for dinner, lunch in the North End twice. Also, we went by Modern Pastry for tiramisu which was excellent. If you want to run or walk you take Dartmouth towards the river and will be able to take the foot bridge over the road and you are on the running/walking/biking trail around the river. The hotel can give you information on a 3 or 5 mile loop. The Boston side of the river has asphalt trails and a lot of shade, but the Cambridge side has concrete sidewalks with lots of places where you can trip on uneven surfaces.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk the Freedom Trail from start to finish, but we spent some time checking out various sites along the way. We thought about going to a Red Sox game, but decided to take the tour instead. It was nice to be able to walk around the park and enjoy vantage points from several places in the stadium. By the way the green line of the T will get you a couple of blocks from Fenway. We went to the Prudential Tower to enjoy the view from the observation deck. Unfortunately half of the deck was blocked due to a special event so we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t view the entire city. This was my first trip to Boston where I could actually tour the city.

At this point I called house keeping and they said we had a do not disturb sign up, which we did.. but for 1.5 hours. Where were they the rest of the time?

Do not expect the smile if you are going to stay at this place and do not expect nice greeting and a professional maid service.

We booked online and got the internet rate which is cheap but you do have to pay in advance. For us this worked perfectly since we had appointments scheduled at the colleges anyway. The rooms were very comfortable and appeared to be recently renovated. The Heavenly bed was as soft and snuggly as they claim. I want one at home!! The bathroom was also nice and came with plenty of plush towels. I really enjoyed the complimentary Starbucks and coffee maker each morning, but there's also a Starbucks in the lobby if you like espresso drinks. Because this hotel has a walkway to the \"mall\" across the street, there's plenty of shopping and places to eat, although they are upscale, so plan on spending some money. We chose this hotel because it was centrally located for our college visits and convenient to the \"T\" (subway). We walked only a block to the green line of the T, which was great. We also found the T very easy to navigate and much cheaper than getting a cab. Not much to do at night, but that served us well. There is a nice bar in the hotel and a great Sushi place next to the Starbucks. There were also some cute gift shops in the lobby that had fun and unusual gifts. We didn't use the workout facility, but we did look in and it had plenty of machines, not just one or two. The pool was clean, but pretty small. More like a place to paddle around, not swim laps. We didn't have a car, so we didn't deal with valet service or the price of parking. You don't really need a car in this part of town since the T is so convenient. We did take a cab to the airport and we were pleased to find out what a quick ride it was. All in all, this was a great hotel and we really enjoyed our stay!

We chose to valet the car at $40/night as we arrived late and didn't want to bother with seeking alternatives, but next time we would look for a cheaper option. We didn't utilize the in/out priviliges since everything (Fenway, Newbury Street, Freedom Trail, Beacon Hill, Quincy Market, North End) was within walking distance. The only time we considered driving was for our outing to Harvard, but we were advised parking is expensive/difficult at Harvard so we opted to take the subway instead. Second, we were disappointed at the size and quality of the swimming pool. We had arrived at the Westin with every intention of enjoying the pool facilities, but decided in the end to skip the tiny, crowded pool and single-person changerooms. Enjoyed Starbucks and Au Bon Pain every morning of our trip as there were several close by. There's also a Shaw's Supermarket within walking distance.

All the facilities you need, right next to the shopping mall, and with the dollar to Sterling at the moment I shopped a lot (Jimmy Choo, Mulberry, Gucci - the best European Fashions for half the price!!). Only downside of hotel was I found the bathrooms quite small and the baths were very uncomfortable for laying down in and realxing so ended up showering (not ideal if you just want to read a book and drink a glass of wine). Not sure how prices compare in the hotel as I was expensing my costs - did seem a bit more expensive than my hotel for the week but I guess thats the location. Also couldn't believe all the taxes that get added to the cost of the room - is just ridiculous! In the UK the price advertised is what you pay inclusive of VAT. Got a lot of room service as the first day was on my own until a collegue joined me. Food was lovely but not much choice on the room service menu. Second night myself and collegue ate at the fish restaurant downstairs and was quite nice (also had breakfast there). Last year we'd been to the Barking Crab and wish we had gone back as that had been cheaper, better atmosphere and great food. That aside the quality of the food can't be faulted at the hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful....one thing that got me though was on the room service it automatically charged you a delivery fee and a tip which is fine, but when staff brought my meals I still got the impression I was supposed to tip further (which I didn't). Not sure if this was rude of me but I'd already paid a tip (according to the charge in my fee for the food) and wasn't going to tip again.

We pulled in and the valet came to greet us. The valet guys were super nice. They were quick to take our car but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rush us at all while we were getting our things out of the car. Check in was good, they were friendly and honored our request for a king bed on a high floor. The room we had was very nice. The bed was very comfortable w/ nice linens. There were snacks and a minibar with a decent assortment of items at those crazy prices that all hotels charge. Instead of purchasing any, I went downstairs to a gift shop near the check in area and bought some snacks and some sodas for MUCH less money. There are a lot of stores on this level. The bathroom in our room needed updating and it was pretty small. Not what I expected. It was just a standard boring bathroom that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find at your local Holiday Inn. Our party was held in a large ballroom. Everything was very nice, staff was great. Our only gripe was the food. It was awful. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the restaurants in the hotel b/c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at them, but the food for the party was so terrible, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we had purchased snacks at the gift shop! The next morning we woke up to a loud announcement coming from the loud speaker in our room that there was an emergency in the building and if we heard our floor called out we were to evacuate immediately. (There was a blizzard outside\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not sure where we would have been evacuated to.) Thankfully we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear our floor. Finally, check out was a breeze, easy and quick. We went down to get our car from valet and it took forever to get the car back. I know they were busy, but they should have been prepared for the amount of people checking out and had more valet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on hand. In the freezing cold, with a blizzard (no joke) outside, it took about 25 minutes for them to get the car. NOT acceptable in my book. It was nice that there was a Starbucks inside the hotel and my boyfriend grabbed us coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s while we waited.

I really don't mind shlepping the bags a bit, I like knowing where my car is (and we don't take it anywhere anyway), and it was $10 a day cheaper. The boys were thrilled to get a room on the 20th floor - the view is great. The first morning, we had breakfast in the Hunnington, and I agree with one of the posters that this buffet is nothing special, but because of the prices of the a la carte items, the buffet is the most reasonable option. Once you add in coffee and juice to $15 eggs benedict, you are spending the buffet price or more. The kids got a discounted rate - and with 3 boys age 8-12, it was worth it (even though it cost more than our dinner at the Cheesecake factory the night before).

A chef was making custom omelettes, but otherwise the food was extremely ordinary and rather cold and congealing by 9:30 a.m. when we got there.

The bed was all dressed in white linens and was the most comfy thing ever! After checking in we went for a bite to eat... we walked through the mall and went to the Pour House.

We also shopped around a little on Newbury St here and there. At night we chose the Cactus Club, very good Mexican Restaurant for some drinks. We stopped by Lir a bar/restaurant. We also stopped by Whiskeys bar/restaurant for a quick bite and Solas an Irish Pub outside the Lenox Hotel. The BAR 10 inside the hotel was definitely hoppin', but we opted to go to bed when we got back.

The employees are nice, the pool is small, but I would've jumped in! The workout area seems very legit as well. Nice equipment! You have tons of restaurants to choose from and the mall is under your feet! The next morning we took a walk to Gov't center- Quincy Market... about a 15 minute walk or so.

Quite frankly a hotel cannot get any better then this. The facility is immaculate, the location is great, and the staff is wonderful. The entire first and second floors are comprised of high end shops, restaurants, and a bar. In the sitting area are comfy couches and a fireplace. There is a huge business center and conference rooms on I think the third floor and on the fifth floor is a tremendous work out facility along with an indoor pool and hot tub. The rooms are very well appointed and are large for a city hotel. The mattresses are the heavenly sleeper you hear so much about and they were great. Lots of attention to detail right from having lots and lots of electrical outlets to having a heated fog free mirror in the bath room. Windows covered two walls, and the views were spectacular. If possible try and get a room as high up as you can for the views. The Westin is across the street from the Pru Center and related shopping (including a grocery store). The area is totally safe, very active on the street at night, and very accessible to and from all parts of the City via mass transit. Cabs were very easy to get at the hotels entrance. We received a tremendous rate of $150 through Priceline for our stay at this facility. We had heard through the grapevine that Boston is a very Priceline friendly city, and we are very glad we tried that service. Hopefully we will get the Westin again some day!!!!!!!!

I hear that the Westin normally goes for $250+/night. Before booking, I signed up for Starwood Preferred Guest Services. It was very easy - did it online. Booked room via Westin website. The Westin is in a very good location - attached to the Copley and Prudential Malls and within walking distance to Back Bay, Newbury Street, Boston Commons, etc. Lots of shops, restaurants and sights in the area.

We had originally booked a room at The Four Seasons but had to change hotels at the last minute when they were unable to offer us an additional room when the size of our party changed from 2 to 4. We were initially disappointed as we are great admirers of Four Season. However, we were seriously impressed by every aspect of our stay at the Westin. Our children's deluxe room was upgraded to a corner Junior Suite adjoining ours on 31st floor with amazing panoramic views over the whole cityscape and the Charles River. The Westin 'Heavenly Bed' more than lived up to its name and the amenities in the room were excellent. The service we experienced during our stay was exemplary and of the highest order. The genuine warmth of every member of staff we encountered was reflected in the amazing friendliness and hospitality which we experienced from the citizens of Boston. The people of Scotland pride themselves on their reputation for being a hospitable nation but we found the people of Boston to be just as warm and welcoming and friendly. It would be wrong to single any member of staff out for praise but Dan? the concierge was as professional and impressive as any concierge we have ever come across and we have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world. The breakfast restaurant serves a lovely selection of fresh and delicious dishes. Room service - with the award winning Clam Chowder from Turners in house restaurant - was first class with a huge choice. We found the prices to be fantastic value - well we would do as the UK pound is so strong against the US dollar at present! The Westin is attached by a convenient walkaway to an amazing shopping mall with many major high end outlets such as Saks of Fifth Avenue, Louis Vuitton, Niemann Marcus etc. We have been home now for three days and I still need to use asbestos gloves to handle my Amex!!! :0) I can thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston for whatever reason.

You might however think the Westin name and the corporate standards around that name will provide some guarantees of quality, service and fairness in pricing. You might not be impressed. For starters -- the hotel is well located, generally in good condition and the staff want to be helpful. But it does seem like the finance department is really the ones running the hotel and they have found virtually every little way they can to get more money out of your pocket and into theirs. Does anybody else remember a time when you booked a hotel room, you might pay a 50 or 100 per uplift/surcharge for using the phone, and the restaurants and gift shops were only nominally more expensive than the general area? What happened to those days? The significant other and I selected the Westin based on location and availability for a quick five and a half day (long) weekend around Labor Day 2007. We booked a \"standard\" room, and showed up late in the evening of our designated arrival. So far -- no problems. Being that it was late (approaching midnight), we decided to order a quick bite for dinner. We know that room service isn't cheap but being tired and hungry and unwilling to go forage for food in a new town at a late hour we ordered away - one steak quesadilla, one shrimp cocktail and two sodas. Now I wasn't expecting to get this at Taco Bell prices, but when I saw the room service ticket and they wanted me to pay $56.00 I was really unhappy. In all fairness the shrimp (4) were larger than my thumb and the meal was presented with a sprig of parsley. But 8 oz bottles of soda for $4.50 each, a mandatory gratuity, a delivery charge, a convention tax and another miscellaneous fee or two ran a ridiculous bill into the a whole new level. A trip to the front desk the next morning got an apology from the room service manager (who double checked that they hadn't made a billing error) for the above average prices. I repeated my displeasure and vowed to not use that service again during our stay. When we returned to the room that evening there was a hand written note, a tray of cheese wedges and some crackers and a bottle of \"designer\" water repeating the apology. I also found out at check out that valet parking was $40 per day - a detail that was posted on a single (small) sign in the drop area that was obscured by a bus or van when we pulled in late the first night. Can't say I remember ever paying more to park my rental car (which you generally don't need to get around downtown) than for the vehicle rental itself. But life is always full of firsts. I just wish they had topped off the gas on my rental SUV and washed and hand waxed it for those rates. Another pet peeve I have dealt with housekeeping. If you're not going to change the bedding and towels daily would you tell the customers how we can get you to do so when WE think they need changing? With no signs the hotel was \"earth friendly\" or a \"green\" hotel I expected the linens to be changed daily. By day three of the trip, I had to rip the sheets off the bed and leave them in a puddle in the bath to get them changed out. Day two when I simply piled a heap of sheets, blankets and pillows on the bed (complete with make-up stains and cracker crumbs) this was somehow interpreted as - please straighten up this mess. I guess being a seasoned traveler who has spent over a thousand nights in hotels I find these kinds of details unsettling of a property that bills itself as a luxury hotel. Seems management is running towards a bottom line and as long as the occupancy rate doesn't dip below some magic level -- they are successful. But what about how we as consumers feel after the experience of the property?

Take the T to the North End station; take the Amtrak train from the North end station and four or five stops later you are in Salem. With Plymouth you need to rent a car which we were able to do because of the Hertz desk in the lobby. You pick up and drop off curbside to the hotel. The hotel is also very close to Newberry Street. I would also recommend the Boston Pub Crawl Tour. Great stories about American history and beer. Beds and housekeeping were fine. All of you who are complaining have to remember this is Boston.

It's simply wonderful. The rooms were large and I noticed absolutely no problem with sound-proofing. A prank fire alarm did wake us up at 5:21 a.m. one morning (grrrr) but not the hotel's fault. The beds were great, everything was clean, the hotel is not ultra luxurious, but it is very nice. Some tips: There is a pen store off the lobby that will let you use the internet $5/15 min. You can charge it to the room and it's not a huge price to pay for peace of mind in clearing your e-mails. There is a great restaurant called Stephanie's Cafe on Newburry. Highly recommended! Ask for a fridge so you can go to Shaw's Grocery store and stock up on food. It definitely helps save money as the room service is pricey (as is the case in most hotels). Oh!

Westin should have seriously considered how their buildings are constructed before the \"renewed, refreshed and restored\" campaign was launched. The walls were so thin I heard EVERYTHING my neighbors did, as well as converstions of people walking down the hallways, all night long. Maid service was laughable. My comforter was taken away after the first night and never made it back. A pitcher and glasses from room service ordered on Friday night were still in the room when I left on Sunday. Finally, the air conditioner in the room never worked right. Maintenance assured me that it was cooling, and being from Texas I assumed that maybe units up north were just not designed to cool the way ours do here. Imagine my surprise when I went to a friends room in another area hotel and realized that some air conditioners in Boston actually do cool. Maybe this is why my comforter disappeared-- maybe they thought I didn't need it... The concierge service was disappointing. Yes, my request was taken care of initially by Marcos. When we needed to make a change later on, however, the new concierge on duty seemed frazzled and clueless saying she didn't know anything about my original request. After being on hold for 10 minutes she finally decided to check the log book they keep--amazing, all the information was right there! There was also a young lady at the front desk who had no clue how to handle an incoming fax for a guest. After 20 minutes of waiting in the lobby for her to figure it out, another employee finally stepped in and let me know it was waiting in my room. Just not the 'polish' I've come to expect from Westin. Most of my group was at the nearby Sheraton, but I had chosen the Westin specifically because I felt sure the bed and pillows would be perfect, and I could actually rest.

The king bed however is the huge Californian style size-wise and can fit two adults with space to spare. The Heavenly Bed is of course wonderful as always. The room is nicely appointed but I preferred the room that I had over at the Boston Sheraton. I have always liked the Westin amenities and they are fully presented here.

High-speed internet is available (via Ethernet connection) in-room for $10/day; wi-fi is available only in the lobby areas. There's a business center adjacent to the lobby where you can print and fax (for a hefty charge). Service in general was very responsive, as when I called after midnight to report that I'd forgotten to bring toothpaste and a toothbrush kit was delivered within minutes. Check-in was quick, express check-out was a no-brainer, and luggage service was easy. (Don't bring a car if you can help it: parking is $40/night and street parking is nearly impossible.) As others have reported, noise insulation from adjoining rooms is only so-so. I could at times hear TV and a child crying from the neighboring room and could also hear pipes running quite loudly from adjoining bathrooms. It wasn't terribly bothersome, though. The hotel's location is excellent, overlooking Copley Square and on the border of the Back Bay and South End. Turn north on Dartmouth Street and you're two blocks from upscale shops and restaurants on Newbury Street; a longer walk south takes you to trendy South End restaurants on Tremont Street. The hotel is attached directly to the Copley Place mall and the Prudential building, which means lots of shops and restaurants (including Legal Sea Foods, Turner Fisheries, a sushi place and several coffee shops--there's a Starbucks just off the lobby)--if the weather is bad you'll never have to go outside. Access to public transportation is great--you're a block away from the T (subway) stops at Copley (Green Line) and Back Bay (Orange Line). If you're a first-time Boston visitor I can see why you might want to stay closer to Beacon Hill or the North End, but the Public Gardens and Common are only about a 10-minute walk away, and if you're a more seasoned visitor this is probably a more fun place to be. Both the Back Bay and South End have beautiful late-19th-century architecture--well worth a stroll. One really unpleasant thing happened that's probably preventing me from giving the Westin a 5. When I arrived in my room it appeared that the bathroom had been cleaned, but when I lifted the toilet seat it was clear that the toilet had been, um, used and not flushed...I called housekeeping and then had to have a bit of a debate with the housekeepers who arrived, who insisted that they had just cleaned the bathroom and that maybe there was just soap in the bowl (believe me, that is NOT what soap looks like). I finally did get them to re-clean the toilet, but it definitely made me a little skeptical about how well they were cleaning. (My guess is that some member of the staff had used the toilet after it had been cleaned that day.)

The bed, as the name suggests, really was \"heavenly.\" I slept so soundly and comfortably on it. I loved the location -- very central, near everything, including the subway, which was right outside of the hotel. Room service menu is really nice, there's a sushi restaurant, a seafood restaurant, a cool bar, a spa, a pool, starbucks coffee in your room (and a starbucks cafe downstairs too).

If you never want to go outside, you could get to the convention center via two skybridges between the hotel and Copley Place Mall.

The Starwood guest complimentary daily Panna water ration can be very illusive. 6 days into this trip and I am still waiting and now gasping for my first bottle.

The following day we did have to agree that the bed is truly 'heavenly\" with all the pillows and fluffy covers. The pool and fitness area is top notch. The gym is not a typical hotel gym but a full work out facility with flat screen TV 's at all units and Bon Appetite and Runners world magazines all lined up and ready for reading.

Legal Seafoods is always a great choice for seafood (reasonably priced and very good). There are several locations in Boston and there's one in the Copley Plaza.

It's known for the cannolies and pastries. Lucca is a short walk from Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market. We traveled to Brookine, a suburb, for Chinese food. We ate the Golden Sham Temple. While the restaurant was very nice, the food wasn't great. If you're used to great Chinese food you'll be disappointed. The best shopping deals were found at Saks and on Newbury Street.

I had a planned vacation in Cape Cod beginning on the 8th, so decided to go early and see the fireworks. I specifically stated at the time of reservations I wanted a Riverview room to see the fireworks--much like the room I was staying in then. I was not told there would be a problem. I rearranged my plane reservations to arrive on the 4th (instead of the 8th) in time for fireworks --and flew all day from California with my son. When I arrived, I was told that there were no more riverview rooms available! I was shocked. I am a long term SPG member and stay at Starwood properties several times a year. AFter much wrangling, I was told I could be put in a room on the 17th floor and I would be able to see the fireworks. I was not --they were blocked by the building in front of my room. I was told that my reservation \"guaranteed me a room\" not the type of room I'd reserved. I understand that the 4th is a very busy time in Boston, with a lot of demand for views of the River...but if there was a problem, they should have told me that no rooms with a view were available when I made the reservation....or I would have thought someone would have contacted me if there was a problem since I was an SPG member. I was very upset as was my son. I wrote a detailed letter to the CEO of the Starwood, as well as the General Manager of the Westin the next day....and have yet to receive a response from either (over a month later).

So much for a heavenly rest in their heavenly beds. 3) Service at one of the hotel restaurants, Bar 10, was terrible.

The gym, however, is spacious and well-equipped. The rooms are relatively large, though plainly outfitted, with no real sense of style and the bathroom was quite small, given the size of the room. All of this would be semi-acceptable at Holiday Inn prices, but this hotel charges a lot of money for their rooms.

Upon checkin, we were first given a room that had recently had the carpet cleaned (carpet still wet; furniture on bed). We called immediately, and they moved us (after a 15-min. wait) to another room; somewhat annoying, but not a problem. More annoying was the fact that the person who checked us in told my spouse that we could not cancel our last night's stay (last of 4 nights) - that the policy was that we had to cancel any night's stay 24 hours prior to our initial arrival (FYI, separate item, room price quoted as $256). That may be the policy, and we messed up. He did upgrade us to a riverview room to compensate for our not being able to check out a day early (spouse booked too many days by mistake). Then I called the Westin Reservations number from our hotel room, and made the same request to cancel - the woman on the phone said that yes, we could cancel that last night, which she did, and I had her email the confirmation to my blackberry. She also mentioned our room price was $297, and we had 4 adults; I said no, 2 adults, 2 kids, and we thought the price was $256; she fixed all that as well. The next morning, I checked at the front desk to make sure everything had been fixed. That woman still had us for a 4-night stay, but cancelled that last night with no comment; she had us down as 2 adults, 2 kids, at $236. So in the end, we got a cheaper rate than originally, for a better room, and the number of nights we had planned. And we may have misunderstood the Westin's cancellation policy, and only got what we wanted by getting around the system. But it was still a bureaucratic hassle. I'm not a chain hotel sort of person in general (prefer small family-run hotels), but do stay at chains occasionally. I only recently have heard about Westin's heavenly beds; I didn't notice that they were any different; but maybe that's because the bed was similar to mine at home.

We paid $479 for a \"Riverview Deluxe\" room and I'm so sorry we did. The room was incredibly ordinary. Although the view across rooftops to the Charles was nice, it wasn't worth the money. The shower was good, but the tub didn't drain. The climate control didn't work properly (we were hot) and the bathroom was small -- needing renovation and new grout. The beds were very comfy. The location is excellent -- attached to the shopping centers. The oddly-shaped and dark lobby was always crowded with convention-goers and business people. Overall, this is a business hotel and wildly overpriced. You'd do much better across the street at the Copley Plaza, where for a little less money you get much more style and grandeur. Or, for the same price, choose the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, a few blocks away, but much nicer and on the park. My favorite hotel rooms in Boston are the harbor view rooms at the Boston Harbor Hotel (at Rowes Wharf). Those rooms are plush, gorgeous, updated and have amazing views. The hotel is much friendlier and service-oriented. It's just a short walk from there to Quincy Market, Copley or downtown.

As regular Westin customers, we were highly disappointed. It wasn't uncomfortable, but a far cry from the plush bed and linens that we are accustomed to. The Bed is why we pay a little extra to stay at The Westin in the first place. Secondly, we had some service problems. We arrived at 3:30pm after a long day of travel, hoping to nap the baby (9 mos) for at least an hour before heading out to a scheduled event at 6pm. At the check in desk, I emphasized that we needed a crib in the room ASAP; in fact, I mentioned it 3 times. In spite of a couple additional phone calls, the crib never came. I made one final call as we left and it was finally there upon our return to the room at 8pm. They make a big deal out of having the \"Heavenly Crib\" and they gave our kids nice \"Westin Kids' Club\" ball caps, yet they failed to truely recognize the most important needs of their smallest guests when it mattered the most. Finally, the battery on our door lock was dead, so the keys kept failing. After several frustrating trips down to the front desk to gain reentry into our room, they finally sent someone up to check the lock... I don't know... it didn't occur to me at the time that that would be the problem, but now it seems so obvious. And don't they have hundreds of these locks? Shouldn't that have been their first (or at least second) troubleshooting action? Otherwise, the room was nice and our stay reasonably comfortable. The bathroom had a granite counter but ordinary tile shower. The workout room was fine, but pool too small for anything useful (my 4 yr old son found it boring and I couldn't swim laps). The location is great: all the shops and restaurants you need in the ajoining malls, Shaw's grocery, two minute walk to the famous Boston Duck Tours, T stations very close. No need for a car. We had a Jr. Suite for $249 - a huge room, although the space was not devided. We requested an upper floor and got a gorgeous harbor view. On the 3rd of July, we could see about a dozen fireworks displays (of surrounding communities) from our window (didn't stay the nt of the 4th). As bad as I make the stay out to be, it was a reasonable value (room size, location). I can overlook the crib and key problems because \"stuff happens\" and employees are human, but the non-Heavenly Bed really bugged me.

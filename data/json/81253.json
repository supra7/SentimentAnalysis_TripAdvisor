But it was so noisy that we can\u9225\u6a9b sleep; so we turn it off and use our clothes for keep us warm through the night. Carpet in the room was very dirty. There was no heater in bathroom, so it was cold. There was no refrigerator and microware in the room that is unusual for Travelodge hotels. We were charged additional $14 per day for parking, but even so you should look for a free spot for a long time in 3 hotel parking lots, that next door restaurant uses as well. But the worst thing was smell in the room \u9225?my wife got allergy and just now, after a week, is recovering from it. I have stayed in few Travelodge hotels before, and I can say that this one doesn\u9225\u6a9b correspond to Travelodge standards \u9225?actually, to any standard.

At bedtime we could not sleep because the walls are paper thin and the guy beside us was snoring sooo loud we felt like he was in bed with us. We tried sleeping the opposite way on the bed, but no luck, so eventually we had to call front desk and switch rooms. (I have never done this before!) They gave us a way nicer, cleaner, quieter room the second time. It was fine, and if my original experience was the second room I would have a lot more nice things to say. It wasn't fun carting suitcases at 11:30pm.. but oh well. The next day we were able to walk to most of the famous downtown sites from our hotel.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Total Disgrace to Hotels I wish I had not taken word of the few good reviews that were posted. I should have known better being a travel agent. I booked this based on price and location. If you do not get anything else from this review, get this - you get what you pay for!This hotel is horrible! Here is a list of what happened to us in just the 3 nights we were there:1. Our room was attacked by termites on night 2. They were in our cosmetic bag, our lamps, under furniture, flying around the room, and crawling in our shoes. The front desk staff said This is termite season and that was it.*Upon asking for another room, we were walked two blocks to an adjacent building with a dark and scary courtyard. Outside of the room next to the door was a huge cockroach the size of my hand (and I am not exaggerating). We decided to stick it out with the termites. Only 1 night left of our stay.2. Our door to the patio could have been easily kicked in as it was wood slats and the locks were broken. Since we were on ground level we were concerned of someone breaking in.3. We were right outside of the breakfast station and we watched the pigeons eating the food prior to the guests coming to get it.4. The bed sheets had holes, stains, and hair.5. The furniture was so old and some tables were wobbling.6. The room smelled of mold and dampness7. Carpets had to be 30 years old.8. The bathroom had ceiling leaks and the sink did not work properly.I had never felt unsafe anywhere I have traveled until this trip. We didn't even want to return to the hotel each day. We kept our socks on it bed and walking around the room, and the whole place killed the mood. I actually cried one night. Our complaints went unnoticed by the staff and I never received a return call from the manager even though I left 3 messages.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR239714608", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SavageTraveler"}, {"Content": "Great location - Disgusting room The St. Helene has a great location, and the potential to be charming, quaint and romantic.

We were booking our hotel a little late in the game, and this was the cheapest hotel I could find online (seriously--I mean the one with the absolute LOWEST rate) in the French Quarter, but it looked so cute in the pictures. And it was! (How often does it happen that the cheapest place is also the best?) Beautiful balconies on the outside (the kind of place that made you feel like you were really in New Orleans). We stayed in a room on the first floor towards the back. It was small, but beautifully decorated (i.e., not the standard-issue orange graphic-print comforter all the chain hotels seem to have). Antique-looking furniture. And the location couldn't be better for hanging out on Bourbon Street. I was a little worried beforehand that we'd be up all night due to the noise of Mardi Gras, but we couldn't hear a peep from our room.

We enjoyed the balcony greatly. We can not say the same for overall situation. I can only assure the reader we were polite at all times in dealing with the personnel, though on a couple of occaisions they were less than gracious to us. PROBLEM (1) On a three night stay only when we checked in was the bed made and fresh towels in the room as they should have been. After the first night the room was made up around 5 in the afternoon after we called the front desk. After the second night the room was never made up, though we brought it to the front desk's attention around 3 in the afternoon. I went down and got fresh towels around 10:30 when we got back to our room. NOTE: The clerk had to raid towels from another room that was unoccupied. PROBLEM (2) They have no ice machine and some rude front desk people. The first evening I went down and asked for ice which the desk person gave me from some bags in a freezer that is in a side office right beside the front counter. The second afternoon (when the room was late being made up) my wife went down for ice and the clerk said they had no ice and SENT HER TO ANOTHER HOTEL AROUND THE CORNER, which she did. When she returned and told me what had happened, I went down to the front desk and politely asked for ice to which the clerk said there was none. I asked Don't you have a freezer or cooler for ice? The clerk said 'No'. So I went around the side of the partition, opened the freezer and found three bags of ice. I asked if it was OK for me to use some of that ice. He said, in an unbecoming tone, that he thought they were out of ice and yes I could have some ice. I was polite at all times, all I wanted was ice (and my room made up). PROBLEM (3) The building has maintenance problems. The elevator didn't work half the time. Two big floor tiles were loose in the bathroom. The closet door would not open because it was being used to hold the A/C vent in the ceiling closed. One of the two lamps in the bedroom bulb burned out and was never replaced. The carpet badly needed vacuuming. There was low water pressure and the hot water never got much over slightly warm. PROBLEM (4) When we checked out, we discussed the situation with the manager. She apologized and promised a refund of one nights room rate. We're still waiting as of this date, two months later.", "Date": "Jun 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR411604966", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great location and price I am a budget traveler, the price was right so I booked however upon making my reservations at this hotel I discovered many bad comments about the property.

Sometimes our room was not touched by housekeeping and we had to request towels from the front desk. The front desk staff were awesome though, well one in particular.

Not only was she a stunningly beautiful Goddess who brightened up our day each time we stepped foot into the lobby of this rhymes with spit hole, she was also very nice and friendly, and she went above and beyond her duties to make sure we were happy, a hard thing to do in a place like the Ste. Helene. She earned her pay that week, even though she was front desk she was everywhere trying to clean up messes at this place. Her supermodel looks, beautiful smile, and incredible personality more than made up for the crappy state of the hotel.

Also, phone calls are very exspensive so I would suggest a cell.

Our door knob came off in our hand the first night and was never fixed. No mattress cover or fitted sheet on the bottom so you fight with keeping the bottom sheet on the bed. The bedspread looked as if it had been washed million times with rolls of the cotton backing coming off. One day no bath mat, one day no hand towels. Bed headboard not attached to the bed. We were afraid of being whacked in the head at night. Luckily we only stayed in the room to sleep-quite an adventure in itself with the street noise. The only parking is across the street at a U Park garage. Definitiely don't use that one because they tried to rip us off and became very confrontational and belligerent.

We should have learned the first time we stayed there and encountered filthy carpets, stained furniture, and really really moldy bathrooms. They are in a perfect location and supposedly have a new owner so we bit, and stayed there again, however, nothing could have prepared us for our recent 5 night stay during mardi gras. We are pretty laid back, and we travel to New Orleans about every 8-10 weeks to enjoy the city. We have stayed all over town in different types of lodgings ie; bed and breakfasts, condo rentals, big chain hotels, etc. In our travels here we have encountered lots of typical new orleans plagues and rolled with it, but the Saint Helene has proven to be the most disgusting both times. Someone barfed ALOT into a potted plant that was directly at the bottom of the stairs that lead up to all the rooms. It happened our 2nd night and was still there, untouched when we left days later. There was another staircase that had a used condom on the tread that appeared our third night and was never removed. At the top of the stairs was a huge, thick, pool of bird poop from many birds over time that was unavoidable but easily could have been washed away. The staff never cleaned our room, never replaced the glasses (5 nights, same glasses, we found plastic ones at a bar!) The sheets had old blood stains on the edge and the staff remade the bed with the same linens after I requested new ones the first night. Old dried soap foam stalactites on the metal soap holder in the shower. Old whisker shavings over the bathroom surfaces. The bathroom mirror was not framed (and had very sharp edges) or attatched to the wall! It was resting on the sink!! Sooo Dangerous!!! We went to the desk to get more toilet paper and tissue when we ran out as the phone had no numbers to call for desk help and no directory. Nice wood floors had huge dust bunnies. The room itself was quite large but looked comically empty as there was only one chair, a bed, and a floor lamp. No tables! No place to put anything! We asked if they had ANY sort of table, tv tray, banquet table, anything! They said no. There was more, but this has become a novel. We paid 180.00 per night here, and in another hotel it would have been fair for the dates and location. This was money truly thrown away. Avoid this place like the plaque!!

You find the same type of atmosphere if you visit the older countries of Europe. Yes, it is not your typical Marriot or Days Inn. It has its own ambience and the real feel of old New Orleans. and Yes, the carpets could use some cleaning but I've seen worse in French Quarter hotels.

Basically the hotel is clean but very run-down and shabby and one does not expect that given the current room rates. Although, the hotel is in a safe and convenient area of the French Quarter--not much else is good about it. The hotel ad promises free champagne or cocktails nightly--which never did materialize, although we were there 4 nights! We were given various excuses by different desk clerks, who change daily so no body is accountable. Desk clerks themselves are a problem as they will give you erroneous information--I was misled about a literary walking tour, by a desk clerk, which made me miss the tour! There is a pool but it was full of leaves while we were there and no body attempted to clean it until the morning we left! The continental breakfast is adequate--coffee and rolls, or muffins--self-service. Rooms staff is friendly, clean towels daily.

We were ALL upgraded to suites, each with a jaxuzzi tub... the guest of honor stayed in an awesome suite, room 202, I think, jacuzzi for 4, great decor, sitting room and balcony. One of the funnest trips we've taken. Hospitality was great, breakfast every morning, plenty of hot water, comfy beds, it was a nawlins' experience. There is no pool. Excellent location, close to everything and not too far from Bourbon St. This is were we stayed our first trip to New orleans, we've been back and stayed in one of the hotel casinos... no ambiance there.

Its not much bigger than a child's wading pool and has green scum growing in it. Hotel took the liberty of over charging my credit card and the desk clerk refused to issue a refund .

(This review is a bit late because I only recently discovered this wonderful website.) My first visit to New Orleans in 2002 was ruined by the Ste-Helene Hotel experience. As the other reviewers report, it is rather disgusting. Old, dirty, a/c didn't work and lots of dripping noises. Fake advertising is the only way they get guests to come, I guess. When I first checked in, my room was so hideous and nightmarish that I went back to the reception and requested a better room. Okay, they were accommodating and did assign me another room but it was only a marginal improvement. At least it didn't look creepy, dark and gothic - but still old and filthy. Being without resources, I told myself to suck it up for the 3 nights. How much time does one spend in a hotel room. But it really does affect your mental state if you don't get any sleep over 3 nights.

We never even tried to find the continental breakfast or happy hour, but the staff never told us it was available, either.

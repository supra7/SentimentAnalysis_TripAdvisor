The bathrooms could use updating but otherwise the rooms have very comfortable beds with large flat screen TVs. Our flight came in a little late and so we missed the complimentary shuttle by 5 minutes and had to take a pricey cab out to the hotel which was sad. The hotel website does advertise that their shuttle is not 24 hours. Booking the cruise shuttle through the hotel was confusing but ended up working out well. I heard that Hyatt Place is changing their breakfast to serve hot breakfast items on a complimentary basis which would be good seeing as though most people are looking for a more expanded breakfast for free these days. But the food was good and fully stocked and the hotel was very clean over all! We sat out by the pool which was nice and peaceful and the area was also very clean.

Something you may want to prepare for the next time you have a large booking. The rooms were of nice size with compfy beds and the extra large TV was a really nice perk, although the bathroom leaves much to be desired. It is extremely small and outdated.

Even with directions it took a little finding. We were checked in and advised where the hotel facilities were. A request for food was met with 'check what we have at the counter'. I knew a 24 hour menu was available so asked husband to sort this and took our luggage on up to the room. He came up with 4 sandwiches and 4 bottled sodas which cost $40. The room was spacious though the bathroom was small. We had 2 doubles and a large sofa which converted to a sofa bed. The TV was large and there was also a fridge and coffee maker. The air conditioning unit was very loud and could be heard throughout the night. The room was adequate but obviously well used and the carpet made our socks very dirty. We went for breakfast, which was complimentary, in the morning and it was absolutely heaving. It was hard to find seating and queues were long. The food was basic but served our purposes. It consisted of tea, coffee or juice, fruit, cereal, toast and pastries. There was a small pool to the side of the hotel but we didn't use it.

The hotel was modern and clean. The rooms were excellent -- our room had two beds and the bathroom in the sleeping area, plus a separate sitting area with a large L-shaped sofa, a desk, and a small wet bar with a coffee maker and mini-fridge, and there was a big flat screen TV in between the two areas so you could watch it from either side. One really nice thing about this hotel is that you can go down to the lobby and order freshly-made food, any time of the day or night, and the prices are reasonable (not cheap, but they don't screw you over either) My husband and I arrived quite late and hungry from our trip, and went down to the lobby where he got some chili and a glass of wine, and I just had wine. The wine was pretty good, especially for being a house brand. I think the wine was about $7 per glass, and they had lots of other wines, beers, and cocktails, plus coffee, salads, soups, sandwiches, personal sized pizzas, cakes, muffins, apples, etc. It was really nice to not have to leave the hotel to get food, being as it was late and we didn't have rental car. The bedding was very comfortable, and the room was clean and everything appeared to be relatively new. There were plenty of towels, and complimentary soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and toothpaste in the room when we checked in. I think this would be a great place to stay, especially for business travelers, as it has everything you would need after a long day of work, and the desk area is optimized for working, with plugs for almost any type of device next to the desk and TV. We also thought the staff was just wonderful, very friendly and welcoming, especially the night shift guy, who served us our dinner and drinks, and was still there when we went down for breakfast in the morning. The free breakfast was standard breakfast fare with a better than average selection of juices and drinks. One thing to note is that the free shuttle only runs from 5am-11pm, and only goes to the airport once an hour, so you may want to spend the extra money on a taxi or rental car. We took a taxi from MIA since it was late and we didn't want to wait, and it was a little over $20 one way, then took the shuttle back to MIA in the morning.

The \"restaurant\" is apparently the cold food case they have that sits rather awkwardly close to the check in desk. They did have a pretty decent breakfast set up, but seating was very limited.

I think they must have been training staff while we were there, as their food/snack area was not fully stocked and had minimal selection - and there were no drink or snack machines in the hotel. The only fly in the ointment was the airport shuttle service. We had been instructed to call the hotel when we returned to Miami, for a shuttle pick up. We did so (returned on a Sunday evening) and were told the shuttle would be there to pick us up in 15 minutes. When he did show up 30 minutes later, the shuttle was full and we were told we would have to wait for the next pickup. Looking at a drive of 1 1/2 hours at 8 pm on a Sunday, we were not happy. I will commend the staff, however, as when I called the hotel back to report my dissatisfaction, they immediately told me to take a cab and they would pay the fare. Even better, my car was in exactly the same condition I had left it 13 days prior!!", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hyatt Place Miami Airport-West/Doral", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d87107-Reviews-Hyatt_Place_Miami_Airport_West_Doral-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$141 - $191*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3655 Northwest 82nd Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33122</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87107", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/19/0e/190e55176377e5703cf33904107bbefd5large.jpg"}}

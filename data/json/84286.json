That is a treat when you are in Los Angeles! We had good hot breakfast! A pity as a priority club member, I did not receive any recognition for my 3 nights stay! We did not experience any fire sirens until the last day but the walls are thin, so we could hear the alarm clock ringing from next door or someone taken ill, coughing her heart out! The red line station is just 5 minutes away, so convenient to walk to but the neighborhood feels sleazy so I was uncomfortable walking out when it turns dark.

My check-in experience was smooth and efficient. Door access to the room uses a proximity reader rather than having to rely upon a magnetic strip being swiped in a traditional card reader. Just hold the plain white card near the black circle above the door handle, and voila! This is a former Ramada Limited, so the WiFi SSID is \"ramada\" even though the instructions say to select \"Holiday Inn Express on Wi-Fi\". Though I wasn't given the internet access code at check-in, a quick call to the front desk is all that was required. As for speed, I was able to squeeze 2.1 Mbps down and 0.37 Mbps up using speedtest.net. Not exactly stellar rates, but it seemed marginally useful. Your authentication with the hotel's proxy seems to be reset at random times. You'll be working along, and everything just stops. Upon opening a new web page, you're redirected to the hotel's proxy authentication. It really became quite irritating. Ultimately, I had to switch to my Verizon cellular modem because even with authentication, the hotel's network kept losing connectivity with the internet. This is a major failure on the part of a \"hospitality\" company. The desk area is adequately sized with a nice lamp and two electrical outlets. Be prepared to use something as a mouse pad, because optical mice do not like the faux granite finish on the desktop. An exceptionally noisy exhaust fan is on the same switch with the bathroom light -- a major sore point with me, which you'll know if you've read any of my other reviews. Hospitality folks, please, it's not rocket science: Separate switches for the bathroom light and fan. Judging from the bullet-proof glass I found across the counter at a nearby Jack-in-the-Box, this isn't the greatest part of town. My experience walking to and from the Westlake / MacArthur Park subway station confirmed this suspicion. Making my way through the trash, filth, disrepair, homeless, and hucksters, I felt lucky to make the short walk four days in a row without being mugged. Do not go out at night unless you are driving your locked car to a better part of Los Angeles (if such a place exists). Wednesday, I returned to my room at 4:10 PM to find that it had yet to be cleaned. Perhaps this is normal, but the hotel isn't exactly overrun with guests. I would have thought the occupied rooms could have been cleaned well before that time. Dominos Pizza delivers to this hotel. So does Tg Original Express if you like Thai or Chinese. I would not recommend going out at night on foot. I would scarcely recommend going out during the day on foot! Your personal safety will definitely be in peril. This is a nice, freshly-renovated HIE property, but the surrounding neighborhood is utterly awful. I'm sad to say that means I will be staying elsewhere if I return to Los Angeles. And that's a shame because all of the people who work at this property are terrifically warm, friendly, and helpful. The people should get five stars, the property four, and the area less than ZERO. So it averages out to three which is my rating.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNow a Holiday Inn Express & Suites!\u201d", "Author": "jkhotels", "ReviewID": "UR121435639", "Content": "Was a little wary on booking at this hotel but overall it was better than I expected! This newly refreshed Holiday Inn Express & Suites is a BIG improvement over the Ramada Limited it used to be. Heard from management that this was a multi-million renovation and you can tell! Easy to find with a GPS - area is a typical Los Angeles area, you have you good and bads. Did not have a problem with safety at this property like a couple people have mentioned in previous reviews. Front Desk was a little confused on how to do a couple things at check in but that is understandable as they just opened and going from Ramada to a IHG hotel is a complete change. Asked for directions and recommendations and they were spot on ready to help. A plus is parking is free here! Rooms were very nice - I'm even thinking about getting the wallpaper in my own house. Very modern and very new. Had a room right by the elevator but never heard it and never heard any doors slamming. However, I will make a note to management that the the hotel could use some attention to details. The windows at the end of the hallway had paint from the exterior splattered on them, baseboards and walls have knicks from what looks like the furniture, carpets on the outside of the elevator are worn and getting a little dirty, and in the bathroom of the room I was in the faucet holes were too big for the actual fixture. Nothing big but overtime could cause some ware. Cool feature is that this hotel has new keylocks where you slide the key over the reader on the doorknob - thought it was pretty neat. Breakfast, unlike other Holiday Inn Express properties, did not have the pancake machine. Wanted to try that out - but I am sure they will soon get one. Standard breakfast as expected. Tip for the breakfast lady is that to get a new tray for the bacon - the dish the bacon is put in does not do anything about the puddle of grease it soaks in. Definitely recommend giving this hotel a shot. About a 20 minute drive to The Grove and there was a beautiful park - rare to find in LA - about 10 minutes away.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hope, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBAD LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Miker023", "ReviewID": "UR118743098", "Content": "We booked an overnighter here and the hotel is in the middle of a very seedy part of town.

Unfortunately, because Jorge would not provide us with a supervisor on the premise and would not honor the request, we are going to have to complain the following day to reach the supervisor on Monday.

When we arrived at check-in, the desk associate by the name of Monica made check-in the most difficult of situations. We had a pre-paid reservation in hand, which stated we had requested a non-smoking room. Monica informed us that we were in the computer for a smoking room and that she could not do anything to change it. She then handed us the keys to this smoking room. When we arrived at the room, the room had not yet been cleaned (beds un-made,trash in waste baskets). This was very upsetting, check in for this hotel is 2pm, we arrived at the hotel @4:15pm. I then went back down stairs only to have her inform us that we had to wait 20-30 minutes for the room to be cleaned. My husband and I waited in the lobby for almost 10 minutes, the I began to question her because the hotel looked as though it was empty. I asked why we just couldn't have another room. She responded that it was because I was rude to her. She then checked the computer, and gave us another room. When we arrived at room #2 this room was un-cleaned as well. When I got down to the desk and explained to her, her excuse was that the cleaning woman was late that day, no apology. The then gave me a 3rd room key for the room that we ultimately stayed in. After a long flight you can imagine this was very fustrating. Especially since I was informed that the manager was not present and would not available until Monday 8/31. If that wasn't enough, the next incident occured the very next evening. Monica was on duty. The iron in our room took 10 minutes to heat and when it did, water was draining from the bottom of the iron onto our clothing. I called down to the desk and asked Monica for an iron. She told me no problem and that she would take care of it. I waited for 20 minutes with no response, so finally I went down to the lobby. I asked her what the status was on our iron and she stated that unfortunately she was the only one there and that she could probably get me an iron in the morning. I asked her why she didn't tell me that over the phone and why she had me under the impression that we would soon be recieving an iron. We needed the iron because we were on our way out to celebrate by husband's birthday and could not wait until morning. She then called the security guard to assist by getting another iron from one of the other rooms. This gentleman was extremely helpful and pleasant.The next morning I went down and informed the desk manager of all that had occurred. She wrote down the information that I had given her and told me that she would get Monica's side and she would get back with me. She was apologetic at that point in time, but that changed. We left the hotel overnight, but returned on the evening of 9/1. When we checked out the next morning, I had asked the desk associate for a reciept or a copy of the credit card inprint that they took at the time of checkin for my records. She informed me that there was no reciept because we had a pre-paid reservation. I again asked for the desk manager. She can out and she told the associate that it was okay to give a copy of the inprint. She also gave me an update of the situation with Monica. This time she was not apologetic and stated that the only reason why I was inconvienced was because there was an error in the computer as far as the rooms being noted as cleaned. That was the only thing that she addressed. My husband and I have stayed at numerous hotels over the years. We have never had such a horrible experience and been treated so badly at any of the hotels we've ever stayed in.

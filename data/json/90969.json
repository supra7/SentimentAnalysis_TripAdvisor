Located a short 2.5 blocks from the Union Station, south down Canal St., this motel is sits by itself on the west side, far from hotels in the Loop or along Michigan Avenue to the north. For those arriving by train at Union Station, or by Greyhound two blocks directly west, this place is a real find. No long taxi rides to expensive rooms. Most recent stay was January 31, 2012 for $137.56 (tax included) in an immaculate suite that included bedroom, sitting room and working desk, kitchenette, and a spotless bathroom. Check in was quick and check out was automatic by depositing keys in a front desk box. A spacious lobby, a clean Laundromat and a restaurant complete the picture. One little irritation is that the suite faced both busy Canal St. and the Eisenhower Expressway, the latter of which generates a mild rumble at all times which quickly becomes light background noise. Personnel have always been friendly, efficient and accommodating. Prices rise on weekends and as the season becomes milder, but for one arriving by train or bus, or driving in on the Expressway (take Canal St. exit, next right on Harrison St. and then an immediate right into the motel parking lot), what more can you ask for?

Rooms are good, very much Holiday Inn but clean and what I need. I was upgraded to a suite #437, and it's more space than I live in on a daily basis, and has a microwave, fridge, and a flat-panel TV although I don't watch it. Front desk staff is friendly, although check-in took a little longer than I would like due to several people all at once. Room is surprisingly quiet since it's so close to the freeway. Great looking business center on the top floor, looks more like an internet cafe than the typical hotel business center - very nice. I did not try the pizza joint attached to the hotel, it has looked pretty empty every time I've passed by the window. If the GM or anyone from the hotel reads the reviews on TA - The WiFi is pretty slow, and could use a bandwidth upgrade.

A diner featured on \"Diners, Dives & Drive-Ins\" is a 1/2 mile walk away, an \"Al's Beef\" is a mile away, and the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) is 3/4 mile away. However, most of the attractions like Navy Pier, the aquarium and the Science Museum are over 3 miles away -- a $10 cab ride each way. The Holiday Inn is also 1/2 mile from a Whole Foods store, which came in handy when I refused to pay $7 for a toast-apple-OJ breakfast, or $9 for the same thing with an egg -- I walked to the store, picked up some yummy pumpkin-spice muffins, bottles of orange juice and a bag of pretzels to snack on for the two nights I was there. The hotel is rated 3 stars by Priceline, and I wonder why, because it was pretty standard chain-hotel stuff. Basic room, with no microwave or fridge; tiny bathroom; tv; bed; chair; desk. The lobby was small and non-ornate. Valet parking was $30/day, but the parking lot directly adjacent to the hotel had a big \"$18/night\" sign displayed. My room smelled like stale cigarette smoke, the A/C never actually turned on, and the bottom of the bathroom door was kinda splintered. WiFi is free throughout the hotel, and was basically decent, though I did have a few sporadic connection issues. It was really no better than an average chain hotel room, I don't get the rating, although if I craned my neck, I could see the Sears..er, Willis Tower from my room. I will say that the attached fitness room was well stocked -- not just the usual 2 treadmills and an exercycle of most hotels, but a half-dozen workout machines, including nautilus. Their business center served my needs as well, as I printed out several documents on their laser printer at no extra charge. They have a neat rooftop pool, but it was drained, covered and locked off when I was there. Aurelio's Pizza, the restaurant attached to the hotel, is a mixed bag. The first night I had a pasta dish that was, frankly, bad. I never knew there was such a thing as \"meat powder\" until I ordered their pasta with meat sauce that had no actual pieces of meat in it. However, the pizza I ordered the 2nd night was fabulous -- fresh toppings, real cheese, awesome sauce, and their 10\" \"Super Six\" had to have weighed three pounds. I think the best feature of the hotel really is the staff...they were all great. I arrived at 11:00 am...way before the 3pm check-in time...but they had a room for me. They called countless taxi cabs for me, which usually arrived within 90 seconds of calling them. They held my bag after I checked out, and they were unfailingly friendly.

Within the hotel building is a chain pizza place that featured a bar, a full hot breakfast buffet (not included in room price), a pizza and pasta lunch buffet on week-days, and dinners. A convenience store was five blocks away, and several restaurants were a little beyond that. I noted that onsite, outdoor parking would be $16 per day, and nearby covered parking is $9 per day. However, since a 72 hour pass for unlimited rides on the CTA is only $12 per person, it is clearly best to not use a car when visiting Chicago. Hotel is located just a couple blocks from both the Amtrak Station and the bus station. The neighborhood is sufficiently safe that even a late night arrival would not be a problem -- just be aware of exactly how to get to the hotel, as Chicago's grid system makes all streets look alike. The hotel is also just a block from the \"Clinton\" stop on the CTA Blue Subway Line, meaning you can go from O'Hare Airport direct to the hotel -- and Midway Airport would require one change of train. You can easily either walk or ride the subway to the Loop, and the McCormick Center is a couple miles away.

The customer service at this hotel is top rate. There are always at least two concierge/bellmen ready to provide directions, call a cab (very quickly too!), or carry a bag for you. One of them even gave me a quarter when I was rooting through my purse for change for the newspaper. The desk staff is pleasant and very helpful. They met all of my needs very well. The room was nice. Clean, basic amenities, quiet even though the hotel is located right off interstate 290. Holiday Inn has a pillow menu, and there are three pillows on the bed. Nice quality toiletries in the bath (shampoo, conditioner, body soap, face soap, and lotion) but I do not like the smell of mint - not their fault. Good pressure and hot water in the shower. The penthouse (top floor) contains a workout area, a business center, and a rooftop outdoor pool. The pool was indeed chilly at 8:30 a.m., but in the afternoon the sun warmed it considerably. Neat to swim outside on the roof during the air show - good views. The business center was a computer and a printer - both worked well and quickly. Fast internet. The workout room has several good quality machines (treadmills, stairmasters, ellipticals) and televisions to view while working out. Everyone I met that worked for the hotel greeted me with what came across as sincere pleasure to see me, and made eye contact when saying hello or asking how to help. Onsite pizza restaurant was good enough - the waitstaff there was very friendly and accomodating. Prices were good - pizza was okay, but the breadsticks were quite good. There is also a small chicken and fish place next door - independently owned. Parking is $30 valet, or $16 to self park. Do the self park, the lot is just next door the hotel. It's not necessarily guarded, there are the usual caveats about your stuff, but I overlooked that lot and it was well lit at night. The hotel is a bit off the beaten path, but I walked downtown in 20 minutes, easily. It is near enough by cab to the Museum Campus. Cabs were quickly hailed by the bellmen, and are plentiful everywhere. They are also required to take credit cards in Chicago. You need to be firm with some of them about this, but they are. I will stay here again in November.

For some reason we had a disabled suite, so the shower was always leaking onto the bathroom floor and we had to laydown towels on a regular basis to keep out feet dry. But the room was good. Not a lot of noise going on, so a good nights sleep had each night. No complaints about the room, although this place was a little expensive. There was also a rooftop pool, which was the coldest pool I have ever swam in! Literally freezing.. nice pool area though and if the water was warm would have been fantastic. Nice views from the roof of the surrounding buildings. The main issue was that there was nothing to do really immediately at the hotel. You can walk down St Canal St about 10 minutes and you hit some shops and supermarkets, ideal for some shopping or food. There is a bus stop at Union Station, so you can commute for 2 dollars to the main attractions that Chicago has to offer. I would recommend spending a day at Navy Pier, which is easy to get to by bus.

So, I had the pleasure of watching noisy school groups come and go and found out that our \"suite\" hotel plays host to traffic school!

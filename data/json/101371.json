Would of rated higher if we didn't lose the lanai for a week. Rented our unit through MauiOwners.com not the El Dorodo so we were pretty much stuck with the unit. Great unit though, great view, great location, lots of newer stuff in unit. Some of the units are getting dated, but a number of units including the one I had are investing some money in their investment. All staff were great Jeffrey, Pam, thanks. Pam is great to book tours through and also makes great sandwiches. Cabanna can be tricky to get a chair, they do that caribean thing though, put towels over the chairs to hold them then show up whenever. Went down early one day so I could be there when it opened to put towels over a couple of chairs for me. Got there 20 minutes before there was supposed to be any towels handed out yet. Imagine my surprize to find ten chairs already taken with towels issued from the Cabanna. (something fishy going on here) Great place though would not hesitate to go back, now that I know a few of the tricks the reguliars pull off. Make sure to buy some groceries at costco when in Kahalui, can get expensive to eat out all the time, but it is Maui.

The room was very spacious, clean and modern looking. It had a fully equipped kitchen, seperate lounge room and bedroom as well as washing facilities. We booked a partical ocean view room with a lanai. We didn't really have any views except of a pool and frangipani tree. It is a long walk down to the cabana so I recommend calling reception to take you down their in a golf cart. The only downsides were that the shower and toilet area were a bit small but managable and the view was a little less than expected. Otherwise I highly recommend this hotel.

We were looking for someplace moderately priced for our 7 day stay, and the Eldorado completely blew us away. These are 8 unit/2 story building condos set in the middle of the Kaanapali Golf Course. We booked a Studio Garden View, which is their least expensive room, and were delighted with our accommodations. It looked just like the picture online. It was very spacious, quiet, beautifully decorated, and equipped with a fully loaded kitchen, washer and dryer, and a dining/sitting area. We could just make out the ocean from our lanai, and were steps away from one of their 3 pools. The grounds are meticulously cared for and are filled with gorgeous tropical flowers, trees and bushes. When we first arrived, we had a problem with our lanai door which was stuck and wouldn\u2019t open. The hotel staff was very efficient and took care of it promptly. Even though it is a condo, they have housekeeping services that come in daily to make the bed, replace towels, tidy the bathroom, and replace coffee if requested. The Eldorado was perfect for us. We didn\u2019t want a small cramped expensive hotel room. Here we had all the comforts of home, and had breakfast in our condo. We bought groceries at the Safeway in the Lahaina Cannery Mall. This saved a few bucks plus we didn\u2019t have to get up as early to go out to eat. And it was convenient to be able to do a load of wash during our 11 day Hawaii stay. We are not beach enthusiasts, so having a nice comfortable place to stay in between our tourist excursions was great. But if you do like the beach it is still very doable. The beach and Whalers Village is a ten minute walk from the condo, but they will drive you to the cabana on the beach in one of their golf carts. If you do walk down to the beach during the day, there is a shortcut through the back using the golf paths; just make sure you don\u2019t walk on the golf course itself. This avoids the big hill you need to walk down, and then up on the way back if you go out the front. At night it isn\u2019t advisable, since the golf course is not lighted and the paths are too dark to walk. There is also a trolley that you can catch starting at 10:00AM. I thought Whalers Village was going to be some small strip mall with a few restaurants. It is a beautiful upscale multilevel mini mall with a Sephora and a Rolex store! It also has an ABC store, which are ubiquitous in Hawaii as you will find out. It also has a food court with some small local vendors that serve great less expensive sandwiches and breakfasts, along with a McDonalds and a Subway. It also has three sit down restaurants located right on the beach. We had a few dinners at Leilani\u2019s and highly recommend it. Make sure you save room for a piece of Hula pie. They are one of a few restaurants that serve it in Hawaii, and it is one of the best desserts you will ever eat! As far as location, these Eldorado condos are located in a quiet section of Kaanapali, near the Sheraton, Whaler and Royal Lahaina. We liked this location a lot more than the area to the north, which is more congested, and much better than the Kihei area. Kihei in south Maui feels residential with tons of condos, time shares and strip malls. If you didn\u2019t see the palm trees you\u2019d think you were in some mainland city housing complex. In addition, the parking at the Eldorado is one if the least expensive at $7/day, and they do not charge a resort fee. Be careful with parking in Maui. Honestly, I believe it is a major source of income for the island! If you park in the Whalers Village ramp, make sure you purchase something at one of the stores to get your parking validated, otherwise you\u2019ll be in for a hefty parking fee. Parking is not free in Lahaina either. We parked in the Lahaina Center parking lot on Papalaua St. We purchased inexpensive items at the ABC store there, and they validated our parking. You must purchase items only in the Lahaina Center stores for the parking validation, since other stores in Lahaina do not participate. Then we walked through the shops and restaurants in Lahaina. It\u2019s a great place for some historic walks, food and great shopping. There is a gentleman there who will take pictures of you and your family with his colorful parrots, and don\u2019t miss Ululani\u2019s Shaved Ice. We booked all of our reservations through Maui Kay at www.mauikay.com. She is located right in Maui, and we highly recommend her. She had great inside information about the island and was terrific to work with. We contacted her mostly by e-mail since there is a 5 hour time difference from NY. Also check out Jon Blum\u2019s site at http://www.mauihawaii.org/ . He also lives in Maui and is a great source of inside info about Maui.

Some of the reviews are fantastic, but our unit was not in good condition. It was actually somewhat disgusting. The entire unit needed painted (about 10 years ago) and baseboard work. We had water damage is both bathrooms and the bedroom. The tubs were missing large sections of porcelain and there were tiles missing and cracked everywhere. Counters were mildewed and missing tiles. Kitchen was just kind of old and yucky. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom was right above the bed and so loud and clanky we turned it off to sleep. Our deadolt didn't work, bathroom sink didn't drain and no lightbulb in outside doorway. On the plus side, the area was fantastic. We had a beautiful, large balcony with a view of the golf course and the ocean. It was amazing to sit out and view the scenery. We loved the cabana and beach area. The pool area was big, but very cold. Overall, we would not stay here again, unless we got one of the great units that other people seem to review favorably. So beware what you may end up with.

It was wonderful! My husband & I shared a 2BR/2BA condo with my Mom & Dad. We had unit B100. At first we were disappointed to be near the road & far away from the beach. But our disappointment turned to joy when we saw the inside of the unit. You know how the brochure or online pictures are normally the most beautiful unit & noone actually gets a room that looks like the picture? Well we got it! It was perfectly appointed, clean & modern. The walk from our unit to the beach cabana took less then 10 minutes in flip flops. We did take the golf cart back about half the time & while not required we tipped the driver a couple of bucks for the service. We only swam in one of the 3 pools. The large one on top of the parking garage. The middle pool was a little small & cold and we just never made it to the 3rd one which was actually the closest to us. Pool towels prvided in your room, beach towels at the cabana. The cabana deck was awesome! Loved having a fridge to put our beverages in. The cabana also checks out beach chairs in case the deck is full or the sun isn't on the deck yet. Sun started hitting the deck about 11am. Minor issues that could have been better; need more hangers in the closet, no fan in the bathroom to remove steamy air, tile floor needed mopping & the carpet might need shampooing because our feet or socks got dirty if we weren't wearing shoes inside. Small parking areas near the units fill up fast so you can expect to park in the garage & walk to your unit. Loved eating at Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina. A short 10 min drive South & liked the Times Supermarket about 5 min North better than the Safeway in Lahaina.

Everything worked great. We overlooked one of the pools and had an ocean view. Our condo was close to the road that runs in front of the Outrigger, and was inititally worried about road noise, but once inside the condo, we never noticed it. We used the cabana that is down by the beach. They offered towels and chairs for the beach, which we took advantage of. We usually walked down there, but you can take the carts back and forth as well. We got help at the activity desk with recommendations for eating, snorkling and trips. They were very helpful. I really liked the location as well. Close to everything, but not right in the middle of more crowded areas. There's a small strip mall close by with a great coffee shop too.

The rate was good ($155/night for a Studio with partial ocean view, but this was slightly discounted as it was with a wedding group), and we were upgraded to a 1-bedroom which was HUGE... I think it was bigger than the last place we lived! It had two full bathrooms, a well-equipped full kitchen, separate living room, master bedroom, and GIGANTIC deck with dining table and lounge chairs. It was immaculately clean, and service was friendly. All units have W/D which is really nice. Parking is $7/day and wi-fi is included. The beach access isn't bad, with a 5 minute walk down to the beach (or a quick call will give you a golf cart ride to the cabana), but it's not as easy as just walking out your door and onto the beach. I know a lot of it depends on which room you stay in as they are individually owned, but the property seems to lack the Hawaiian charm we've found elsewhere. You can walk down to Black Rock for snorkeling, but we found significantly better snorkeling in South Maui (Kihei/Wailea/Makena areas). We also liked the beaches better in South Maui. I think that the Maui Eldorado would be an excellent choice for families who want the amenities of a kitchen, washer/dryer, more space, and to take the kids to the beach for the day. As a younger married couple, we were a little bored here and didn't like the $20 cab ride to Lahaina for some nightlife.

The location of Eldorado makes it the winner. A clean (firm) bed and shower area is what you're looking for in these places. This one had some mildew on the shower head, so do the Villas, but I can over look that and did mention it to the staff and my followup survey. Both beds were clean and firm here. Black Rock is the best snorkel location, and this hotel is right there. Don't worry about the views. Garden view is fine, and your view will be of a golf course no matter what you pick, even if it's a garden view. Some units do see the ocean, but you're gong to see that in person any way.

The lanai wrapped most of the way around the corner of the building and had a dining table on it and some lounge chairs!

I read lots of reviews and was concerned about the state of the condos but we couldn't be more pleased! Our room appeared to be very clean and nicely painted. The internet connection worked great! The only things I would say is it looks like there's a stain on the rug in the living room, and the master bedroom air conditioning had a little trouble keeping the room quite as cool as I wanted it. Also, the blinds in the master let in a little more early morning light than I would have liked but the room darkening curtains in the 2nd bedroom were wonderul! I think one of the things people whe review this place forget is that it is a condo, not a hotel. We have stayed in condos several places and things are never perfect with the accomodations. Individuals decorate them and each one is different. People talk about the lack of maid service but again, this is a condo. Most of the places we've stayed don't offer maid service during your stay at all, especially not included in the very reasonable price that this condo costs. Someone came in and made the bed daily, cleaned out the trash and brought us new coffee. This pleased my husband very much! They even left little condiments jars!

We first stayed at the Maui Eldorado three years ago based on the recommendations of others and were very pleased at the end of our 10 day stay. We recently stayed in your facility from May 18-May 31, 2011 only to have the end result be disappointment. It started with the end of our first night wondering how our feet had gotten so dirty\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly to discover that the carpet in the unit was completely filthy. As our stay continued we learned that vacuuming only takes place every other day which seems unsanitary when you are in an environment of sand and water on a daily basis. Also bathtubs and toilets apparently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get cleaned on a regular basis either. The microwave turntable in our unit (k106) was broken so food did not cook right and the DVD player only worked when it wanted to. Finally about 3 days before we were ready to leave I decided to read some of the reviews on-line to see if it was just me or if things had gone downhill as bad as I felt they had. I read some of the GM's responses and was surprised to hear him say if only guests would have let the staff know they could have received better cleaning services or a different room. It seems to me there would be a standard set for the cleaning services that the property would want all of their guests to receive and a standard minimum condition for all the rooms. We also had a situation where we were told that our air conditioner would need to be serviced from 10-noon the next day and we needed to be out of our room, so we were. We returned to receive a message that the service people did not show up and we would need to be gone the next day from 10-noon, so we did. When we returned at 1:00 to have lunch in our room we were interrupted because the service people came at that time instead\u00ef\ufffd\u0152 When we checked out I did speak with the staff about some of the concerns only to be told the cleaning services have changed and now only include changing the sheets once in a while and taking out the garbage and bringing in clean towels. This is not at all what your guests are aware of when they purchase your services. One last thing, we had a surprise concert sprang on us without any courtesy of notice. In one of the reviews in April when a guest complained the GM said he would talk with the manager so that it would not happen in the future. It must have slipped his mind. I think all guests are asking for is just a courtesy notice that it will be taking place.

The shower area is seriously outdated and is in need of some remodeling. Housekeeping did a good job of keeping towels and bath supplies stocked, however, they came pretty early in the morning. The only thing going for the Maui Eldorado is the location and the beach, which is why we stayed there in the first place. The activity desk was not very helpful in trying to schedule island activities. We did not complain about the problems with our unit until check out, as I told the front desk that everything should have been addressed before we checked in and I did not want to deal with repair people while I was on vacation. That tells me about how the Maui Eldorado views there customers. The beach cabana is an excellent place to relax and enjoy. The beach area is awesome, lots of sand and no rocks. I like this area on Maui but will be looking for other possible accommodations. If you are looking for a fantastic beach without luxury accommodations then this is for you.

First, the positive. The location is fabulous! The resort is in close proximity to Lahaina Town and Whaler's Village, and is on a beautiful stretch of Kaanapalli Beach. Another plus is the Beach Cabana that has lounge chairs, towels, showers, bathrooms and a full kitchen for all your needs. The grounds of the resort are well kept and very beautiful. Front desk staff, concierge, and the staff in the lobby store were all very friendly and helpful. Now, the negative. Prior to choosing this resort, we did extensive research into the facility, including reading all Trip Advisor reviews. The one thing that other travelers kept repeating was to make sure to request a remodeled/updated room, as the condos are all privately owned. Despite making this request at the time of booking (three months in advance), sending an email to the facility a few weeks prior (I did not receive a response), and again requesting an updated/remodeled room at check-in, we were given an extremely outdated unit (J-102). I understand that Outrigger is just the management company for these condo units, however, I do believe a certain amount of quality control should be implemented. The furniture in our unit was chipped and peeling, the couch had a permanent dampness to it, the carpets were stained and dingy, the walls had scuffs and marks on them, the entertainment center was scuffed and marked, the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable, the curtains were dirty and ripped, there was a hole in one of the bathroom doors, the bathroom mirrors were pitted and tarnished, the kitchen counters had dings and marks, and the main patio doors in the living room didn't quite shut all of the way. Having said all of that, the unit was extremely spacious and open with an amazing view of the golf course and the ocean beyond it. All the unit needs is a little money and some TLC.

Do not expect a mega resort though!\u201d", "Author": "pcsanity", "ReviewID": "UR82898844", "Content": "We stayed at the Maui El Dorado for three nights of our nine night Hawaii trip. This condo complex was in a great location and an excellent value. The remainder of our stay was at the Grand Wailea so we were not looking for an ultra luxury location while on Kaanapali. This was our first time to stay at a condo complex and were happy with our decision. The location was easily found by our GPS located in the heart of the Kaanapali Resort area, right near the beach. (There is a section of the golf course between the hotel and beach / cabana) The condo is adjacent to Black Rock and the Sheraton. Self parking is $7, which some people were not happy with but I was pleased that the complex does not have a resort fee, which seems to run rampant in Hawaii. We arrived very late due to flight delays and were greeted by the night security guard Randy was very welcoming and took us to our condo and even assisted with our heavy luggage. (Dive gear). There is a central parking garage that always had plenty of space. The condo we were in for the first night was well appointed but unfortunately the curtains were sheer and did not block out any light. (they should consider making this a standard requirement of all the units) If we wanted to rise early every day it would not have been a problem, but since we were on vacation we wanted to be able to sleep in a bit. We went down to the front desk and she kindly gave us the option of a few more units to check out. We selected J120 which was a direct view of the ocean over the golf course. Very well appointed and comfortable. They even took care of transferring out luggage while we were out. Check in was quick and easy and our luggage arrived in our room promptly. The front desk person even gave us a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. I think that this was great customer service. The units are not ultra plush, maybe a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The complex has at least two pools, nothing spectacular, but nice enough for a quick lounge when you do not want to head to the beach. The beach and private cabana as well as Black Rock (great snorkeling) are about a 7 minute walk from the complex and is a really nice perk. I think that the beach is nicer than that of the Sheraton. The cabana has a nice deck with loungers, towels, seat backs for the beach. Though there are not umbrellas available at the beach, there are many nice trees along the dune line if you are looking for shade. The cabana also has a full stove, refrigerator, and sink area. This is a great touch that allows you to bring your drinks, snacks, lunch, whatever while hanging out at the beach. (The cabana was being remodeled and should be complete by now) Though this condo complex lacks the Disney-esque pools of some of the mega resort hotels, we would come back here in a heart beat. It was very centrally located in the Kaanapali area. You could walk to the shops at Whalers village in about a 12 minute casual stroll and easy to find. (Though if you come back at night it can be hard to find the walkways across the golf course......make sure to pay attention when heading out for the night.) The complex has a small lobby with an activity booking agent and a convenience store. There is a nice casual service restaurant in a shopping center right across the street. The rooms had nicely appointed full kitchens, acceptable bathrooms, washer, dryer, King or Queen bed, Couch, dining table, and balcony with chairs. It seems most of the units had 27\" CRT TV's....I am sure owners will gradually upgrade the TV's. The units have free internet, though it is hard wired and not wifi. (If we were staying for a full week we might consider bringing a cheap wireless router) Housekeeping provided refresh service each day and was very prompt to come to our unit the day that we called for service when we had not yet seen them. All of the staff we ran across during out stay was friendly and willing to help when asked for assistance. We stayed at the Sheraton next door last year and for about twice the price I think we would just come back to the El Dorado....we would rather spend the money on activities and found that the location of the El Dorado is excellent. Though the grounds at the Sheraton were more stellar we felt that the rooms at the El Dorado were just as nicely appointed and it was nice to have the kitchen and laundry facilities.

Hopefully the hotel management reads this. The night security guard Randy is absolutely FANTASTIC! Because we arrived late he let us into our room. Very friendly and welcoming. After we settled in we went out to look at the stars (we are city people and don't see them that often) and Randy happened to be doing his rounds and drove by on his golf cart. We were chatting with him about the stars and the island when he told us that later that night (around 1am) there was supposed to be a meteor shower. He suggested we go out to the golf course for a better view. He then changed his mind, told us to hop on and drove us down to the beach cabana for an even better view. He showed us where to not walk so as not to trigger the sensor lights and ruin our view. So there we sat on our first night (or morning) laying on the beach chairs on the cabana watching shooting stars (about one a min or so) with the waves in the background as our soundtrack! AMAZING night we will never forget and all thanks to Randy!!! Also, as we are night owls we came across Randy throughout our stay and actually looking forward to seeing him. If we had our lanai door open and he was driving by he'd stop and say \"hey night owls! have fun today?\" and he would stop for a quick chat. Such a sweet man!!!! Ok onto the hotel. The bad: Pay parking (booooo). Also if you stay on the bottom floor and someone is in the room above you when they are just moving around it sounds like they are dropping bowling balls. Luckily the room above us was only occupied 2 nights. The good: CLEAN rooms. Good beds. The whole hotel and grounds are immaculate.

Almost two walls of windows means little sound proofing. We were glad to leave right after that change. If you're staying in Maui between June and September and prefer quiet (like me), I would not stay at the Eldorado. Lahaina is a nice town to stay in if you don't plan on going upcountry or south very often. Best shave ice (Ululani's), good restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls and great bays for snorkeling are within 10-15 minutes (driving). If we return to Maui though, we'd stay more centrally located though, like Makena or Kihei, as the drive back to the middle of Maui from Lahaina became taxing.

The housekeeper we had was really nice and left us alone as we requested. We just wanted fresh towels and were provided them when we asked, Service: This is hard. At the end of our stay we forgot some medication in a cup in a cabinet...we had already checked out. After practically begging the desk attendent to check for it she called the manager on duty who did go and get the cup and brought it out to us. That was very nice of him, and the contents were VERY important to my partner. When we signed in I wish that the staff would have given us a run-down on different transportation options and the schedule for those, where to go and such. We eventually figured it out since we saw the green trolley go by on several of our walks. If you stay here, get the schedule from the front desk and use this mode. It's free (just tip the driver) and it's really fun. If you miss the pickup time, you may find it better to begin the walk. I somehow misunderstood and thought the ElDorado provided transport to Whalers Village, but apparently they do not. They do however go to the beach below the golf course. My partner was able to get a ride from ElDorado to the Whalers on one occasion, but the next time we asked they dropped us off at the top of the hill which was just silly. If you do walk, it's not THAT bad. Just walk down the hill along the street.

We recently lost Mom, and Dad wanted to go back one more time to where he had such good memories. In a previous Trip Advisor review, I recalled there was a room behind the reception desk that Regina had been placed in. When we opened the door to the unit, I immediately knew it was the same tired room that was in great need of renovation. Not only was I frustrated at the resort for placing us there, I was also angry for using Expedia.com. Something I learned about Expedia and most likely all the other travel.com sites is that they often end up booking unsuspecting vacationers in the worst rooms at the facility. When hotels and resorts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to book them, they offer them to the travel.com sites. When Expedia originally booked us in a king room, I called the Eldorado to tell them I had requested a room with two beds. After connecting me with the person who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153handles discount bookings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I knew this was not going to be easy. They said I would have to contact Expedia again to make the change. After talking to numerous customer reps., I demanded to speak with a supervisor. Very frustrating but they finally were able to switch us to a two bed unit, of course at an additional cost. The morning after we arrived, I went to the front desk and spoke with Maryann Valois. I explained that I had read about this room and told her how much I wanted everything to just go right for the three nights we were to be on Maui as this was Dad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last trip. She fully understood my frustration. She asked us to return at noon and that she would have our bags moved to another room. We arrived back to room103 in building F. What a wonderful surprise to find such a nice, spacious and colorfully renovated unit. Maryann had come through for us and many thanks to her for the extra effort to make our trip a memorable experience. To top it off, when we returned to the room for our last evening, Maryann had placed a large going away package on the kitchen counter for us. It really left a great lasting impression on both Dad and I. When I return with my family, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asking for Maryann. Also, managing a high-rise condominium in the city, I frequently find myself describing to residents the terrific accommodations and how Maryann saved our trip. Already have people asking for my brochures. Side note: Next trip, we will stay on Maui the entire trip rather then stay some on Maui and some on Oahu. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re older, Maui is much more of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for when you visit Hawaii. Now, if they would just play more Hawaiian music. I would also like to thank Trip Advisor and the throngs of visitors who take the time to review and make honest comments about their experiences. So much great information was available.

We have never stayed in any of the Outrigger \"condo-hotels\" but the overall experience was not bad. As timeshare owners, we are use to this type of accomodations. So let me give you my/our overall impression... Location is very good. You are not on the beach, but if you are fortunate enough to get a unit along the golf course, then I think you have a bonus view. Some of these also will have a partial ocean view. We stayed in the J building, unit 105. We had a great view of the golf course which both my wife and I enjoyed. Each morning we would cook our breakfast (kitchen description to follow), have some good hawaiian coffee, and watch the golfers. All we had to do to look for the ocean was take about 5 steps out of our unit and there was a partial view. The units here are individually owned. Outrigger is the property manager. So there is not a lot of uniformity between the units. Some are more updated than others. Our unit was a 1 bedroom unit but it had 2 double beds in it. There is also a pull out sleeper sofa, that we did not use. The kitchen was fairly well stocked. Pots, pans, toaster,a rice cooker (which we used almost every day), and of course a stove, cooktop, microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher. There were plenty of glasses, plates.... Just like being home! The furnishings in our unit were adequate. The TV's were not large or very modern. There was a DVD unit if you wanted to watch movies. A decent cable TV selection but not the premium movie stations. The sofa in the living room was... OK... but not great. Since it was a sleeper sofa, I think it can't be real comfortable. The bathroom was pretty spacious. Your regular run of the mill shower/tub, and a toilet in one part of the bathroom and outside of that was a double sink. Plenty of closet space and one of the best perks... a small washer and dryer! They gave us 2 loads of laundry soap which we used. Knowing we had this let us pack very little (no checked baggage) and hence we didn't have to wait at baggage claim to start or finish our vacation! The staff was pretty good. We did have one problem with our TV's and it wasn't until the 2nd request that anything got done, but they did take care of it all in one day. The units also have cable internet access. There is a modem and ethernet cord for those who bring a computer. No WIFI in the units but there is WIFI in the lobby. The pools are a bit disappointing. There are 3 of them situated around the complex. No hot tubs!! That was extremely disappointing. There are also a few bar-b-que grills around the complex. Wish they had more and had them spread around. They do provide both bath and pool/beach towels in the room. But we like to go to Hawaii for the ocean! The bonus to this property is the beach cabana that is a short walk or golf cart ride away. The cabana has lounge chairs, tables and chair under a roof, and they will provide chair backs for the sand (along with towels). The cabana also has a refrigerator and a microwave so you can pack up lunch, pupu's (appetizers), or what ever you want. There were severeral of us who would put a 6 pack of beer to enjoy. Then you can get up, get something to eat or drink, and go back to swimming, sunning, or whatever you were doing. There is also an outdoor shower and bathrooms there. The one thing I wish they would add.... how about some boogie boards or toys for kids to use. We happened to be given a boogie board by people who were leaving and then we did the same when we left. I'm sure the Outrigger can stock their cabana with items left by visitors. Then they could make them available to those who want them. We were quite happy staying here. They do charge $7 a day to park. That is another charge that I don't understand. The garage is not monitered by an attendant, nor is there any gate. The hotel is situated so that not many outsiders would park here (except maybe during the golf tournaments). So why not eliminate that charge! We did like our unit and I would recommend trying to get a golf course facing unit. Building J and several others face the golf course... ask for one of those units if you can. Lastly... why is this hotel listed under Lahaina? The hotel is in Kaanapali. One of the greatest beaches in the world!! Lahaina is just a 5-10 minute drive away. You can walk to Whaler's Village from here or there are some shops along the highway just prior to turning into the El Dorado. Have a nice stay here.

I appreciated that she heard us and did her best to accomodate our request. The rooms are given A ratings or B ratings depending on how the owner had refurbished it.

As has been pointed out before, there is variability among the units, so some may be better or worse than ours. We reserved a studio via Orbitz which was a good size, approx. 700 sf. Room was clean, furniture and appliances were in decent shape (not new, but not old either). Dishes and utensils were provided and were decent. As for the location, I find the \"15 minute walk to the beach\" claims to be a bit exaggerated. It's more like a 5-minute walk to the beach. It's not any different than walks to the beach from your room at one of the mega-resort type hotels (the ones with lots of buildings, long hallways, waits for elevators, and strategic paths meandering past shops and concessions). The golf course is between the rooms and the ocean, so the walk is not in a straight line, which may make it feel longer, but it is literally 5 minutes max. The beach was nice and pretty open. Great for sitting or laying out, though there is much better snorkeling next door at the Sheraton (which is signed as a public beach). Nobody said anything to us when we brought our Outrigger towels through the Sheraton grounds to the beach to snorkel. It's probably about a 10-minute walk from your Eldorado room to the Sheraton beach. What was annoying was that the Eldorado has a number of nickel-and-dime fees. Fees for making toll-free calls, fees for in-room coffee (first one per stay is free, additional is extra), charges for laundry detergent (again, first bottle per stay is free, additional is extra). There was even a charge to use the safe, and if you declined it, they asked you to sign a release form at checkin. This doesn't exactly give the visitor a warm-and-fuzzy on arrival. If it were up to me, I'd rather they comp the coffee and safe, and charge for detergent. That would bring them in line with normal hotel standards. The Internet was free, though, which was nice (and fast). It is with a cable, though, not wifi.

Last year we got a deal at the Sheraton, but there were no deals this year so we booked the Eldorado. We were familiar with the property because we jogged past it many times the previous year and always thought it appeared to be very attractive and well-maintained. The people at the desk, especially the concierge, were very courteous and always helpful. We were in room K211, which is listed as a partial ocean view, but this unit really has a full ocean view. We watched whales every morning and every evening on our huge lanai. Although our room had very dated decor, it was spacious and the washer/dryer came in very handy. Our room was very quiet. We slept great. The beach cabana with towel and beach chair service were very nice. They also have ice water. We snorkeled almost every day either on the Eldorado side or the Sheraton side of Black Rock, depending on which side had calmer clearer water. We swam with sea turtles more than once. We also took the Teralani whale watching tour, which leaves from Kaanapali beach. The Eldorado concierge booked it for us. Fabulous! I recommend happy hour at the Sheraton (3-4pm) Black Rock bar and also the torch lighting ceremony at the Sheraton at around 6:30pm which ends with the torch lighter swan diving off of Black Rock. Whalers Village has many nice shops and is an easy walk from the Eldorado. We only sat by the pool once. It is extremely warm and comfortable, but the surroundings are not that appealing (the big pool). The Sheraton has yoga and pilates at 8:30 am most mornings. $10 (must have cash-you are paying the instructor) and you do not have to be staying at the hotel. We did very little cooking in our nicely equipped kitchen. We ate many times at CJ's deli (mostly carry out-we either ate on our lanai or in our room-our room had a dvd player so we watched some of our own movies). We ate at the Hula Grill on my husband's birthday and they gave us free cak-the music, atmosphere and food are all good. The coffee shop at the Fairway Shops had good sandwiches.

Swimming pools are quiet and uncrowded, unlike the resorts directly on Kanapali beach, yet restaurants, shops, and bars are nearby for our young singles. We recommend CJ's Comfort Zone cafe across the street in the Fairway Shops for excellent everyday food at reasonable prices and David Paul's restaurant in Lahaina for a romantic dinner.

We rented an upstairs Garden view one bedroom through Pleasant Holidays, and were given 205B at check in. We were very happy with our condo as it had a nice view of the gardens, one of the smaller pools, and was in excellent condition (somewhat recently renovated). The condo also had a nice selection of kitchen utensils and even some beach chairs (which came in handy for our island exploring). One note about the Eldorado. They do have an Expedia agent on site. The nearby Royal Lahaina has a Pleasant Holidays desk as well. These come in handy for those that want to book something without getting hassled about a time share of some sort. Even though we booked our vacation through AAA (who used Pleasant Holidays) we did book one excursion through the local Expedia desk and they were more than helpful. Bill, the guy at the desk, dug around until he found a horseback outfit that would take someone as young as our daughter (see below). Some reviews mentioned the maid service was uneven, but we only experienced that one occasion. Otherwise, they were always done between 10 AM and Noon. We utilized the Eldorado beach cabana on a couple of days, but actually preferred the DT Fleming Beach Park up the road in Kapalua. There were less rocks in the water near the shore. I would suggest hitting the beach in the morning though. The wind kicks up some serious sand by afternoon across West Maui. Other suggestions/things we enjoyed: 1. The luau at the Hyatt (Drums of the Pacific). Very professional, but get in line by 415 PM to get a seat close to the stage. 2. Hula Grill (great place for food and sunset views) 3. Horseback Riding at Mendes Ranch. They are true professionals and took good care of us (even with our inexperienced 7 year old daughter) 4. We also did the dolphin excursion through the Pacific Whale Foundation. Great, affordable tour which allowed for great video. 5. The Ulelana show in Lahaina was also quite enjoyable. 6. If you are adventurous and patient, you can ignore the rental car warning and take the loop north of Kapalua all the way around West Maui. The views are unbelievable. 7. If you are into photography and flowers, the Kula Botanical Garden is worth a stop. Not so great: 1. We did save money by cooking in the condo, but you will be in for some serious \"sticker shock\" if you go to the Safeway in Lahaina or Star Market in Honokaiwa.

We've stayed here twice in the last two years. Our last stay was in OCT of '07, I've just been too lazy to write reviews. We've stayed in a 1 bed + loft, and a HUGE 2 bedroom (1700 sq ft). I'll write this review with a summary of both stays and try not to differentiate between the two. First, if you're looking to come to the island and swim in a gigantic beautiful pool, and be waited on while sipping $8 drinks, stop reading now, and move on. The Outrigger Eldorado is about location and value for my family. This is the best of both worlds. Like every other review states, it is walking distance to Whalers village and all of what Kaanapali beach has to offer. It is located directly behind the Maui Sheraton and wonderful Black Rock (which has some GREAT snorkeling, and torch lighting at sunset courtesy of the Sheraton). Most condos have a good view of the golf course and some units have a view of the ocean (although I wouldn't expect it). CONDO: +Big spacious, CLEAN, well maintained condos +Housekeeping is very good at this Outrigger (we've stayed at others that weren't nearly as good) they are happy to leave extra laundry detergent, towels ect. Just leave a quick note and a small token of your appreciation. +Kitchens are FULLY stocked (cookware, etc) with everything you will need for cooking +Large Lanai's +BBQ's are clean, and in good working order +Cabana's on their quiet beach which have refigerators, tables, shade, lounge chairs, etc. +Towel/chair checkout service at the cabana -Parking, not the best, and an extra charge. -Pool areas are bland, especially the large pool (but really who cares, the beach is so close) -Not enough BBQ's Lahina is close, and offers a little more \"affordable\" shopping and dining along with a plethora of touristy stuff to do. If you want the resort experience and have the money for eating out every meal then stay at a resort. If you want to come to Maui and have a great vacation with the convinence of cooking some meals at home and stocking up your fridge with ice cold beer and not having to pay $6 a beer, then stay here.

I made the reservations and did A LOT of research, but I was still nervous. My husband's best friend stays at some of the nicest hotels but we (my husband and I) were travelling on a budget. We arrived at the hotel around midnight to find the front desk closed, but there was a phone for after hours check-in. I was getting really nervous. Someone showed up with in a few minutes and advised us where our building and room was (which happened to be D208, right across the way). He gave us a key card and we went to check it out.... WHAT A RELIEF ! I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was clean and neat and VERY spacious. Because it was nighttime and I couldn't see the view, I was a little worried that I had paid for a partial ocean front view, but didn't get it. AGAIN, to my surprise we had a beautiful ocean view! We were on the second floor and had large lanais with chairs and tables. It was great. The larger bedroom was very big and the other bedroom was still a good size. I was very impressed with the location, size and cleanliness. We had maid service everyday. They were very friendly. The condos do not have their own jacuzzis, but they do have 3 pools, the 2 that I saw were nice, but we never actually used them... We were in a GREAT location with great beaches, so we never had the time! We never missed the lack of room service (which is usually overpriced). We had a good sized kitchen with plenty of utensils and cookware. It was perfect. I will say this though, our building was located the closest to Highway 30 off Kekaa Dr. and I am telling you, come 6am (Hawaii time) you could really HEAR the traffic from the smaller bedroom. Unfortunately the smaller bedroom has a small louvered window which allowed A LOT of noise in during the early morning hours. But we stuffed a couple of pillows up there and made do since everything else was so great... and since we are from California it felt more like 8am or 9am our time.

Go to Black Rock by walking through the Sheraton. It is a lot of fun with great snorkeling! Some hints on restaurants... ALOHA mixed plate (lunch) on Front St. behind the Longs Drugs is amazing!!! Cheeseburgers in Paradise was a lot of fun, a great location and the Coconut Shrimp was great (better than the burgers!).

We informed the hotel upon making our reservations that we were spending our honeymoon in Maui. Yet, the hotel placed us in Room E206. This studio condominium was located directly adjacent and below other condominiums that were being completely renovated. After returning to our room after a day at the beach, we were shocked to see construction workers in the adjacent condo tearing up tiles by hammering and removing a pillar to lanai with a jackhammer. When we entered our studio condo, we could see that we were breathing in dust from the drywall work and tile/concrete removal. Being placed in this condominium is unacceptable by any standards, and we were insulted that the hotel would do such a thing. We were moved to a quieter condo after complaining to the manager. This was pretty inconvenient in that we had to repack all of our belongings and uproot ourselves from our condo at a time that we should have been preparing to go out to dinner. This hotel was under widespread renovations throughout our stay and you could not escape the noise and sight of construction. This was not disclosed to us either prior to or after checking in., and the staff decided to let us find out on our own about the constant disturbances here. We would not recommend that anyone stay here based on the staff and the bad decisions they have made in the past. Parking is a little tight especially if you return to the hotel after 8-9 p.m. It costs $5 a day. The condos themselves can be a litle scuzzy, for example, mold on the shower curtains, grease stains on pots and pans. You definitely get the feeling that you are borrowing a friend's townhouse for the weekend when you stay here. It is comfortable, but the condos still have that lived in feeling. One bright spot about this hotel is that it is well priced for its location, directly across a small fairway from the Sheraton, right off of Kaanapali Pkwy. and a 7-10 minute walk to Whaler's Village. The walk up/down the hill to Kaanapali Pkwy. is infested with insects (i.e. giant red cockroaches) who are crossing the sidewalk to get to the golf course that is watered at night. If you don't like bugs, stay away from this hill and take your car down.

It is a little short walk (about 10 minutes) to the beach or main shopping/dining areas. The walk is also hilly so be prepared. For me (a fitness buff) I enjoyed the walk but if you have any issues with climbing a small hill, you should know this. They do charge you $5 a day to park but that is cheap compared to most the hotels in Lahaina.

While it's not as nice as the other hotels/condos on the southern side of Black Rock (Sheraton side), it's close enough to walk to the beach and you save a bundle from not being right in front of the ocean. The beach in front of the condo is also not as nice as S of Black Rock. It seems the sand is not as clean, but it's good enough if you don't want to walk to the southside. If you snorkel, you can probably snorkel from one side to the other. I snorkel from the Sheraton side over to the El Dorado side and saw a couple of turtles closer to the El Dorado's side. There is also a free trolley that will take you to all the other hotels and Whaler Village on Kannapalli if you don't want to walk, but walking might be faster since the trolley has too many stops. Our condo is large. I think we have about 1600 sq ft of space. The views of the golf course and the ocean were nice. The furnishing is more than adequate but the sofa feels a little dirty/dated, it might be the color. The pillows are quite uncomfortable. The pillows are thick bouncy foam. My wife got a neck pain and had to use folded towels for pillow. We asked for smaller/softer pillows but they didn't have any. The pillows are definitely too big for children. The hot water in the shower is inadequate. We keep getting cold water during the shower in both bath rooms and had to switch back and forth between the shower head and the faucet. This is the biggest draw back since it was difficult to shower the children w/o a handheld shower, let alone a shower that keep turning cold. We washed our cloth everyday so we didn't have to bring alot and it's nice to come home w/o dirty laundry. The staff are alright. Some were outstanding, others just do their job. We didn't have any problem with the staff. The beach cabana doesn't provide any sand toys like someone mentioned elsewhere on this site.

The condo was furnished beautifully and was very, very clean upon check in. The Maui Eldorado is near one of the best beaches in Maui which is only a very short 5 min walk away. The beach cabana is a great service with a full kitchen available for use, showers, and towels.

Anyway, we are absolutely delighted with the Eldorado, our unit has a Kitchen Living/Bedroom with a partial Ocean view. We have a Fridge/Freezer, Washer/Dryer...everything we need for a week's stay. We didn't want a Hotel because we are here partially for a Cycling Vacation, we rented Cannondale R5000 Road Bikes from West Maui Cycles, around 5 minutes away. So there's a tip for you Cyclists out there. There's underground Parking @ $5 per night, half what we paid at the first place, and the nicest part is we can leave the Top off our Jeep rental overnight without fear of waking up in the morning and finding it full of Water!! The Eldorado is conveniently located, turn right for Whaler's Village, left (on the 30) for a spectacular drive around the island...fantastic!! The WiFi (free of charge) is very strong where we are, right next to the Pool. Come to the Eldorado with confidence, you'll love it, plus, most restaurants are very spendy, so stop by at Costco, which is close to the Airport, and stock up for the week.

It was updated, clean, bright, and contained two queen beds, a sofa bed, large bathroom with a very large shower, and a nice kitchen containing all the things we needed. We were very pleasantly surprised. After our own experience and reviewing comments on this site, it seems that Maui Eldorado has a mixed bag to offer. The parking is $5 per day and there was a small charge if you wanted to use the safe. There were still issues with having enough parking, but they assured us if we couldn't find a spot, we could just call security and they would help us.

In a previous post I agree with the person who said the bathrooms were dark and old. We stayed in G building. On the 3rd night there I heard rumbling in our kitchen. Somebody had eaten thru a plastic bag of food. Well when we mentioned that there was a 3rd party in our room and by the bite marks it was very large they said they couldn't move us for a day and not even a sense of \"we are sorry.\" When they did get us a new room they wouldn't even help us move to K building which wasn't close. I even got some snide comments from the staff \"Oh you are the one with the rodent\" and then a chuckle. The manager admitted to me that they knew of a problem in Building G that is why they had an exterminator there the day I found our roommate.

The letter presented the arrangement as \"upgraded\", even though according to trip advisor both average price and review of Royal Kahana is lower than those of Maui Eldorado. During the time we were in Maui, Kahana had frequent rain and drizzle while Kanaapali about ten minutes' drive away is clear, has dry road, not to mention has abundant options on activities and shopping. Subsequent discussion with Maui Eldorado did not lead to anywhere close to getting us out of the tired-looking high rise and into some place sunnier and more conveniently located like Maui Eldorado.

If you NEED to be right on the beach, or NEED to have a swimming pool with mulitple levels and swim-up bars, or if you NEED to have an on-site $20 per lunch restaurant - then this isn't for you. If you're looking for well-kept functional rooms with lots of space, one of the best beach locations on all of Maui, friendly staff everywhere, room extras just for the asking, a convenient location to everything on Maui, and quiet-respite accomodations - THEN THE ELDORADO IS FOR YOU! We stayed in unit D107 - a 1 bedroom that felt and worked much bigger. It came with 2 queen-sized beds in a suite bedroom complete with a full bathroom with dressing room and loads of storage (more room than we have at home!). In the \"living room\" were two single beds posing as modular couch units - just perfect for our two teens. Both of these spaces had walkout lanais with outdoor furniture and sunshades. There was even a TV in both room areas to boot. The kitchen was nicely supplied with lots of dishes, pots & pans, microwave, coffeemaker, drink mixer, toaster, blender, ect... Everything you want for 'making your own eats' for sure. The ice maker in the freezer was great and the fridge was relatively new and worked great. The dishwasher worked great too for easy cleanup of any dirty dishes. We even enjoyed watching and 'chasing' the couple gekkos that we found checking us out from the ceiling- they're harmless and just another feature of Hawaii! No problems with cleanliness or lack of towels or such...the housekeeping was great and can be 'scheduled' just for asking. We would stop at the front lobby on our way for the day and let 'em know when we expected to be back and the room was always 'prepped' for us on our return. Super Service! We bought groceries at the Safeway in Lahaina (a 4 minute drive) - signup for their free 'Members Card' and save lots too! Use it just for the trip as we did and throw it when done if you don't have a Safeway back home. We bought lots of breakfast and dinner foods (although fresh fruits can be purchased cheaper than the grocery at any of the roadside stands around town) and we enjoyed saving dinner dollars by eating in. Our budgeting meant we were able to take in more activities for the same dollars as paying for expensive restaurant meals. We enjoyed fresh Maui fish with all the extras one night for 1/3 the cost of the same meal at any of the hotel restaurants. For quick and very reasonable meals, you can't beat CJ's Comfort Zone located about 100 yards from the main entrance to the Eldo - right in the little strip mall facing the highway. Great home-cooked food, super prices (especially for Maui), and a nifty atmosphere. Ask around for some of their coupons for 50% off the price on a second meal ordered (we found ours at the Expedia booth on Front street in Lahiana). Is was nice for our two teens to walk over for a shake or burger (great burgers!) for under $10 a meal. We also enjoyed the pizza and starters at BJ's Pizza in Lahaina - we ate and watched the harbor action ocean-side from their second story location right on Front street. We took in lots of various activities - * surfing: use one of the many surf schools right on the harbor beach in Lahaina for the best pricing and friendly instructors. Best prices will be had if purchased when in Maui - preferably right in Lahaina. * snorkeling: we choose the Pacific Whale Foundation \"deluxe\" trip for stops at both Molokini and a secondary locale for snorkeling. The big appeal for us - and most of the people on these trips - is the time taken to locate dolphins during the trip. We were able to locate and boat with a pod of 12-13 dolphins that included 2 babies. They even 'surfed' with our catamaran for a while! We also saw loads of great fish, sea turtles (3 species), and beautiful corals and underwater sites. The provided food was excellent and the well-trained staff super. Highly Recommend the PWF packages. * sunrise bike ride on Haleakala: if this is of interest to you, do it early in your trip! We did this our second day and it was great despite having to get up at 2:15 AM. Hey, when else are you gonna' be able to do this sort of thing? ;-) We asked around and used the Mountain Riders organization. Nice bikes, very friendly guides, good vans, and best-price packages (ask for a multiple-rider discount if you have more than 3 in your party). The sunrise was spectacular our morning and the brief stop at the summit observatory was a nifty bonus. The stop for breeakfast was very welcomed and the food was excellent. * horseback riding: we used the Mendez Ranch and all I can say is WOW! The BEST setup, the BEST people, the BEST horses, and the BEST views and riding environment hands-down. Moderate prices, but well worth the littel extra. Great BBQ lunch after the morning ride too if you're interested. Ride first in the morning, have lunch with the cowboys, and then stop at Iao State Park on the way home. A great day! * beach time: You can't beat the beachside Cabana right at the Eldo! Seriously, the Kaanapali beach is the best on Maui by any standards and the Eldo is smack in the middle of the best section. Great for swimming, boogie boarding, snorkeling (especially right nearby around the 'black rock'), and loads of sunbathing and beachwalking opportunities. We also checked out the beaches south of Lahaina for more surfing (rented a board) and snorkeling (also rented equipment - $9 a week per set!).

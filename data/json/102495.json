I stayed in room 114 9/20-9/22. There were two double beds, and 4 lamps in the room. Only 1 lamp worked, the box spring on both beds were tattered and stained and the frame was not attached to the wall. Its supposed to include eating utensils and pots and pans. There were two plastic cups so worn and stained my wife and I refused to drink out of them. Just for the heck of it I opened the oven and it looks at though it had never been cleaned. There were unknown stains in the bathroon in several areas along with a big wad of dark colored hair in the corner near the bath tub. It looked as though the maids were either on strike or just didn't give a damn. The staff was friendly but that was the only positive about my two nights in this filthy hotel. The television is from the 1980's and there was only 1 chair in the room. I cannot imagine this room being an extended stay. I've seen jail cells with more ambiance.

That trip was from hell so I was able to stay at the Deluxe for free. The lobby is small and cozy. The exercise room is small as a walk in closet with 3 treadmills. Wi-fi is NOT FREE! I loved the location of our room because it was all the way at the end of hall. We were not between two rooms just one to our left. I was close to the exit and was able to view my car out of my window. I mention that as a plus because guest, I assume they were guest, were in and out constantly! They were leaving rocks to keep the door open. It made me a bit nervous but I guess no one from the street would walk into the hotel. Our room was clean. The bed slept okay, nothing fancy. The big chair had cigarette holes and wires sticking out that it almost tore my shirt. I never sat in the chair due to the holes but hubby found it comfortable. The let out couch was great for the kids. I hated the fridge because you had to stand away from it to open. It was very annoying and it never got cold. The freezer worked well. Bathing the kids was a choir because we had to use a rag to plug the drain. My hubby left his toothbrush and they have signs stating how they could provide you with one. I went to the front desk and they did not have any however fresh sheets and blankets were available. Shopping is close by so if you had to go to the grocery store or to Wal-mart, it is convenient. In conclusion, the bug traps were visible from behind the couch and corners of the bed. It was a free stay and again, I don't think I'd go back.

The room smelled a little like burnt food, but it is expected with a full kitchen. I did notice the smoke alarms were not plugged up and immediately informed the staff. The trip seemed smooth, I had no problems up until the morning I planned on checking out. Around 8 am, someone called the room asking if we were checking out. We told them we were and they advised us that check out was 11am. We went back to sleep, a little bothered because we didn't ask for a wakeup call. Around 850am, someone knocked, then banged loudly on our door, saying \"hello, are you checking out today, hello.\" I got up and went to the door and said yes, we told them that on the phone, the woman said \"okay well check out is at 11am.\" My husband was furious but I calmed him down and ensured him that it was probably just a mix up. Not even an hour later, the same woman comes to our room and actually attempts to open the door, my husband was in the middle of getting dressed and if the safety lock was not on the door she would have walked in on him undressed! I was completely furious by then and when I went down to check out, I asked for the name of the woman that behaved so rudely. There was a nice young gentlemen, however, that was very apologetic and tried to put us as ease while checking out. He gave us a minor discount and apologized many times afterward.

The corners of the room have some sort of brown crust accumulating. I had to leave and purchase some sanitizing wipes to prevent myself from vomiting. It does not help that people are allowed to cook in their rooms. The entire floor smells like a take-out restaurant. Hotel guests obviously unhappy with their own disgusting food smelling up their rooms put their garbage outside their room in the hallway. The only problem is that this establishment has no maid staff on the premises. Cleaning is only done every few days. Rotting food sitting around for hours on end leaves the entire hotel smelling like a sewer. I felt as though a film of filth was accumulating on me the longer I stayed in the hotel. Interestingly enough I filled out a survey trashing this disgusting establishment. The only thing this accomplished was getting me on Extended Stay's mailing list. Now I get e-mails every other day advertising their hotel rates. Complaining to the staff does nothing. When the person at the desk asked me how my stay was, I told them how horrible it was.

The bed was very comfortable, I thought (and I'm used to the plushy digs at Hampton Inn, Sheraton, etc). I slept like a log.

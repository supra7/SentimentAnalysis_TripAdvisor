{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Stay away from Preferred Pl.! I just got home from a trip to Dallas, where I stayed at the BVI on Preferred Pl.  The rates were good, but the room was far from good and certainly not the best value! The bathroom had dead bugs on the floor, the bathtub area was rather moldy, there was NO soap in the room, only a couple of shampoo packets. There were 2 old worn bath towels and one small washcloth and that was all for towels. There were NO glasses to drink from, but there was an ice bucket. The hanging rack was missing from the portable closet, and of course there were no hangers either. The tv remote was nowhere to be found and one of the lamps had a burned out bulb. The smoke detector also looked as if it hadn't been functional for some time, just some wires hanging out of the body of it. The carpet near the sink was loose and flopped over. I usually don't mind an older room that may look a bit tired, but the basics really should be provided!The clerk did give me a bulb, some soap and glasses when I went and asked. I didn't bother asking for any towels, since I didn't want to shower among the dead bugs!Had I been planning on more than a one night stay, I would have found a different place to stay!Mike S.", "Date": "May 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR989493572", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sstraveler"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98652-r5068693-Best_Value_Inn-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "98652", "Price": "$36"}}

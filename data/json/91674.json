No crazy slot machines! There was a great complimentary coffee service (cappacino and espresso included) and muffins in the morning but the great thing was that the room had a Keurig coffee machine in it. If you travel to Vegas often, you know most hotels won't provide coffee machines unless you have a presidential suite. I like coffee when I get up and don't want to trudge through the lobby to find a Starbucks (that might not be open). The spa was relaxing. The exercise room was great. Service was excellent everywhere but the restaurant (but we went at an odd time and the service was good, just not Four Seasons style). I would definitely stay here again.

As so many others said, the customer service was absolutely top notch and that is what will take us right back to FS on our next trip to Vegas. Oh yes........there will be another trip! We had a Premium Strip-view suite, on the 37th floor. The views were amazing all the time, but they were the best at night. The room was spotlessly clean and we do not have one complaint at all, about anything. We loved having the express elevators, so we never had to wait more than a minute for them. We loved being right there with MB and all the access that came with that. The bed was as comfy and we slept so well on it. One thing I did not know before we went (and I read A LOT of Trip Advisor), was the tram that goes from MB to Luxor and Excalibur. That was great to have, because those walks are longer than they look. However, the only complaint we have about that is the hours. For it to be Vegas, these trams do not run the late or early hours. (This is part of MB, so it has no reflection on Four Seasons). So, we ended up having to take a last-minute taxi down to Excalibur. We had to catch our bus out to the Nascar race and did not have enough time to walk it once I found out the tram did not begin running until 9am that morning.

My wife and I booked a strip view suite for a few nights as part of our honeymoon tour of the US. Upon arrival at the Mandalay Bay the first immediate \"exclusive\" feel you get is walking past the queues for Mandalay check-in to the smaller dedicated FS check in- more staff & no queue. In fact as soon as you enter the FS section of the ground floor you can hear and feel the hussle bussle of the Mandalay Bay fade away behind you giving way to the quiet and more reserved but tasteful decor of the Four Seasons. You then take the exclusive FS elevator to the upper floors but to be honest our first room, fantastic by usual standards, didn't quite live up to our expectation. The view of the strip was very much at an angle, we didn't really face it and the size felt to me like it fell a little short of what we expected. So we asked to be moved and the process took half an hour or so, but was well worth it. We were moved to a top floor room that was both larger and faced directly down The Strip. Perfect. The rooms are again quite understated in the way they are fitted out, much like the other area of the FS Hotel, but they ooze class, are exceptionally comfortable and ideally suited to the type of guests this hotel is looking to attract. One thing I would criticise is the cost of the wi-fi in the room - I can't remember exactly how much but it was an extortionate amount for 24hrs and the one thing that left a bit of a bad taste in the mouth. You get the use of all the Mandalay facilities & I didn't get the impression the couple of FS restaurants are particularly well used but certainly the pool area is fantastic as the Mandalay pools are very busy & noisy whereas the Four Seasons pool area is like a tranquil oasis in comparison. The location is at the effective end of the strip on the opposite end to the Wynn Hotels. Might be slightly more convenient to be more centrally located as it's easy to underestimate journey times to get from one hotel to another in Vegas, so guess that would be one argument to stay elsewhere.

I was really surprised, since on other occasions I had noticed that hotels tend to give the \"less charming rooms\" to customers who book trhogh EXPEDIA and other websites. The staff was always helpful and ready to go the extra mile, from the reception till the concierge. We loved the pool and the delicious Italian restaurant and the fact that here again the staff is really extra and tries to help in any way. GREAT WINE LIST! The only negative side (but it's maybe not the hotel's fault...) the mail I left to send while I was leaving never arrived... If the Hotel is a bit distant from the rest of the STRIP, this soon proved to be an advantage, because it is quiter! We would certainly go back to the Four Seasons!", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cA Touch of Class\u201d", "Author": "Sandi F", "ReviewID": "UR125753931", "Content": "The rooms were beautiful!

The room service food was delicious and the waitstaff very friendly, fast, and efficient. A little on the expensive side, but isn't room service always expensive? I did like the fact that the gratuity was already included. I think the thing I liked the most about the hotel was that it was not crowed like all of the other strip hotels. When I wanted crowds, gambeling, etc, I just went down the elevator and into the Mandalay Bay. When I wanted some peace and quiet, it was right back the the Four Seasons.

The hotel was great and housekeeping staff really courteous and helpful. However, on the night of the 30th, my 21-year old daughter wanted to head back to the room but my husband was still playing at the casino. My daughter was happy to go back to the room by herself but, after discussion with my husband who said he wouldn't be much longer, I went with her. As we got to our floor, about halfway down, a young man wearing a hooded jacket with the hood up was just standing. As we approached him, he started walking ahead of us. When he got to the end of the corridor, he again just stood still. As he heard the click of the roompass, he turned around and headed back towards us. Knowing I couldn't get into the room before he could get his foot in the door, I stood outside and my daughter entered the room. The man and I just watched each other until he had passed down the corridor. Unsettled by the incidence, I phoned the front desk to tell them about the man. No one got back to me but, luckily, my husband saw him leave the Four Seasons lobby and had noticed him because he still had the hood up. Replying to a survey, I said I thought even a note under our door would have been reassuring. After another email, I did get a phone call from the hotel saying that someone else had also reported the man and, unfortunately, \"Las Vegas does attract a criminal element\". They said that their Security had been unable to locate the man. I appreciate that it wasn't the hotel's fault that the man was there but their response was poor. Also I cannot understand how my husband managed to see this man a good 5-10 minutes after I (and someone else) reported the man but the hotel security could not. The hotel is not that large nor does it have many exits. It would also have been reassuring to know at the time that they had taken by concern seriously.

The Four Seasons is ranked as one of the best hotels in Vegas, so I went in with some pretty high expectations. I can honestly say this hotel met, if not exceeded, every single one of them. At Encore, any request I made to the staff was answered with either \"No\" or \"That costs extra.\" Compare that to Four Seasons, where they offer complimentary water during check-in, complimentary coffee and tea, complimentary shoe shines, complimentary newspaper of your choice, complimentary turn-down service, and even a complimentary house car that will take you anywhere you want to go within a three-mile radius. In addition to all these amenities, the staff actively went out of their way to accommodate me, even greeting me by name when I walked through the lobby. This was a welcome change to the rest of the city, where you're just another face in the crowd. In fact, the entire hotel felt like an escape from Vegas - there were no lines during check-in or check-out, no masses of people crowding around a nightclub, no shrieking or laughing coming through a connecting door, and not a single slot machine to be heard as you walk through the hallways. It's an oasis of serenity in one of the most vibrant cities on Earth. There are downsides, unfortunately. The dreaded resort fee is here, although if an extra $20 per night will break your budget, this probably isn't the best hotel for you. Mandalay Bay, which houses the Four Seasons, is located on the far end of the strip, meaning it's a long walk to anywhere. There are only two restaurants specific to the Four Seasons, a steakhouse and a caf\u00e9, and both are quite pricey (though the food is excellent). Finally, it can be a bit of a scavenger hunt to find where the entrance to the hotel is hidden, especially after a long day and a few drinks. Despite these few problems, it's easy to see why the Four Seasons holds a place as one of the top hotels in Las Vegas.

The Verandah restaurant was the perfect host to our Thanksgiving dinner, providing a meal with all the traditional trimmings, as well as a meatless version for those of us who are vegetarian. We sat out on the patio with heat lamps warming us and could not have enjoyed ourselves more. We walked away with full bellies and sore cheeks from laughing and enjoying ourselves so much. The spa is beautiful--smaller than most, but ideal for the quiet hotel it calls home--and Heidi, the massage therapist, gave a great massage. I liked the fact that it was fairly small and quiet. It made it easy to feel at home and comfortable. The rooms were well-appointed and clean. They do show some age--the handle on our bathroom sink leaked when we turned it on and the TV in my in-laws room died while they were there. But the staff leapt to replace the TV as soon as they were called. It took 15 minutes from the time my mother-in-law called until they had a new TV, installed and working. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning our room daily. They added little touches, such as slippers at turn-down. My father-in-law couldn't fit the size medium slippers they left behind, so he put a note requesting larger ones. That night and from then on they left him large-sized slippers. This made his week. Finally, my husband had to work while we were there. The internet was fast and consistent and it was easy for him to get set up at the provided desk with all the provided outlets. The Four Seasons Las Vegas is a perfect hotel for those who want a quieter, non-smoking Vegas experience with access to everything the Strip offers. The only downside about it is that it is at the FAR END of the South side of the Strip, so if you have shows further north (and most shows are), you have to make arrangements to get there, either by renting a car, taking a taxi or using the hotel's courtesy car service, if it is available.

The only suggestion, and one I never mentioned to the hotel, is to add a thin blanket to the beds. There is a wonderful soft, fluffy comforter with a sheet. However, I always became warm at night and would like the addition of a thin blanket. The thermostatic doesn't make the room cool enough for the thick comforter.

Here's a quick summary of its pros and cons. PROS: No casino for those who want a quiet place to stay in Las Vegas. Private pool for FS guests only. Excellent restaurants on premise -- Verandah and Charlie Palmer. Decent fitness center and spa. Early check-in and out requests are generally accommodated. Easy access to Mandalay Bay and its pools and excellent restaurants. CONS: Noisy location next to McCarran Airport. Intolerable shrieking sound coming through room door when windy outside. Affected by internal construction noise from Mandalay Bay. New resort fee to access fitness center which was previously complimentary (internet access, however, is thrown in) Inconsistent quality of spa services. Last massage left me extremely sore and nauseous for a few days. An excellent massage therapist wouldn't let this happen. Non-descript rooms and suites -- decor lacks personality. Beds are not comfortable and the towels smell like harsh detergent. No special amenities in suites such as TVs in bathrooms or steam showers. Showers tend to leak a significant amount of water. AC system is very loud and not conducive to a relaxing atmosphere. TVs don't appear to be HD. Only valet parking is available. Front desk staff can be brusque or condescending at times. Overall, the cons sadly outweigh the positives. The kicker is that the Four Seasons tends to charge more than other properties. With all its shortcomings -- how can this be justified? It's long past time for the Four Seasons to step up its game. With other five-star properties in town offering lower rates, it is simply getting harder to justify staying there.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but a bit behind the new casinos.\u201d", "Author": "knightline", "ReviewID": "UR121220884", "Content": "I stayed here when the hotel first opened - then again in December of 2010.

I recomend the burger and also the nachos-very filling, my brother had the seared tuna salad which he loved! Easy access to the Mandalay Bay pool, we never went through as the Four Seasons was just too perfect. Verranda-went here once for happy hour. Was very calm and relaxing and the drinks were good too $5 and were very strong. The private lift also takes you to the casino floor. This is where you access Mandalay Bay. As soon as you step into here you really feel the difference. We did spend a lot of time in the Mandalay bay casino, had a great enviroment but we were happy at the end of the night to take our private lift up to the room. Car parking - We used the self car park at the Mandalay Bay and only used the valet at Four Seasons through the day. This is because at the Four Seasons you can valet your car as many times as you want throughout the day but if you keep overnight you get charged $22. It is only a 5minute walk from Four Seasons to self car park. Also everytime you collect your car from Four Seasons valet they provide you with bottled water. Conseige - Anything you need advice with or help they supply. I needed directions to Red Rock canyon they provided, directions to Hoover Dam they provided, tickets for a helicopter ride to Grand canyon they called booked and organised. Brilliant service! I would always recommend this hotel as I wouldnt change anything about it even the car parking situation. Ten out of ten for everything.

On this basis we looked at the non gaming hotels and picked the Four Seasons and we were glad we did. The hotel is amazing if you want to enjoy the madness of Vegas and then come home at the end of the day and shut the door on it all. You could be anywhere in the world in the Four Seasons but you have all the amenities on hand. The service is great buy you pay the price for that, however is there anywhere cheap in Vegas? Breakfast for four of us in the hotel was around \u00a3100 - I have to confess one day we went to McDonalds across the road for \u00a325! Ours were the only kids in the hotel for the full 8 nights they were there. My kids are fine with this (as are we!!) but if you want kids clubs and other children to mix with then this hotel (in fact Vegas on the whole) is not the place to take them. The service round the pool is very much 5 star with chilled face towels, frozen fruit, fresh smoothies, sun cream and aloe vera and even complimentary hot chocolates (when it gets to 70 degrees) on a daily basis. The daily room fee is steep at $50 each (even the kids have to pay it which I think it pretty outrageous). The service is generally under stated and they do a great happy hour in the bar 4-7pm with $5 cocktails and small plates which we absolutely maxed out on! Our total dissappointement with the hotel was more for the kids than us. They said if you email in advance we will have welcome amenities and chocolate jigsaws for the kids. I did this a month in advance and it never happened even though I asked twice (it became embarassing after this) and they said they would send a birthday cake for my daughter in the middle of our stay, this never happened either. The night befoer we were due to leave the service kicked up a notch, not surprising as tips were due to housekeeping etc the next day, I don't like this. The Four Seasons is little known in Vegas and I like it this way, I would gladly return. You are connected to the Mandalay Bay so it's like being in the madness of it all with a door to tranquility (you will no doubt read other reviews about the 'secret door').

A friend and I decided to treat my mom to some shows and the Four Seasons for her 60th birthday celebration. We managed to book and amazing deal with Allegiant air that included airfare and hotel for only $60 more than staying at other 4 star hotels on the strip, so already, this was shaping up to be a good deal. I was so excited about the entire trip and our action packed itinerary, and it did not disappoint. I love it when you're hotel actually lives up to your expectations. Check-In: The check-in process was easy and quick. When asked if we wanted to upgrade to a strip view room, I asked the FD agent if it would be possible to upgrade us for my mom's birthday. She quickly smiled, worked on her computer, and offered us the complimentary upgrade as a \"goodwill gesture\" for our celebration. A very nice start to the trip indeed. Room: The room was probably the only real disappointment for our stay. While the view of the strip was indeed nice, I would probably not have paid for the upgrade had I viewed the 2 rooms and was happy it was offered complimentary. It was also not as luxurious as other Four Seasons I have stayed in before (Jackson, Amman, Cairo) and the room itself seemed like a very well appointed/upscale Intercontinental, Hyatt, Hilton, but nothing incredibly special. The bathroom was much nicer and more along the lines of what you would expect in a Four Seasons. The \"free\" (daily resort fee really pays for this) Wifi was welcome and worked well enough to watch TV, so that was good. Also liked that it extended throughout the property, including the pool. Concierge: I had contacted the property before our arrival and asked about the Lion King dinner and show packages. Cara helped me and we exchanged a few emails and phone calls in which she also helped us plan other activities for our stay. She was very prompt and super friendly and helpful and made that great first impression you hope your staff will make when working with incoming guests. She also greeted us warmly when we arrived on property and helped make additional suggestions for our stay. Her service was the additional spark you are hoping for when you stay at a five stay property. Housekeeping: Housekeeping was good and prompt and responded quickly to our request for additional towels and amenities... I love the l'occitane products at the Four Seasons. Only major issue here was on our second day on property, my mom had become ill and was in the room most of the day. We had our DND sign on the door, but then left the room at 6pm for our dinner that evening and removed the DND, expecting to get our room cleaned. Upon returning after 11, our room had not been serviced for turn down. Especially when I have not had my room serviced all day, it is a real bummer to return to a messy room, and I think housekeeping should have checked to make sure that we had received service. This prompted me to call housekeeping and request what time we would like service for the rest of our stay, but I feel like I shouldn't have to do that in a five star property. Pool: The pool alone is the main reason that someone should check into this property. We spent 3 days lounging by the pool and it was relaxed, with excellent service and so serene. The pool attendants checked on us regularly to bring cocktails or food and about hourly, a dedicated staff member went around the pool offering fresh frozen fruit or cooling misting spray. Our first day the group decided to venture over to the Mandalay Bay Pool, thinking we would like to try our turn on the lazy river and the chaos that awaited us as we walked through the gates to the pool made us quickly decide we would not spend one more minute over at their pool. It was such a stark contrast with the screaming kids, loud music, and haphazard chairs and obstacles, that we vowed never to return and safely spent the rest of our vacation at the peaceful pool at the 4S!! Parking: Valet is great, but if you want to save the $22 a day, self park is around the back of the casino and not that far off a walk (by Vegas standards!) We chose to use that money for cocktails by the pool....Valley of Fire being our favorite! Other facilities: The beauty of this property is that you have access to all the amenities of the Mandalay Bay and its many restaurants, but also the choice to stay in the little quiet cocoon of the Four Seasons. This was something very appealing about the property and did make a difference when deciding if I wanted to pay a HUGE premium for the Four Seasons spa or the Mandalay Bay Spa. It's nice that guests have a choice to do either. Minor complaints: Three very nitpicky complaints I would want to point out. When we ordered room service, we were told it would be delivered by 8:35 and it arrived at 8:43. I know this is very minor, but a property like this should under promise and over deliver. Also, I noticed on multiple occasions when I called the Front Desk, I would be asked to hold and then placed on hold for a couple of minutes. I felt like they should have dedicated staff for answering phones during peak times, because the wait times did not seem ideal for the Four Seasons....elsewhere fine, but not here. Lastly, I wanted my bill the evening before check out and the FD agent did not preprint that night's fees and taxes. When I called down again to ask for a complete bill, he told me that his system was not allowing him to preprint the charges. I don't know of a single hotel in the world that cannot do this and some retraining should probably be done to make sure that a guest is able to get a complete bill the night before check out, since this is a very common request. Although, very minor issues that did not affect our stay, still some areas where there could be a tiny bit of improvement. While I want to give this property an excellent rating (it really was like a 4.5), it did have a few minor areas for improvement and the housekeeping issue on our second day was probably the only reason I would not rate it along the other 5 star resorts I have stayed at before. I would however highly recommend staying here if you would like to get away from the \"hustle and bustle\" of Vegas and this quiet, calm, relaxing property deserves all its praise. There is no comparison to hotels in Vegas, but it has a bit or room to compare to some of its other Four Seasons counterparts.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cNot so Vegas\u201d", "Author": "SoulFitGirl", "ReviewID": "UR119623068", "Content": "If you're looking for that incomprehensible bargain, where you pay $40 per night but every linen is sure to be saturated in cigarette smoke and remnants of the previous occupants might linger in hidden corners, this isn't your place.

Jason at the front desk checked us in quickly and brought us ice cold bottles of water. This relaxing experience of the check-in process on a Friday late afternoon was far and above many hotels we\u2019ve stayed at before (the Wynn, TheHotel, Bellogio, Cosmopolitan to name a few) It\u2019s probably due to the amount of rooms at the Four Seasons vs other mega hotels.

The door that leads to Mandalay Bay from the Four Seasons complete shuts the noise off. It was day and night difference when you open that door.

The bedroom was large and well appointed and decorated in a classic style , it did not have a wow factor that other 5 star hotel rooms may have but it was very comfortable.

The bathroom had a good walk in shower, separate WC(no silly see through door either) and nice bathrobes and toiletries.

The pool area was lovely, green and restful and the pool staff greet guests on arrival and set up seats in shady or sunny areas as requested. I checked the pool as the Mandalay Bay and it was not for me, no shade, very busy with loud music and a wave pool but I can see how it would appeal to some.

Upon check-in, we discovered that we'd been given a room with two double beds, when we'd reserved a king. The staff flew into action to switch us to a king room immediately, which also involved re-routing our room service tray of champagne and strawberries that my husband had pre-ordered as a surprise for me. That delivery was taken care of, and included as a surprise to us both was a chocolate birthday cake, which my husband hadn't even ordered. In addition, a lovely handwritten birthday note welcoming us both was on the tray. We were delighted with the extra touches that really made our arrival even more special than intended, and those extra touches were repeated throughout our stay. Upon our arrival back in the room late that first night, we were \"greeted\" by the deafeningly loud music and reverberations from the concert going on 36 floors below at the Mandalay Bay beach. I also was not feeling well, adding to the discomfort. Neither I nor my husband, who regularly sleeps with earplugs, and thus had some with him, could fathom sleeping amid that noise, and we were very disappointed since we'd specifically chosen the Four Seasons as a haven from the Vegas craziness. We asked each other how the hotel could bill itself as such an exclusive enclave with the knowledge of these Mandalay Bay concerts. My husband called the front desk and explained the dilemma, and they sprung to action, sending a bellman to move us to the other side of the hotel, into an enormous suite, to our surprise. All was perfectly quiet thereafter. Not stopping there, the staff also gave us a 20% discount card to the Verandah restaurant, which we used the next evening, and a $50 gift card to the Spa, which I was more than happy to use. The next morning, I received a very considerate call from a hotel assistant manager who apologized for our trouble and asked if she could do anything further for us, particularly me, as she knew I'd been feeling poorly. We spent two days relaxing poolside, and the pool staff was a major highlight of our experience at the hotel. All were extremely accommodating and eager to help, striking a perfect balance between prompt availability and unobtrusive service. Our every need, along with some we didn't know we had, was met efficiently and pleasantly. Our lunch at the poolside bar was fantastic, and our dinner meal at Verandah was exquisite - service and food. The air conditioned patio is genius, and we thoroughly enjoyed dining poolside without being subject to the Vegas heat. My experience at the Spa was fabulous - one of the best body scrub/massage treatments I've ever had. My husband and I travel and dine out frequently, and our benchmark for good service has become just that, \"service.\" Mistakes, accidents and misfortune happen anywhere and everywhere; the measure of an establishment is the manner in which such events are handled. The Four Seasons has this crucial aspect of service distilled to a science, and it is this level of responsiveness and accommodation that prompted this announcement to my husband: \"I ONLY want to stay at Four Seasons wherever we go from now on!\" They've spoiled me for all else.

The soundproofing of the room was really good. Our room faced the airport and we didn't hear any noise from outside. If we come back to Las Vegas we'll choose the same hotel.

Waw ! we really enjoyed this 5* hotel. You enter through the Mandalay Bay hotel and the casino but once you arrive there, what a calm. This is the first time in a Four Seasons hotel and it surely impressed us. Some good points : - very quiet - it has the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay so you can have a spectacular view of the Strip from the South. The Strip is wonderful in the evening. - very close to the airport but no noise as you cannot open the windows, but you have fresh air intakes. A/C is working of course. - very good concierge desk and I want hereby to thank the staff for helping us out with some reservations troubles. Use them to book a show, helicopter tour or restaurant. They know all the good places ! - very good room service - very clean (hotel is new since 2006 I think) - very good bed - huge LCD screen with dvd player, safe, coffee machine - (!) you can decide when the housekeeping is done by choosing a time frame. No more housekeeping at 8am. - very good private pool - very good restaurants that are quiet and with excellent service (maybe a bit expensive but this is Vegas) - breakfast \u00e0 la carte - private hotel entry for taxis Points to take into account : - the hotel is located at the south of the strip so you need a cab to go downtown. But there are a lot of shops in the Mandalay Bay resort itself.But honestly, it is indeed an oasis in SinCity. - you cannot open the windows and no balcony as the rooms are on the top floors.

The rates are competitive with other high-end hotels on the strip, but you get the added benefit of a smaller hotel with personal service. The rooms are great (pay the extra for the view), the pool and restaurants are lovely and the service is top-notch. All guests have access to Mandalay Bay's facilities, but you won't stay long in the chaos before retreating back to the Four Seasons.

Check in was fine although the guy who dealt with us didn't feel it necessary to give us water (as is normal and all other guests had) and I found him rather fake and smarmy. We went for a one bedroom suite this time and the room was impeccably appointed, the only slight issue was that for some reason the shower was smaller than we\u2019ve had before with a wobbly faucet and its door wouldn't shut properly. Normally this sort of thing is picked up by the maids, but not on this occasion. Despite this everything was going great until our first Wednesday. Down by the pool the usual water refills weren't forthcoming and it appeared as if all the staff were either in a bad mood or had received some bad news because they were pretty much absent. This mood continued when we went down to get a car and all the staff ignored us (normally they are there straight away asking us if we would like a cab/car etc), and after waiting for 5 minutes we had to ask for a cab as they were having their own little conversation between themselves. Not very impressive. When we returned to the room later that day there was a message from the front desk. When I called downstairs to find out what it was about I unfortunately got the smarmy guy again and he explained what the issue was. Although nothing major, I was not impressed that when I pointed out that some of the information that he had provided us with at check-in was lacking, he was far too quick to say it was my fault. Which as it turns out, it wasn't. I was fuming when I came off the phone, this is the sort of attitude I\u2019d expect from the Mandalay Bay, not the Four Seasons. The next day a lady from the front desk called specifically to apologise which made things better but the original person didn't bother. He is someone I will avoid in the future. I don't pay to be patronised. All in all though the stay was great, the pool service was a little hit and miss at time in terms of getting fresh ice, and weirdly enough, this took a dip when they were quieter, but the staff was mainly friendly and accommodating. It is worth noting that I had the best massage ever experienced in the Spa, 80 minute Four Seasons with Spinal Detox - something very special!!

We were the first ones to the pool one morning, and after being there for almost 2 hours, an attendant came over and asked us to move to another area b/c another family had requested it? We politely accepted the move, but thought that was rather rude. We also asked for a massage pool side, our waitress said \"You are next, she should be right over\". It took her over 2 hours to come over. We asked if we could order another person to come out, that we didn't care what it would cost, and she said no one else was available from the spa. The cool mist downs and frozen fruit were great, I did see staff complain and roll their eyes when someone asked for some fruit...

Of course Vegas is fun -- restaurants, shopping, hitting the tables and some pretty cool shows -- but it's also chaotic and phenomenally cheesy (right?). The Four Seasons hotel (attached to the Mandalay Bay) was a terrific value (about $200 a night mid-week), right in the thick of things (doors lead right into the Mandalay Bay craziness) but also can be isolated, calm and beautiful in its own right. Initially, my thirteen year old and her friend hit the Mandalay Bay beach pool right outside the gated Four Seasons pool, where they could frolic within safe texting distance, but my wife and I barely left the much nicer and insane-less Four Seasons pool. A couple of wonderful touches: the pool staff brought us free pitchers of iced and fruited water, and continuously refreshed the pitchers with more ice and water. On incredibly hot days, your normal luxury hotel (and certainly your normal Vegas hotel) would love to take advantage of the heat by having friendly wait staff take your orders for vastly overpriced cold drinks and you'd be thankful for it normally when they brought you those drinks. The Four Seasons' approach of having diligent, friendly people constantly bringing us free water (as well as crazy but perfect items like free Otter Pops and free cinnamon-infused frozen melon balls) was a small but awesome touch. Other great things -- the pool was never crowded, there were cabana like day beds under shaded fans and there was no charge for using those day beds, again a far cry from the Mandalay Bay (which I like by the way) but which would charge you at least an additional $200 a day to use a similar cabana. In general, the Four Seasons' staff walks a great tightrope -- a lot of luxury hotel staff can be wonderfully pleasant, but, at the end of the day, kind of hopelessly useless; at the Four Seasons, we were impressed not just by the genuine pleasantness of the staff, but the actual and real competence and diligence they uniformly displayed, from doing things like running us over to spots in Vegas in brand new air conditioned Mercedes' cars (again, for free) to finding us really good restaurants perfectly within our value range. Another nice touch: unlimited use of the small but very nice fitness center was also, again, free and part of the room charge. I have stayed at nearly all of the best hotels in Vegas -- Encore, Bellagio, Wynn, Cosmopolitan (which I like a lot). It took me awhile to try the Four Seasons (for some reason, I was afraid it would be too overpriced, stuffy or removed), but having done so, I am completely sold.

The best part was clearly that due to the location next to the Mandalay Bay Hotel we could enjoy the best of both worlds: The kids loved the wave pool and the Lazy River at the Mandalay Bay while we adults preferred the serenity of the smaller but secluded Four Seasons pool. No one had to compromise! The hotel was elegant and quiet and we basically never saw and heard anyone. At the same time staff was very helpful and there when we needed them. We were glad we didn\u00b4t stay in any of the more typical, noisy and overcrowded hotels in more central locations on the Strip. The view of our room was amazing and room service excellent!

From check-in the staff were exceptional. The Four Seasons hotel sits atop the Mandalay Bay hotel, occupying floors 35 - 39, so by definition you are guaranteed a high floor! The room itself was very spacious, with a very generously sized bathroom. The Beds were large and incredibly comfortable, and when we asked for an extra duvet, they brought 2! The rooms were cleaned incredible well, for example in the shower they lined up our toiletries in descending height order: just a little thing to let you know that you're at a FS hotel. The Lobby was also beautifully laid out. There is the Asian theme to it, however it is not over-the-top (like most other hotels in Vegas!), but they have done it in a way that is really nice to look at. The Four Seasons Pool service is exceptional, the Pool is the perfect size, no deeper than 5 feet anywhere, and normally when we went in there were not too many people in the pool. The hotel itself is not crowded, which is a rare thing to find in a city such as Vegas. In all the other hotels we visited (eg Venetian, Rio etc), even at 5pm there were people checking in. There is also the benefit of there not being a casino, so there was no smoking in the hotel. It is possible to get from the Mandalay Bay hotel to the Four Seasons Hotel, but if you don't know where you're going, it can get very confusing! This hotel is exceptional, and if visiting Las Vegas I would definitely reccomend it, because it is less crowded, exceptional, FS standard service, and no musky cigarette smell everywhere, unlike many other hotels in Vegas!

We were not disappointed; the hotel lived up to our high expectations and all the great fetures/benefits mentioned by other reviewers, albeit with a few issues that could easily be addressed. The Good We had a standard view one-bedroom suite on the 39th floor, consisting of two large rooms, one with an oversised and very comfortable king bed, the other with a sofa bed and wet bar. The bedroom has a full-sized bathroom attached with bath and shower, the other room has a half-bathroom with a hand-basin. Both rooms have large flat-screen TVs with DVD players, bedroom had iPod dock/alarm clock combination. The rooms were spacious with floor to ceiling windows and plenty of storage space. Cooling levels were good in the rooms despite it being 100+F/40+C outside the large windows. We did need to crank it up during the morning when the sun was shining in to the room but it coped very well in the middle of summer. Location at the end of the strip was fine for us - we were there for a relaxing break, to see the (natural) scenery and to catch a few shows. Taxis were generally $14-$18 (including tip) and 10 minutes max to/from the heart of the strip. A big plus is that there are no lines to get a taxi at 4S. Contrast that with a 30 min taxi line outside Caesar's Palace (you wouldn't want to walk more than a few blocks at this time of year). The Four Seasons pool was great on every level. Well furnished with comfortable new loungers, fantastic poolside attendants and no problem getting somewhere to sit as the staff at the pool set up chairs for you (in the sun or in the shade) and clear them down fairly quickly when people leave. Some of the seating was next to hidden speakers playing a selection of current tunes. Seats right next to them were rather loud, but there were other areas where you couldn't hear the music at all. We never had a problem finding a spot to suit us. The pool was large enough for the number of people wanting to use it. The kids liked getting there early so they could have the whole thing to themselves, but even at the busiest times there were never more than a dozen people in the water. There were lots of people with younger kids at the pool, but they were well behaved and not overly noisy or crazy. The pool attendants don't allow large inflatables/tubes in the 4S pool or jumping/diving, but neither were they enforcing 'silence in the library' rules either. The adults standing in the water with their Kindles and smartphones all seemed happy enough. Food and drink service at the pool was fantastic - pricey but worth the money, and frankly no more expensive than many more average eating places in the city. We ate at the Verandah restaurant several times and again the food and service were good - the weekend brunch buffet was great. We're a family of vegetarians and there was plenty of choice on all the 4S menus except the Steakhouse (naturally). The Average With the exception of the bed, the furniture in the rooms was fairly average and functional. Perfectly adequate but certainly not the over-stuffed 'country house' armchairs depicted on the web site. Suspect that much of it has been replaced with lesser quaility items over the years. The sofa bed was fine for our two young(ish) and skinny kids, but I don't think an adult would find it at all comfortable - small, thin mattress, not very supportive. Room cleaning and turndown times were erratic. Some days the room was cleaned first thing, others late afternoon. Turndown was also erratic anywhere between 5:30pm and 9:30pm - given that they made up the sofa bed for the kids this was slightly problematic as we either ended up with nowhere to sit and watch TV or (on one occasion) had to call down so we could get the kids to bed. Not the end of the world, as a call to housekeeping would quickly resolve any problems but a bit more predictability would be helpful. Noise levels in the room were generally very good. We had a room overlooking the airport with four active runways and two busy helicopter tour companies almost opposite. You could hear aircraft and helicopters taking off and landing from about 6:00m to mid-evening, but only if you turned the A/C off first, so no worries there. There was a bit of misic noise from somewhere one evening -seemed to be coming from the A/C vent and might have been from the nightclub on the top floor, but we only heard it once and suspect it might have been from another guest room below. Again it wasn't overly intrusive or an issue. No rowdy parties banging and shouting in the hallways at 2:00am was a real bonus for a Vegas hotel. If you were overly bothered by noise you might be disturbed, but it was impressive for a room overlooking a busy airport to be far quieter than many city-centre hotels. The Bad Paying daily for WiFi and Valet parking is very poor show in this day and age. I'd happily pay for the valet service was very quick - we'd just turn up at the front door and the car would be there in a couple of minutes. Nobody wants to pay for a necessity like WiFi though. To make the point, I could pick up and use free WiFi service from THEhotel when sat at the Four Seasons pool. FS management needs to move with the times! The Mandalay Bay pool looks great in pictures and has the potential to be fantastic, but it is the perfect illustration that 'Hell is other people'. Packed pools, can't get a plastic sun lounger in full sun unless you turn up at opening time, loud music and bodies everywhere. Queues of crying children and teens emerging from the wave pool with bashed in eyes, noses and just about everything else due to the mob atmosphere. Even our kids could only stick it for 30 mins on a couple of days and we're talking about children who were happy to spend six or seven hours in the FS pool most days. The worst (only) badly behaved person at the FS pool all week was an 'adult' who was clearly incapable due to drink who had to be taken out in a wheelchair by a couple of smartly dressed security guards. Even that was handled without a fuss or disturbance, and you can hardly blame the hotel for it (suspect he had already had far too many before he arrived). Maintenance of electrical items in rooms really needs to be looked at by management. We found one table lamp with the bulb hanging inside the shade from wires. Another table lamp gave off a worrying smell of burning on the last night when switched on, and when I went to unplug it from the wall after switching off, the faceplate fell off the wall socket when the lamp cord was removed. These issues were reported to housekeeping who sent an engineer straight up and offered to move us to another room. We declined as we didn't want to be disturbed as this all happened as we were putting the kids to bed. Reported to the front desk in the morning (as we were checking out that day) and they promised to look in to it. Hope they do! Not an ideal end to the stay, and clearly some of the fittings are well past their sell-by dates. Without wishing to generalise, the wiring of US appliances generally leaves a lot to be desired compared to UK portable equipment, and this isn't the only hotel where I've experienced similar issues. Overall Would we go back? Yes I think we would. Having had a look around a few other hotels in Vegas this is right up there. The quality of the rooms and furniture does need updating somewhat, but it is still pretty good in my book, and the fantastic service from the staff and calm atmosphere of the hotel overall mark it out as something special.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe can't wait to return to the Four Seasons in Vegas!!\u201d", "Author": "CurlCouple", "ReviewID": "UR116546943", "Content": "Wow!

I really don't know where to start! Arrival and check in was pleasant and un eventfull and our room spacious and clean, however it's very noticeable that huge cutbacks have been made at the four seasons, the little things that made it the place to stay in Las Vegas. The calm and tranquility of the pool has gone, it's turned into a kids splash pool where parents let their children run riot, jumping in and out of the pool with no regard for the other users of the pool, no longer can you sit in the pool to keep cool whilst reading a book without it getting soaked! There was no intervention from pool attendants encouraging parents to take their children to the Mandalay pool which with a wave machine, beach and lazy river it's built for fun!

The pool staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, often referring to us by name. We were offered frozen melon balls, frozen pushup ice pops (love those!) and frozen mini Snickers. Our iced water pitchers were consistently refilled. They offer to clean your sunglasses as well. The staff practically tuck you into your lounge chair with fresh towels, but we chose a small, canopied cabana (I referred to it as my cabanita) which is perfect for two people to relax and get some shade when needed. They have a few on the premises for free but you have to get there early (8:30 am) to snag one, which is fine as they serve coffee, lattes and even made us FS version of a frappucino. Yum! Ok enough about the pool-we used the gym, even though we each needed gym clothes and sneakers. The gym/spa reception staff supplied us with clean, FS gym clothes during our stay. The steam/eucalyptus room is complimentary and was great! The Verandah restaurant, located next to the pool has a Happy Hour in which we enjoyed great drinks and small plates @ $5 each! Can't beat that! The housekeeping staff was stellar, coming in more than once a day to clean, organize bathroom toiletries and replenish L'Occitane products! Whoa! Room service was awesome as well. We were able to print our boarding passes for free on the hotel computer and the concierge was very helpful. We loved the privacy, luxury and serenity of the Four Seasons Las Vegas. When we wanted to venture into frenetic Las Vegas, we just went through the secret door and entered Mandalay Bay. Voila! The Four Seasons Las Vegas was the perfect retreat for us and allowed us to experience Las Vegas on our own terms. I'm afraid to tell my secret hideaway but I want other to enjoy it as well. One more note: we saw quite a few families with kids of all ages and it was great. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I would love to bring my nieces and nephew there as the FSLV seems very kid-friendly.

That said a few observations that are intended to help and hopefully not act as criticism per se. 1.The pool area is fairly small and playing loud music is okay but not what everyone wants on vacation,so a quiter area would be appreciated.There is no where else to sit and read quietly.I could not see outside misting machines used in lots of locations in Vegas which would have helped keep the area cooler, for those that say,sat in a designated area with this facility. 2.There is no in hotel coffee shop although you can work through to Starbucks etc in the adjoiing hotel if you fancy a longish walk to and from the hotel.Why not build a small upscale coffee shop (see the one in the Cosmopolitan for example) that sells nice coffees,upscale,sandwiches and cakes? We had an evening flight and despite a kind late check out at 2pm - we still had 6 hours to wait in the hotel - after a few hours around the pool and eating in the restaurant - we could only find the chairs opposite the check in - to sit and wait in - Im not convinced FS is making the best use of the space they have - eg on areas around the in hotel shop or on the 1st floor where the conference,business meeting rooms are situated. On a related subject there is only Charlie Palmer - which starts at circa $30 for a main or the inhouse FS restaurant (which is very good - service and food) so eating in the hotel bar room service is limited.Charlie Palmer was closed for a private party with Cisco (with no notice on the door either !) one of the nights we stayed. 3.The Spa staff were very nice but one minor irritation was there was no Spa Nail service only in the next spa in the Mandalay Bay - Im sure FS are missing out here not offering an express service for Nails or any other service - all treatments are aimed at the premium end eg $ 100 up. 4.Similar to other reviewers small things like no water in the room,no free wifi really is nickel and diming in our view. All in all the staff were very helpful as I stated at the beginning of this review - I think the point raised by another recent reviewer - that the hotel being part of the Mandalay Bay and having a somewhat old look and feel is part of the issue - I agree that FS should consider moving up the Strip to one of the newer developments - and refresh their local branding and presence - as a faithful FS client globally - I cant help but feel this would be a good,yes expensive - but overall worthwhile - strategic move for FS. Finally Thank you again to Ella and her team - who all work very hard to provide top service,that simply cannot be faulted.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHOOCHIE MAMA - Amazing view!\u201d", "Author": "Oliverocks", "ReviewID": "UR116126689", "Content": "We were upgraded to a 37th floor strip view room on arrival and boy oh boy was it a stunner!

Located high atop the Mandalay Bay, Four Seasons offers you a private sanctuary away from the casinos, away from the smoke and away from the noise found in all casino properties. While this hotel occupies the top five floors of the Mandalay Bay property, its services and staff are uniquely Four Seasons. There is a large Four Seasons sign on Las Vegas Blvd that marks the private entrance to the property. Valet parking is available for $22 per day or you can opt to park in the large parking lot, free of charge. Be prepared for a short, five-minute walk from the parking lot to the hotel entrance. Not a big deal, unless you loathe walking in desert heat. Your bellhop will escort you to the front desk and introduce you to your reservation agent. These folks are professional, yet friendly and make the check-in process hassle-free. Upon receiving your keys, you\u2019ll make a lovely walk down the corridor to the private elevators that will whisk you up to your oasis (floors 35-39). Rooms: furnished with all the amenities you\u2019d expect. The Strip-View suite is beautiful and worth the upgrade. Imagine looking down the strip at night, sipping your favorite drink with someone special next to you. If you treasure a quiet nights sleep, you\u2019re in the right place. Elevators: private use for card-carrying guests of the Four Seasons. There\u2019s a button marked \u201cC\u201d \u2013 that takes you to the floor with the Mandalay Bay casino, shops and restaurants. These private elevators are located in a secure, card-controlled lobby that limits access to Four Seasons guests only. Food: plenty of choices await your palate on this property. You need only decide what you\u2019re in the mood to eat, which is easier said than done when you have access to Mandalay Bays 22 restaurants in addition to the Four Seasons two restaurants, Charlie Palmers Steakhouse and the Verandah. Breakfast averaged $50 for two, incl. tip. Eggs Benedict $18, two eggs with ham $17, coffee $5.50 \u2013 seated at the Verandah. Lunch was slightly more and dinner was $100 (for two, with one or two drinks). We had one dinner at Wolfgang Pucks\u2019 LUPO which was much less, because they allow you to split the order. Given their generous portions, requesting half-orders makes sense for those watching their waistline. For those late night Big Mac attacks, there\u2019s a McDonalds across the street. Pool: gated, private access to another quiet oasis, tucked far away from the wave-surfing throngs at the Mandalay Bay pools. The cinnamon infused, frozen watermelon balls were awesome. Hint: arrive at the pool before 10:30am for the best lounge locations. Shopping: plenty of small shops located in the covered corridors connecting Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and the Excalibur. You never have to walk in the desert heat, unless you want to experience the Strip up close and personal. And your M Life players card works in those casinos as well.

At first we were a bit nervous about walking the dog around the hotel since everything is so high quality, but this hotel is very welcoming and accommodating to people AND animals! It was nice to be away from the typical Vegas crowd, but at the same time it was easy to access the entire casino and grounds of Mandalay Bay. Some reviewers have mentioned the \"poor\" location at the end of the Strip. While yes, this location is far from the center attraction of the Strip, we found that is was easier to access the airport, freeway, and we were glad to not have to drive through the Strip. The one drawback is the cell service (using AT&T iPhone) as it was extremely slow, but it was this way throughout the entire Mandalay property. So, it was not easy to use the Mandalay app. The hotel does offer internet access for $14.99/day, but we opted not to purchase. (To be honest, the hotel should be offering free Wi-Fi for the room rate they charge, but this is a typical Four Seasons charge). Food was excellent here, too. So scrumptious with excellent menu. Quick-tip: Happy Hour everyday from 4pm to 7pm - it does not disappoint!

The staff was better than other hotels, but not quite as intuitive or thoughtful as the FS Wailea. Only negative is how far down the strip it is and the CRAZY lack of cars they offer in a place like Vegas - ONE car for guests.

We have stayed at other 4S as we love the level of service, relaxation, and cleanliness of these resorts. so here is my review, and mind you, I am comparing this one to the others!!! First off, it is not a stand alone property as it occupies the top 5 floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel, so that was a little odd to me. When we booked this hotel, I requested a Fridge as my daughter has special dietary needs, a microwave, which they suggested, and told them we were celebrating her belated Birthday and our anniversary. When we checked in, there was no Refrigerator, the T.V. did not work, the microwave did not work, there were no robes for the children, no welcome treat for the children and the kid's Room service menu was missing. I called the appropriate dept.'s to start having these items fixed and it took forever to get the Fridge, to get the kid's menu, to get the robes etc. This was really disappointing to us, as these items should have all been checked to make sure they were in working order and there before we arrived. Aside from the bad start, the staff was all wonderful and very friendly, the pool service was great, concierge great, as well as valet. House car was never available at the time we requested but we did not expect it to be. We loved how quiet the hotel was and joked about going through the magic door from the Mandalay Bay back to the 4S, how it was like steeping into another world. We are non smokers and did not go on the trip to gamble but rather spend it with out children, so it was perfect for us!!! So, to sum it up, we are glad we stayed here and checked it out, but would probably not stay here again when we return to Vegas.

Instead, we had a very clean and spacious room with a partial view of the strip from which to all admire the twinkling lights from afar. The children's amenities were delightful and appreciated. The pool was warm and fun with great pool- side service for yummy meals, drinks and nice chats with friendly servers. We are so glad we chose FS Las Vegas. It is a peaceful comfortable space from which to admire the non-stop action of Vegas.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Place to combine Peace and Quiet with the Craziness of Vegas\u201d", "Author": "mulchmaster", "ReviewID": "UR114582349", "Content": "Look, anyone going to the Four Seasons Hotel with the \"Hard Rock\" party till you drop attitude will be dissappointed.

How could you get it so wrong? This hotel styles itself as an \"oasis of serentiy and tranquility\". Whoever wrote this blurb for this hotel (it can be found in their room material) has clearly never stayed in it. Seduced by the many positive reviews on this site, and impressed by the fact that this hotel was \"#1\" in Las Vegas, I booked two nights in a 'superior' room as an anniversary treat for my other half. It was meant to be an expensive but luxurious and relaxing end to our holiday in the U.S. First of all - the few 'pros' about this hotel. The rooms were clean. We received a warm welcome. The hotel is nice inside, as you'd expect. The pool area is small but attractive. The 'cons'? I don't know where to start. First of all we were given a room on the 39th floor. Small for a 'superior' room, considering the massive (and much cheaper) suite we'd come from in the Platinum. All seemed ok until night fell - turns out it is very very windy at night in Vegas, and the wind howls through the hotel and the stairwells, causing a high-pitched and relentless noise that even my trusty industrial-strength earplugs couldn't silence. (I don't just mean \"It was a bit windy\" - this noise has to be heard to be believed). 2.30am found me wandering down in my complimentary dressing gown to the lobby to speak to the front desk about the problem. The chap was apologetic and pleasant and offered to switch our rooms the next day. Sleep on night one - around two hours, broken sleep. Morning arrived - phoned the front desk to arrange to swap rooms - put on hold for a very long time, probably 5 or 6 minutes. I expected they were just busy with new arrivals. The phone was eventually answered by a frankly rude man, who when I asked if we could use the pool first before relocating, replied with the puzzling question \"To do what?\" Very bizarre. After going to the unwanted hassle of having to use precious holiday time to pack our bags up again to move, we went down to the front desk to get the new keys. Same rude man on the desk - arrogant, dismissive, and spoke all over what I was trying to say. I was standing with my partner and was very embarassed to be spoken to in this way. Bear in mind no complaint was made to this man - he was just changing the room. We were very polite to him, and I cannot understand his attitude. Really not what I would expect from the Four Seasons. This nasty experience really ruined the rest of the day for us (our anniversary!) and I was really upset. But never mind - we could look forward to a good night's sleep in our new room - right? Ha ha! No wind noise this time, but plenty of noise from the strip and McCarron airport just across the road. Sleep time - probably 4 hours. 2 hours better than the previous night! (Other cons for this hotel - it is very far away from the strip. It is walkable, but your feet will be very sore when you get back! Also - rudeness again from other hotel guests noted at the pool area. Seems that some of the Four Seasons clientele think as much of themselves as some of the front desk staff! Perhaps they are well-suited.) In the morning I was seething, at having had such a poor experience, and wasting all that money for nothing. In our two week holiday, we had spend nights in much cheaper hotels and had great experiences. The Assistant Manager had left a message on the room phone to ask how the new room was going - I phoned her and calmly explained the terrible time we'd had. She was very nice, and did apologise, but it was really a laugh and a shrug. Apparently it is 'always windy' in the hotel, even in the lobby. As we left she gave me her card and said \"When you decide to come back, phone me\". This was a nice gesture - but giddy with lack of sleep, and fuming at the money I'd wasted, I had to resist the urge to tear the card to confetti and shriek into the lobby \"Stay here AGAIN? Are you KIDDING?!\" So, we politely took the card and left as quickly as we could. An Oasis of Serenity? Absolutely not. I assume that like me, you work hard all year, and want to spend your hard earned pennies well. We had never been to Vegas before, and did not know any better.

The core Front Desk staff (and admin) would do well to retrain from any other Four Seasons property professionals. Other than this downwardly-cascading series of missteps, the remainder of our stay was on par with any other Four Seasons. Two Tourist Destination cities share equal levels of difficulty securing and training-to-an-exceptional-level hospitality professionals: Orlando and Las Vegas. Disney delivers a 4-5 Star experience across the stay at its upper-end properties, and at least 4-Star at all its others. Las Vegas hospitality--in spite of its heavily marketed imagery--rarely rises above 3 Stars, even at its most exclusive properties. The Four Seasons Las Vegas may not hire (or be able to source) the career--oriented-best, but it's certainly capable of training and reviewing these staff to a level that will not blunt or bruise its brand relationship with its lifelong clients. The fundamentals from the Ritz-Carlton culture would be the essential retraining point. To the property's credit, every other division team in the entire resort fully met, and even exceeded my expectation from this unparalleled collection of fine properties.

You can travel the length of the strip using the bus service which is right outside the hotel - this costs $7 per person for a 24 hour pass. There are two to choose from - Duce and Express. The Duce has many stops and can take a long time to cover a relatively short distance but is worthwhile if you are trying to get a feel of where everything is - Express has far fewer stops but is only a single deck bus which can often get full. Taxis are plentiful but as with most things are not cheap. You can use the monorail between the Mandalay hotel and Excallibur hotel for free but this only covers a short distance. On the strip you are hassled by people trying to sell you something - time shares / show tickets or prositutes! A tip is to tell them you are going home that day and they will then back off. Avoid the north end of Vegas as this is tacky and can be threatening with some unsavoury caracters knocking around. In truth we would probably not go back to Vegas again. Its great to see once.

Sunday night. Was upgraded to a view over the pool area. Rm 37118. B/c we had a 1 year old, they surprised us with a crib, a diaper basket/bin and a few diapers, which was really nice. They allowed us to check in ~ 12:30, which was nice as well. This was my wife's first FS experience and she was ecstatic. The past reviewers are correct. The Mandalay Bay is a typical casino. It is huge and the FS is just a relaxing reprieve. The MB elevators have 7 people in them and the FS elevators have your self and family. HUGE difference on so many levels. The FS provided my child with a sweets plate and we received an anniversary cake which was thoughtful and has been done often to other reviewers on TA. On our check in day, it was soo very windy that we stayed in one of the two secluded hot tubs outside. Unfortunately, we never received the sunglasses treatment or treats as previously reported. We were ignored, which was a bit upsetting to me since I was really looking forward to these treats and the typical FS service. The next morning we went to the pool section and my wife had her sun glasses cleaned. She was wow'd. I was not b/c I was hoping for what other received. In fact, it seemed that if you did not order any food, the staff rarely came by. Most of the staff at the pool were kids and did not seem to care very much in my opinion. I went swimming on the check in day and lost my card in the pool somewhere. At a FS hotel, I expect exceptional service. When I let them know at the pool, they coldly stated that I needed to go to the front desk. We were planning to check out the Mother's day brunch (we checked in on Mother's day). We arrived at Verandah at ~ 2:30 pm. They closed brunch at 4 pm. The four or five girls at the front desk (where you ask for a table) did not seem to even look up or notice when we arrived and then were overall not welcoming at all. They just wanted to talk among themselves about when they can shut down the buffet. Clearly did not want to be there. The buffet was $65/person and that would have been fine since it was Mother's Day and our anniversary night, but we said no thanks based on their attitudes and lack of even greeting us. My wife went in and looked at the food for a second. She said it looked great, but we decided not to pay the money for sub-standard service. Go to the SPA. It is complimentary (minus the massages/services) and offers a gym and sauna and showers, which are great!! This is a secluded hotel, which is great! As I am mentioning, though, it has some places to work on. We were really disappointed when we laid down in bed at night and our TV did not work. I thought, \"Are you serious??\" I screamed out loud I was so disappointed! I wanted a perfect experience, especially on our anniversary night and b/c it was a FS hotel and it was not perfect!! I called the front desk and let them know. They offered to move me or send up a technician. It was 9 pm or so when we called so we did not want to move. The tech needed ~ 5 minutes to diagnose the problem and fix it, but it just really disappointed me. My wife really enjoyed the hotel. I had higher standards. If I find my way to Vegas again, I will stay at the Bellagio. My wife loved the fountains and it is in the middle of the strip.

Because it is relatively small, the reception area is intimate and service is efficient, compared to the long lines in the major Strip hotels. The whole place is quiet and elegantly low-key, which is a nice sensory respite after a day in Las Vegas. Rooms are well decorated, well appointed and very, very comfortable (the beds and pillows are just fantastic). In room amenities are very good, and the coffee machine works, and produces great coffee, which is by no means usual in US hotels. The Service is efficient and friendly, with personal touches that make the difference. The whole place had a pleasant, quiet feeling to it. You really notice this when you go from the Mandalay Bay complex, through the keycard doors into the Four Seaons - the noise disappears, the decor is soft and you just relax instantly. Hell, even the carpets are soft. Outside, the pool area is small, but very well served - you are escorted to loungers and the waiting staff never let you go hungry or thirsty. There is some aircraft noise here, but with McCarran literally beside the strip, thats going to be an issue anywhere in the Casino area. Walking to MGM or Excalibur takes about 10 minutes, or you can take the tramway direct to Excalibur in 2-3 minutes. Overall, a great stay - all that stops this from getting a 5 star is the fact that it's not quite as accomplished as the other Four Seasons we've used in the past - but not far off it.

Because of the nature of the conference, I registered for the conference, booked the hotel room and my flight a good solid 2 months ahead of the event, logically to get the early bird registration rate and hopefully find a competitive price on airfare. My options for hotel bookings for this conference were the Mandalay Bay and THEhotel, on the Mandalay property. Either was fine with me, but I chose the lowest priced Mandalay Bay room available under the conference rate. I found a competitive price for airfare, but it had me arriving in Las Vegas at 11:30 at night the day before the main events of the conference. I generally like to arrive the Sunday afternoon before the conference starts to get my registration materials and to do the early arrival meet-and-greet, but it wasn\u2019t in the cards this time around. We arrived a little early in Las Vegas and since I was traveling carry-on I was able to get out of the airport by 11:30 and catch a shuttle that was immediately leaving for the hotel. After hitting what seemed like all the other hotels on the strip, we arrived at the Mandalay Bay. I found a very empty registration desk and an unoccupied desk agent. Our interaction was short and polite. I displayed my credentials and the agent asked if I\u2019d stayed there before, my response was no, I hadn\u2019t. At which the agents excused themselves for a moment and went into a back room. Less than a minute later they reappeared and announced that I had been upgraded to the Four Seasons. They pointed me toward a hallway and gave instructions to go to the circular stairs that were at the end of the rather long hallway and to check in with the Four Season\u2019s desk. After a few minutes walk I arrived at the Four Season\u2019s desk. The agent there greeted me as Mr. so-and-so (I\u2019m not honestly used to being greeted by my last name), traded unexpected by reasonable pleasantries; how my flight was if I was attending the conference, if I would have time to enjoy other parts of Vegas. All very nice, and seemingly genuine. I was offered a bottle of water and an apology was made because they had run out of fresh fruit for the day. This is the first time I\u2019ve stayed at a hotel and been offered complimentary water and fruit. As would be typical, I was asked if I needed any luggage assistance, but I declined because I had one bag with me and I\u2019ve never been one to use porter or luggage services at places I stay. I figure I have a few more years left in which I can handle my own luggage. I make my way to the elevators. It turns out that the Four Seasons occupies the 35th through the 39the floors of the Mandalay Bay tower. My room was on the 38th floor and looked down upon the pools and out toward the distant mountains that surround greater Las Vegas. The room was very elegant and nicely appointed. The furniture choices were some of the best I\u2019ve seen in a hotel in a long time. The obligatory lounge chair and ottoman were a welcome place to relax and read after a full day of meetings, slide shows and buzzwords. Most of the time I\u2019m usually disappointed in the comfort of the furnishings in hotels, however the chair and ottoman were something I would have liked to take home with me for my living room. The room was equipped with a nicely stocked mini-bar, however I never hit the hotel mini-bar because the prices are just ridiculous. I\u2019m not against paying for convenience, however a $4 can of Pringles (and it isn\u2019t even a full sized can) is beyond a convenience fee. The complimentary Keruig coffee maker was nice. This is the first time I\u2019ve stayed at a place where the in room coffee was provided using a real pod coffee maker. It was very good coffee, and the housekeeping staff noticed I was using all the k-cups provided during the day, so they double stocked me after my first day there (a very nice touch and very observant of them). This was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had with hotel housekeeping staff. They must have been visiting the room multiple times a day. After my morning ritual I\u2019d head down to the conference. During a break before lunch I\u2019d head back to the room, freshen up a little, have a cup of coffee, and relax before lunch. During this time I\u2019d usually use a hand towel after washing my hands. I\u2019d return to the room after the afternoon sessions but before dinner and the hand towel would have been replaced with a fresh one and my dirty coffee cup would have already been replaced. After dinner and evening entertainment I\u2019d return for the night and the bed would be turned down and pillows reconfigured. I guess this fully illustrates how little I know about luxury brand hotels, but I was amazed with how efficient and hidden the housekeeping service was. I couldn\u2019t have asked for better housekeeping service. I was impressed with some of the complimentary extra services. The newspaper always arrived early, in a blue-green bag hung on the door handle. No leaning out into the hallway to pick a paper off the floor. I used the shoeshine service the first night I arrived. That morning my shoes were also hung on my door and were polished very nicely. If I had felt so inclined I could have used a pair of slippers. I found two pairs of slippers in medium in sealed bags in one of the closets near the entry to the room. I\u2019ve never been a slipper person so I didn\u2019t partake. The bathrobes were very luxurious, thought. In general, the upgrade, which apparently occurred because the Mandalay Bay had been overbooked, was a very pleasant experience, frankly beyond my wildest dreams.

My friend's Iphone needed to be charged and they plugged it in at the concierge desk while we ate lunch. Verandah restaurant had yummy food and good service. Because I stayed at the Mandaly Bay before, I thought we'd want to hang out at the Mandalay pool. But, actually, the Mandalay pool area was overrun with people with tattoos and kids. Unless you got up early (i.e. before 10 am) to get a chair they were pretty much all taken (save some padded chairs that cost $75 to rent for the day). Thankfully, the Four Seasons pool was never crowded and had amenities beyond belief. When you check in with pool concierge they set you up with an absolutely delightful padded chair, towels and ice water. The excellent service does not stop there. Throughout the day we were offered complementary: frozen snickers, ice pops, watermelon infused with lemon and basil, passion fruit pearls, sunglass cleaning, frozen infused pineapple chunks and Evian spray. It was truly the best poolside service I have ever experienced. In addition, the food menu had lots of options and was excellent. Oh, they also have free newspapers (USA Today, Wall Street Journal and a local Vegas paper), SPF 15 lotion and aloe vera. The last thing I want to comment on is check out. We requested a late check out (we were taking the red eye back to NYC) and unfortunately it was unavailable due to lots of people checking in. However, the front desk offered us the opportunity to check our luggage and shower in the spa. So, we sat by the pool all day getting pampered and then went to the spa which offered: robes, razors, lockers, an eucalyptus steam room, hair dryers, etc., etc. It was truly amazing! The only negative thing I will say is that the location is a bit far away from Vegas's hot spots. There is a tram in the hotel that will get you a bit further down the strip but to get to the Cosmopolitan, where all the action is right now, it's a $20 cab ride (or 45 minute walk - even though you can see if from the room!).", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWeekend Get a way\u201d", "Author": "SunandSkiers", "ReviewID": "UR104470588", "Content": "The pros- Perfect place to stay.

The four seasons has its own reception area, away from Mandalay Bay, to which it is joined. The top 5 floors of Mandalay bay (35 - 39) are actually the Four Seasons. The room was very nice, clean and well appointed. The view down the strip was spectacular day or night. All the staff was very courteous and helpful. Our shower door had a leak around the bottom seal. One phone call to the front desk and a maintenance man was there within five minutes, and replaced the seal.

The pool area the Four Seasons is exclusive for the Four Season guests. Again, all the staff are very friendly and attentive. Mandalay Bay patrons are not allowed in this area but we are allowed in there pool area. And now to the gripes. They shut the pool area off at night which is understandable. The trouble is if you're walking back from the Mexican restaurant let's say, you can't get back into the Four Seasons unless you go through the Casino at Mandalay Bay. This probably wouldn't be a big deal for most people, but my wife is allergic to cigarette smoke and recently had throat surgery. This being said, I'd imagine most parents wouldn't want to take their kids through that kind of environment either. We voiced our concerns at the front desk and they were very apologetic.

This hotel is so unique from any other Vegas hotel in that it is hidden within the Mandalay Bay occupying its 35th to 39th floors but it has a separate entrance and lobby, a separate guest-only pool, a separate and beautiful spa and gym facility, and two restaurants. You get the best of both worlds - the serene and seclusive environment of FS and the busy vibe of MB. When you are in FS everything is so quiet, but once you walk through \u201cthe secret door\u201d to MB you have access to its casino, a variety of dining and entertainment options, plus all its five crowded pools - you get the picture. The room and the all-marble bathroom are very clean. The decor is good but can not be described as stylish. The pillow-top mattress is extremely comfortable and linens feel great and smooth. The ceiling-to-floor window allows a fantastic view of the Strip - the only thing is that the green tint makes everything look different (i suppose this has to do with the golden coating of MB). The bathtub and shower are separate and there is a separate room for toilet. We loved the L\u2019occitane AND (!!) Bvlgari toiletries. The bathroom is not as shining as newer hotels like the Trump if you would notice small details such as scratches on the bathtub and some peeling-off caulk, but generally it has been very well maintained. The service is the highlight of the hotel. Housekeeping was superb and cared about all details. On the first night the shower and bathtub did not drain properly, but they were fixed quickly after we reported it. We were not given the key to the minibar when checking in (why on earth do they want to have a key to the minibar at the first place?) and only found it out after we tried to get creamers in the morning; but they delivered both the key and extra creamers quickly. Another good thing is that FS is among the few hotels in Vegas that does not charge a mandatory resort fee. Well there is a catch: you pay for internet ($15) and valet parking ($19). The complimentary services include a house car that will drop you off within 3 miles radius (no pick-up though), overnight shoe shine, access to the spa facility (including the steam room) and the gym. We found out, as also suggested by other TA reviewers, that the house car is not really that useful during evenings due to high demand - we were told to wait 30 minutes and they got us a cab instead instantly (in those mega casino hotels there is always a line for cabs).", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cA luxurious retreat on The Strip\u201d", "Author": "TravelSneak", "ReviewID": "UR103096459", "Content": "The lobby, pool, and room were gorgeous.

Trouble is, we knew what everything had to live up to so we ended up giving in and staying at the wonderful Four Seasons again. We were booked in a one bedroom suite again but were presented with the opportunity to upgrade to a Sunrise/Sunset Suite for an absolute song - how could we turn it down? Suffice to say it was amazing. The suite is over 1500 square foot and unlike some corner suites, you actually benefit from all of the space so it felt much bigger. As well as the usual bedroom and bathroom there is an additional cloakroom, a huge living room with separate desk office space, and a wonderful separate kitchen area that can be closed off so that the staff can come in a stock up your ice, coffee machine etc whilst leaving us in peace. As before the suite was impeccably clean, the housekeeping very good and turndown a welcome touch after a heavy night on the tiles. One niggle is the change from a free bottle of water by the bedside with the turndown service, to a bottle of Smart water on each side which 'can be purchased for $5.00' - a bit tacky. We didn't drink it, it's just a shame that even the Four Seasons has resorted to that sort of money making tactic! The only thing that took the shine off this stay was the room service. We had a couple of breakfasts, a lunch and a dinner. The first breakfast was fine and both lunches were great but the dinner was quite disappointing, tough steak which didn't taste as it has in the past. The worst was the breakfast on out last morning. We ordered a continental breakfast and admittedly we misread the slightly misleading menu thinking we would be getting a small selection of pastries and toast alongside coffee & OJ. Nope, just got cold chewy toast! In fairness, when I complained we very quickly received replacement hot toast and selection of absolutely wonderful pastries! Note to self - always order the pastries! I would like to say that despite this, the wonderful little touches that the Four Seasons is famous for were very much in evidence. A complimentary birthday cake and cupcakes for my husband's birthday and on our last afternoon some strawberries and chocolate were delivered, compliments of the management, that always takes away any negativity. As always, all the staff were excellent from check in to valet and housekeeping to maintenance, we have never encountered anyone who is anything but friendly and helpful. We are due back here in the summer and I can't wait.

Occupying the top 5 floors of the Mandalay Bay at the far southern end of the strip your sure of a great view whether it be the mountains or the strip! The Four Seasons has it's own pool which is heaven, pool attendants see to your every need with complimentary iced water, towels, frozen fruit, ice lollies, cold face flannels and a constant bar and food service if you wish. If you want to use the more hectic Mandalay Bay pool you can, free of charge, this has a huge wave pool with sand beach, several smaller pools and even a lazy river where you can sit in rubber rings and float round at your leisure. Don't be put off by the hotel being at the end of the strip, it's so long it doesn't matter where you are, there is always going to be something far away! If I return to vegas, sorry, WHEN I return to Vegas I will definetely be returning to the Four Seasons. PS. Just booked again for this coming August aswell. Can't wait! Top Tip:\"Use the Vallet Parking when you arrive to get your bags out and not have to worry about parking $19 for 24 hours, then get your car later or the following day and put it in the covered Mandalay Bay parking (which keeps it cool) and is free of charge. Ensure you visit the Premium Outlets at the other end of the strip for some great holiday bargains on top brands!\"", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago/United States", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing and Lovely Hotel with Superb Service!\u201d", "Author": "dianbe773", "ReviewID": "UR96779432", "Content": "I recently celebrated my birthday with five of my friends for a weekend at the Four Seasons.

My friend said the Champagne Mud Wrap was incredible. We relaxed in the steam room before moving on to the rest of our day. We had tickets for Donny & Marie and I have to say, the show was fantastic. A lot of energy, laughter and fun. The Sunday Brunch at the Veranda restaurant at the hotel was lovely. The choices were tremendous and the fresh fruit and homemade mini donuts were delightful. The weather was a breezy 73 degrees so I wish I had known to book our table outside on the patio but did not think that would even be an option in February.

It is not open to guests of the Mandalay Bay, who can sometimes be seen walking by to that hotel's pool, and peering longing through the fence! Four Seasons guests, however, have full access to the Mandalay pool. At the pool, attendants will frequently come by with frozen fruit, popsicles, or an Evian spritz to cool you in the heat of the day as you lay on their comfy, double-toweled sun loungers. There is also gourmet food and fabulous drinks that can be ordered from the poolside menu.

Also the connection with the Mandalay Bay allowed us to use pool facilities even though the pool for Four Seasons was closed. The Spa and Fitness Centre were first class and were empty each time I used them. The Four Seasons offers tranquility away from the crazyiness of Vegas itself. One matter though that did upset me greatly. I know that Vegas has a lot of trouble with dishonest people and appreciate they have to take steps to ensure they are going to be paid. However I had prepaid my stay at this hotel and only left my debit card for incidentals. Even though I have a number of credit cards the exchange rate from robbing banks is always a rip off, so I use my American Bank Debit card. I have been using this for years and always have the \"transaction in progress\" marked on the account which secures the funds but does not take them as such. This has been a process I have had from Alaska in the North to Arizona in the South from hotels to rental cars and never has anyone taken advantage of this until now. The hotel has actually taken $750 from my bank account. This in my view is sharp practice and is well above the incidentals we have used since being here. This in my view calls into question honesty and integrity and leaves a very bad taste. When discussed with the hotel front desk and management a host of excuses was given but none that made sense, they even allege that this allows them to issue credits more quickly which is rubbish. The facts are simple they have taken the money in my view without permission and is sitting in their bank account and not mine.

Overall, this place was fantastic and the best place we have ever stayed in Vegas. It is calm and subdued inside (some might call it bland, but I think it is refreshing and relaxing after all the casinos, lights, and Vegas T&A). The strip view rooms are nice as the hotel is further down on the strip so you get to see all the lights from all the other hotels. I have seen some people complaining about the location in terms of the Strip. It didn\u2019t bother us as we knew ahead of time, but if you want quick access to the party scene and want all the glitz and lights of Vegas, then this probably would not be the hotel for you. I thought that the FS had the perfect balance. As soon as you walk into the FS you have leave the smoke and clanging of the casinos behind and are in a calm oasis. But you can still leave and go to party on the strip. The pool is heavenly. There is a bar and comfy lounge chairs. They will set you up with ice water and sippy cups. They come around with popscicles, cucumbers for the eyes, and sunglass cleaners \u2013 however, the frequency of all of this seems to be hit and miss. We spent three full days at the pool. The first day, nothing. The second day, we got the popsicles. And the third day they came by with everything. There is somewhat of a sun/shade migration in the pool area as the sun changes through the day and reflects off the windows of the neighboring hotels. If you, like the hubby and me, need to stay in the shade, sit on the far side of the pool in the morning, but eventually you won\u2019t be able to be right next to the pool as it is totally engulfed in sun. If you want a full tan after your vacay, you are at the right place. The food they served at the pool was consistently good. The frozen grapes are a refreshing and healthy poolside snack for a hot day. For the meals they set you up with a tray table that goes over your lap \u2013 heaven! We loved getting breakfast next to the pool in our bathing suit. The pina coladas were excellent and a must! My only complaint is that we found it hard to get the attention of the staff fat the pool for ordering. They seemed understaffed in the pool area. Sometimes we would get a menu and then have to wait for quite a while (like 30+ minutes) before someone would come by again to ask what we wanted to eat or drink. All guests get access to the spa locker room amenities. You can access it from the gym or through the separate spa entrance. In the women\u2019s spa area they have a steam room, large vanities with excellent lighting and various hair care products. The hubby reported that the men\u2019s spa area had a large flat screen TV always tuned into some manly sports show. The spa services are pretty pricey, but all spas on the strip seem to have a large price tag. The hubby and I got a couples massage, and I guess he found it so relaxing that he fell asleep during it. The FS has a town car that you can get to drive you around for free (tip the driver of course). But the staff seems to keep it on the down low; they will not volunteer the existence of the town car unless asked. FS guests get access to the Mandalay Bay pools as well (except I think you will still have to pay extra to get into the Mandalay Bay European Bathing (topless) pool area). Mandalay Bay has an extensive pool area \u2013 wave pool, lazy river, and more. It is a somewhat different scene. We liked the FS pool better. If you tell them you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary, they send a free cake to your room! After Vegas we went to the Grand Canyon. The concierge staff was extremely helpful with getting us directions to pickup the rental car and getting us on our way to the Grand Canyon.

It is located at one end of the strip but I loved it when the taxi brought us back because it was just so quiet and calm. Attentive staff and very chid friendly. When we checked in they asked our kiddies names as we requested a cot and when we arrived in our room we were welcomed to a beautifully made cot, m@m plates with the kids name in chocolate and lovely organic products for the kids in the bathrooms, as well as little sponges spelling out their names.. too cute! It was those touches that made it a nice stay... The view was a strip view and was good... the room in itself was standard but clean with comfortable beds. Disadvantages would be the room service for a glass milk was $12... I took the elevator to the Mandalay Bay store and bought it for $3! The walk to the room, but I have heard you get that with most Vegas hotels... All in all a great stay and a peaceful one.. no casinos to walk through to get to your room, quiet pool, nice breakfasts. All at a price but when you look at the other hotels and how rammed they are it was worth it... esp when you have an empty pool and you see people from Mandalay Bay peering in ;)", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cStay for the service and tranquility, but not the location\u201d", "Author": "Roamingtheworld", "ReviewID": "UR91417665", "Content": "We just got back from a stay at the Four Seasons, and would agree with all the other reviewers that the service level was way above what you might expect in other hotels. There was a very high staff-to-guest ratio, and every single employee we encountered always made eye contact and greeted us in a friendly way. The view in our premium strip-level room was very nice, and as this was my husband and my first trip to Vegas, we appreciated being able to take in both the town and surrounding mountains. Beds were very comfy, and the concierge very helpful. We rented a car for a day from the hotel and drove out to Red Rock Canyon--very worth it if you like unusual outdoor beauty, and want a chance to see the area. Fitness Center was excellent. Since the hotel is really the top four floors of the Mandalay Bay resort, the casino and restaurants there are available to you. We ate some good meals at the Border Grille and Wolfgang Puck's Lupo in Mandalay Bay. House of Blues was also fun. The only negative I can think of isn't a reflection on the hotel or its employees; rather, it is the out-of-the-way location to most of the \"action\" in Las Vegas. I loved the peace and quiet of the hotel, but it is about a 30 minute walk to get to the Bellagio or other center-strip locations if you are wanting entertainment or a meal out. My husband and I are runners, and obviously don't mind exercise, but if you are female and want to dress up, a 30 minute jaunt in heels is not my idea of fun. If you want to take a taxi, plan to spend about $40.00 round trip every time you want to go anywhere on the Strip, which is about 4 miles long. There is a tram you can take which runs behind the hotel zone, but it starts behind the MGM Grand, and can be confusing to reach. Also, if you are allergic to dogs, you should be aware that the hotel allows them. We have two large labs and like dogs, but we had to chuckle at all the \"yipe-yipes\" we encountered. Lots of little white pooches in sweaters with painted hair and, in some cases, toenails! OMG--if you remember the Howells from Gilligan's Island, or have seen Paris Hilton's companion, you get the general idea.

Great restaurants here and at Mandalay. Separate lobby is nice. Room service was also very good and rooms have what you need... except for two issues. 1) Most $500 a night rooms at other hotels have 2 sinks to allow both people to get ready at the same time. This hotel did not until you got up to specialty suites. You are always going out in Vegas, so having a bathroom built for ONE is a awkward. Second, our housekeeping was LOUD at 8AM in the hallway. NOT good for 8AM in Vegas. Loud in any language at 8AM is bad... and they used their radios too. Not very FOUR SEASONS like. Lastly, there is bit of noise from the nearby airport, depending on what side you room is on... not terrible, but mildly bothersome. Despite these comments, we probably would stay here again... if we wanted a mellow stay. For fun, THE Hotel at Mandalay are superior rooms and the Wynn caters to the Four Seasons money crowd. I feel the new Mandarin Oriental at CityCenter will top the Four Seasons SOON. As may Aria. Both look spectacular. Our next stay will be at the Mandarin Oriental to compare.

Second, on the final day of our stay, there was no hot water; my husband and I both got a cold shower. I did tell the front desk about the hot water problem and they explained that a boiler at Mandalay Bay had gone down and was currently being serviced by their engineers.

It is, as so many have said, an oasis of calm - although why anyone would go to Vegas to get 'calm' is questionable... It doesn't have its own casino, but from the casino of the Mandalay Bay you walk past the lifts, turn a corner and find a discreet single door that opens with your Four Seasons keycard. The silence and peace overwhelms after the casino mayhem and the express lift zooms straight up to floors 36 - 39, away from it all with a view over Vegas and the desert. Our room was spacious, clean, and had a huge comfortable bed - the turn down service was a little odd though. Every evening we'd come back to a nicely turned down bed, with little towelling mats to rest you weary feet on by each side of the bed and... the radio turned on. Why? I mean, if I wanted the radio on, I'd turn it on. And if I did, I wouldn't leave it on while I was out. The bathroom was rather large too, with the deepest bath I've ever seen, a vast mirror and L'Occitane toiletries ( a nice touch). And the obligatory phone in the loo. I mean, please, has anyone ever answered the phone while on the loo and carried on a conversation? Honestly... The entire outside wall was a floor to ceiling window, tinted gold which looks great from outside but cast the room and everything and everyone in it with a deathly jaundiced pallor. Wi-fi is available but at an alarming $14.99 a day. This is frankly an outrage when even budget hotels and any coffe shop you care to wander in to has it for free. We also had the oddest experience with the air con. We spent ages tracking down a weird howling, like a coyote falling down a lift shaft, which eventually turned out to be a fight between the wind outside (being on floor 39) and the corridor air-con meeting through the gap under our door. We had to stuff the bottom of the door with a towel to stop it keeping us awake at night. Very odd. Overall, however, we loved the Four Seasons. The room, service, staff all excellent.

It was quiet, luxurious, just perfect for relaxation. You can use free tram that drives you to Excalibur hotel \u2013 very convenient to get closer to the \u201ecentre\u201c. The hotel itself: to start with, this is probably the only hotel in LV that does not have casino on the ground floor. We are no fans of gambling, but I said to myself: OK, in Vegas I will try it. After walking into casino in one of the hotels we were so shocked from all the noise and cacophony that we literally run away... So, even after staying in Vegas, we remained gambling virgins :-) ... So, if your main purpose for visiting Vegas is not gambling, this is the right hotel for you. Amenities: you can use pools belonging to Mandalay Bay \u2013 there are several of them. We enjoyed the pool with artificial waves \u2013 a lot of fun. When you prefer quiet stay at the pool, stay at the pool belonging to Four Seasons. Perfect service, great drinks and food, not crowded at all. The pool was nice, the only downside was that the water was so warm that you did not feel a lot of refreshment. To be fair \u2013 the air temperature was over 45 C and one can understand that it might be quite a challenge to keep the water colder... Other: we took a trip to Grand Canyon West Rim \u2013 flying there from LV by a small plane, then by helicopter down to Colorado river, some 20mins by boat and back by helicopter to SkyWalk and Eagle\u2019s point and back by plane to LV. WOW, what an experience! When seeing the Grand Canyon from the plane for the first time, while listenning to Armstrong\u2019s \u201eWhat a wonderful world\u201c, we had tears in our eyes....

We had a room overlooking the strip--marvelous view! I had a spa appointment the first morning . What a treat! I had the best massage of my life! And I love my massages so I am pretty picky. Bonnie was the best! The spa was wonderful and you are able to access it even if you don't have a treatment. The steam shower was heavenly and the showers were luxurious! I even went down the following morning just to sit in the steam shower and take my shower down in the spa!! Next...the pool! It was the most incredible experience! My husband, who does not like to sit for very long, found himself enjoying the pool so much that we didn't move all day. Every 30 minutes they would bring around frozen fruit, popsicles, cucumbers for your eyes, they would clean your sunglasses, aloe vera toward the end of the day for any sunburns, and ice, cold water pitchers all day long. Beers came in an ice bucket. The food was amazing and they bring you your food on a bed tray. Ahhhhhhh...it was definitely the most spoiled I have ever been. And to make things even better, you could stay at this hotel and never hear the \"sounds of Vegas\". (No slots dinging) It was the perfect setup because if you did want to have the crazy night life of Vegas it was right there. Also, if you wanted to use the Mandalay Bay pool you were able to.

When you\u2019re paying USD$350+ per night, internet should be complimentary. Courtesy car. We were unable to use this service because your child needs to be aged over 6 or weigh more than 60 pounds. Four Seasons pool. It is unsuitable for young children with deep edges and steps (eg. No sloping entry). The Mandalay pools are also hard work for families with young children. Most of the pools are like the Four Seasons pool (deep and steep edges). The only pool that\u2019s not is the wave pool zone and young kids aren\u2019t allowed in the height restricted main wave pool. Toddlers are restricted to an area of the wave pool away from the wave area that has an arbitrary blue line that you have to keep inside of. It was hard work explaining to our toddler why they couldn\u2019t go beyond this arbitrary blue line, especially when we\u2019re used to waves back home at Australian beaches. Last but not least, there is no shade over the pools. In summary, we thought we would be able to let our little man wander and splash around supervised by us, but with some latitude as to what he could and couldn\u2019t do. In reality, we had to be hyper vigilant because the pools were all deep, the pool that wasn\u2019t deep he wasn\u2019t allowed in 90% of it and we had to watch the dreaded blue line and we always had to be vigilant about sun burn because there was no shade \u2013 not the relaxing pool holiday we envisaged. Location. We love walking and thought the Four Season\u2019s out of the way location would be ok, but with a youngster in tow, we really underestimated the location. For starters, getting out of the Four Seasons takes about 10 minutes due to long corridors and a big lobby area. Walking to the tram and getting to New York, New York took approx 20 minutes. If you wanted to walk to, say, the Bellagio, you\u2019d be looking at an hour walk one way. The reason for this is that along the Strip, you can\u2019t walk down the strip in a straight line crossing at traffic lights. To minimise pedestrian accidents, all major thoroughfares have pedestrian bridges that mean a simple 1 minute crossing becomes a 5-10 minute crossing. It\u2019s a long way with a tired toddler. In hindsight, we wish we had investigated the bus situation earlier. For $7, you get a 24 hour pass for the gold buses that go up and down the strip every 12 minutes or so.

We stayed for 14 nights in a one bedroom suite and from driving up to the entrance to checking out (very sadly) it was outstanding. The room was light and airy and impeccably clean. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the sheets soft and luxurious. We've stayed in more expensive suites in Vegas before and had scratchy sheets on beds made by maids who don't seem to see the benefit of covering the entire mattress - none of that here! I love the little touches, the fact that room service give you a time and stick to it, the fact that a light went out in the shower and before I could report it, it was fixed because the maids pay real attention. Normally we put the do not disturb on once our room has been done wherever we are but not here. We loved the turndown service and the refreshing of the towels and turning on the TV to the soothing channel - very nice. The cost of the food was very reasonable bearing in mind the place we were staying and the quality was always top notch. We asked for a late checkout and got it without query despite the fact that we were leaving on a busy weekend. The pool is as everyone says here and in my opinion crowns the whole experience. Even on Labour Day weekend when it was busy you felt completely like an individual. The frozen melon balls, spritzing and sunglass cleaning just make you feel like you are at a special place added to the fact that the staff remember you. You tell them you have a hangover and they treat you accordingly - always a bonus! The menu by the pool is great too and because of the way they serve you on trays it feels as natural as eating in the Verandah restaurant. I would highly recommend the foot massage by the pool - well worth it. As everyone says the secret door to the Mandalay is a fabulous touch and you can feel the looks from other people as you go through it as you do when the masses are going to the Beach looking through the gates and we're lazing by an exclusive pool. Personally I don't feel that the Four Seasons is out of the way but we always stay at this end of the strip, when we stayed at the Venetian it felt a little weird, and it wasn't very good!

Unfortunately, our stay did not match our expectations due to low levels of service/quality of room. On the plus side, the hotel does match up to other FS hotels/5 star hotels in respect of ambience/lobby furnishings/pool/restaurant etc. I agree with previous reviewers comments on the tranquility of the pool area/relaxed oasis compared to the Mandalay Bay pool areas; although the MB wave pool/lazy river are good fun. The access to MB casino is good (although some people perhaps get too carried away with the private entrance). The quality of the food was also good. Our issue was with the service or lack of it. We had booked the hotel via a FS preferred partner & this included a room upgrade (if available); breakfast credit, spa credit. Prior to check in, FS had requested the names of my children. I had hoped that this would lead to cookies with my kids names on or a small gift with names on (as per some other 5 star hotels that we stayed at during our trip). No such luck, my kids received a packet of anonymous pop corn. On check-in, we were told that we had been given an upgraded room. Unfortunately, when we reached our room we only had an excellent view of R15, I realised that we had not been upgraded. When I called the front desk, I was told that we hadn't been upgraded and there was no opportunity to upgrade as the hotel was full (even though I was willing to pay for an upgrade). Not a big issue in itself as there was no guaranteed upgrade but not so great when you're told by check-in desk that you have been upgraded. Then on one of our visits to the pool, the poolside staff brought some towels to our chairs but no seat covers. No big issue as we went into the pool. Then my wife got out of the pool & waited for someone to bring her a seat cover. After 5 mins, I got out of the pool & asked someone to bring over some seat covers & got back into the pool. After another 10 mins of being ignored & comments from my wife, I had to get out of the pool & go over to ask again for the seat covers. Eventually they came with an apology 15 mins later from whoever was in charge of the poolside service. Again not a major issue but hardly the \"cleaning your sun glasses\" first class platinum poolside service that other guest rave on about. We had the same issue on another trip to the pool but I'd learned my lesson from the previous day & went directly over to the towel service to fetch them myself! I don't expect staff to grovel & bow as soon as my family arrive at the pool but some level of consistent service would have been good. I noticed some family's received the royal service: maybe I should have brought more $ to poolside. The AC in the room was very poor. The bell boy agreed & said that he could obtain a fan from housekeeping to keep the room cooler: so there was some quality service from someone at FS LV. When the temperature is 100F+ & the A/C claims to be at 60F but is in reality at 80F, it sums up a hotel that thinks its number one in LV for service and quality but the reality is alot different. On check out, we were overcharged for breakfast despite our credit. I wasn't even given the full breakfast credit as noted in my confirmation but by this stage I couldn't be bothered to question the point. I left the hotel disappointed with at least the thought that I wouldn't need to waste $$$ to be at the wrong end of the Strip again + the hope that MO hotel might live up to its hype!

Everything was as it was on our last visit, lovely furnishings, nice bathrobes and L'occitane products. A plate of strawberries with dipping chocolate was waiting for us on the table with another handwritten letter from the manager welcoming us back to the Four Seasons. The facilities of the pool are amazing, the staff so helpful and eager to please. I just loved walking through the corridors of this wonderful hotel with its eucalyptus scent coming from the spa, luxurious decor and the subtle classiness and elegance. The little touches make this hotel special. We were jetlagged on our first morning, waking around 4am, I went down to the pool area to look around and the night manager was there. He asked me about our trip and where we were from and told me that it was particularly hot at this time and to be safe in the sun. He said if there was anything we needed, not to hesitate to ask and they would accommodate us. Very friendly and kind. There was also complimentary tea/coffee and pastries (amazing) in the lobby each morning for guests to enjoy along with newspapers. Unfortunately, we had to leave early due to a family illness. Concierge were fantastic in assisting us to get a flight back to the UK that same night. I was quite upset whilst my husband was sorting our flight out and the concierge came over with bottles of water for me and my husband I feel that I had to mention the little details in this review to give readers an idea of the quality service of this hotel.

Before booking, I wrote mail to hotel to ask if the was any music playing by the pool. I was answered that no music was playing near the pool. This was exactly what I was looking for. Big disappointment when I arrived: there was pop music playing all around the pool. Certainly, the volume was less loud that the next door hotel, but I was given false information. I told the reception that it was too bad that this hotel, not supposed to be like all the others in Vegas (it has no casino...) would gain on keeping the pool as a quiet zone. The second remark is about the laundry. I gave my long sleeve shirt to laundry to wash. It had the left arm cufflink that was missing. When I received my shirt back the next morning, they had sewn a new cufflink on the shirt with no extra charge. I was pleasantly surprised. By the way, they have wireless internet...at your charge (just a 24H formula, not even possible to subscribe for one hour).

For example: parking....you either park in a large structure and hike in, or you valet and wait 20 minutes for your car. Front desk: a line. Pool: large and good for large groups. you get the idea...large and impersonal. The Four Seasons is a stark contrast to these mega resorts. It's like a small hotel that happens to be within the Mandalay Bay, thus offering the best of both worlds. The Four Seasons offers great service...your car is brought up right away, the staff knows your name, there is service by the pool (although not quite up to par with other Four Seasons), the rooms are very comfortable with great beds, towels, bath products, etc. Because it is high up in the Mandalay, all rooms have nice views. If you feel like gambling, you go to the Mandalay. If you don't want it, it's not in your face. The Four Seasons is a great hotel. I don't think it measures up to many of the chains other hotels, but it is great for Vegas standards, a place where service is non-existent. My only gripe, as with many hotels, is that they charge for internet. I have never understood why lower end hotels, such as Holiday Inns, give free internet, but the expensive properties do not.

The rooms are very nice (my wife appreciated the very high end shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion by L'Occitaine) but certainly not the reason to stay here. The pool is a very short walk from the elevators instead of the usual trek you have to make for the larger hotels. They set up a chair for you with towels and a pitcher of ice water. The attendants were handing out free popcicles for everyone at the pool and also came by with fruit slices and spritzes of Evian. All the amenities of the Mandalay are available and are just out the door from the elevator only accessible to Four Seasons guests.

The position of this hotel at the edge of the strip means that it is just near enough the action to be convenient (there is a regular monorail if you don't fancy the 10 min walk to main strip) but far enough away to be peaceful and a welcome break from the madness. The rooms, although possibly not as flashy as some other hotels, are spotless (beds are sooooo comfortable) and the strip view rooms have amazing views over Vegas. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff very attentive to all your needs, with excellent personal service and attention to detail. The restaurant staff in particular were really helpful in planning my reception, which was a really lovely evening. The pool area is excellent and was never too crowded on weekdays. I loved the little touches such as free popsicles and evian spritzes. What was great is that we could use the Manadalay Bay pool (which was bigger and busier, with a wave machine etc) but the Mandalay guests weren't allowed to use ours (one day we saw some Mandalay guests looking through the gate at our pool with longing looks). The Four Seasons pool was a little slice of tranquility that I really enjoyed (except on the weekend when it did get a little crowded, although we still managed to get beds easily enough). The whole experience of staying at the Four Seasons felt very special and exclusive - especially when you walked the main strip and saw guests from other hotels lugging their cases through the main casinos to get to their rooms. With the Seasons being a non-gaming hotel, there was none of that nonsense. We also noticed that the other hotel lobbys (being casinos) were full of sales people stopping you and trying to give you free stuff if you look at timeshares etc - this sort of carry on was noticeably absent at the non-gaming Four Seasons, and it was always a relief to have a haven away from all of the madness, where customer service didn't depend upon how much you were gambling or whether you wanted to buy property or not! For those who want to be close to a casino, however, the Four Seasons is still handy for the Mandalay Bay casino, which is accessed via the main lobby lift and a strange little unmarked connecting door (again, we could get into the Mandalay to use their facilities but the Mandalay guests couldn't get into the Four Seasons, so it never got too crowded).

Nightly turndown service and cleanliness...perfect. We enjoyed the Verandah Restaurant for breakfast each day with a larger-than-expected continental breakfast.

We were warned during check in about the rock concert to be held on Saturday night. We were told we might be aware of it but possibly not. During the summer, every Saturday an outdoor rock concert blasts from the Mandalay Bay pool area from 9pm to midnight. Our south facing 37th floor room pulsated to the booming bass of Ziggy Marley and his reggae group. We were not able to get any sleep till the show ended. (this was the day we arrived, and as we are from the eastern time zone we finally were allowed to sleep at 3 am, our time) Standing next to my Harley Davidson Road King at full throttle in an enclosed garage is less bassy than Ziggy Marley 37 floors below. We were surprised that the temperature in our air conditioned room the first night was 80 degrees F. The day we arrived the outside air temperature was 115 degrees F. The thermostat in our room was set at 60 degrees F, the lowest it could go. The hotel was not able to find us a quieter or cooler room the first night of our stay, the hotel was full. Fortunately the temperature dropped by a few derees for the balance of our say and we kept our curtains closed. By the end of our stay the night time temperature in our room was 73 degrees F. There were many positives to staying at this hotel. The most guests I ever saw at the front desk was 2, by comparison the Wynn and Bellagio had hundreds when I visited them. The concierge service was first rate helping get choice show seats, restaurant reservations, helicopter tour seats, handling my car rental and arranging the return of my lost video camers from a restaurant at the MGM Grand were I had mistakingly left it (perhaps due to sleep deprivation the first night.) The secretive access to the Mandalay Bay was an enjoyable diversion. But the difference between the Four seasons and Mandalay Bay (by going through the door) was the closest I would like to come to shizophrenia. The valet parking service was first rate and provided cold bottled water to all car occupants. The pool was great and the service at the pool was great, they even provide free sunscreen. However the \"free\" cold snacks, sunglass cleaning and evian spritzing were spotty. I only received one of each during the 10 hours or so I spent pool side during my 3 visits to the pool.

Having observed other hotel receptions whilst we were in Las Vegas what I can say is that there was never a queue to check in or check out or for the elevators - which is something we saw at most other hotels we visited. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but they took our mobile (even though its a UK one) and called and texted as soon as it was. We had booked a Strip View King and got what we booked. The room was, as others have commented, a regular sized room - nothing ostentatious. It had plenty of storage space and the bathroom was reasonably spacious with an excellent shower. I was surprised that internet access was not included in the room rate. We were perfectly aware of the location of the hotel - that it is at the end of the strip and this didn't really cause us any problems. We started off by using the tram link to the Luxor and Exalibur and then walking to the tram that links the rest of the strip - but it was so hot when we were there - 113 degrees that I just couldn't handle the heat at the stations and after that we used taxis to get around which weren't as expensive as I had feared (but then I'm used to the price of London taxis). Talking of the heat, the one complaint I have about our room was that the air conditioning just couldn't keep the room to temperature - it never got cold enough. We reported it to reception and they sent someone up while we were out but I can't say that it made any difference. However we did notice that a lot of public areas in several of the hotels were quite warm - so I think it was to do with the extreme heat at the time. It was my birthday during this trip and the hotel sent up a very delicious cake which was a nice touch. The best thing about the hotel for us was that it was so quiet and calm - you could have the noise and bustle of Vegas just by walking through the door to the Mandalay Bay - but then escape back to tranquility when you wanted to. I know this wouldn't suit a lot of people but it was just right for us. We got a reasonable rate as we booked the 3 for 2 nights deal.

The private lobby area and elevator allows you to forget that you are connected to a mega resort, but the Mandalay facilities are there when you want them.

We do like to have have fun in Vegas going to nightclubs, etc and were a little worried that Four Seasons would be boring. Much to our surprise, Four Seasons was perfect! It was the perfect get away from the constant craziness of Vegas and allowed us to recharge each day before we went out. The highlights were: *The pool! There is nowhere else I will stay in Vegas during pool season. Pool was laid back with excellent service including free smoothies, iced water, evian misters, and foot massages for a fee. It wasn't overcrowded and shady areas were easy to find if needed. No need to pay an arm and a leg for a cabana. Best of all, YOU CAN USE THE POOL 24 HOURS A DAY. This is unheard of in Vegas. You also have access to Mandalay Bay's amazing pool complex and their european pool. *The Service. People were very attentive and knowledgeable. This is hard to find in Vegas due to the size of the hotels. Maid Service kept the room spotless and there is not a better feeling than coming back at night with soothing music on in your room and bottled water waiting by the bed. *The fitness center/spa. There is not an extra charge for this. The equipment is top notch and is in a convenient area close to the pool. The reason I only gave this hotel 4 stars in because 5 stars is only reserved for perfection. If the Four Seasons had rooms like the Palazzo or Encore, this would be 5 stars. The rooms are nice (the bed is amazing), but not up to what other high end Vegas hotels bring to the table. Also, they charge $19 a day for valet parking. This may be the only place in Vegas that charges for Valet. Not a big deal since you can use the free valet at The Hotel or Mandalay Bay as we did. I would recommend The Hotel valet since it is much quicker and better service than Mandalay. Another thing to add is that I was surprised how noisy the hotel got from the nightclub in the weekend. We could hear the music from the Foundation Room nightclub (on top of Mandalay) at 3am in the morning on Sunday. Didn't bother me, but I could see how it could bother others.

We don't gamble - perhaps a flutter here and there, and we don't do pool party atmospheres, so this was perfect. The hotel is like a hidden building within the grounds of the Uber-Busy Mandalay, where the only time you realised you were in company with other guests was by the pool. Granted, the pool area is smaller than most, but it was well maintained with the most efficient staff and service. It was only busy over Memorial weekend (which we hadn't accounted for when booking, but it made for great young-people watching of a night-time), and guests soon filtered off as the temperatures soared. Our daughter is used to upmarket quieter hotels, and did not find anything at fault here either. In fact, the staff were lovely to her and she loved the pool with the constant free smoothies/frozen grapes/iced towels/iced water/floats/lollies etc... This was our first time in Vegas and my partner (who was very concerned about my choice of hotel) agreed that the Four Seasons was perfect. Our strip view room was spacious (slightly dated but we got an I Pod docking alarm clock which is more than you get in some brand new hotels around the world) and with a great mini-bar. Bed was soooo soft and we slept like babies. Room service was prompt and very generous - American sized portions are always welcomed! As for the location: Get a taxi. They know when to jump on and off the strip, and yeah, you'll get stuck in traffic, but we got some great video footage and its much nicer to arrive in an airconditioned taxi for your dinner reservations than hot and sweaty after enduring the heat and crowds. Reccommended restaurants: Picasso's in Bellagio (haute cuisine and very accommodating, right on fountains), MOzen in Mandarin Oriental (Yum! Think all things Asian), Mon Gabi in Paris (just for the outside dining, food not excellent), \"Top of the World\" at Stratosphere (again, do it for the views and for the sights of people jumping off the floor above you! Been around for ages and blatantly needs updating), Tao's in The Venetian (nice food, clubby atmosphere) and Olives at the Bellagio (great fountain views, simple but tasty menu). Mandalay Bay was busy, and we feel that if you like the Four Seasons, then the pool area over there may feel like a mob scene. The shopping here is nowhere near as plentiful or high-end as other hotels.

They do have everything you would expect from a luxury hotel (fabulous bath products, super mattresses, high thread count sheets, bathrobes, etc.) However, the defining factor of this hotel is service. From the doorman, to your waiter, everyone at this hotel seems to be on a mission to make you as comfortable and happy as possible. The Mandalay Bay is easily accessible and had all the action we could handle. We used the spa at Mandalay Bay, which was heavenly as well as took in some nightlife there. The Mandalay Bay was a great spot for heavy duty fun, but it was sooooo relaxing to go back into the Four Seasons when we were done. The heart of the strip is a bit of a walk, but we certainly didn't feel unsafe when we walked it as one reviewer commented (and we were two women). One night at 10 pm we actually walked all the way from the Venetian. It was a bit of a hike but we were just enjoying the whole spectacle of Las Vegas. This hotel has spoiled me for all others!!!

After reading all of the reviews of this being the #1 Vegas rated hotel we decided to give it a try after trying the Bellagio last year. What a disappointment! Lets be honest- if you want peace and quiet and all of the other reasons people give this hotel such great reviews maybe you shouldn't be in Vegas. I like to hit the tables early in the AM or late in the PM when the wife is sleeping or mid-day when the wife is shopping. Last stay at Bellagio was perfect for this- and guess what the room was quiet which is supposedly the allure of this hotel. This hotel is actually the top 5 floors of Mandalay Bay. Thus you use the Mandalay Bay casino. Here's the kicker- if you want to gamble forget it. The casino knows they absolutely have you. Vegas 6 months ago at Bellagio (and even on this trip) - too numerous to count $10 tables (and even $5) for Blackjack if you just want to chill and not get robbed- why because it is center strip and has to compete. This casino at 6am- only 6 blackjack tables open and only had one full daily am $15 dollar blackjack table (serving 2 hotels- 4 seasons and mandalay) and the rest were $25 or $50 per hand. They are making money on you creatively thru the casino- I know - that's what Vegas does- but it is not like that at the other casinos at the off hours or mid day. I want to relax, be mindless and play $10 buck blackjack or pai gow- there was no opportunity for such at this casino. This hotel is at the absolute far end of the strip- horrible location and not safe feeling to walk to at night. Means $15 cab ride (each way) just to get to center of strip- thus mid-day shopping/ seeing sites and a separate late night show and you've just added $60 to your stay daily- no biggie but it does add up so be aware of such. No romantic leisurely strolls along the strip back to your hotel after a show or dinner. You'd need your sneakers, a police escort and a flashlight. The lobby is about a 1/8th mile walk to the elevators, the pool is undersized, it has zippo shopping, you can't use your room charge for the shops at the Mandalay Bay (only for food) you are right across the street from the airport and hear the helicopters or planes go bye starting at 6am. The rooms are undersized (Bellagio regular lakeview was @ 1.5 x size and had automatic curtains and music playing to fountain show for same price). Rooms are small and starting to look worn as is the trim work in the lobby. The stripview (if you regrettably do go here make sure to ask for the 100 wing) means you look down the road a mile away at the other hotels and it makes you actually want to be in Vegas- even though you are there- but oh so far, far away. Do yourself a favor- Bellagio , Palazzo, or the Wynn. All are walking distance to all shopping and shows, have the extravagance that reminds you why you are in Vegas and not somewhere sedate, you'll sleep on a quiet floor, and all have to compete with each other to have reasonable gaming tables. Pass on this one you won't regret it. For the Four Seasons experience do it in any other city. This particular Vegas hotel is grossly overrated.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "walnut creek, ca", "Title": "\u201cSo nice\u201d", "Author": "nickied", "ReviewID": "UR63452723", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights- had the third night free from a promo on their website and it was the best value of any of the five star hotels.

Room was quite large with two beds and chair and desk. Bathroom had separate soaking tub, but only one sink. Typical FS bathroom. Had a refrigerator that had space for my own waters. also a free coffee maker was nice. The spa was small but very private and quiet. the workout facilities and spa faciltities were free for all guests and well worth it- the workout room has many cardio machines and a well equipped weight area with machien and free weights. all with headsets and water and towels. The pool area was so nice. They set up your chairs for you with towels and water picther and glasses. the food was prompt and well worth the money. ordered off the kids menu due to large portions. decent pour size of the wines. Pool was heated and the two smaller jacuzzis were nice. quiet even though next to the mandalay beach, which is free to all FS guests as well and worth at least one visit, though so loud and busy. did not eat at Chrles Palmer, but looked very nice. Best part was that the noise and hustle of the mandalay bay was just a doorway away from the FS. starbucks and other cheaper paces ot eat available. LOVED Stripsteak and RM seafood at mandalay place was SOOOO GREAT! best veggie pasta I have ever had and the sushi was better than NOBU. Border grill was just ok. good margaritas.

So in that way the Four Seasons was perfect. We knew that every night we would come home to peace and quiet and be sheltered from some of the chaos. The style of the hotel was like most Four Seasons. It was very nice. Very clean. Very quiet. Our room had a nice view looking North toward the heart of the Strip. The grounds were beautiful. The public spaces were very nice as well. The staff were very professional and courteous. There was not a single glitch in our stay. We ate at Verandah for our first breakfast upon our Thursday morning arrival and also for brunch on Sunday. Both meals were wonderful. Two things to remember: 1) This hotel is at the VERY South end of the Strip and is a bit of a haul from everything. So if you stay here you are going to spend some time in and money on taxi services. On only one occasion were taxis not readily available at the hotel. Its about $15-20 for every ride to the central and north strip so it does add up. On occasion we wondered if we were to come back if we would try a hotel that is more centrally located. 2) This hotel actually takes up the top floors of the Mandalay Bay. Its not a big deal, as all of the entrances, elevators, grounds, pools etc are private. But, the way things are set up, it is a bit of a longer walk from the lobby to the elevators. Probably 75 yards? Just a hassle if you get to the front of the hotel and you realize you left something in the room. Overall, we had a great stay.

I was expecting more being this is the top rated hotel in a town where hospitality is king. First, the positives. The common areas are luxurious and nicely decorated. The Verandah martini happy hour was excellent. The spa/fitness facility is very well attended to by the employees who are helpful withoug being intrusive. The rooms have very nice bathrooms. I had been in contact with Yuki, one of the conceierges, before my trip. I mentioned we were celebrating a birthday and she had a cake sent up 5 minutes after we arrived. It was delicious and very thoughtful on her part. As has been mentioned in many reviews, this hotel really excels as a respite in the midst of the Las Vegas madness. That was its best feature, I thought. It was close enough to Mandaly Bay where you have everything you could want on a vacation. I am not a meat eater but was surprised how busy the on-site steak house was. It must be great. The beds are nice and the hotel very quiet. The employees were helpful overall but with a few the Las Vegas attitude comes out (no surprise I guess). The breakfast at the Verandah is way overpriced for what you get. We went there once and didn't go back. The spa and workout room are nice but I am a fitness fanatic and thought the exercise room could be a bit better. My partner had a massage and it was nice but overpriced. We were not offered an upgrade at check-in despite the hotel being relatively empty. My partner speaks spanish and had a conversation with one of the housekeepers where she was complaining about a certian class of guests and I thought that was inappropriate (on both of their parts). The location is far south of all the action in the central strip. Cabs are expensive. I found the rooms a bit small but that could be due to the oversized and luxurious bathrooms. If one wants to walk out of the hotel at the street level to go to the stores across the street you have to walk in the driveway. It is also an area that is not kept up very well with trash, etc. The pool was closed. We knew that going in but is it really necessary to close from Nov to March? Overall I liked the hotel but if it had a different name, like Hyatt or Marriott, I wouldn't have known the difference (Yuki's thoughtfulness aside).

(It must be the recession, but they are offering some pretty decent rates for a 4 star hotel). I could not find any significant negatives about this hotel, and I am usually pretty picky. The service is among the best I have ever experienced at any hotel. Everyone from the valet to the doorman to the check in staff were exceptionally well-trained, polite and helpful. This hotel has its act together. The common interior area is typical of a Four Seasons -- which is to say, elegantly but casually decorated to give a peaceful aura. The room on the 36th floor was very clean and decently sized. The bed was very comfortable. Nice floor to ceiling windows and my room had a view of the mountains and part of the airport. The spray starch next to the ironing board and the free overnight shoe shine are nice touches and similar to what hotels do in Manhattan. The car valet service was also quick. Each time I picked up my car I was asked if I needed assistance or directions anywhere by the concierge. The internet charge is $15 per day; I hooked up to the ethernet cable service and it was fast and stayed on the entire time. Everywhere you turn they try to give you complimentary bottled water. At checkout, in your room, and even when they pull up your car at the valet there are two bottles waiting for you in your car. Only two items I would point out, neither of which outweigh the positive aspects of this hotel: The bed linens had a very slight but noticeable odor that is difficult to describe. Something akin to chlorine or scented bleach, but not exactly. It wasn't overwhelming but noticeable. Also, unfortunately the pool is \"closed for seasonal maintenance\" during February. You have access to the Mandalay Bay pool, but winter in Las Vegas is actually a pretty good time to spend time by the pool. Overall, this is a top notch hotel. I felt well-rested when I left.

My room number was 39703 which was a standard room with a king size bed overlooking the Mandalay Bay's parking deck and the Western mountains further out. The reason for my stay was business, having a conference on site. The conference was excellent at each corner - the staff being very helpful at each request. However, my room experience was very mixed. So much so, I would hesitate to recommend this Four Seasons. Read the below for details. The usual; The Good, The OK, The Bad, and The Ugly. The Good 1. Concierge's desk - excellent staff in helping with every request. Job will done. 2. Food/drink at both restaurants - Charlie Palmer and Veranda. Good service, food very nice, expansive wine list at Palmers. 3. Laundry service / shoe shining - both were timely and well done. 4. The bed. Clean and comfortable with a nice selection of pillows. The OK 1. The room. Nice, large room with all of the expected amenities. The Bad 1. My room key would simply not work each evening. Not a problem typically, however the distance back to the front desk is about 10 minutes. Each night I called the front desk asking them to send security to my room. I can understand the first night, but each night? Something is wrong. 2. On my final day of checkout, I requested a 18:00 checkout which I was granted. However, upon return to my room at about 17:00, my room key didn't work. I was no longer in the mood. The security personnel said the room keys are only valid until 16:00 when asking for a late checkout. Why didn't the front deck advise me of this so I could have my keys exchanged? 3. Room noise. I could hear a quite loud \"running water\" sound at various times during my stay. I thought it may have been the neighbors shower, but never figured it out. It was very loud, but I luckily only heard it a couple of times and never reported it. 4. Internet service. Very s....l....o....w..... Don't even try the wireless service in the rooms, it is painfully slow. The Ethernet cable worked better but still lacked the speed you would expect from a 5* hotel. 5. Television. The channels were very fuzzy (not clear). I thought maybe it was an issue due to the weather, but it continued throughout my stay. The Ugly 1. Daily room key issue (see above). 2. Upon checkout the front desk advised they would have their car take me and two colleagues to the airport. But since we had 4 suitcases, the driver said we couldn't fit into one car and put us into a taxi - where all of our bags fit. Are you kidding? The s500 cannot fit 4 standard sized bags? When I asked, the driver seemed miffed and didn't want to deal with it. Not good service at all and left a negative impression on my entire stay. I would not spend over $150/night to stay there again. The $150 is a maximum the property deserves taking everything into consideration. Believe me, there are much nicer properties up and down the strip. I am actually not too happy writing this review - I would rather have had a much more pleasant experience......

And when my friends and I asked for a cab to go to a show, the hotel offered the hotel car rather than our taking a taxi! There are many other examples of how wonderful everyone was. And we loved the peacefulness of the hotel, only venturing into the Mandalay Bay casino when we wanted, not everytime we left our hotel room. Also ate at the Verandah for lunch which was good, and Charlie Palmer's for dinner, which was great!

My children were actually being VERY well-behaved. In fact, the drunk adult patrons the next morning were 5 times louder than my children were at any point, but nobody asked them to be quiet. I resented the double standard. However, when we tried to hang out in the Mandalay Bay section of the pools, we found that we were unable to order any food and have it charged to our room. So we had to go back and forth: Lazy River for play, back to the Four Seasons for food, etc. This was frustrating.

The hotel itself is located at the top of the Mandalay Bay complex located on floor 35-39. It has it's own independant lobby and elevators at ground level, so you do not need to walk through any casinos to get to the hotel. From the beginning we were welcomed. On our arrival from the airport we were checked in swiftly and courteously then shown where the elevators were. We got given cold bottled water to refresh us after our journey. The elevator goes to the floors 35-39 and you have access to the casino level if you wish. Our room was on the 39th floor with a strip view. The room was a twin room with two very comfortable queen sized beds. It was well very clean and well decorated with solid wood furniture and soft furnishings. There was a large screen television with access to many channels, movies, games and the Internet. The bedside table had a lamp, ipod dock and bedside alarm clock. There was a large comfortable chair and footstool to relax as well as a desk and two chairs with writing equipment. There was a well-stocked minibar with snacks and drinks and plenty of closet space. The bathroom was clean and bright with a marble suite and a great shower and bath. Plenty of clean towels and bathroom products like L'Occitane soap and shampoo. Our room service was super-efficient and we often returned to find our beds had been made and the room had been cleaned. Fresh fruit was delivered on one of the nights as well as bottled water on a regular basis. There were lots of other services that we had access to that we didn't necessarily use like laundry services, in-room dining and use of the business and conference centres. My colleague did visit the spa which is at the ground level and he was full of praise about it. The hotel has got a steak house as well as a contemporary Italian restaurant called Verandah.

Room was definitely clean, concierge for the most part extremely friendly, food and nummies in the restaurants were tasty but oh no, don't order room service. Soggy pizza, burnt pancacks, a sickenly sweet smoothy. Based on a quick dinner downstairs they can do better. Encountered very loud disco one night -- front desk tried to convince me it was from the roof top but no, next night not so (thank heaven). Definitely nice to be off to the side with fewer waits for things. Bathroom -- the hairdryer blew all the fuses, then they brought a new one and it died. My hair is not that thick. Those L'occidente products are extremely drying -- don't think of that as remotely high end -- give me some good Fresh Rice bath or Bergamot age delay body creams -- then I'd fee like you went the extra country mile. So, would I stay again for about 350 a night? Not sure. Did appreciate concierge getting us a fountain view window at Olives. But hey, it's Vegas, one can just lighten up and go with it. One aside -- Balinese masages a must - they really know where they're doing and you're going to be transported to another planet. Go there. It's a pretty planet !!

We booked on late and while others where only staying in Vegas a couple of nights before moving on we decided we couldn't be bothered with travelling around and opted to soak up some winter sun by the pool instead, so were looking for a base for around 10 nights and couldn't get into any of the hotels above. The closest we could get was the Four Seasons which takes up the top five floors of the Mandalay Bay, allowing access to all the facilities of all the hotels on the complex as well as some exclusive areas for FS guests only. Staying in Vegas for 10 nights seems fairly unheard of unless you're headlining somewhere but we got a great deal on the FS - expedia was pricing around \u00a3220 a night but we shopped around online and got it for about \u00a3120. For this money I think the FS is fantastic - I'm not sure I'd pay \u00a3220 - there are lots of good hotels around in Vegas for less. We stayed at the Bellagio last year for around \u00a3100 a night and it's much more central to the main attractions on the strip and similarly luxurious. We also got and $50 spa credit each on check it which we didn't use cos the treatments were a little pricey. We got a fantastic room literally looking right down the strip, like something out of a postcard. Watching the news in the morning for the weather forecast the webcam view was almost identical which shows it's one of the best views around. The room itself wasn't huge but, as they say, it was perfectly formed. A nice big bed with good quality linens, big TV and lots of wardrobe space. The bathroom wasn't huge and the bath and shower seemed smaller than standard, but BVLGARI toiletries were great! I really liked the ipod docking station but I thought the WiFi charge was excessive at $14.99 for 24 hours. Heres a tip though for wifi addicts - if you go down to the beach at Mandalay Bay which you can use as a FS guest there's free wifi there. I thought the hotel did well on special touches - we had a hand written note in our room from the manager with truffles on arrival, saying if we needed anything to just ask. On the last night we got another note with melted chocolate and strawberries. We ordered room service a couple of times and always thought it good value and good quality. By the FS pool the staff cannot do enough for you, they set your sunlounger up with super fluffy towels and bring iced water jugs to your side - and that's before they come around cleaning your sunglasses, spraying Evian mist on your face and dishing out complimentry smoothies, ice lollies and melon. The pool itself is only small but it's much quieter and more relaxing than Mandalay's beach which was bustling in October so imagine would be crazy busy in summer. All in all we liked this hotel - it's just a little way out for wandering up and down the strip. You can get on the free monorail as far as Excalibur but it is a long walk up to Bellagio/Paris/Venetian/Ceasers or the Mirage, which is what I would describe as central strip territory. The facilities in the Mandalay or OK - we ate there a couple of times - but the casino was quiet and lacking in atmosphere compared to other hotels with more passing traffic. For daytime gambling we really enjoyed the dealertainers at the Imperial Palace of all places for a real laugh and great atmosphere with low minimums... but the Bellagio casino is good at night and you can't beat the restaurants around the hotel's lake for pure views and experience. Bit pricier this year than last but that was partly due to a poor exchange rate for us Brits! Hope this helps - if you are heading to Vegas we saw the Beatle's LOVE show at the Mirage this time and would highly, highly recommend it.

The rooms are located on the top 6 floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel, thus you are guaranteed to be high up. The room was very nicely furnished, comfortable bed, large bathroom with a separate tub and shower. They had a kids \"toiletry bag\" with shampoo, conditioner, lotion for my daughter. Also a nice touch - they had my daughter's name spelled out with those sponge letters that kids play with in the bath-tub. It was difficult to figure out the TV channels but we were not in the room much to worry about it. It was great to be able to use the Mandalay Bay beach as a benefit of staying here, we loved the lazy river though were disappointed that we could not use the wave pool due to my daughter being too short. We went in summmer, it was extremely hot and we spent half a day just staying in the lazy river. The pool at Four Seasons was nice and way quieter. After all the noise, crowds and racket at the Mandalay beach, it was nice to go to the Four Seasons pool and just relax. This pool is for Four Seasons guests only, and so it was never crowded. Service was great, they bring out a jug of iced water when you get there, and the staff is always walking around making sure everyone is taken care of.

We arrived around 1:30, of course the room wasn't ready, so we walked into the Mandalay bay and grabbed lunch, something cafe right by the guest elevators.... Yummy. The room was ready after lunch so we checked in, nice thing is this hotel is on the top floors of the Mandalay so your gonna have a great view. Guest reception agent, was really nice and helpful, pointed us in the right direction and headed on our way... 36th floors later, we arrived. Nothing to impressive except the view.

Not no keen: *Pool girl seemed not to be happy to be there, orders took a bit too long, the order wasn't to hard btw *No birthday amenity in room, after telling the hotel we were there to celebrate our birthdays ( no wow factor) *Hotel staff used the guest elevators which seemed weird when we were in a rush and kept stopping on floors to pick them up *Walked in the lobby restroom to find an associate using it (awkward) We never used our car once for the entire time we were there, seemed funny to pay for valet if its gonna sit there for days, we parked in Mandalay for free, and it only took 5 minutes from our car to the room If you want the best in Vegas, this is the place.

I had been to Vegas once before and chose the Four Seasons as we liked the idea of being able to escape back to somewhere quieter after venturing out into the hustle and bustle. I got a great deal on the BA website and had booked a Superior Room. We arrived at 3.30pm on a Thursday afternoon to be (after an excellent welcome from the valet parkers and door staff) to be told by the woman on reception that our room wasn't ready but that we could upgrade to a suite for $100 extra a night. When I said that I had no interest in paying to upgrade to a suite, I was basically told that I was being foolish as this was amazing value and that we would therefore have to wait for a room to become available. At this point I was very unhappy, firstly for being told how I should spend my money (I was able to find better ways to spend that $400 in Vegas!) and secondly that, despite it being after check-in time, the room that we had booked was not available... this was their problem not mine! I therefore asked to speak to the manager at which point the reception woman mysteriously managed to find us a room... and what a room. We were upgraded to a strip view room although the silly reception woman didn't actually bother telling us that she'd upgraded us and therefore missed out on a great gratuity! This was the only negative we had about the stay. The view from the strip view room was amazing and the room was a good size (although probably small by Vegas standards) and comfortably furnished. Decent L'Occitaine toiletries and I didn't think that the minibar prices were too crazy compared to other hotels (although the $15 internet charge a night irked slightly). I will just echo what others have said on this site about the hotel being an oasis of tranquility; it was great being able to go through that door from Mandalay Bay into a world of refined luxury (and we managed to find the door fine after a while!) and we quite liked being down the south end of the strip away from the \"mad\" middle section. The pool service is everything that has been reported, jugs of water, frozen melon balls, evian spray etc etc, and I thought that the fitness centre was very well equipped. There was a good range of food and drinks available at the pool and again it wasn't stupidly priced. The only time we properly ate at the Hotel was the Sunday breakfast buffet; I would strongly recommend this to anyone. I've seen alot of breakfast buffets at a lot of hotels around the world, but nothing could beat this for quality! Not only were there some interesting options (including doughnuts that you could take away in a box for a midmorning treat!) but most of the options were small portions so that you could have a wider variety. We utilised the concierge desk on a number of occasions and were very impressed. They managed to get us a table for Prime at the Bellagio at 8pm despite us having only been able to manage 9.30 when we tried to book ourselves and their advice was generally useful and impartisan. Overall, I'd recommend this over any other hotel in Vegas if you want a more chilled, relaxing experience but it's likely that it wouldn't be the right place for you if you want a typical Vegas stay!

The furnishings and artwork were traditional. Floor to ceiling windows on 3 sides provided panoramic views of the strip, airport, and pools. Bed linens were comfortable, but the bed lacked the required support and left me with a back ache upon waking each morning. Vanity items were never replaced during our 3 day stay and the towels were small and not luxurious. There was a small, but deep tub and no TV or sit down vanity in the bathroom.

Upon check-in we were upgraded to a 2600 sq ft suite for my husbands b-day. The check-in process was easy and fast, only 4 people in line ahead of us, unlike other Vegas hotels where check in wraps around 100 people deep. The lobby was beautiful. (Just a tip in the lobby every morning they have complimentary coffee and tea til 8am). Are bags were taken from us even before we walked into the lobby and was told they would be brought up to our room immediately. They arrived 5 min after we walked into our room! There was a compl. cake delivered for my husbands bday also. We did utilize the room service for a late night 2am snack and it was hot, delicous, and delivered as promised within 30 min of ordering. The pool was beautiful ate lunch there daily, and again outstanding. My favorite part of the pool was the frozen towels they would pass out, evian spritz, and frozen melon balls they would come around with. The pool was very nice, relaxing, and quiet. Loved the fact that you could use the Mandalay Bay wave pool and lazy river but they cannot come to our pool! The workout facility was top of the line with a Gatorade dispenser and lemon water We did use the concierge one time and they were incredible! The hotel does have a house car (09 Cadillac Escalade) where the driver will take you anywhere in a 3mi range. We used this feature once and did tip him well. Nothing like pulling up to a restaurant and getting out of the car and everyone looking to see who it is! Very cool! Just ask the door man if the car is available (it is 1st come 1st serve:) I really can't say enough great things about the hotel, it was just incredible! I read all the reviews on this hotel and some people complained and I was thinking they are just miserable people if they couldn't love everything about this hotel.

Previous reviews all give good descriptions of the entrance and lobby so I won't go into that area. We stayed in a strip view suite on the 39th floor. The view was absolutely amazing with almost the entire lower end of the strip spread out before you, from Mandalay Bay all the way to Treasure Island. The surrounding mountains and cityscape were also incredible. We also had a view of the airport which I find quite fascinating. The airplanes taking off and landing was not the least bit intrusive to us. The nightclub above our room was much more noticeable, especially at 1:30 in the am. While it didn't interfere overmuch, we still noticed it each night. Those who are light sleepers might wish to put a floor or two between themselves and this area. The furnishings in the room, as others have pointed out, could definitely use some updating. The two large plasma screen tv's were nice as were the addition of large potted ferns. However, the rest of the decor lacked the expected richness that goes with other FS properties. Our biggest letdown in the room was, by far, the bathroom. I would rate it as adequate rather than good. In this price range of hotel, I would expect a double vanity as well as a slightly larger shower. The deep soaking tub was the one standout in this area. The service was certainly above average but I can't, in all honesty, rate it as exceptional. While I can't give any one example of poor service, overall, it just seemed not exactly what I expected. Upon check-in, we were asked about our preference of newspaper but one was never delivered, valets seemed very harried when there were more than two vehicles present at the same time, taxis weren't moved through this area very smoothly. Just small, somewhat annoying little things. After check-in was completed, we were walked around the corner and simply told the elevators are \"that way\". No effort was made to explain any of the hotel offerings (i.e. the pool, spa, restuarants etc). I must reiterate what others have pointed out about the cost of valet parking. Paying over $350 a night for a room, you would certainly expect this sort of thing to be included. Every other hotel in Vegas has figured this out. We used room service three times and each time it was delivered promptly, at the proper temperature and the presentation was very nicely done. Nothing was forgotten and they really seemed to anticipate everything that could possibly be needed. Very well done. While we certainly enjoyed our time at the Four Seasons Las Vegas, and we would recommend it, I can't say we would necessarily pay quite this much again to stay here.

My husband and I were at the Four Seasons 4 nights over Labor Day weekend. Arrived Thursday night and had a very relaxing light (late) dinner at Verandah with excellent food and service. Spent our days at the pool with excellent pool service (not sure what the staff to guest ratio was but it was high enough that we felt really well looked-after.) When we first arrived and chose our lounge chairs we received a full pitcher of ice water that was refilled throughout the day along with nice treats throughout the day (popsicle, bit of frozen banana, iced towel - scented with eucalyptus on one of the days, evian water spritz, frozen melon ball) which were really nice. The pool service was very attentive and genuinely friendly. The pool area is not huge as in some of the other Strip hotels but it was completely adequate for the number of guests. Some lounge chairs had all-day sun exposure whereas others had all-day shade and some had partial sun/partial shade depending on time of day (which can be a good thing in Las Vegas in the summer!) Rooms were very nice and very clean. Bed was very comfy (not too soft and not too firm!) Twice-daily housekeeping service was really nice. The FS has two restaurants: Verandah for breakfast, lunch, dinner (all excellent) and Charlie Palmer for dinner - really wonderful food and especially wonderful service. Logistically, the Four Seasons occupies the top 5 floors of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Its ground level facilities (lobby, restaurants, pool, spa, exercise room, etc) are completely separate from the MB. The elevator takes you from the lobby straight to the 35th-39th floors. If you were to never take the small side door on the \"C\" level (for casino) into the MB you'd never know you were next door. Being separate from the MB allows the FS to remain completely without a bit of cigarette smoke in case that is important to you. If you DO go into the MB you will find that you can easily walk to the Luxor (without having to go outside into the outdoor weather) and thereby be almost to hotels such as Excalibur, MGM Grand and New York...so the rest of the Strip is not far. If you want to go much farther than MGM Grand/New York New York take a cab and make sure the driver takes the freeway 1 or 2 exits north (depending where you are going) rather than Las Vegas Blvd because the traffic can be a giant mess. Cab fare to the central strip area (Wynn, Mirage, Venetian) was about $15.00-$16.00 without tip. Speaking of tips: make sure you tip for good service! I always say \"feel good about your tips\" and that means if someone has done something to make your life easier or more pleasant...return the favor! I see waaay too many people forgetting to tip...especially if you are going to stay somewhere as nice as the Four Seasons...tip it up! The doorman, the person checking you in, the bag attendant delivering your bags, the pool attendant setting up your chaise lounge, the housekeeper...don't forget! (Especially you young ones...get in the habit!) (Sorry to be preachy...) So, in all, if you like Las Vegas for the fun options but would prefer a calm and quiet place to stay (especially if the noise of Las Vegas gets to you...) stay at the Four Seasons.

We were disappointed. I have stayed in most of the hotels on the strip, and recently in both Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel. I would recommend staying in either of these hotels over the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons rooms are very much like any regular Mandalay Bay rooms. The lobby was nice, but way too far from the rest of the Mandalay. Valet parking was $18. How does every other hotel have free valet and Four Seasons requires you to pay for it, that makes no sense to me. I parked at Mandalay because I never saw a point to paying that fee. The alure of the Four Seasons is the service. However, I found their service to be lacking. The front desk nicely offered to walk us to the elevator which honestly turned into a elaborate sales pitch for the spa. He never even told us where anything else was. On the walk between the front desk he told me all I needed to know about the spa, but not how to get to the pool, fitness, or even the elevator. In fact, when he left us in front of the spa I had to ask him how to get to the elevators from there. He also asked which paper we would like, none was ever delivered. The true test of our trip came on Saturday night. My wife with 30 minutes left before meeting friends for a show panicked because the hair dryer in our room was not working. I thought, not a problem, a hotel known for service should have a new hair dryer here in less than 5 minutes. I called and told them the problem and I needed a hair dryer in a hurry. Saving you the long story 30 minutes, 4 phone calls, and 1 trip to the front desk later we left.....and just as we were walking out the new hair dryer finally shows up. Was this a big deal? Not really, but if you are going to run an upper end property this is a simple guest request, they failed! In summary, most reviews rave about the Four Seasons.

The receptionist (Cara) was exceptional and was genuinely warm and welcoming and we instantly felt like valued guests. We were lucky enough to be given a great upgrade to a beautiful suite, and recieved several genuine apologies that there would be a delay getting it ready for us (this delay was a grand total of 4 minutes 10 seconds!).

Turn down was excellent every night, with water by the bed, slippers and robes laid out, and all the towels in the bathroom replaced. Housekeeping was always exemplary.

That was my initial reaction as I had never seen the hotel. That is because it is an hotel within a hotel! The Four Seasons takes up the top floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel block. The only sign for the hotel is an entrance sign on Las Vegas Boulevard South near the Mandalay Bay Conference Center. The lobby is on the ground floor and unlike other strip hotels it does not have a casino nor a parking garage. There is easy access direct into the Mandalay Bay casino, and if you don't want to use the valet parking ($19/ night) you can park in Mandalay Bay. The Four Seasons is a great place to stay if you want to be in Vegas but avoid the full on Blitz of casino noise and bustle every time you leave your room to go anywhere. You can easily come and go without seeing a casino area. But there is easy access via a room key controlled door directly into the Mandalay bay casino. The pool at the hotel is great. The pool is on the ground floor and fenced off and although it gets busy it does not feel as packed as other pools in Vegas. Service at the pool is outstanding, they set up your beds, you can order food, they bring round jugs of ice water all the time, bring round small smoothies, popsicles and iced fruit. If you want it is a short walk to the Mandalay Wave pool and pools. The pool at the hotel tend to be mostly adults. The service overall is what makes the hotel so good. There is a lot of attention to detail everywhere. The room cleaning is meticulous and they take time to sort and tidy your toiletries even! In the excellent (and quiet) fitness room they check if you want a drink as you work out. Overall the four seasons make you feel like a guest, not just a number. As the hotel is at the end of the strip you also feel a bit out of the madness. But as there is a tram that runs every 5 minutes to Excalibur you can get to the strip fast. But is a long walk to places like Caesar\u2019s palace, so cabs or a car is a good idea. The rooms are a good size and comfortable. We chose a strip view which I highly recommend as you get a stunning view both in the day and especially at night. As the hotel takes the top 4 floors all are great. We were on the top floor (39th) which was amazing. It is worth watching the four seasons site for promotions, we got 3 nights for the price of 2 which is a great deal.

I was and I'm a frequent guest of this beatiful hotel where service , rooms , overall ambiance are really outstanding. But this time was different than the last time and I had a very difficult approach with the front desk and the first day of my stay was simply a nightmare. Did a check in around noon and the room was not ready. They simply promised me to call my mobile phone when the room was supposed to be ready but never received any call. Four hours later finally I've got the room ( deluxe room ) but it was different than the one booked trough their local reservation system ( strip wiew). Back to the front desk and moved to the right room but ... it was dirty especially the bathroom.. So called again the front desk , talked with a manager and receive a free breakfast for the next morning. That room was really noisy despite to my specific request by the time of my booking. So the next morning had a breakfast at the Verandah restaurant and unlike the promises of the front desk I had to pay for it.. Too many mistakes for me , when you plan to stay at the FS you deserve the best and this is was not my case- So talked with the Front Desk and ready to leave the same day even if I had a reservation for six nights.. Finally I was able to talk with a very nice manager and I did receive a wonderful upgrade in one of their beatiful suites overlooking the entire strip. It was a very nice present really appreciated. From this moment everything was perfect , the hotel is really nice and I loved the overall quiet , really unique in Vegas. Compared with the last time they are charging for wlan-wifi while the last time was free. I personally found the service at the pool not on level with my last stay and the prices for breakfast at the Verandah too expensive even for a FS ( thye charge 35 $ for the breakfast buffet )... So ready to leave and at the check out they did take care of my breakfast of the first day but they simply charged around 1000 $ more than due to my room account.. Another mistake really not understandable at any Four Seasons. I will return ?

I can take Vegas for only a few days (too much noise, too many crowds). The beauty of The Four Seasons is that it's tucked away inside the Mandalay Bay and you escape all the noise, people and goings-on there. (The Mandalay Bay lobby was always crowded no matter what time we walked through.) As soon as you enter The Four Seasons, it's very quiet and tranquil. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite on the 35th floor. Loved it! We had an abundance of room for 3 people. (Really, the suite was huge!) We need to be able to spread out and had plenty of room to do so. Housekeeping provided great service and they were always leaving bottles of water. (I guess they don't want you to dehydrate in the Vegas sun!) There was also a candy dish on the coffee table that kept getting refilled, to my son's delight! Guests of The Four Seasons also have access to the Mandalay Bay's pool/wave pool/beach area, which my ten-year-old son was anxious to try. We walked over during our first afteroon and was shocked to see how crowded it was. (I thought people avoided Vegas in the heat of the summer!) There was nowhere to sit, so we thought about renting a cabana for the afternoon as there were plenty which sat empty. I'm sorry, but at $400, there was no way that was going to happen! Absolutely crazy! (It's the Mandalay Bay, for Pete's sake!) We thought about trying the lazy river before heading back, but you have to purchase an inner tube for almost $50!! We were happy to head back to the pool at The Four Seasons. They know how to treat their guests. The staff immediately came over to us with towels, set up our chairs and brought us a pitcher of ice water. Throughout the afternoon, they offered us complimentary Evian mists, popsicles, frozen melon, and chilled towels. No one provides service like The Four Seasons. We had dinner and breakfast at The Four Seasons' Verandah restaurant. We had dinner our first night and were exhausted, so we wanted to eat quickly and go to sleep. I ordered the short ribs which sounded so good. Unfortunately, when my meal arrived, it was cold. Not even lukewarm, but cold. On the plus side, the few bites I had were delicious, but I wasn't going to eat a cold meal. They, of course, offered to make a fresh plate for me, but I was just too tired to eat, so they removed it from the bill. We also had breakfast there which was alright, but nothing great. I recommend eating elsewhere as there are so many great restaurants in Vegas. We did ask the concierge for restaurant recommendations as we were meeting up with family near Caesar's and wanted to find a restaurant to suit everyone's tastes . The concierge recommended Spago in the Forum Shops at Caesar's. It was excellent! Everyone enjoyed their meals and I was very impressed with their food and service!

Being it was past the time needed to cancel and rebook, I decided to wait and ask for the new rate at check in. They had no problem with adjusting to the new rate. The room was a fairly typical hotel room, though the marble bath/entry, towel/sheet quality, cleanliness were superb. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Little touches included a wonderful turndown service with bottled water, slippers, comp. shoe shine service and an expansive mini bar with room to put in your own items were appreciated. The bellman even removes the airline luggage tags prior to bringing to your room, which I can't recall ever having been done for us before (a small thing, but noticed just as well). The pool service was phenomenal (with one exception, we spent 3 full days by the pool)! When you arrive to the pool area, you are greeted near the front by a pool attendant. The attendant escorts you to your chairs, lays down a chair cover (huge towel), gives you another towel and places a pitcher of ice water next to you on your table. They continually come around to make sure your water is iced and full. We only had to wait one day (saturday @ noon). They put you on a wait list and take down your cell number. We went to the pool bar, ordered drinks and lunch and within about 10 minutes our chairs were ready. The bartender then brought our drinks over to our chairs so he could see where to send our lunch. We ate lunch on our lounge chairs everyday. Attendants periodically come around with various items....Evian spritz, cold cucumbers for your eyes, cold towels, frozen melon balls, popsicles, etc. We had excellent service from everyone, except one female food server, who shall remain nameless (a complaint was made, so hopefully she will straighten up, or maybe was just having a really bad day). The house car service was great. We used it several times, including to return to the airport. The longest we had to wait was 10 minutes. The pros (as listed above) will bring us back, though only if we are going to pretty much relax around the pool, go to the spa or generally just be spoiled. There are not many restaurants (only 2 at FS, though Charlie Palmer was excellent) or lounges which match our taste. The scene around Mandalay Bay is just too hectic and does not provide enough options as far as fine dining, shopping, shows etc. We prefer the more upscale feel around the Wynn and Palazzo, though customer service is, by far, not as spectacular as at the FS. By the way, don't waste your money at Minus 5 (ice bar)....$25 pp to get in includes one small drink.

Room service was fast we ordered 2 bottles of champagne late at night and let them sit overnight drank them in the morning. We did not try the restaurants at FS. We were offered the car service (we did not ask for it ) and used this twice, perhaps because no cabs were around. We tipped $10 for 1 ride and $20 for the other. It made us feel special that they offered us the car. We went to Vegas with two other couples that were not staying there and it made for a lot of cab rides, tram rides, long walks so being offered the car was nice. I would stay here again only if it was just my husband and I alone and also if we were going during pool season. We really enjoyed the pool! PS It is non-gaming, and I do not care for the Mandalay Bay Casino, so keep that in mind.

When we arrived from the airport, the doormen are there to open the car door, a bellboy takes the cases and we are ushered to reception. Check in was smooth, no problems. Our room was spacious, clean and beautifully furnished. On arrival to the room, there was a knock on the door and a waitor had brought up a platter of fresh fruit with a bottle of spring water, two glasses and two plates with silver cutlery. There was a hand written letter from the manager welcoming us to the hotel. The pool area is beautiful and there were always plenty of sunbeds no matter what time of day we arrived. The staff ensured every guest was comfortable. Regular ice pops, fruit, cucumber slices and drink samples were brought round for each guest along with evian spray for face. Iced water was regularly topped up. Fresh towels were placed at each step out of the pool for guests to take. The lobby and corridors are immaculate, lots of polished marble floors, beautiful ornaments and furniture. The Spa is beautiful, my husband went overy day to use the eucalyptus steam room, showers and shaving facilities. Lockers are provided with shorts, shoes, robes and shaving equipment. Iced handtowels and water/juice are provided complimentary. The use of the facilities at Mandalay Bay is superb, the pools and lazy river are fun and the whole atmosphere is that of a tropical beach party. Brilliant for younger guests and families. It was lovely to get back to the peace and tranquility of the Four Seasons if thats what you wanted. The Mandalay Bay hotel is great, with a plush lobby and casino and a lovely coconutty/suntan cream smell. Try the shark reef aquarium. the underwater shipwreck is amazing. Found the restaurants at Mandalay Bay quite pricey but then thats only to be expected in Las Vegas. The casino is fab, the dealers and staff are really friendly and remembered us each time we visited. The monorail from Mandalay to Excalibur is convenient and runs approx every 5 mins. It also stops at the Luxor hotel. We were lucky to get upgraded to a strip view room because on a particular windy day, the wind was whistling under our door and they were unable to fix it immediately. The strip view was amazing, especially at dusk when all the lights come on. Totally fascinating and we couldnt take our eyes off the view. The rooms were really beautiful, towels changed twice daily, linen is lovely crisp cotton. They even turn the clock to face you on the bedside table at night so you can see the time in the morning!!! We got lovely little cakes left in our room on our last night. They replenish the L'occitane bath products whenever anything is used just once. Bathrobes and slippers supplied. Lovely power shower and deep bath. Hairdyer, iron and ironing board supplied. Minibar in fridge along with snacks very pricey. Coffee maker and tea making facilities supplied, a kettle is available also when requested.

In a world where communication is the standard and no longer an option and in a expensive hotel such as this one the WIFI should be free. One other remark is that the noise from 35 floors down comes into the room. Unfortunately only double glasing was used and this could have been better. The swimming pool is too small for the amount of people using it. Four Season quality involves enough space in and around the swimming pool with soft music making the stay at the pool more enjoyable.

Expensive but wonderful (and no high-roller rooms to get comped because there is no casino!) My fiance and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my 50th birthday. We live in New York City and wanted to relax by a pool and do nothing but we wanted a night life, too. We were staying for 8 nights, and I wanted to be treated like a queen for my birthday. So when they found out it was my birthday, they were going to send a cake to our room. But I explained to them that I'm diabetic and they offered me a sugar-free cake, but I asked for fruit instead. Well, they sent fruit up to our room every day for our whole stay! And then, on our first day and on my actual birthday, they sent a fruit and cheese platter! Everyone who works at the Four Seasons addresses you by your name and everyone is extremely helpful and friendly - from the Front Desk staff to the maids. Speaking of the maids, they do a phenomenal job. They thoroughly clean and change the towels, etc., twice a day (more if you request it for some reason). They pay attention to what you need and you don't have to ask. For example, I use a lot of towels when I shower and she noticed that so she started bringing a lot of towels and putting them on the shelves in the bath area for us. I never had to ask for extras. Shower was excellent (separate from tub) - great water pressure. Separate toilet area so your roomie can tinkle in private while you're brushing your teeth. Room darkening curtains were great in the morning after a late night out - couldn't tell if it was day or night. Nice big flat screen TV. VERY comfortable bed (king with pillow-top mattress). Lots of great pillows. Wonderful bed linens (very soft cotton, including the duvet cover, so you're never touching anything that someone else's behind touched). Lots of little touches like bottled water by your bed every night, great thick terry cloth robes (one for each of you), a pair of slippers for each of you (they're pretty cheap disposable slippers - nothing to write home about, but they lasted all week very nicely). We got upgraded to a \"strip-view\" room. From what I understand, with the exception of the view, the room is identical to the \"superior\" room, but I didn't see those rooms. The view of the strip is no big deal during the day but at night, when all the neon goes on, it's really cool. We live in a high building at home, so maybe the day view just reminds me of home but if you're from a small town, you'll be amazed by the view. I think the room could have been bigger but it was very acceptable. I would like to have seen a suite (I tried to upgrade but they were full). My guess is that they are incredible. Free WiFi if you have a laptop otherwise you can access the internet via the TV but it's $14.99 for 24 hours and it's very flakey. You're better off using the PC's in the business center. You run your credit card through and get the first 10 minutes free (after that, however, it's $1.00 per minute and be careful about printing anything...it's $1.00 per page to print!!!). There are two phones in the room and one in the bathroom by the toilet. The phone by the bed is a cordless, which is very handy. There is a safe in the room that is easy to program. An iron, a hair dryer, and really nice soaps, shampoo, conditioner. lotion, shower gels in the bathroom. You have full control of the central A/C in the room, which works very well. Unfortunately, you cannot open the windows at all, though. If you put your \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, they are extremely respectful of it...we ordered something from room service and forgot that we had the sign on the door. The delivery person didn't knock on our door and, instead, walkie-talkied to the office who called us to ask if it was OK for the person to knock! Speaking of room service, it's great, but it's really expensive. That said, if they tell you they'll be there in 20 minutes, they are there in 17 minutes! There is a mini bar in the room and a tray of delicious looking snack foods but they're expensive and we didn't make use of them - except for a bottle of Fiji Water. Concierges are very helpful but don't expect them to be able to recommend anything inexpensive. They don't seem to have a grasp of how espensive the restaurants are when you ask them to recommend something reasonable. Do your own research to find inexpensive options. But do use the concierge to make reservations at restaurants in other hotels for you. Speaking of which, the two restaurants in the hotel are excellent. Verandah has very nice food, serves breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner. They also have a really nice outdoor seating area just off from the pool. In addition, they serve as the source of food that you can order when you sit by the pool. All good. The other restaurant is Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse. Amazing food and service. Top notch. The hotel's private car (a Cadillac SUV) is available to anyone in the hotel who requests it if you are going within 3 miles of the hotel - but it's first come first serve, so when you walk outside the front door, ask the doorman if the car is available. If not, take a taxi, but if it is available, it's free (tip the driver), really comfortable, and a wonderful option. They won't pick you up from wherever you go, though, once you're there, you're on your own to get back (taxis are easily available everywhere you go - but they don't cruise on the strip...you have to get one at a taxi stand at any hotel or store). The hotel really is an oasis of serenity, as advertised. It was such a pleasure coming \"home\" to our peaceful lobby after being in the casinos and/or the other hotels. Our stay was for 9 days, which began on Memorial Day weekend. It was a madhouse everywhere that weekend - it was like being on Spring Break in Cancun with a ton of young 20-somethings. Noisy, crowded, overwhelming. But not in OUR hotel. Oh, it was busy - and full. But the only place it was any sort of issue was at the pool. Well, not an \"issue\" - it's just that there were way more people at the pool on the holiday weekend than there were at any other time. But it was an easygoing relaxed crowd. Unlike right next door at the Mandalay pools with thumping loud music and waaaay too many people. By the way, when you stay at the Four Seasons, you can use all of the Mandalay pools but not vice versa. We only used the Four Seasons pool...just simply more relaxing and a better class of clientele (not drunken loud kids showing off their boob implants). Order lunch while you're lounging by the pool. They bring you a tray and the food is really good. The poolside service is excellent. On the slower days (non-holiday weekend), they come by and spray you with water to cool you off, offer you free popsicles, frozen melon balls, and even asked if we needed our sunglasses cleaned! Casino...there is none. But Mandalay Bay is actually part of the same building as the Four Seasons and they do have a Casino. I didn't see every hotel but I can say this - I thought the Bellagio was the nicest casino I've ever seen. I thought the Venetian was a beautiful hotel and the casino was nice. I thought the MGM Grand stunk from cigarette smoke, even in the restaurants. I would not be able to gamble there. I thought Caesars was a horror show and just gave me a bad vibe from start to finish. Mandalay Bay's casino is relatively small if you're a table player. Tons of slot/video machines, though. But I'm a blackjack player. There are no non-smoking areas, but it wasn't too bad. Smoke really bothers me so I wasn't thrilled. At night, you can't find anything lower than a $15 minimum-bet table. But - it's all really easy to get to from Four Seasons. You don't have to leave the building to get there. So that's where we played. It would have been great if the Bellagio casino was that close but we just simply didn't feel like jumping into a cab to go there. And when the gambling is over, you walk through the (virtually unmarked) door and go from a loud, boisterous casino into a very quiet, clean, peaceful hallway at your private Four Seasons elevator and leave the noise and smoke behind. Aaaahhhh....Wonderful! Ultimately, I was very pleased with our choice of where to stay. I was just about to book the Bellagio when it occurred to me that it was a holiday weekend and it might be crazy there. Boy, was I right and I'm glad we chose the Four Seasons instead. Expensive but worth the money. If we go back, that's where I'm staying. My only complaints: There was an odd smell in part of the lobby for the entire time we were there and another guest told me it was the same last year. The spa was beautiful but there is no hot tub / jaccuzzi in there. Mandalay has one but you have to pay $30/day to use it and you have to walk through the casino after your massage if you come from Mandalay - that would un-relax you in a hurry. Also, although the bathroom has a \"soaking\" bathtub (very deep), it also has no jaccuzzi jets and there is no curtain or glass door around it, so the hot bath gets cold very quickly. Oh, and no chocolates on the pillow at night, LOL!

Flowers delivered for birthday sent by family member and Cake compliments of Four Seasons were nicely done. My Mom had her first facial and loved it (and thought the esthetician was great). My extra long (180 min?) massage seemed a little decadant but it was one of the best deep tissue massages ever! Warmly greated by spa/gym staff every AM when I went to work out at the gym. Gym small and (a year ago- hopefully this was fixed) individual TV's on treadmill were controlled by a remote control that was not dedicated to your treadmills TV. A woman next to me kept pointing her remote my direction and changing my TV. I could not have been more irritated by this! Also, the Temp controls in the Accessible Spa shower were tempermental and I was glad I was present to help my Mom out, otherwise, the drastic change to hot water could have caused problems. The spa area was smallish but luxurious with a very nice staff. We enjoyed breakfast and afternoon tea (reserve ahead) in Verandah. Room service for breakfast was wonderful and toiletries luxurious. However we were very dissapointed with the accessible bathroom. A standard tub was fitted with bulky huge bench/chair but there was nothing to sit on in the shower. I was very disappointed with the response that I recieved from the front desk when I called down to ask about a shower chair for my Mom. \"No we do not have one.\" There was a shower chair in the accessible bathroom in the spa so I ended up packing everything in a big tote and wheeling my Mom down to the spa so she could have a nice shower (with the iffy temp. control). The spa staff was gracious but I felt a little bit like a couple of ragtag refugees schleping down to the shower every day when I know the Four Seasons could afford to get a $45 shower chair to be sent up to our room. (The huge bathtub chair woud not fit in the shower). I was also unimpressed with the front desk staff on the one occasion I was having problems with my key-card. Mom and I had been by the pool and we approached the front desk ( I was pushing Mom in her wheelchair ) and asked if I could get another key card for us to use. The front desk attendant looked at us and said \" we need to see your ID\". I was loaded-down with pool/sun gear and my Mom in a wheelchair. I explained that my wallet was in our safe in the room. Basically he said (I'm paraphrasing here): \"too bad\". It really would have been nice if he had offered to send someone up to our room with us and they could check our ID there. We did enjoy the non-gaming oasis and quiet retreat of the resort, but the two incidents with lackluster staff really left us feeling lukewarm (at best) about the Four Seasons Vegas.

Here is why I didn't give this hotel 4 or 5 stars - each morning the jets across the freeway would start their engines at 6am - I was taking some time off and didn't want to get up at 6am. ugh.

I love that they are so dependable, and you will always get what you pay for. I will say that I was a little disappointed in the \"blah\" room decorations here, but it was minor. CHECK-IN: Easy. I arrived at 11:30am on a Thursday and my strip-view room was ready. This was nice since I wanted to have lunch before my 2pm spa appointment. ROOM: Strip view was nice, but I am honestly not sure it is worth the tremendous jump in price from a regular room. At night it was cool to see the lights. . .but you could also walk outside at night see them. I would definitely not pay for the view again, although I appreciated others' recommendations here about it. I think I would have wondered what I was missing--now I know. Bed--typical, comfortable, clean and nice, cool, soft sheets. Bath--I didn't like the showers here-the water pressure was actually too hard, and there was no way to adjust the shower head to make it softer. I know, picky, picky, but not everyone likes to blasted out of the shower. Desk/chair/tv: Very utilitarian. I could have been anywhere. . .not as comfortable as other FS properties. FOOD: I have the brunch at the hotel restaurant--it's a bit pricey and probably not worth it. the food was \"typical\" brunch food, and after having \"The Buffet\" at Wynn for 1/2 the price, there really is no comparison. The remainder of my meals I ate next door at Mandalay bay--nothing I would return for, including the much-heralded \"Burger Bar.\" It was good, but $25 for a burger and fries??? POOL: The pool area is lovely, and the pool itself is warm. The attendants were great--constantly checking on you, even bringing nuts or chips if you want them. Spending an afternoon here was definitely my most relaxing day. SPA: I had a facial here which was lovely. The facilities are top-notch, and the services comprehensive. They have people on \"stand-by\" so you can generally walk-in and request a same-day service. They were also very generous with samples of the products they used during my service, which is helpful before committing hundreds of dollars to a new routine. CASINO: This hotel is attached to Mandalay Bay--the casino is disappointing, as is the Luxor, which is also close by. It is very easy to tell the difference in the older casinos and the newer ones. This is definitely \"old.\" LOCATION: This is the biggest drawback to an otherwise nice stay. The FS is so far away from everything that you are constantly renting a cab. . .it's 3 miles to Bellagio, and 6 miles to Wynn/Encore, which can be a nice walk unless you are dressed for dinner and a show. . .this is also the main reason I would not return to this property.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean City, NJ", "Title": "\u201cUltimate Luxury in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Love2DineOutNJ", "ReviewID": "UR26692878", "Content": "I\u2019ve only vacationed to Las Vegas once, but now that I\u2019ve stayed at the Four Seasons I can honestly proclaim that I will never stay anywhere else but there in future visits!

It was simply breathtaking to look at both day and night\u2014the best part about the location of the Four Seasons on the top floors of the Mandalay Bay tower is the fact that it is at the far end of the strip, not the middle, so you can see everything and not just half of the glamorous hotels. Our room was spacious and comfortable for 4 adults. We also loved the pool area because it was a beautiful, quiet retreat from the rowdy Mandalay Bay wave pool, although we could go over there whenever we wanted if we desired to soak in the party atmosphere at any point. It was awesome that Four Seasons guests had the option to use the Four Seasons pool or Mandalay\u2019s pool, but Mandalay guests had to stay at Mandalay. Some of the little things that we loved about our stay as we lounged by the pool for 5 days in the hot July sun were the amenities at the pool. Throughout the day, attendants came around and offered us mists of Evian and eucalyptus-infused chilled towels to cool us down, as well as periodic offerings of fresh fruit, cucumbers for our eyes, and popsicles. We also had a pitcher of ice water refilled constantly throughout the afternoon, and there were plenty of servers to take food and drink orders at any time. They had a fabulous menu to order breakfast or lunch at the pool, and they actually brought over a nice tray that fits over the lounge chair so you could eat right there without having to get up! It was so comfortable. One of our primary reasons for selecting the Four Seasons over other luxury resorts like the Bellagio or the Wynn was the fact that even though those resorts are nice, they are still huge and simply cannot offer the level or personalization or quiet pool area feel that Four Seasons can offer. If you want pampering luxury and personalized attention throughout your stay, I highly recommend that you stay at Four Seasons and then just visit the other top hotels for dinner and shopping each night. We are non-gamblers, so this was another plus for us, but even if you gamble recreationally and you still want top-notch service and luxury, you will not be disappointed in the Four Seasons. I suppose the only reason to stay elsewhere would be if you really need to be steps away from the tables and slots or the non-stop party atmosphere of the other casino hotels.

Disliked: * Didn't deposit you on a casino floor, and the doors leading from 4S to the Mandalay casino floor were rather hard to find and out of the way. Which isn't SO bad, I guess, but irritating nonetheless. * I'm not a huge fan of the Mandalay casino... so that didn't help! * The rooms were fairly small and understated, which is okay, but boring. * No 'fun' amenities (I'm constantly finding interesting stuff all over MGM Grand Skylofts for example - like televisions situated in strange places, personalised stationery, etc) All in all, it was very nice, and I would stay at a 4 Seasons located elsewhere, but for Vegas I think there are better options.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Franklin, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGood but some issues\u201d", "Author": "KEWLBEANS", "ReviewID": "UR24876857", "Content": "I was very happy that we chose to stay at the Four Seasons but might think twice about staying here again.

The floor to ceiling windows gave a dramatic cast to the suite, even though we probably didn't have the best area to view. The decor was modern, but not extreme.

Now, let's talk about issues. After check-in hotel requested a 1300$ authorization on my credit card, more than my final bill (I payed 1st night yet and 3rd was free). Maybe in US everyone normally has 5-6 credit cards, but in Italy (I think I could say in Europe) this is not usual, and an authorization remains as a lowered availability for 45 days. Luckily I have 2 c.c. with large availability, but a 2700$ charge (1300$ authorization, 650+taxes payed as 1st night and 650+taxes on check-out) was quite heavy. Not an issue but a wrong (imho) hotel policy. On final bill I found 15$ \"business center charge\". They said \"it's for parcels you've received here\" (great service for this). I will never argue for a 15$ charge on a more than 1k$ bill and I didn't complain at all, but I think every charge should be showed before. I e-mailed the hotel asking for the possibility of receiving parcels, they answered \"Yes,no problem\", but never talked about charge. Anyway, not important. No tv in bathroom, no jacuzzi. I can easily survive shaving in the morning without watching tv, and without bubbles too, but I found tvs in bathroom in the most part of major hotel strip (Media suite at MB, normal room at THE hotel, salon suite at Wynn, Fortuna suite at Palazzo, one bedroom suite at Palms Place, normal room at Trump, you just have to choose. That rooms are all rated 1/2 to 1/10 than sunrise/sunset at FS) and same about jacuzzi, so it's hard to think a 1800$ nt suite doesn't have this stuff. I used internet tv access for a fee 1st day (and others). Wireless keyboard didn't work. I informed immediately front desk about it, but keyboard was not changed during my stay. Luckily, I found another one in bedroom 2nd day and I used that. 2nd sink in bathroom didn't work (water didn't flow at all). I informed front desk only on check-out, but it's hard to think a sink become obstructed in a day, and no one informed front desk about this before. Anyway, it's possible. On 2nd day I used trash bin under sink in kitchenette (coffee filter, sugar pack, paper). The next day, after housekeeper cleaned room, trash bin was still full (I would say I tipped 10$ every morning, I'm a very organized person and room was generally very tidy when I went out every morning, so this shouldn't be an issue). On 1st day, I had my coffee in a cup (two were in the kitchen). Housekeeper took it but didn't replace. On 2nd day I had my coffee in the second cup. On 3rd day, I didn't have my coffee because there were no cups left (never replaced). That's all. Maybe they're not big issues (I've said it). But I asked myself what I would have thinked, after paying 1800$ nt for a suite, finding a full trash bin reentering in room and other things noted (and my 1400$ total for 3 nts weren't that bad too to deserve this...).", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubrovnik, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cIn love with this place...\u201d", "Author": "Morlaque", "ReviewID": "UR22477486", "Content": "We arrived at 1 AM from JFK and it was just fantastic feeling to know that we are staying a great place like this hotel!

Flight staff were more interested in talking about what they were going to do when they got there rather than service the passengers..plus they looked in the most part like they had just left school and should be with an adult. Food was BAD, one glass of water was offered the whole trip, plus i got 1 can of drink the size of a mixer, pressing the buzzer was pointless and when people started to queue down the aisle for water they put on the seatbelt sign and made everyone sit down... Was VERY glad to get off the flight. HOWEVER this is not about the flight unless your from the UK.. So onto Vegas.. On arrival Virgin Holiday rep made us queue up for 5 mins then gave us a letter explaining all about the welcome meeting which we always avoid..we were then told to get a cab as they didnt do transfers, waste of time that was..Cab to the hotel was easy to sort out, a short (avoid the tunnel) trip later we arrived. Like many others we assumed the 4 seasons was a hotel alongside the Mandalay bay...well its not its the 5 floors ABOVE it..??!! We were welcomed in a warn friendly way, helped with bags and were made to feel special.. Check in was fast, we were offered a bigger room at $175 a night more but declined. We were taken straight to the room and it was ready, but then we did arrive 4 hours late.. We have stayed at several of the best hotels in Vegas and this has the edge on being smaller, friendlier and generally MUCH BETTER than any of the others. The only other hotel which I would ever consider would be the Venetian which has much larger rooms.. The Four Seasons has its own entrance, no casino, it's own pool, etc., but guests have access to all of Mandalay Bay's amenities. It has a spa and a restaurant which we ate in and found to be very good. A private lift to the Casino gave access to the Mandalay bay and all the shops.. My wife says that although the shops were very similar to each other in the hotels Caesars palace were the best. Getting around.. There is a train that goes to the Luxor and Excalibur. From the Excalibur cross over to the New York then to the MGM via the a couple of walk ways over the roads. From the MGM there is another train that goes the length of the strip and right to the convention centres. This train you have to pay for and its worth getting a pass. I would like to point out that our room at the 4 seasons was SPOTLESS, the room was cleaned every day, clothes that we left out were folded...The bathroom stock of shampoo etc was added to every day and we had loads of towels. We ordered room service twice, it was on time, hot and good, plus not expensive..frankly the 4 seasons is a place where you can have a lovely quiet, relaxing holiday...trust me you notice it when you open the door to the Mandalay bay and see and hear the difference. checkout was fast, no queue at all..taxi to airport simple.. Decided to get a burger in the airport and so not rely on the flight food, just as well I did...it looked like a bowl of cat sick in a tin tray, it was probably the worst food I have had on a flight since a trip to Larnaca with Cyprus Air.

It was pure heaven in every respect. Because of my good fortune, I wanted to share the \"Four Seasons\" experience with my husband as he has to stay at Marriott's for business. This trip was for my business, but we had planned a little romantic escape. It is Vegas, after all. When we checked in, the valets came running and the check in went smoothly. We were told we were upgraded. I had purchased a three night stay through Hotels.com because they had a buy two nights get one free offer that was too good to pass up. When we got to the room, it seemed small and we weren't sure what the upgrade was. But, what kept my attention was the bathroom. I kept looking at spots on the floor -- especially around the commode. We were tired from travel and went to the Charlie Palmer Steakhouse, which was very nice. The hotel was very relaxed and very clean in the public areas. It is, indeed, an oasis from the Las Vegas casino atmosphere. The next morning as we got dressed to go to some meetings, the spots in the bathroom kept bothering me, so I wiped at them and it was evident there had been a male guest with poor aim that housekeeping failed to clean up after. I left some spots for a manager to look at, too, as there were plenty. My husband went to the front desk to tell them about the dirty bathroom and was told they'd send a note to housekeeping. Mind you, we did not say that there were no towels. We told them that there was urine from the previous guest on the bathroom floor. So, I started looking around and found nuts and crumbs on the carpet. I moved an ottoman and there was a peanut. It became clear that the room had been changed but not cleaned. We just hoped that the sheets had been changed. We called the front desk again and asked for a manager to come and look at what we were looking at. A manager did come and was very responsive and said we'd be moved, which we were to a slightly nicer, but much cleaner, room. We also were sent a small dessert and a note from the housekeeping manager. Frankly, we should have been moved immediately when my husband went to the desk and not after a second call so that the manager could come view the debris of the previous guest. On leaving, I was asked about my stay and I replied that it was OK. Then, a manager was called to give her apologies. This is what really left a sour note. I told her I was disappointed by the initial reaction that the bathroom had not been cleaned. She asked me why I waited a day to call and report it. I told her that I kept thinking there was no way that would be urine on the floor -- this was the Four Seasons, after all, surely that can't be. I didn't mention that I was extremely tired because I had been in the emergency room the night before with my parents who were in a car accident. So, instead of apologizing and letting me go on my way, she put the responsibility for my unclean room back on me. That's when I became angry at this situation. I just spent a lot of money to have a \"Four Seasons Experience\" and had to walk on the urine and crumbs of the previous guest -- and maybe sleep on their sheets. Ugh. And somehow this was my fault -- because I didn't point out their inadequacies sooner? Instead of filling out a comment card, I wrote the manager of the Four Seasons Worldwide. I got a response within an hour of my email and my stay was refunded. I was asked if I wanted to stay again at the Las Vegas Four Seasons, which I didn't because I won't be traveling there again. I would have preferred a stay at another Four Seasons location, but was told that the offer was non-transferrable. So, in the end...the very end... I was repaid with money. But what 's more valuable is my time. I would have preferred another stay at another Four Seasons because I am 1 and 1 with the Four Seasons.

Right from check-in, we were pleasantly surprised. The staff who checked us in walked us to the elevator to show us around. When we arrived there was a happy anniversary cake and card waiting for us. Our room overlooked the pool and mountains. You could see a part of the airport but I only heard a plane once, not inconvienient. Bed was as good as our Sterns here at home. The furniture was nice and heavy, very well made. Loved the understated \"feels like home\" not overwhleming decor and the fresh flowers around the property were amazing. Toiletries were rich and abundant. Turndown service was comforting w/ water at our bedside, soothing music, and nice slippers. I called one day for extra bar soap, explaining that it wasn't needed until evening time and within 10 minutes two bars were delivered to our room with a smile. The same soap sold in the gift shop for $9.00 a bar! Pool was beautiful and true to reviews the staff was perfect. Drinks were not too pricey $10.00 crown and worth it. I even got spritzed, just like the reviews say! I was a little skeptical about this but what the heck, I had to do as part of the FS experience. They also sent up a cake for my birthday and when chamber staff saw it was uneaten, sent up a 2nd one the next day, so we could enjoy a fresh cake when we were ready for it. Great friends from work called up and ordered chocolate covered strawberries for my birthday and a card. They were perfect and they mentioned how sweet the staff was on the phone. We had bruch at the Verandah on Saturday and it was over $90.00 for 2 including tip. Pricey and while the food was good, the breakfast at Mandalay Bay was just as good. Every staff member was warm and friendly beyond expectations. The price overall was worth it and my husband now doesn't even want to try out the Wynn or Bellagio which we'd heard so much about. BTW since this hotel is on Mandalay Bay property I'd like to mention the casino staff who was excellent as well. We left some pics from the Stratosphere on the casino floor and realized it the next day and they had been turned into lost and found and were back in our hands after eating lunch. All in all a perfect trip. I will say this, FS is a hell of a walk even w/ monorail, and tram service from Excalibur/Luxor.

Our Strip Room was very tastefully decorated (not super flashy or oversized but perfect for our requirements). The registration and concierge services were extremely polite and helpful. The pool was perfect - a nice size with amazing pool staff who catered for our every need from constant iced water and evian face spritzing to smoothies and popsicles.

Bathroom was immacuately clean, luxury L'Occataine toiletries......nice touch!, Gorgeous, powerful shower, big bath, the expected fluffy towels and robes. Brilliant wardrobe space.

We walked over to Mandalay pools twice and turned around immediately realizing there was no service, no shade, no comfortable chairs and no quiet. Although the Four Seasons pool area was crowded each day, I always found a chair. I understand they are expanding the deck so more people will be able to be poolside. There is only seating for 100 and they told us there is a wait list to have a lounge chair at the pool in high season. Although, once you have established your lounging seats expect the finest service ever...cold towels, pitchers of iced-lemon water, popsicles, fresh fruit, cucumbers for the eyes, face misting, eye glass cleaning, magazines....service, service, service but never did it once feel over the top like I was being huddled over or bothered like many other 5 star properties. These servers have it down pat! The spa and gym are fabulous and the gym and locker room come as complimentary even if you do not use the spa. It is loaded up with ammenaties and state of the art equipment. The showers are excellent. You may not use your own hoel room to shower! I had six different spa treatments and all were wonderful! Heather was a fabulous massage therapist and I wish I could remember the other therapists names, they were all good. The rooms were cozy and pristine. The Verandah restaurant was wonderful for breakfast and the server Leo deserves major praise. He remembered things you liked and desired from other visits....what a memory, what excellent service he provided! Each day was a wonderful experience. Getting to the casino is a breeze, Mandalay has a lot of play just downstairs but hop in a cab for action down the street if you desire more. Also a tram will take you right to New York New York and the MGM. It really is not out of the way to go to other hotels like previously mentioned reviews. At most hotels you would use cab service for going to other strip locations anyway, especially in 107 degree weather. It boggles my mind that people complain that this hotel is out of the way. The sushi bar in the MGM is great and the Italian restaurant in the Venician is excellent. I do not remember the names. The only restaurant we were not crazy about was Shanghai in Mandalay Bay. Service was not up to par and the food was rather blah and boring for that type of restaurant. Decor was lovely however. The Four Seasons Charlie Parker restaurant was closed for renovations, otherwise we would have tried it also.

We figured if the room was ready great, but realistically planned to leave our bags with the bell desk, go get some lunch and come back in a couple hours. (check-in time is 3:00) They apologized that the room wasn\u2019t ready, took my cell number and off we went. They called right at 3:00 to tell us we were good to go. When we got back they apologized again for the \u201cinconvenience\u201d and went ahead and upgraded our room. Calling this room an upgrade is the understatement of the century. It was more like an apartment. Quite a treat, but completely unnecessary, especially when they were technically not even late. That evening we returned to our room to find a hand written note again apologizing for the inconvenience along with some chocolates. Then again at check out they apologized about our room not being ready when we checked in. We originally figured we would wander over to the MB pool complex at some point to enjoy the lazy river, wave pool, etc. But after one walkthrough over there we never strayed from the FS pool. Everything that has been said is so true. You are walked to your choice of location, shade, sun. Padded chaise. A pitcher of water with glasses is delivered immediately. There are servers around whenever you need them, but not hovering either. We had breakfast at the pool each morning and stayed until noon. At no point were there chaises unavailable for arriving guests. The thing that I kept being reminded was how the FS is a contrast to everywhere else on the strip. Never waited more than a minute or two for a cab. Other properties had cab lines that were so insane we just walked. Never waited at check-in, check-out, or at the concierge desk (which was amazing by the way). Other properties we walked through had lines dozens of people deep checking in or out at all hours of the day. The FS is quiet and peaceful and the other properties were a zoo. All that said, you literally can be in the MB casino complex as quickly as you can walk to the front desk of FS. There is an abundance of dining and gaming options. Same with the pool, if the FS pool is too tame, you walk through a gate and are at the 11 acre MB pools. The only critique of the property is its location at the very south end of the strip. We had show tickets at Palazzo and wanted to shop at the Forum shops, but a few cab rides took care of that. In no way would that deter us from staying there again. In fact, I can\u2019t imagine staying anywhere else after staying at the Four Seasons.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Coast, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, But Room For Improvement\u201d", "Author": "incguy", "ReviewID": "UR18902586", "Content": "First off, I agree with the good reviews here. If you are looking for a get away in the middle of the craziness that is Las Vegas, you can't do better. I strongly prefer it to the Belagio and the Wynn. Having said that, a few things reminded me that we're still in Las Vegas, where things aren't always quite as polished as they are at other Four Seasons properties. None of these things would stop me from visiting again, but hopefully putting them up here will help the hotel to focus on improvements for next time around: 1. Room service screwed up twice. Completely forgot a dish one time and took 30 minutes to bring it up (they did comp the meal). The second time they forgot the ponzu sauce that came with a sushi/sashimi style dish. Sounds minor, but when you're hungry you don't want to wait another 20 minutes for them to bring the sauce. 2. The business center charges $60/hr to use a computer with an internet connection. I didn't have my laptop and had to take care of a few things while there. I understand charging for the service so people don't abuse it, but come on...$60/hr??? The center is run by a third party AV service, but the Four Seasons shouldn't allow them to rake guests over the coals like that. 3. One particular front desk staffer, who will remain nameless, was not all that friendly, and tried to charge us for a half day rate on our last day, even though we'd been given a 4pm checkout when we originally checked in. The staffer should have checked the room notes carefully before telling us pretty coldly that she'd charged us-- when I alerted her, she easily found the notes, but it felt like she would have been happier being able to stick us with the half day. 4. We got upgraded to a \"Strip View\" room, so I am not complaining, but note that many of the rooms on the even side of the North wing don't really have much of a Strip view. Looking straight out the window we had an airport view. Walking up to the window and craning to the left you could see the MGM...If I'd paid extra to be in that room I would not have been happy. If strip view is important to you, ask what the view is of when they assign the room at the desk. 5. The TV's on the cardio machines in the fitness center were hit and miss. Some had too much static to watch, others had no sound on some channels. I know it's a minor detail, but the Four Seasons is supposed to be about paying attention to minor details, and this is one that should have been easy to see. 6. My in room TV didn't play sound in the PPV movie section (menu or move). Engineering came up quickly to fix it. But they could have prevented it by having houskeeping turn on the TV and listen for sound from the movie menu system before a guest checks in. On the very positive side, everything from Valet to the food to the pool service was excellent. The pool is a real standout and the manger, Haytham, from the Four Seasons in Cairo, was very kind and helpful. Everything from the roaming Evian mist to complimentary creamsicles delivered to free sunglass cleaning makes you very glad to be at a place where someone cares that much about making you happy. The spa was quiet and nice. Didn't use the services, but showers, steam, lockers and fitness center were all very good. Having said all that, the hotel was a real value for the money. I will stay again without a second thought, but I hope that the Four Seasons management reads this and addresses some of the little issues that are keeping this hotel from being at the top of the top, rather than just outstanding.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely The Best!\u201d", "Author": "Vanderneucker", "ReviewID": "UR18830635", "Content": "We celebrated our 32nd wedding anniversary with a three night stay at this hotel.

The casino and hotel lobby are reachable through three Four Seasons only elevators. On the surface, this doesn't seem like a big deal, but wait until you see the lines at Mandalay Bay or The Hotel to use an elevator. People in Mandalay's casino were complaining of a twenty minute wait just to get onto an elevator. And worse yet, an one hour line to check-in.

The truth is, The Four Seasons in Vegas is great if you are looking for a little down time. You can go spend your entire night in the casino at Mandelay Bay and then step into the FS elevator and its instantly quiet. But is that a good thing? It is Vegas, after all. It worked out well for us because I was staying with my family, that tends to be a little quieter and hates noise at night. However, if you are here for outrageous Vegas-themed suites, late night parties, etc., this place is NOT for you. Aditionally, since this place does not have a casino it is VERY expensive. You could book a much larger suite in another Vegas hotel for nearly half of the price. Then again, you would not be guaranteed this quiet.

We checked out and made the long trek to the Four Seasons (Note; If possible, use the private entrance on the other side instead of walking all the way through the Mandalay Bay. However, be aware that there are no sidewalks around the entry way). I'll be completely honest in saying this: Walking into the Four Seasons was like walking into paradise. The quiet, the beautiful ambiance, the smells. There are no casinos, people greet you at the front door and they quickly learn your name. If you have to stand in line at the front desk, the service is quick and efficient. Being that Vegas is hot, there is always bottled water available. Sometimes the doormen/valet will give you some after they bring your car to you, or call you a cab. Talk about service! The hotel set up is a little strange; The lobby and so forth are on the ground level, and there is another level that will take you to the door that leads to the Mandalay Bay Casino (for those who want to have easy access). The room floors don't start until floor 38 or so, and the main floor elevators have a side door that leads to the Four Seasons private pool. Inside, is just gorgeous; marble hallways, subtle beige tones; it's like walking into a mansion. Rooms are large and comfortable and my favorite part about staying at the Four Seasons is that they have Turner Classic Movies! Hopefully if you are a classic movie fan (who finds this info useful!), they will still offer this station! The bathrooms aren't huge, but they are spacious, with tubs, a fairly good-sized shower, robes, a vanity section with a magnifying mirror and double doors to the bathroom for total privacy; as well as a separate commode area. The last time we stayed here, we were given (without asking) a room with an incredible view of the strip. Just amazing. I could have stared out the window for hours! The pool is wonderful and I have learned from other reviews that there are special amenities available, which I will definitely inquire about. The nice thing is that the employees will find you some chairs, drape the towels over them for you, and generally give you whatever you need. The only thing I don't like about the pool is that (like Mandalay Bay), it closes at 7pm. However, the spa is open until 9pm and it deserves it's own paragraph! The spa use at the Four Seasons is FREE (except for of course, treatments and massages, etc), if you can believe it. Something Free in Vegas! Last time we took advantage of it after a long day sightseeing at Hoover Dam. The pool had already closed, but we took a change of clothes and went down to the spa where we took showers in the huge individual shower rooms. The showers have amenities like shampoo, soap, conditioner, you can get razors, feminine products, q-tips, cotton balls, moisturizer... almost anything you can think of. It's here. There is an area that has vanity mirrors where you can sit down (in the plush robe that you get when you ask for a locker key-even slippers and a towel!), and they have hair dryers, hair gel, etc. There is even a couples lounge which is wonderful for husbands and wives. Just ask the attendant to show you the way. Once inside, the lights are already dim (to the point that I could have slept for days in there), and very soft music plays in the background. There are magazines available to read, and I must mention the steam room with its eucalyptus steam. Absolutely heavenly! This is the ONLY place I will stay when I am visiting the Las Vegas area and plan on spending time on the strip. Need I say more? It's SO worth the splurge!

Instead of the play by play, this time I\u2019ll just hit the highlights. We stayed at the Four Seasons from June 10-13. Four Seasons: My wife was looking for a great pool, I was looking for gambling. With the Four Seasons we got both. You get the use of all the Mandalay Bay facilities, with the exclusive use of 4S\u2019s. We have stayed at other 4S properties and hoped that the service would be as good in a city known for great service...it was even above par for a 4S standards. Room: We had a regular room reserved but I accepted the offer to upgrade to a strip view suite for an extra $100 per night. The suite was really impressive, with two sitting areas, marble entry, and a walk-in closet that is bigger than our closet at home. The room also has a coffee maker, which was nice for first thing in the morning. Some of the reviews mentioned that the room was looking dated and not up to the 4S standards but ours was not. It had a very nice ~50\u201d plasma and the furniture and linens were in new condition. When we were called to be notified that the room was ready, by the time we got up to the room, our bags were already delivered. Nice touch. The view. It was on the 37th floor, windows ran the entire width of the room, and faced directly north up the strip. Best view I have ever had in Vegas, and I\u2019m usually one of those people that says view doesn\u2019t matter. Pool & Fitness Center/Spa: This part of the hotel was very important to my wife but we both ended up using it a lot. First, the fitness center amenities are complementary. The biggest deal about this was that I got to use the eucalyptus steam-room before hitting the pool. I never used one of these before but it did wonders on my hangovers. The pool staff were every bit as attentive as the rest of the hotel. Even though the pool is not as big as the MB or other strip hotels, the pool covers, ice water pitchers, popsicles, frozen fruit, and evian spritzers made up the difference. All of these were free but the normal pool bar and food menu was available. We ended up having breakfast each morning at the pool.

The TV actually would not work when I first got there and they had to send an engineer up, but he fixed it very quickly and it was OK the rest of the trip. They have some system called NXTV which is some sort of interactive thing, I was not impressed with it and I think it made the TV act up a little.

The Four Seasons has the top four floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel, and as a result is very quiet, there is no gambling at the hotel ( which means it is a haven of tranquility ) but has the advantage of having access to the facillities of the Mandalay Bay Hotel - notably the huge swimming pool with the wave machine and Lazy Man's river which the boys adored. The service was excellent from the moment you walked in the door - with water on arrival to counter the 115 degree heat. We were a little early to check in but they let us have one room immediately and phoned us a soon as the other room was ready. The children's bathroom had alphabetical sponges in each of their names, laid out in their bathroom, and on returning to their room in the evenings they were provided with Coca Cola and Popcorn - not quite what you wanted them to have a bed time but a nice touch nevertheless. The concierges were incredible and had every possible information at their finger tips and were able to book shows instantly - I would say the best concierge we have ever experienced.

I've read many reviews regarding the FS Vegas location and agree on most comments. Room: The rooms are bland (if not borderline dull and a little outdated). We had a premier strip view delux room. Only 1 sink in the bathroom with separate toliet closet, and nice shower. The room was large with a 46 inch flat screen lcd television. But the furnishing was outdated and the bed wasn't all that comfortable at all. I rate the room B+ Room Service: I called down for espresso shot and cappuccino and the room service attendant was rude. He implied that the wait would be long because they were backed up. And said something along the lines of \"if you really want coffee, it'll take 25-40 minute\". I asked regarding if they had pasteries with my coffee and what kind and he said \"yes but we don't really have time\". This kind of answer is horrible. I rate this a F Location: Although most people like the fact that it is not a casino resort, that was really one of the turn offs for us. You come all the way to Vegas and then you want to be in a non-casino destination? Well, perhaps you should go somewhere else then. We've stayed at the Ritz Carlton Lake Las Vegas resort and it beats this resort hands down as far as \"non casino\" resort and the tranquility of it. This resort is not kid friendly either. There is no kiddy pool or services catering kids. I rate the pool -- B Price: Our price on a Saturday evening for a premier strip view room was $525. Not cheap considering the Wynn had a parlor Suite at $499 during the same time and the Bellagio had a Penthouse suite listed for $599. The FS Vegas resort is by far one of the more expensive hotels in Vegas. I rate the room -- F. Service: Other than the fact that room service stinks, the bellman was nice, valet was efficient and informative, he front desk was professional, and the concierge did what was asked. So A++ for service and professionalism.

To start with the \u201cMountain\u201d view is really an Airport view. We tried to take a nap when we first got there, but there were very loud construction noises. The staff claimed it was from the Mandalay Bay over 10 floors below us. We found it hard to believe that the sound could be that deafening that many floors away. The staff claimed there was nothing they could do about the noise, nor did they offer any solutions. I asked if they could give us another room and claimed that it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. When I questioned this a little further, they said they would look into getting us a quieter room and never followed up. Fortunately, the construction only lasted for 2 days. Also, the air conditioner made a high pitched squealing noise that could not be fixed. The housekeeping staff didn\u2019t show up the second day after numerous calls to the staff. We engaged the concierge for help with a sold out concert. I questioned the price of the tickets they were quoting me, went on line, contacted the very first ticket broker in Las Vegas I found and got the same tickets for $150 less than what the concierge quoted us. We ended up extending our trip by one night since we wanted to attend this concert, instead of going to another hotel, which we should have, we simply stayed at the Four Seasons one more night. When we returned from the concert late that night, neither room key worked. When we contacted the front desk they acted as if they didn\u2019t know what we were talking about. When they actually looked us up in the system and realized they had made a mistake they sent security up to our room to let us in. Security insisted on walking into our room with us like we were con artists and were not apologetic. After security was satisfied it was our room and that we had in fact extended our trip, they said they would have 2 new room keys delivered to our room. We waited for about an hour, no room keys showed up, we decided to go to the casino on last time before we left Vegas. A couple hours later, we returned to the hotel, went to the front desk for a room key. When we got back into our room, guess what, no room keys had been delivered. Overall, the facilities were sub par, but the staff was terrible. We were nothing but understanding with the staff and they seemed to have a contagious attitude of indifference. When we checked out the next day, I pleasantly handed the individual helping us one of my business cards and ask that the GM contact me for some feedback since speaking with other mangers didn\u2019t seem to have any impact. They ensured me I would be contacted that day. I have yet to hear from anyone at the hotel. I would not recommend staying at the Four Seasons.

Surely they could provide them for FREE!!!! Its extortion of families of the worst kind!

It felt very relaxing and tropical.... a far cry from the thumping music and crowded scene at the Mandalay pool. The nice thing about being at the Four Seasons is that you have the option of sitting at the Mandalay Pool Area but the Mandalay guests can not come to the Four Seasons pool. At the pool at Four Seasons you get very comfy lounges, shade or sun, pitcher of ice water with lemon, chilled towels, Evian spritz, fruit bars, and option of ordering at the bar or poolside for food/drinks. Room was great, very tastefully decorated, excellent turndown service, comfy bed, and awesome L'Occitane bath products. I ate breakfast at Verandah (Four Seasons restaurant) both mornings and was not dissapointed. It was very relaxing/tropical feel. Of course breakfast prices are higher here but do not let that deter you as you will be eating in a very comfortable environment on real silver(!) and will have exceptional service. It does not have the hurried and crazy vibe of eating in the casinos. I am only sorry we could not stay longer. Thank you to the kind gentleman at the door Monday evening who took my husband and I to Capital Grille in the Four Seasons house car. Very much appreciated!

I said the room was just too far for her.

Anyhow we finally got our room nearly 2 hours after arriving and all we were given was two small bottles of water. The hotel is lovely and the staff friendly apart from one particular receptionist who was very unhelpful. A warning - they shut the pool some afternoons with no notice because of private parties. We had just got back from shopping and went down to the pool. We were told it was closing in half an hour. I could not believe it. Had we known we would have stopped in the afternoon and sat by the pool in the morning. Another UK couple was caught out by this too. I complained about the situation and the fact no notice of this private party had been given to any guests and we were given a free drink and they took off the bill our pool lunch the previous day. However this did not really make up for the fact that I would rather have sat by the pool. All guests had paid to use the pool and now they were selling it again to a private party. It was only by chance that I found out by speaking to the other UK couple that they had been told to wait in the bar for their room that was not ready upon their arrival and were given two free drinks each. I went back to the unhelpful receptionist who had dealt with us when we arrived and asked why that courtesy had not been extended to us and why we were just left to sit in reception waiting with our warm bottled water.

Located atop the Mandalay Bay, the hotel has a separate entrance, Lobby, restaurants and facilities. You will be whisked away into a tranquil, luxurious world- the perfect foil to the otherwise hectic pace of Vegas. Gamblers should note that this property does not have a casino, but you can easily access the sprawling gaming floor of Mandalay Bay. Rooms are pretty much what you would expect from the Four Seasons. While not as large as some of the mini-suite accommodations offered elsewhere in Vegas, you will have all the usual comforts like mini-bar, marble bathrooms with robes, and exquisite L'Occitane toiletries. Decor is rather dated, a la early 90's luxury with a tropical twist, but that should not deter you. Try and splurge on a Strip View Room, or politely ask for an upgrade upon check-in (there may well be an extra charge, but it is worth it!). The hotel boasts its' own lovely pool area, much quieter than those found at the mega-resorts. Adjacent to the pool is a small but well-equipped exercise room (free of charge unlike most hotels of this caliber), as well as a soothing Spa. Treatments are fine though a bit expensive. Staff here are eager to please- we were constantly being offered complimentary use of the comfortable chauffered sedan (please tip the driver generously ). When we had a noise-related problem (see below) in our original room, we were moved to an enormous, beautifully appointed One Bedroom Suite complete with a jaw-dropping view all the way up the Strip. We had a full bath plus a large powder room near the front door, a wonderful living room area with adjacent office nook, and a large bedroom with many closets and that awesome view right from the king-size bed. We were also offered complimentary treats which arrived periodically out of the blue.....the chocolate-covered almonds were heavenly. We loved the fact that this hotel is one of the only that welcomes dogs and met several pampered pooches in the elevators. Some pets even have their own engraved dishes awaiting them upon arrival (those which are lucky enough to stay here regularly). On site are a cafe, a fine Steak House, and a seasonal poolside cafe as well as a lounge. Guests have signing privileges at a myriad of other eateries throughout the vast Mandaly Bay / THE Hotel complex....you can also try one of the other Spas. The only problem we encountered was that when we arrived back in our original room on the first night (Monday), we discovered that above us was an all-night party complete with live dj's playing directly above us. The problem stems from the fact that above the Four Seasons are the High-Roller Suites of Mandalay Bay, and also a popular nightclub operated by House of Blues. On Mondays the entire floor becomes a wild party open to the public. By all means, if staying over a Monday, do NOT stay on the top floor of the Four Seasons (Floor 39 if memory serves). I should mention that the problem was rectified beyond our wildest dreams (see above), and that the Front Desk staff assured us they had never had similar complaints. Staying here was an absolute joy in every other respect, and we cannot say enough good things about this fine property and its' incredible staff. We also enjoyed being connected through a discreet secured door to the fun chaos of the Mandalay Bay, yet having a wonderful oasis of calm and tranquility to go to when we had had enough noise and action. I should also mention that the other usual touches one would expect from a Four Seasons stay are also here.....fine food, great service and masses of fresh flowers. There is talk of the Four Seasons eventually opening a new Resort adjacent to one of the other Strip resorts. Perhaps this particular property could use a bit of freshening-up here and there, but all in all this was one of our best hotel stays ever and is highly recommended, especially if you are fortunate enough to afford a stay in one of the palatial suites.

You will find a variety of tastes among hotels, but no hotel delivers a more dignified experience than the Four Seasons Las Vegas. Unique to this hotel, is its prime location, with few inconveniences often associated with most Las Vegas Hotels and Resorts. The Four Seasons Las Vegas is housed within the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casio, occupying floors 35-39 of this mega resort. The Four Seasons however acts as its own property, with a separate hotel entrance, restaurant facilities, pool area, spa etc. If you never left the hotel itself, you might be hard pressed to realize you were actually in Las Vegas. All Four Seasons guests have access to the Mandalay Bay Resort through several different private access doors. These access areas offer Four Seasons guest the ability to quickly walk to casino areas, shopping and other popular areas of Mandalay Bay. What's nice however is that you never have to see a casino, if you choose not to, when staying at the FS Las Vegas. The level of service was beyond impeccable, in every regard. Our every need was anticipated, met, and exceeded at all times throughout our stay. We had two connecting rooms, in the Deluxe Category, which offered views of the \"Strip\" I would however recommend choosing a mountain view, as there are less lights, and a nice view of the pool area. Rooms were classic Four Seasons in style, with extremely comfortable beds and luxurious furnishings. Since this hotel was originally opened, the rooms have been updated to reflect a more contemporary motif. The bathrooms were stocked with an abundance of amenities, along with a seamless glass shower and separate soaking tub. The Verandah restaurant was superb on every occasion. I would highly recommend the breakfast and lunch service. The pool and spa were fantastic, again offering a more private Las Vegas pool experience. You don't get the sense of overcrowding, and the level of service is in line with the rest of the hotel. The fitness center is also first class, featuring a variety of advanced machines. If your travel plans call for business or leisure, and you desire a peaceful stay, you will be delighted with the Four Seasons Las Vegas. Expect service and quality that rivals that of the competition.

They took great care of everything, including our dog. My only complaint was that they were to have a doggy pack ready for him when we got to the hotel but they brought it up later that night when we ordered room service for him. Yes - for the dog! They will make anything you want, even cut it up into the appropriate-size pieces. They give you nice ceramic bowls, Evian water and a little kit that includes plastic bags for accidents. They also had a nanny service they contracted that would watch children or pets, and we enjoyed our nanny (ask for Nancy if you have a small animal!) so much we invited her back each night of our stay. It was a bit pricy but worth it if you are afraid your pet will cry or bark if you aren't there. They do have a policy that if anyone hears your animal barking, they will be removed from your room and put in the maid's area until you return to the hotel, and you will be charged $50, so paying a bit more for someone to watch them is worth it. Other than the excellent way they treated our pet, they treated us well also. They got us into every club, restaurant and show we wanted and made sure we always had the best tables and seats. They had very comfortable beds, impeccably cleaned rooms, huge plasma televisions and L'Occitane products in the bath that were just lovely.

We had a strip-view suite on the 37th floor. Wow, what a view!! This is where we stayed on New Year's Eve and had a great view up the strip and of the fireworks. Upon entering the room, the kids were more than surprised to see a plate for each of them, with their names spelt out with chocolate on the rim of the plate, surrounding white and milk chocolate in the shape of cactus with cookies and M&M's scattered around to depict a desert scene.

If you don't gamble--and do travel with a pet--the Four Seasons is really the only choice in Las Vegas, in my opinion. (If I couldn't stay there, I wouldn't go to Las Vegas at all.) My husband and I booked a room in September, on the penultimate day of a cross-country trip, an impulse buy after the hellhole that is Rock Springs, Wyoming. Calling from our car, at the very last minute, we got an astonishingly low rate on a lovely room overlooking the Strip. I wouldn't recommend this path to everyone, but having that low, low rate in your file allows you to negotiate a pretty good deal on subsequent trips. Last night, I booked 5 nights in January for the Miss America Pageant (go, Miss Rhode Island!). The rate I got, directly from the Four Seasons for the same lovely room with a view, was lower than the lowest rate for the cheapest room on any travel Website--about halfway between the super-low rate I got in September and the first price quoted when I called. What's so great about this hotel? The staff. Either they deliberately hire exceptionally warm, kind, friendly, and welcoming people, or they put everyone through some intensive--and effective!--hospitality boot camp, who knows which? Whatever they do, it works. Everyone on the staff was wonderful: reservations, parking, bellmen, desk, housekeeping, room service, concierge. (I didn't have time for the pool or spa.) From check-in to check-out, we did not have a single bad encounter. Also (if this matters to you) they really like dogs and do everything possible to pamper them. Even behavior that annoyed me--like a woman who let her pooch off-leash and played ball with him in the elevator lobby (you know who you are, lady with the chihuahua!)--was met with genial amusement by the Four Seasons staff. The giant Samoan security guard was not a charmer, true. But he certainly made me feel secure! We had only one tiny complaint. About an hour before we planned to check out and drive to Santa Barbara, I got the bright idea of ordering a picnic lunch. The Four Seasons does offer delicious-sounding box lunches, but you have to order them 3 hours in advance. Which, for most people, means having the bright idea the night before. (Unfortunately, I am not one of the Organized People.) Room Service would not make an exception, no matter how much I sweet-talked, wheedled, and whined. They said \"no\" very nicely, but still. This meant my poor, long-suffering husband had to trudge down to the Mandalay Bay to fetch our lunch. Which turned out to be OK, but they gave it to him piled high on one of those ugly cardboard trays, so awkward to carry--particularly with a rambunctious bull terrier! Then again, at check-out, the desk guy whisked the offending tray away and returned a few minutes later with our lunch neatly packed in a lovely box. Now that I know the drill, I'll order our picnic the night before.

Not only did our check in attendant do this for us, she also gave us a double upgrade to strip view and gave us a room 3 hours before check in. Wow! Be sure to spend some time relaxing at the pool.

However, it was so crowded there, we could not find a lounge, and we walked around for 20 minutes trying to find towels. We did not stay at the manalay pool for long, we were so glad we could escape to the four seasons pool. We enjoyed the poolside menu, although it was pricey. We ordered one entree plus a side of fries and shared to help strech the dollar. We tried the sweet potatoe fries, they also had some parmesan truffle fries that sounded really good too. It is not on the menu, you can ask for it though. the beds were really nice, I felt like I was sleeping in a cloud.

It just fell short of 5 TripAdvisior 'O's - the whys and wherefores in a moment. The fab-four facts are i) Good rooms, ii) Cool pool, iii) Super service and iv) Casino-free but easy to use Mandalay Bay one if you feel the urge. It was our second stay here as a family of five (three children aged from 10 to 16) and we arrived after a 10 hour flight from the UK. We'd booked two connecting rooms, with a good discount off the second room, a $50 per day voucher for extras (about two breakfasts) and entry to the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. At check-in we were pleased to find only one person in front of us and that we'd been upgraded to a Strip-view room. The rooms are huge with great views, even if the view of the Strip is only a fifth of the view as a whole (only mention it because if I'd paid for a Strip view I'd been disappointed it didn't fill the panorama). We'd have been happy having a twin-bedded room with a roll-away bed for the smallest child and saved ourselves $250 a night on the second discounted room, but the hotel was unwilling to budge on this one. I'd been told it was for fire safety reasons when I'd made the call to book the rooms - but we found lots of other hotels happy to oblige in San Diego, Santa Barbara and Venice Beach (one of the reasons they 4-S didn't get full marks). Okay, the other factors for just failing on 'Excellent' rating were as follows: * The Family Deal promises drinks and cookies for the children on arrival in the room - but they weren't there and we had to nudge the Front Desk to provide the items for which we were paying. * Another disappointment was at breakfast where the free re-fills of orange juice or smoothie that we had enjoyed during our last stay 3 years ago had stopped - $9 for a glass of juice IS a bit steep. You can breakfast easily enough in the Mandalay Bay Hotel restaurants - dining there is much cheaper too. * The ensuite bathrooms are beginning to show their age - plugs not working properly in the sink and fittings showing wear and tear, don't get me wrong, this is hair-splitting because they are still good but I stayed in the revamped Hilton Hotel in Sydney recently and its bathrooms are fantastic, they even have a plasma TV on the wall at the foot of the bath! On the plus side, the service at breakfast was very, very good and the beds, bedding and pillows are just the most comfortable you can find. Great job by the housekeeping staff - the room was immaculate every afternoon. The rooms are well equipped with good plasma TVs, chairs etc - but if you want milk with your coffee you have to bring your own for some reason. It's also a huge plus if you have children for them to make full use of the Mandalay Bay Hotel's beach and wave machine pool, the rapids too - and it was fantastic at very busy times there to be able to retreat to the Four Season's private pool and have free ice creams, mineral water spray and even cucumber slices for your jet-lagged eyelids (I kid you not). One other observation - if you are a family of five, use the monorail from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor of Excalibur for local transport, but after that use cabs as the general public monorail system is a ludicrous $5 per person and $25 gets a taxi to take you most of the places you want. We stayed three nights and it was a great way to get over the flight and we loved every minute.

We arrived early and were checked in immediately to our booked strip view room. I agree with some other coments here that the room was maybe a little bit tired in terms of decor. However the view down the LV strip was incredible from the 36th floor south strip location. (The counter to this is that it is too far to walk to the other attractions so be aware the you will have to cab it to and from the hotel to everywhere else in LV).. The breakfasts we took in the Verandah restaurant were superb with good service (we did not eat in the hotel in the evening). At the pool we received excellent service with all the freebies that have been mentioned before by very attentive and relaxed staff. The pool area was however very busy and I could no way describe it as a relaxing experience. Screaming kids were aplenty and sorry to say that the FS tends to attract the loud brash types who are eager to tell the world what they are doing and thinking in the loudest of voices without any regard to the tranquility of others. This is very offputing and will be important for me in considering another FS resort hotel.

The Four Seasons Las Vegas met our high expectations of Four Seasons properties around the world and like other of their properties, they have recreated the wonderful rooms, facilities and location but really created an exceptional experience by their premium level of service accorded each guest. My expectations, in general tend to be high for Four Seasons properties and my wife and I tend to choose them regularly on our holidays because of our good experiences around the world. I was a bit apprehensive about this property in light of some of the reviews I had read about dogs on the property and my experience with Las Vegas hotels in general, but I am happy to say all of these concerns were overblown. The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas is in every way, deserving of the Four Seasons brand. More specifically, I'll break my review up into 3 sections: 1. Room - Excellent - If you've stayed in a Four Seasons Room, this will be no different 2. Location/Facilities - Excellent - On the Strip, but you'd never know if if you didn't want to 3. Service - Excellent - Just like any other Four Seasons ROOM - The room is exactly what we have come to expect from the Four Seasons. Firm beds, the same Four Seasons sheets. If I was to be critical, the one issue we found was that the pillows (while nice) didn't seem to be the standard Four Seasons fare. The bathroom contained both a shower and a tub, thought the shower seemed a bit small (I bumped my elbows on occassion shampooing) though functional. If you've stayed in a Four Seasons room before, this room should offer no surprises. LOCATION/FACILITIES - As our primary purpose for our visit was to visit relatives and see sights outside of the city, the Four Seasons location was perfect. Located on the top floors (35-39) of the Mandalay Bay hotel, the hotel is located at the end of the Las Vegas Strip and accessible to the airport (a short drive) and the highway (right around the corner) without having to deal with the terrible traffic that plagues the Strip around rush hour and the evening. The pool, while simple, was an oasis. You'd never know that right over the wall is the gigantic Mandalay Bay wave pool (which Four Seasons guests have access to should they choose). Even over the 4th of July holiday, we had no problems getting lounge chairs, etc. In the evening, when they close the pools (7 pm) there is a nice private walking path open to hotel guests (of the Four Seasons and Mandalay bay) only which we walked with our kids on in the late evening to get them over their jetlag. A great alternative than having them wander the Strip or in a casino. We did pop over to the Mandalay Bay a couple times during our stay to go to restaurants and a casino. The Four Seasons has several access points into the Mandalay Bay including a private access for Four Seasons guests directly into the Mandalay Bay lobby from the Four Seasons guest elevators. So there's no need to worry that you'll need ot take a cab or a long walk to the casino if that's what you'd like to do. There are a couple of restaurants on property, but we only ate at Verandah, essentially their coffee shop next to the pool. Food was fine, though the service staff and kitchen seemed a bit stretched when full during the 4th of July holiday. As a result, our breakfasts on that day took about 30-40 minutes to come out. The manager handled it nicely, though, offering a plate of freshly sliced fruit for the family until our food arrived. SERVICE - End to End service was exceptional, even for a Four Seasons, in my view. When we arrived, we were brought to our room by a guest services who noted when we wanted our rooms to be made up each day and when we preferred turn down service (and indeed, service was provided on the dot!). In addition, with 4 children, the provided milk and cookies each night and, on the day we arrived, spelled each of our children's names in colorful sponges on the bathtub which made bath time that much easier for our smaller children. If there was one criticism, like the restaurant, the valet service seemed a bit overwhelmed during the 4th of July weekend.

We liked the dinner buffet at the Wynn Las Vegas. The pool was nice and poolside dining is from the Verandah. A standard touch is a pitcher of ice cold water and cups when they set up your chaise. The Mandalay Bay pools were fun but didn't seem particularly clean- you could see the sand and feel the grime in the lazy river. And the wave pool activates once every 30 seconds as opposed to going for 6 minutes, stopping for six minutes and going again and the bottom is rough enough to scrape up body surfers so you might wear a shirt for that activity. If you like good service, I'm not sure you can beat the FS. The doormen and bell captains were EXCELLENT. The lobby greeter was helpful (I asked if you could charge dining items at Mandalay Bay to the FS-- you can, but you should bring a credit card if you intend to rent or buy an inner tube) and the front desk staff was FANTASTIC. The concierge staff was super helpful and helped us book tickets to Mystere at Treasure Island. They also helped my husband charge his cell phone because he had forgotten his. That's service. House keeping was also prompt and everything materially was as you would expect of a FS property. Spa was also very nice. Small-ish workout area but everything you would probably look for. Massage by Nicole was fantastic. (Visited the hair salon in Mandalay Bay and liked that very much as well.) Definitely recommend this property.

We spent 5 nights at the Four Seasons Las Vegas hotel at Mandalay Bay. Though we only stayed in a \"Supeior\" room with a king bed and a view of the pool/airport, this hotel was everything that it was supposed to be. It made for a memorable vacation that was difficult to come home from. Let's start with the amenities and service: * Pool service with escorting to lounge chairs (never a wait), constant service, free ice water, popcorn, ice pops, oranges, pineapple, glasses cleaning, etc. The pool service was an oasis from the craziness of the Mandalay Bay complex. * Free access to the spa/workout facilities. At most hotels you pay daily for this, here its complementary to guests. Want to leave your stuff in a locker while you stroll over to the wave pool at MB, use the locker. Want to workout on a treadmill before going to the pool, take a shower in the locker room before heading out. Amazing (spa services though exspenive were great). * Room was ultra-comfortable. Stinks having to come back home and sleep in ordinary bed. Never a problem with cleaning of room, would always be done multiple times a day. * Easy, quick access to rental car through valet. (There is a minor charge however) * Quiet, elegant dining at Verandah cafe (espeically Weekend morning brunch) * Though our kids were not with us, it appears that they are a very kid friendly hotel. * Every single time we bumped into a hotel employee, we were always greeted with a hello. * Though it is at the far south end of the strip, it does have quick, easy access to I-15 which is easier and quicker to drive up than the Strip itself (and quick to the airport). * Access to MB pools, but ability to get back to quietness of FS * No crowds at all. When walking through MB and especially Bellagio, I was amazed at how crowded these places where, especially the check-in area and valet/taxi area. Never ever experienced this at FS. What I basically found since FS is a HOTEL and not a CASINO, they care more about the service than the casino dollars. With good service they make you want to come back (and that is exactly the way my wife and I feel).

The concierge staff there is probably the best that I have ever dealt with. My only complaint was with the weekend brunch. It took almost half-an-hour for us to get seated for brunch on Saturday, even though it didn't seem overly crowded. The quality of the food was high, but there wasn't much selection. Our room package included a daily credit, and in hindsight, I wish we had used the credit at Charlie Palmer's steakhouse.

They were extremely nice about letting us in almost 5 hours early and gave us the best view available, but it was mostly looking at the airport and partially looking at the pool, and there was a lot of noise from the airport. The view from the room also looked straight down at the Four Seasons private pool.......you can see where this is going. Within 30 minutes we had been allowed to cancel our stay at Mandalay, move to the Four Seasons with a complimentary upgrade, no cancellation fee, and still get into our room over 4 hours early. The Four Seasons is a non-casino hotel (Mandalay Bay's is adjacent) so the difference in the noise and traffic level is dramatic. It was like walking into another world. There was no noise in the hallways, none in the room, you couldn't hear anything from the rooms on either side or above you. The room and the public spaces of the hotel are immaculate. The pool and the pool staff were amazing, exactly what you come to expect from Four Seasons and more! We really enjoyed being able to go to the Mandalay Beach when we felt like dealing with the crowd, but not having to worry about trying to find an available chair, because when we were ready to sit and catch some rays, all we had to do was take the short walk back to our private oasis with plenty of chairs, attendants to lay out your towels, spritz you with Evian, wipe your sunglasses, bring you pineapple and orange slices, and chilled towels. You can also order meals poolside and it was excellent. We have stayed at Four Seasons properties before and we were still very impressed at all levels with this location. Rooms, amenities, staff, food... all excellent. The 42\" plasma in the rooms was impressive also. We WILL be back.

This is what we got - the beds are comfy, the rooms quiet, nicely appointed with up-to-the-minute furnishings (updated from when we stayed here last year), the floral arrangements in the public spaces are incredibly lush and fragrant, the baths are spacious and chic, and the service on par with a 5 diamond property. We were always welcomed back by bellmen, maids, concierge, various managers and front desk managers. We were asked by several how we were enjoying our stay. I can't say enough about the quality of the food. We are definitely \"foodies\" from the SFBay Area, and from the room service breakfast, to a catered affair in one of the meeting rooms, the food was all first class and exceptional. (In particular, at the catered dinner there was a salad that came atop a mushroom-filled ravioli that was to die for). Indeed, there are countless food choices in and around town, but you can feel comfortable ordering from any of the facilities in the hotel that you will get exemplary food choices, though expensive. I can't speak to the pool facilities as we didn't use them this trip. The one downside, and this is probably due to it being Super Bowl weekend as well as Ultimate Fighting event AND a George Strait concert, was transportation was tough to come by - and I mean specifically cabs. We didn't know of the existence of the hotel's car or we would have requested it, though I doubt it would have been available. Since the hotel is behind the Mandalay it isn't approachable very easily, few cabs actually made it all the way back to the Four Season's porte cochere.

I am a lifelong Las Vegas resident and as a special evening to celebrate my engagement I booked a room at the Four Seasons. Upon check in I thought that I had used the wrong entrance and entered the check in for a kennel ( There were 4 dogs and a cat wandering the lobby ). Evidentially the 4 Seasons is the only hotel on the Strip that allows animals. We arrived just past the check in time of 3 p.m. and was told that our \" Superior \" room was not ready yet. We were offered a drink and asked if we would like to be directed to the Spa..?? After about 45 minutes I asked the desk again if our room was ready and told that it looked like it was...almost ready. Like they had a crystal ball and could see that they were just finishing up. The room was quite typical. One normal sized room, with a view of the airport. The bathroom was nice. I expected for a Four Seasons that the bedding would have been appointed with a high thread count sheet, but found it to be quite normal. I had also expected an upgraded mattress, that even Hampton Inn has now, but found a typical mattress with what looked like a thin cloth mattress pad on it. Maybe a piddle pad for the animals. There was a flat screen plasma T.V. in the room, but with no digital capabilities or HDTV all of the images were just poor quality stretched out over a big plasma. The room next door to us had some sort of a small animal in it that kept us awake during the night whining, from under the door of the room it was in. We didn't use any of the services at the hotel with the exception of the consierge who booked a reservation for us for dinner. I have been to the pool at the hotel in the summer time and it is quite and nice. I have to say that the housekeeping staff is very friendly in the halls, always saying good evening or good morning, but noticed that they only addressed me and not my future wife. As we checked out and headed downstairs, we proceeded to the desk through the beautiful marble floored hallway. We noticed as we walked down the hall, a porter standing ahead of us holding a small towel. He said nothing to us as we approached, but we quickly noticed that he was standing next to a small pile of dog poop, that we would have stepped in if we hadn't noticed it. The porter said nothing, but only seemed that he was waiting for us to pass before he bent over to pick it up. I was anxious for someone at the check out desk to ask how my stay was, but instead was just greeted with, \"well that was a short stay\". I held my tongue because all that I wanted to say was, \"it wasn't short enough\". There was never any effort to ask if everything was ok, or if we enjoyed ourselves. In closing, I will have to say that if you are looking for a luxury experience in Las Vegas, this is not the place, unless you are traveling with a pet and would like it to be able to poop on fine marble.

Once, when our TV remote stopped working, a replacement arrived less than 5 minutes after a call to the front desk. Every restaurant reservation made through the concierge resulted in wonderful seating (including Emeril's own table at \"Emeril's\" in the MGM). The maids even straighten and organize your running shoes during service. There is a house car to take you to other locations on the strip free of charge, though tipping is allowed. (You can't reserve a house car in advance, but if one is available they'll bring it around for you.) Gym: Excellent hotel gym, functionally as well as aesthetically (I like the butter-colored walls). The cardio machines are modern, with individual TVs for media hounds. The weight room has standard dumbell and resistance training equipment. The free water and Gatorade is especially appreciated during and after exercise. Food/Cafe: We had an excellent breakfast at the hotel restaurant; the corned beef hash is very tasty, as are the blueberry pancakes. There is so much excellent food to be had in Vegas, though, that we usually dine elsewhere.

The view was beautilful during the day and spectacular at night. The bathroom, bar facility, comfy bed and bed linen made our 4 nights a dream come true. Room service was informative, friendly and precise. The Four Seasons pool area was medium to large with friendly and outstanding service from the staff walking around spraying cool evian water, and offering guests orange and cucumber slices, cool ice water with lemon and cool towels. It was also a delight to be referred to by name. The other main Mandalay Bay pools were nice to have access too. They had a sandy beach in the pool area together with a wave machine and other pools. This was a lot of fun, but it was even more fun to return to the privacy and comfort of the private pool, excellent gym and relaxing spa. The Hotel was graciously designed paying attention to precise details such as inlaid marble floors, decadent flower arrangements and elegant decor. The lifts and access to Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino were within easy reach from the main lobby, along with the monorail heading north. Our only disappointments were: - HANDTOWEL RAIL WAS BROKEN - FAULTY LOCK ON DRINKS CABINET - A-1 SAUCE IN RESTAURANT,SERVED IN BOTTLE NOT DISH - NO RECYCLE BINS (COME ON PEOPLE) Once again, we will return to Vegas and most likely we will stay with our friends at the Four Seasons.

I don't care is the walls at The Hotel are gold plated you will still be subjected to the zoo at the main Mandalay pools. At the 4S you have space, service and peace and quiet. My only complaint about my pool experience at the 4S is that it is a bit too quiet for Vegas. They do not play music at the pool and I did critique them regarding this. This is Vegas and I do like a more festive atmosphere. I did not ask for G & R at 1000 decibels- anything would have livened up the place.

The meal including the dessert that they were supposed to give me appeared on my credit card with some apology. They said perhaps I just caught them on a off night! Much better choices in town. Charlie should try his restuarant sometime. He might be shocked at whats going on there!", "Date": "February 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cmore like two seasons..\u201d", "Author": "bhattdi", "ReviewID": "UR3103844", "Content": "you would think staying at the four seasons, especially in a place like Vegas, would be a most elegant experience...it was more like staying at the Two Seasons. We stayed in Vegas for New Years eve/day 2004-05 and were disappointed in the facility. Knowing that my fiancee and I were staying in a double occupancy room, they gave us one bathrobe, NO towel and old tissues/makeup was left over from the previous guest, so I question if our room was even cleaned. The next day, I left my shoes out for shining (which is a nice gesture) and was unpleasantly surprised to find out they were delivered to someone else's room (by now I'm picturing a 6ft tall gentleman wearing my size 5 max azria heels.) On our final day, the cleaning crew was leaving at 3pm and were in a rush to clean our room at 230 while I was sick in bed with the flu during this trip. They banged down our door and when we let them know that we were not ready to have the room cleaned, they called the front desk to call us and let them in.....very unprofessional. I stayed at the resort to consider it as a wedding site...now I don't think I want my funeral held there.", "Date": "February 1, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d91674-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$213 - $419*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3960 Las Vegas Blvd S</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89119</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91674", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/87/97/87974c36e8193e793a40814937904b7011large.jpg"}}

I was hunting for it in the list and couldn't find it. I had to match the address and matched the pictures. Not much has been improved here from the previous company. We had to split rooms to get two double beds in each room. We were told the rooms were not available together due to maintainance issues. The one room had a king bed and the other had two double beds. We needed them on the first floor because of problems with stairs. The king room, my room was not ready either. When my friend turned on the water faucet fell off. She was able to get it on but could not get it to work. I was going to call the office and found the phone was not hooked up. Searching for a phone jack I came across the plate for a phone jack but no phone jack. It may have been behind the headboard but I couldn't get to it. The office couldn't put us in another room. The clerk sent a handy man to fix it. He couldn't find the part and stuck a piece of meta, sort of like what you would put in a baked potato .With so many rooms down for maintainence he couldn't get a faucet off one of them? We could move itt up and back gently. The rug was dirty and there were two big dirt spots or burns? There was grafatti on the bathroom door. The toilet was also brokern and rocked. There wasn't a breakfast. Onlyt coffee was available. I would have liked to have left but the other people in our party were in for the night. The pool is closed for the season.

It was a horrible experience! The first room they tried to give us had an old musky scent, like it had not been rented in awhile. The second room had broken furniture, no remote for the TV, no working phone, no internet service, mold on the bathroom ceiling, a coffee maker, but no coffee pot. The free breakfast was horrible. No spoons for ceral, watered down coffee, no creamer. There was about 7 people in line for breakfast and only enough for 3 people. I have filed a complaint and am waiting to here back. I asked for a refund for the second night so I could stay at another hotel, and I was told no refunds are available.

For the first part of our trip, we booked in the 4 star Crown Plaza in Memphis. This was bad, and overpriced, so we booked the Ramada for our last two nights. The hotel was over the bridge from Downtown, but took only a few minutes by car to reach. It was being modernised, so the pool was closed and the corridors were being refloored. The room, however, was fine. Clean, well laid out and pleasant. The breakfast was included in the amazingly cheap price and was more than adequate. The staff were friendly and helpful.

The clerk was having a personal conversation with a man. After waiting a few minutes, I asked if I could check in to which I got a sharp \"Wait a minute.\" I waited while she dug in her handbag for money and gave it to the man explaining what she wanted. I told her I wanted to use the AAA discount and she said I couldn't because the room had been booked through [--]. We never use any of these booking agents when we travel and we do travel a lot. I explained to her that I called directly and told her the phone number I used but she refused to listen. I think this is a way to charge customers the full amount. After the paperwork was done, she handed me an envelope and I asked if there were two keys inside. Her replay was a curt, \"Of course.\" The room was dirty with spots on the walls, cobwebs, bugs, and stuff on the ceiling that looked like someone had deliberately thrown it there. The carpet was dirty, stinky, and tattered. I washed down the bathroom cabinets and entry door. There was no mini-fridge or microwave. We picked this motel because of location to a doctor's office. Since I had prepaid and would pay a penalty for cancelling, we had to stay there. When we checked out, we were told we could not have a receipt because the room had been booked through [--]. Once again, I disagreed but did not get a receipt. Pick another place to stay.

We chose this hotel because it was a great deal. The room was clean and except for the lack of a fridg, it was an o.k. room. However, on the last night of our 4 day/3 night stay, we returned to the hotel to learn the electronic keys didn't work. We also noticed that someone had been in our room and gone through our things. When we went to the front desk to find out what was going on, we were given two different stories about the keys not working and were treated like we didn't have sense enough to know that someone had been in the room while we were gone. The desk clerk eventually told us that we would have to talk to the hotel manager about it in the morning. The next morning upon checking out, we questioned it again. The manager said she had deactivated the keys because we were suppose to check out on Sunday afternoon instead of Monday afternoon. However, our reservation was for 5/4-7/07. We asked her about why someone had been in our room. She stated that she had been the one in the room. She said that because of what she thought was our check out day, she needed to get credit card information for the extra night. I asked why did she go through the room. She stated that she had to verify that someone was still in the room. I asked her why did she have to go all through the room. She stated that she had to verify someone was in the room, again. However, all of my luggage was at the door on the dresser. How much more verfication did she need? There was no reason whatsoever for her to go through our things and through the room. She didn't offer any type of an apology. Her attitude was sort of like \"I did it, now get over it.\" Nor did she give a satisfactory reason for being in our room.

When we arrived at 10:30 p.m. Friday night there was a very foul smell outside. It was similar to landfill odor. Upon check in we went to our room #207 upstairs. They have cable television however our cable connection was horrible and it was all static. I called the front desk and she said she would have to move us. My brother-in-law's remote control for the television did not work. We asked the front desk for batteries and the gentleman told us he had every battery but \"AA\". My husband used the coffee maker and it leaked all over. It is a very small coffee maker. There were two rooms near our room that did not have any door handles on them. You could see through the door handle into the rooms which did not have anything in them. On the Ramada website it indicates that this hotels is \"Newly Remodeled\" but I think it's not quite there yet. The rooms were okay. Nothing special but everything we needed except for the television not working. The hair dryer was coming off the wall. I had brought a small travel television in our vehicle so I brought it up to the room and connected the cable connection to it. But our television received the same reception. So, I determined it was the cable connection itself. We used the pool and the light at the end of the pool was floating in the water instead of being secured in the side of the pool. I brought all this to the attention of Jeff who indicated he was the manager. The breakfast was fine. They provided sausage and gravy with biscuits on Saturday morning when we were there to eat as well as bagels, toast, muffins, cereal, juice and coffee.

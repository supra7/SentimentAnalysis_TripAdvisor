The new owners, who also own the Golden Gate at the western end of the Fremont Street Experience, are planning changes to The Fitz. Let\u2019s hope they use a light touch. For those of us who need little pampering, preferring clean inexpensive accommodations, The Fitz is the best bargain in Las Vegas. Room 1215 was spacious and 100% satisfactory; in fact, at $29 per night, it was an absolute steal. I was allowed to check-in at noon, and had no trouble getting a 1 PM checkout. Every employee I encountered was professional and friendly. My room had an extremely comfortable king bed, plenty of pillows and towels and an awesome view. There was a work desk and an upholstered side chair in addition to the one at the desk. The TV was not a large flat screen, but it was fine. The bathroom was spotless, medium sized. The closet was small. There were some burn holes here and there, and I was not wild about the high pressure water conserving shower nozzle, which could not be adjusted. The housekeeping staff worked fast and was unobtrusive. Breakfast in Fitzgeralds Courtyard Grill was cooked to order and fairly priced. Don B\u2019s Steakhouse seems to be undergoing a conversion to a more casual concept. I was disappointed that a NY Strip steak was not on the menu, and my porterhouse was on the thin side, but my server went out of her way to make my meal enjoyable. The casino staff at The Fitz is outstanding. The dealers and pit bosses have a good time with you, making the inevitable losing less painful. Kudos to table games supervisor Becky and my host Suzanne. The atmosphere in the casino at The Fitz is right out the 1970s, so if you\u2019re looking for something trendier, refined or elegant, I would suggest taking your bankroll elsewhere. If you are looking for fun while gambling, The Fitz is the place. I hope the new owners don\u2019t try to make Fitzgeralds into a replica of their Golden Gate property, which is a little too hip for me. It\u2019s all but certain there will be a name change in conjunction with the remodeling and upgrading, so if you want to experience The Fitz for what it is, and what it isn\u2019t, go now. Those of us who prefer Downtown over The Strip know to expect panhandlers and the homeless on the eastern part of Fremont Street. The daytime walk down to El Cortez was dicer this time, even more so than when I was there in October, and I would no longer walk alone at night east of the intersection of Fremont Street and Las Vegas Blvd. The Fitz, though, sits in a good spot and there was amble security. The best alternative to a taxi to Downtown from the airport and back remains the public Westcliff Airport Express bus. $2 each way, and the trip takes a little less than 30 minutes: http://www.rtcsnv.com/transit/route/westcliff/westcliff(11-07-10).pdf.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGood Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Eddie S", "ReviewID": "UR123699375", "Content": "I stayed at Fitzgeralds on Jan. 13th & 14th for the second time.

Floor 34 (the top) with excellent impressive views of both the strip and the downtown area - it really was breath-taking. Room was clean and tidy (shower head moved on the wall slightly - only fault I could find) and because of the new OTIS elevators top to bottom took about 8 seconds - serious ear popping if no-one called the lift on the way down. We did both play poker in Binions however we enjoyed the slots and table games in the Fitz - everyone was really friendly. Seriously for what we paid where would you get a hotel as good as this in the UK - its cheaper that a travel lodge. Location was excellent as I knew it would be from a previous visit to downtown fremont street. We actually had a breakfast buffet one day in the Paradise buffet over in the Fremont casino - excellent value for money for only 8 dollars each. We did also eat the buffet in the Golden Nugget which was the best of the trip... Thats the thing I love about Las Vegas - you can eat anywhere. I cant review the resturants in the Fitz because we simply liked to get out and about. I love Downtown las Vegas and next time we will spend more time down there.. One word of caution tho - ask for the quiet side - we didnt and it was difficult to get some sleep whilst the excellent Fremont street experience is running every hour until 12 Midnight - only really a problem 1st night as we were tired from the 10 hour flight.

I ended up on the 20th floor. To address another complaint I have seen posted, the elevator did NOT strike me as slow at all. The room was fine for the price - clean, decent sized, appliances that all worked, and a great view. However, the air conditioner was noisy. As it turned out, the air conditioner drowned out the street noise filtering up from Fremont, so I just loaded my ear plugs and managed to sleep. I'm not much of a gambler, but I did wander around the casino. After awhile, I could definitely detect cigarette smoke and headed outside. I had breakfast in the Courtyard Grille at 7 the next morning and used a coupon that the front desk gave me. Good basic breakfast for about $2 and the service was very efficient.

The large dresser had only two working drawers and nothing in the large space below them.. The end table had no working drawer. The lack of drawer space was made up for by the three large drawers in the T.V. credenza. The in-room safe required a key, which meant that I had to have it with me constantly. Maybe if they ever upgrade the rooms, they'll install the kind that work with a touch pad, whick is much preferable. The bathroom sink had no plunger installed (??), but drained extremely slowly.

We never took advantage of the free breakfast as we don't like getting up early or standing in line, but it is available if you want it. I only have two negatives about this place. There are only a couple dozen chairs at their pool, and the hotel has over 600 rooms. You do the math. If you get to the pool anytime after 10 or 11 in the morning, you might get stuck sitting on the floor. Also, there are 34 floors in the hotel and typically one out of the four elevators is out of service.

As soon as we opened the door to our room, I knew ... This was a smoking room. Ugh!! Not only that, the room had two full size (not queen) beds! Come on!! You would think that the little girl at check in would have asked if a smoking room would have been okay. My response would have been \"ahhh, NO!\" Plus full beds?! Check in girl must have missed the fact that we are a couple and like to sleep in the same bed. I was going to ask to switch rooms, but we were there to enjoy the Bikefest festivities! Other than the fact that check in girl sucks at her job, the room was okay. Typical hotel room...clean enough, beds semi hard, one rock hard pillow and one soft one. Bathroom was large but shower sucked. The towels were tiny and there wasn't enough. We quickly showered and headed out for the night. The hotel is located on Freemont Street which makes it nice after you've had a few drinks. Upon waking up (in a separate bed than my love) with a slight hangover, we got ready and found our way to the free breakfast. I ate toast! LOL! It looked good and everyone else at the table said it tasted good. Overall, the hotel is great for the price and location. Verify your room at check in! Would we go back?

The Coffee Shop boasts a varried cuizine with everything from burgers to ribs. There is also a McDonalds and a Krispy Kreme in the hotel lobby.

For those who want a quick opinion the Fitz is a clean, comfortable hotel and good value for the money. For those looking for more details and specifics my detailed review follows. This was our 1st stay, and overall we were quite pleased with a couple exceptions, detailed below. Front desk/check in/out - very good. Our check in was handled quickly and efficiently (like 2-3 minutes), plus we got the room we booked (not always the case in Vegas). While checking in we requested a mini fridge and it was brought up to our room promptly, while we were still unpacking. Room - in a nutshell our room was clean and comfortable with a comfy bed. For the price we felt it was a good value. Just remember you are not staying at the Bellagio (plus paying little in comparison) so don\u2019t expect ultra luxury. Considering the Fitz\u2019s rates we were completely satisfied with the room. Our room consisted of 1 king bed (2 doubles same price), 2 sitting chairs and small sitting area, desk, so/so TV, iron, coffee maker, and as mentioned, mini fridge. One minor complaint was the A/C worked well but was quite noisy. We stuck a empty match pack between the blades and the unit and that quieted it fairly good. Housekeeping - excellent. We\u2019ve been to Vegas many times and we are late nighters, meaning also that we sleep late. In the past we have had problems getting our room cleaned up and restocked due to this. At the Fitz this was no problem. Despite not getting out of the room till between 2-4 PM each day our room was cleaned and restocked daily, and they did a very good job of it. We could not have asked for more from housekeeping. Pool- The pool and pool sitting area are somewhat small. I\u2019d say pool comfortably holds about 12-15 people and there are about 25 lounge chairs. There is also a 6-8 person hot tub. Pool visitors were of all ages, but learning towards mostly 30s-50s. Good music (at least for us - classic and modern rock). Pool is open till 11pm which we loved as often pools in Vegas in our experience close around 6PM. They have a limited cocktail selection which you order by phone by the pool. But you can also bring your own beverages which many people did which we also enjoyed. For us the pool was ideal as we don\u2019t like large crowds while at the pool and often there we only a 5 or 6 other people there. Depends what you want from the pool but for us it was great. Food - there are limited food options at the Fitz. There is really only 1 full time restaurant. If offers both menu and buffet services and is open approx 7AM-11PM daily. Having said that the food is pretty decent and very reasonably priced (i.e. dinner special $6.99-$9.99). They have a number of daily specials for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There is also a steak restaurant but its only open I think 3 evenings a week. We didn\u2019t try it but looked at a menu posted on the door and entrees averaged about $30. Other than that there is a 24/7 McDonalds. Staff - generally the staff at the Fitz is very good. Nearly all we encountered were pleasant and helpful and are committed to helping you enjoy your stay. Cocktail /bar service - this is a tough one to rate because it varied so much depending on who was serving. Let me 1st say we\u2019ve been to LV about 12-15 times so have lots of experience in what to expect. We are not one of those who expects a drink within seconds of sitting at a machine. We know in most places the staff work hard and that it takes a bit of time for them to find you to bring you a drink (i.e. 10-15 minutes is not unusual or unexpected). Once they find you then generally are back pretty quick. Having said all that I must say at times the service at the Fitz was very very slow. One time I was playing a table game for about 40 minutes with no service and right after went to a machine for about 30-40 minutes with no service. Another time my wife and I were both playing a table game and went about 45 minutes with no service. We got the dealer to bring the pit boss over and we asked him to check on the service. After about another 30 minutes we still had no service and were about to leave when someone finally showed up. This is not acceptable to me. At most casinos we\u2019ve been too, tables games service is very good. Also comp drinks at the bar can be very slow. One time I sat and played at the main bar for about 25 minutes without being served. This was like at 2AM and there was only 1 other person playing, so it wasn\u2019t busy. In our experience comp drinks at the bar at most casinos we\u2019ve been too is lightning quick (i.e. offered a drink anywhere from within a few seconds to 2-3 minutes). Having said that there are some outstanding servers at the Fitz, Mary-Ann, Julie L, and Joyce in particular. These ladies are quick, friendly and efficient. Most of the other servers are at least decent and serve you in a reasonable time, but there are a \u00bd dozen or so that are very slow and drag down the overall rating and can give a bad impression to the overall service. Particularly if its your first time there and you are unlucky enough to get one of the bad ones. Players club/comps - compared to other casinos we\u2019ve been to we find the comps at the Fitz are very poor. As I said we\u2019ve been to LV many times and generally we get comped rooms for our whole stay and often meals as well. Being 1st timers at the Fitz we did get 3 nights free and a marginal discount on the other 8 nights but that was it. At the end of our stay we got a shot glass (yippee!). I should add we did play less than we usually do. In part this was due spending time by the pool each day being a summer trip and all. Still the comps/rewards seemed quite low compared to most other places we stayed. In summary we would recommend the Fitz as a clean, comfortable, hotel/casino for a reasonable price. But if you find the comp bar/cocktail service too slow either complain or leave as there is much competition that is willing to offer quicker service. Finally for anyone who values comps/rewards I would recommended you look closely at what the Fitz offers and compare it to others. While we will likely play on occasion at the Fitz in the future we probably would not stay here again for this reason as we can get better comp deals elsewhere.

I stay at downtown hotels every year when I travel to Vegas twice a year. This year was no exception. I family members arrived a day before me, so I left my bad in their room when I arrived. I checked in to my room, but did not go up right away. We decided to go to lunch first. About 4pm, I finally went up to my room. The bathroom had barely been cleaned since the last guest. I had dirty towels on the shower curtain bar. There was so much hair in the tub that you could tell it had not even been rinsed. There were fresh towels, and new soap but that was about it. I went to the desk to tell them about it, and they called housekeeping to come reclean it. They did, it looked and smelled clean. The following day, phone books were left in the hall by each room. When leaving the room, the housekeeper yelled down the hall to me... \"Hey, you better bring those phone books in before you go.\" All right, fine. I was going to bring it in anyhow, but to have the staff yell at you like it is your job is not reasonable. On my final morning, a knock came at the door at 8:15 am. I heard the yell \"Housekeeping\". 8:15 am on a Saturday, in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is not a town of early birds, it is a town of night owls. I groggily yelled back.... \"I am leaving today, and check out time is noon\" She replied.... \"Well if you can get ready early let me know, we have someone else checking in to this room\" Ok... don't value the guest that is there. Just try to hurry and turn over the room for more cash. Thanks for making me feel like a valued guest on my very last day ever in your hotel! I told the desk manager about this... a different one than the one I told about the dirty bathroom. She seemed concerned. But not enough to offer a free night on a return stay. I was not trying to get something, but don't you think they would try to encourage me to give them one more try? All this would not be so bad, but I had problems with housekeeping last year too. It was way below standard. When I checked in my room last year, the package to the soap had yucky mold all over it. The air vent on the wall had a quarter inch of dust, like it had not been touched in weeks if not longer. Having stayed there before, the standards certainly have dropped.

My room was large and the bed comfortable. The window is large and, while you don't see the glorious shiny strip, I had a view of the mountains and at night the housing developments you could see provided some shininess. I like their casino and the cocktail waitresses were more available than in most casinos I visited during my trip. The staff I encountered were all very friendly and helpful. One of the good things about the Fitz is that they are very generous with offers for very little play. I'd have to work up to being considered a low roller and even I get offers for two nights for the price of one. This includes weekend nights. It also came with show tickets (Fitz of Laughter) and coupons. It's a pretty basic room. The TV is old style but it was a decent size and it worked well. The hot water worked fine in the shower but the water pressure wasn't great. Not terrible but not great. There were plenty of towels. Internet isn't free although I understand there's free WIFI at Krispy Kreme. The only other restaurant there that I ate at was their one on the second floor. I think it's called Garden Court. It was okay (especially with the coupon at check in) but I wouldn't make a big effort to go again. The good thing about downtown is that you're not very far from anywhere else downtown. Four Queens is next door and their cafe, Magnolia's, is very good and open 24 hours. There are several other places to eat that are very close. I'd advise you to go afield for eating but then come back to the casino to play. I'd often heard complaints about the elevators there but that problem seems to be fixed. I never had to wait very long for one to arrive and the ride was smooth. I've stayed at two other hotels downtown in previous trips and I now consider the Fitz to be my downtown home. It's nothing fancy but it's comfortable, clean, safe, and economical.

I expect certain things but I'm also more leniant when it comes to problems because I've been on the other side of the desk. When my parents and I checked in, the FD did a great job of meeting our requests and blocking us on a high floor close to each other. So far so good. As soon as we got to the rooms we examined the beds for bed bugs. Room 2430 was good to go. Room 2424 was infested. I actually conduct the training for my housekeeping department so I know what to look for. I had instructed my parents to not unpack for this very reason and immediately called housekeeping. The supervisor who came up was dumbfounded that I even knew what to look for and challenged me on my findings. She immediately recanted however when I produced the \"evidence\". My parents were moved to 1623 which was bug free. I strongly recommend that any traveler who reads this Review become educated on checking for bedbegs. It doesn't matter if you're checking into the Ritz or the Fitz...as long as people continue to travel there is the possibility of bed begs. I asked that the Front Office Manager call me the next day to discuss the issue and Dawn (manager on duty) did just that. She was extremely apologetic and empathetic and handled the situation beautifully. We were treated to a dinner at Don B's and thouroughly appreciated her generosity/follow through. The rest of the stay was uneventful and relaxing. We made friends with the Craps dealers Herman, David and Lana as well as the pitboss Patrick. Their professionalism and personalities really helped us to enjoy the weekend and we would come back specifically to see them again. The morning breakfast was decent and dinner at Don B's is definitely a must do. Overall (minus the crawlly friends) the rooms were comfortable and accommodating. Water pressure in the showers is AWESOME! The purpose of this review is not to scare you away from the Fitz...like I said, you can unfortunately encounter bed bugs these days at almost any hotel. Moreover it is to praise the team for how they handled the situation and to definitely recommend them for their service. The location of the hotel is perfect if you enjoy freemont street and their staff is well trained on service issues. Because of this we will still consider Fitzgeralds again when traveling to Las Vegas", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value Downtown\u201d", "Author": "lockerroom66", "ReviewID": "UR94303710", "Content": "Stayed Jan 19-23, 2011. Likes and comments: STAFF are friendly and helpful; housekeeping does a great job daily in keeping the room clean and towels changed. Security present but not threatening. ROOMS are basic, but clean; The bathroom has a long vanity, hairdryer, decent toiletries; the towels were functional, but not plush. Our room had 2 double beds, a dresser with 2 drawers, a TV cabinet with 3 drawers, a nightstand, and a table with 2 chairs. I liked the surge rotector with 5 jacks at the bedside floor - hard to find plugs in hotels. This time our room did not face freemont street and the noise was much reduced. POOL- is closed in January, but looked very clean. Hot tub was open. RESTAURANT - excellent value in the mornng - $1.99 for 2 eggs any style, diced breakfast potatoes, and toast. Add bacon or sausage for $1.99 more... the short line to get in moved quickly. GAMING - at least one $2 blackjack all day, MANY $5 tables, generally no waiting, pretty generous with their comps. DRINKS - cocktail waitresses come by frequently and drinks of good quality. Check out the Vue bar overlooking freemont street on the secon floor TAKE a side trip to the Outlets (off Charleston -very closeby), and if you're an adventurer, spend the day hiking Red Rock Canyon, about 12 miles away. DID NOT LIKE: Self parking garage - you have to park above floor 6 and garage winds round and round and is very tight. Other customers may drive too fast and BIG potential for an accident. Valet was efficient and a $1-2 tip is worth avoiding an accident!

I used the shampoo and lotion daily, and they were restocked each day by housekeeping. Fresh towels daily as well. The Fitz is comparable to The Plaza, Binion's and The Fremont, where I have also stayed in the past. It's a step up from the Las Vegas Club, which was pretty ratty the one time I stayed there. I have never stayed at the Golden Gate nor California Hotel, so can't make a comparison to those. I've read complaints from people re: various downtown hotels and if you're considering any of them (excepting the Golden Nugget, which is at the top of the list for downtown hotels), be aware that most of them have not been updated in years, perhaps decades. There is no such thing as a non-smoking room - they have all been smoked in at some point; last night, last week, last month...as such you might have a cigarette smell, a burn mark on the bathroom counter or end table...that sort of thing. They're also pretty basic and no frills. Depending on which way the room faces, you may hear noise from the Fremont Street Experience. I don't have any real complaints about The Fitz for this stay, which was 4 nights. Only 2 things bugged me a little: the bathroom sink didn't have a drain stopper (so you had to let the water run when shaving or washing up, which seemed wasteful), and the curtains were about 6 inches narrower than the window opening (so the morning light would flood the room at the crack of dawn). Otherwise, it was fine for my needs, which was a downtown place to sleep and stow my luggage. They do have an on-site pool, which looked clean and maintained, and a number of people were using it during my stay. Wifi is available for $12 per day - pretty steep. They have internet kiosks in the lobby which are likely cheaper if you just want to check email. They do have an Enterprise rent-a-car desk in the hotel, if you want to get out of town for a day (up to Area 51, down to Hoover Dam, tool around town or whatnot). Tips: I didn't eat at any of the on-site restaurants, but did discover a new (to me) diner/restaurant at the back of the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino, called DuPar's (not the cafe', but the restaurant & diner, which is a separate place). The pancakes are great, and huge - try a short stack, which is 3 pancakes but they are as big as dinner plates so plenty for one person, maybe even 2 people to share. They also had good salads and pies, but the chicken noodle soup was off - I think it had been sitting too long. If you're looking for some good old-school style Vegas dining, try The Peppermill or Carluccio's - the decor in both places has to be seen to be believed. For another funky experience, grab drinks at Frankie's Tiki Room. To save a good $40 or more (each way), try taking the #108/Paradise bus from the airport to downtown, and back again. Catch it at level zero, it costs $2, takes about an hour to get downtown (give or take - one time it took me 40 minutes, another time a little more than an hour - plan on 90 minutes and you should be fine). It lets you off at the base of Fremont, by The Golden Gate (across Main St from The Plaza), and it's about 4 blocks' walk to The Fitz. On the way back, you catch the bus on the other side of Main St (the Plaza side), next to the old train car. I've taken this bus a number of times, at varying times of day & night, and it's always been safe and cheap. If you don't mind getting the occasional mail & email offer in the future, sign up for the Casino Player clubs. Most of them have some sort of coupon book that comes with signing up, and/or they give you a little trinket (deck of cards, dice etc)...and admittedly most of the coupons aren't very useful, but a few pay off. For example, at one place I got $10 in free slot play, and while you can't cash out that $10 worth, anything you win, you keep - I ended up winning $65 using their $10. At another place I got a $20 dining credit and ended up paying only $2 for a giant dinner. The better perks come later - I chose The Fitz this time because they send out quarterly coupons - the one I used was for a free night for every paid night, so my hotel was 1/2 price this trip.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Park City, Utah", "Title": "\u201ckicked us out\u201d", "Author": "skisickie", "ReviewID": "UR78953353", "Content": "daughter took her disabled dad to the mens restroom and walked the wheelchair into him after checking to make sure no others were there.

The hotel does have internet access, but it was REALLY expensive... about $11 a day! We bit the bullet though and payed that, since we had such a great rate on our room otherwise. We didn't use the pool at all, but we did eat at the coffee shop restaurant. They have some specials, but you really have to watch what time they are. The food was ok, and it was probably one of the less expensive places to eat on Fremont St. I did a little gambling, but always have bad luck, so there's not much use on me commenting on that aspect of the stay.

The furniture had a ton of dings and needs to be replaced. The mattress expired about 3 years ago. You could feel the springs and it had bad depressions. About the only thing that was touched in this room since 1984 was the water saving shower head. The casino seemed pleasant and inviting, but the carpet was disgusting.

I have stayed at a bunch of Vegas hotels and not one of the them have been perfect when it comes to being clean. The casino and Fremont street makes for fun people watching but watch your stuff, there are a lot of homeless people at night looking for any opportunity. We actually had a very intoxicated homeless guy ask to share our drink with him. The pool area is small but there is no loud music and we pretty much had the pool to ourselves with no kids splashing. You can also bring your drinks in there (No glass). Most of the pools on the strip search your bags and allow no drinks. Then you must buy one of there drinks for $10 and up. Bad- smoky casino, basic room with hard beds, and not much nightlife on Fremont other than gambling. We try and stay one or two nights downtown and then 2 nights on the strip, to mix things up. If you take a shuttle make sure they know you are coming downtown, our driver first said $6, then it jumped to $9 once we got there.

We had move our scheduled days of departure/arrival by 1 day. Our rooms were comped through an offer we received in the mail, along with a few other perks..so we were concerned about calling to request a date change. No need. My husband called, and they had no problem changing the dates. It was simple..took about 2 minutes on the phone with friendly staff. We had to rent a car from Los Angeles to drive into Las Vegas..not our original plan by any means..but we got there. We had read about the tight squeeze in the parking garage..but as we located the Fitz, there was an easily spotted sign for valet parking..sweet! Worked like a charm. Friendly guy and took care of the car. Returned in the shape we gave it to them in! Couple of dollars later, we are at the check in desk. Also friendly easy service. Got our room with no wait at about 7:30 pm on 02/14. Gave us additional coupons to use at checkin, which we did use several. Upon checkout, room was exactly as they said..free. No resort type fees at all. Sent us off with a thank you and hope we had a nice stay. We were given the comped room on the 7th floor. It was average, as expected. The elevators, the entire stay, were Zero problems. Had read here previously that they were slow. We entered our room and it was older furniture but not tore up completely as some would say. The bathroom fixtures older, yes..but funtional. Large vanity sink area, which we like, Low flow shower head in a tub/shower combo. Yes, it was older staining but I would not say it was dirty. It was over time built up. No fan in bathroom, just the slats things in the wall above the toilet. Towels, washclothes provided were clean though not \"plush\"..but again, usable. Provided toiletries and kleenex and plastic glasses along with ice bucket. No coffeemaker as stated on website. If we had called down, we may have gotten 1. We travel with a small 4 cupper anyway, so to us, it was not a problem. In room safe worked fine. Located in closet with hangers, ironing board/iron. There was a full length mirror on bathroom door, which is much appreciated and NOT supplied in a lot of casino hotels we have stayed in. Large vanity mirror as well along with working hairdryer. Since we only had been there 1 night for a short period of time, we did not require room service the first day but did tip the gal in the hall, replaced towels ourselves and some plastic cups from her cart. Had her cross off our room, as we could not find a do not disturb sign for the door. We left our bathroom belongings out in the bathroom, tidied up the rest, locked up valuables and never had 1 single problem. We did use housekeeping the other days of the stay. Left a tip on nightstand each time and was thanked by staff when we they saw us. Room was done way before noon each time, (we transfered to strip hotel morning of 02/17) Yes, TV was older but worked fine. We were placed on 7th floor. No view really. BUT I could easliy see the digital clock with time and temp each morning at casino down the road...that was nice! The main dresser only had 2 top drawers with a wood panel that ran along the bottom where, my guess would be, broken drawrs had been removed and recovered with wood panel. The room we received was located on the side street near a concert stage. We could look to the right and see the top of canopy. Yes, it was loud. Thunderously loud when the Canopy played its screen..but that is to be expected. We were right right beside it. There was also a band playing till 11 or maybe even midnight..beside us and it too, was loud. We were in room first and second evening before those were done..early nights, and I can imagine that some people could not sleep with that going on. We, however were so exhausted the first night- the bomb going off outside the window..did not keep us awake, or wake us. I would have to say the same the second night. We turned TV up a notch as it went on..to hear the words coming from there but it IS LAS VEGAS and it can be loud anywhere. We were not high enough to avoid the noise..so I can not say that you can't hear it further up. The bed was good. Not bad at all. Pillows..flat. Our room was 2 dble beds. No king available they said. We used the pillows from that bed too and it was fine. The casino restaurants were also fine that we used. We ate breakfast at the Courtyard grill. They had a 1.99- 2 eggs, hashbrowns and toast. They also offered 4.99 steak, hasbrowns and toast with 2 eggs. (You could order bacon or sausage for 1.99 to any meal) Service was fine, food was fine..it was not dirty. We did not get to eat at DonB's steakhouse, which we regret. We had wanted to try it- and there were discounts offers given to us as well. We did use the McDonalds one morning for a breakfast to go while playing a few slots to get the morning started. Ate from the 1$ menu. We played some fun slots. Upstairs there is cash in/cash out. Thats fine..except mine ran out of nickles..and was trying get 15.00 out. Had to wait quite some time for service as the man was alone..and working with another patron, He wasn't thilled about it, slightly stressed I would say, but he did speak to us..was just trying to get his job done and move on to the next machine in need. We tried keno for the first time. We won 2.00. Used the coupon offered to us..lost 18.00 of the 20.00 but have an understanding of the game now. Bell desk was helpful to us twice. We had to return rental car to the strip the first morning and he was trying to see closest place to return the car. Then, when we were checking out, they arranged a Towncar service for us thru Exotic Limo..that got us to NYNY..without having to use a cab. (40.00 to NYNY with SUV that arrived to take us, nice driver, safe!) We used the Players desk several time and had a lovely woman, tiny- wait on us each time. We got a free shotglass with our points! Each got 5.00 play, I think..or cash, don't remember really. She was very sweet and we enjoyed her alot. Actually seemed to like her job! Gaming was OK. I didn't win big bunches but did play for a while on what I put in. My husband played 3.00 craps tables..about the same. Enjoyed some of the slots himself. I don't think we ever saw his favorite slot there- Fireball, but he found some others to keep him occupied while waiting for me in the mornings. We did both eat and drink at the Vue bar on the second floor, twice. We used a 241 appetizer coupon we had, and all the dollar drink coupons, or 241's they gave us. We sat outside for a bit the first night and watched the street below us. The food was OK..didn't rave but good. Had chx ranch flatbread pizza and chx fingers with veggies. We split each and for 8.95 or so total for both- enjoyed the TV and people watching..Bartender was a funny guy first night. I would say our stay here was just fine. The hallways were clean to our room. Carpets were not dirty in our room and had been vacuumed. We had no problem sleeping, or problems with bed bugs at all....walked on carpet in socked feet without worrying. We are average folks that stayed at an average hotel and had a fun time!

I have a personal aversion to oak furnishings, but if you don't, maybe you'll like it just fine. The person who checked me in was very nice and it was late so there was no line. The room was mostly clean except for a few hairs in the bathroom. After some extra wiping I even dared take a bath in the tub. The carpet looked a little worn and had a cigarette burn in it, but nothing was too offensive. There was a little peeling of wallpaper around the edges, but hey, it's an older hotel. The bed was clean and comfortable. I didn't use the free breakfast coupon but it's good not for your choice of breakfast, but for a very specific item (which I believe includes eggs, breakfast potatoes of some kind, and choice of sausage or bacon). The casino is run of the mill for downtown casinos -- again, nothing special. I moved to the Golden Nugget for the remainder of my stay (this move was planned in advance and not any kind of function of my like or dislike of Fitzgerald's), and there's a big difference between the two hotels. Fitzgerald's is pretty much just another rundown downtown hotel, but the Nugget is NICE. Casino is nice, pool with shark tank is sweet, and I arranged for an upgraded room which is nothing short of plush. My new favorite hotel is the Golden Nugget!

Once we were in the room, our first impression was better than the second. The music from Fremont street was so loud in the room! And that continued until midnight.

We immediately called housekeeping and then started calling around for another room in a different hotel, but it was too late by that time. We were stuck in the Fitz! An hour of terrible sounds later, the vomit was gone and we were left to sleep in the very uncomfortable beds.

We had an early flight and so arrived well before check in. The very nice gentleman at the front desk offered us a room on the 25th floor or we could wait for something lower. We chose to take the room. We had two doubles and the room was quite ordinary except for the fact that the carpets were quite stained. This really didn't bother us too much as we don't spend much time in the room and head their only to sleep. The beds were comfortable and the linens were fresh. We tipped the maid a few dollars each day and she kept our room spotless. Thanks Bok. As for the elevator situation, there were three and sometimes only two elevators working. It was a bit more of a wait on the weekend when the hotel was busiest but I don't think I had to wait more than 5 minutes for an elevator. I didn't find the elevators as much of a problem as the patrons. If there were a lot of people waiting, the rude tourists would almost push people out of the way to get on, instead of waiting their turn for the next elevator. One time I came up behind two older ladies, one with an oxygen tank on a cart. They were first in line and I was next but several people pushed their way on before this poor women who had to manuever her tank around them. Such rudeness I don't understand. I think if people would be more civil there would be less complaints about the elevators. We enjoyed the casino and the cocktail waitresses were pleasant and came around as much as I wanted them too.

In the end I stuck with my Fitzgeralds reservation with the thought that the money saved would be used for food and games. Now home after 4 nights in LV, I'm having a hard time deciding if I can recommend the Fitz even for the low, low nightly rate. Our room was on a floor that had been remodeled recently. Well, the halls had been remodeled and looked very nice. Seeing that, I was really optimistic about the place until I opened the door to our room. Our guest room had 2 double beds, an armoire, dresser and a nightstand. The \"wooden\" furniture looked a little like the kind of thing you buy at Target and put together. Not bad, but fairly cheap looking. The beds were on the low end of acceptability. The TV had a decent selection of channels and good picture. The bathtub faucet leaked continuously and looked a little worn. The A/C worked fine but was a little loud. The overall effect of the room was one of advancing age and wear. One of my biggest concerns was the elevators. I had heard of a history of long delays waiting for an elevator and how this was now less of a problem since some of the elevators had been replaced, I'm sorry to say that it is still a problem when the hotel gets busy. Sunday morning I waited 15 minutes for a down elevator before giving up and taking an up elevator and riding back down. That is really unacceptable. I did not eat in the Fitz but ate at the Four Queens and Fremont which are steps away from the Fitz, Everyone I met at the Fitz who talked about the condition of the hotel said something like \"well, for the money it's okay.\" Personally, if I had it to do over again I'd spend another $10 -15 a night for the Fremont of 4 Queens. For that I'd get a better bed, elevators that worked and in hotel restaurants that I am willing to eat in. The best part of the Fitz was the valet service.

This review was from a trip that i took at the end of may. I've been going to Vegas for the past 4 years, I find that Vegas is still the most affordable place to take vacation. The entire package was just under $800 for three people, including round trip airfare, and 4 nights in the hotel. We stayed at the fitzgeralds, this is my second time staying there. The first trip was with my dad, and we a had wonderful time as well, so good that i booked this trip at the same hotel. The Fitzgeralds is an older hotel, as many of the downtown hotels are. The room quality is good, a little worn around the edges but not dirty. I've read many complaints about the elevators, there are signs posted stating that they are in the process of upgrading their elevators. We personally weren't affected by long wait times, or over crowding of the elevator cars. We stayed on the 17th floor, and never had to wait over 3 minutes for an elevator. The staff we encountered were all very friendly, polite and helpful. The only place we ate at the fitz was the McDonalds located next to the casino. The prices there were the same as home, and they had the dollar menu. We avoided the Fitz buffet because of the poor reviews, the Main Street Station and Fremont have very nice buffets. The room was very adequate for our needs, and served it's purpose well, we were never back to our room before midnight so noise from the Fremont experience wasn't an issue. The view wasn't spectacular, but did look out to the mountains, which was nice. The curtains are the very thick \"Black-Out\" type which is great when you end up getting in around sun-rise and need to power nap before hitting the town again :-D My overall experience with the Fitzgeralds was great, The only minor thing was the narrow paths in the parking garage, very little room to move if another car was coming, and the winding up to the 6th floor was a little dizzying, but then again it's a small garage, for a small hotel. They do have a pool, however we didn't make use of it, but did see it, it's not in the nicest location. The pool is right next to the rear access road, and is surrounded by 7foot tall concrete walls, looks like a pool cell more than a pool area, and the pool was a simple square shape, but the water was clean and blue so that's a good thing :-)", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canyon Country", "Title": "\u201cDo NoT StaY HeRe\u201d", "Author": "soinluv74", "ReviewID": "UR37317260", "Content": "i booked a reservation in advance for my husband and 2 co-workers and when they showed up at 2am after a 5 hour drive, staff told them that the reservation was NoT on file.

We were staing on the 17th floor. Breakfast came with our US Air package they give you your coupons at checkin. Breakfast was served extremely fast and consisted of bacon or sausage, eggs, homefries and toast and coffee. We used the pool after breakfast before it became too hot and noone was hardly ever there. We had the pool to ourselves and it was clean. It was kinda weird though walking outside the hotel past the valet parking entrance to get top the pool, but it was nice and not crowded.

Easy to grab (but I wasn't going to put my hand down there) but not caught by housekeeping for who knows how long. Feet were black after walking across the floor. Gave tip each day and asked for extra towels the first. The next day towels were gone. Apparently have to ask for them each and every day. The good: Courtyard Cafe - and their staff. Friendly, and the Sliders were excellent! Ate dinner/the Sliders the first night, went back the next night just for the sliders, and went back for breakfast our last day. The slots were fairly loose. We didn't hit it big (though 2 or 3 people did in the 3 day span), but won enough to keep us playing. We were able to play quite a while on $20. The location was great. The Deuce dropped off people right by Fitzgeralds, and only had to walk a block to catch bus to Strip. Walgreens right across the road, so we got water, etc there when we wanted it. Overall, a decent place to play and visit, but I don't recommend staying there.

Weekends would have been $49 tops I think. I used the $20 bill trick and actually did get a room with a nice view (3348 I think.) The view rooms are basically corner rooms, and have a \"wrap around\" window. One view from my room faced the Stratosphere Tower, the other faced West. The room itself was older Motel 6 fair, but was fairly clean. Bedspreads looked and felt very used. There was a small in-room safe for guests, which I used. It was free. Maids were pretty good about keeping people out while they were cleaning the room. i.e. you couldn't just walk into a room unless they KNEW it was your room. A good thing at this hotel, as a few of the guests are a little seedy due to the low prices. I also met LOTS of nice people here during my four-night stay however, so the undesirables are probably the minority. Most people I met staying there seemed to be middle-aged. Got a player's card, which is only good at Fitzgerald's Las Vegas I believe. I played craps and some blackjack at the casino. Craps was $5 minimum and 3X4X5X odds. They went up to $10 minimum at times, but you could always stay at $5 if you bought in before they raised the limit. Nice dealers for the most part. Preferred to play my craps at Binion's however, though they had the same minimums. Another thing I liked about this hotel is the fact that the walk to the rooms isn't too terribly long from the elevator. This is because the hotel is really not that big, though it is one of the tallest (if not the tallest) hotel downtown. I was at the opposite end of the hotel from the elevator and it was a walk, but not nearly as bad as some larger hotels. The hotel is located on one end of the Freemont Street Experience (the south end I believe.) I liked this fact as it was also close to a Walgreens and a couple of gift shops where you could buy your bottled water, sodas etc. The \"Deuce Bus\" also stops just up the street on Las Vegas Blvd. They'll ding you about $13 per day for Internet, though they do have it. They also had a business center near the lobby, though I didn't use that. Overall I enjoyed my stay there. The price was right and you get what you pay for, but for those on a budget it's a great value and much better than some of the other \"cheapies\" downtown. I'd recommend the Fitz over the Plaza, Las Vegas Club etc. If you want a \"nice\" place to stay downtown, try the Golden Nugget's north tower. Usually the GN is about $100/night for north tower rooms, but sometimes they are just $79 per night.

The Fitz is about 1.5 miles from the bowling facility and seemed a good choice. We had stayed about 4 years ago and while it didn't set the world on fire then we thought it would be ok....boy were we wrong. The carpets in the casino are dirty. You notice this if you lift up the seats at some of the slot machines and see what the carpet used to look like. There are only 4 elevators to service the 34 floors and 600+ rooms. They are so slow that one routinely waited 10-15 minutes. When I approached the front desk they said that they were in the process of upgrading the elevators and that one was new and used digital processing while the old 3 used analog and they didn't talk to each other well. Indeed, the new elevator was frequently out of service. The beds varied wildly from acceptable to downright unusable. One of our group finally asked to be moved to another room only to be shuffled twice because someone apparently had kept a room key and was occupying a room thought to be empty. Other people commented about the poor quality of the mattresses as well. Our room wall heater/air conditioner failed to maintain the temperature (on the cold side) so we let the front desk know that morning and asked for a repair during the day. When we returned it hadn't been touched so we went back to the desk and a tech was sent. He said the filter was too dirty and he would fix it. It never did function correctly. The casino allows smoking and the low ceilings, combined with a poor air filtration system made it uncomfortable (we are non-smokers). If you want internet (wireless) access the hotel wants to charge $12/day (which is ridiculous) but you can do down to the Krispy Kreme shop and get free access. The employees rarely smiled and many appeared like they didn't want to be there. There are only two restaurants and both are dated and marginal from a food quality standpoint. We had to send food back because it was cold and they appeared to be understaffed. In short we suggest that one look elsewhere.

The negative (though not bad enough to make me give a poor review): - The room elevators were quite slow during peak times. 3 of the 4 elevators were working, one was out of order. If there were a lot of people waiting to catch the elevator up, you could quite easily wait 5-10 minutes. Similar waits on my floor while waiting to go down. At non-peak hours it was just a couple minutes. Garage elevators were just fine. - Very slow drain in the bathroom sink, which would back up and gunk would come up and out into the sink. I assume the maids knew about it, since they did clean the sinks and running the water would cause it to back up, but it was not attended to. The neutral: - Room was a bit frayed and worn around the edges, but I knew that going in, having read other reviews. Plus it was a smoking room - not like they're going to replace things that will just get stunk up / burn marks etc. - My room was overlooking Fremont Street, which has a pretty loud sound & light show every evening (once every hour, on the hour, until about midnight.). Quite audible in the room, didn't bother me enough to switch rooms, but others may find it annoying (in which case, request a room on the other side of the hotel). - Loud A/C unit. I like a bit of background noise when trying to sleep, so it didn't bug me too much, PLUS it did help drown out the noise from Fremont Street. - Wish they had a mini-fridge in the room; there was more than enough space to place one. The positive: - The price, only $40/night during my stay. - Location: right on Fremont. If you've never stayed downtown and want to experience some of the older / original Las Vegas, this hotel is a good choice. However, Fremont is a bit limited and after a couple nights you may have already seen it all - an option here is to rent a car from the hotel (they have an Enterprise desk and cars on-site), and the hotel has a free parking ramp for guests, so you could drive to the strip and park at one of the hotels there for a night on the town, or take a drive to Hoover Dam & Lake Meade, or just explore other parts of town. I had rented a car at the airport ($9 per day weekend special from Enterprise) and parked free at the hotel, and did get a good bit of use out of it. Easy to catch a taxi to the strip as well. Depending on time of day, a drive the hotel and the airport, utilizing the interstate, can take less than 20 minutes. - Room size: was quite large compared to other budget-friendly places I have stayed previously (on the strip). More than enough room for 2 or 3 people. - McDonald's and Krispy Kreme on-site, for when you want a quick bite but do not want to wait in line for the area restaurants. At peak times, every single restaurant / buffet will have a line, there is no avoiding it. - Proximity to other casinos etc: walking distance to numerous casinos, buffets / restaurants, bars, vintage neon signs at the Neonopolis, souvenir shops, convenience & liquor stores up & down Fremont, and a few other casinos right outside the Fremont \"experience.\" Notes: Fremont does have its share of local vagrants and such, but I never felt threatened and they generally just seemed to hang out more than anything - was only asked for change once. You're allowed to walk around on Fremont with open containers of beer, drinks etc, so there's a chance you may see a few folks stumbling around, but the police presence was noticeable and never did I see any negative activity.

The hotel is in the \"old\" part of town, right at the beginning of the Fremont Street Experience. Anytime I get THREE NIGHTS FREE, which we did with the tournament, I think it's excellent! The hotel itself is a bit tattered and worn (but clean) - and the ventilation systems are not quite as good as the newer casinos. Things feel a bit \"tighter\" than in the sprawling taj mahals on the strip. But overall, the good outweighs the bad. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, for one thing. The buffet is very good and free drinks are served often. There is a Walgreen's Drug store steps from the front door. And best of all, when you play in a tournament, you get three nights' room absolutely FREE. In addition, (and I assume this applies to other tournaments), we received four meal vouchers (for the player in the tournament and a partner) and two other tournament meals, an evening buffet and a breakfast, and player shirts. Now, HOW GREAT IS THAT?? The keno tournament is held 4 times a year, but they also host other tournament events, which, I am guessing, have similar perks. In the keno tournament, you put up $500, but get the full amount back to play in the tournament, and you get to keep all your winnings. Of the approximately 100 players, about 1/4 earned all their money back. The top winner took home over $11,000. We met some \"regulars\" at the tournament who said, \"Why stay on the strip when the only thing I need my room for is to sleep?\" The sleeping rooms are adequate, the beds very firm, and the shower was hot. Depending on the time of day, the four elevators could be slow, but that's true with any high-rise hotel. For those unfamiliar with Fremont Street, it is 5 blocks of pedestrian mall with a 1,400 foot canopy light show - billed as the world's largest. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. Also available in the mall area are small shops, drug stores, other casinos, and restaurants - all within easy walking distance, unlike the strip. There is nightly entertainment outside your front door. The Deuce Bus, which runs the length of the strip, is available for $5/day, so it's easy to get out to the other end of the strip if you want to tour other casinos or go to a show. So, check out Fitzgerald's Casino. Las Vegas deals are still there, if you know where to look!

VERY BAD first impression. The guy checking us in didn't even make eye contact with us. We complained twice before getting a king bed the next day. We had to switch rooms and had to wait on them to switch. Our room was average, very few TV channels, small TV, cheap furniture. The bed was pretty comfortable, but the A/C was loud and didn't work very well. The bathroom was average size and the water pressure is good, but the wall paper was pealing off and the shower head was loose and coming out of the wall. The housekeeping was average, but the second night we noticed a shortcut taken. They put a full size bed sheet across the king bed sideways instead of getting a king size fitted bed sheet. This is a bad sign! Parking is free, access the self-parking garage from the rear (3rd St.), just write your name and room number on the ticket and you'll never pay for parking. Otherwise, I think it's $1.50/hr. Some of the buttons didn't work on the old phone and there were no maps of the casino telling you where anything was. Fremont St. is pretty neat with shopping and access to the other casino's within a short walk. There is McDonalds and Krispy Kreme donuts in the Fitzgerald's, and Dunkin Donuts in Four Queens. We didn't eat at the casino restaurants, but they looked ok. The Fitzgerald's, and the rest of downtown, is a long way from the Strip. You shouldn't walk it. It's too far, plus it's not safe walking around downtown outside the safety of the casino's. If you do go to the Strip, park at the Excalibur, which is street level and free parking, and it's a short walk to the rest of the Strip. The dealers at the casino are friendly and never felt crowded during the week. Traffic is horrendous on the Strip and especially bad in the morning and afternoon from 3-6pm because thousands of workers need to get to work in a few block radius.

The television is ok but the choice of channels is limited. Closet space good. Furniture is ok and not worn. The bathroom was clean and there is plenty of counterspace for personal toiletries. The hotel provides your basic soap and shampoo and these were adequate. Lack of an exhaust fan means that moisture will remain on the walls and ceiling, which in turn means mold. Just abit of mold above the shower. A serious problem is the shower curtain. Some idiot did not include a plastic curtain to go with the fabric one which means water on the floor every time I used the shower. I had to use a bath towel to sop up water. One good slip on the floor and you can say lawsuit! The shower faucet had a leak (waste of water). Unlike other hotels in Las Vegas the Fitz does not seem ecology minded (they don't ask guests to conserve water and reuse towels). The air conditioner was fine and not too noisy and does help cover some of the music from the Fremont Experience. The Fitz badly needs window washing. The exterior corridors are clean with less wear or wall marks than I have seen at some upscale hotels including the Luxor. Major problem is the elevators. Only three of the four were in operation and a few times I waited for 10 minutes for one. This could be a big problem in a medical emergency (there are separate service elevators not accessible to the public). The hotel itself is clean and fairly easy to navigate. The casino seems easily accessible for those who are handicapped (not so in certain other hotels). Directional signage could be improved. One good thing is that the hotel/casino is not so big that one spends 20 minutes getting to a restaurant. There are some entertainment options that I did not partake. The buffet is closed until later in Sept. The restaurant does not have a huge selection or variety on the menu but it 's not too expensive and the portions are large. My one big complaint is that sometimes noise from renovations in the buffet area can interfere with eating (why not give some discounts for the trouble). Oh yes. This is not a 24 hour restaurant except on weekends; other times there is McDonalds. The steakhouse looks good but I did not try the food (reservations suggested and I suggest dressing up some). The Vue bar has outdoor seating above street level. It has appetizers that come from the restaurant. Customer service is good and staff seem friendlier than at hotels on the Strip. Housekeeping did a good job. I had no problems with check-in or check-out but then there were no lines of people. My overall impression is that the Fitz is ok for the budget minded and especially if one gets a cheap package deal. It is close to the Duece bus stop. I won't comment on the gambling but as nearby gaming options are easily walkable the Fitz has a good location. Fitzgeralds compares in quality to the Riviera but is less expensive. I hope they add some elevators, and please, get a good shower curtain!", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo", "Title": "\u201cOverall \"great\"\u201d", "Author": "j1golfer", "ReviewID": "UR8609307", "Content": "I have stayed downtown Vegas for at least the last 10 years.

They showed only one room for three people. (These were pre-paid rooms through a travel agency) Luckly, they had extra rooms, but I had to pay again since they showed no record of the second room. In all the times I had been this seemed to have been the busiest time ever. The elevators weren't working properly and they took us along with others up to our rooms through the service elevators. There were two elevators that were not working. One of which I found out later was due to impatient guest who over loaded it and it fail and engered three people who we heard on the evening news went to the hospital. Monday and Tuesday seemed more pleasant until 1:30am Wednesday morning when someone in my party went to take a shower and due to the forceful water pressure the shower head blew off and hit them flooding the bathroom floor. We had rec'd notice the water would be turned off between the hours of 2:00am and 4:00am Wednesday morning. The shower head incident occurred prior to the time. But, after that time about 5:30am I heard a drip, drip, drip, and got up to investigate and found that the faucet to the vanity sink was running and even throuh the stopper was not closed the sink had filled up and was overflowing onto the bathroom floor. (I'm sure this probaly was due to the excessive water pressure when the water was turned back on.) When maintenance was called we were told they would be right up. (Ya, right!!! 3.5 hrs later). One of the people in my party had to come to my room to shower. When we checked out we spoke to the manager who absolutely showed no empathy , but offered to buy us lunch. (We had just had breakfast and were checking out. Useless!!!)

Standing on your toes you can see the corner of the Fitzgeralds balcony bar. The Nov. rising sun provides plenty on reading light in the low wattage room. You can hear the bass of the Fremont Street Experience. The sound is not real bothersome to me with the air conditioner and TV on. I did not have a problem sleeping, but most people will be bothered. The stairs next to the room come out on the 1st floor inside the high roller roped off area, but that was not useful to me. I could not find a door to the second floor on the stairs. The rooms above (423 & 523 maybe) on floors 4 & 5 dirextly abone appear to have a curved window in the corner of the room, while 323 does not. Fitzgeralds does not have in room internet access, but does have a public (pay?) room downstairs.

We had a wonderful time and to my surprise they are improving almost all of the hotels and casinos, the streets are cleaner and feel safer, some of the old empty warehouses are opening clubs and eaterys, it was the highlight of our trip. I'm so glad I convinced my friend to stay at Fitzgeralds. Yes, it's older and much smaller than some of the fancy shmancy ones on the strip but that was fine with us.

Try going to the strip for breakfast on $7.00. Any buffet down on the strip is more like double what you pay here. The casino is fantastic for payoffs on slots. I played a lot of slots and more times than not cashed out ahead. The slot attendents were always around to help with change or whatever. The cocktail waitresses were always coming by. I don't think I ever waited more than 5-10 minutes for a drink while playing the slots or table games. The table dealers are pretty friendly. They make it fun to play there. Cabs to the strip are a bit spendy, but if you don't want to cab it, take the Duece double decker bus that comes by. For $5 you can ride for 24 hours anywhere from downtown to the end of the strip.

When we arrived they had our room totally not as requested, then changed us to a room that had no refridgerater in it, less towels and wash clothes than were needed and as we were only staying minus flying time 2 days, waiting to try to get what we needed took up most of our 1'st day. Our air conditioner did not work and it was over 100 degrees there. I had reserved and arranged and paid for my disabled father and mother in law and their room was not handicapped and they had the wrong kind of bed requirement as we did. The only friendly people were the ones in the restaurants inside the hotel. Staff on the second floor of the casino at one point were not to be found and it was not busy there. It has definitely gone very downhill since our last visits and all of them were in the last year. Will not stay again there, nor gamble there again. Also shower water was cold and housekeeping entered our room while we were in there without even knocking, and there was a doorbell outside our room. So steer clear of there if you can! It spoiled our trip there and this was our son's graduation present, whom was a Special Ed student that should have been fun, but we spent too much time, trying to get needs met and could not see all that he wanted to see. We were told they would try to change our room the next day, but never happened and then they messed up our billing and we had to spend time getting that straightened out. In fact it was so bad and can be a little harder trying to travel with a wheelchair that it has caused me to reconsider travleling again, as it is expensive all way round as we flew from Michigan, 1800 miles, not to run into a problem every time we turned around at the hotel!", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201crude staff, dirty rooms\u201d", "Author": "saja1949", "ReviewID": "UR5729948", "Content": "We booked a great travel package so stayed at the Fitz.

Fun book included two for one drink specials, discounts on hotel logo stuff, a little money off on shows. and a $5.00 match play blackjack or roulette, I did the roulette and got $15.00 back. My room was on the 21st floor, out of I think, 34 floors in the hotel. For an extra 10 bucks, I got an upgraded room, as is my custom. Room # 2134. $39.00 plus $10.00 + $49.00 plus tax, so call it $55.00 a night total.. No extra hidden fees but you were warned of a charge for local calls at $1.00 each and even more for long distance. I used my cell phone, good signal strength from Cingular in the room. Checking in and out was no problem. Electronic door lock and 2 keys. No bugs. I had heard complaints about the elevators but I had no problem with them. There were 4 and they moved pretty fast and there was only a reasonable wait time for them. 21st floor hall was in good shape with new carpet in appealing patterns but it had begun to come up at the seams but I guess hauling those heavy baggage carts around will tear any carpet up over time. Ice machine and soft drink vending machine near the elevators. Quiet in the room, no sound from the hall nor from other rooms except some sound of running water in the bathroom. The A/C could be considered loud by some but I am a city boy and not used to the quiet, so for me it was just a little background \u201cwhite\u201d noise. Comforting in a way. King sized bed, bedding was fine. 3 pillows plus 2 extras from the shelf in the alcove. Mattress was fine. One could feel the springs through the pad if you worked at it but it was not noticeable when sleeping. The best bed I had so far was at the California, that may have had that memory foam pad, anyway it was a nicer bed than at TI. In the room there was the bed with wall mounted headboard and two night stands, misc. lamps, alarm clock, a small desk and chair, an easy chair on the wall common with the bathroom, a round table and 2 chairs near the window, a dresser and armoire with TV above and drawers below. All in great shape, no sign of wear and everything worked. There was even a shoe buffing machine. Decent sized color TV that got local channels, live Keno and tourist infomercials and CNN. Not a problem because I don\u2019t go there to watch TV anyway, just the local weather and later the weather back home. Remote control worked fine. Carpet, a \u201clucky Irish\u201d green color, was in good shape, no wear and was clean. General room decor was pleasant. A very few black marks where wall met the luggage carts but not really noticable. Housekeeping staff was efficient but not all spoke English. so there were a few Fawlty Towers moments when the statement that \u201cI will be back at a certain time and please be done by then\u201d was not always understood. One wall was waist to ceiling windows facing west. You had a view of the hotels nearby with mountains in between., you could just see the time and temperature on top of Binions. That was handy to see how hot it really was. 103 at sundown one day, an hour or so later it had dropped 10 degrees to a bone chilling 93. In late afternoon, with the hot sun on the windows, even with the A/C on high and the black out curtains shut, the A/C struggled to keep it cool. It was not hot but could have been cooler. The curtains blew around a little while the A/C was on. Bathroom was fine, it had a tub and shower, a long marble countertop with one basin. Good stuff in small bottles, about standard, not a name brand but it smelled good. 3 sets of bath towels, hand towels and wash cloths. These were not as soft as at home but nor were they the sand paper you get at a lot of places. Shower as fine, the water pressure was very strong, almost too strong, think fire hose. There was no way to turn down the volume of water. After a while in the shower there was some water built up in the tub. By no means a problem for me. Also, in the bathroom was a coffee maker with 2 cups. ample supply of plastic glasses. A hair dryer that started out mounted on the wall then fell off due to a poor anchor bolt. I reported it and it was fixed promptly. Some un-gluing of wallpaper above the shower, probably due to humidity. No closet, your clothes were on a rod in an alcove on your right as you first walked in. A good number of wooden hangers. Shelf above for other stuff. Also an iron and ironing board. Stout room safe mounted in the wall of the alcove, used a key. The hassle with that was where to put the darn thing. I personally prefer a electronic combo safe for that reason. Internal volume was maybe 14 inches by 12 by 4 deep. Probably as big as the one at TI but smaller than the one at California. Not quite big enough for a full sized lap top, you could probably put 2 large hard cover books side to side, with a little room to spare. No fee to use the safe. The ground level pool was nice but nothing fancy. A rectangle maybe 30 by 20 and 5 feet deep max. A few palm trees but nothing elaborate. Ample plastic loungers and a good supply of towels. No attendant nor life guard but there were cameras. I noticed security ask a couple with 2 small babies not to put them in the pool. Maybe for safety reasons but frankly they did not look housebroken to me. You could call from drink service. Plenty of sun in mid August and I think it would be sunny in all but the coldest months. Pool was a street level with a wall on 3 sides and a fence on the 4th side facing a drive way. Not right on the street, so no problems with people passing by. Your room key opened a gate. There were washrooms nearby accessed with your room key. Pool was open 7:00 am to 11:00 pm.

They were shocked to see the condition of the bathroom and immediatly set forth to fix the problem like it should have been done in the first place. When they left, we could have \"eaten\" off of the floor or any other surface of that room. I wish we would have gotten their names, because they definately should have been rewarded for THEIR excellence. To bad the rest of the housekeeping help wasn't even half as good as them.

The beds were not very comfortable but after staying out gambling till the wee hours it didn't bother us too much, if we were staying more than two nights it would have really disappointed me. The comments about the elevators were completely true. We waited about ten minutes every time we had to go up to our room. And coming down, we stopped at nearly every floor. Plus, the elevators were hot and because of the long waits, you were often crammed in with a lot of others making for an uncomfortable ride. We used the parking garage and that was a horror as well. The valet takes up the first six floors and maneuvering around is difficult , especially with a bigger car. I'm sure there have been plenty of accidents in there. The pool is small and located next to the parking garage, but it was very clean and uncrowded. Another plus, its open till 11pm, unlike some strip properties.

I have to commend the hotel staff as very friendly. On previous occasions we gambled at their 5 cent slots and found them loose and enjoyed the long play, but this time they were very tight. This was the first time we stayed in overnight in their rooms. We prefer larger rooms and asked for a suite. We were told customers can ask for upgrades when they check in, but cannot reserve suites ahead of time. We were also told that they had deluxe rooms (regular rooms), the club suite (for player's card holders, when available), and luxury suites (which were supposedly very nice and an additional $100 a night). We also asked about internet access which I need for my work, and were told yes, it is available. When we arrived, we upgraded to a club suite because no luxury suites were available. The only difference between a club suite and a regular (deluxe) room is a coffee pot, hair dryer, ironing board and bottles of water. The room size is no different than a regular room. There were no luxury suites available. The club suites were small rooms, with two beds, poor a/c-fan circulation and a flickering tv set. Since we didn't plan to spend much time in the room, we decided to rough it. This worked fine until the elevators quit working. Two days in a row, my husband walked down 11 floors of stairs along with many other guests. At least we were not on the 32 floor as some of his companions were. The elevators would go on the blink and stop at every single floor all the way up to 32 and all the way down to one. We were unable to board a down elevator during this time, so in order to use the elevator and not walk (which was not an option for me) we were forced to get on the elevator traveling up from floor eleven to floor 32, then back down to floor one. This took 25 minutes each time with nauseating stops at every floor all the way up and back down. I am diabetic, bad knee, and have Meniere's (a type of motion sickness). When we called the front desk to request a service elevator (which were working) for my transportation, we were refused. We explained that I had taken a insulin shot and needed to eat within 30 minutes, but were still refused. They offered to send room service but we knew that would take over an hour. I rode the elevator, without recourse, and we just stayed downstairs and avoided the rooms and elevators. As far as we know, no one was offered compensation for the inconvenience. We checked out a day early due to the elevators, and during check out we asked a bell hop if the elevator problems occurred often, and he nodded.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, england", "Title": "\u201cThe jolly green giant\u201d", "Author": "philij", "ReviewID": "UR4999395", "Content": "3rd stay at fitzgeralds...clean rooms...got a room change no problem...one of the best downtown hotels.

I decided on average because when we returned from our 10 day stay at Fitzgeralds last year, I wrote a letter to management complaining about several issues that we had while we were there. THE NEGATIVES: When we checked in, we were told that the room with a king bed that I had reserved several months in advance was not available and that we would have to take two double beds instead. The desk clerk knew we were on our honeymoon, but refused to upgrade us or try to accomodate us regarding this. If we wanted a suite, she informed us it would be an extra $100 per day. We were on the 27th floor and when we arrived there, we found that the soda machine on our floor was broken and the ice machine dispensed so slowly it took almost five minutes to fill a bucket. Therefore, whenever we wanted a beverage, we had to go up or down a floor. We were also very disappointed that there was no refrigerator in our room, which was a major annoyance due to the length of our stay. Also, with several restaurants in the hotel, we were very surprised that they offered no room service. The elevators were very slow while we were there. We waited on average 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. We really didn't mind waiting for them unless we were in a hurry. Which wasn't often because we were on vacation! We ate twice in Molly's buffet; one lunch and one breakfast. Compared to other buffets available in Vegas, this one we found to be overpriced and very limited in selection. Disappointing. We also ate at their coffee shop which is attached to the buffet on our last night there. This was most definitely the worst service we received during our stay. We waited almost half an hour just for the waitress to take our order, then were forced to order off of an extremely limited \"late night\" menu, then waited nearly an hour for our food. Not a great experience. THE POSITIVES: Our room was surprisingly spacious with an absolutely breathtaking view of the mountains. It was also extremely clean. We had housekeeping in every day to clean and they always left us extra towels and linens without us even having to ask. The room had a small safe so we were able to safely store our valuables as well. With the exception of the desk clerk that checked us in, we absolutely loved the staff at Fitzgeralds! Everyone was unfailingly friendly, polite and helpful, from the cocktail waitresses, table dealers, bartenders, cashiers, security, everyone! Plus, since we were there for 10 days, many of them took notice of us and went out of their way to greet us specially and make conversation. We felt very wanted there and it was wonderful. The casino was great! The slots were pretty loose espeically when compared to the strip. Plus, my husband tried his hand at blackjack, which he had never played before. The dealer went out of his way to help him and gave him tips on how to play! We also loved the balcony that was off of the bar on the second level. It overlooks Fremont Street and is a great place to sit and watch the light show and just watch the people. They also had karaoke several times while we were staying there and the host was excellent with a great book. Long rotation though, which is par for the course. So, at the beginning of my review, I mentioned that I wrote a letter to management. Well, it took 8 months but I received a response from the Vice President of Operations last November. He apologized for the inconveniences that we suffered during our honeymoon and offered us a return incentive.

We played mostly at Fremont, Binion's and Golden Nugget where we've stayed at in the past and always get comped for our meals. All are decent hotels for the price, especially the Golden Nugget. Fitzie's parking garage was a little aggravating - valet parking takes up the first 6 floors. Parking was hard to find at certain times and the garage is very narrow so watch out for those tight turns. The best thing about downtown is the ability to walk to ten different casinos in minutes and have easy access to table games. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!

Checked in at around 5:15pm Friday 3/17. We were amazed, there was no one in line to check in! We always come to Vegas on the Friday around St Patricks Day and about the same time of day. We have waited in line at other hotels anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to check in! Asked to be put on an upper floor away from Fremont street, and although the hotel was totally booked (St Patrick's Day & March Madness) request was happily granted. We were given a great room on the 31st floor. We were a bit worried because of some of the comments about the elevators I had read, but our concerns were unfounded. We only had to wait one time during our whole stay and then not more than 3 or 4 minutes. The elevators were very fast. Stayed away from Molly's Buffet until the last night..again, due to the comments I had read. This buffet is not that bad. The selection is small, but everything offered was excellent. We used the discount coupon from the fun book so we didn't pay full price. We both agreed that if we had not gotten a discount we might have felt that it was too expensive for the offerings compared to other downtown buffets. Had a great time at the casino..no big wins, but that's par for us. Great service from cocktail waitresses. Probably better than other downtown casinos. These people crack us up when they complain about rooms. With the turn-over in these hotels, and the way a lot of people treat property, they can and will get a little \"worn\" between refurbishings. We have stayed at several strip locations over the years and have to say that once you get on the elevator there isn't much difference from one property to the next. As a matter of fact, one of the worst rooms we ever had was in a higher priced popular strip hotel. Our room at The Fitz was clean upon arrival and was maintained during our stay.

When we checked in, we inspected the room and found ink like stains on the bed linens, so we called the front desk and asked for a room change. The original room was 1841. The front desk said they would change us, and to come down to the front desk to switch out the keys. Having experienced this problem previously elsewhere, many hotels will bring you new keys, instead of making you hall all luggage down to the front desk and then to the new room. It was a minor problem in comparison to the next one I\u2019ll detail, but a problem nonetheless. When we checked into our new room 1941, we noticed the same type of ink like stains on the linens. From this, we just thought it\u2019s a problem in every room, and at least the stains were not directly in the center of the bed. The entry way light blinked violently, and instead of reporting it we decided just not to use it. Our biggest problem with our stay, came from our first night and involved housekeeping. At about 1:15am we were awoken by knocking on our door. In my experience, when you don\u2019t answer people will realize they have the wrong room and walk away \u2013 but this was not the case. I heard a voice say something resembling \u2018housekeeping\u2019 and they barged into the room. Obviously we were confused, and yelled at the person to get out. They replied by saying something neither of us understood and left. Because of this incident, we had extremely poor sleep that first night, waking up every hour. The next morning, I went down to the front desk to complain to the manager about this incident. I asked the attendant for the manager, but she wanted to help me so I decided to tell her about the incident. She seemed willing to help, and contacted the housekeeping supervisor for an explanation. After the phone call, I impressed upon her that I needed an explanation as to why housekeeping people are coming to my room at 1:15am. I told her the only logical conclusion I could think of, is that they were looking to steal personal belongings. The attendant didn\u2019t disagree with my impression. She said I\u2019d be notified as to why housekeeping came into my room, and I told her I\u2019d be waiting in my room for a call. The call and explanation never came, and I was too busy to worry about it until I got home. Because of this unwanted and disturbing intrusion, we were extremely mindful to not have any maid service come into our room for the remainder of my stay, always keeping the privacy please sign, bolt lock and sliding lock on the door. It deprived us of one of the qualities I really look for in a hotel \u2013 safety. The only other concern I had about my stay, is the availability of internet at \u2018reasonable prices\u2019. As per your business center, $12 an hour is not reasonable to pay for internet. I am really disappointed in the a la carte nature of Las Vegas hotel casinos, believing that because they offer restaurants and slot machines, they can skimp on the things a traveler demands in any other city in the world. I am talking about a gym and business center, free of charge to hotel guests. Those are the bare minimum in my opinion, for a decent hotel \u2013 so if you want to elevate yourself among your competition, you\u2019d add them free of charge. I would appreciate a written response to the problems I\u2019ve taken the time to detail here, especially the late night housekeeping debacle. This is not the first time I\u2019ve stayed in Fitzgeralds, but I\u2019d seriously consider it being the last based upon the discrepancies I\u2019ve detailed.

It was great to walk up and down and see all the attractions that were offered. The gentleman that was juggling liquor bottles while making drinks was amazing. The rooms were fantastic as was housekeeping. We had a large queen size bed and it was every bit as comfortable as my own bed at home. The bathroom was a good size and there was plenty of hot water and pressure. Everyone of the staff was pleasant. The cocktail waitress were effeciant but not to the point of being a bother. We ate at the buffet several times and everything was hot and very tasty. There was a very good selection of foods. Both at the breakfast and supper buffets. We had breakfast in the resteraunt the morning we were leaving and the staff were great about us leaving our luggage beside our table. We went to a couple of the shows Larry G Jones and the Elvis show and they were both great. The entertainers themselves came through the buffet and offered 2 for 1 coupons to their shows.We were with a bus tour and had on our tour tags. The only thing we found that was somewhat of a bother were that the elevators were very slow. You had to leave at least 20 minutes before you planned on leaving just to get down to the lobby on time. Once we know that we just factored that time in. The next time we go to Las Vegas we will have no fears of staying downtown again. Its just a short cab ride to the strip and it really doesn't cost all that much. The cab drivers we had were very friendly and helpful.

When we checked in, the woman at the desk ( I believe her name was Carole) was very friendly. We got rooms on the 23rd floor, but got all the way up there ( with all of our bags) and realized that the 23rd floor was non-smoking. We had to go all the way back down to the front desk, and get new rooms on the 12th floor. The rooms were just what I expected- the basics- no frills, but very spacious with a pretty large TV. Overall, I was happy with the room (and the view). We had a few problems with the elevators, as there are only 4 in the hotel (and there were many times that we would have to wait for the elevator as they were oftentimes too full). I didn't get to see everything that I had hoped to see while in Vegas (I stayed from 9/19-9/23) because it was a pretty long trek to the strip from Fremont street with traffic. I liked the Fremont Street area though, and think it's a great place to stay when it's not your first time in Vegas and you're not heading back and forth to the strip every day to sight see. Overall, Fitzgerald's is a great hotel- especially considering the money you pay. The pool is a basic rectangular pool, located outside the building- but it does the job.

The casino, although a bit dingy, is full of a variety of table games and some of the loosest slots I have played in my many trips to LV. A good choice of table games with low limits and friendly dealers. The cafe' upstairs is OK (probably a 5 on a 1-10 scale) and is somewhat pricey for the market it serves. The buffet is a miss...without question...it shouldn't qualify for a buffet in Las Vegas...maybe 2 choices of entrees, a couple of side choices, a small salad bar and perhaps 3 or 4 desserts to choose from...severely lacking by Vegas standards and not exactly cheap (lunch is about $8) given the selections you are offered (Stations casinos run lunch buffets for about $7 and give you 10X the options not to mention Main Street Station down the block). The McDonalds on the first floor is 24 hrs which is nice for that quick bite but they have been out of ice cream and milk shakes on at least 50% of my visits...seems poorly managed, a bit dirty, and less than efficient compared to most fast-food stops. A gift shop exists across from the front desk which stocks a good variety of products but closes too early for a LV hotel (10pm).

We were excited to get a room so earlier in the day. We then we found out the room they gave us was a two double bed room instead of the King I requested. I called the desk and was informed that if I wanted to wait till 3pm I could have a King room. I opted to keep my room. The room was very nice and well kept. I had no complaints about the room. We then checked out the casino. The casino is small in size but has alot of slot machines to choose from with all types of denominations. We rate the casino as excellent. The only restaurant we ate at in the hotel was Molly's Buffet. We had breakfast there and it was excellent. The price was also good. We also ate dinner but that came at a price. I will explain. We were riding the elevator from our room located at the 32nd floor. We were in the elevator with an other couple who we did not know at the time. The elavator was travelling down when it made a loud noise and suddely stopped and jerked us around in the elevator. A few seconds later the door opened and we all decided to get out. A unknown woman entered the elevator when we exited and she became stuck in the elevator. We noticed that she got in before we could stop her and the door shut. The floor counter did not move and we heard the clicking on the elevator. We could hear the alarm being pushed from inside by the woman. A long story in a short form is that we called for help and the woman was rescued but we had to walk down 26 floors and then were only componsated with a free dinner buffet. The worst part was we had to use the elevator for the rest of our stay. Well back to the buffet, avoid eating dinner at Molly's it was terrible. I would not even recommend it for the cost of walking down 26 flights of stairs. The hotel does have a single outdoor pool and whirpool. Both of these items are very basic and would compare to what you would expect to find in a residental backyard. The casino does have a nice balcony that is accessable from the second floor and looks over fremont street experience. The hotel also has a great location being on the fremont street.

After staying on the strip for the past 3 nights, we arrived at the Fitz around 5:30 pm to check-in. The building smelled musty and old, but that was expected for it being an older hotel. The guy at the counter who helped me was not very friendly or helpful. I had called the hotel several days before checking in to confirm my reservation and request 2 beds in a N/S room-no probs, it was noted in the computer. When I asked the guy at the counter if a room with 2 beds was available he said 'yes', then told me we had to wait for approx. 2 hrs because the room was not ready. He said he would make a quick call up to the housekeeping supervisor to confirm the availability and after hanging up he said that it would be around 30 mins before it was ready. I was a little disappointed because we were checking into the hotel after 3pm, yet they did not have any clean rooms with 2 beds available. Furthermore, at the same time that I was checking in, a woman next to me at the counter had requested the same type of room and she got it-no problems. I stepped away from the counter and figured we would just wait around the lobby since it was only supposed to be a half hour wait. After about 10 mins of standing around and me probably looking really frustrated, the guy called me back over and told me another room was 'suddenly' available. He handed me the room key in the little folder and didn't even have the decency to give me directions to the room, muchless direct me to an elevator. The room ended up being on the very top-34th floor, in the corner, with a view of the top of the Freemont St canopy. When we finally got to the room it was very HOT and stuffy. We immediately located the A/C and turned it on....that thing was sooo loud that we were practically yelling at each others the whole time we were in the room. To make things worse, the darn thing wouldn't even cool the whole room off. In order to feel any kind of cool breeze, you had to be standing right in front of the unit. Part of the reason it probably never cooled was because the unit was not completely attached to the wall (there was a big gap between the inside wall and outside). We decided that we were going to just deal with it, as we were going to be outside on Freemont St for a good part of the night and we figured that if we left it on while we were gone it would cool off some by the time we got back. That was a big mistake because when we finally got in, it was sooo hot that it was practically unbearable to sleep. Not only was the room temp uncomfortable, but the beds were as well....double beds w/springs poking at your back!!! We somehow made it though the early morning hours and were ready to check out.

Enjoyed the Freemont Street Experience and the evening bands. Great shops within walking distance, everything half the price compared to on the strip. Walking distance to the bus stop. For five dollars per day you can ride the bus for 24 hours. Did fairly well with the VLT's. Wish the employees would have tried harder with bringing the drinks while we gambled, we usually tipped one dollar minimum per drink. More if they returned more often. Booked a day trip to the Grand Canyon, was enjoyable but a bit long. Still worth the time and money. A must see for anyone who has not seen it. We would stay at the Fitz again in a minute.

The Fitzgerald's is a very nice, well kept, fantastically located hotel/casino with extremely loose slots!!! We won enough in the first TWO HOURS in the casino to vacation extravagantly the entire weekend - renting limos, playing poker machines right up to the minute we left Vegas, buying clothes, eating out, etc. Honestly, I won more at Fitzgeralds than I did at the Hard Rock, Ceasars, The Venetian, etc. Our room was big with a view of Freemont Street. Everything was clean, including the sheets & the bathroom. The shower had GREAT water pressure. Air conditioning worked well. We were within walking distance to the bus stop, a drug store, the Golden Nugget, plently of places to eat, etc. etc. etc. (Krispy Kream donut shop is located in the lobby - yum - loved it) The staff were friendly in every part of the hotel & casino. This place isn't ritzy but it is PERFECT for somebody who wants a nice place to stay comfortably while saving money to do fun things rather than spend a fortune on a room to store your clothes & sleep!!! Do NOT hesitate to stay at Fitzgerald's Hotel & Casino in Vegas - THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!! Ignore the bad reviews on the internet - those people probably lost a little money in Vegas & want to take it out on the hotel.

We asked if a jacuzzi suite was available and one had just opened up, so for no additional cost, we enjoyed a huge room with a king size bed, loveseat, table and 2 chairs, great view of the mountains and part of the strip.

Those guests sensitive to noise should stay elsewhere. Also, the TV did not operate right, and the picture was frustrating. The bathroom was adequate, with vanity space. Good maid service. It's an OK place, nothing fancy. The location is great, in the center of everything on Freemont. If you can get a good deal on a room here, you might consider it. The casino is fun, but too noisy, with live music every night. If you play slots, it can be very distracting. Oh, one more thing---the elevator situation.

About an hour before we were ready to leave the Casino, we mentioned to the manager at the blackjack table that we were occupying the comped buffet tickets.

We were not expecting anything, like a meal when we arrived at the casino, but the floor manager offered and we thought that was a nice gesture. A few minutes later, the dealer shorted me on my winnings. When called to her attention, she was defensive. We got the manager on duty to come to the table and she called upstairs for a review of the tape. A few minutes later she told the dealer to pay me. NOT ONE TIME DID THE DEALER APPOLOGIZE TO ME.

Frankly, we were expecting an older room that might be in need of remodeling, but even that would have been acceptable.

Some people have complained about slow elevators and we didn't experience that at all. The longest we waited was perhaps one minute and most of the time it was only a few seconds. Also, and for those of you like me who schlepp their own luggage to and from the car, the parking garage elevators and the guest room elevators are only 50 feet or so apart. I've been in some hotels where it's a half-day hike! For me, it's little things like that that make a big difference. Same thing with the room.

I've never stayed downtown before, but I would book another room at the Fitz without hesitation! Our only complaint, and this is a tiny one, would be the parking garage.

We then decided about four years ago- we'd try the Fitzgerald. And we just love it and couldn't ask for more.! We get good comps- they run contests-food is delicious with a variety of restaurants. And with their card system - you can move to as many machines as you'd like and the points are given to you. The rooms are nice-but needed a little sprucing up-but from what I see -the new owners have just done that. Even a swimming pool has been put in.

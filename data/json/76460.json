It's the first time I have been in an extended stay type of property. It is apartment like, you get a kitchen, living room, small bath and two desks, you get free fully cooked breakfast buffet in the morning and a simple dinner, wine, drinks Tuesday through Thursday. This helps cut costs for families traveling with children and after traveling for six weeks, mine were happy to see something that looked like an apartment. Free internet in the business center, free coffee/tea all day, free laundry and no parking fees really cut down the cost of traveling, particularly with children. BEWARE, although pet friendly, be warned, they charge $75 for three nights and $150 for six nights (almost three times the cost of the hotel rental if you got a deal on Priceline). Nowhere at the front desk does it say that there is a fee, particularly one that increases after three days to $150. When I was automatically charged this on check-out, I was assumed to know this. Day clerks are really nice, night staff is a bit grumpy, particularly Roy. This is east Chatsworth, not a gorgeous area, but near the mountains with a nice nightly breeze. It's worth it if you can get a deal bidding on a room through one of the sites, expensive if you pay their going rate of $160-170 a night. A nice alternative to a hotel though and with a separate living room/kitchen (with pullout couch) and double doors to the bedroom, it's a good place to share with someone. My kids loved it. Maintenance people are spyish. Oh, if using Netspend or debit cards, beware. Every couple of days a $50 charge is put through for your incidentals. With Netspend, It takes 20 days to get your incidental charges reversed you don't request that they fax a release to your debit card company, bank debit cards have their own policies. Bottom line, if you can get this room through priceline (the only 3 star hotel in their area other than the Radisson which is also an extended stay type) for $75-80, it's a pretty good deal.

She was so sweet and helpful and put up with my multiple phone calls and answered any question that I came up. She even made sure that we had a 2 bedroom queen suite on the ground floor so that we didn't have to worry about navigating any uneven surfaces or stairs. After I made the reservations I started to worry if I had done the right thing renting a room so far away from The Villa, it turns out that I did exactly the right thing.

There are tons of great places to eat on Ventura Blvd and on North Topanga Canyon Drive as well as two of the best malls on the way to the Staybridge Suites that The Valley has to offer.

Because we visited over the weekend, no maid service of any kind was provided. So we had to be very thoughtful of how many towels we were using and how dirty things got, etc. I'll likely stay at this property again in the future but only because of its close proximity to friends and family in the area, and other lodging choices are limited -- but not because I actually enjoy staying at this hotel.", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Stay Ever\u201d", "Author": "HoustonDavid", "ReviewID": "UR7543986", "Content": "In more than 20 years of travel for business and vacations, I have never experienced anything like the terrible service I received at this hotel.

In the two previous visits I was pleased with their basic and reliable amenities of an extended stay. This time I received the worst treatment as a hotel guest I have ever experienced. Basically my family and I were suddenly shortchanged in our stay in order to accomodate some other hotel guest of \"higher priority\" for the management. I guess they just hoped that I wouldn't notice or that I wouldn't care that one day into the reservation the level of comfort of our stay had drastically diminished. What followed was a series of sixteen lies (yes, I counted) by the two managers at the front desk in order to cover up what they had done. Eventurally, the operations manager apologized profusedly and gave me points on my frequent stay card and 20% off on our NEXT stay (which we will not be using). This was not the way to get me to come back, but may be that was the point. By the end, it was pointed out to me how much the front desk managers felt they had gone out of their way in order to make things right AFTER I pointed out that they had lied repeatedly and made our pre-Christmas day miserable. The entire management staff needs some serious training on accountability, customer relations, and communication among staff.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "spach", "ReviewID": "UR5626746", "Content": "I loved the Staybridge suites at Chatsworth, definitely worth the money.

Yuck. Neighborhood where this hotel is located seemed very shady. Buildings were rundown and had bars on their windows. Would not recommend walking far at night. We asked for an upstairs room and received one on ground floor facing the dumpsters of a fast food place (door is to the outside, like a motel). Did not complain as we were staying only one night. Room was okay. Plenty of space with kitchen area but reminded us of a Super 8. Again, shady. No decent restaurants in the area but found a few chain places near mall a few miles away. Staff was okay but did not really ask them for anything. Included simple breakfast with typical toast and cereal, average but not bad.
